                  Healthy soil is critical to human health and for achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). Although India attained self-sufficiency in food production, realising zero hunger, good health, and no poverty remains a challenge. In this paper, we summarize key features of Indian soils and capture existing and developing trends in soil research in India to assess our preparedness to meet soil-linked SDGs. We begin by taking a stock of Indian soils, their nutrient status, and soil quality and explore some of the rapidly emerging areas of soil research to realize this goal. Given that the average soil organic carbon (SOC) content is around 0.54%, the majority of Indian soils are low in major and micronutrients. Large-scale soil testing in farmers’ fields suggests that more than 70% of soils suffer either from soil acidity or soil alkalinity. With about 29% of the total geographical area under the process of land degradation, deficiency of several plant nutrients is showing malnutrition in Indian population. Smallholder farms in India need new agricultural technology and their efficient delivery to farmers. Over the last decade, there have been ambitious Government programmes such as national soil health card mission and rapidly changing agricultural research ecosystem to promote smart sensing, robotics, remote sensing to name a few. The realization that farmers are to be associated with soil research and development, as is done in soil health card mission and public-private partnership such as Bhoochetna, sets in a new trend to enable the country and its citizens self-reliant.

Healthy soil is critical to human health and for achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). Although India attained self-sufficiency in food production, realising zero hunger, good health, and no poverty remains a challenge. In this paper, we summarize key features of Indian soils and capture existing and developing trends in soil research in India to assess our preparedness to meet soil-linked SDGs. We begin by taking a stock of Indian soils, their nutrient status, and soil quality and explore some of the rapidly emerging areas of soil research to realize this goal. Given that the average soil organic carbon (SOC) content is around 0.54%, the majority of Indian soils are low in major and micronutrients. Large-scale soil testing in farmers’ fields suggests that more than 70% of soils suffer either from soil acidity or soil alkalinity. With about 29% of the total geographical area under the process of land degradation, deficiency of several plant nutrients is showing malnutrition in Indian population. Smallholder farms in India need new agricultural technology and their efficient delivery to farmers. Over the last decade, there have been ambitious Government programmes such as national soil health card mission and rapidly changing agricultural research ecosystem to promote smart sensing, robotics, remote sensing to name a few. The realization that farmers are to be associated with soil research and development, as is done in soil health card mission and public-private partnership such as Bhoochetna , sets in a new trend to enable the country and its citizens self-reliant.

However, inclusive economic growth in India faces the challenges of balancing between urban and rural areas amid the daunting task of feeding an ever-increasing population. The country is growing fast through industrial and service sectors. Though the share of agriculture in the gross domestic product (GDP) is declining; yet, about 17-18% of national GDP comes from this sector and 58% of its 1.34 billion people depend on agriculture and allied sectors for their livelihoods. Growing population and increasing living standards, industrial development, and urbanization are putting tremendous pressure on our finite natural resources (Wani, 2021 ; Wani et al., 2021 ). Extraneous changes such as global trading and climate change further complicate local challenges. Under such conditions, meeting SDGs of no poverty, zero hunger and well-being, and achieving food security through climate resilient and sustainable development becomes a daunting task. Specifically, land use planning and sustainable management of soils require innovative approaches and involvement of multiple stakeholders for meeting SDGs. Thus, there is a need to evaluate existing trends in soil research and development in India. Soil and water are long recognized as parts of the five eternal elements (earth, water, fire, air, and ether) or the “pancha maha bhuta”  in ancient Indian literature.  Starting with classifying soils based on their fitness to grow specific crops or based on the source of water (viz., rain or a river), agriculture has remained the major focus of Indian economy since the Vedic  period. With the net sown area of about 140 Mha, the food grain production of 82 million tonnes (Mt) in 1960-61 before the green revolution period has increased to 308.7 Mt in 2020-21 in addition to the production of 36.1 Mt oilseeds, 399.3 Mt sugarcane, and 35.4 million cotton bales (MoA&FW, 2021 ). Despite these achievements, there is a growing concern on our ability to feed Indian population, which is slated to reach as high as 1.65 billion by 2060 (Supplementary Information, SI 1; Fig. S1). Increasing population is decreasing the per capita land availability; the land to human ratio of 0.39 ha in 1950 has indeed changed to 0.10 ha in 2021 (UN-DESA, 2019 ). Interestingly, a strong linear increase in the number of landholdings with the population growth may be seen in Fig. S1. With no room for agricultural extensification in India, the size of each landholding is decreasing. Almost 69% of the current 146 M landholdings are marginal farms (< 1 ha area), which makes agricultural mechanization a challenging task. There is also an increasing trend in land degradation and deterioration of soil health (Basak et al., 2021a ) with the total area under degraded land increased to 96.59 Mha (29.32% of total geographical area) in 2011-13 from about 94.53 Mha in 2003-05 (SAC, 2016 ). Erosion is the main pathway of soil degradation in India and an estimated 3 billion tonnes of soil gets eroded to the oceans annually (Gupta et al., 2021 ). Although India ranks high in terms of total production for several crops, their productivity remains low (Table S1). Thus, there is a concern of possible shortfall in food supply in just a decade ahead casting doubt on meeting the SDG goals of zero hunger. With green revolution, multidimensional poverty is declining although we continue to have malnourished children with 35.5% stunting and about 19.3% wasting (National Family Health Survey NFHS-5, 2019-21, 2022 ). A comprehensive study involving 100 countries has shown that the per capita demand for protein and calorie is slated to increase by 89 and 62%, respectively, for the low-income countries such as India by 2050 (Tilman et al., 2011 ). To address such challenges, there has been a call to double the farm income by 2022 through the adoption of integrated farming system approach, which involves the diversification of cropping system with the integration of different components including arable and horticultural crops, livestock, forage crops, etc. in the farm and integrated nutrient management. Such integrations require a clear understanding of the linkages between food security and soil health. Soil research in India has largely focussed on a) evaluating soil as an important natural resource through soil survey and mapping, b) developing soil test crop response (STCR)-based fertilizer recommendations with a goal to achieve higher crop yields and improved nutrient use efficiency, and c) improving irrigation efficiency through the efficient management of soil water regimes. Some of the contemporary efforts have started to treat agricultural production systems as an integral part of the critical zone. Moreover, research on new technologies in form of rapid and non-invasive sensing, internet of things (IoTs), digital soil mapping (DSM), and remote sensing approaches are also being initiated to make digital agriculture a reality. Furthermore, agricultural startup ecosystem is also rapidly changing in India. The overarching goal of this review is to summarize key features of Indian soils and capture existing and developing trends in soil research in India. We present salient features of Indian soils and their carbon footprint across different agroecological regions (AER), nutrient status and soil health, and opportunities in soil research and education in India. Salient experimental results on these critical soil aspects are described to assess our preparedness for meeting SDGs.  2 Key features of indian soils 2.1 Basic soil properties and function parameters The Indian subcontinent (area: 329 Mha; 8°4′ N-37°6′ N latitude, 68°7′ E - 97°25′ E longitude) is divided into 20 distinct AERs (Sehgal et al., 1992 ) based on bioclimate, the length of growing period, physiography, and soil types (SI 2). These were further divided into 60 agro-ecological sub-regions (AESR) (Velayutham et al., 1999 ) and finally modified into 84 AESRs (Bhattacharyya et al., 2021 ). Most of Indian soils have been mapped at 1:250,000 scale and a large volume of legacy data are available in krishikosh  (https://www.krishikosh.egranth.ac.in ) and Bhoomi  (https://www.bhoomigeoportal-nbsslup.in ) geoportals (SI 2). India has 8 major soil orders with over 1247 soil series belonging to Inceptisols (447), Entisols (367), Alfisols (174), Aridisols (93), Ultisols (61), Vertisols (55), and Mollisols (50) (Bhattacharyya et al., 2013 ). While developing digital soil maps, Reddy et al. (2021)  showed that soil properties are primarily influenced by elevation, valley depth and topographic wetness index (TWI). Majority of the Indo-Gangetic Plains including AER 13, AER 15, AER 9 and AER 4 are not only one of the most fertile belts of the world, but also have very high TWI values. In general, soil properties are better correlated to rainfall and temperature than terrain attributes (Fig. S3; SI 3). June rainfall and January temperature may be the key drivers of soil chemical properties such as soil pH and SOC contents in Indian soils. Low valley depth and high January (driest month of the year) temperatures have promoted high clay contents whereas high elevations and cold January temperatures promoted high sand contents in respective AERs. The AER-averaged key environmental covariates and DSM-estimated soil properties are shown in Table S2 for ready reckoning. Table S2 shows that high clay contents in the Deccan Plateau (AER 6) and adjoining areas, coarse textured eastern Indian soils, and high SOC contents in the Western Ghats & Coastal Plains (AER 19) and north eastern hill regions are some of the key features of Indian soils. Soil pH shows a decreasing trend with the increase in SOC contents, and a strong positive association between the whole profile clay contents and the whole profile SOC contents is reported. An average SOC content of 0.72% for the top 5 cm soil decreases to about 0.25% in the 100-200 cm soil layers for all the AERs. A comprehensive DSM study for key soil function parameters such as nutrient and water holding capacities for Indian soils is yet to be conducted. Recently, Chakraborty et al. (2020)  collated CEC data for 11 different states and observed an average CEC value of 21 cmolc  kg−1  with the coefficient of variations of 69%. Limited data for water retention and hydraulic conductivity is also available for Indian soils. In general, black soils and alluvial soils (∼51.06% of the total geographical area of India) have high soil water content at field capacity (FC: 23.74-31.07%) and permanent wilting point (PWP: 12.24-20.79%) as compared to other soil types (SI 4). Large variation in hydraulic conductivity (K s ) has also been reported for Indian soils (K s  in the range of 0.003 cm h−1  to 11.9 cm h−1 ). Several PTFs for estimating soil water contents at FC and PWP, Ks , K(h)  and water retention curves were developed for different AERs of India (Santra et al., 2008 ; Santra and Das, 2008 ; Adhikary et al., 2008 ; Chakraborty et al., 2006 , 2011 ; Shwetha and Varija, 2013 ; Patil et al., 2013 ; Santra et al., 2018 ; Dharumarajan et al., 2019 ). Because of limited area coverage and the size of contributing databases, consolidated efforts are needed to develop national soil hydraulic property databases for Indian soils.  2.2 Soil organic carbon and soil health The organic matter content of soils and, more specifically SOC stock, is critical for soil health and ecosystem function (SI 5). Total SOC stock in Indian soils is estimated to be 11.338 Pg (Bhattacharyya, 2021a ). Seven identified soil orders in India have different levels of SOC stock with Ultisols, Vertisols and Inceptisols contributing ∼82% (Fig. S4). When these soils were assessed in terms of their capacity to stock organic carbon, brown forest soils (Mollisols) were found to be the highest followed by other soils. Soil organic C and its different pools contribute differently in maintaining soil quality (SI 6). Long-term experiments existing in different AERs demonstrated that improving organic C status in our soils through external addition is difficult. Shifting from balanced to integrated application of organic sources (manures and composts) along with inorganic sources (NPK fertilizers) of nutrients for years together even at a fairly high rate of 5.0-10.0 Mg ha−1  yr−1  could increase SOC contents just by about 10-15% over the no organics (only NPK). Incorporation of crop residues curbs depletion of SOC contents. Interestingly, the rate of conversion of crop residue C to SOC was about 1.6 times (4.2 vs . 6.9%) more in the presence of organics compared to that in its absence suggesting that organics might have somehow facilitated this conversion of crop residue C to soil organic C. Extensive rather than intensive or in other words, more equitable application of organic amendments in fields may be advisable for increasing C sequestration in soils. This process may even be accelerated in the presence of legume than non-legume crops (Wani et al., 2003 ; Mandal et al., 2007 ). This was supported by the observed higher C sequestration rates in a long-term experiment under Vertisols at the International Crop Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Hyderabad with pigeon pea-based cropping system since 1976 (Table S4). Among different cropping systems, C sequestration in alluvial soils of Indo-Gangetic plains is higher under submerged rice soils compared to aerobic soils due to incomplete decomposition of organic materials and decreased humification of organic matter under flooded conditions (Benbi et al., 2012 ). Furthermore, intensive agriculture with improved nutrient and water management can increase water and nutrient use efficiency and crop biomass production, thereby increasing plant-mediated C input to soil and reducing the rates of organic matter decomposition. In the north Indian state of Punjab, intensification of agriculture with rice-wheat system improved SOC by 38% over a 25-year period (Benbi and Brar, 2009 ). The enhanced C sequestration rates resulted from increased productivity of rice and wheat. Besides improving crop yields, the intensification of agriculture saves emission that could occur because of bringing more land under cultivation for meeting the food requirement of growing population. Mandal (2011)  determined critical values for SOC using both relative yield (RY) and relative soil quality (RSQ) as SOC's goal effects. Soil quality was calculated by integrating several physical, chemical, and biological properties through multivariate statistical methods. They considered SOC values that caused 80 and 50% of the RY and RSQ as its ‘optimum’ and ‘threshold’ values, respectively. Results showed that for the rice-rice system in Alfisols  the optimum and threshold values of SOC were 7.3 and 4.4 g kg−1  when RY was taken as the goal effect (Fig. 1  a). These values were almost the same (7.4 and 3.4 g kg−1 ) when RSQ was used as the output. Similar estimates for the rice-potato-sesame system under Inceptisols  were also calculated (Fig. 1 b). Critical values for SOC as a key indicator for soil quality need to be determined for different soils under various AERs of the country for a first-hand assessment of soil health and also make recommendations for corrective measures for its upkeep. Terrestrial carbon stock for Indian soils is low and its build up strategies are a key to mitigate climate change impacts (Minasny et al., 2017 ). The reduction of emissions and fixing of CO2  call for action by one and all wherever the opportunities exist to reduce atmospheric concentration of CO2 . Under natural vegetation conditions, SOC values tend to attain quasi-equilibrium values (QEVs) with varying durations (e.g., 500 to 1000 years in a forest system, 5 to 50 years in agricultural systems after forest cutting, etc.) in different soils. For example, Vertisols in the sub-humid tropics in India under forest and horticultural systems may attain a QEV of 0.8 and 0.7% over a period of 30 years and centuries, respectively (Naitam and Bhattacharyya, 2004 ). Continuous cultivation of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum  L.) as a sole crop for 20 years and cotton plus pigeon pea [Cajanus cajan  (L.) Huth] for 50 years are shown to drastically reduce the QEV, suggesting that when shrink–swell soils are put to agricultural use, the QEV of SOC decreases. Because all these soils have similar clay mineralogy, the variations in QEV in these soils appear primarily because of the differences in land use systems. The similarity in substrate quality in Fig. 2   indicates that the soils under the agricultural system have the potential to attain QEVs similar to those observed in agricultural and forest systems. This could be achieved through the addition of farm yard manure (FYM) or other green manures (Bhattacharyya, 2021a , 2021b ), which could potentially increase the present QEV from 0.44 in soils of agricultural system to 0.51% observed in the soils of horticultural and forest systems in sub-humid tropical climate of India. Multi-location trials at 28 benchmark sites covering arid, semi-arid and moist humid tropical locations in India by the ICRISAT and its partners [National Bureau of Soil Survey & Land Use Planning (NBSS&LUP), Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), and Indian Institute of Soil Science (IISS)] revealed that after 20 years, the Vertisols had higher C sequestering potential than the Alfisols, the legume-based systems with high management sequestered more C than the cereals, the horticultural (fruit) systems and grass lands sequestered more C than the annual crop systems (ICRISAT, 2004 ; Bhattacharyya et al., 2007 ). Among the upland systems, the inclusion of legumes in rotation or as an intercrop (e.g., cotton) plus findings on increasing C sequestration in the ICRISAT were validated in the community watersheds using rainwater management as an entry point to increase and sustain crop productivity and increase farmers’ incomes. In addition to agricultural sectors, worldwide efforts have also started to limit the amount of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted by industries. To comply with these laws, large emitters such as power plants are allowed to either alter their own operations or pay others to reduce emissions using carbon trading (SI 7). Often it is less expensive for large emitters to pay others than to retrofit their operations to reduce emissions.  2.3 Soil nutrient status As early as 1947, Indian soils were known to be low in N; crops such as Egyptian clover, wheat in parts of Punjab, and crops grown on light textured soils responded to fertilizer P and those grown in lateritic soils responded to fertilize K application (Steward, 1947 ). During the green revolution period, deficiencies of several micronutrients emerged because of the cultivation of high-yielding crop cultivars, use of micronutrient-free NPK fertilizers, and farmers’ access to irrigation water (Benbi et al., 2011 ). Adoption of these technologies increased crop productivity from 710 kg ha−1  in 1961-62 to 2300 kg ha−1  in 2020-21, which helped India achieve self-sufficiency in food grain production transforming the country from a “ship to mouth” status to a net food exporter (Wani and Singh, 2021 ). However, large withdrawal of essential plant nutrients caused micronutrient and secondary nutrient deficiencies in many Indian soils. For example, field-scale Fe deficiency was noticed as early as 1960s and that of P and K during 1970s. Similarly, Zn deficiency in field soils was observed in 1969-70, just a few years after the introduction of high-yielding cultivars. A decade later (1979-80), Mn deficiency was observed in wheat and forage berseem (Trifolium alexandrinum ) in rice-wheat/berseem rotation in coarse-textured soils (Benbi et al., 2006 ). First reported during 1980-81, S deficiency is now recognized as the fourth major limiting nutrient following N, P and K. In the 1990s, B deficiency was reported followed by Cu during the last decade. The deficiencies appeared faster in the northern states compared to other parts of the country, which may primarily be attributed to the rapid adoption of Green Revolution technologies in irrigated areas. For presenting a typical picture of soil nutrient status in Indian soils, we used the farmers’ field data (n  = 178,037) collected from 12 different Indian states by the ICRISAT and their partners (Sahrawat et al., 2007 , 2011 ; Wani et al., 2012 ; Chander et al., 2013a , 2013b , 2014 ). Both the minimum and maximum values for soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC), SOC, and different nutrient contents are shown in Table S5. Fig. 3   shows the percentage of samples having different pH ranges (neutral, acidic, and alkaline) and samples showing deficiencies in different nutrient contents. Because SOC contents may be viewed as a proxy for available soil N, percentage of samples deficient in SOC contents are shown along with the other two primary nutrients of P and K. As expected, soil samples from farmers’ fields show a wide variation in soil pH ranging from highly acidic (pH ∼ 4.95) to alkaline (pH ∼ 9.59) soil reaction. Fig. 3  clearly shows that only 20-40% of soil samples had neutral soil reaction. On an average, 31% soil samples were acidic and 43% of samples were alkaline in nature suggesting that a large fraction of agricultural soils in India require soil amendments (lime or gypsum). This dataset does not include some of the high salinity areas (e.g., states of Punjab and Haryana) and, thus, the EC values in Table S5 range from 0.05-3.76 dS m−1  even with such large proportion of high pH soils. Typical, low SOC and low N contents of Indian soils are also reflected in the high percentages of samples with deficient (low) SOC contents (Fig. 3 ). With an average 55% of soil samples showing low SOC contents for these 12 states, the occurrences of >60% samples deficient in SOC contents in states such as Telangana, Jharkhand, and Andhra Pradesh are alarming because these states also have low forest cover suggesting overall low terrestrial SOC stock. A predictable outcome of soils with low and high pH is reflected in the large proportion of soils (∼41%) having P deficiencies. Fortunately, most of these states have reasonable soil K supply, which has traditionally supported Indian farmers to use less potassic fertilizers. Similar to K, most of the soil samples had sufficient available Mg with less than only 3% samples showing Mg deficiency. Overall, many soil samples showed S (34%), Zn (46%), and B (66%) deficiencies. Most samples with acidic pH had Ca deficiencies while samples with alkaline pH showed Fe deficiencies. Other estimates such as those from the All India Coordinated Research Project on micro- and secondary nutrients and the national Soil Health Card (SHC) mission suggest that the deficiencies of secondary and micronutrients range between 26-59% for S, 34-51% for Zn, 23-45% for B, 19-31% for Fe, 13-17% for Mn, and 5-11% for Cu. Similarly, deficiencies for the primary nutrients in Indian soils stand at 96% for N (82% low and 14% medium), 61% for P (20% low and 41% medium), and 62% for K (15% low and 47% medium). Moreover, deficiencies of more than one micronutrient along with primary nutrients in soils have also been reported at several locations in the country. Thus, both primary and micronutrient deficiencies have now become the major constraint in sustaining high crop yields in the present-day intensive agriculture across India. Over six decades of green revolution, the use of fertilizer nutrients has increased from 0.30 Mt in 1960-61 to 32.54 Mt in 2020-21. Of the 20.40 Mt N fertilizers and 8.98 Mt P2 O5  fertilizer consumed in India, 13.74 and 4.74 Mt of fertilizer N and P2 O5,  respectively, are produced in the country and the rest are imported. The entire amount of Muriate of Potash (3.15 Mt K2 O) and more than half of the urea consumed in the country is imported. Therefore, disruption of global fertilizer supplies and escalating energy prices arising from several geo-political factors could have a significant impact on the country's fertilizer availability (Bhattacharya, 2022 ). This is particularly important as Russia alone accounted for 60% of NPK and 17% of muriate of potash (MOP) imports of India. Though fertilizer use in India increased significantly, a huge mismatch still exists between the nutrient uptake by the crops and additions through fertilizers. For instance, the uptake of primary nutrients (NPK) by crops during 2015/16 was 36.6 Mt whereas the application of fertilizer nutrients was 26.8 Mt leaving a gap of 9.8 Mt (FAI, 2015 ). The gap widens to 13 Mt when nutrient use efficiencies are considered. The imbalance could still be higher in many regions because of great disparity in fertilizer use. Currently, 13 states account for 92% of total fertilizer consumption in the country. Apparently, the gap in fertilizer use is filled by indigenous soil nutrient supply leading to nutrient mining and degradation of soil fertility, thus, rendering the production system unsustainable. Nutrient-wise analyses revealed that the gap between nutrient uptake and application of fertilizer nutrients was largely on account of K, leading to its mining from the soil. Presence of K-bearing minerals, such as muscovite, biotite and illite in alluvial soils releases substantial amounts of non-exchangeable K towards K uptake by plants. This results in depletion of non-exchangeable K in soils, as observed by Benbi and Biswas (1999) . Depletion of soil K has been suggested as a possible cause for yield decline in long term rice-wheat experiments (Benbi and Brar, 2009 ). Furthermore, the deterioration of soil fertility is evident from progressively declining fertilizer response ratio from 12.1 kg grain per kg NPK in 1960-69 to 5.1 kg grain per kg NPK in 2010-17 (Gupta et al., 2021 ). In general, fertilizer use efficiencies in Indian soils are low (N: 30-45%, P: 15-25%, K: 50-60%, S: 8-12%, and micronutrients: 2-5%) as compared to developed countries and the global average of 59% (Gupta et al., 2021 ). Such low use efficiencies are often attributed to imbalanced nutrient application, the lack of site-specific and integrated nutrient management (INM), and little or no recycling of crop residues. Current fertilizer consumption in India is clearly skewed towards N: 32.54 Mt of NPK fertilizer use in 2020-21 consists of 20.40 Mt N, 7.66 Mt P (as P2 O5 ), and 3.15 Mt K (as K2 O) yielding N:P:K use ratio of 6.7:2.4:1. Fertilizer N is a key factor for increasing productivity provided balanced nutrient approach is adopted else the law of minimum kicks in. On an average, each tonne of fertilizer N consumed in the country enhanced food grain production by 10 tonnes (Benbi, 2017 ). However, fertilizer N efficiency has declined from ∼75 % in late sixties to ∼15 % suggesting imbalanced nutrition.. To summarize, inherently low nutrient contents in soils, nutrient depletions and emerging nutrient deficiencies because of crop removal, imbalanced fertilizer use, and declining factor productivity are some of the challenges in Indian agriculture. Second, the interplays between water and nutrients are relatively less attended or are not available in form of specific recommendations that can be delivered to farmers. For sustainable food grain production, adequate replenishment of nutrients and minimizing disparity in fertilizer use are essential. Currently, the majority of surplus crop residues are burnt in the field, which must be stopped. The return of crop residues to soil besides bringing the much-needed organic matter back to the field favourably impacts soil health through improved physical and biological attributes (Benbi et al., 2015 ). With per capita land availability being already low, any further increase in food grain production will come through efficient management of resources aimed at maintaining or enhancing soil fertility. Researchers in India are developing management practices for enhancing soil health and minimizing nutrient depletions, which inter alia  include soil test-based balanced fertilizer application, rationalizing P application in a crop sequence, INM, residue recycling, drip and sprinkler irrigation with fertigation in high-value crops, and conservation agriculture.   3 Land degradation and food security 3.1 Land degradation and soil health Diminished ability of land to support soil functions or services required for sustainable intensification results in large yield gaps between potential yield and actual yield in farmers’ fields (Wani, 2021 ). Land is the base for all primary production systems and is a non-renewable resource. Of late, domestic and industrial sectors are competing with agriculture for good quality land and water resources. The demand for food is increasing with the increasing urbanization, shrinking farm size, development in education and migration to cities in search of better livelihoods. More people in India are taking animal-based food while the population on vegetarian diets (which needs almost 1/3rd  water for producing same calories food) is shrinking (Table 1  ). Increased food production has to come from the available, finite and limited water and land resources that are declining in quality and quantity (Wani et al., 2011a , 2011b ). Reduction in the economical and biological productivity of Indian soils through different land degradation processes (e.g., water erosion, wind erosion, soil salinity, soil pollution, etc.) pose a major challenge to agricultural production systems. Land degradation is inherently linked with soil quality (SI 8). In general, soil quality assessments are focused on the determination of soil nutrients (i.e., chemical indicators), which fulfils the agronomic requirements and provides management recommendations. Therefore, several reports are available on how soil nutrient deficiencies influence crop productivity. For instance, widespread deficiencies of Zn, B, and S in addition to known deficiencies of macronutrients such as N and P (Table S5) are apparently holding back the productivity potential (Sahrawat et al., 2007 , 2011 ; Wani et al., 2012 ; Chander et al., 2013a , 2013b , 2014 ) resulting in low crop yields for farmers. Sulphur deficiency in Indian soybean growing areas emerged largely due to a shift from single super phosphate (SSP) to di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) by farmers because of subsidies on nitrogenous fertilisers. Another fallout of the fertilizer subsidy is that farmers have moved away from using organic manure preserving good soil health to chemical fertilizers as a cheap source of nutrients. With land degradation, the deteriorating soil quality is manifested through numerous indicators such as reduction in organic C, evidence of multi-nutrients deficiencies, deterioration of soil physical health, and impairment of biological activities among others (Basak et al., 2016 , 2021b ; Choudhary et al., 2018 ) (Table S6). In general, chemical and physical indicators are straightforward and easy to determine while methods for biological indicators are more cumbersome. However, soil microbes can respond early and rapidly to environmental changes and stresses and it becomes imperative to include them in soil health assessment often even prior to detectable changes in physical or chemical indicators (Lehmann et al., 2020 ). Thus, assessment of soil health should be done keeping in mind the management goals with associated soil functions for different soil types and cropping system followed by screening of relevant soil physical, chemical and biological indicators along with their optimum and threshold value (Table S7). Under intensive cultivation, as occurs in IGP and some other parts of the country, soil quality issues are triggered with the burning of crop residues aggravating C, N and S losses and inflicting heat stress to soil living system (Lohan et al., 2018 ). Rehabilitating and reverting from degradation or regaining its productive state needs time and expensive corrective measures (Basak et al., 2015 ; Mandal et al., 2016 ). These severely degraded soils sometimes even lost their resilience (Mandal, 2013 ) causing a serious dent in the already depleted soil wealth of the Indian nation. A well-focused attention is needed to rehabilitate these soils in the most intensively cultivated areas to strengthen the backbone of national food security. Among the SDGs, goal number 15 is dedicated to “Life on land: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss” (United Nations, 2015 ). To achieve this goal, land degradation neutrality (LDN) is targeted (SI 9).  3.2 Human health and food security Strong relationships exist among soil quality, human health, and ecosystem services (Nieder et al., 2018 ). Almost all the essential plant nutrients are critical to the quality of plant-based food, which serves as the main source of dietary intake for human. In India, the availability or access to food and the nutritional quality of food are cause of concern for the growing population. India is ranked 101 out of 116 countries in the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2021. Though the GHI score has declined to 27.5 (still classified as serious on GHI severity scale), from 38.8 in 2000 yet the situation is far from satisfactory. A comprehensive national nutrition survey (CNNS) involving 112,316 children below 16 years of age conducted during 2016-2018 across 30 states of India revealed that more than 15% of the children between 1-4 years, 5-9 years and 9-16 years showed deficiencies in vitamin A, vitamin B12, vitamin D, folate, and Zn contents (Fig. 4  ). It is estimated that 15.3% of India's population is undernourished and 208.6 million people are suffering from malnutrition accounting for more than 30% of the total malnourished (683.9 million) in the world (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO, 2021 ). Malnutrition and other health conditions in Indian population are because of low dietary intake of nutrients, overeating fats and cereals and poverty. Proteins in different plant products contain about 16% N; Indian soils being inherently low in nitrogen cannot supply the requisite amount for food production. Though the supply is augmented through fertilizer application yet only 14% of the fertilizer N reaches human mouth in a vegetarian diet and only 4% in a non-vegetarian diet (Galloway and Cowling, 2002 ). Dependence of the growing population on cereals, which are not only inherently low in micronutrients but also losing its concentration with progression since the initiation of green revolution compared with many other food crops, leads to micronutrient deficiencies (Debnath et al., 2021 ). This is particularly pronounced in coarse-textured soils with low SOC contents (Benbi and Brar, 1992 ). Soil properties and management conditions pertinent to several regions in India such as high CaCO3  content, alkaline pH and high salt concentration and prolonged flooding as in paddy soils lead to Zn deficiency in plants (Dutta et al., 1989 ; Nieder et al., 2018 ). Besides nutrient deficiencies in food products, the dietary diversity has also declined over the years. For instance, the per capita availability of cereals in India increased from 334.2 g per day in 1951 to 458.0 g per day in 2020 whereas that of the pulses decreased from 60.7 to 43.8 g per day during the same period causing decline in diet diversity (DES, 2020 ). It is well-known that pulses are an important source of proteins and several indispensable amino acids for humans. In addition to carbohydrates and proteins, many of the micronutrients are integral components of minerals and vitamins. Thus, not only overall volume of agricultural produce but also its nutritional value is a key component of supplying balanced diet to human and other animals. Therefore, growing plant nutrient deficiency in Indian soils is a critical concern for maintaining human and animal health. Good soil health is required to ensure the quality of food, and for food and nutritional security. To address malnutrition in India, it is economical and efficient to address food quality issues through soil health and diet diversification rather than through bio-fortification and nutritional amendments externally. Unless the targeted nutrients are available in soil, bio-fortified crop cultivars would end-up in low nutrient contents in targeted areas.   4 Contemporary soil research initiatives There is a greater need today on building preparedness on how to increase productivity in millions of smallholder farms in India without losing soil quality and soil health. Fortunately, soil research and investment in it are rapidly growing in India. There is a growing interest in the assessment of soil processes (Garg et al., 2009 ; Patil et al., 2011 ; Chakraborty and Das, 2018 ), soil quality and soil health indicators (Basak et al., 2021a ), soil characterization through non-invasive sensing (Santra et al., 2009 ; Sarathjith et al., 2014 ; Gupta et al., 2016 ; Das et al., 2015 ; Vasava et al., 2019 ), upscaling to regional-scale hydrologic processes (Santra et al., 2011 ) among others. Soils are increasingly recognized as a key part of the agricultural system in harmony with several factors of productivity and sustainability. Specifically, soil organic C is increasingly recognized as the foundation of soil health and its productivity. Concerted efforts are on to determine critical C content in soils and ways to maintain it tailoring cropping systems and management practices for soils under different AERs. Efforts are also underway to identify master indicators of soil health and their critical limits for different soil types of the country to curb soil degradation and prioritise investment for rehabilitation initiating network and collaborative projects. In the following, we capture a few key areas of contemporary soil research in India that follow international footsteps. 4.1 Nutrient transport and nutrient use efficiency Today, most farmers in India grow high-yielding varieties, which generally require large quantities of plant nutrients. Consequently, major nutrients are applied in large quantities and there is an increasing trend to apply micronutrients for ensuring high yield. Unfortunately, the use efficiencies for plant nutrients continue to be low. Consequently, much of the unused nutrients enter into different water bodies causing eutrophication and other environmental problems. Typically, nutrients are applied in form of fertilizers and composts based on the nutrient status of soils as determined from a soil test report. Such an approach does not account for processes that transport nutrients out of root zone. In fact, soluble nutrients such as N may rapidly get transported from the root zone and may not be available for plant uptake making use efficiency very low. Thus, the transport processes may indeed play a vital role in determining nutrient status in soil, which when incorporated into the management plan may improve nutrient use efficiency substantially. A series of pioneering research on nutrient transport through soil columns in 1970s (Cho, 1971 ; Misra et al., 1974 ) illustrated how mathematical solutions may be used to describe nutrient movement and simultaneous oxidation of NH4 +  to NO3 ‐  and reduction of NO3 ‐  to elemental N in saturated and unsaturated soils. Subsequent nutrient transport studies evaluated nitrate transport in field-scale leaching experiments (Misra and Mishra, 1977 ; Mishra and Misra, 1991 ), temperature dependency of NO3 ‐  reduction (Mangaraja and Misra, 1978 ), P transport and retention (Panda et al., 1978 ), transport of coated and uncoated fertilizers in soils showing nonequilibrium conditions (Patil et al., 2010 , 2013 ), and more recently K transport (Shekhar et al., 2021 ). Many of these studies clearly demonstrate that much of the added nutrients are lost during transport through the soil. For example, Patil et al. (2010)  demonstrated that the N use efficiencies may be doubled if flow and transport processes are accounted for. These studies clearly call for more research on nutrient transport through Indian soils, specifically because of the presence of high proportion of coarse textured soils that facilitates rapid transport processes.  4.2 Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy for soil assessment Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) over the visible to near-infrared (wavelength range: 350-2500 nm) region (VNIR) continues to emerge as an alternative to conventional laboratory methods of estimating several soil properties (Ben-Dor and Banin, 1995 ; van der Meer, 2018 ). The DRS approach is attractive because it is rapid, eco-friendly, non-invasive and DRS data may be collected using both proximal sensors and those onboard remote sensing platforms. Recently, Singh et al. (2019)  have shown that the DRS- and the wet chemistry-based soil testing approaches lead to similar nutrient recommendations for cocoa cultivation. This is a critical finding in favor of complimenting wet chemistry approach with the DRS approach of soil testing although studies also suggest that the accuracy of the DRS technology needs improvement. Another advantage of the VNIR technology is the remote sensing capability to deploy these sensors in the airborne and satellite platforms and acquire hyperspectral imagery for quantitative soil surface property mapping (Sahoo, 2022 ). For example, studies of quantitative soil texture mapping using hyperspectral data provided more accurate predictions (Ben-Dor et al., 2002 ; Stevens et al., 2010 ) than those using multispectral data (Vaudour et al., 2019 ). With the successful launch of the Sentinel-2 satellites, the Copernicus program has provided global coverage of terrestrial surfaces with multispectral images, with a revisit time of five days since 2017 (Demattê et al., 2016 ). Efforts have been made in India for soil spectral library generation (Saxena et al., 2003 ; Srivastava et al., 2004 ; Singh et al., 2014 ). Over the last decade, a few laboratories in India have aggressively used the DRS approach to extend its capability beyond routine soil analysis. A series of recent studies from India has shown that the DRS approach may be used for soil hydraulic properties (Santra et al., 2009 ), aggregate size distribution parameters (Sarathjith et al., 2014 ), compost quality (Chakraborty et al., 2014 ), weathering indices (Mohanty et al., 2016 ), Atterberg limits (Gupta et al., 2016 ), arsenic content (Chakraborty et al., 2017 ), matric potential of soil (Panigrahi and Das, 2018 ), and soil texture (Vasava et al., 2019 ) among others. Studies have also shown that the DRS approach may be used for routine soil analysis (Santra et al., 2015 ; Sarathjith et al., 2016 ; Mahajan et al., 2021 ). Recently, Hati et al. (2022)  used the DRS approach to estimate multiple soil properties using spectral reflectance data over the mid-infrared region. In addition to such proximal soil sensing approaches, multispectral remote sensing data are used for estimating soil properties (Setia et al., 2013 ; Swain et al., 2021 ). In addition, efforts have also been made to estimate soil properties (Divya et al., 2014 ) and several crop canopy parameters (Mahajan et al., 2021 ; Das et al., 2021 ) using hyperspectral remote sensing approach. Detailed reviews on the status and future prospects of hyperspectral sensing approach for soil resource assessment have also been reported by Das et al. (2015)  and Goswami et al. (2020) .  4.3 Critical zone framework and geospatial technologies Research on addressing the mechanistic processes of soil functions and their quantitative representation in mathematical and computation models are being identified as major global challenges of critical zone resource provisioning for human benefit. Emerging geospatial and remote sensing technologies, smart sensing approaches and rapid expansion of agricultural start-up ecosystems are being perceived to produce viable solutions to nagging issues of yield stagnation and environmental degradation. The integrated study of small watersheds is one of the best ways to analyse soils in the critical zone, which is getting widely applied using the critical zone observatories (CZO) set up globally (White et al., 1998 ; Gaillardet et al., 2018 ). In India, studies are being carried out in the Kabini critical zone observatory (CZO) in Southern India with an aim to answer the role of major parameters (relief, climate, soil, lithology, vegetation, anthropisation, etc.) in bio-geochemical and hydrological cycles related to the tropics, especially, under semi-humid climate (Braun et al., 2005 ; Sekhar et al., 2016 ). The Western Ghats in southern India runs parallel to the western coast of the peninsula forming an orographic barrier and inducing a strong climatic gradient of about one order of magnitude rainfall in 100 km (Pascal, 1982 ) This is associated with changes in landscape geomorphology (Gunnell, 2000 ) and resulting red soils and black soil is widespread on the semi-humid to semiarid area of the Deccan plateau (Gunnell and Bourgeon, 1997 ). It was inferred that the climatic and pedoclimatic conditions are decisive in the formation of red soils (Alfisols), whereas the formation of black soils (Vertisols) depends mainly on the slowdown of the solution and lack of drainage usually in the bottom part of the landscape. Using one of the first datasets of Kabini CZO, Barbiero et al. (2007)  presented the distribution and dynamics of a widespread red soil (Oxisols and Chromic Alfisols) and black soil (Vertisols and Vertic intergrades) cover and the results indicated that both topography and lithology (gneiss and amphibolite) have influenced the distribution of the soils. They further investigated the possible relationship with the recent development of the erosion process and have identified the distinctive types of erosional landforms. The CZO framework requires soil, crop and hydrologic data at larger than agricultural farm scales. Efforts on utilizing geospatial and remote sensing technologies have resulted in a first-of-kind information for the Kabini CZO. For instance, Gomez et al. (2019)  analysed Sentinel-2 time-series images for soil texture classification in terms of accuracy and uncertainty estimation of the Oxisols and Vertisols covering the watersheds of the Kabini CZO. Their study explored classification of four soil texture classes (clay, sandy loam, sandy clay and sandy clay loam) in the study site using remote sensing approach. The uncertainty analysis carried out by Gomez et al. (2019)  showed that the clay and sandy loam were more certain than classifications of intermediate classes i.e. sandy clay and sandy clay loam. Good estimates of soil hydraulic parameters and their distribution in a catchment is essential for crop-hydrology models. Measurements of soil properties by experimental methods are expensive and often time consuming, and in order to account for spatial variability of these parameters in the catchment, it becomes necessary to conduct a large number of measurements. Although extensive soil data is becoming more and more available at various scales in the form of digital soil maps (Lagacherie, 2008 ) there is still a large gap between this available information and the input parameters needed for hydrological models (Lin, 2012 ). Inverse modelling has been extensively used but the spatial variability of the parameters and insufficient datasets restricts its applicability at the catchment scale. Santra et al. (2009)  showed that reflectance spectroscopy may be used to estimate soil hydraulic properties (water retention and hydraulic conductivity). Montzka et al. (2011)  demonstrated the possibility of estimating the soil hydraulic parameters using remotely-sensed surface soil water content measurements by applying a sequential filtering technique to the mechanistic soil-water model HYDRUS 1-D. Since soil water content retrieved from remote sensing is representative of the top 5 cm only, inversion of models using surface soil water content cannot give good estimates of soil properties of deeper layers. Crop biophysical parameters such as leaf area index (LAI) and above ground biomass on the other hand are sensitive to the properties of the root zone soil and hence these observations can be useful for estimating the properties of deeper soil layers. Leaf area index and biomass can be estimated from optical/microwave remote sensing data. Estimation of multi-layered soil hydraulic properties were aptly demonstrated through inversion of crop model STICS with inputs of observed surface soil water content and crop canopy information (Sreelash et al., 2017 ). A large number of studies are directed towards using satellite data, especially in microwave domain for retrieval of soil water content and hydraulic parameters (Tomer et al., 2016 ; Zribi et al., 2019 ) (SI 10; Figs. S5 and S6). The challenges of tackling food and water security, addressing sustainable land management and mitigating and adapting to the impacts of climate change will promote further research on integrated studies of soil functions and their connection to wider critical zone processes with improved field measurements through innovations in sensors and satellite/ UAV data products (e.g. thermal infrared bands), it will offer opportunities for the use of newer data science and computational tools (e.g. AI/ ML, big data, HPC computing) and will drive development of a new generation of soil models that will systematically include all necessary physical, chemical, and biological processes.   5 Connecting farmers with soil research 5.1 Government initiatives Agricultural research, development and extension in India have grown since independence under the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare with three constituent departments: Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW), Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying & Fisheries (DAHD&F) and Department of Agricultural Research and Education (DARE). The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) under DARE is the nodal organization spearheading agricultural research through a network of 71 state agricultural universities, 111 ICAR Institutes, and 731 Krishi Vigyan Kendras  across the country. From the very inception of green revolution, the ICAR has popularized the STCR concepts and yield goal research by initiating the All India Coordinated Research Project (AICRP) on STCR as early as 1967-68 to build a balance between crop productivity and farmers’ profitability while sustaining soil quality. Similarly, the All India Coordinated Scheme of Micronutrients in Soils and Plants was established during 1967 with six centres and the project was expanded in terms of mandate and spread of centres (Shukla and Behera, 2019 ). The ICAR also has focused on technology transfer through KVKs, Lab-to-Land Programme, the National Agricultural Research Project (NARP), Institution-Village Linkage Programme (IVLP) among others. In addition to several such research and development projects under the ICAR, the DAC&FW has launched the national SHC scheme in 2015 to provide nutrient status and fertilizer recommendations based on soil test values to farmers. The SHC scheme recommends collection of geo-referenced soil samples in a grid of 2.5 ha (irrigated) and 10 ha (rain-fed) covering around 30 million farms each year. Although SHCs do not include physical and biological attributes of soils for evaluating soil degradation processes, SHCs are connecting millions of farmers with decades of STCR-based soil research.  5.2 Participatory research by other organizations In addition to national efforts, international organizations such as ICRISAT are also engaged in transferring soil research to farmers’ fields. Recognizing that 51% farmers in India do not get any extension support and the current government set-up is able to reach only 11% of the farmers (NSSO, 2013 ), ICRISAT implemented large scaling-up projects such as Bhoochetana, Bhoosamruddhi, Rythu kosam  in states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and several corporate social responsibility (CSR) projects across India (Sahrawat et al., 2008 ; Sahrawat and Wani, 2013 ) to demonstrate that STCR-based nutrient application may be ultimately profitable to farmers while putting limited pressure on soil. Detailed stratified and participatory soil sampling was undertaken in Karnataka in 2009 under the Bhoochetana  initiative and soil samples from 92,864 farmers’ fields were collected from 4699 villages covering 30 districts. Detailed analysis of farmers’ field soil samples revealed that deficiency of macro-, secondary- and micro-nutrients varied a lot amongst the districts. For example, deficiency across 30 districts varied from 0 to 78% for N (using organic C as criterion), 5 to 97% for P, 1 to 68% for K, 2 to 92% for S, 24 to 92 for Zn, and 34 to 91% for B (Wani et al., 2012 ). Soil atlas was prepared for the state of Karnataka for the first time (Wani et al., 2011b ). This indicated that the current way of recommending fertiliser doses at state level for irrigated and dryland crops does not work and there is a need to develop recommendations at village/taluk  level. Similar variability amongst the districts was also observed in Andhra Pradesh across 13 districts after analysing 36,632 soil samples from farmers’ fields. The recommendations were developed using the rule, if > 50% of farmers’ fields were deficient then full dose was recommended, for more than 25 to 50% deficient fields half of recommended dose and less than 25% deficient fields in the village 1/4th  of recommended dose as a maintenance dose of a particular nutrient was recommended. Soil analysis results and fertiliser recommendations were disseminated amongst the farmers using wall writings, soil health cards and through farmer facilitators (FFs- para extension workers) in each village. Using a participatory demonstration approach, the soil test-based balanced fertiliser application approach (or the improved practice, IP) was compared with the existing farmer's practices (FP) originally followed in the locality for growing a selected crop. The FFs and lead farmers guided the farmers to conduct demonstrations and through regular monitoring, observations were recorded for both the treatments using randomly selected and labelled plants from each treatment. Field days were conducted to disseminate the results where farmers explained the interventions and explained the results and discussed with the farmers from the neighbouring villages. Randomly selected farmers’ fields were used for crop cutting data recording in presence of the committee members (Wani et al., 2021 ). Balanced nutrient management recommendations based on stratified soil analysis benefitted millions of farmers in India with increased incomes and productivity (Wani et al., 2021 ) through scaling-up strategy adopted. Response to improved management practice (IP) of balanced nutrient treatments varied with crops, states and districts (Wani et al., 2021 ). For example, maximum increase in kharif  sorghum yield with balanced nutrient management in Telangana state was 118%, in Karnataka it was 30%, for soybean in Madhya Pradesh it was 34%, for groundnut in Karnataka it was 27%, in Telangana it was 102%, in Rajasthan it was 14%, in Andhra Pradesh it was 33% over the crop yield in farmers’ practice (Fig. 5  ). Similar variation in response to crops was observed for rabi  crops also. Castor responded well (64% in Telangana, 61% in Karnataka) over the farmers’ practice. All crops responded to balanced nutrient management and minimum increase in yield was recorded 10% over the farmers’ practice. Similarly, benefits in a collaborative scaling-up project between CRIDA and ICRISAT in tribal and backward districts of Andhra Pradesh (undivided) were also recorded with balanced nutrient management (Srinivasa Rao et al., 2011 ). Increased rainwater use efficiency (RUE) with balanced nutrient application increased crop yields and profitability for farmers. Highest RUE was observed in case of INM treatments, followed by balanced nutrient management and least was in farmers’ practice (Table 2  ). Response to balanced nutrient management varied with seasons largely due to rainfall. INM involving 50% N through vermicompost showed highest returns and RUE indicating the need to adopt INM strategy for enhancing productivity, profitability and sustainability. In Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan several trials conducted with balanced nutrition for enhancing WUE (productivity and profitability) through the GoI's program “More crop per drop”  demonstrated increased crop yields by 14 to 33% with balanced nutrient management along with increased benefit: cost ratios 1.6 to 10 as compared to 1.2 to 9 in case of farmers ‘practice.   6 Trends in soil science education in India Following a detailed assessment report on the state of Indian Agriculture by John Augustus Voelcker in 1893 (Reijntjes, 1992 ), the Imperial Agricultural Research Institute was setup in 1905 in Pusa, Darbhanga (now Samastipur) district of Bihar, which was later shifted to New Delhi and renamed as the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) in 1935. Subsequently, the creation of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and state agricultural universities played a critical role in spearheading Green Revolution in India. Over almost a century, most of soil research focused on soil fertility. Although food grain production increased over four-fold since independence and soil science is intimately associated with agronomy, forestry, and environmental science (Sharma and Aulakh, 2009 ), high NPK addition has now created second generation issues in terms of soil salinity and deterioration of soil and water quality in many parts of India where Green Revolution was very successful. Second, rain-fed agriculture was bypassed during the Green Revolution resulting in large yield gaps. Although fertilisers played an important role during Green Revolution, many farmers could not harness the benefits of soil science as scientists always talked about large numbers of samples to be analysed for getting representative analysis. Soil scientists also worked in isolation resulting in providing compartmental solutions to the farmers who were looking for holistic solutions ultimately leading to poor adoption of developed technologies. In turn, a vicious negative feedback cycle of low adoption was initiated leading into poor employment opportunities for soil science graduates and low preference by the students for soil science discipline. As reported by Sharma and Aulakh (2009) , the number of students opting for soil science is reducing over the period, we need to change syllabus suitably considering the current trends and improve employability of soil science students. A resurgence is obviously urgently needed in India to attract best minds into soil science education and research. It is essential to establish ‘soil science’ as a pillar of ‘natural resource management’ and ‘environmental science’ and not being treated as a separate discipline (Sharma and Aulakh, 2009 ). There is also a need to strengthen soil science education and research by addressing global issues related to climate change, water and soil quality, biodiversity, disaster management, and erosion and desertification (Lal, 2007 ). Specifically, engaging with different stakeholders will reshape the future of soil science education and research.  7 Preparedness for meeting SDGs With the UN declaration of 2015 as the international year of soils, we recognize the connection between soils and SDGs. Fortunately, several national efforts are underway. For instance, the current efforts of SHC Mission, more crop per drop of water, carbon sequestration, and doubling of farmers’ income are expected to generate holistic solutions. The emphasis must be on providing demand-driven solutions to farmers with economic benefits while protecting our environment. Researchers must work with policy makers, extension staff, and farmers to highlight the benefits of soil science. Although fertility remains a crucial issue, soil science research should also explore and improve the use of organic fertilisers. We need to popularise INM and convince farmers that only organic or zero budget strategies will not feed the 1.34 billion population. The onus is on research managers to liaise with the policy makers, extension staff, and farmers and demonstrate the benefits of INM holistically to meet the SDGs. Under the NITI Aayog, Government of India has constituted the Development Monitoring and Evaluation Office (DMEO) for monitoring and implementing the SDGs. An SDG India Index was launched in 2018 to monitor the progress of the implementation of SDGs made by the states and union territories (UT) in the country. Recently, a third edition of the SDG India Index was released for 2020-2021 (NITI Aayog, 2021 ). The index provides goal scores ranging from 0-100 with the high goal score being the distance a state or UT has reached towards the targets set for 2030. Based on the scores, states and UTs are classified into four different categories: Aspirant (0-49), Performer (50-64), Front Runner (65-99) and Achiever (100). A composite score is calculated for each state and UT by taking the mean of the individual goal scores. The state of Kerala tops in the country with a composite SDG score of 75 followed by 74 for Himachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. For the SDG2 (End Hunger, Achieve Food Security and Improved Nutrition, and Promote Sustainable Agriculture, United Nations, 2015 ), the national score was 47 in 2020, which is low. Specifically, eleven states and two UTs fall behind the country's score of 47 making it difficult to achieve its target by 2030. In case of food subsidy, the country has covered 99.51 % of beneficiaries under National Food Security Act 2013 in 2019-20 (NITI Aayog, 2021 ). The target 2.2 of SDG2 aims at ending all forms of malnutrition. As per the CNNS Report 2016-18, 33.4% of children under five years are underweight and the target has been set to reduce it to 1.9%. The target 2.3 of SDG2 aims to double the productivity of rice and wheat to 5322.08 kg/ha by 2030, from the base year of 2015-2016. Only Punjab and Haryana are nearing the target with productivity of 4693.24 kg/ha for rice and 4272.42 kg/ha for wheat in 2018-2019 (NITI Aayog, 2021 ). Creating national-scale SDG indicators and building national SHC mission indicate both preparedness and focus in addressing the deterioration of soil health and land degradation in the country. Efforts to end hunger have reverberated in our national goal to double farm income. The action plan on doubling farmers’ income led by the NITI Aayog  (National Institution for Transforming India) put forth four strategies for growth in output and income of farmers: (i) development initiative including infrastructure, (ii) technology, (iii) policy, and (iv) institutional mechanisms (Chand, 2017 ). The first action plan involves the adoption of development initiatives, which support farmers and related stakeholders to invest in agriculture sector through the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana  (PMKSY), Prampragat Krishi Vikas Yojana  (PKVY), Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana  (PMFBY), etc. The second action plan focuses on developing transformative technologies for improving agricultural productivity (e.g., sensor-based applications, genetically modified crops, etc.). The third action plan revolves around the creation of competitive markets, ensuring minimum support prices, liberalization, deregulation and removal of excessive control and restrictions on private sector, etc. The fourth action plan involves in the creation of organization of farmers through institutional mechanisms for better marketing of outputs such as farmers producing organization (FPOs) and self-help groups (SHGs). These initiatives are expected to establish a close connection between farmers and soil research to forge food security while ensuring sustainability of our soil as a national capital.  8 Summary and outlook The greatest challenge for a populous country such as India is to secure food, nutrition, livelihoods, clean water, and sanitation from much of its already degrading land and water resources. Here, we capture existing and developing soil-human linkages in soil research and their role in meeting the SDGs. We began by taking a stock of Indian soils, their quality and nutrient status and explored some of the rapidly emerging areas of soil research to realize this goal. India has 11 major soil groups with more than 72% of its 329 Mha geographical area covered by alluvial, red, and black soils. As many as 8 different soil orders are found in our country. Measured soil parameters across the country at 1:250000 scale suggest that the first and third quartiles range from 18 to 54% for sand contents, 22 to 48% for clay contents, 5.8 to 7.9 for soil pH, and 0.20 to 0.66% for SOC contents. In general, the SOC stock for Indian soils is low and low CEC values coupled with low water holding capacities make Indian soils to have poor soil quality. Some of the strategies to build SOC stock includes the addition of FYM or other green manures, inclusion of legume-based cropping systems, growing of horticultural crops, improved cultivation practices such as zero tillage, and addition of crop residues among others. Continuous addition of micronutrient-free NPK fertilizers and indiscriminate use of irrigation water during the post-green revolution period have caused micronutrient and secondary nutrient deficiencies in many Indian soils. Large scale soil testing efforts in farmers’ fields in 12 different Indian states revealed that almost 74% of agricultural soils require soil amendments. In fact, major focus on NPK application by farmers without adequate soil testing has created nutrient imbalance in many agricultural fields resulting in decreasing use efficiencies for major plant nutrients. The ability of soils to support soil functions or services is decreasing, thereby, creating large yield gaps between the achievable potential and farmers’ harvested yields. Unless the targeted nutrients are available in soil, even the bio-fortified crop cultivars will have low nutrient contents adversely affecting human and animal health. Thus, there is an urgent need to reverse this land degradation trend. Fortunately, there are national strategies being developed to double farmers’ income by focusing on development initiatives including infrastructure, technology, policy, and institutional mechanisms (Chand, 2017 ). Specifically, the government has launched key development programmes to support farmers and related stakeholders such as Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana  (PMKSY), Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana  (PKVY), Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana  (PMFBY), and soil health card mission to strengthen irrigation, traditional agriculture, crop insurance, and soil testing, respectively. The doubling farm income committee has recommended seven action plans to increase farm income in India: (i) increase in productivity of crops, (ii) increase in productivity of livestock (iii) improvement in efficiency of input use (cost saving), (iv) increase in crop intensity, (v) diversification towards high value crops (vi) improved price realization by farmers and (viii) shift of cultivation to non-farm jobs (DFI, 2017 ). There is also a call for developing transformative technologies such as sensor-based assessment of soil parameters and soil processes. Fortunately, soil research on nutrient transport, DRS, DSM, different remote sensing methods, and modelling of agricultural systems in critical zone framework has already been initiated over the last two decades. While these new research areas should be strengthened, there is also a need for strengthening the knowledge delivery system using innovative methods such as para-extension workers (lead farmers and farm facilitators), new IT tools like apps, decision support systems in local languages to reach to a large number of small farm-holders. There is also a need to build partnerships amongst researchers, policy makers, and development workers including extension agents, small farm-holders and inputs suppliers. Thus, we emphasize that soil research must focus both on technology development and implementation such that technology remains relevant to farmers.
