                  Challenges of high energy efficiency, water saving, low-carbon emissions, waste management and food saving have been considerable pressures on both regional and global sustainable development. This paper reviews the water-energy extended nexuses (e.g. food, greenhouse gases, waste, pollution, land and others) from the perspective of relationship and practicability in relieving the challenges towards environmentally-related sustainable development goals. A specific issue identified is that with the popularity of “nexus” and extension beyond resources nexus, the positioning and identity of nexuses become ambiguous. In most cases, nexus is a more attractively sounding term to replace specific expressions such as multi-criteria optimisation, trade-offs, correlation/relationship, input-output assessment, material flow analysis, and integrated design. The methodologies (e.g. input-output analysis and life cycle assessment) entail needing to be adequately integrated or expanded for diverse water-energy extended nexuses. It is crucial for evaluating resource flows in multiple regions and sectors and assessing the associated environment-economic impacts. A standardised understanding like establishing life cycle assessment and even more quantified footprints could ensure that the nexus would not fall as the group of a buzzword and contribute to sustainable development goals. This study serves as a stepping stone to establish quantified characteristics or components as eligibility to classify as nexus approaches and studies.

Challenges of high energy efficiency, water saving, low-carbon emissions, waste management and food saving have been considerable pressures on both regional and global sustainable development. This paper reviews the water-energy extended nexuses (e.g. food, greenhouse gases, waste, pollution, land and others) from the perspective of relationship and practicability in relieving the challenges towards environmentally-related sustainable development goals. A specific issue identified is that with the popularity of “nexus” and extension beyond resources nexus, the positioning and identity of nexuses become ambiguous. In most cases, nexus is a more attractively sounding term to replace specific expressions such as multi-criteria optimisation, trade-offs, correlation/relationship, input-output assessment, material flow analysis, and integrated design. The methodologies (e.g. input-output analysis and life cycle assessment) entail needing to be adequately integrated or expanded for diverse water-energy extended nexuses. It is crucial for evaluating resource flows in multiple regions and sectors and assessing the associated environment-economic impacts. A standardised understanding like establishing life cycle assessment and even more quantified footprints could ensure that the nexus would not fall as the group of a buzzword and contribute to sustainable development goals. This study serves as a stepping stone to establish quantified characteristics or components as eligibility to classify as nexus approaches and studies.

It is an approach to environmental resources management assessing the interrelatedness and interdependencies and their transitions and fluxes across spatial scales and between compartments [1 ]. The nexus thinking is suggested to improve resource security by integrating management and governance across sectors and scales, reducing trade-offs, and building synergies. The 17 SDGs by United Nations [2 ] encompass of economic, social and environmental dimensions. It is operationalised through 169 targets and 232 indicators [3 ]. Based on the summary by Ref. [4 ], more than half of the SDGs have an environmental focus and include at least one target concerning environmental sustainability. The progress towards achieving the environmental dimension of the SDGs has been recently evaluated [5 ], while only 22% of the 93 environment-related indicators are on track to meet the target. The other 78% of indicators are either not progressing or without sufficient data for evaluation. The important question is to find answers to why this is happening? The needs to scale up environmental action and improve monitoring and analysis have been continuously highlighted, including creating transparent methodologies. Fig. 1   summarises the number of environment-related indicators of 17 SDGs. Other than SDG10 (i.e. reduced inequalities), all goals are directly or indirectly related to environmental sustainability. The Circular Economy (CE) model [6 ] is one of the strategies in achieving environmental-related SDGs. It has received great attention from researchers and policymakers. The earlier CE models focus on waste management, mainly recycling and reuse. The current common aim is to use resources efficiently and for the longest possible time, beyond waste management, including improved design (redesign) and materials management (refrain, reduce) [7 ]. However, as for SDGs, the establishment of clear methodologies in measuring and assessing remains a challenge. It is important to inform the progress and further development and improvement, as emphasis via “you can't manage what you don't measure” by Drucker [8 ]. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a methodology for assessing the performance associated with all life cycle stages, including environmental, economic and social aspects [9 ]. It is relatively recognised, however, how the stages, e.g. the system boundaries, are taken into account could impact the results. One of the issues is understanding resource interdependencies in delivering SDGs; in another common description, the nexus. The evaluation of critical interlinkages across different actors (e.g. resources), is vital for a representative quantification/result. However, how to put this nexus thinking to practice with the support of consistent methodology still deserves more development. Among the different resources, water and energy are some of the combinations showing a substantial nexus [10 ]. Numerous research studies have assessed the associated synergies either from a macro [11 ] or micro-level [12 ]. Various review studies are conducted to provide the foundation of knowledge on the water-energy nexus, discuss apparent contradictions, establish a consensus and identify future research. Dai et al. [13 ] reviewed 70 tools and methods on water-energy nexus for macro-assessment. It was summarised that approaches designed to support governance need further development, including a better classification and understanding of the strengths and weaknesses, to impact policy and management significantly. Ding et al. [14 ] examined the origin, development and prospect of water-energy nexus from 2007 to 2019, highlighting the importance of nexus research from microsystems. Fan et al. [15 ] presented a review on water-energy nexus from the perspective of urban metabolism and suggesting water-energy nexus is a starting point where a broader set of resource interactions should be further developed. Ahmad et al. [16 ], on the other hand, discussed the water-energy nexus for urban water systems. A similar review has been previously conducted by Lee et al. [17 ] for urban water systems, however, its focus on the relation to global water risks. The approaches of water-energy nexus in optimising water supply system has also been reviewed by Vakilifard et al. [18 ]. Review studies are essential in putting pieces together, owing to the rapid development and vast assessments. This is especially the case when the nexus methodology still needs an extension to be well established. Meng et al. [19 ] suggested that energy-water nexus is a mainstream topic. The studies assessing trade-offs amongst three aspects as an integrated system, energy-water extended nexus, are still in their infancy. The Water-Energy-Food (WEF) nexus is amongst the most reviewed and established extension [20 ]. Endo et al. [21 ] evaluated the methodology for the energy-water-food nexus and highlighted transferability (geographically), and scalability remains a challenge. Del Borghi et al. [22 ], on the other hand, suggested the nexus as a concept is clear but how to convert the theoretical framework into an integrated approach and policy is still an ongoing topic. Some of the modelling approaches which could use for dynamic decision making, serving as guidelines for policymakers, include mathematical optimisation, agent-based modelling and game theory [23 ]. The other tools include climate, land-use energy water, the water, energy, food nexus tool 2.0, MARKAL/TIMES, Water Evaluation and Planning System (WEAP), and Multi-Scale Integrated Analysis of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism (MUSIASEM) flow-fund model [24 ]. However, are these nexus specific tools or general modelling tools replaced with a more attractively sounding term, as well as the inconsistency in defining nexus methodology, required further evaluation. Another water-energy extended nexus which have been received increasing high research attention is the water-energy-carbon (WEC) nexus. The review of energy-carbon-water nexus by Li et al. [25 ] suggested the related measures could contribute to co-benefits such as economic growth, pollution reduction as well as water quality improvement. A more specific review on water-energy-GHG, conducted by Zahraee et al. [26 ], focuses on the bioenergy supply and production system. The nexus reviews on the other aspects, e.g. land [27 ], waste [28 ], pollution [24 ] or up to four components (e.g. material-energy-water-carbon nexus by Elshkaki [29 ]) is comparatively less found. Different nexus and direct relationships to SDG has been categorised by Liu et al. [30 ]. The review study has emphasised the methods used in food-energy-water nexus qualification and the need for strong partnerships amongst science, government, the industry, and the citizen. Fader et al. [31 ] assessed the synergies between water (SDG6), energy (SDG7) and food (SDG2). SDG targets and SDG are identified as having the highest number of potential synergies. It suggests the achieving the water targets would contribute considerably to the other SDGs. A perspective paper by Bleischwitz et al. [32 ] illustrated the interlinkages across resource and the SGDs, specifically SDG2, SDG6, SDG7, SDG11, SDG12, SDG13, SDG14 and SDG15. Nexus research is highlighted as an imperative actor for an integrated and efficient implementation of SDGs. It is important to understand the unexpected consequences in achieving different SDGs, and integrated planning should be promoted. Most of the review studies evaluated the extended nexus individually. An integrated discussion under one umbrella could provide a different insight into nexus development using the same lens to view the problem that exists at different scales/levels. This study aims to comprehensively review the Water-Energy Extended nexuses, where the relationship to the environmental-related SDGs is analysed. The novel contributions include:i. Overview of a broader range of water-energy extended nexuses, including food, climate, waste, pollution, land and the others relatively new nexus.  ii. Consideration of nexus thinking at both macro and micro level towards environmental-related SDGs, highlighting the potential of nexus being a buzzword.  ii. Recommendation of future research to improve the development of nexus, particularly in term of methodology, to better promote the progress of SDGs.     2 Environmental related nexus thinking This section presents water-energy (WE) extended nexuses, as shown in Fig. 2   generated by the authors, based on the basic WE nexus (Section 2.1 ). They mainly include the water-energy-food (WEF) nexus, water-energy-climate/carbon (WEC) nexus, water-energy-waste (WEW) nexus, water-energy-pollution (WEP) nexus and water-energy-land (WEL) nexus, which are reviewed in Sections 2.2 to 2.6 . The nexus thinking has been applied across many fields; Section 2.7  overviews water-energy + others (WE++) nexuses. The WEF, WEC, WEW, WEP and WEL have coupling relations rather than exist independently. The complicated relationship has been discussed sporadically in Sections 2.2 to 2 .7. 2.1 Water-energy (WE) The WE nexus has been drawing increasing attention from both scientific and policy communities for years, especially over the past decade. The research on this topic has acknowledged a significant rise in the number and quality of relevant studies and the productive exploration of the linkages within WE and even in the broader system and at a much higher resolution [13 ]. Water and energy are profoundly entwined in different sectors, economic activities, and social measures. Water withdraws, treatment, and distributions usually consume a massive amount of energy at a basic level, and meanwhile, the power generation significantly demands water (Fig. 3  ). WE nexus occurs in sets of linked economic or productive processes from the supply chain perspective, including production, distribution and consumption. The acknowledgement of the nexus has been increasing worldwide, along with the rising environmental issues, including water scarcity, energy risk, and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. The WE nexus has been a perspective candidate for implementations of Water and Energy Footprints, and a possible implementation tool can be EcoTotal Site Integration [33 ]. As shown in Fig. 4   developed by the authors, it is undoubtedly based on the previous studies that the WE nexus is multidimensional in terms of nature or mechanism, which can involve dimensions of environment, technology, economy, policy and society [34 ]. Those dimensions closely linked to and affect each other, either friendly or antagonistically. The themes extended based on WE significantly vary from conceptualisation to different case studies. Many of them are coupled with other different kinds of term, like food and emissions [35 ], and under the context of climate change [36 ], environmental impacts [37 ], ecosystem services [38 ], and resource distributions [39 ]. Scales of the studies also change widely from micro to macro levels from different perspectives, including different specific topics focused, and the size of cases employed from city to regional and extension to national and global scales. A clear understanding of the nature of the WE nexus is crucial to mitigate the water scarcity and energy risk based on a more comprehensive background. Existing research offers an increasingly clear understanding of the WE nexus. It is clear that more comprehensive nexus frameworks, namely WE extended nexus in this study, are demanded to extend the WE network and integrating with more various terms, such as food, climate, waste, pollution, land and nitrogen.  2.2 Water-energy-food (WEF) The Bonn 2011 Conference titled “The Water, Energy, and Food Security Nexus– Solutions for the Green Economy” [40 ] propelled the WEF nexus approach into international discussions on sustainable development and officially recognised the importance of the nexus pillars [41 ]. The dynamic interlinkages amongst them are manifested as trade-offs, and potential conflicts during production, consumption and management that constraints for one sector may restrict the availability of others consequently [42 ], i.e. food production is limited by the supply of water and energy. While water withdrawal, treatment and reallocation require energy inputs, and energy supply is supported by freshwater withdrawals [43 ]. Besides, they can affect in other forms. For example, food can affect the WEF nexus through trade, etc. Various WEF nexus-related research initiatives and projects have been held worldwide in the past decades, as shown by Fig. 5  . Several scholars pointed out that the challenges in balancing the WEF elements can be exacerbated by resources scarcities, climate change risks, and other environmental impacts. Solutions implemented parts of the WEF nexus without considering its interlinkages may result in unintended consequences [42 ]. The nexus systems should be approached from a holistic and integrated perspective by increasing efficiency, reducing trade-offs, establishing synergies and improving governance across the three sectors co-ordinately [45 ]. Some publications focus on clarifying the concept of the WEF nexus and establishing the conceptual framework to analyse the interactions amongst the three interdependent sectors qualitatively. As the pioneering conceiver of the WEF nexus, the World Economic Forum noted the inseparable linkages amongst the three elements from a security perspective [46 ]. Similarly, Hoff et al. suggested that the WEF nexus has been originally labelled as a security concern; it offers a governance pathway to ensure resource security and deal with resource scarcity [45 ]. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations extended the definition of the WEF nexus by emphasising the importance of incorporating stakeholders into resource use and management [47 ]. Some researchers consider that the WEF nexus is aimed at predicting and protecting against the potential resource insecurity in the future [48 ], yet security should not the only important variable, and the essence of resource crisis rooted in its uneven distribution is overlooked [49 ]. In addition, different versions have developed with arguments over the core component of nexus after the proposal of the WEF nexus in Bonn conference [50 ], i.e. FAO highlighted the central position of food security from transport, final consumers, and waste and sewage management [51 ], and through its interactions with other sectors to guarantee the sustainability of the integrated system [47 ]. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IREN) put forward the energy-oriented approach and noted that renewable energy technologies could address some trade-offs amongst sectors and bring substantial profits [52 ]. In summary, nexus is an open concept instead of a fixed one. It can vary significantly interpreted by researchers’ objects and perspectives, as well as research approaches and scales. In some cases, the water, food, and energy impacts are separate or weakly linked within a framework [53 ]. Currently, when it comes to the application, implementation, and policy of the WEF nexus approaches, they are still immature. For example, the FAO argued that there is a dearth of the WEF nexus adoption in national programmes, policies, and institutions, and the index of gender tends to be neglected in assessments [54 ]. Preliminary achievements have been achieved regarding the model-based quantification of nexus trade-offs and synergies under the social-environmental influences, as well as identification of strategies for cross-sectoral management. Those publications focus on various objectives from the micro to the macro level with different system boundaries. The specific priorities normally depend on the core target of the policymakers and may be limited by data availability, knowledge and analytic breadths of the tools. For example, suppose food perspective is taken as the dominant role in the nexus. In that case, energy and water supply are generally inputs of the model [55 ]. If another perspective, i.e. land, livelihood, is introduced into the framework, then WEF sectors are parallel subsystems for optimising land and livelihood benefits [56 ]. From the methods level, the top-down input-output analysis is the most widely used method for nexus footprints accounting associated with the resource-environmental impacts along the supply chains [57 ]. For example, Deng et al. used the nexus approach to explore the critical final demand by identifying the WEF intersections in the economic sector in China [58 ]. Feng et al. constricted the physical input-output model to quantify the WEF flows in Detroit Metropolitan Area and found that the major inflows of water and energy are outside imports, and more concern should be given to intermediate processes that consume water extensively [59 ]. The second approach is the bottom-up LCA [60 ], a frequently used tool to measure the lifecycle impacts. The other models and tools, i.e. network analysis [61 ], system dynamics-based model [62 ], integrated-based model [63 ], multi-objective optimisation model [64 ], bio-geophysical model [65 ], and agent-based model [66 ], etc. have been applied to simulate and assess the WEF nexus and formulate policy [30 ]. Despite the initial trial efforts in the model-based quantification of the WEF relationship, there is lacking consistent criteria for indicator selection, a clear definition of system boundaries, etc. In addition, existing transdisciplinary research scattered in a wide array of literature across diverse disciplines has led to the complexity of incorporating and operationalising all three sectors simultaneously in a coherent approach [67 ]. More effective tools such as the system dynamics model, complex network analysis, etc., are needed in the future to conquer the complexity of the WEF nexus system. Previously, a handful of empirical research has also been carried out to investigate the internal mechanism, pressures and drivers of the WEF nexus and to offer policy intervention suggestions for stakeholders and policymakers. Generally, the existing empirical studies of the WEF nexus focused on the resource-social system to ensure the overall equity in resource availability, security, and adaptability of the system in different scales, i.e. watershed [68 ], city [69 ], national [70 ], regional [71 ], and transboundary scales [72 ]. For example, Yi et al. proposed a methodology based on statistical data for WEF sustainability evaluation in Jiangsu province and tested it by empirical research. The result reveals that Jiangsu has embarked upon an unsustainable path regarding the WEF nexus [69 ]. Karlberg et al. assessed and compared the impact of alternative development trajectories on the study area by considering WEF proposed that the stakeholder-driven nexus approach can help to solve some challenges, i.e. the supply of biomass and water resources, and can complement the policy and strategy [68 ]. Since empirical approach has been introduced into the WEF nexus, it has gained increasing attention, yet, it has encountered some challenges, such as the data acquisition, information and knowledge gaps in understanding the WEF interconnections, i.e. the mechanism of mediating constraints in transregional or global trade is particularly important for urban systems, but remain poorly understood, this may require further progress.  2.3 Water-energy-climate/carbon (WEC) Three profoundly entwined processes significantly shape the network and drive the balances of water resources, energy availability, and carbon flows: groundwater withdrawal and utilisation, energy generation and consumption, and GHG emissions [73 ]. Identifying the WEC nexus is crucial for optimising the relevant managements and mitigating the environmental footprints. The WEC nexus related research has got significant development during the past years, especially over the past decade. Water utilisation, energy consumption and GHG emissions represent the top three significant environmental strategy elements. As shown by Fig. 6  , sectors of these three terms are inter-linked by different processes. Three dominant linkages of each sector demonstrate the complicated and comprehensive WEC network: internal effect (linkages begin and end in one specific sector), the net forward (arrows begin from one sector), and net backward (arrows end in one specific sector) [74 ]. For instance, irrigation water withdraws and transport, which is mandatory for the agriculture sector, usually consume a massive amount of energy, especially electricity. Energy can be used both directly and indirectly to cultivate, harvest, weed, etc. Energy generation and consumption related human activities are the most significant contributors to GHG emissions, which accelerates climate change [75 ]. The authors reviewed some milestones and key studies on the WEC nexus research, as shown in Table 1  . It was spelt out early by Nikolov and Fox [76 ] in 1994, exploring forest ecosystems' responses to climate change and carbon emissions based on a coupled carbon-water-energy-vegetation model. However, which was not attracted enough attention from both scientific and political communities. The study also mainly focused on model development instead of focusing on the “nexus” principle. Minimal studies were designed revolving around this topic over the following years. Sellers et al. [77 ] identified the transmissions of water, energy and carbon between the atmosphere and continents in 1997, which is the first study focused on the flows of water, energy and carbon simultaneously. It provided the guidance and reference for the studies followed up, however, which mainly based on and served for the meteorology. The meaning of WEC “nexus” was still not yet profoundly identified. Until 2000, the study by Choudhury [78 ] highlighted and explored the “relations” of WEC, and the case study focused on specific river basins. However, the WEC related studies were conducted under the background of meteorology and ecology until 2010 for exploring the WEC related were processed in different ecosystems under different meteorological conditions. The study undertaken by Gill [79 ] took the housing site as an example, explored the WEC nexus. It significantly extends the WEC nexus related studies to a broader system, covering both environmental and social dimensions. Stillwell et al. [80 ] comprehensively analysed the WEC relations and economic impacts of the city water system. This study involved the economic influences of the WEC nexus study, offering a more in-depth understanding of the WEC nexus. This topic has got significant development and extension since 2011. The most recent study made by Wang et al. [35 ] in 2020 proposed the WEC Network idea for the first time and explored the embodied WEC network and flows, as well as identified the unsustainable imbalances and inequities of embodied WEC flow amongst different economies or countries. Present WEC relevant studies mainly focus on the embodied materials flows assessment, the influences of WEC related strategies and the quantitative evaluation of the WEC nexus characteristics [25 ]. The sector level case studies are most considered in terms of sectoral efficiencies or coefficients of water and energy consumption and carbon emissions [83 ]. However, the exploration of the holistic research system and the feedback mechanism of the economy‐wide system is still very limited identified. The integration of multiple approaches, like the input-output model, supply chain network, LCA method, are recommended for assessing broader environmental and social influences, in addition to water-saving, carbon emissions mitigation and energy saving.  2.4 Water-energy-waste (WEW) Nexus approaches could assist in promoting cooperation amongst different sectors [84 ], elevating the efficiency of resource usage [32 ] and decreasing pollutants and wastes [85 ]. Based on the water-energy system, the concept of the water-energy-waste nexus has been developed. In the earlier time, the relationship between energy, water and waste has been broadly recognised and discussed since one source heavily relies on another source [86 ]. For example, although it was not called a nexus, Lehmann [87 ] adopted nexus thinking and designed wastewater for irrigation, which achieves synergies amongst energy, food and water. Kollmann et al. [88 ] designed the wastewater treatment plants as distributed energy cells in regional energy systems. The potential opportunities for wastewater recovery and waste heat utilisation were identified for the California tomato paste processing. The waste component has been widely incorporated, covering municipal solid waste, agricultural products, wastewater, atmospheric emissions, and oil consumption wastes [89 ]. It is noted that Núñez-López et al. [90 ] appealed to strong levels of system integration to improve the environment and reduce total cost. They built a multi-objective optimisation model to analyse a residential-level -energy-waste nexus. The targeted objectives, including the greenhouse gas emissions, freshwater consumption, and total cost of the integrated system, could be optimised at the same time. The integration of water-energy-waste was used in a residential complex of the city of Morelia in Mexico. By incorporating a life cycle sustainability assessment [91 ], three kinds of urban waste, namely municipal solid waste, wastewater, and agriculture waste, were considered in the assessment and optimisation framework. Several scenarios, including the base case, business-as -usual and policy interventions, were analysed to offer insights into the sustainable value chains. By analysing the water-energy-waste nexus using LCA, Friedrich et al. [92 ] assessed the environmental impacts and energy reduction through separating the blackwater/greywater at the source and co-digesting the blackwater with organic waste. The urban WEW nexus transformation promotes recovering nutrients from organic waste and black water, which assists in saving approximately 470 GWh/y energy bill of agricultural-use nitrogen in the neighbourhood of Heidelberg, Germany. There have been some new developments of the water-energy-waste nexus. They can be highlighted as follows:i. The basic water-energy-waste nexus incorporates more components, e.g. food. Using as an example the water-wastewater-waste-energy systems in an urban building stock of a German urban neighbourhood [92 ], the food-energy-water-waste in Southeast-Asian cities [93 ], the food-energy-water-waste nexus in a bioenergy production system in New York, USA [94 ], and the planning of food-energy-water-waste nexus in the Hunter Region in Australia [95 ].  ii. Replacing the conventional single-resource analysis by developing resource interlinkages that characterise policy priorities and research gaps [28 ], which was employed in the water-waste-energy-food nexus to improve resource governance in Brazil.  ii. Addressing challenges in the water-energy-waste nexus by developing new technologies. For example, Gong et al. [96 ] developed a waste corn stalk-based moisture absorber for electricity generation and water harvesting under all-weather atmospheric conditions, producing a stable open-circuit voltage with proper surface modification.     2.5 Water-energy-pollution (WEP) Interdisciplinary collaboration has been a hot and essential topic in coping with global challenges in water, energy, pollution, and sustainability [97 ]. Before the concept of water-energy-pollution nexus has been popular and widely accepted, researchers focused on the coupling relationship between water, energy and pollution. For instance, Jepsen [98 ] emphasised that frost control could be related to water, energy and pollution. Fetras and Nasrindoost [99 ] associated economic growth with water pollution, air pollution and energy consumption in Iran. Global urbanisation and growing population have overwhelmingly consumed global resources and caused pollution (waste, water and air), which triggers the development of the water-energy-pollution nexus in growing cities [100 ]. Although the concept could be applied to any cities, countries or regions, specific relationship and calculations are needed considering spatial heterogeneity. Rafindadi et al. [101 ] analysed the water-energy-pollution nexus in Asia-Pacific countries in the years 1975–2012. A significantly positive relationship has been found in the Asia-Pacific countries between water productivity, energy consumption, and air pollution using cross-sectional analysis. However, in the early years, there was no in-depth understanding of the nexus in the system. The water-energy-pollution nexus was innovatively employed by Landa-Cansigno et al. [102 ] to quantitatively assess the performance of urban water metabolism of integrated water systems in two cities in Guanajuato in Mexico. The decentralised and centralised water reuse strategies were compared based on the proposed quantitative framework with consideration of multiple impacts, including water, energy, pollutants, costs, materials and other environmental impacts. For the cases in Mexico, the decentralised strategies were demonstrated to have superiorities in terms of GHG emissions, water usage, and eutrophication factors over centralised strategies. To date, the concept of water-energy-pollution nexus thinking has been well-known, while the potential challenges lie in quantitative modelling and comprehensive assessment.  2.6 Water-energy-land (WEL) Water, energy and land are the most important resources worldwide. However, the extent and measures of exploitation have contributed to increased climate change and environmental pressure [103 ]. In the meantime, the systems that offer the resources are sensitive to climate change. It is of great importance to efficiently and comprehensively manage these resources. The nexus thinking of two sectors has been widely studied, especially the linkages between water and energy, water and land. Much less has been designed on the water-energy-land (WEL) nexus. However, it is increasingly identified that multiple aspects/sectors are usually interlinked under broader and mutually interacting systems. The integration of environmental assessments in terms of WEL is crucial for consistent strategy making and effective utilisation. Fig. 7   shows the extended framework of the WEL nexus for evaluating the interlinkages amongst water, energy and land. Both direct and indirect impact factors can influence the WEL network, consequently shaping the outcome in terms of human well-being and environmental sustainability. The land was not widely involved in most nexus related studies and strategies; however, it is extremely crucial for providing both water (like underground water) and energy (like natural gas, biofuels) [104 ]. Global land demand has been rapidly increasing for sustaining the growth of food demand, water use and energy consumption and the living standard growing. As a result, many areas worldwide are experiencing land management related problems and challenges [105 ]. These problems would be increasingly critical in the following decades because of population growth and continuous climate change. The priority for decision-makers is to adapt the WEL thinking management to meet the requirements of multiple stakeholders. However, the WEL system management strategies are usually linked with different trade-offs across multi-sectors and multi-regions regarding water use, energy supply and land availability. If the current energy consumption pattern continues, energy demand worldwide is predicted to increase by 80% by the year 2050, while 66% global population would live in the countries with water stress challenges by 2025 [106 ]. As the topwater and large energy consumer, the land sector requires long-sighted approaches, especially under climate change. Brandi et al. [107 ] clearly explained the importance of WEL nexus thinking for future sustainability agendas. Cremades et al. [108 ] proposed ten principles for integrating the WEL nexus under climate change to conduct comprehensive environmental assessments. The principles are also generated for supporting the sustainable and consistent strategies that are touching the utilisation of multiple resources and linking multiple ecosystem services. Some case studies have approved that the WEL nexus idea is crucial for proper policies making in a specific sector. Hunt et al. [109 ] explored the national reservoir dams performance from the WEL nexus perspective. It mentioned that both the proposed and existing hydropower reservoirs have considerable demand for land and water resources and energy management matters. For hydropower, the water availability and the competition for land occupation result in challenges of minimising environmental impacts. Guan et al. [110 ] identified the national supply chain of China from the WEL nexus perspective. They analysed the demand-driven land, water and energy resources of different economic sectors. Results show that agriculture, heavy industry, services industry and construction are the key sectors of the WEL nexus. The critical pathways of the WEL nexus were also identified, which reflected the complex relationship amongst water, energy and land use in China, as well as the other regions worldwide. The proper control of the critical WEL nexus sectors and transmission pathways is crucial for obtaining multiple benefits for multiple stakeholders. At present, although there is clear interdependency amongst different resources systems, the policies designed for WEL related sectors mainly focus on the cross-sector effects in terms of different resources. However, adequate policies should cover and account for the full picture of environmental, social, economic and ecological preconditions [27 ]. Against the backdrop of increasingly limited water, energy, and land resources, devising appropriate policies for WEL nexus management becomes exceedingly complex. These policies or strategies should cover the interactions amongst different individual sectors or resources. However, implementation often lacks so far, which needs further progress.  2.7 Water-energy + others There have been several extensions of the WE nexus, as discussed in the earlier section. Fig. 8  , generated by the authors, summarised the commonly discussed nexus (boxes in solid line) and the other extensions (boxes in dotted line), which are still developing. Elshkaki et al. [111 ] assessed the water-energy-material nexus where the material refers to the aluminium and steel by Sun et al. [112 ]. In some cases, it is also referring to metal [113 ] or mineral [114 ] (see yellow boxes in Fig. 8 ). Water-energy-material-emissions nexus has also been previously evaluated by Elshkaki [115 ] for the case of PV solar technologies using a dynamic material flow stock model. The production of materials, e.g. steel, required a significant amount of energy and water. It is not a one-way relationship as the water treatment plant and energy generation plant require maintenance and construction materials. The nexus is also between water and energy, where water is required for cooling and energy is needed in water treatment. Another crucial resources nexus is the Water-Energy-Nutrient nexus, which in some cases refer to the Water-Energy-Nitrogen nexus [116 ] or water-energy-agriculture nexus [117 ]. Wen et al. [118 ] developed a model to evaluate the metabolism performance of water-energy-nutrient nexus for eco-towns. The assessed nutrients include carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. Jalilov et al. [119 ], on the other hand, assessed the water-energy-agriculture nexus of utilising the river basin in Central Asia. The agriculture of the case study [119 ] is referring to the production of cotton and wheat. Agriculture is a broad term closely related to water-energy-food, water-energy-land and water-energy-nitrogen. Water-energy-agriculture, similar to water-energy-biodiversity, water-energy-ecosystem [120 ] and water-energy-environment [121 ], is in contrast to the other resource's nexus. This suggests the inconsistent interpretation of “nexus” and the possibility of being a buzzword. For example, Shayesteh et al. [122 ] assessed the water-energy-environment nexus of the reverse osmosis system. Is the nexus an English term, defining the trade-offs/correlation, e.g. water consumption, energy efficiency versus environmental performance, or institutionalise [123 ], representing a specific concept and framework? In the study by Bleischwitz et al. [32 ], resource nexus is defined as “a set of context-specific critical interlinkage between two or more natural resources used in delivery chains towards systems of provision for water, energy, land and materials”. It was highlighted that nexus research could assist in the delivery of SDGs. However, based on the current inconsistent nexus development, including resources, sector (e.g. agriculture), dimension (e.g. environment) and impacts (e.g. health [124 ]), “nexus” seems to be a general term where integration in various domains is possible. A clearer nexus methodology for LCA, consisting of inventory (inputs, outputs), mid-point categories (e.g. global warming), and end-point categories (e.g. damage to human health), can be beneficial.   3 Importance of nexus thinking in CE towards SDGs The rising environmental issues and climate change exert increasing attention on water resources management, energy resources, and WE extended nexus. A lot of measures or strategies have been designed revolving around low-carbon emissions, water scarcity, energy consumption, etc. However, this is not the complete picture. The population increase worldwide has been resulting in a significant demand increase in water, energy, and food involved materials. It is never an issue that can be solved by one or several measures. It could be argued that the United Nation (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) [125 ] and the more recent Paris Agreement [126 ] have not been fully effective in achieving any real impact. Global warming has continually risen despite the measures or targets. CE offers an idea to minimising the utilisation of water, energy, and different kind of resources, as well as waste generation [127 ]. So far, most nexus related studies still involve two resources, like food and water, water and energy [30 ]. More efforts have been making to involve more resources and even sector. For example, the nexus between food production and other two scarce resources, water and energy, in 21 countries worldwide have been explored by Menegaki and Tiwari [128 ] based on the wide data from 1990 to 2000. The WE extended nexus provides a broader system of thinking in the CE towards SDGs, as shown by Fig. 9   generated by the authors. Each kind of WE extended nexus links towards different SDGs, and the CE serves as one of the principles for minimising the environmental footprints. 3.1 WEF towards SDG2, SDG6 and SDG7 The booming population, diet diversion, quick urbanisation, and economic growth will predominantly drive the worldwide demand for the three basic needs. Demand for energy, food and water are estimated to increase by 50%, 35%, and 40% by 2030 [129 ]. How to sustainably feed 10 G people in the year 2050 has posed a significant threat to the WEF nexus [130 ]. Currently, 844 M people still have no access to safe drinking water [131 ], 770 M people cannot use electricity [132 ], and 815 M people suffer from chronic malnutrition [50 ]. As illustrated in Fig. 2 , The SDGs gives further impetus to the WEF nexus approach across the SDG2 (zero hunger), SDG6 (clean water and sanitation), and SDG7 (affordable and clean energy) [133 ]. The nexus can directly influence the implementation of three goals and indirectly impact all other SDGs due to the interconnections of the 17 goals [30 ]. This indicates that balancing the trade-off to increase the overall sustainability and robustness of the WEF nexus may generate a positive domino effect in promoting the progress of other goals, consequently [134 ], and vice versa. Further, more attention should be paid to how to combine the WEF nexus approaches with the SDGs at different research scales and how it would help to minimise the risks of actions targeting one goal while undermining the accomplishment of another. For instance, to explore the interactions in the SDGs, Weitz et al. put forward three approaches: (a) screen the targets; (b) explore the potential interactions of targets and where the potential trade-offs and synergies exist; (c) identify possible “nexus targets” related to the three sectors, improve the entire efficiency and look beyond the WEF-nexus [135 ]. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, the existing research that links WEF-nexus with SDGs are primarily in the conceptual realm and aim at the national scale [48 ] and on policy-making [136 ]. Few of the framework has been introduced and tested by a case study, especially in small scale projects. The CE is targeted to achieve economic prosperity and environmental quality, and this is highly consistent with nexus thinking, hence to better achieve the SDGs, the CE concept can provide a system integrated perspective in understanding the interdependencies amongst these water, energy and food sectors along the supply chains. To date, there are enormous studies designed for the CE topic. However, the research that explicitly advocates the use of CE principles to support the WEF nexus is still limited [22 ]. Brandoni et al. depicted an overview of the performance of the WEF nexus in the European Union (EU) by focusing on the energy axis and explained how CE could deal with the challenges in the future [137 ]. One example of incorporating the CE framework into the WEF nexus is to combine the food wastes with sludge from wastewater to produce biogas [22 ]. At the city level, Xue et al. [138 ] attempted to develop open access online tools–the Urban Circular Economy Calculator (UCEC), which can simulate different CE scenarios associated with WEF management, and the data of Beijing was then used as a test case. In particular, more than 20 CE policies related to water, energy and food were selected and divided into six categories. Ultimately, the trajectories of policy impacts were tested through long-term simulations of environmental and social-economic impacts [138 ]. From the CE perspective, there exist many potential opportunities for future exploration in the WEF nexus, for example, heat recovery from grey water, food loss reduction and wastes utilisation, energy and nutrients recovery from waste water, etc.  3.2 WEC towards SDG6, SDG7 and SDG13 GHG emissions and climate change continually rise despite the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement [125 ]. The 1.5 °C thresholds would be reached in the coming 15 to 20 y if the current patterns continue, and the GHG emissions must be reduced to zero within 30–40 y if the temperature growth no more than 1.5 °C [139 ]. This is an ambition and also a daunting target. Based on the results of Smith et al. [140 ], the likelihood of 1.5 °C might significantly reduce if the stringent emission reduction measures were postponed globally to the year 2030. The key challenge is, in some regions, climate change (global warming) has, and definitely will continue to be, much greater than the global average [141 ], which also rose to a new record in the year 2019 [142 ]. Six climate change-related positive actions were proposed based on the SDGs to build more sustainable economies and societies: green economy, green transition, green jobs and sustainable and inclusive growth, invest in sustainable solutions, confront all climate risks, and cooperate [142 ]. However, the only way to achieve the goals is to improve the efficiency of water, energy and increase the renewable energy share in the whole energy structure, despite many policies that have been designed to revolve around GHG emissions. Consider the growing requirements of water and energy and continuous climate change, more nexus thinking and approaches should be involved and integrated to explore the WEC nexus idea towards SDGs [143 ]. Water, energy, GHG emissions and climate change are never independent. The WEC nexus offers a significant added value in the systemic thinking of the complex system from the supply chain perspective, covering multiple economic sectors in different economies or regions [144 ]. Giannetti et al. [145 ] proposed that the integrated methods are crucial for clarifying and evidencing the interdependencies of the WEC system and SDGs and effectively expediting the implementation via cleaner production measures. Borghi et al. [22 ] discuss the CE approaches for reducing the WEC nexus. They revealed very limited literature that explicitly promotes CE principles and approaches for supporting the WEC nexus exploration, despite many CE-related articles. The WEC nexus concept, with the support of SDGs and CE principles that should be applied for truly paving the way forward, would evolve to boost efficiency across all nexus pillars. Nevertheless, these “ideal” approaches are still primarily in the conceptual realm and applied to support political decision making. The reality of these targets still needs a more robust and extended framework and more in-depth exploration based on more case studies.  3.3 WEW and WEP towards SDG6, SDG7 and SDG12 The nexus thinking approach has been increasingly accepted as an integrated concept that bridges different industries and sectors to achieve effective resources management [146 ]. The nexus thinking of water-energy-waste and water-energy-pollution sought holistic and integrated solutions to waste treatment, water sustainability, pollution reduction and energy enhancement. As mentioned by Bleischwitz et al. [32 ], nexus thinking could assist in improving governance and management to guarantee environmental/urban sustainability while meeting the other requirements. The nexus thinking that focuses on circular energy, water, material flows, and waste result in economic and sustainability benefits [147 ]. Mancini et al. [148 ] proposed an industrial symbiosis-based approach under the water-waste-energy nexus, which includes a wastewater treatment plant, a waste to energy plant and an anaerobic digestion plant. Compared to the other two scenarios without circularity or with a relatively low degree of circularity, only the industrial symbiosis scenario achieves an energy balance to obtain the 100% reuse of wastewater and the 100% biogas up-gradation, which addresses the “Not In Anyone's Backyard” opposition to waste-to-energy plants [148 ]. Other studies related to the importance of nexus thinking to SDGs are referred to the sustainable city development by understanding the urban water-energy-waste systems [149 ], the sustainable management of food waste in a nexus thinking manner [150 ], the sustainable organic waste management in the water-energy-food nexus [85 ], and the CE and responsibility of water, energy and waste [151 ], and the integrated water systems under the water-energy-pollution nexus [102 ]. Overall, the WEW and WEP are not only associated with SDG6 (Clean water and sanitation), SDG7 (Affordable and clean energy) and SDG12 (responsible consumption and production) directly, but also connected with SDG3 (good health and well-being), SDG11 (sustainable cities and communities), and SDG14 (life below water) indirectly. Both developed countries and less-developed countries could benefit from nexus thinking to accelerate the progress of SDGs. However, the latter faced more challenges. The energy-water nexus has been explored and explained well in some developed countries; however, most of the less-developed countries are still on the way to accept the nexus concept and sought feasible nexus solutions for specific countries [152 ]. In addition, less-developed countries are more vulnerable to the current emergent situation, i.e. COVID-19 pandemics, than developed countries, partially due to fewer resources and less global support to guarantee the planned progress towards SDGs [153 ]. In the developed countries/regions, solid waste and wastewater can be processed by some advanced technologies to enhance the CE. In the less-developed regions with a majority of the world population, it is noted that the tailored nexus thinking could also contribute to SDGs through proper planning and location for different sectors [154 ]. For example, in water-scarce Egypt, wastewater from and industrial, municipal and agricultural have been efficiently reused for food production. The resulting irrigation efficiency has elevated from < 50% to > 80% [155 ]. The local characteristics and infrastructure of waste-to-energy technologies and local agricultural products, including cassava, banana and corn, have been fully utilised in the sustainable Urban Water-Energy-Waste Systems of Ghana in sub-Saharan Africa [91 ]. Abbass et al. [156 ] highlighted the potential application of the energy-pollution-water nexus in the north and middle east Africa region, leading to integrated solutions for reducing air pollution and addressing other urban issues with impacts on human health. Although the less-developed countries have been designing their solutions, more collaborations and coordination could promote functions of the nexus thinking in CE towards SDGs.  3.4 WEL towards SDG2, SDG6 and SDG7 The WEL nexus thinking pursues a holistic and integrated approach for improving water and energy efficiency and land use rationality, along with the WEL system more reasonable management. As demonstrated by the study of Elagib et al. [157 ], properly land-use strategies and practices are valuable interventions for mitigating climate change pressure, water scarcity, energy risk and food security issues, and improving sustainable development opportunities. Land is the foundation of food, which is the reason that land and food are usually mentioned together in exiting studies. Hunger has always been one of the most critical challenge globally [158 ]. Although the growth of people that suffer from hunger slowed from the year 2015, one in nine people are undernourished, and one in eleven are hungry worldwide, which is still growing up [159 ]. It is predicted that the situation would be much worse by 2030, and the proportion of hungry people would be higher than 10% [159 ]. The unsustainable global imbalances of land-use efficiencies and land demand are critical for food scarcity [160 ], and the uneven water and energy distribution exacerbates the problem. CE principle can serve as a guideline for a more reasonable land use pattern. Chowdhury et al. [161 ] proposed a bio-based land use framework based on the CE idea to be a more sustainable alternative to manage contamination risks and restore soil health. However, this is not strong enough to maintain the robustness and stability of the holistic WEL system. The WEL nexus, prominently involving foot term in the multi-ecosystem-services, is a systematic method for resources management to understand the limited, linked and complex nature of different kinds of resources [108 ]. The idea is developed to support consistent and stable strategies that involve multi-resources and relevant environmental benefits. The WEL nexus thinking is consistent with and under the SDGs, in the meantime, mostly linked to the goals SDG2 zero hunger, SDG6 clean water, SDG7 clean energy and SDG15 life on land. However, practices and case studies still lack. Cremades et al. [108 ] mentioned that it is important to define the prominent features of the nexus of a specific case for exploring the WEL nexus. In the meantime, the property of the approaches used in the case studies should be justified. Some principles should be followed when conducting the WEL case studies, including “the water-energy-land nexus goes beyond the classic climate impact modelling chains and there is a need to consider the nexus as a complex system”, etc.   4 The implication for future research In recent years, water-energy extended nexuses have been increasingly employed and developed for worldwide applications. However, the development of nexus thinking and its implementation are still in the infancy period. This section offers some implications of future research according to the team's experience, which is aimed to trigger more discussion about the future development and application of the water-energy extended nexuses. Fig. 10  , developed by the authors, shows a framework in which five components are essential for analysis, modelling, and assessment. They include (i) the development of standards, (ii) public data sharing, (iii) innovation of method applications, (iv) new technologies and solutions for the water-energy nexus, and (v) possible emergent scenarios that impact the nexus. The details of the conceptual framework are discussed as follows: With the development/incorporation of these key components, more practical works/research could be enhanced in terms of holistic nexus thinking, environmental footprints and quantification, comprehensive assessment, and crises and opportunities. These possible extensions have coupling relations, which could support each other, contributing to both regional and global sustainability. Table 2   shows relevant case studies of WE extended nexuses contributing to sustainability in different scenarios. Development of Standard.  The identified issue that required more research attention is the potential of “nexus” being a buzzword. Nexus is still a term whose power derives from a combination of vagueness meaning and strong normative resonance [123 ]. The argument on the physical meaning and practicability of nexus is not a new discovery and has been a continuous debate [32 ]. However, by assessing the nexus related publications (e.g. refer to Section 2.7 ), it is perceived the existence of such concern. Nexus understands as a noun in English term, “a complicated series of connections or interlinkages between different things”, is apparent. As a framework, method, scale/level, and tools can vary depending on whom you asked. Nexus approaches can appear as assessment, optimisation or decision-making studies. Based on the understanding by authors, nexus is more to a scope, boundary or framework of a study, considering different interaction between different factors. There have been studies to propose tools specifically for nexus, such as the WEF Nexus tool 2.0 [168 ] and NEST v1.0 [169 ]. However, in most of these cases, especially with the rapid development, nexus is just a more attractive term to replace the specific expressions such as “multi-criteria optimisation”, “trade-offs”, “correlation/relationship study”, “input-output assessment”, and “integrated design”. For example, the WEF nexus was studied by Namany et al. [170 ]. It is a multi-objective optimisation. This leaves an open question on the identity of “nexus”, as a comprehensive optimisation originally consider the trade-off of different factors. It is still unclear the required components to be considered as nexus study, unlike LCA, which is relatively established with the introduction of the ISO standard [171 ]. Based on the study of Nazmul Islam et al. [42 ], an overarching framework or standard is pivotal for enabling the systematic evaluation of nexus issues. The nexus methodology is still suffering from inconsistency and vagueness [122 ]. The development of the standard is important to avoid potential confusion and put the nexus thinking into practice. For quantification, it can be based on footprints analysis [172 ]. As a framework and methodology, Total Site Integration [171 ], which has similar principles and aim to “nexus”, can be beneficial as a basis for further development. On top of the resources nexus (e.g. energy, water), the nexus between facilities (e.g. plants) or regions are considered in the integrated design towards an economic and environmental benefits system. Holistic Thinking and Related Data Preparation . Based on the retrospect and analysis of water-energy extended nexus, as well as the system thinking in a CE towards SDGs, for the future outlook, an integrated research framework would be increasingly critical to achieving common goals towards the generation of the optimal plan. Despite the universal acceptance of the nexus thinking concept, the existing studies remain at a very fundamental level with limitations in various aspects, which uncovers the uncertainties and research gaps on the holistic nexus perspective about the conceptual frame [173 ]. First of all, the methodology framework of nexus for different objectives entails an urgent need to be expanded properly and well adapted for diverse water-energy related nexus types, and dynamic models need to be constructed to depict better the multiple complexities, uncertainty, synergies and trade-off attributes within the system in various scales. Second, policy, as well as technical solutions for addressing the future challenges in the separate sector, also need to be evaluated through the lens of nexus thinking to minimise trade-offs and maximise synergies, especially at urban scales [46 ]. For the basic research tools and methods, more efforts are required to incorporate integrated lifecycle thinking and evaluation within the nexus framework [174 ]. This enables the comparison of the different options to achieve the favoured solution by avoiding the exacerbation and shifting of pressure amongst the WEF sectors and enhance the efficacy of decision-making under different scenarios. In addition, to further minimise the potential conflicts sectors, it may be essential to link multiple models and evaluate the flows of resources in each sector and the associated environment-economic impacts based on multiple methods in the future. The lack of accurate data is another obstacle to the research of nexus thinking. For example, integrating LCA requires the application of a life cycle inventory (LCI) database in specific regions to achieve robust analysis. More relevant databases with spatiotemporal data are urgent to be updated/built. To effectively utilise the potential big urban data, advanced statistical methods regarding data processing and uncertainty analysis need to be developed. Environmental Footprints for Quantifying the Nexus.  As a type of quantitative methods, footprint analysis is one of the fundamental tools for resource-environmental problems. The reviewed water-energy extended nexus covers water footprint, energy footprint, food footprint, carbon/GHG footprint, waste/pollution footprint, land-use footprint. These footprints and some more relevant ones have been overviewed and defined by Čuček et al. [175 ]. Two complementary types of footprint analysis methods are the bottom-up LCA and the top-down input-output analysis [46 ]. Čuček et al. [176 ] also overviewed and analysed the carbon emissions footprint and nitrogen footprint in the carbon-nitrogen nexus using LCA, contributing to the trade-offs of carbon and nitrogen in biomass energy production. From a water-energy nexus perspective, the carbon emissions, water and energy-related input and output footprints are quantified for nine wastewater treatment plants in China to reduce grey water footprint and energy consumption [177 ]. Lee et al. [178 ] assessed and analysed the blue-water and land-use footprints in the agricultural water-energy-food nexus under climate change constraints and quantified the trade-offs amongst resources under different scenarios of climate change. More overviews regarding the application of footprints in quantitative assessment and are referred to Chen et al. [179 ]. With the development of nexus thinking, several aspects of footprint analysis could be enhanced in future applications.i. The footprint analysis has the potential to promote progress towards SDGs; however, overlaps between different footprints have been identified in the footprint family [143 ], which hinders the clear understanding of the nexus of interest. For improving the assessment accuracy, it is challenging and necessary to identify the quantified footprints to avoid misleading decision-making with the overlaps of footprints, particularly for the nexus-related studies on a global or regional scale.  ii. Before measuring footprints, a proper design of nexus is essential as any nexuses are not complete in practical applications. In the designing phase, more in-depth understanding is needed to consider a suitable nexus for a specific city/region or an objective with cross regions, rather than a simple WEF, WEC, WEW, or WEL. Then, a comprehensive footprint analysis could be utilised for the designed nexus. Considering the inter-regional scale problems, both direct and embodied water, energy and carbon flow/footprints should be analysed using quantification methods, e.g. the inter-regional input-output model [180 ]. In addition, in the water-energy extended nexuses, a comprehensive assessment of socio-economic footprints should also be included when the related data are available to make better decision or policies.  ii. Extended applications of footprint analysis: Chen et al. [180 ] summarised two extensions of footprint analysis, including the element tracing and mathematical linear programming optimisation based on footprint analysis to assess and analyse the sustainability of wastewater treatment plants. Lee et al. [178 ] performed a machine-learning clustering based on footprint analysis to assess the differences between footprints under various conditions. More practical applications through hybridising system dynamics, game analysis and robust nonlinear optimisation might have the potential to guide better water-energy nexus management.    The Challenges of Analysis Methods and the Possible Recommendation : Both regional and global WE extended nexus are complicated systems. Multiple sectors, regions and different stakeholders are involved. The interregional and international trades are proven highly dependent by all countries worldwide, especially under the COVID-19 pandemic [181 ]. Different methods could be employed for identifying the extended nexus based on WE, such as Material Flow Analysis (MFA) [182 ] and LCA [92 ]. These approaches are flexible for quantifying environmental performance and convenient for data integration. The input-output (IO) model is another widely used tool on this topic [12 ]. The input-output model can properly identify virtual environmental impacts and virtual footprints, especially when the case covers multi-regions and multi-sectors. However, the common challenges for these methods are the requirements for massive data and high data quality [183 ]. Fortunately, increasingly blooming open-source data used for water and energy analytics have been providing more opportunities to improve the extended WE nexuses and broaden the study scale from both the micro and macro level. For example, the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) [184 ], International Energy Agency (IEA) database [185 ], etc., provide fundamental and crucial data support for conducting the relevant study. Another reasonable method should be the Multi-Criteria (MC) analysis [186 ], however, which does not have the quantitative capacity as the input-output analysis [83 ]. However, the aggregation error might be happening due to combining different products under a single sector for the input-output method, and the city-level or small regional scale input-output databases are limited. The methods that can be properly employed for assessing the WE extended nexus with multi-region and -sectors should have the following characteristics:i. Focus on multiple sectors from the supply chain perspective. WE extended nexus usually involve multiple sectors; the embodied resource flows cover the whole supply chain. It is important to identify the embedded environmental footprints and explore the environmental impacts of the supply chain.  ii. Accurately identify the linkages amongst different regions. Inter-regional trade is based on economic activities in different regions. A large number of resources are transferred and shared amongst multiple regions. Clear identification of the linkages amongst different regions is pivotal for accurately assess the environmental footprints of different regions and supply chain.  ii. Based on the above two points, the methods should also identify the virtual material flows between different sectors and regions, including embodied water flows, embodied energy flows, embodied carbon flows, etc.  iv. Comprehensively assess the environmental impacts of different human activities, including carbon emissions, etc.  v. Accurately quantify the efficiencies of different materials, including water utilisation coefficients, energy consumption coefficients, and carbon emissions coefficients.    In the current phase, many methods have been employed for analysing nexus modelling. Zhang et al. [46 ] summarised three different types of methods, including optimal management methods, systematic simulation and assessment, and environmental footprint methods. As discussed in Section 2.5 , quantitative modelling has been a new trend for nexus analysis. Some quantitative methods, such as multi-objective optimisation [90 ], LCA [92 ], and Bayesian networks [187 ], have been incorporated in the nexus analysis. These methods are generally based on historical data collected in specific cities. It is also beneficial to see how to consider the future trend and uncertainties under the nexus analysis. Two types of methods may have greater applications in this field. First, machine learning models have presented significant superiorities in trend forecasting and analysis, which has been utilised for the energy-water nexus [188 ]. Information and communication technology (ICT) solutions are still in the infancy of the CE [189 ]. In the future, machine learning-based ICT solutions deserve more assessment and investigation. Second, robust optimisation [190 ] has been widely used for optimisation problems with uncertainties [191 ]. The newly proposed robust optimisation models have been developed for CE-related contents [192 ]. In the future, the multi-objective robust optimisation may find its place for the nexus modelling and analysis in CE. New Technologies/Solutions and the Related Comprehensive Assessment . New technologies would always be sought in the water-energy extended systems to improve the water usage and energy efficiencies, such as the waste corn stalk-based moisture absorber [96 ], the green synthesis of carbon nanotubes [193 ], some new development of pressure retarded osmosis membranes [194 ], and the reverse osmosis and capacitive deionisation for brackish water desalination [195 ]. Two main issues deserve broad attention. First, both the environmental impacts and economic feasibility related to these new technologies should be assessed comprehensively. Second, when introducing new technologies into the current market, in particular, the market with multiple stakeholders under nexus thinking, the new market may have a new balance/equilibrium [196 ]. The market competition and the effect of technology efficiency need to be assessed carefully. New solutions have also been investigated to save water and energy and improve the efficiency and performance of the nexus systems. For example, in the WEF nexus, drip irrigation, soil mulching, precision agriculture, deficit irrigation, and distribution optimisation of cropping patterns were employed [197 ]. In addition to the specific solutions, the Internet of Things (IoT) has been increasingly adopted as new solutions in the water-energy extended nexus [198 ], smart farming application in the WEF system [199 ], policy regulations [200 ], water sustainability [201 ], and sustainable development of smart cities [202 ]. With more and more new solutions, some questions may be of interests to managers:i) How do researchers comprehensively assess the effects of these new solutions?  ii) What is the best pathway regarding the transitions of new solutions for a specific city/countries/region? and  iii) How can the best practice of the developed countries be replicated or adapted to less developed countries to achieve SDGs?    The Impacts of COVID-19 and Its Opportunities . Most of the SDGs have been hindered by COVID-19 severely [203 ], of which two-thirds have been unlikely to be met according to the current estimation [204 ], let alone that the progress of the 17 SDGs was relatively slow even before the pandemic [205 ]. The impacts of COVID-19 are multi-folds, including the water [206 ], energy [207 ], medical waste [181 ], municipal waste [208 ], food [209 ], climate [210 ], and urban sustainability [211 ]. As nearly all the components of the focused nexuses in this review paper have been impacted, it has great uncertainties regarding the progress of the SDGs during and especially after COVID-19. A rapid response should be launched by worldwide researchers to cope with the impacts of COVID-19 on SDGs [212 ]. Barbier and Burgess [153 ] offered three policies mainly on clean and sustainable energy transitions for low and middle-income countries to cope with the impacts of COVID-19 on the progress of SDGs. The nexus thinking would be an effective manner in CE towards SDGs. COVID-19 could also act as an important role in the water-energy extended nexus systems. For example, Zhao and You [213 ] considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the water-energy-food-waste nexus system to mitigate the environmental and health issues regarding the food waste generation in the new circumstances in New York, USA. What has been useful lessons for the study of water-energy extended nexuses are to prepare for emergent scenarios, e.g. global pandemics, which could increase the reliability of the nexus systems. In addition, any crises would accompany potential opportunities. As mentioned by Leal Filho et al. [214 ], the COVID-19 not only poses a threat to the implementation of SDGs but also offers global opportunities and changing points regarding the realisation of the United States Agenda 2030 in a whole paradigm. More investigation could contribute to the other nexus related studies by incorporating the constraints of possible emergent scenarios, including the COVID-19 pandemics.  5 Conclusion In this study, the water-energy extended nexuses towards environmental-related SDGs are reviewed from the perspective of both relationship and practicability. WEF, WEC, WEW, WEP, WEL and other kinds of WE related nexuses are retrospected, discussing the linkages between each of them and relevant SDGs. Research gaps and implications for future work (Section 4 ) are summarised. This review highlighted the potential pitfall of “nexus” as a buzzword and a need for clear and consistent methodology, preferably developing a standard. The understanding of nexus is politically oriented declarations that basically studies integration. Other than the discussed optimisation and assessment method, including footprints quantification, Total Site Integration and notably the recently developed Ecototal Site Symbiosis, which closely follows the nexus concept, provides beneficial Contribution for future development nexus methodology. The other remarks are as below:i. The current nexus is more of a general term. “Nexus” has been increasingly used for “linking” different environmental terms, the positioning of “nexus” becomes ambiguous. In increasing cases, nexus is a more attractively sounding term to replace the specific expressions. Despite the universal acceptance of the nexus thinking concept, the existing studies remain at a very fundamental level with limitations in various aspects, which uncovers the uncertainties and research gaps on the holistic nexus perspective about the conceptual frame.  ii. An integrated research framework would be increasingly critical to achieving common goals towards generating the optimal plan. The methodology of nexus for different objectives entails an urgent need to be appropriately expanded and well adapted for diverse water-energy related nexus types, and dynamic models need to be constructed to depict better the multiple complexities, uncertainty, synergies and trade-off attributes within the system in various scales. It is essential to integrate multiple models and evaluate the flows of resources in each sector and the associated environment-economic impacts based on multiple methods in the future. More relevant databases with spatiotemporal data are urgent to be updated/built.  ii. Interdisciplinary nexus requests the integration of multiple methods to identify the complicated flows in the nexus network. Comprehensive approaches, like optimal management methods, systematic simulation and assessment, and environmental footprint methods, represent a new trend to enable nexus quantification. The footprints approach can be the proper tool to quantify the “nexus”, based on it is one of the fundamental tools for resource-environmental problems. Two complementary types of footprint analysis methods, the bottom-up LCA and top-down input-output analysis, offer a solution.  iv. The methodologies that can be adequately employed in the future for assessing the WE extended nexus with multi-region and -sectors should have the following characteristics: (a) Focusing on multiple sectors from the supply chain perspective; (b) Identifying the linkages amongst different regions accurately; (c) Identifying the virtual material flows between different sectors and regions; (d) Assessing the environmental impacts of different human activities comprehensively; (e) Quantifying the efficiencies of different materials accurately.
