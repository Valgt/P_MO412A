               Sustainability is achieved when we use a portion and preserve the rest for future generations. It has come up as a potential means to combat the ill effects of anthropogenic development and therefore needs to be adapted as the new way of life. The United Nations has targeted to achieve 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the end of 2030. These include sustainable management of clean water and sanitation, ensuring access to sustainable energy, building a sustainable ecosystem on land as well as water, etc. This chapter focuses on how these SDGs are being achieved or worked upon by recent developments in science. Some of these include replacing cement with agricultural waste composites made from wheat straw and perlite and hydrocarbon degrading microbes. Research works have witnessed the successful removal of heavy metals by plant–microbe symbiosis and the incorporation of agricultural wastes in the textile industry as a replacement of fibres.
               A few other findings worth mentioning here are the reclamation of waste land by microbes and plants, wastewater and waste-soil treatment using microbes, and aggressively growing plants and lignocellulosic materials. Bioherbicides, bioweedicides and biofuel generation from agricultural wastes have also been explored. Biotechnological interventions and manoeuvring of these microbes and plants promise to further enhance their remediating skills and so can be seen as a powerful tool for alleviating environmental challenges on our way to a sustainable life.

Research works have witnessed the successful removal of heavy metals by plant–microbe symbiosis and the incorporation of agricultural wastes in the textile industry as a replacement of fibres. A few other findings worth mentioning here are the reclamation of waste land by microbes and plants, wastewater and waste-soil treatment using microbes, and aggressively growing plants and lignocellulosic materials. Bioherbicides, bioweedicides and biofuel generation from agricultural wastes have also been explored. Biotechnological interventions and manoeuvring of these microbes and plants promise to further enhance their remediating skills and so can be seen as a powerful tool for alleviating environmental challenges on our way to a sustainable life.

Resources around us are being depleted at unrecoverable rates. It’s high time we learn to use these resources judiciously. This needs to be followed not just in one or two countries, but in all the countries across the world. The United Nations has urged all partner countries to complete 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the end of 2030. All 193 United Nations partner countries have come together to make it possible. The 17 goals that United Nations aims to achieve following [1–3] :1. Ending poverty in all forms  2. Achieving food security and promoting sustainable agriculture  3. Ensuring healthy living and well-being for all age groups  4. Ensuring equality in education and promoting lifelong learning  5. Achieving gender equality  6. Ensuring availability and sustainable management of water resources  7. Ensuring access to sustainable energy for all  8. Promoting sustainable economic growth, that is, making employment opportunities for all  9. Creating sustainable industrialization  10. Reducing inequality among countries  11. Making human settlements sustainable   12. Ensuring sustainable production and consumption  13. Combating climate change  14. Ensuring sustainable use of marine resources  15. Sustainable management of forests and ecosystems  16. Promoting peaceful and inclusive societies  17. Revamping global partnerships to achieve SDGs    These goals show that the United Nations aims to achieve sustainable living in all different spheres of life. It has not restricted itself to the environment alone. However, the majority of it is related to the environment as all living on this planet is being made possible by the environment and the resources that it provides to us. Therefore, this chapter will focus on the goals targeted at the conservation of natural resources and therefore address some of the most important environmental challenges. These include ensuring that farmers around the world follow sustainable agricultural practices, water resources are being managed sustainably, sustainable energy sources are available for use, sustainable management of marine and forest resources, and combating climate change. To incorporate sustainability in dealing with environmental challenges, we need to switch to a green chemistry approach of dispensing minimum hazardous waste. These include the use of enzymes in place of reagents, using renewable raw materials, etc. Along with adopting green chemistry, we also need to mitigate the already existing pollutants. Microorganisms and plants, with or without manoeuvring, are being looked upon as powerful tools for the removal of pollutants and cleaning of precious resources along with conserving them. Unlike chemical remediation methods, bioremediation is a very environment-friendly approach, leaving nearly zero toxicity behind, and is also relatively inexpensive. For example, the use of corexit in chemical remediation of oil spills leaves behind chemicals that affect life under the ocean, whereas bioremediation of oil spills has shown no potential harm to marine life [4–7] .  16.2 Sustainable management of clean water and sanitation Water is one of the most precious resources on this planet. On average, a person uses 101.5 gallons (384.22 L) of water each day [8] . Research at MIT states that consumption of water at the current pace can leave most regions of the earth water stressed by the end of 2050. Water consumption is not as big a problem as the availability of clean water. Increasing consumption and poor water cleaning facilities form a vicious loop. Every year millions of people lose their lives to diseases associated with diarrhoeal conditions caused due to poor drinking water and sanitation facilities. By the end of 2030, the UN partner countries are resolute to provide universal access to clean and safe drinking water and sanitation. They aim to end open defecation across the world. In order to provide safe water facilities, strict monitoring and regulation of waste disposal by industries needs to be done. For this, norms for minimal discharge of hazardous industrial waste need to be laid and strictly implemented. Water use across countries should be made judicious and efficient. To ensure an adequate supply of fresh water, the maintenance of freshwater ecosystem elements, namely, mountains, wetlands, forests, rivers, aquifers, etc., needs to be  done [9,10] . Developing countries need to focus on water harvesting for capacity building, the development of desalination technologies, and increasing efficiency and standards of wastewater treatment. All this cannot be done by governments alone. Local communities need to be made aware and sensitized towards water management [11] .  16.3 Ensuring access to sustainable energy Access to energy is important for the growth and development of a nation. Energy is fuel for cooking, electricity, railways, cars, buses, etc. The challenge is that currently available fuel sources are either not clean (biomass combustion), limited (nuclear), or both (coal). Heart disease, lung and respiratory infection, and even death can result if the cooking fuel emits soot. According to research done in 2016, around 39% of homes are still devoid of clean fuel for cooking. To solve these issues, the world needs to look for renewable and clean sources of energy. Solar energy is one such source. Other examples include wind energy where turbines move due to wind and drive generators. The electricity thus produced is fed into grids. Similarly, the turbine can be moved using water made to fall from a height in a dam. The electricity generated this way is referred to as hydroelectricity. The heat from beneath the earth's surface can also be used to move the turbine. The electricity thus produced is called geothermal energy. Biomass is also relatively clean keeping in mind that the carbon dioxide being consumed by the plant during its lifetime is nearly equivalent to what it produces when combusted. Therefore, it is a carbon-neutral source of energy. The United Nations aims to ensure universal access to affordable, clean and renewable energy by the end of 2030. The current share of these clean and renewable energy resources in the global mix is only 15%. This needs to be increased substantially by the end of 2030. Before we look into alternative sources of energy, it is important that each and everyone has access to energy and that the current technology is optimized. To achieve this, first, electricity delivery to poor or underdeveloped countries needs to be accelerated as 13% of the world’s population is still devoid of electricity. Secondly, energy efficiency needs to be increased, and lastly, clean, safe and renewable sources of energy need to be explored as around 3 billion people rely on high carbon-emitting sources like wood, coal, charcoal and animal wastes for cooking fuel requirements. These fuels emit harmful greenhouse gases that can be fatal when inhaled excessively. In 2012, around 4.3 million deaths were reported due to respiratory failure associated with the inhalation of these gases. Since most women and girls work in household kitchens, 6 out of 10 deaths were of women or girls. The world is slowly switching to cleaner and renewable sources of energy. These include solar energy, wind energy, hydroelectricity, geothermal energy, etc. Each of these sources has its own advantages and disadvantages. While one can harvest infinite energy from the sun, the capital investment required is quite high. Also, not every place on the planet receives enough sunlight for the generation of the required electricity. Similarly, for wind energy, a huge mass of land is required for the installation of huge windmills. Also, sufficient wind velocity needs to be there to rotate the windmill and therefore the turbines for electricity generation. This comes up as a limitation for not being able to use wind  energy in places with no or less wind and with low land availability. For hydroelectricity generation, huge dams need to be built so that water falls from a height that is high enough to make the turbine rotate at a high speed for energy generation. Despite these limitations, the above-mentioned sources of energy are clean and renewable. Therefore, if we can overcome the aforementioned challenges, we should definitely switch to these sources. From 2012 to 2016 the share of these renewable natural energy sources in the total energy generation pool increased by 0.24% to reach a total of 17.5%. This has been made possible due to rapid advancement and growth in solar, wind and hydropower energy harvesting technologies. 16.3.1 Building sustainable chemistry to combat climate change In past, water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide were the four major naturally occurring greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere [12,13]  of which optimum levels of carbon dioxide contributed as fuels to lush growth and stored in the form of fossil fuels. However, in this industrial era, the percentage of carbon dioxide has increased resulting in the long trapping of carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere making the Earth warmer. Methane is released naturally under the sea beds in the form of methane hydrates and reaches the surface in the form of atmospheric methane, thereby mixing with other greenhouse gases. Nitrous oxides are usually produced by vehicles, burning of fossil fuels and during agricultural practices. Being long-lived, nitrous oxide also contributes significantly to global warming [14,15] . Here is the evidence of climate change challenges faced globally.• The Agassiz Glaciers in Montana and Pasterze Glaciers in Austria melting rapidly are being observed using remote sensing kits by researchers who found that there is a considerable reduction in their surface area since the 19th century [16,17] .  • The ice core data from Antarctica and Greenland comparing the variation in temperature due to the high rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels help scientists to estimate accurately from centuries ago.  • Tree-Ring Data Bank provides sufficient studies on climate change. Variations in the measurement of full ring widths of trees and the nature of primary wood and new growth rings show a warming trend in recent investigations.  • The European butterflies are becoming extinct indicating the climatic risk of a 4°C rise, the British birds found migrating towards the north by an average of 19 km, and abnormal flowering of plants at Arnold Arboretum are the predominant signs of startling climate changes.  • The first-ever red warning due to remarkable heat forecasted by the UK researchers, increased water demand, a threat to food safety related to heat waves, droughts and other social issues, disappearance of global heritage sites across Europe, alter in bird colouration—are all due to rapid climate change.  • Global warnings in Spain as the rate of warming have hastened over the years and France being vulnerable to climate change impact with an increase in temperature, risk of heat radiations, extreme rainfall, floods and severe storms have set a firm policy of a net-zero carbon by 2050.   • Due to the rapidly growing population and huge dependence on fossil fuels, the climate change estimation report of India discovered that there is an expected temperature rise of 4°C by 2100.  • Reporters in 2021 confirmed that China is presently the world’s chief emitter of greenhouse gases and is posing threat to climate change.  • The wildfires in Australia, California and Spain were declared among the worst catastrophes in modern climate threats.    Climate Action—SDG 13—a call for crucial action not only to fight climate change and its consequences but also to build tolerance towards climate-related calamities (Table 16.1  ). In 2021, a lot of measures were taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions towards limiting global warming by 2030 and reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The COVID-19 [18]  epidemic considerably decreased human activities in 2020 and 2021 leading to a decrease in GHG emissions by 4%. But as soon as the world improved from the pandemic situation, emissions rose higher than expected and yet again led to challenging tasks for all the researchers towards carbon neutrality. It’s time for every individual to take precautions and adjust to the changing climate which is evident in the form of heat waves, sudden cyclones, droughts, floods, etc. Developed countries should render maximum financial support to developing countries to attain a low-emission and climate-resilient future directed through Green Climate Fund (Table 16.2  ). The sustainable green chemistry [19]  approach will pave the way to take critical action to battle climate change with significant strategies like the establishment of the scientific basis for sustainable management, inculcating scientific understanding among the young buddies and researchers, introducing long-term scientific questionnaires and surveys and structuring up scientific aptitude and competency. Effective utilization of GHGs for the synthesis of novel green material, including carbon dioxide in catalytic reactions, electrochemical, photoelectrochemical and biological conversions of GHGs into synthetic fuels, organic useful and green products and collaboration of sustainable chemists with climate scientists would upkeep the future of the planet Earth to attain net-zero carbon emissions by 2100 [20] .  16.3.2 Building a sustainable ecosystem on land The United Nations defines Sustainable Land Management (SLM) as using the present land resources to fulfil human needs while ensuring their long-term productive potential for future generations. Integral landscape management, natural resource management, soil management and water management are part of sustainable land management. Ideal sustainable land management helps maximal economic and social utilization of land along with supporting the land ecologically. The interaction of climate, human activities and land resources determines land management, use and productivity. A few significant principles may help in achieving holistic management of land. These include incentivizing locals to use land resources for profit in return for taking care of the available resources. For example, there are certain regions in the forest that are designated as buffer zones. It is in these regions that locals and abiotic and biotic components of the land ecosystem live in harmony. The locals can take care of the resources and are entitled to use them in order to   make money. Stakeholders at multiple levels: the land users, technical experts and policymakers should work together for the sustainable management of land. At the level of farmers, practices like the use of natural predators instead of pesticides can help maintain the ecosystem harmony along with keeping the land and water table free from pollution. This way the integrated approach involving multiple strategies should be used to achieve SLM.  16.3.3 Building a sustainable ecosystem in the water Water is one of the most precious resources on this planet. One cannot imagine life without water. Water is used everywhere: from everyday chores like bathing, washing, etc. to industries that use water as a raw material or coolant, for irrigation of crops, and most importantly for drinking. There is no alternative to water. The rate at which we consume water is way more than the rate at which our treatment plants can clean it for reuse. This way ends up degrading water quality with use. This can, in the future, lead to an increase in cases of water-borne diseases. These can be fairly dealt with if we increase the efficiency of wastewater treatment plants. One can do this by upgrading the techniques and technologies being used by a plant. But despite all the technological advancements applied, one cannot treat water beyond a limit. Therefore, water conservation is something that should always be followed. There are several ways that we can conserve water. Both of the strategies adopted together can help maintain sustainable water management. A sustainable ecosystem can be maintained in the water bodies if certain principles are followed. These include no regulated discharge of chemicals in the water bodies, rainwater harvesting for the creation of more water bodies, using drip irrigation if possible, and using organic insecticides and pesticides so that the water table is not polluted. Also, practices like not fishing during monsoons or around the time when the aquatic animals breed can help maintain and enrich the species’ richness and diversity.  16.3.4 Ensuring the availability of cleaner fuel choices Apart from electricity-generating sources, we should also start looking into cleaner petroleum alternatives. Biofuels can provide us with a cleaner alternative. Essentially biofuels are liquid or gaseous fuels made from biomass. Wood, biogas, ethanol and biodiesel are a few examples of biofuels. Unlike petroleum products, biofuels are biodegradable. Based on the feedstock and production process, biofuels are divided into first generation, second generation and third generation biofuels (Table 16.3  ).   16.3.5 Building next-generation energy sources 16.3.5.1 Next-generation fuels Hydrogen technology [21]  involves the transformation of hydrocarbon-based power generation into hydrogen-based energy production. The new innovative next-generation hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (HFCEVs) would be a feasible substitute for the overall fuel problems faced by the world. When hydrogen gas is mixed with air, the chemical energy released could produce approximately 60% efficient electrical energy. These hydrogen-powered electric vehicles could drive about 600 km with zero carbon emissions in the future. “Hydrogen economy” refers to the consumption of hydrogen gas as a commercial fuel and made available for hydrogen technology abiding by government plans and policies. The solar-powered water electrolysis plants, the establishment of hydrogen refuelling stations, the development of the infrastructure of hydrogen stations, the manufacture of HFCEVs in enormous quantities, government investments, etc. are the signs of electric competition with cost-effective and more efficient HFCEVs in the business market and would changeover hydrocarbon-based technology shortly [14]  (Fig. 16.1  ). In the Sultanate of Oman, green fuel developers [15]  are working towards zero-carbon green hydrogen using renewable solar and wind energy sources. Synthetic fuels made from green hydrogen would support to a larger extent in the transportation sectors. The brine from the seawater will act as the major intake for electrolysis to produce clean energy at a scale that is cost-competitive with fossil fuels significantly prioritizing the reduction in global greenhouse emissions, environmental and social considerations, financial standards and finally creating positive returns to the next-generation society [12] .  16.3.5.2 Next-generation sustainable batteries A revolution has been noticed in battery research in the last decade, especially in the development of Li-ion batteries [13] . Nowadays, several industries are working constantly to ensure battery development, technologies, lasting supply plans, maximum protection  measures in manufacturing sectors, energy competence, transportation and applications of sustainable batteries. Lithium is a common element with the chemical symbol Li. Its atomic number (Z) is 3. It is a soft, silvery-white alkali light metal. Li-ion battery [16]  is a rechargeable battery available in many different shapes and sizes. Each cell comprises the following battery materials. The carbon rod with packed lithium as the anode whereas lithium oxide is the cathode. From the anode, the lithium ions are carried by the electrolyte to the cathode and vice versa with the help of the separator. Thus, the charging or discharging of the gadgets is fully controlled by the movement of the lithium ions. The main advantages of lithium-ion batteries are tiny in size, are lighter, have remarkable energy storage, are ecofriendly and have long lifespans and hence found applications in health care devices like pacemakers, wearable biosensors, surgical tools, gastric stimulators and medical device monitors. Metal-air batteries [17] , the better performance with greater energy storage capacity, are completely safe, cheap and mechanically rechargeable with a longer lifetime. More research projects are in progress to resolve the unwanted crystal growth which decreases the efficiency of these batteries. Overcoming this issue, metal-air batteries could provide a better battery source for electric vehicles in place of the present gasoline and diesel (Fig. 16.2  ). In Oman, the support for secure recycling of lead-acid batteries by green chemists to protect the environment for a better world today and in the future. These batteries will be recycled into sustainable products thereby conserving nature for next-generation humanity [12] .  16.3.5.3 Next-generation waste-to-recyclates Generally, the rotor blades of wind turbines are made of fibre-reinforced plastics (FRPs) which cannot be recycled easily. This leads to an enormous global environmental problem and the accumulation of total waste resources. Blade recycling [14]  is a top priority for the  wind energy production industries. Though lighter and longer wind turbine blades made from FRP materials show a considerable performance of wind energy production globally, the landfilling of these blades has led to extreme environmental discussions in the present era. The introduction of patented low-cost agglomeration technology to employ recycled FRP wastes [22]  obtained from wood wastes, plastics Polyethylene (PE) or Polypropylene (PP) wastes, glass FRP wastes and additives through various processes like shredding, re-grinding and compounding. The eco-bulk composite panels become stronger, stiffer and more cost-effective as compared to traditional non-recyclable FRPs [23]  (Fig. 16.3  ). In Oman [24] , an investigation is in progress on the existing recycling methods of rotor blades through co-processing in the cement industry which is the only economical option at present for handling large amounts of waste materials. The End-of-Life (EoL) wind turbine blades could be recycled by three major practices—mechanical recycling, thermal recycling and chemical recycling. Chemical recycling involves the processes like solvolysis and high voltage pulse fragmentation. In solvolysis, a suitable solvent (water, alcohol or acid) could break down the crosslinked polymers into recovered FRPs under appropriate temperature and pressure conditions, without much alteration of their properties and obtain viable by-products. In high voltage pulse fragmentation, pressure waves are created that induce fragmentation of thermoset composites into useful next-generation recyclates.  16.3.5.4 Next-generation green catalysts Green catalysts [25]  are recoverable chemical substances or easily prepared from readily available substrates that generally lower the activation energy and improve the reaction rates. The conversion of biomass into biogas energy production is facilitated by an enzyme keratinase produced during its fermentation (Fig. 16.4  ).  The keratinase [18]  acts as a biodecomposer that involves biomass waste degradation followed by hydrolysation resulting in fractionation into feasible products along with biogas energy production. Table 16.4   represents the list of green catalysts and their specific applications for green energy production.  In Oman, biofuels [19]  researchers are in progress with projects that involve the conversion of huge tons of biomass into useful green products. The teamwork of experts from nationwide laboratories, research organizations and manufacturing sectors is crucial to moving biofuel energy production technologies into the marketplace. The government plans and policies are keen on the production of various wide-reaching biofuels which are listed in Table 16.5  . Biofuels ensure more promising fuel transport at the hard time of declining oil fields worldwide to safeguard the next-generation demands.  16.3.5.5 Next-generation green ammonia The real answer to more sustainable green energy production is “green ammonia synthesis” [20]  to reach net-zero carbon emissions. Mostly, agricultural wastes may contain a high percentage of nitrogen content which could be used for ammonia production. Even though during ammonia production, there is a substantial release of greenhouse gases, keeping in mind to tackle the global carbon challenge, research on green ammonia production agrees internationally to get reasonable and cost-effective clean energy shortly. The availability of almost 78% of the nitrogen in the atmospheric air triggers green chemists to produce green ammonia without the use of coal and petroleum. Finally, the  production is carbon-free ammonia and the result is the major raw material for green fertilizers [26,27] . In the Sultanate of Oman, green ammonia is the most competitive technology, with small-scale plant establishment, high reliability, reduction in carbon footprints, and collaboration of electrolysis of water with existing nitric acid and urea technologies. Overall, green ammonia [28]  producers are still working significantly on high yields with minimum functioning expenses (Fig. 16.5  ).    16.4 Bioremediation and phytoremediation Bioremediation is essentially making use of living organisms for the removal of pollutants and toxins. The living organisms are usually bacteria and microbes which are used with or without encapsulation. The normal metabolism of these microbes is generally the trait that is exploited. The pollutants in this case act as the carbon source for the microbes. The microbe acts on them to convert or digest the waste to its simpler forms. Also, sometimes these microbes are armed with certain specific genes to digest pollutants that may  not be a part of their normal metabolism. It is then that recombinant DNA technology comes into play. At some site in the microbial plasmid or genomic DNA the degrading gene is inserted. The recombinants are selected and left at the site where toxins or pollutants are accumulated. The microbe now easily acts upon the pollutant and degrades it. This site could be a landfill site where lots of garbage has accumulated over years and a part of it has never degraded. It could also be the effluent sites of various industries like textile, leather, etc. that release harmful non-degradable substances into the environment. This problem especially persists with the dyes used in textile industries. The aromatic dyes don’t degrade beyond a point and have become a major pollutant of surrounding water bodies. Microbes can be encapsulated and left in these water bodies for curation. Bioremediation is of three types, namely biostimulation, intrinsic bioremediation and bioaugmentation. In biostimulation, the microbes in their natural habitat are used to clean up their immediate surroundings. These microbes are supported by providing nutrient media from outside which can help stimulate their growth. In bioaugmentation, on the other hand, microbes from outside are introduced at a site for cleanup. In places where leaks are difficult to detect or underground spots, the remediation that is employed is referred to as intrinsic bioremediation. Bioremediation is done either in situ, that is, at the contamination site or ex situ, that is, when contaminated material is moved from the contamination site to the treatment site. Phytoremediation is another technique that can be used for similar purposes. Phytoremediation is defined as the use of green plants for the removal of toxins and pollutants from the environment. An extended definition of phytoremediation employs the microbes associated with the plant along with the plant for the removal of pollutants. Plants like Cannabis sativa  and populus are accumulators of heavy metals in soil [29] . Another example of phytoremediation could be the use of agricultural wastes like sugarcane bagasse, orange peels, etc. in the absorption of dyes and heavy metal wastes in water. This way we could not only treat the polluted water, but also effectively manage agricultural waste that could otherwise land in a dumping site. 16.4.1 Advantages of bioremediation and phytoremediation The usage of easily cultural microbes and aggressively growing plants (or low maintenance species) for the removal of wastes has proven to be cost-effective over other techniques. These techniques are environmentally friendly and help in effective waste management and remediation. The plants grown as hyperaccumulators for the removal of toxins and wastes can be further used for biofuel production. For example, sorghum accumulates phosphorus and can be converted to a biofuel intermediate thereafter by pyrolysis-gas chromatography. Bioremediation and/or phytoremediation can also be used to clean up petroleum products. Farms using excessive chemical pesticides and insecticides can make use of bioremediation strategies for maintaining a sustainable ecosystem. Also, the lumber processing plants make use of wood preservatives which leach into groundwater and soil thereby polluting them. Bioremediation can be employed at these sites for pollution control. With zero side effects, bioremediation and phytoremediation stand as the safest, clean and minimally invasive waste treatment strategies. No large and not many equipment are required to carry out the processes. Little or no energy is  consumed in these processes as compared to incineration. Public acceptance of such techniques is high as they are purely organic and involve no disturbance. Using in situ bioremediation offers the advantage of not moving the contaminated material from the contamination site to some treatment site. Also, mostly these remediation strategies offer the advantage of complete destruction or conversion of a harmful substance to a harmless substance. This means that no further treatment needs to be administered [30,31] .   16.5 Application of biotechnology in achieving Sustainable Development Goals and mitigating environmental challenges Biotechnology is a branch of science that makes use of living organisms and products of living organisms to achieve the desired objective. In each of the SDGs, biotechnology can come up with innovative achievable solutions. Since biotechnology revolves around living organisms, the solutions offered would be clean, safe and environment-friendly. For cleaner water, biotechnology has tools like bioremediation and phytoremediation to its dispense. There are microbes that release enzymes for the digestion of harmful cenobitic wastes in the wastewater. Several biosorbents are available that can be used to adsorb heavy metals, dyes, oil, etc., from wastewater and render it clean. Similarly, biotechnology can also help in providing economical energy resources. Biomass combustion can be made cost-effective if techniques like micropropagation are used. Cleaner landmass can be rendered by the use of bio- and photoremediation. Land and water ecosystems are maintained if we use biotechnology for making innovative alternatives to chemicals. For example, in agriculture, one can incorporate insect resistant or pest-resistant genes into the crop itself so that reliance on insecticides and pesticides is decreased. Recombinant technology comes into play in strengthening the remediating properties of microbes and plants [32] . This way biotechnology has a lot to offer. Aligning resources for supporting research and development in the field of biotechnology can help make SDGs more achievable and with the least harm to the environment.  16.6 Case studies A lot of researchers have done actual field work supporting various environment-friendly solutions for sustainable management of the ecosystem. One of the earliest works includes the invention of bioremediation. This was done in the 1960s by George Robinson who could experimentally suggest a microbe mix in water that was polluted by petroleum discharge in California where he worked as a petroleum engineer. It was sometime later that another scientist Dr. Anand Mohan Chakraborty filed a patent for the invention of a genetically modified organism that could clear oil spills. It was Pseudomonas putida , a hydrocarbon (especially toluene) degrading bacteria. Dr. Anand Chakraborty was awarded the Nobel prize for the same in the year 1980. It was the first ever issued bacterial patent. In the late 90s, a company named Phytotech used hemp plants for toxin removal. It planted these in several polluted sites in Ukraine, including the Chernobyl site which was  contaminated with radioactive waste. Also, the remediating action of hemp was seen in Australia, where the fields were rendered useless and contaminated due to mining activities. At around the same time, Berkheya coddii  was used in South Africa for the treatment of soil contaminated with nickel. Each plant could absorb nickel equal to 2%–3% of its dry weight. In the Al-Najah province in Saudi Arabia, it was seen that silver levels in soil decreased from 3.31 to 2.56 ppm in areas where Atriplex nummularia  was planted. Mustard or Brassica juncea  is also used as a hyperaccumulator for remediating soil with lead. Its use has also been tested for the removal of gold like heavy metals from mining sites.  16.7 Conclusion In 2015, the United Nations member countries adopted 17 SDGs, which are a blueprint for a prosperous planet, now and in the future. They aim to achieve these goals by the end of 2030. The key prospects of these goals include the conservation of the environment, building a healthy ecosystem on land and in the water, reducing inequality, providing health and education for all, dealing with climate change and accelerating economic growth. The United Nations brings out an SDG progress report each year to highlight its achievements in this direction. The latest report (June, 2022) puts forward some of the following statistics:• The global poverty has decreased from 10.1% in 2015 to 9.2% in 2020.  • Unfortunately, the number of people suffering from food insecurity is rising. This is attributed to the pandemic and the prevailing conditions of war in Ukraine.  • From 77% in 2014, now 84% of births are assisted by professionals.  • The infant mortality rate fell by 14%, from 43 deaths per 1000 live births in 2015 to 17 deaths per 1000 live births in 2020.  • The adolescent birth rate has decreased from 56 births per thousand adolescents (15–19 years of age) to 41 births per thousand adolescents.  • Deaths due to AIDS-related causes have declined by 39%.  • The incidence of tuberculosis (TB) infection is decreasing by 2% each year. Between 2018 and 2020, the treatment for TB reached 20 million people.  • The deaths related to non-communicable diseases have declined from 19.9% to 17.8%.  • The percentage of people completing upper secondary school increased from 54% in 2015 to 58% in 2020.  • From 2010 to 2020, the number of households gaining access to electricity has increased by 8% (from 83% to 91%).  • The forest cover area fell from 31.9% in 2000 to 31.2% in 2020.  • The global homicide has declined by 5.2%.
