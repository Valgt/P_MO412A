               Following introductory remarks on sustainable development goals (SDGs), the chapter presents the structure, characteristics, and necessity of the plant factory with artificial lighting (PFAL), which is thermally well insulated and highly airtight, and compares PFAL cultivation with greenhouse and open-field cultivation. The chapter also discusses the potential contribution of PFALs to the achievement of the 17 SDGs in relation to the fundamental characteristics of PFALs with high use efficiencies of land area, water, CO2, and fertilizer as well as labor-saving, pesticide-free, weather impact–free, high productivity, and local production for local consumption aspects of PFALs. The full use of the Internet and user-friendly smartphone technologies are essential for learning about and efficiently controlling the PFAL crop environment and production. Utilization of renewable energy such as solar radiation and wind power for natural resource saving and minimization of waste generation (e.g., plant residue, wastewater, and waste heat energy) for conservation of the environment are critical to sustainably maximizing productivity. The advantages of the PFAL mentioned above can be realized by fully exploiting the latest advances in technologies and basic science and technology.

Figure 4.1 The PFAL can contribute to achieving the SDGs by solving the four global and local issues in an environment characterized by (1) a declining agricultural population with aging farmers, (2) growing urban populations, (3) increasing demands for higher quality food and lifestyle, and (4) changing global and local climates. ESD and ESG denote, respectively, education for sustainable development, and environment, society, and corporate governance.    Figure 4.2 Six main components of the PFAL cultivation room.    Figure 4.3 Exterior view of mini-PFALs for personal or family use.    Figure 4.4 A medium-sized PFAL with 10 tiers for daily production capacity of 250 kg (leaf lettuce). Total floor area: 404 m2 , Floor area of the cultivation room: 338 m2 . In addition to the changing room area (3 m by 3 m) in the photo, there is another changing room on the opposite side of the PFAL. The annual production per total floor area is (216 kg m−2  y−1  (= 250 kg d−1  x 350 d y−1 )/404 m2 ).  The photo was taken at the Kashiwa-no-ha campus of Chiba University in 2020.

The chapter also discusses the potential contribution of PFALs to the achievement of the 17 SDGs in relation to the fundamental characteristics of PFALs with high use efficiencies of land area, water, CO2 , and fertilizer as well as labor-saving, pesticide-free, weather impact–free, high productivity, and local production for local consumption aspects of PFALs. The full use of the Internet and user-friendly smartphone technologies are essential for learning about and efficiently controlling the PFAL crop environment and production. Utilization of renewable energy such as solar radiation and wind power for natural resource saving and minimization of waste generation (e.g., plant residue, wastewater, and waste heat energy) for conservation of the environment are critical to sustainably maximizing productivity. The advantages of the PFAL mentioned above can be realized by fully exploiting the latest advances in technologies and basic science and technology.   Keywords Consumption  Environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG)  Plant-derived biodegradable plastics  Sustainable development goals (SDGs)   4.1 Introduction In 2015, more than 190 world leaders committed to achieving 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) with 169 targets by the year 2030 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people can enjoy peace and prosperity (Sharma and Sobti, 2018 ; Seth and Suazo, 2019 ). In short, the 17 SDGs are aiming for: (1) No poverty, (2) No hunger, (3) Good health and well-being, (4) Quality education, (5) Gender equality, (6) Clean water and sanitation, (7) Affordable and clean energy, (8) Decent work and economic growth, (9) Industry, innovation, and infrastructure, (10) Reduced inequalities, (11) Sustainable cities and communities, (12) Responsible consumption and production, (13) Climate action, (14) Life below water, (15) Life on land, (16) Peace, justice, and strong institutions, and (17) Partnerships for the goals. Under SDG 4 (Quality education), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is responsible for improving access to quality education for sustainable development (ESD) at all levels and in all social contexts, to transform society by reorienting education and helping people develop knowledge, skills, values, and behaviors needed for sustainable development. In the investment industry and business operations, the SDGs are discussed in relation to environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) criteria. These criteria are a set of standards in a company's operations that socially conscious investors use to consider potential investments. Environmental criteria consider how a company performs as a steward of nature. Social criteria examine how a company manages relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, and the communities where it operates. Governance deals with a  company's leadership, executive remuneration, audits, internal controls, and shareholder rights (Chen, 2020 ). The outbreak of COVID-19, a pandemic which began in early 2020, will continue to affect all aspects of the SDGs, ESD, and ESG, and poses a tremendous challenge for all countries in finding workable solutions (OECD, 2020 ). This chapter focuses on how the plant factory with artificial lighting (PFAL) can contribute to achieving the SDGs and related action programs and why the PFAL can be one appropriate and efficient means for achieving the SDGs in today's environment characterized by (1) a declining agricultural population with aging farmers, (2) growing urban populations, (3) increasing demands for higher quality food and lifestyle, and (4) changing global and local climates (Fig. 4.1  ). Prior to commencing the discussion of the potential contribution of PFAL to the SDGs, the chapter will present the structure, characteristics, and necessity of the PFAL in Sections 4.2 and 4.3 . Therefore, readers already familiar with PFALs can skip these sections. To maintain the independence of this chapter, the description of PFALs in Sections 4.2 and 4.3  partially overlaps with that in Chapters 2 and 8 Chapter 2  Chapter 8    .  4.2 What is a PFAL? 4.2.1 Main components and environmental control factors A PFAL is a closed plant production system, and its cultivation room consists of a thermally well-insulated, fairly airtight, and optically opaque warehouse-like structure, multitier cultivation units with light emitting diode (LED) lighting and hydroponic cultivation units, air conditioners with circulation fans, a CO2  supply unit, a nutrient solution supply unit, and an environmental control unit (Fig. 4.2  ; see Chapter 8  for more details). Environmental control factors include air temperature, photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), CO2  concentration of the room air, pH, and total ion concentration of the nutrient  solution. The air current speed, vapor pressure deficit (VPD) or relative humidity (RH) of the room air, and temperature and dissolved O2  concentration of the nutrient solution as well as the flow speed of the nutrient solution are indirectly controlled within their upper and lower limits. Since the cultivation room is highly airtight and thermally insulated, all the resource inputs and outputs to and from there can be relatively easily measured and controlled automatically. The resource input and output are not directly influenced by the weather, pest insects, and small animals outside, so the environment in the PFAL can be controlled as desired, and the use efficiency of each resource element can be estimated online based on the measured values of corresponding resource input and output (see Chapter 8  for more details). Thus, the use efficiency of each resource element and the overall resource use efficiency or productivity (or the ratio of yield to cost) can be continuously improved based on the data analyses of the measured inputs and outputs (Kozai et al., 2019a ).  4.2.2 Why are airtightness and thermal insulation required? High airtightness of the cultivation room is required to prevent (1) the invasion of viruses, microorganisms, insects with or without pathogens, small animals, dust, or the like through air gaps, and (2) the loss of CO2  and water vapor gases through air gaps to the outside. This airtightness also enhances the recycling use of CO2  and water in the cultivation room, resulting in high CO2  and water use efficiencies. Both high airtightness and thermal insulation are required to prevent (1) the impact of weather on the aerial environment of the cultivation room and (2) water condensation on the inner surfaces of walls, roof, and floor (fungi, algae, and some insects propagate and/or grow quickly on wet surfaces), and to ensure that (3) the cooling load for air conditioners or heat pumps is determined only by electricity consumption of lamps, pumps, fans, etc., regardless of weather.  4.2.3 Heating and cooling loads and electricity consumption of equipment No heating is required even on cold winter nights when more than half of the lamps are turned on, because the heat generated by the lamps is more than adequate for keeping the air  temperature of the thermally well-insulated, airtight cultivation room at around 25°C even during outside temperatures as low as −40°C. On the other hand, the cooling of the cultivation room using air conditioners is required throughout the day, and all year round when most of the lamps are turned on. Electricity consumption for cooling the thermally well-insulated, airtight cultivation room accounts for around 20% of all electricity consumption (lighting, cooling, pumping, etc.) in warmer regions and about 15% in cooler regions (Chapter 8 ; Kozai, 2013 ; Kozai et al., 2019a ). It is also important to notice that no extra electricity is required to dehumidify the room air or to keep the VPD at around 0.5 kPa or RH of 75% at 25°C if the lamps are turned on. The room air is naturally dehumidified when cooled by air conditioners to keep the room temperature at a set point.  4.2.4 Reduction in maximum electricity consumption by alternating lighting About 60%–70% of LEDs are alternately turned on all day in the cultivation room in most PFALs. In this case, air conditioners operate all day, even on cold winter nights, to remove heat energy generated by LEDs (Chapter 8 ). Under such conditions, the electricity consumption for cooling and dehumidification of the room air accounts for 15%–20% of all electricity consumption in the cultivation room, while lighting accounts for 75%–80%, and pumping, air circulation, etc., for about 5% on average annually in regions with a temperate climate. By alternating the lighting as mentioned above, the electricity consumption for lighting and cooling remains relatively consistent throughout the day. Thus, their maximum values are reduced by about 30% compared to those for all LEDs turned on for 16 h d−1  and off for 8 h d−1  at the same time, although the total amount of daily electricity consumption for lighting and cooling is the same as those for all LEDs turned on for 16 h d−1  and off for 8 h d−1  at the same time. With the same daily cooling load, the daily cost of electricity for cooling is lower at night than in daytime due to higher coefficient of performance (COP) of air conditioners at lower outdoor air temperatures at night. Then, the cooling capacity of air conditioners and the capacity of power supply units can also be reduced by about 30%, resulting in a reduction in the initial cost for air conditioners and power supply units. Besides, VPD (or RH) is kept relatively constant all day due to continuous lighting of two-thirds of LEDs and continuous cooling as well as dehumidification all day. Under highly airtight, thermally insulated, clean cultivation room conditions, about 95% of water vapor transpired from leaves in the cultivation room is condensed and collected at cooling panels of air conditioners, and then returned to the nutrient solution tank (Kozai, 2013 ; Kozai et al., 2019a ).  4.2.5 Trends in electricity costs The total electricity costs for the cultivation room with LEDs account for about 20% of the total production costs (with depreciation costs of about 30%, labor costs about 20%, logistics costs about 5%, and costs for other consumables such as fertilizer, water, seeds, CO2 , etc., of about 25%) in Japan where the cost of electricity is relatively high compared to electricity costs in other countries (Ijichi, 2018 ). When fluorescent lamps were used as the light source prior to the introduction of LEDs, lighting accounted for about 30% of costs.  It should be noted that labor costs, the electricity cost per kWh, and the reliability of the electricity supply vary according to factors such as time, country, region, and season. It must also be noted that the cost of solar panels, wind power generation, and batteries have recently been decreasing relatively rapidly (Kozai, 2018a ). In addition, electricity consumption per kg of fresh produce has been decreasing, although around 10 kWh of electricity was required to produce 1 kg of fresh leafy vegetables such as leaf lettuce until 2018.  4.2.6 Mini- and medium-sized PFALs Fig. 4.3   shows the exterior view of two mini-PFALs without a sanitation room for changing clothes, shoes, etc. As shown in the photo, mini-PFALs look like small windowless warehouses. The external placement of the air conditioning unit (lower left) may have to be changed depending on the climate where the PFAL is located and its purpose of use. The unit can also be placed on the roof or at a height of around 1.5 m rather than on the ground. The air emitted from the outer unit (i.e., condenser) is around 40°C during cooling operation, so the warm air can be used for drying/warming anything by placing it with caution around 1 m from the outer unit. A mini-PFAL can be placed either inside or outside a building. When a mini-PFAL is placed outdoors under sunlight, a hood or a shade over it may be necessary to avoid heat from strong solar radiation, strong wind/sandstorm, and/or heavy rain/snowfall. When the PFAL is used to produce pesticide- and insect-free transplants, it is covered with an insect screen or placed in an insect-screen net house. In this case, the sanitary room described below is not necessarily required. A small sanitary room or front room (e.g., 1.5 × 1.5 × 2.5 m) for handwashing and changing from everyday clothing to disinfected or clean clothing needs to be attached to the cultivation room of the mini-PFAL when it is used for the production of vegetables to be served fresh without washing. In this case, the produce is packed in clean bags and then sealed in a clean space such as the cultivation room. If possible, the bags are placed in a heat-insulating box before taking it out from the sanitary room. Fig. 4.4      shows an exterior view of a medium-sized PFAL with 10 tiers and a daily production capacity of 250 kg (leaf lettuce). The total floor area is about 400 m2  and the floor area of the cultivation room is about 300 m2 . In addition to the changing room area (3 m by 3 m) in  the photo, there is another changing room on the opposite side of the PFAL. The annual production per total floor area is 216 kg m−2  y−1  (= 250 kg d−1  x 350 d y−1 )/404 m2 .  4.2.7 Hygiene management of hydroponic cultivation system Population density of microorganisms is often more than 1000 times higher in the cultivation beds than in the room air because the microorganisms are fed by dead and alive roots, algae, and other organic substances in the cultivation beds (algae grow photosynthetically only under the presence of light, water, and nutrients). Thus, falling down of nutrient solution droplets from the roots to the plant leaves needs to be strictly avoided to keep them clean. Microorganism colony-forming units (CFUs) are generally controlled below 300 per gram of produce fresh weight. No pesticide, insecticide, and bactericide are used during cultivation, so harvests can be used as fresh salad without washing before serving. The nutrient solution is circulated to minimize amount of drainage in most hydroponic systems. Although sterilization and/or filtering units are placed in the middle of the nutrient solution recirculation pipe, the population density in the cultivation beds is not decreased significantly because a significant portion of the microorganisms and algae tend to stay on the inner surface of the cultivation beds and the roots of plants. Hygiene management pertains to controlling population densities of unsanitary and/or unpleasant insects, algae, small animals, etc. The invasion of small flying insects, dust, or other foreign substances can be efficiently blocked by keeping the room air pressure slightly (3-5 Pa) higher than outdoor air pressure. In most hydroponic cultivation systems, inorganic fertilizers only are used to minimize the population density of microorganisms (organic fertilizer is used after its decomposition to  inorganic fertilizer through the use of microorganisms in a separate unit). It is desirable to measure and control each of major ion concentrations, although the measurements of PO4 , NH4 + , etc., using chemical sensors are difficult at present.   4.3 Why is the PFAL necessary? 4.3.1 Use of solar radiation is not free of charge! A greenhouse is often installed with environmental control units to improve the annual yield and quality of produce and the environment of workers. To use ‘free’ solar energy, extra initial costs are required for shading screen, thermal screen, insect screen, natural or forced ventilators, units for heating/evaporative-cooling, supplemental lighting, etc. Consumption goods necessary in the greenhouse but unnecessary in the PFAL include oil or natural gas for heating, pesticide/herbicide, etc. The main reason for these extra initial operation costs aimed at taking advantage of the ‘free’ solar energy is that the solar radiation (waveband: about 350–2500 nm at sea level) and outside air temperature are often too high or too low depending on the time of day, season, weather, and geographical location. The ever-changing solar radiation and outside air temperature make it difficult to control the greenhouse environment optimally, resulting in variations in the yield and quality of produce. In addition, only about 50% of solar radiation is photosynthetically active (wavelength: 400–700 nm). Radiation with wavelengths of 700–800 nm is physiologically active (has photomorphological effects) but is photosynthetically inactive, and with 800–2500 nm simply increases the air and leaf temperatures inside the greenhouse. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the cost performance of the PFAL can be higher than that of the greenhouse for selected plant species for a particular purpose of production. This hypothesis has recently been proved for leafy vegetables by researchers and business people in many countries. However, as of 2021, commercial production of fruit vegetables, root vegetables, head vegetables, and medicinal plants is profitable only in a limited number of PFALs. In view of these conditions, there have been efforts to step up PFAL research, development, and business to achieve innovations in PFAL technology considering that: (1) recent advances in smart technology are remarkable, and (2) costs of batteries and electricity generated by natural energy such as solar radiation and wind power have been decreasing.  4.3.2 Comparisons of yield, cost, and cost performance In general, both the average yield (production per land area) and the initial/operation costs per land area of leafy vegetables in the PFAL are more than 100-fold those of the open field and more than 10-fold those of the greenhouse. Thus, the monetary productivities or cost performances (annual sales divided by annual production costs including depreciation costs) of the PFAL, the greenhouse, and the open field are more or less the same if their unit sales prices per kg of produce are the same (Kozai et al., 2019a ). The ratios of annual sales to the initial investment on the PFAL, the greenhouse, and the open field are also more or less the same.   4.3.3 Factors affecting cost performance In reality, the yield at a given location is considerably affected by the skills of the production manager of the PFAL, the greenhouse, and the open field. The yields in the open field and the greenhouse are also affected by the weather and climate, while the yield in the PFAL is not affected by these factors at all. The high yield in the PFAL is mainly due to: (1) year-round production (longer total cultivation periods per year); (2) use of multitiers; (3) shortened cultivation periods or enhanced growth due to an optimal environment throughout the cultivation period; and (4) no reduction in the yield due to pathogenic diseases, insects, or disastrous weather events such as typhoons (Kozai, 2019 ; Kozai et al., 2019b ). The sales price per kg of PFAL-grown, pesticide-free, and high-quality produce is often 10%–50% higher than that of greenhouse- and open-field-grown produce.  4.3.4 Relative resource consumption per kg of fresh produce Table 4.1   shows roughly estimated relative resource consumption of components per kg of produce of the PFAL compared to consumption by the greenhouse and the open field (Kozai, 2018b , 2019 ). The total production cost per kg of produce, CT , is expressed by the total sum of a product of the consumed resource component ‘i’ for 1 kg of produce, Qi , and the unit cost of resource component ‘i’, Ci . Namely, CT  = Σ(Qi  х Ci ) (i = 1–10). The productivity or the cost performance is expressed by Y/CT  where Y is the yield (see Chapters 12 and 13 Chapter 12  Chapter 13    ). The resource consumption of the respective components per kg of produce needs to be estimated for the particular product, location, season, etc., when this method is applied. (1) Land area:  Annual yield (production per land area) of the PFAL with 10 tiers is roughly 10-fold and 100-fold that of the greenhouse and the open field, respectively, in a temperate climate area (Kozai et al., 2019a ). In other word, land area required for production of 1 ton of plants by the PFAL is about 1/100th compared to open fields, and 1/10th compared to greenhouses. Thus, we need ‘1 ha of PFAL’ only instead of 100 ha of open field for vegetable production.  (2) Water for irrigation : About 95% of transpired water vapor from leaves is recycled for irrigation in the PFAL (Chapter 8 ). This reduction in water consumption is a significant advantage of the PFAL over the greenhouse and open field where the available water is scarce and/or the water quality is not suitable for irrigation. Furthermore, a significant portion of irrigated water is evaporated from the soil surface and/or drained from the soil of greenhouse and the open field, while the amount of such water loss in the PFAL can be minimized. An extra amount of water is required in a greenhouse with an evaporative cooling unit.  (3) Water for washing/cleaning:  Water consumption for washing the PFAL-grown produce before cooking or service is less than 1/10th compared to greenhouse- and open-field-grown vegetables because PFAL-grown vegetables are clean (free from pesticide, insects, and other foreign substances), and the population density of microorganisms on leaves is 1/1000th to 1/100th of field-grown vegetables.  (4) Fertilizer : With use of hydroponic cultivation system in the PFAL, application amount of P/N/K fertilizer per kg of produce is reduced by more than half compared to open field. In the greenhouse and the open field, both organic and inorganic fertilizers can be used. On the other hand, around 50% of fertilizer is often leached/drained away and/or adsorbed to the soil in the greenhouse and the open field.  (5) Working hours : The distance traveled on foot and by vehicle per kg of produce of workers is much shorter with the PFAL than with the greenhouse and the open field. Working hours per kg of produce are assumed to be shorter in the open field than in the greenhouse since vehicles are used for the most part in various operations in the open field.  (6) Electricity : Electricity is mostly consumed for lighting and air conditioning in the PFAL. In the greenhouse, electricity is used mainly for ventilation, pumping, heating/cooling, and battery-driven vehicles. All machines/vehicles are driven using electricity only both in the PFAL and greenhouse. Battery-driven agricultural machines are used in some cases in the open field.  (7) CO 2  : In most cases, pure liquid CO2  contained in a high-pressure cylinder-type container (30–70 kg of CO2 ; 0.5–0.8 US$ per kg in Japan) is supplied during the photoperiod in the PFAL to keep its concentration at around 1000 μmol mol−1  to promote photosynthesis and thus the growth of plants. Only about 10% of CO2  is released to the outside in the fairly airtight PFAL, while about 50%–60% of CO2  is released to the outside through air gaps of a CO2 -enriched greenhouse with all windows closed. CO2  is free of charge in the open field but its concentration is always around 400 μmol mol−1 . CO2  is a by-product obtained from a chemical plant using fossil fuel. CO2  is also a by-product of the respiration of living organisms, so CO2  produced by fungus/microorganisms, fish, animal/livestock, humans, etc., can be used as a CO2  source for plant photosynthesis if it is collected efficiently.   (8) Fossil fuels  (natural gas, gasoline, and heavy oil): No heating is required in the PFAL even on cold winter nights, while fossil fuels are used mostly for heating in the greenhouse on cold days, and for the operation of agricultural machinery in the open field.  (9) Seeds : The ratio of seeds grown to marketable plants is 10%–20% higher in the PFAL than in the greenhouse and open field due to the higher germination ratio (over 98%), higher growth uniformity, and no damage to plants by insects in the PFAL.  (10) Space use efficiency:  The ratio of the total cultivation bed area to floor area (m2  m−2 ) or ratio of total cultivation space (m3 ) to cultivation room space (m3 ) (m3  m−3 ) can be maximized as far as there are no known negative effects on plant growth and workability, and to minimize the area of empty cultivation beds to maximize PFAL productivity  (11) Food mileage and food loss:  Food mileage is minimum when the food is produced at consumption sites (local production for local consumption), and thus simple and lightweight package materials can be used. Long-distance vehicle traffic causing fuel consumption, CO2  emission, air pollution, and damage of highways is reduced. Food loss during transportation is minimum when food mileage is minimum, especially when plants are produced in a clean and controlled environment in the PFAL. Global loss and waste of field-grown fruit and vegetables are, respectively, 13% in calories and 44% in fresh weight (Lipinski et al., 2013 ).     4.3.5 Obstacles and risks Obstacles to popularize PFALs for SDGs, as of 2021, are lack of human resource development program and friendly smartphone-based software for e-learning and online training systems. One hundred-hour on-site or online interactive course with practical and classroom training is desirable to train beginners, and 200-h course to train skilled PFAL managers and workers. Skills required for PFAL management are considerably different from those for plant production in the greenhouse and open fields. The PFAL manager requires the knowledge and experience of the plant production under sanitary condition, and of environmental control and its effects on plant growth and quality of produce with respect to CO2  concentration, air current speed, light quality, PPFD, nutrient solution for hydroponic cultivation, etc., because environments, resource consumption, and plant growth are monitored and partially controlled using a smartphone. Also, the PFAL manager requires skills for managing various risks, personnel, production, resource, and logistics, with use of support software. A fail-safe and alarm system is a must for power breakdown; a fire; malfunction of equipment for water supply, CO2 , etc.; spread of insects and disease; and a theft. A battery backup system is necessary for a water pump to provide a minimum amount of water irrigation during power failure. The aforementioned software needs to be downloadable via the Internet to a user's smartphone as an application software with free of charge or a minimum charge, preferably supported by a public international organization. Special interest groups organized by PFAL users and their supporters would be helpful to skill up each other.    4.4 Sustainable development goals 4.4.1 Goal 1: end poverty in all its forms everywhere A PFAL with a hydroponic cultivation system can be built and used efficiently anywhere in the world—in hot, cold, dry, and wet regions with nonfertile soils—to produce high-quality functional plants such as leaf lettuce plants and herbs such as basil all year round, as well as for producing high-quality transplants (seedlings, micropropagated plantlets, and grafted transplants) regardless of weather, using minimum land/floor area and other resources such as water and fertilizer. Over the past decade there have been various initiatives to commercially produce in PFALs root vegetables such as mini-carrots, mini-turnips, and mini-radishes; fruit vegetables such as strawberries and cherry tomatoes; and some medicinal plants and ornamental plants but only a limited number of PFALs are currently making a profit as of 2021. Staple crops such as wheat, rice, and maize can also be grown in PFALs relatively easily for research, educational, and recreational purposes, but the cost performance (ratio of its economic value of produce to production costs) for these is too low to be economical and practical. Nonprofit or public-supported microfinancing organizations could lease to farmers and other interested parties mini-PFALs with a floor area of 3–20 m2  or funds to rent mini-PFALs to start a small personal, family, or group business to help end poverty. The annual yield of leaf lettuce in a mini-PFAL with four tiers is about 85 kg m−2  (floor area) y−1  and 213 kg m−2  y−1  (= 85 kg m−2  y−1  x 10/4) in a PFAL with 10 tiers if operated by a skillful professional grower, regardless of the weather; however, the yield would probably be around 10–20 kg m−2  if operated by a beginner. Thus, well-organized, remote on-site training is essential for improving skills in PFAL management. The initial investment cost of a PFAL per unit floor area is about 10 times higher than that of a greenhouse with environment control units, and is around 100 times higher than that of an open field equipped with irrigation systems and standard cultivation machinery. However, the initial investment cost per kg of produce for PFAL, greenhouse, and open field is almost the same because the average annual yield per unit land area of the PFAL is around 10-fold and 100-fold higher than the greenhouse and the open field, respectively. The basic unit of a scalable PFAL is called a cultivation system module (CSM), with a floor area of around 10–2100 m2  (Kozai, 2018a ). Using multiple CSMs, a PFAL can be scaled up to any size. This scalable characteristic using CSMs without any extra costs for scaling up can play an important role in ending poverty and improving income by increasing production capacity every 1–3 years.  4.4.2 Goal 2: end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture The mini-PFAL operated by electricity generated from renewable energy can be a sustainable plant production system contributing to ending hunger, achieving food security, and improving the nutrition of people. Operation and maintenance manuals and other necessary information on the mini-PFAL can be downloaded from an open database and a self-learning system via the Internet. The mini-PFAL can be used as a small private/family business or for  self-consumption at home or by a small community. The establishment of a nonprofit or public organization to support the introduction of mini-PFALs by providing free software and documents could be instrumental in promoting the success and widespread use of mini-PFALs. PFAL measurements, control, and maintenance can be conducted using a smartphone after downloading the corresponding software. The land area and amount of water for irrigation required for vegetable and/or seedling production are about 1/20th of the land and water required for open fields, and there is no damage to plants due to weather, pest insects, worms, or wild animals. The reason for the considerable water saving is briefly explained in Fig. 4.5  in Goal 6, and is explained in detail in Section 8.3  in Chapter 8 . The PFAL can be locked, if necessary, for security against strong winds and rains and attacks by animals and thieves (Kozai et al., 2019b ). A power failure for about 15 h would not damage the plant growth significantly provided a minimum battery unit for data collection and a water pump for irrigation are installed. A prefabricated PFAL with a floor area of 10–20 m2  composed of renewable energy–powered CSMs can be built and operated within a few months from the start of on-site work anywhere including a disaster area, thereby providing locally produced and delivered fresh, tasty, nutritious vegetables that are ready to eat (without washing). After the seeds are sown, sprouts can be harvested within 1 week, microgreens within 2 weeks, baby leaf greens within 3 weeks, and leafy greens (100 g per head) within 6 weeks when CO2  (carbon dioxide) concentration is kept at around 1000 μmol mol−1  (or ppm) to promote plant photosynthesis. Once these prefabricated CSMs are developed, the initial investment cost will be considerably reduced, and the PFAL can be scaled up easily by adding CSMs. To prevent (1) the loss of CO2  and water vapor in the room air to the outside, (2) the invasion of small insects and/or pathogens, and (3) fluctuations in air temperature and RH or VPD of the room air, the PFAL should not be ventilated to lower the room temperature even when the temperature is lower than the air temperature outside.  4.4.3 Goal 3: ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages Growing plants for food and other purposes under comfortable controlled environment is often enjoyable, provides healing effects, and generally improves the quality of life of people of all ages (Ingrid et al., 2004 ; Chapter 22  of this book; Haller and Kramer, 2006 ). Growing plants using a mini-PFAL is neither hard nor dirty work, and there is no need to weed. A mini-PFAL also provides a space for human communication in a family or local community (Kozai et al., 2019a ). The mini-PFAL is a new type of home or community garden that connects with the Internet. By using the software downloaded via social networking sites (SNSs) of the Internet, users can obtain appropriate basic knowledge on environmental set points, species, cultivars, and cultivation know-how. This approach brings to mind the proverb: Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach a man how to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.   To serve clean, fresh vegetables without the need to wash them after harvesting, careful handwashing using disinfectant and wearing disinfected overalls/protection coats, shoes/boots, caps and masks, and daily sanitary control of the cultivation room are essential. To prevent the spread of infectious diseases to humans, persons with a body temperature of higher than 37 deg. C or symptoms such as coughing or diarrhea should not work in the PFAL or handling PFAL produce. The preparation of an educational program on sanitation control for workers and other persons engaged in PFAL cultivation is essential.  4.4.4 Goal 4: ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all Growing plants in a PFAL with the support of an e-learning system will enable people to learn about basic plant physiology, ecology, recycling of water, CO2 , energy, and nutrient elements for growing plants in an integrated, simplified, and understandable form. The use of virtual PFALs (computer simulation software and peripherals) connected with a corresponding real PFAL will enable people to efficiently learn the fundamentals of PFAL science and technology for growing plants (Kozai, 2018a ). A micro-PFAL with a floor area of 0.1–0.5 m2  can be used for educational purposes or personal use as a hobby (Chapter 6  by Takagaki et al. in Kozai et al., 2020 ; Chapter 15  in this book). In this way, people can enjoy the computer simulation by virtual PFALs under different environments, management methods, and plant species/cultivars using a virtual PFAL before growing plants using actual PFALs, like a flight simulator that can be used by beginners and professionals alike. Furthermore, the experience and knowledge gained from using a PFAL help people understand the essence of more complex natural and open-field agricultural ecosystems relatively easily. On the other hand, PFAL managers need more advanced skills and deeper knowledge about controlling the environment and its effect on plant growth than farmers and growers of conventional crops under sunlight. When growing leafy vegetables under controlled environments in a PFAL, routine cultivation practices such as sowing, transplanting, harvesting, packing, etc., can be experienced every week or every month throughout the year, so that we can learn how to cultivate them well much sooner than growing them under variable environments in the open field or in the greenhouse. This characteristic is one of merits of the PFAL in education.  4.4.5 Goal 5: achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls Many people—regardless of gender or age and whether or not they have physical or mental handicaps—will be able to derive enjoyment from the light, safe work of growing plants in a comfortable, protected PFAL environment in or near their residential area and at the same time earn money from it. Most children and adults will experience less mental or physical stress when working in a PFAL than when working under uncomfortable conditions in an open field, and they will experience gender equality and empowerment during most working hours. PFAL-grown plants are provided to and consumed by local consumers of different gender, age, health status, and preferences, so producers of PFAL crops will be expected to produce a variety of crops for diverse consumers with different preferences and backgrounds simply by  adjusting the plant environment and the selection of cultivars. Since crops in PFALs are cultivated throughout the year, workers can secure full-time employment in PFALs, while many workers in open fields tend to find it difficult to secure full-time work throughout the year.  4.4.6 Goal 6: ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all As mentioned in Goal 1, about two-thirds of the lamps are always turned on in most PFALs to minimize varation in electricity consumption with time and to avoid high RH in darkness (see also Section 4.4.11  for more details), so that the highly airtight and thermally insulated cultivation room is at all times cooled by air conditioners to remove heat generated by lamps even on cold nights. As the cultivation room cools, nearly 95% of water vapor transpired from the leaves or 75%–95% of water taken up by the plants in the cultivation room is condensed (thus, dehumidified) and collected at the cooling panels (with a temperature of around 5°C) of air conditioners, and is returned to the nutrient solution tank for recycling after a proper water purification/filtering process (see Chapter 8  for further details). Fig. 4.5  shows how the water balance of the cultivation room is maintained. The net amount of water supply for irrigation is expressed as (Ws – WV  - WD  - WP ), where WP  is the water retained in plants and removed to the outside after harvesting as produce or plant residue. Thus, decreasing the WV  and the WD,  which increases WC , is essential to save water for irrigation. This large reduction of 75%–95% in net water supply for irrigation is beneficial when the PFAL is built in an arid region and/or where the quality and/or quantity of available water for irrigation is insufficient. A portion of the nutrient solution in the cultivation beds, WD , needs to be drained from time to time due to an imbalance of ion concentrations of nutrient elements. The WD  should be minimized, recycled, or reused as far as possible. The entire nutrient solution needs to be replaced with a new nutrient solution in the case of excess propagation of harmful microorganisms, pathogens, and algae. Thus, careful sanitary management of the nutrient solution and hydroponic cultivation system is necessary. Even then, however, the water and nutrient ions need to be recycled.  In addition to the water supply for irrigation, a significant amount of water is consumed for washing the floor, cultivation panels, tools, hands and boots of workers, etc. A large portion of the drained water can be reused after appropriate sanitation processing. Most pathogens (fungi, bacteria, and viruses) are disinfected or inactivated by keeping the nutrient solution at 65–80°C for about 1–10 h (the temperature and the time are species dependent (WHO (World Health Organisation), 2011 )). For seed disinfection, 50–55°C for 20–30 min is common. Wiping the empty cultivation beds and panels with a wet rag containing a disinfectant is effective in decreasing the population density of pathogens. Even when the plants absorb unclean water, they transpire clean water vapor from their leaves. Then, the condensed water at the cooling panels is as clean as distilled or drinking water if the cultivation room is hygienic and the air conditioner and its piping are kept clean through regular maintenance. It is also noted that the daily amount of transpired water per floor area in the PFAL with 5 and 10 tiers are, respectively, about 5 and 10 times that in the greenhouse with one flat cultivation bed (1 tier). Thus, the PFAL is a kind of plant-based water collection and purification system. This is the reason why PFAL-grown pesticide-free vegetables can be served as fresh salads without washing with tap water. However, the population density of microorganisms in the rootzone and nutrient solution in the cultivation beds is extremely high because organic substances such as dead roots exist and feed the microorganisms in the cultivation beds. Thus, the dripping of nutrient solution containing microorganisms to the aerial part of the plants should be strictly avoided to keep the aerial part of the plants clean.  4.4.7 Goal 7: ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all The energy-autonomous PFAL with a battery backup unit will be commercialized in the near future for use with electricity generated by solar energy, wind power, biomass, or geothermal energy since the cost of electricity generated by such renewable energies has recently become less expensive than that generated by fossil fuels and nuclear power in many regions in the world (Kozai, 2018a ), and will continue to decrease in the coming years. The downsized batteries used for electric cars need to be replaced with new ones when the electricity storage capacity decreases by around 30%. At that time, they are replaced with new ones. This means that a new market for the used downsized batteries will be created and will grow in the coming decades. By connecting these used batteries, an inexpensive battery backup system can be installed in the PFAL and many other electricity-driven systems. The reduction in storage capacity of used batteries by 30% will not cause any problem in those systems. As of 2019, electricity costs for a PFAL with LEDs accounted for about 20% of the total production cost in Japan (Kozai et al., 2019a ). The electricity consumption per kg of produce (7–10 kWh; see Chapters 12 and 13 Chapter 12  Chapter 13     in this book) will decrease by 15%–30% within several years as a result of the improvement in lighting and other environmental control systems and the introduction of new cultivars expressly bred to suit the PFAL, which grow well under high CO2  concentration, low PPFD, and pathogen-free conditions.  In the open field, solar light energy is often too abundant or too scarce for plant growth, CO2  concentration at daytime (about 400 μmol mol−1 ) is always too low to maximize the photosynthesis and thus plant growth, and the air/soil temperatures are often too low and/or too high, so that the annual average of light energy use efficiency of plants is much lower than that of PFAL-grown plants (Kozai, 2011 ). Furthermore, risks of plant damage due to drought, strong winds, and/or rain, and the spread of pest insects are high in open fields. The PFAL's protection of plants from these hazards is also beneficial for human physical and mental health. Dry air in the Earth's atmosphere contains 78.1% nitrogen (by volume), 21% (or 210,000 μmol mol−1 ) oxygen, 0.04% (or 400 μmol mol−1 ) CO2 , and small amounts of other gases. The atmospheric air also contains a variable amount of water vapor, on average around 1% at sea level. It should be noted that the low concentration of CO2 , sole carbon source of plants, is one of the key limiting factors in photosynthesis (Taiz and Zeiger, 2006 ). In the airtight PFAL containing plants, the CO2  concentration in the room air during the photoperiod decreases to around 100 μmol mol−1  within 1 h or so if CO2  supply is stopped. This is why CO2  gas needs to be supplied continuously during the photoperiod in the PFAL. In this sense, the PFAL is a CO2 -absorbing system.  4.4.8 Goal 8: promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work The productivity of advanced PFALs will more than double that of existing PFALs by 2030 (Kozai, 2018a , 2019 ) and will make a substantial contribution to employment and economic growth. It is expected that people who want to start a small business can rent a mini-PFAL and build it on a limited unfertile and/or contaminated land area with a shortage of irrigation water for producing and selling fresh vegetables, medicinal plants, and various seedlings as cash crops. Since some recent PFALs are designed to be scalable, it will be possible to expand their production capacity easily year after year (Kozai, 2018a ). As of 2021, leafy vegetables and seedlings for greenhouse production are produced in most commercial PFALs. However, a few PFALs for commercial production of fruit vegetables such as cherry tomato plants exist (see Chapter 23 ), and the number of PFALs or commercial production of strawberry and medicinal plants will increase significantly in the 2020s.  4.4.9 Goal 9: build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation PFALs can be reinforced to construct a resilient infrastructure in a local area. The infrastructure is strengthened more through integration with other systems such as wastewater treatment, bio-waste treatment, electric power supply with use of natural energy, CO2 , and heat energy recovery/delivery, all of which promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and agriculture. Food mileage and food loss are also minimized, and food security is strengthened when fresh vegetables are produced in the consumption area. An advantage of the PFAL built in residential and industrial areas is that the peak time zone of electricity consumption for lighting and cooling for the PFALs occurs between  evening and morning, while the peak time zone in residential and industrial areas often occurs between morning and evening. Furthermore, the plants in the PFAL absorb CO2 , while CO2  is emitted in the residential and industrial areas. The PFALs produce waste heat (around 40°C) from the outer units of air conditioners for cooling all day, which can be used for drying food and clothing and warming the room air. The LED lighting system, air conditioners with fans, hydroponic cultivation beds/racks with water pumps, CO2  and nutrient solution supply units, and environment controllers are major units of the cultivation room (Fig. 4.2 ). The expected life spans of such systems are 30,000–50,000 h, so they can be used for 5–10 years if maintained properly.  4.4.10 Goal 10: reduce inequality within and among countries PFALs can be built and operated anywhere, regardless of climate, soil fertility, and water availability. They can be operated commercially in cold (as low as −50°C), hot and dry (as high as 50°C and RH of as low as 10%), and hot and humid areas (around 45°C and RH of 90%), with a slight increase in electricity consumption and costs for cooling in hot areas. Annual electricity consumption for cooling the thermally insulated, airtight cultivation room accounts for 10%–15% in cold, 20%–25% in hot and dry, and 25% of costs in hot and humid areas. In other words, the COP (coefficient of performance, the ratio of the cooling load to the electricity consumption of air conditioners) of air conditioners ranges from 9 (= (85 + 5)/10) in cold to 3 (= (70 + 5)/25) in hot areas when operated properly. The COP for cooling increases in tandem with the increase in the difference between room air and outside air temperatures. The electricity consumption for lighting is the same anywhere in the world and accounts for 70%–85% of total electricity consumption (Fig. 4.6 ). The electricity consumption for pumping nutrient solution and air distribution fans accounts for around 5% of the total annual electricity consumption irrespective of the PFAL's location.  Since most aspects of PFAL technology are universal and largely open to the public, PFALs are suited to local production for local consumption. Thus, PFALs have the potential to help reduce income inequality within and among countries. A small PFAL can be built at a local community center or school. People living in remote regions often struggle to transport and sell their heavy fresh produce in large cities, resulting in a significant loss of produce during transportation. People living in cold and hot regions struggle to grow plants in greenhouses and open fields as fresh produce for economic profits due to high production costs, low yields, and the long distance to consumers. Under such conditions, they could use PFALs to grow medicinal plants/herbs and vegetables for use as dried products all year round and dry them on-site for sale as ingredients for medicine, cosmetics, seasonings, and food/drink additives before transporting them to buyers every few months when convenient.  4.4.11 Goal 11: make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable Integrating a CO2 -absorbing PFAL with a CO2 -emitting biological system such as mushroom and aquaculture facilities, or another CO2 -emitting system such as an office building can enhance the sustainability of cities (Kozai et al., 2019a ), making cities and human settlements more inclusive, resilient, sustainable, and safer. In this case, however, a method of introducing CO2  gas into the cultivation room of PFAL without causing any negative issue needs to be considered. The reason for lighting the PFAL at night, early morning, and late evening when electricity consumption in office buildings and homes is lower than in the daytime include: (1) instead of turning all LEDS on and off at the same time, lighting two-thirds of the lamps alternately throughout the day can reduce maximum hourly electricity consumption for lighting and cooling by about 30%, resulting in reduced initial investment for lighting and power supply systems and reduced electricity consumption due to increased COP of air conditioners since the air temperature outside is lower at night than in the daytime; (2) RH in the cultivation room can be kept at around 70%–80% throughout day without the use of a dehumidifier due to the dehumidifying function of air conditioners operated for cooling; and (3) plants grow well even at night if the daily light integral (PPFD x photoperiod per day) is high enough. Accordingly, the electric power network/grid can be developed in the region to share the generated electricity optimally with homes, offices, industries, businesses, and PFALs.  4.4.12 Goal 12: ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns The PFAL is suitable for scheduled production of plants from the viewpoint of both resource availability and demand for produce in the region. Thus, sustainable local production for responsible local consumption can be ensured with relative ease. Local production for local consumption minimizes the loss of produce during transportation, storage, and  handling, and prolongs shelf life due to the cleanness (low microorganism population in produce) and less physical damage of produce. Local people tend to try to minimize vegetable and food waste when they know who, how, and where they are produced. In the PFAL, historical and cultural cultivars can be produced without any technical difficulty for local people. Since the PFAL is thermally well insulated and highly airtight and the plant environment is controlled as desired, use efficiencies of electricity, water, fertilizer, and CO2  are much higher than those in the greenhouse and open field (see Kozai (2013) ; and Chapter 8  of this book). In addition, waste heat energy generated mainly by lamps and transferred to the outer units (or condensers) of air conditioners can be efficiently used for drying the plant residue or other wet substances at around 40°C, thereby improving hygienic conditions and mitigating food security risks such as local hazardous weather, pest insects, animals, and human crimes.  4.4.13 Goal 13: take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts The PFAL will reduce the negative impact of climate change on plant productivity. The plants growing in the PFAL are almost completely protected against strong wind, heavy rain, flood, drought, hail/snow, extreme temperatures, insects, animals, and thieves because the PFAL is airtight and thermally insulated and all the doors can be locked. CO2  emissions per kg of PFAL-grown produce due to electricity generation and fertilizer manufacturing have been reduced in recent years and will be further reduced in the near future. The consumption of water and fertilizer per kg of produce in the PFAL has already been significantly reduced compared with consumption in the greenhouse and open field. On the other hand, the CO2  emitted during the manufacturing of iron, cement, and aluminum used as structural components of the PFALs needs to be reduced. Likewise, the plant residue produced in PFALs as waste needs to be reduced and/or recycled on-site. Reinforced wooden structural components need to be used more for the PFAL building and cultivation racks (Kikuchi and Kanematsu, 2019 ). Biodegradable plastics and paper bags also need to be used more in cultivation trays and panels.  4.4.14 Goal 14: conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development PFALs constructed under water or underground can be more sustainable than those built above ground. PFALs can also be built on ships for providing fresh vegetables to people on board. Besides, closed-type inland aquaculture systems for producing ocean fish constructed near or in urban areas are becoming more and more resource efficient (in terms of water, electricity, feed, and labor) recently. Thus, this type of aquaculture system using food waste produced in urban areas as feed will contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas, and marine resources.  On the other hand, in aquaponics, a combination of aquaculture and hydroculture, fish waste can be used as fertilizer for plants, and the plant residue can be used to feed fish (see Chapter 10  in this book). Since both the PFAL and aquaponics are closed systems, they do not interfere with the conservation and sustainable use of oceans, seas, and marine resources. Insect factories for growing crickets (Gryllidae), earthworms, etc., are set to be commercialized for the production of fish and livestock feed.  4.4.15 Goal 15: protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss The PFAL is a powerful system for producing millions or billions of high-quality transplants or seedlings free of disease, insects, and pesticides with high resistance to environmental stresses for use in reforestation, forestation, and desert greening, with minimum use of irrigation water, land area, and labor. Thus, PFALs can play a key role in halting and reversing land degradation and biodiversity loss. In contrast, the open field and greenhouse are generally unsuited to producing millions or billions of high-quality transplants especially in areas for reforestation, forestation, and desert greening (Kozai et al., 2005 ). Transplants preacclimatized to the climate and the soil can be produced on-site in PFALs where the climate and soil are generally inappropriate for producing high-quality transplants in greenhouses and open fields. The PFAL would require only about 1%–2% of land area compared to the open field to produce such transplants (Kozai et al., 2019a ). Thus, by using PFALs rather than open fields or greenhouses for producing transplants, more land area can be used for conserving natural ecosystems with improved biodiversity, while people can use open spaces for producing fresh vegetables or for the conservation of natural ecosystems. In dry regions in particular, most of the water used for irrigation in transplant production evaporates from the soil surface without being absorbed by the transplants. On the other hand, most of the water used for irrigation in transplant production in the PFAL is absorbed by the transplants. Furthermore, transpired water from plants is mostly condensed, collected, and reused for irrigation (Fig. 4.5 ). The transplants produced in the PFAL can be stored at low temperatures and a low PPFD for a few weeks until the transplants can be transplanted under favorable environmental conditions. For details, refer to Kurata and Kozai (1992) , Kubota and Chun (2000) , and Kozai et al. (2005) .  4.4.16 Goal 16: promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels A PFAL composed of multiple CSMs is scalable or expandable with relative ease. The smallest PFAL is a CSM itself. Setting up and operating a CSM with the assistance of a self-learning or educational software tool, anyone can enjoy learning about plant physiology, energy and material conversions, and material circulation processes in the closed ecosystem  and productivity management of a PFAL. Users can also learn efficiently how to skillfully grow plants well with minimum resource consumption and waste generation, and how to use or sell the produce. This characteristic of the PFAL connected with a networked platform is beneficial in promoting a peaceful, inclusive society for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all and building effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels.  4.4.17 Goal 17: strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development Since most aspects of PFAL technology are universal and describable, general information on the PFAL can be shared with people living anywhere in the world using a platform with simultaneous interpretation software via the Internet. The establishment of a global organization for information sharing and capacity building can be expected to strengthen the means for introducing PFALs and to revitalize global as well as local partnerships for sustainable development in society. It has been difficult to spread an agricultural or horticultural technology for open fields and soil cultivation in the greenhouse to various regions with different climate and soils. However, the PFAL can strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development because the PFAL technology is basically universal.   4.5 Learn a simple ecosystem first, then complex ecosystems Compared to the greenhouse, open field, and natural ecosystems, the PFAL is an extremely simple artificial ecosystem. Nevertheless, the PFAL ecosystem is still often too complex to understand in its entirety, especially the rootzone ecosystem where hundreds of environmental and biological variables are interrelated. A PFAL simulator to be developed in the near future will consist of mechanistic models for energy and material balances and photosynthetic plant growth, multiple-variable statistic models for development, morphology and secondary metabolite production of plants, and behavior (or surrogate) and artificial intelligence (AI) models for optimizing plant environments from the viewpoint of costs and benefits of production under given amounts of resources and social demands. Using these models, users can investigate the plant–environment interactions, resource conversion, and circulation processes under controlled environments in the PFAL. The mathematical models used in PFAL management are similar to those used in greenhouse and open field management, although the ranges between upper and lower values of variables are much narrower in the PFAL model than in the greenhouse and the open field models. In addition, certain aspects of the greenhouse and open field models such pesticide application and its effect can be eliminated for simplification of the PFAL model. Thus, the PFAL model is a streamlined educational, self-learning software tool that also introduces beginners to the fundamental principles of greenhouse and open field management, and perhaps even natural ecosystem management (Fig. 4.7 ).   4.6 Conclusion Achieving the SDGs is a challenge for all people living on this planet, especially after the COVID-19, a recent pandemic. Furthermore, there are so many ideas, tools, methods, systems, and collaborative approaches for contributing to the achievement of the SDGs. The PFAL is just one of them. However, PFALs that are properly applied in the various ways discussed in this chapter have enormous potential in contributing to the SDGs. The descriptions in this chapter largely center on the author's limited experience with and theoretical consideration of PFALs constructed in relatively large cities. Therefore, some adjustments would be necessary for the efficient use of PFALs in a rural or a remote area. Achieving the SDGs by 2030 will help us achieve the next mission of establishing technology and innovative ways of thinking to nourish over 9 billion people and enable them to live meaningful lives on this planet in 2050 with minimum consumption of resources and minimum emission of environmental pollutants (Lee, 2019 ). PFAL technology using LEDs emerged around 2000 and is still in its infancy. It is only recently that efforts to apply PFAL technology to achieve the SDGs have started in earnest. Therefore, many promising initiatives to achieve the SDGs through the introduction of PFALs can be expected in the future.   References Chen, 2020 J.
