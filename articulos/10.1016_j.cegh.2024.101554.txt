                  Background
                  Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious public health issue that is linked to social burden and unfavourable health outcomes. With regards to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) targets, this study evaluated the social burden endured by patients and analyzed catastrophic costs, and measured TB incidence and death rates.
               
                  Methods
                  Cross sectional study, with 312 TB patients registered with the National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP) were studied. Social burden, direct and indirect costs, and catastrophic costs were evaluated. TB incidence and death rates are calculated.
               
                  Results
                  The majority of participants (70.8%) were men and married. Patients in substantial numbers reported losing their jobs and having limited access to community events. While divorcees, older age groups, and women were more likely to experience direct catastrophic costs, men and 33–44 years age group were more likely to experience indirect catastrophic costs. The overall catastrophic expenses exceeding 20% of income were observed in male patients, those over 55 years, and patients from nuclear families. The TB incidence rate decreased by 1.8% between 2017 and 2019, with a substantial reduction among males but an alarming increase among females. The death rate experienced a slight rise of 0.27%, with higher rates observed in females compared to males.
               
                  Conclusion
                  Persistent social stigma and the presence of catastrophic costs associated with tuberculosis remain prevalent issues. A multifaceted approach, including enhancing access to healthcare services, implementing awareness campaigns aimed at reducing stigma, expanding TB control and prevention programs is needed. Government interventions aimed at alleviating financial burdens are crucial.

Keywords Social burden  Tuberculosis  Sustainable development goals  Incidence  Fatality    1 Introduction According to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO),1   Tuberculosis (TB) infection has been a leading cause of death worldwide. The highest incidence of TB is found in Africa, followed by the South East Asia Region, accounting for 39% of the global burden of TB in terms of incidence. It is estimated that approximately 3.4 million new cases of TB occur annually, with a majority of them originating from India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Myanmar, and Thailand.2   TB is considered a social disease, with factors such as poor quality of life, inadequate housing, overcrowding, population growth, malnutrition, smoking, alcohol abuse, lack of education, large families, early marriages, and lack of awareness contributing to its occurrence and transmission.2   TB has a significant impact on individuals in the 15–49 years age group, which is the most productive age range. Poverty plays a crucial role in the development and spread of TB, and various studies have shown that the disease has adverse effects on the socioeconomic status of patients.3   Although the global incidence of TB is slowly declining at a rate of 1.6% per year, it is still far from reaching the WHO target of 4–5%.4   The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) include ending the TB epidemic by 2030.5   This goal encompasses three main objectives: reducing catastrophic costs to zero, reducing TB-related deaths by 90% by 2030, and decreasing the incidence of TB by 80% compared to 2015.6   Catastrophic costs are defined as total expenses related to TB management exceeding 20% of the annual pre-TB household income.7   Previous study showed that significant amount of household experiencing catestropic cost due to TB care, particularly patients with. co-infections and hospitalization. around 32.2% of households experienced catastrophic cost due to TB care.8   Evaluating progress toward this goal requires considering both direct and indirect costs, including lost wages and unemployment.9   Monitoring the achievement of these targets is crucial for informing future policy decisions.8   Globally, the incidence of TB is decreasing at a rate of about 2% per year, and between 2015 and 2020, there was an overall reduction of 11%. This progress is slightly over halfway toward the End TB Strategy milestone of a 20% reduction between 2015 and 2020. However, nearly half of TB-affected households worldwide still face costs exceeding 20% of their household income, indicating a failure to achieve the milestone of zero catastrophic costs by 2020.10   India has set an ambitious target of eliminating TB from the country by 2025, five years ahead of the SDG target of 2030.11   Notably, India has reported a significant decrease in TB cases since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic,10   which necessitates an evaluation of the changing trends in incidence, mortality, and catastrophic costs related to TB. The socioeconomic burden of tuberculosis on patients and their households must be studied in order to provide complete patient-friendly TB services and to document the practical benefits of DOTS. The impact of tuberculosis may have long-term consequences that extend beyond the treatment period.12   The present study aims to assess the social burden of TB, evaluate the trends in incidence, fatality, and catastrophic costs among TB patients, and compare them with the targets set by the SDGs. Achieving these targets presents a challenge for high TB burden countries like China and India.  2 Methods 2.1 Study design and setting A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among patients registered under the National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP) in Kancheepuram district, Tamil Nadu, India. The study included patients who were followed up at the time of treatment initiation, end of the intensive phase, and continuation phase.  2.2 Ethical considerations Ethical clearance for the study protocols was obtained from the host institution (1683/IEC/2019). Obtained permission from the Directorate of Medical services (TB) wing RNTCP (Ref: 1.No.1BB/DHSlRNTCP12079, dated: August 10, 2019). Informed consent was obtained from the participants, and they were assured that their data would be kept confidential. The study adhered to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline.  2.3 Estimation of sample size and sampling technique Based on a previous study by Ramya Ananthakrishnan et al.,13   which reported a social burden prevalence of 24.3%, the sample size was calculated as 312 with a relative precision of 20%, using 4PQ/L2 , L = 0.2*24.3 = 4.86. A multistage random sampling method was used to select the study participants. Out of the 13 blocks in Kancheepuram district, 7 blocks were randomly chosen using a lottery method. TB units in each chosen block were included for the study and patient in the selected TB units were enlisted and PPS (Population proportion to size) was done to select the participants.  2.4 Study population The study included all TB patients who registered for treatment under the National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP) in the Kancheepuram district. Study period from December 1, 2019 to June 31, 2020. This included patients with pulmonary and extrapulmonary, both newly diagnosed (Category I) and previously treated (Category II) TB cases.  2.5 Inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria The study included patients aged 18 and above who had registered for NTEP treatment in Kancheepuram district and had been permanent residents for more than a year. Patients who refused to participate and patients diagnosed and died during this period were excluded from study.  2.6 Study tool 2.6.1 Face to face interview was conducted to collect the information from the patients The questionnaire included demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, including age, gender, socio-economic status, occupation, type of house in addition, data were obtained from the patients' TB treatment cards and the TB treatment register. The social burden information contained details about reaction of community people after knowing TB status and faced any adverse reaction like work loss and social stigma, and about freeness to participate in social gatherings, disclosure of TB status to friends and relatives. Direct medical cost including consultations, investigations, drugs, admissions and direct non-medical expenses such as transportation, accommodation, food for patients and attenders and indirect costs such as income loss and productivity or other expenses incurred during the pre and post diagnosis was recorded for patient expenditure details. Catastrophic health costs were defined as TB care costs exceeding 20% of the household's annual income. Information on TB incidence and mortality was obtained from secondary sources, such as registers from TB units.   2.7 Content validity and pretest The questionnaire was reviewed by qualified medical practitioners and pulmonologist to ensure its solidarity with the study objectives and to improve its quality. Feedback from the specialists was incorporated into the questionnaire and pilot study was carried out.  2.8 Data collection procedure Data were collected from seven TB units in Kancheepuram district: Guduvanchery, Kundrathur, Waljabath, Uthiramerur, Thirukalukundram, Madhuradhagam, and Achirapakam. The researcher made three consecutive visits to the patients' houses. In the first visit, the purpose of the study was explained, informed consent was obtained, and assurances of data confidentiality were provided before collecting the data. During the second visit, any additional information or clarification needed was collected. In third visit checked the regularity of medication intake and motivated the patients to adhere to their prescribed treatment.  2.9 Statistical analysis Data were entered into an Excel spread sheet and analyzed using SPSS (IBM) statistical software version 21. Frequency distribution was calculated as percentages, and the total mean (SD) of direct, indirect, and overall costs was determined. Incidence of TB was calculated by number of new cases during a given time period/population at risk during that period*1000 and mortality rates (Number of death from tuberculosis during the year/mid-year population *1000) were also calculated.   3 Results 3.1 Sociodemographic profile The sociodemographic details of the study participants are presented in Table-1  . Out of the 312 patients included in the study, approximately 78.8% were male and 21.2% were female. The average age of the patients was 44.7 years with a standard deviation of 14.1. The majority of the participants were married. Around 28.8% of the patients had no formal education, while 21.5% had completed high school. In terms of occupation, 38.5% were engaged in semi-skilled jobs, and 21.2% were unemployed. The majority of the participants (70.8%) belonged to a nuclear family, followed by 15.7% in joint families and 13.5% in extended families. Regarding socioeconomic status, the largest proportion (36.9%) fell into the middle-class category.  3.2 Social burden Table-1 , displays the responses of the community towards patients' families after knowing about their TB-positive status. Approximately 40.7% of the patients reported being treated the same as before, while 39.7% received sympathy from the community. A smaller percentage of patients experienced adverse reactions from the community. Among the participants, 27.5% reported experiencing job loss due to their TB status. Additionally, 87.5% stated that they did not feel free to participate in community events. The majority of the participants disclosed their positive TB status to their friends and relatives.   3.3 Catastrophic cost Table-2   provides information on the distribution of direct and indirect catastrophic costs among TB patients. It reveals that among females, 31.8% incurred direct catastrophic costs, while individuals over the age of 55 and divorcees both experienced a rate of 34.9%. On the other hand, males had a higher proportion of indirect catastrophic costs at 93.1%, and those aged 33–44 years had the highest rate of 96.2%. When considering the overall catastrophic expenses (i.e., both direct and indirect costs) exceeding 20% of their income, male patients had the highest percentage at 96.3% compared to female patients at 86.4%. Patients over the age of 55 had a rate of 91.9%, while patients from nuclear families had a percentage of 95.9%. Among marital status categories, married patients accounted for 94.1% of overall catastrophic costs, and divorced patients reported 100%. Table-3   shows, among 312 patients those who have sought pre diagnosis treatment care (including both private and public facilities), total expenditure was ₹16318 (4510, 38574) which is seems to be higher than for those who have taken treatment care post diagnosis ₹15992 (4264, 32829).  3.4 Incidence and death rate In Table-4  , it is indicated that the total tuberculosis incidence between 2017 and 2019 decreased by 1.8%. Specifically, the overall TB incidence among the male population decreased by 39%, indicating a significant reduction. On the other hand, the total TB incidence among females showed an increase of 28% over the same period, signifying a concerning upward trend. Table-4  provides information on the death rate due to TB. In 2017, the death rate was 3.49%, which increased slightly to 3.76% in 2019. Among the deaths, females had a higher death rate of 5.54% compared to males, who had a death rate of 3.56%. It is noteworthy that the overall increase in the death rate was minimal, with only a 0.27% rise observed from 2017 to 2019 in our study.   4 Discussion Our study findings have revealed that a significant proportion of TB patients experience social burden. Most family members and community members treated them as they did before even after knowing their health condition. Approximately 40% of patients treated sympathetically, regardless of their social status. These findings are consistent with a study conducted by Kamble et al.14   among TB patients attending DOTS centers in Delhi. Work loss, and avoidance from community members were more prevalent, approximately 7% of TB patients in our study did not disclose their disease status to any of their family member till their treatment course completion which aligns with the findings of studies by Thakur et al.15   and PH Mason et al.16  . These studies highlighted the persistence of social stigma, such as reluctance to disclose a family member's TB infection to others. While this proportion is relatively low, it can still be significant in a country like India where over two million people are newly diagnosed with TB each year. Hatred and stigma were found to be higher in rural areas than urban areas these findings are similar to the study by Pai Met. al.11   The results of the current study were compared against the tuberculosis (TB) targets achieved in selected TB units, as well as the TB targets outlined by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030. These SDG targets include achieving 0% catastrophic cost, an 80% reduction in incidence, and a 90% reduction in the death rate associated with TB. The analysis revealed that reaching these set goals would require a considerable amount of time, indicating a significant gap between the current status and the desired targets. Male patients, especially those with nuclear families and above the age of 55, experienced higher catastrophic costs compared to female patients. The cost incurred post diagnosis may due to expenditure for guardians, transportation and job loss. These findings are consistent with studies by Muniyandi et al.16  , 17   Prasanna et al.,8   Stracker,18   and Yang et al.19  (8). Globally, it is estimated that TB patients and their households may face catastrophic costs ranging from 27% to 71%, reflecting the economic burden and barriers to accessing proper care for themselves. These costs can impede diagnostic procedures and treatment adherence, leading to poor health outcomes and financial distress. The study observed a 1.8% reduction in TB incidence from 2017 to 2019, with a slight increase of 0.27% in the death rate. The incidence of TB increased among males compared to females, while mortality appeared slightly higher in females. These findings are similar to a previous study by Deepak Dhamnetiya et al.20   which revealed that incidence and mortality was higher among males than females. Another study by Varshney K21   also reported there was an increase in TB cases across India since start of covid 19. According to our findings there was a decline trend in the incidence rate this difference is due to their assessment after the start of covid 19. A study by Srinath Sathyanarayana et al.22   showed a 4% reduction in the death rate in India in 2018. While the annual number of TB deaths is decreasing globally, it is not declining rapidly enough to reach the first milestone of the End TB Strategy, which aimed for a 35% reduction between 2015 and 2020. Our findings showed meager increase in the TB death rate which does not affect the decreasing trend but need there is need to track the death rate further. The cumulative reduction between 2015 and 2019 was only 14%, less than halfway towards the milestone.6    5 Limitations One limitation of the current study is its limited generalizability, as it was conducted in a specific district or region. Another potential limitation is the reliance on self-reported data, which introduces the possibility of recall bias. Under reporting and over reporting of expenditure are common recall bias to reduce this proper verification of hospital bills, travel tickets laboratory bills etc was done. Participants' ability to accurately remember and report social burden, community reactions, and disclosure of their disease status could be compromised. Additionally, social desirability bias may have influenced participants to provide socially desirable responses, potentially leading to an underreporting of negative experiences. Finally, the study's restricted time frame may limit the ability to capture long-term trends and changes in TB incidence, mortality, and social factors.  6 Recommendation The implementation of comprehensive control and prevention measures for TB is crucial in increasing awareness about tuberculosis and alleviating the social burden associated with the disease. Workplace policies should be established to address job loss issues faced by TB-positive individuals. Multidisciplinary team including Physicians, psychiatrists, counsellors, dieticians and peripheral health workers play a vital role in raising awareness and providing counselling to patients and their families, motivating patients for follow-up visit, emphasizing the utilization of government schemes to mitigate the economic burden. The government can further support TB patients by providing subsidized food rations and daily necessities, extending the benefits of the Mid-day meal program to improve patients' nutrition, and offering ticket-free travel on buses and trains for those seeking treatment. To reduce catastrophic cost, government can provide incentives to TB affected families. Efforts should be made to reduce the stigma surrounding TB through community awareness campaigns, including the use of social media platforms. Additionally, creating a seamless connection between public and private healthcare services is essential for effective management of TB patients. Therefore, additional financial protection through insurance schemes or other cost-cutting initiatives and socioeconomic support during the treatment period should be incorporated into the End TB approach.  7 Conclusion In conclusion, tuberculosis (TB) continues to pose a significant burden on individuals, families, and communities worldwide. The findings underscore the importance of reinforcing control and prevention measures to reduce the impact of TB on society. Government interventions, such as subsidized food provisions, improved access to transportation for treatment, and the integration of public and private healthcare services, can help alleviate the economic burden on TB patients. By adopting a comprehensive approach that addresses social, economic, and healthcare factors, we can work towards reducing the incidence, mortality, and social burden of TB, ultimately achieving the global targets outlined in the End TB Strategy and the Sustainable Development Goals.
