                  Background
                  Global sustainability is an enmeshed system of complex socioeconomic, climatological, and ecological interactions. The numerous objectives of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement have various levels of interdependence, making it difficult to ascertain the influence of changes to particular indicators across the whole system. In this analysis, we aimed to detect and rank the complex interlinkages between objectives of sustainability agendas.
               
                  Methods
                  We developed a method to find interlinkages among the 17 SDGs and climate change, including non-linear and non-monotonic dependences. We used time series of indicators defined by the World Bank, consisting of 400 indicators that measure progress towards the 17 SDGs and an 18th variable (annual average temperatures), representing progress in the response to the climate crisis, from 2000 to 2019. This method detects significant dependencies among the time evolution of the objectives by using partial distance correlations, a non-linear measure of conditional dependence that also discounts spurious correlations originating from lurking variables. We then used a network representation to identify the most important objectives (using network centrality) and to obtain nexuses of objectives (defined as highly interconnected clusters in the network).
               
                  Findings
                  Using temporal data from 181 countries spanning 20 years, we analysed dependencies among SDGs and climate for 35 country groupings based on region, development, and income level. The observed significant interlinkages, central objectives, and nexuses identified varied greatly across country groupings; however, SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals) and climate change ranked as highly important across many country groupings. Temperature rise was strongly linked to urbanisation, air pollution, and slum expansion (SDG 11), especially in country groupings likely to be worst affected by climate breakdown, such as Africa. In several country groupings composed of developing nations, we observed a consistent nexus of strongly interconnected objectives formed by SDG 1 (poverty reduction), SDG 4 (education), and SDG 8 (economic growth), sometimes incorporating SDG 5 (gender equality), and SDG 16 (peace and justice).
               
                  Interpretation
                  The differences across groupings emphasise the need to define goals in accordance with local circumstances and priorities. Our analysis highlights global partnerships (SDG 17) as a pivot in global sustainability efforts, which have been strongly linked to economic growth (SDG 8). However, if economic growth and trade expansion were repositioned as a means instead of an end goal of development, our analysis showed that education (SDG 4) and poverty reduction (SDG 1) become more central, thus suggesting that these could be prioritised in global partnerships. Urban livelihoods (SDG 11) were also flagged as important to avoid replicating unsustainable patterns of the past.

This is an Open Access article under the CC BY 4.0 license Primary Research  Articles    Figure 1 Example of a non-linear relationship between two indicators from the World Bank21   dataset for countries in Latin America and the Caribbean Represented is one of the indicators of SDG 4—children out of school (percentage of primary school age)—and one of the indicators of SDG 17—GDP per capita, purchasing power parity (constant 2011 international $). Each point corresponds to the latest available measurement of the two indicators for a country in this grouping. The dependence between the indicators is captured more accurately through a non-linear, non-monotonic relationship rather than a linear one, as shown by a high, significant distance correlation versus a weak, non-significant linear (Pearson) correlation. The non-linearity and lack of monotonicity is reflected in a synergistic relationship up to about 20 000–25 000 international $ of GDP that turns detrimental with higher values of GDP (for Panama, Puerto Rico, and The Bahamas). GDP=gross domestic product. SDG=Sustainable Development Goal.    Figure 2 The network of SDGs and climate change (A) and normalised eigenvector centralities (B) for the country grouping Emerging Markets The grouping Emerging Markets includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa plus the Next 11 countries. (A) The nodes correspond to the 17 SDGs and annual temperatures and the weighted edges capture the minimum partial distance correlations; the p values of the corresponding conditional independence tests are visualised as different line styles.

The numerous objectives of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement have various levels of interdependence, making it difficult to ascertain the influence of changes to particular indicators across the whole system. In this analysis, we aimed to detect and rank the complex interlinkages between objectives of sustainability agendas.  Methods We developed a method to find interlinkages among the 17 SDGs and climate change, including non-linear and non-monotonic dependences. We used time series of indicators defined by the World Bank, consisting of 400 indicators that measure progress towards the 17 SDGs and an 18th variable (annual average temperatures), representing progress in the response to the climate crisis, from 2000 to 2019. This method detects significant dependencies among the time evolution of the objectives by using partial distance correlations, a non-linear measure of conditional dependence that also discounts spurious correlations originating from lurking variables. We then used a network representation to identify the most important objectives (using network centrality) and to obtain nexuses of objectives (defined as highly interconnected clusters in the network).  Findings Using temporal data from 181 countries spanning 20 years, we analysed dependencies among SDGs and climate for 35 country groupings based on region, development, and income level. The observed significant interlinkages, central objectives, and nexuses identified varied greatly across country groupings; however, SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals) and climate change ranked as highly important across many country groupings. Temperature rise was strongly linked to urbanisation, air pollution, and slum expansion (SDG 11), especially in country groupings likely to be worst affected by climate breakdown, such as Africa. In several country groupings composed of developing nations, we observed a consistent nexus of strongly interconnected objectives formed by SDG 1 (poverty reduction), SDG 4 (education), and SDG 8 (economic growth), sometimes incorporating SDG 5 (gender equality), and SDG 16 (peace and justice).  Interpretation The differences across groupings emphasise the need to define goals in accordance with local circumstances and priorities. Our analysis highlights global partnerships (SDG 17) as a pivot in global sustainability efforts, which have been strongly linked to economic growth (SDG 8). However, if economic growth and trade expansion were repositioned as a means instead of an end goal of development, our analysis showed that education (SDG 4) and poverty reduction (SDG 1) become more central, thus suggesting that these could be prioritised in global partnerships. Urban livelihoods (SDG 11) were also flagged as important to avoid replicating unsustainable patterns of the past.

Introduction The current architecture of global sustainability is framed by two UN landmark agendas: the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. While both agendas follow principles of equity and sustainable development, the Paris Agreement primarily focuses on strengthening the global response to the climate crisis. The purpose of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is to promote prosperity and social justice by tackling inequality issues around poverty, hunger, and gender, but it also includes environmental objectives, such as fostering biodiversity and increasing resilience to a changing climate. Indeed, the objectives of both agendas, embodied in the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the goal of keeping global warming below 1·5°C, are inextricably linked.1,2   To date, interlinkages between these objectives have commonly been categorised as either counteracting (trade-offs) or reinforcing (synergies),3–9   as determined through quantitative studies using linear2,3,10,11   or rank-based correlations,4,5,8,12   or regression-based techniques.6,13   However, such a categorisation can be restrictive and misleading because it corresponds, in essence, to characterising the system of SDGs and climate change as an ensemble of linearly or monotonically related variables (we interchangeably use the terms variable, objective, and node to refer to the 17 SDGs plus climate change).6,10   This simplification overlooks the known complexities of interconnected socioeconomic, climatological, and ecological systems, characterised by non-linear, non-monotonic relationships. In reality, the relationship between any two given objectives might be both counteracting and reinforcing, depending on the values of the variables, as exemplified in figure 1  . If policies are implemented ignoring the complex nature of such interlinkages, they might end up being counterproductive for the achievement of the two sustainability agendas in some countries or classes of society. Research in context  Evidence before this study  We searched Google Scholar for related publications with the search terms “SDGs”, “SDG interlinkages”, “SDG interactions”, “SDG dependencies”, and “SDG relationships” from Jan 10, 2021, to Feb 5, 2022. No language restrictions were applied. We found that interlinkages among the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have been studied, both qualitatively and quantitatively, yet these studies have rarely taken climate change into account. Qualitative work has often focused on dependencies between a specific sustainability-related objective and other SDGs in particular contexts. Quantitative methods analysing the system from a more holistic perspective have been predominantly based on linear (Pearson correlation) or rank-based dependences (Spearman correlation), assuming stationarity of variables, and have calculated relationships between any two SDGs without considering the (confounding) effect of the remaining SDGs on the considered pair, which can cause spurious associations. The correlation coefficients thus obtained have then been used to classify relationships as synergies (positive coefficient) or trade-offs (negative coefficient). Taking correlation coefficients as edge weights for networks comprising the 17 SDGs, graph-level and node-level metrics (eg, degree or eigenvector centrality) have sometimes been computed. Recent work has explored the contextual nature of the interlinkages by disaggregating countries into income levels or regions and defining pairwise relationships for country groupings separately. Added value of this study  This work develops a methodological framework for how complex interconnected systems could be deciphered in various regional, geopolitical, and economic contexts, and addresses three limitations of existing research. Firstly, motivated by the integrative nature of policy design for climate, development, and sustainability, we viewed the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement as one interrelated system of 18 temporal variables corresponding to the 17 SDGs plus annual mean temperatures, which we used as the sole indicator for climate change because other climate change indicators are correlated with, or caused by, rising temperatures. Secondly, we allowed for non-linear, non-monotonic relationships between the 18 variables through a non-parametric measure of dependence, the distance correlation, which was also tested for significance. Thirdly, we conditioned pairwise relationships on any possible subset of the remaining variables to control for shared influences, and thus quantify direct dependencies between pairs of variables. For several country groupings, we represented the obtained dependencies among the 18 interrelated objectives as a network, which was analysed to compute the centrality (ie, the relative importance) of each objective and to which we applied community detection to find nexuses (ie, groups of strongly interconnected variables). Implications of all the available evidence  Our analysis revealed geographical, political, and economic differences in the interlinkages among SDGs and climate change. These findings support the stance that a thorough understanding of local realities and contexts are central to sustainability-related issues and could be particularly challenging for developing countries if evidence-based conclusions created by and for the Global North are suggested or imposed as obvious solutions to the Global South. For instance, we showed that foreign investment, an indicator of SDG 17, is strongly connected to economic growth (SDG 8) in many groupings that include developing countries, but this foreign investment could be alternatively focused on objectives such as poverty reduction or improved health, which are more central than economic growth, and thus more closely linked to wide effects in the whole system.      In our analysis, we explicitly account for the possibility of non-linear, non-monotonic interactions between objectives by calculating the distance correlation, a measure that can detect any form of non-linear relationships.14   Furthermore, our method controls for observed confounders, or lurking variables, to avoid spurious associations.15,16   By finding the minimum partial distance correlation over all possible conditioning subsets of other variables, we measured the direct strength of the relationship between any two objectives, discounting the influence of other variables.17   To illustrate this issue, consider an example from Nerini and colleagues,18   who analysed links between SDG 7 and other SDGs on a global level and found strong relationships between SDG 7 and both SDGs 8 and 17. Our results concurred with the strong connection between SDG 7 and 17, but we found a very weak direct link between SDG 7 and 8. Examining the conditioning set of the link between SDG 7 and 8, we saw that SDG 17 is a confounder that induced the spuriously strong dependence observed in Nerini and colleagues,18   whereas it was discounted in our analysis. To the best of our knowledge, the issues of confounders and detection of significant arbitrary non-linear relationships between non-stationary variables have not been tackled in relation to SDG interlinkages to date.5,6,8,19,20   Here, we aimed to apply our approach to detect and rank the complex interlinkages between objectives of sustainability agendas. We used time series of indicators defined by the World Bank21   to track progress towards the 17 SDGs, and an 18th variable (annual average temperatures) to measure progress towards the Paris Agreement. This choice was motivated by the fact that SDG 13, which is dedicated to climate action, focuses on adapting to rather than mitigating the concurrent climate breakdown. After calculating the significant interlinkages, we integrated and visualised the collective information through a network representation, where each variable is represented by a node with edges weighted by the minimum partial distance correlation. To capture the differences in interlinkages across the world, separate networks were computed for various regional, geopolitical, and economic country groupings. These networks not only visually summarise our findings but allow further analyses; specifically, we investigate which of the SDGs are most central for different country groupings, to obtain clusters of SDGs with strong interdependencies to each other, which we denote as nexuses.  Methods Data sources Time series measuring progress on the SDGs are available from multiple sources. Our dataset was taken from the World Bank21   and consists of 400 indicators measuring progress of the 17 SDGs from 2000 to 2019. We chose the World Bank dataset because its indicators focus on outcomes and impacts, rather than on recording inputs and procedures as those in the UN22   dataset. We refrained from using the SDG Index and Dashboard23   data due to its reduced number of indicators (85). For annual country-level average temperatures, we used data from the Climatic Research Unit.24   Because the World Bank dataset for SDG 13 only had measurements for one year at the time of this analysis, we used instead indicators 13.1.1 and 13.1.3 of the UN22   dataset for country-level time series of SDG 13, as was also done in the study by Lusseau and Mancini.6   We removed from SDG 17 the redundant indicator “net official development assistance received (current US$)”, since it already appears in SDG 10. Therefore, our dataset consisted of 400 indicators measured from 2000 to 2019 in 181 countries. Each indicator is associated with one of the 18 objectives (17 SDGs plus climate change). To impute missing values, we used the weighted average of countries with available measurements, with weights inversely proportional to the Euclidean distance between indicators (additional details in the appendix, pp 1–2 ). For our contextual analysis of results, countries were grouped regionally, geopolitically, and economically, resulting in a total of 35 different groupings (appendix pp 50–51 ).  Notation For a given grouping of n  countries, we considered the countries as independent samples of the grouping, hence the sample size of a grouping equals n . Let X  represent one of our 18 variables (SDGs and climate change). Each variable X  has an associated set of indicators I X , and each indicator i ΣI X  has T (X,i)  observations over time (some possibly imputed). The variable X  is constructed by appending  all its indicators into a vector of dimensionality
						d x  = ∑ i = 1  l x   T X , i         In our case, T (X,i) =20 for all indicators, and thus d X =20| I X |, where |I X | is the number of indicators for variable X . Next, we introduced the method to compute non-linear dependencies between any two such variables X  and Y , discounting the influence of the remaining 16 variables.  Distance correlation The distance covariance14,25   between X  ∈ R dX  and Y  ∈ R dY , denoted by V2 (X,Y) , is a measure of dependence between X  and Y  with the following important properties: V2 (X,Y) ≥0, with equality if and only if X  and Y  are independent, meaning that it is a non-parametric measure that—unlike Pearson or Spearman correlation—is able to pick up non-monotonic dependencies (figure 1 ); V2 (X,Y) =V2 (Y,X) , meaning that it is symmetric; and V2 (X,Y)  is well defined for d X  ≠ d Y . This last property makes it particularly well suited for our setting since, due to the different numbers of indicators per SDG, dimensionality varies considerably between variables. The distance correlation14  R2 (X,Y)  is the normalised version of the distance covariance and its properties include the following: (i) 0≤R2 (X,Y) ≤1, meaning that it is a normalised quantity; and R2 (X,Y) =1 if and only if X  and Y  are linearly dependent. V2 (X,Y)  and R2 (X,Y)  are defined in terms of the underlying joint distribution of (X,Y) , denoted as P (X,Y) , which is usually unknown (appendix pp 2–3 ), hence they have to be estimated from data.  Unbiased estimator of the distance covariance Suppose that we have access to a sample of pairs of the joint distribution: (x 1 , y 1 ),...,(x n , y n )~P (X,Y) . We start by computing the pairwise Euclidean distances between samples
						(1) a i j   = ‖ x i  - x j   ‖  , b i j   = ‖ γ i  - γ j   ‖  ∀ i , j = 1 , … , n .      Next, we define the distance matrices A =(A ij )n i,j=1  and B =(B ij )n i,j=1  as
						(2) A i j   = a i j   - 1 n - 2   ∑ l = 1  n  a i l    - 1 n - 2   ∑ k = 1  n  a k j    + 1 ( n - 1  )  ( n - 2  )    ∑ k , l = 1 n    a k l         For i  ≠ j  and 0 otherwise, and similarly for B i,j . An unbiased estimator of the sample distance covariance V 2 n  
                        (X,Y)  is given by the inner product:14  (3) V n 2  ( X , Y  )  : = 〈 A , B  〉  = 1 n ( n - 3  )    ∑ i , j = 1  n  A i , j   B i , j        which converges to the population distance covariance V2 (X,Y)  as n →∞ almost surely.  Partial distance correlation Given two variables X  and Y , another variable (or a set of other variables) is a confounder if it (causally) influences both X  and Y . This might induce statistical association between X  and Y  even if neither of them directly influences the other. Hence, pairwise dependence between X  and Y  might occur due to influences of the remaining 16 nodes. To establish the direct strength of dependence between any pair of nodes (X ,Y ), we factored out shared effects from other nodes by conditioning on any subset of the remaining nodes: Z  ⊆ \ V  {X ,Y }, where V  is the set of 18 nodes. The pairwise distances c ij :=||z i– z j || are constructed from the vector of variables over the subset Z , and the elements of the distance matrix C ij  for Z  are computed analogously to equation 1 and equation 2. For any number n ≥4 of samples {(x i ,y i ,z i )}n i=1  from (X ,Y ,Z ), let A (x ), B (y ) and C (z ) be the distance matrices computed using the samples x =(x 1 ,...,x n ), y =(y 1 ,...,y n ), and z =(z 1 ,...,z n ), respectively. The projection P z (x ) of A (x ) onto C (z ) and the complementary orthogonal projection P z⊥  (x ) are defined by
						(4) P Z  ( x )  : = 〈 A ( x )  , C ( z )   〉   〈 C ( z )  , C ( z )   〉    C ( z )  , P z ⊥   ( x )  : = A ( x )  - P Z  ( x )      and similarly for the projection P z (y ) and orthogonal projection P z⊥  (y ) of B (y)  onto C (z) . The sample partial distance correlation R* n  (X ,Y  | Z ) is then defined as the normalised dot product of the orthogonal projections:15  (5) P n *  ( X , Y | Z  )  : = P Z  ( x )  ċ P Z  ( γ )   | P Z ⊥   ( x )   |  | P Z ⊥   ( γ )   |    ,     where we use the definition of the inner product in equation 3. The partial distance correlation establishes the strength of the dependence between X  and Y  that cannot be explained by Z . Finally, as a measure of the direct dependence between X  and Y , we took the minimal partial distance correlation over all possible subsets:
						(6) R n *  ( X , Y  )  = min  Z ⊆ V \ { X , Y  }    R n *  ( X , Y | Z  )  ,     which reflects the strength of the dependence between X  and Y  that cannot be explained by the subset Z  that most influences both X  and Y . In our case, we had 153 unique pairs of the 18 variables (SDGs and climate change). For each variable pair, we computed the partial distance correlation (equation 6) by minimising over the 65 535 conditional sets Z  formed by the remaining 16 variables. This process was repeated for each of the 35 country groupings to obtain a contextualised description of the dependencies among SDGs and climate change.  Statistical testing: significant partial distance correlations To establish the significance of the minimal partial distance correlations (equation 6), we tested against the null hypothesis of X  being independent of Y  given Z . To achieve this, we did a permutation test where we produced 10 000 random reorderings of the samples x  while the samples y  and z  were unchanged.15   We rejected the null hypothesis if the corresponding p value was lower than or equal to a predetermined significance level of α {0·01,0·05,0·1}. When the minimal partial distance correlation between X  and Y  is found to be significant for a given level of α, we say there is an interlinkage between the two variables.  Network analysis For any given grouping of countries, the procedure described produced a set of significant interlinkages among the 18 variables, with strengths given by equation 6. To further analyse the intermeshed dependencies, we used a network representation, where the variables are nodes and the significant minimal partial distance correlations (equation 6) constitute weighted edges. Having thus constructed an undirected, weighted network for every country grouping, we did two further analyses. Firstly, we quantified the relative importance of each of the 18 nodes (variables) using eigenvector centrality, a network-theoretic measure that gives high ranks to nodes that have strong relationships to other highly ranked nodes. Secondly, we applied community detection by modularity maximisation to group nodes into nexuses, meaning clusters of variables with strong interdependencies. Both methods are described in detail in the appendix (pp 5–6) .  Role of the funding source The funders of the study had no role in data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the manuscript.   Results We analysed 35 groupings of countries reflecting various geographical and socioeconomic factors. An example of our results is presented in figure 2  , illustrating the network of 18 variables and the eigenvector centralities for one country grouping (Emerging Markets; appendix p 51 ). Overall, we found vastly different networks and eigenvector centralities across country groupings. This differing picture across the contextualised networks supports the call to view the system of interrelated SDGs and climate change through jurisdictional and political lenses.26   The analysis of all groupings is presented in full in the appendix (pp 8–40) , with all significant interlinkages, networks of objectives, eigenvector centralities, and nexuses described. Here, we highlight a few key findings. We calculated the three most central variables along with their eigenvector centrality for each of the 35 groupings (listed in the table  ). We found that SDG 17, dedicated to enhancing national and international partnerships in the public and private sectors, was among the top three most central variables for 20 (57%) of 35 groupings (table ). The annual average temperature (climate change variable) appeared central in country groupings that are likely to be among the worst affected by, and least responsible for, climate change (eg, Africa, Caribbean, Central America, Southern Asia, and Western Asia).27   In most country groupings, efforts encompassing climate adaptation, as measured by the indicators of SDG 13, have not been as central as annual average temperatures, our indicator for climate mitigation. We also found that economic growth (SDG 8) was relatively less important in most groupings than other variables, especially in groupings of advanced economies (eg, High Income and Global North groupings), although it is highly central in other groupings, such as the Global South and, particularly, the Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States. Other variables frequently found among the three most important ones were SDG 11, whose indicators track air pollution and urban population (eg, Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeastern Asia, and Northern Europe groupings); SDG 4 on education (eg, Global South grouping); and SDG 1, considering monetary and multidimensional poverty and the coverage of social protection schemes (eg, Americas and Oceania groupings). However, if SDG 8 was not intertwined with SDG 17 (we deleted the edge between SDG 17 and SDG 8 in our network and recomputed the centralities), SDG 8 became less central than SDG 4, SDG 1, SDG 3, SDG 7, SDG 11, and SDG 16 in the Global South grouping. We compared the strength of the interlinkages and the centralities of the objectives between the Global South and Global North groupings (summarised in figure 3  ). We found that SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals) was involved in four of the five strongest interlinkages in the Global North grouping, which resulted in SDG 17 being the most important SDG by a considerable margin in that grouping. By contrast, SDG 17 only appeared twice in the five strongest pairs in the Global South grouping, as often as SDG 4 (education), which shared the highest importance in this grouping. The high centrality of the pair SDG 17 and SDG 8 (economic growth) was the only common denominator observed between the Global South and Global North groupings. The largest discrepancy in the strength of the interlinkages between these two country groupings appeared for the SDG pairs 5–8, 9–17, and 2–7, and the largest discrepancy in the centralities of the objectives was observed in the importance of SDG 4 (quality education) and SDG 16 (peace, justice, and strong institutions), which were more central in the Global South grouping, and SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), which was more central in the Global North grouping. The nexuses of objectives found across the different country groupings were also diverse. One nexus that was found across many groupings, especially those including developing countries, combined poverty reduction (SDG 1), education (SDG 4), and economic growth (SDG 8). In the Sub-Saharan Africa grouping, for instance, this nexus also included SDG 16 and SDG 5. In the Sub-Saharan Africa grouping, we also observed a nexus including urbanisation (SDG 11), clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), health (SDG 3), and inequality (SDG 10), as is typical for groupings that include low-income nations. Two other repeatedly observed nexuses were one including SDG 7 and SDG 9, which sometimes included mean annual temperatures, with SDG 10 or SDG 12 (eg, in Latin America and the Caribbean); and another including health (SDG 3) and clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), for example, in the Europe grouping.  Discussion Although the interdependencies between some of the SDGs and climate change are known,28,29   a systematic assessment has so far only been pursued qualitatively on a global level1   and quantitatively in a scenario modelling framework.30   Our quantitative study goes beyond global interlinkages and systematically analysed 35 country groupings, considering non-linear and non-monotonic relationships and removing spurious dependencies originating from confounding variables without relying on assumed interdependencies, as scenario modelling frameworks usually do. Additionally, we used our network analyses to rank variables according to their relative importance and to group them into nexuses. Our results show stark differences across country groupings, some of which have been found in related studies.4,6,19   These differences call for contextualised policy prioritisation and resource allocation, motivating the inclusion of a diverse group of stakeholders with deep local expertise in decision-making processes. For issues related to climate breakdown, the benefits of including local knowledge have been clearly communicated,31,32   but such involvement should be expanded to the larger set of societal, environmental, and economic objectives for an effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement. The central role of SDG 17, which advocates for the enhancement of multilateral collaborations, and its strong link to SDG 8 (economic growth) have been missing in related work,6,33   but they often appear in our analysis, such as in the Global South and Global North groupings (figure 3 ). Given the fact that the indicators of SDG 17 include foreign private investment, the strong association between SDG 17 and SDG 8 in the Global South grouping might originate from the pursuit of economic growth, arguably facilitated by the appetite for high returns on investment of financial organisations and their associates in advanced economies.34   These findings suggest that the aim of international partnerships to deliver on poverty reduction, public health, access to (renewable) electricity, and peace and strong jurisdictions, could be strengthened by shifting the purpose of global partnerships (SDG 17) away from the primary pursuit of economic growth. Despite being widely accepted as the panacea to humanitarian crises in the current capitalocene, overly focusing on economic growth has been devastating for many livelihoods and natural habitats.35   For the Global South grouping, our analyses of centrality and nexuses show the need to strengthen the links between SDG 17 and variables such as education (SDG 4),36   which are more central regarding multiple objectives across sustainability-related issues. Urbanisation at speed in developing countries helps to explain why SDG 11 was central across multiple Global South groupings, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Southeastern Asia. Here, urban planning should consider the implications on poverty reduction (SDG 1), international partnerships (SDG 17), and peace and justice systems (SDG 16), besides their global environmental impact (through temperature rises), as already outlined by Haughton.37   There are several methodological limitations to our analysis that are worth stating. Our time series have measurements at most over the past 20 years. This range is enough to discover many interlinkages, but some could be missed—most likely for the environmental objectives of SDG 14 and SDG 15. Related research suggests dependencies of these objectives to health and wellbeing (SDG 3),38   food (SDG 2) and water security (SDG 6), disaster risk reduction (SDG 13), and obviously climate change.11   Additionally, it is important to state that, with a view towards informing policy decisions, our measures detected correlations but did not derive cause-effect relationships. Although Granger-causality methods,39   which assume linearity and stationarity, have been proposed, it is important to develop causal analysis for non-linear and non-stationary datasets, such as those relevant in this study. This is an open area for future research. An overall conclusion of our work is that the traditional viewpoint that classifies interlinkages as positive (synergies) or negative (trade-offs), through Pearson2,3,10,40   and Spearman4,5,8,12   correlations, is limiting and restrictive, missing many important non-linear relationships. This, in turn, risks curtailing policy makers and overall progress towards human development and planetary health. Our measure of dependence, the partial distance correlation, enabled us to unveil relationships of any non-linear and non-monotonic form, thus capturing the complex interplays characteristic of socioeconomic, climatological, and ecological systems. Our systematic elimination of confounder effects and the assessment of significance adds further reliability to the analyses. Indeed, comparing our results to those obtained by Warchold and colleagues4   using Spearman correlations together with the maximal information criterion on the UN dataset,22   we found strong dependencies for many pairs of variables (eg, SDGs 7–9, SDGs 7–17, and SDGs 8–17 for all countries) that were labelled as not classified under their analysis due to non-monotonic relationships. Similarly, Swain and Ranganathan3   used Pearson correlations without significance tests: they reported interlinkages that we did not find (eg, SDGs 2–3, SDGs 8–9, SDGs 2–7, and SDGs 2–15 in sub-Saharan Africa) due to our elimination of confounder effects, and they missed connections that could only be discovered by our non-linear and non-monotonic dependence measure (eg, SDGs 1–8 and SDGs 8–17 in Sub-Saharan Africa). With such additional knowledge, policy makers can consider potential tipping points that might flip a synergistic relationship to a detrimental one (figure 1 ). Through this more accurate understanding of the interlinkages at play, we hope that data-based policy making can evaluate the complex interconnected influences of the different factors to progress current and future climate, development, and sustainability agendas.
