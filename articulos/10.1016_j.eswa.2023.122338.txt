                  In European countries the measurement of the efficiency of Research, Development and Innovation (R&D&I) is a problematic issue for politicians and the general population. For this reason, the United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) signed by UN Member States in 2015 includes SDG 9 for Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure. The objective of this study is to assess whether European countries efficiently manage their R&D&I resources. To meet this objective, the output-oriented Dynamic DEA with Network structure based on SBM framework (DNSBM) is used under constant returns in order to first, verify how European countries are positioned in their contribution to realizing SDG 9, considering the dynamic relationships between the resources allocated to R&D&I and their results; and, second, define the long-term relationships between them by applying the Cumulative Divisional Malmquist Index (CDMI) model. This work contributes to the advancement of the research via: (1) development of a framework for the analysis of R&D&I efficiency based on a dynamic network optimization model, where the analyzed periods present interdependence based on the relationships between the inputs and outputs of the R&D&I of SDG 9 and (2) development of a new conceptual model to measure efficiency in the management of R&D&I in a sample of European countries.

In European countries the measurement of the efficiency of Research, Development and Innovation (R&D&I) is a problematic issue for politicians and the general population. For this reason, the United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) signed by UN Member States in 2015 includes SDG 9 for Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure. The objective of this study is to assess whether European countries efficiently manage their R&D&I resources. To meet this objective, the output-oriented Dynamic DEA with Network structure based on SBM framework (DNSBM) is used under constant returns in order to first, verify how European countries are positioned in their contribution to realizing SDG 9, considering the dynamic relationships between the resources allocated to R&D&I and their results; and, second, define the long-term relationships between them by applying the Cumulative Divisional Malmquist Index (CDMI) model. This work contributes to the advancement of the research via: (1) development of a framework for the analysis of R&D&I efficiency based on a dynamic network optimization model, where the analyzed periods present interdependence based on the relationships between the inputs and outputs of the R&D&I of SDG 9 and (2) development of a new conceptual model to measure efficiency in the management of R&D&I in a sample of European countries.

The investments made in R&D by the countries of the European Union (EU), and the results obtained, have been of particular importance in recent years (Kacprzyk and Świeczewska, 2019; Karadayi and Ekinci, 2019; Paramati et al., 2021 ). In addition, Mergoni and De Witte (2021)  affirm that competitiveness and the development of innovation are relevant concepts in public investment, one of the main sustainable development objectives of the EU. Mahroum and Al-Saleh (2013)  affirm that the efficiency of R&D&I is mainly focused on the cross-sectional static efficiency in a specified period. However, the evaluation of the general efficiency of national investment in R&D&I should be carried out in several long-term periods to determine the performance of governments in the allocation of resources, and in the management of R&D activities, thus establishing the temporal and spatial dimensions within the economy as a whole. These need to quantify efficiency from a dynamic perspective, explained in the Theory of Dynamic Efficiency (Kirzner, 1997, 1998 ) which considers dynamic efficiency as the capacity of an economic system to promote creativity, innovation, and business coordination (North, 1990; Moreno-Casas and Bagus, 2022; Fils et al., 2023 ). Nevertheless, there is still a significant research gap in the body of literature on how to measure the dynamic efficiency of R&D&I, and on the relationships between the resources used and the results obtained (Chen and Guan, 2012; Mahroum and Al-Saleh, 2013; Gong et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2018; Xiao et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022 ), in line with UN SDG 9. Specifically, one of the issues that requires more research is related to the interdependence of national R&D&I activities since, to date, studies consider it independently between different periods (Chen and Guan, 2012; Guan and Chen, 2012; Carayannis et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2020 ). This leads us to affirm that the R&D&I of one period is not independent of the next period, in practice. Further, there are relationships between investments and their results that normally make innovation systems advance or regress in achieving their objectives. In this context, the first objective of this work consists of developing a framework for the analysis of R&D&I efficiency, based on a dynamic network optimization model, where the analyzed periods present interdependence based on the relationships between the inputs and outputs of the R&D&I of SDG 9. To meet this objective, the output-oriented Dynamic DEA with Network structure based on SBM framework (DNSBM) is used under constant returns in order to first, verify how European countries are positioned in their contribution to realizing SDG 9; and, second, define the long-term relationships between them by applying the Cumulative Divisional Malmquist Index (CDMI) model. Therefore, an analysis of the efficiency of R&D&I, based on a dynamic network optimization model, was carried out, whereby the periods analyzed show interdependence based on the relationships between the inputs and outputs of R&D&I. The model that we propose in this paper aims to solve the problem that characterizes the measurement of the global dynamic efficiency of R&D&I over multiple periods (Chen et al., 2018 ), and in our case the study period is 2005–2019. To confirm the robustness of our results, we have completed the Global Efficiency analysis with an analysis of the Malmquist Index, taking into account that it is a dynamic model (Zhu et al., 2020 ). Therefore, these results make it possible to determine which European countries have grown or not in terms of their R&D&I policies during the period under study. This objective allows progress in the intelligent systems that are implemented in companies, not only for models that are aimed measuring efficiency in R&D&I, but also for models from other fields that require concepts whose analysis is based on dynamic and interdependent data (Zhang et al., 2023 ). In addition, as a second objective of the present work, a new conceptual model was developed, in order to measure efficiency in the management of R&D&I. There are studies on R&D&I in countries, cities, or regions (Rousseau and Rousseau, 1997; Nasierowski and Arcelus, 2003; Hollanders and Esser, 2007; Zabala-Iturriagagoitia et al., 2007; Cullmann et al., 2012; Matei and Aldea, 2012; Lee et al., 2020; Brodny et al., 2023 ), where those authors did not distinguish between quantity and scientific quality; that is, measuring efficiency by differentiating between scientific and research production, or knowledge generation and scientific quality, or its transfer phase. The model shown in the present study allows solving one of the main limitations identified by Carayannis et al. (2016)  in the measurement models of efficiency in R&D&I, with the result that producing a greater number of scientific articles is not necessarily related to a higher level of quality in scientific production. Therefore, the usefulness of the proposed model lies precisely in dividing the levels of efficiency into two divisions; on the one hand, the levels of efficiency for scientific production (i.e., the number of documents published in journals) and on the other hand, the quality and scientific impact of those publications (i.e., h-index, number of citations or patents). The data used in our study were extracted from the system of outputs and inputs of R&D&I in Europe during the period 2005–2019 (published by Eurostat), and specifically the data related to UN SDG 9, in relation to publications, citations, and h-index of European researchers, classified by country, in data published by Scival (Elsevier). The structure of the rest of this work is as follows. In section 2  a review of the literature of the common measures on R&D&I and on SDG 9 at the European level is carried out, collecting the existing studies in the body of literature on the measurement of R&D&I efficiency when applying the DEA methodology, which is the methodology used in the present study. Next, in section 3 , the longitudinal and cross-sectional R&D&I dynamic study framework is explained, proposing a dynamic network DEA model for multiple periods and presenting the empirical study of 32 European countries for the period of 2005 to 2019. Finally, the results, the discussion, and the conclusions are presented in the remaining sections.  2 Literature review 2.1 The importance of measuring R&D&I efficiency in European countries Currently, countries move in a dynamic environment that they must face if they want to continue growing and developing as a nation. Therefore, they must monitor, and respond flexibly to, the steps and strategies that are detected in that environment. Innovation has become one of the main objectives to achieve compliance with the SDGs (Bastien and Holmarsdottir, 2017; Chataway et al., 2017; Dahl-Andersen and Johnson, 2015; Schot and Steinmueller, 2018 ). Innovation and technological progress are key to discovering durable solutions to economic and environmental challenges, such as increasing energy and resource efficiency (United Nations Economic and Social Council, 2019 ). Orhan and Guajardo (2021)  explain the importance of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs) in developing countries, including the innovation goal. The United Nations SDG 9 states that policies have been carried out to promote innovation in the EU. According to a worldwide report published by the United Nations Economic and Social Council (2019) , investment in R&D&I as share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased from 1.5 % in 2000 to 1.7 % in 2015, and remained almost unchanged in 2017. To promote innovation and to achieve SDG 9, European institutions have reached a political agreement on Horizon Europe and the EU Research and Innovation Framework Program for the period of 2021–2027 (European Union, 2019 ). In addition, as an economic activity, innovation is a dynamic concept that requires a methodology which allows its performance to be measured over time (Tone and Tsutsui, 2014 ), and in the present study is supported by the Theory of Dynamic Efficiency (Kirzner, 1997, 1998 ). This theory explains that dynamic efficiency can be considered as the capacity of an economic system to promote creativity, innovation, and business coordination (North, 1990 ). For this reason, the Theory of Dynamic Efficiency demonstrates that in the analysis of economic efficiency of activities that evolve rapidly (such as innovation), the dynamic dimension should not be forgotten, since it is a basic element to be considered in all studies of economic efficiency, which not only opens a valuable field for future researchers in this discipline, but also results in the development of economic science in the service of humanity, which is much more high-yielding and dynamically efficient (Leibenstein, 1966; Robbins, 1972; Lipsey, 1973; North, 1999 ).  2.2 Measurement of R&D&I efficiency: the DEA methodology used by countries The measurement of innovation becomes a complex process since it affects different parts of the organization (Tidd and Bessant, 2020, chap. 1 ). In this sense, the methods that present a higher degree of precision in the measurement of efficiency are non-parametric (the most prominent being Data Envelopment Analysis, DEA), allowing to quantify the multiple innovation factors and obtain robust results on its impact on public and private organizations (Nasierowski and Arcelus, 2003 ). The DEA methodology has been used to measure the efficiency of some innovation factors in certain countries (Sharma and Thomas, 2008; Matei and Aldea, 2012 ). Because innovation is a relatively complex process that affects various activities of the organization, Network DEA has been applied in some studies to solve this problem (Chen and Guan, 2012; Guan and Chen, 2012; Carayannis et al., 2015 ), but it is mostly static in its approach. To study the effect of innovation in certain regions and countries (Zabala-Iturriagagoitia et al., 2007; Chen and Guan, 2012; Chen et al., 2018 ), two innovation processes (production and commercialization of knowledge) are used that affect various stages of their respective value chains (Carayannis et al., 2015 ). The Network DEA model is, therefore, an appropriate method with which to measure the impact of innovation in different geographical locations. Kotsemir (2013)  performed a bibliographic analysis on the most suitable variables that can be used to measure innovation using DEA models. Among them, inputs such as spending on innovation or R&D personnel over total GDP are noteworthy. As outputs, there are patents, high technology exports, or the number of publications. Broekel et al. (2018)  use a DEA model with shared inputs and outputs to explain the innovation efficiency of different regions of Germany using R&D employees as inputs and patents as outputs. Furthermore, it is necessary to explain why efficiency models are linked to innovation processes. Guan and Chen (2012)  undertook a study in which they identified Greece and Ireland as efficient countries in all the models they applied. Those authors concluded that being an innovative country resulted in a higher level of efficiency of that country in the use of physical, human, and financial resources that are directly related to innovation (Matei and Aldea, 2012; Nasierowski and Arcelus, 2012 ). However, Zabala-Iturriagagoitia et al. (2007)  note that in their study, having fewer resources did not mean countries would consequently achieve lower levels of efficiency in innovation because, with the few financial, physical, and human resources of certain regions, they were able to obtain more efficient results in innovation than regions with more resources whose results were less efficient (since they needed to use more resources to achieve results in innovation). Therefore, in some cases, countries with more stable innovation policies were unable to achieve better innovation efficiency results than countries with fewer resources. Carayannis et al. (2016)  note that in many cases a DEA model with several stages is used to measure innovation, because innovation efficiency requires a common set of inputs and outputs, which in many cases are considered intermediate inputs and outputs (Lewis and Sexton, 2004; Färe et al., 2007 ). Network DEA defines multiple stages or levels in the innovation model, allowing and helping to measure the efficiency of innovation management in certain countries, and the models in some studies are noteworthy (Wu et al., 2010; Lv, 2011; Cullmann et al., 2012; Choi et al., 2013; Chun et al., 2015; Kou et al., 2016 ). Table 1   shows the most relevant studies that measure the levels of efficiency in innovation at the international, national, regional, and local levels. Sharma and Thomas (2008)  use the number of researchers and R&D funding as a function of GDP (%) as input variables and publications and patents as output variables. Guan and Chen (2012)  use a Network DEA model with intermediate outputs such as the number of patents. One of the most recent works on innovation management in certain regions of Russia is by Zemtsov and Kotsemir (2019)  where they use a dynamic DEA with variables such as R&D expenses or the potential of knowledge of the region as a function of total GDP (%). Some authors (Sharma and Thomas, 2008; Pan et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2020 ) use the number of publications as final output variable. Based on the studies undertaken in recent years that were analyzed, we can affirm that innovation is a multidimensional concept and, in order to measure efficient management in innovation policies, the need to use models integrating factors that affect international innovation systems should be taken into account at the national, regional, and local levels (Carayannis et al., 2016 ). However, although the DEA methodology is widely used to measure R&D&I efficiency, there are other methodologies that also allow it to be measured. Prokop et al. (2019)  have used a logistic regression analysis to measure innovation collaboration networks in small countries, Meissner (2019)  has measured innovation cooperation through a qualitative methodology, Weerakoon et al. (2019)  have studied the creation of knowledge in innovation in companies using structural equations, and Prokop et al. (2021)  have evaluated the efficiency in national ecosystems through a two-step DEA model, using fsQCA (Fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis).   3 Empirical study 3.1 Objectives The objective of this study is to develop (i) a framework for the analysis of R&D&I efficiency based on a dynamic network optimization model, where the analyzed periods present interdependence based on the relationships between the inputs and outputs of the R&D&I of SDG 9, and (ii) a new conceptual model to measure efficiency in the management of R&D&I in countries by establishing two divisions: (1) the quantity of publications generated is indicated, or knowledge generation phase (Division 1 and Division 2 in period t in the model), and (2) the quality of these publications is measured (publication impact index), or knowledge transfer phase (Division 1 and Division 2 in the period t + 1 in the model). To meet these objectives, the output-oriented Dynamic DEA with Network structure based on SBM framework (DNSBM) is used under constant returns in order to first, verify how European countries are positioned in their contribution to realizing SDG 9, considering the dynamic relationships between the resources allocated to R&D&I and their results; and, second, define the long-term relationships between them by applying the Cumulative Divisional Malmquist Index (CDMI) model. European countries are administratively and economically independent geographical regions, and both the mobilization of the workforce and the operation of the entire innovation process occur at the national level. We have studied the R&D system in Europe in the dataset published by the European Commission and for this, panel and year data are used during the period of 2005–2019 to monitor the SDGs. In order to promote the strategy to achieve the SDGs at the European level and build a more innovative Europe, the European Commission began to record the performance of the UN SDG 9 in 2005 through indicators linked to development.  3.2 Indicators and measurements The analysis is based on Eurostat data for the period of 2005 to 2019 for 32 European countries. SDG 9 recognizes the importance of technological progress and innovation in finding durable solutions to social, economic, and environmental challenges. Monitoring SDG 9 in the EU context focuses on the progress made in strengthening R&D&I and promoting sustainable transport. Based on these objectives, the variables used in the model are shown in Table 2  .  3.3 DEA methodology: dynamic DEA with network structure based on SBM framework (DNSBM) The DNSBM is the composite of network SBM (NSBM) and dynamic SBM (DSBM) (Tone and Tsutsui, 2014 ). Mariz et al. (2018)  note that there is an increase in the number of publications with Dynamic Data Envelopment Analysis (DDEA) models in recent years. We suggest using the efficiency evaluation, taking into account the vertical relationships, which consist of different efficiency models with different inputs and outputs connected through Links. We have called each of the groupings of indicators Divisions, as define by those authors. The horizontal relationships are made by combining the previous network structure with the carry-over between periods, or carry-over variables. In this case, we measure the efficiency of the European countries, taking into account: (a) The global efficiency in the entire period under observation, (b) the dynamic change that occurs in the efficiency of the period, and (c) the dynamic change within each Division. This model can be oriented to (i) both inputs and outputs, or (ii) both constant returns to scale (CRS) or variables (VRS). One of the possibilities of dynamic analysis is the application of a new Malmquist Divisional index. In Fig. 1   we have collected the Dynamic DEA with Network structure (Tone and Tsutsui, 2014 ). The DMUs “n” (j = 1, …, n) of each Division “K” (k = 1, …, K) are in each period of time T (t = 1, …, T). For each link that leads from Division “k” to Division “h” by (k, h) and the set of links by “L”, the inputs and outputs and link variables are the following: i) Inputs and outputs: X ijk  t  ∈   R +     i = 1 , K , m k  ; j = 1 , K , n ; k = 1 , K , K    ; t = 1 , K ,  T )    (input resource “i”  to DMUj   for Division “k”  in period “t” ) (1) Y ijk  t  ∈   R +     i = 1 , K , r k  ; j = 1 , K , n ; k = 1 , K , K    ; t = 1 , K , T )    (output product “i”  from DMUj , Division “k” , in period “t” ). (2) ii) Links:(3) Z j ( k h )  l   t  ∈   R +     j = 1 , K , n ; l = 1 , K , L kh   ; t = 1 , K , K    ; t = 1 , K ,  T )       This links the intermediate products between the DMUs from the Division “k”  to Division “h ” in period “t ”, where Lkh  is the number of variables from “k”  to “h ”. iii) Carry-overs:(4) Z jk  l   ( t , t + 1 )   ∈   R +     j = 1 , K , n ; l = 1 , K , L k  ; k = 1 , K , K ; t = 1 , K ,     T - 1 )       From DMUj  of Division “k” , from period “t ” to period t  + 1, where LK  is the number of indicators in the carry-over from Division “k” ). Related activities are treated as output from the preceding Division to the next.(5) z  o k h    o u t  t  = Z  k h   o u t  t  λ k  t  - s  o k h    o u t  t  ( k h    o u t = 1 , ⋯ linkout  k  )      where s  o k h    o u t  t  ∈ R  L k h   o u t       is slacks-based and non-negative and linkoutk   is the number of “as output” links from Division “k ”. The overall efficiency would be equal to:θ o  ∗   = m i n ∑ t = 1  T  W  t  ∑ k = 1  K  w  k  1 - 1 m k  + linkin  k  + nbad  k    ∑ i = 1  m k   s  iok  t -   x  iok  t   + ∑ k , h    l  = 1  linkin  k   s  o k , h     l    i n  t  z  o k , h     l    i n  t   + ∑ k l  = 1  nbad  k   s  ok  l    b a d  ( t , t + 1 )   z  ok  l    b a d  ( t , t + 1 )              ∑ t = 1  T  W  t  ∑ k = 1  K  w  k  1 - 1 r k  + linkout  k  + ngood  k    ∑ i = 1  r k   s  iok  t +   y  iok  t   + ∑ k , h    l  = 1  linkout  k   s  o k , h     l    o u t  t  z  o k , h     l    o u t  t   + ∑ k l  = 1  ngood  k   s  ok  l    g o o d  ( t , t + 1 )   z  ok  l    g o o d  ( t , t + 1 )                     with ∑ t = 1  T  W  t  = 1 , ∑ k = 1  K  w  k  = 1 , W  t  ≥ 0 ∀ t    , w  k  ≥ 0 ∀ k      , where W  t  ( t = 1 , K ,  T )     is the weight of period t”  y w  k  ( k = 1 , K ,  K )     is the weight of Division “k ”. The efficiency of each period is defined as follows:Ʈ o  t  ∗    = ∑ k = 1  K  w  k  1 - 1 m k  + linkin  k  + nbad  k    ∑ i = 1  m k   s  iok  t -   x  iok  t   + ∑ k , h    l  = 1  linkin  k   s  o k , h     l  i n  t  z  o k , h     l  i n  t   + ∑ k l  = 1  nbad  k   s  ok  l  b a d  ( t , t + 1 )   z  ok  l  b a d  ( t , t + 1 )           ∑ k = 1  K  w  k  1 - 1 r k  + linkout  k  + ngood  k    ∑ i = 1  r k   s  iok  t +   y  iok  t   + ∑ k , h    l  = 1  linkout  k   s  o k , h     l  o u t  t  z  o k , h     l  o u t  t   + ∑ k l  = 1  ngood  k   s  ok  l  g o o d  ( t , t + 1 )   z  ok  l  g o o d  ( t , t + 1 )            ( t )  = 1 , K  , T )       On the other hand, p, the efficiency of each Division is defined as:ρ ok  t  ∗    =  1 - 1 m k  + linkin  k  + nbad  k    ∑ i = 1  m k   s  iok  t -   x  iok  t   + ∑ k , h    l  = 1  linkin  k   s  o k , h     l    i n  t  z  o k , h     l    i n  t   + ∑ k l  = 1  nbad  k   s  ok  l    b a d  ( t , t + 1 )   z  ok  l    b a d  ( t , t + 1 )        1 - 1 r k  + linkout  k  + ngood  k    ∑ i = 1  r k   s  iok  t +   y  iok  t   + ∑ k , h    l  = 1  linkout  k   s  o k , h     l    o u t  t  z  o k , h     l    o u t  t   + ∑ k l  = 1  ngood  k   s  ok  l    g o o d  ( t , t + 1 )   z  ok  l    g o o d  ( t , t + 1 )           ( k = 1 , K  , K ; t = 1 , K  , T )       The efficiency will be different for each Division in each period. In our case, having used an output-oriented model in this study, the global efficiency will be the geometric mean of the efficiencies of all the Divisions.  3.4 New Malmquist index based on the period-divisional efficiency score In this paper, we define a Malmquist index based on the period-divisional efficiency score (Keikha-Javan and Rostamy-Malkhalifeh, 2014 ), as follows. i) Divisional catch-up index (DCU). We calculate the relationship between division-period efficiencies “t” and “t + 1” using the catch-up index as follows:DCU = γ ok  t → t + 1   = ρ ok  t + 1  ∗    ρ ok  t  ∗          t = 1 , K  , T - 1 ; k = 1 , K  , K ; o = 1 , K , n    .     DCU > 1, DCU = 1, DCU and DCU < 1 indicate progress, status quo and regression in catch-up effect, respectively. ii) Divisional frontier-shift effect (DFS) . We will study the effect on each border of each Division through the indicator: the divisional frontier-shift effect of σ ok  t → t + 1     . iii) Divisional Malmquist index (DMI ), Overall Malmquist index (OMI ) and Cumulative Malmquist index (CDMI ). Taking into consideration the previous indicators, we will define the Divisional Malmquist index (DMI) by their product:DMI = D C U × D F S = μ ok  t → t + 1   = γ ok  t → t + 1   σ ok  t → t + 1   t = 1 , K  , T - 1 ; k = 1 , K  , K ; o = 1 , K , n         The overall Malmquist index (OMI ) is obtained through the geometric mean of the Divisional Malmquist index (DMI )(11) OMI = μ o  = π k = 1  K  ( μ ok   )  w k   ( o = 1 , K , n )      where μ ok      is the weighted geometric mean of μ ok  t → t + 1   ( t = 1 , K  , T - 1 )     and w k  ≥ 0    is the weight of division “k ” with ∑ k = 1  K  w k  = 1   . The Cumulative Divisional Malmquist Index (CDMI ) would be:(12) CDMI = ξ ok  1 → T   = π t = 1  T - 1   μ ok  t → t + 1   ( o = 1 , K , n : k = 1 , K , K )      and the Cumulative Overall Malmquist Index (COMI ) would be:(13) COMI = ξ o  1 → T   = π k = 1  K  ξ ok  1 → T      w k   ( o = 1 , K , n )      CDMI turns out to be:(14) CDMI = μ ok  1 → T   × π t = 2  T - 1   φ ok  t       The intertemporal efficiency change between Period 1 and Period T  will be modified at each moment of the different periods.   4 Estimation of R&D&I efficiency in Europe. Proposal for dynamic DEA with network structure based on SBM framework (DNSBM) and Divisional Malmquist index (DMI) In this section we apply the DNSBM model, obtaining both the Global Efficiency Indices (GEI ) by countries, as well as the Divisional Malmquist Index (DMI ) and the Cumulative Divisional Malmquist Index (CDMI ). With this model we aim to measure and study R&D&I dynamically in the network over a period of 15 years (2005–2019). Although most approaches consider the innovation system as a single system, using a deeper approach an innovation system can be considered as being composed of two sub-processes. According to Chen et al. (2018)  a knowledge production process (KPP) is responsible for the transformation of inputs related to research into knowledge results. This multi-stage approach is consistent with several innovation efficiency studies (see, for example, Guan and Chen, 2012; Liu et al., 2014 ). In a second stage, Chen et al. (2018)  recognize a knowledge commercialization process (KCP) that is transformed into knowledge results and commercial/monetary results. This process also takes place on multiple levels. It is important to consider the intertemporal dependence that influences the production ratio of the multi-period R&D&I system. When dealing with multiple interrelated periods, overall efficiency must be measured dynamically, in consecutive periods, otherwise the resulting efficiency measures will be misleading. In terms of the multi-stage production process over multiple periods, we have used the dynamic DEA model in order to model the national R&D efficiency of multiple periods. The model used is oriented to output under constant returns. In this study, we use simultaneous measures of general efficiency and all period-specific efficiencies; specifically, the Tone and Tsutsui model (Tone and Tsutsui, 2014 ) based on the traditional SBM model in which we are dealing with multiple countries connected by network structure links within each period and, horizontally, we combine the network structure by means of transfer activities between two successive periods. As Chen et al. (2018)  point out, this model can evaluate (1) the general efficiency during the whole observed period, (2) the dynamic change of the efficiency of the period, and (3) the dynamic change of the efficiency by countries. Specifically, Fig. 2   shows the dynamic network DEA model proposed in this work. In the proposed model, and illustrated in Fig. 2 , we represent how the efficiency of R&D&I is measured in several interconnected periods, both vertically and horizontally, where the DMUs are the 32 European countries analyzed. The horizontal network (or transfer) is composed of the input variables in period t  that will be treated as outputs in period t  + 1. A knowledge production process (KPP) is responsible for the transformation of inputs related to research into knowledge results in period t. This multi-stage approach is consistent with several innovation efficiency studies (Guan and Chen, 2012; Liu et al., 2014; Carayannis et al., 2016 ). In a second stage, Chen et al. (2018)  recognize a knowledge commercialization process (KCP) that is transformed into knowledge results and Knowledge transference in the period t + 1. This process also takes place on multiple levels. The vertical network in Period t connects the efficiency of the DMUs analyzed. In our model, Division 1 in period t is made up of the input variables: Gross domestic expenditure on R&D by sector and Human resources in science and technology, with the Output variable being the number of R&D personnel by sector. In Division 2 in period t, the input is: number of R&D personnel by sector and the output is: number of Documents.  The efficiency carry-over variable from one period to another (carry-over variable) is the “number of R&D personnel” by sector from one period to the next. Numerous studies consider R&D&I personnel to be the real driving force behind the efficiency of these activities, and there is currently great concern in the scientific field over increasing the recruitment of researchers in Europe (Çağlar and Gürel, 2019; Revuelta-Bordoy et al., 2021 ). In Period t + 1 we will consider this variable to be the scientific production of the country analyzed in the global R&D&I system and, therefore, the variable that carries efficiency from one period to another. In the first Division in period t + 1, the quantity of published research papers is indicated, while in the second Division in period t + 1, the quality of these publications is measured: Patents, Citations, and the h-index of researchers at the national level. The divisions correspond to the R&D&I production system of each country and in each period, from t  and t  + 1… t  + n. The production system corresponds, therefore, to each relationship between the set of inputs in period t  and the production outputs in period t  + 1 (in our study the link between the inputs and outputs will again be the number of R&D personnel by sector).  5 Results The results are presented, taking into account that the Malmquist productivity index is an index representing Total Factor Productivity (TFP) of growth of each country, reflecting: a) The progression or regression in efficiency along with b) The progression or regression of the frontier technology. Table 3   shows the Overall Malmquist Index (OMI ), equation (13)  and, the Cumulative Divisional Malmquist Index (CDMI ) (equation (14)  in the complete period of fifteen years and for Divisions 1 and 2. The ranking by countries for each indicator is also reflected. The Overall Scores (OS ) are also collected (equation 6). In Table 3 , we observe that the countries obtaining the highest efficiency scores are Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, and in the OS ranking they are placed in first, second, and third place, respectively. In Division 1 (related to the amount of scientific production), the countries obtaining the most efficiency were Luxembourg, Denmark, and Finland. In Division 2 (related to the quality of scientific production), the most efficient countries were Switzerland, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The countries with the highest Overall Malmquist Index (OMI ) were: Estonia, Luxembourg, and Norway. It is observed that these countries have experienced an increase in efficiency over the years, and on a continuous basis. The Cumulative Divisional Malmquist Index (CDMI ) also indicates that these countries have had the most growth in the last 15 years, which is an expected result given the nature of the index and its method of calculation. Table 4     shows the results of the dynamic efficiency, the efficiency scores, the indices related to technological changes (DCU ), equation (10) and the changes in the frontier (DFS ), and equation (11)  during the years analyzed. With regards to the increase in efficiency due to technological change in the Division 1 model, the countries with geometric means above 1 (DCU > 1), have all been affected except for Cyprus, Iceland, and Switzerland. In this case, the countries that have grown the most have been Italy, Ireland, Hungary, and Denmark. In the Division 2 model, there is a total of 13 countries with geometric means greater than 1 (DCU > 1). The DFS (Divisional frontier-shift effect) indicator has performed worse than the change in efficiency. In the Division 1 model, all countries, with the exception of Latvia and Slovakia, decreased the efficiency of R&D during the 15 years analyzed, leaving Luxembourg very close to 1 (the country with the highest growth in the Division). In the Division 2 model, the countries that have increased efficiency the most have been the Netherlands, Germany, and France, followed by Latvia, Slovakia, and Luxembourg. Graph 1  , shown below, shows the geometric mean of the dynamic productivity indicators OMI and CDMI for all years. The countries with the best results, and therefore those with the highest growth, have been Estonia, Luxembourg, and Norway, and the countries with the lowest growth have been Croatia, Italy, and Slovenia. Subsequently, the descriptive data of the previous indices are shown in Tables A1, A2, A3, and A4  in Appendix A. As can be seen in Table 5 , Spearman’s correlation index between global efficiency and the OMI has been −0.3393. This corroborates the results explained above: those countries that have experienced the highest growth over the 15 years have not necessarily been the most efficient in the period analyzed. Once the growth levels have been analyzed in terms of productivity, the dynamic efficiency will be analyzed. The dynamic efficiencies in the network of European countries give rise to results of optimization of R&D and the Human Resources linked to it. To determine the distance to the dynamic efficiency frontier, in Table 6  we have collected the % deviation with respect to the data observed in all the input and output indicators of Division 1 and Division 2, for each country. The geometric mean of the % deviation is calculated for the 15 years. In order to better observe the behaviour of the inputs and outputs of each Division by country, in Fig. 6 we have represented the geometric mean of the dynamic deviation. As can be seen in Table 6 , on the Input side the best performing countries in the first model (Division 1) have been Luxembourg and Finland, and on the Output side, Switzerland and Germany. This indicates that these countries have been more efficient, considering both economic and human resources in R&D at the national level, in relation to scientific production during the period analyzed. In the case of the model (Division 2), the countries that have best managed their R&D resources have been Switzerland and Germany, the latter being the country obtaining the best results in scientific production, patents, number of citations and h-index of researchers (highest level of scientific quality), followed by the Czech Republic and Italy. The geometric mean of the inputs, or use of economic and human resources in R&D, indicates that the most efficient countries in the 15 years analyzed have been: Luxembourg, Finland and Denmark. However, these countries still need to improve their scientific production in the number of publications, patents, and citations received by researchers, as well as an increase in the country’s global h-index (the quality levels of its scientific production). Regarding the countries that have been efficient from the perspective of scientific production, patents, citations and h-index they have been: Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. However, they could increase efficiency in relation to the volume of resources used in R&D compared to Luxembourg, Finland, or Denmark. Graph 2  , displayed below, represents these data by country. These data provide a window on the countries obtaining the lowest deviation, in terms of percentage in R&D expenditures and R&D personnel, with respect to the rest of the countries. They have not been the countries with the most growth in their contribution to the SDG 9, as reflected in the Malmquist productivity indexes in the 15 years analyzed. This explains why countries such as Luxembourg are growing in terms of innovation policies, but are still far from the Innovation Efficiency frontier unlike Germany or Italy, for example.  6 Discussion The discussion of the results will be carried out based on two aspects: (1) the contribution of the DNSBM and the OMI indices: Overall Malmquist Divisional Score and the Cumulative Divisional Malmquist Index (CDMI), and (2) the discussion of the dynamic results obtained in relation to SDG 9 of the European countries, focusing on R&D&I. 6.1 The contribution of the DNSBM and the OMI indices The gap between efficiency and innovation has been widely discussed in the body of literature on innovation. Its existence is justified due to the complexity of the innovation process, which makes its precision and modelling difficult. Mahroum and Al-Saleh (2013)  note that it is quite difficult to measure the learning, adoption, and adaptation of knowledge taking place within the innovation process (Carayannis and Alexander, 2002 ). The DNSBM model aims to solve the problem that characterizes the measurement of the dynamic global efficiency of R&D&I over multiple periods (2005–2019) (Chen et al., 2018 ). In our study, a set of weightings is obtained after the decomposition of the efficiencies of the periods, which are specific to each of the countries analyzed. This differs from the work of Tone and Tsutsui (2014) , where a set of preset weights is supplied exogenously and is common for all DMUs. In R&D&I models it is often difficult to pre-specify the weights, since the importance of each period can be difficult to understand or measure. To confirm the robustness of our results, we have completed the Global Efficiency analysis with an analysis of the Malmquist Index, both global and by Divisions, taking into account that it is a dynamic model (Zhu et al., 2020 ). These results do not allow knowing the productivity growth of each country, but determine the progress or decline of efficiency along the technological frontier, using a sample with panel data (2005–2019) for R&D&I in Europe. Therefore, it allows us to explain which countries have grown considerably in terms of their R&D&I policies during the period under study. One of the objectives of this work is to formulate a new model (DNSBM) that allows to measure global efficiency using the number of R&D personnel by sector and by countries as the “carry-out” variable. The model used has been the one oriented to output, since the variable “number of documents” is considered to be an output in all innovation studies (Pan et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2011; Emrouznejad and Yang, 2018 ). To the best of our knowledge, all this has allowed us to carry out a unique study to date in the body of literature, divided into two blocks: in the first block is the Division, and the scientific production of each country is measured quantitatively (Audretsch and Keilbach, 2004; Zemtsov and Kotsemir, 2019 ), and in the second block is the scientific quality in order to discriminate between published documents that have had a significant impact among the scientific community, or from which patents have been derived (Carayannis et al., 2015; Jurickova et al., 2019; Min et al., 2020 ).  6.2 Dynamic results obtained in relation to SDG 9 of the European countries focusing on R&D&I On the other hand, we discuss the results obtained from R&D&I efficiency by country, observing that the efficiency in terms of scientific and research production correspond to the countries that have achieved the best results; and these countries are: Luxembourg, Denmark, and Finland. This coincides with the results published by Zabala-Iturriagagoitia et al. (2007) . However, those authors did not distinguish between quantity and scientific quality. In turn, Germany and Switzerland have a relatively high overall efficiency in terms of scientific quality (Rousseau and Rousseau, 1997; Nasierowski and Arcelus, 2003; Hollanders and Esser, 2007; Cullmann et al., 2012; Matei and Aldea, 2012 ). Carayannis et al. (2016)  confirm this result, which explains our model and makes it useful; it is not by producing a greater quantity of scientific articles that one can obtain greater efficiency related to quality. In this case, the usefulness of the proposed model lies precisely in dividing into divisions efficiency derived from the amount of scientific production for R&D&I expenses, and the number of scientists employed, with respect to quality and impact. The efficiency results in the proposed model indicate that Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Switzerland are the most efficient countries. This indicates that the DEA (DNSBM) model assigns a higher weight to those countries having a higher scientific quality. On the other hand, we have also analyzed the Malmquist Index, in order to know which European countries have grown in relation to the investment policies of the EU R&D&I. In this sense, the results show that the countries which have grown the most have been: Estonia, Luxembourg, and Norway. However, these countries remain considerably poorly positioned relative to frontier levels of production. By way of example, according to the EU (European Union, 2021 ), Luxembourg is the country that has grown the most in recent years in eco-innovation policies, which corroborates the results of our study in relation to productivity growth in the European countries.   7 Conclusions Currently, R&D plays an important role in the competitiveness of European countries, due to the added value it entails for the economy: obtaining sustainable growth, increasing productivity, and efficient use of all resources (Ferreira et al., 2021 ). For this reason, the European Union has incorporated into its statistical data (Eurostat), indicators related to R&D&I and, explicitly, data on the UN SDG 9. This SDG is related to R&D&I carried out by EU countries, as it is considered very useful for political decision-makers when making decisions on their future policies. In the present study, a Dynamic DEA with Network structure based on SBM framework (DNSBM) is proposed and applied to R&D&I in Europe. The advantages of this model in the application of R&D&I efficiency are found in the dynamic relationships that DNSBM enables between the resources allocated to these activities and their results over time, since it allows measuring their efficiency by tracing a network of relationships between its inputs and outputs, and optimizing the efficiency of its processes. This work shows the networks of relationships between the two processes of generation of scientific knowledge: the production of science and its commercialization in the form of quality of scientific results and its impact on efficiency. The results of the proposed model show that there is a clear difference between the quantity and quality of scientific production. The countries with the highest scientific production are: Luxembourg, Denmark, and Finland, while those with the highest scientific quality are: Germany and Switzerland. In addition, it is observed that Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Switzerland are the most efficient countries in terms of innovation policies (since they are the countries closer to the efficiency frontier) while Estonia, Luxembourg, and Norway are the countries with the highest growth during the period under study (2005–2019). 7.1 Implications for practice This work can guide R&D&I investment policies in Europe, favouring those countries that are continuously making the greatest efforts in the development of these activities over time, and not only for those countries that, although they achieved best results in efficiency, that have the least growth in R&D&I. In order to contribute to SDG 9, regarding innovation according to the results obtained, the implications for increasing the efficiency of R&D&I in the countries that have grown the least in the period analyzed would be, on the one hand, greater investment in economic and human resources at the national level, which would give rise to greater scientific production, and on the other hand, the improvement of the management of resources in R&D&I, as is observed in the present study, and which would lead to better results in scientific production, a greater number of patents, and a greater impact of publications by country. Finally, from the perspective of the contribution to the studies carried out to date on Dynamic Network models, the present work can help other researchers to use the Malmquist Divisional models because, to our knowledge, very few models are used in the literature on efficiency measurement, in general, and on the measurement of R&D&I efficiency, in particular. Therefore, through this model we can disseminate knowledge to other researchers, thus advancing a method of quantifying dynamic efficiency, and more specifically regarding R&D&I.
