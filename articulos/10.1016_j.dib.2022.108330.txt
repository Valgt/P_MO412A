                  The dataset concerning the Japan Household Panel Survey on Sustainable Development Goals (JHPSDGs) was collected through online surveys conducted in March 2019 and March 2020. The dataset consists of 12,098 observations, including two-period panel datasets of 3,227 individuals. The JHPSDGs include a wide range of individual survey responses, which allows researchers and policymakers to investigate a variety of social science research topics, including but not limited to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) awareness, pro-sustainable behavior, and labor market decision-making. The variables include detailed demographic information, labor market information, SDG awareness, sustainable and financial decision-making, and personality traits. The dataset can be used to conduct quantitative analyses, especially in the areas of business, economics, and psychology. The dataset is available to the public via the Harvard Dataverse and provides access to questionnaires, codebooks, data, and descriptive statistics.

Prod. 292, 125932. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.125932         Value of the Data • The dataset is a comprehensive household panel survey of representative samples collected from Japan. The dataset consists of 12,098 observations, including two-period panel datasets of 3,227 individuals. The original intention of the authors was to conduct research on the SDGs. However, the dataset includes comprehensive socio-demographic variables, and there are potentially many research topics that users can investigate using this dataset.  • Researchers and policymakers can use this dataset to analyze a wide range of topics. Specifically, social scientists in the areas of business, economics, and psychology may find the dataset beneficial for conducting analyses.  • The dataset can also be used to examine individual behaviors concerning the SDGs, such as sustainable decision-making, consumer behavior, labor market participation, and gender equality. The SDGs are a set of 17 global goals aimed at achieving a sustainable society by requiring global citizens to transform their behavior. The dataset contains general SDG awareness levels and variables related to Goals 4 (quality education), 5 (gender equality), 8 (decent work and economic growth), and 12 (responsible consumption and production).     1 Data Description The dataset of the Japan Household Panel Survey on Sustainable Development Goals (JHPSDGs) was collected through online surveys conducted in March 2019 and March 2020. In these online surveys, respondents were requested to participate in 1) a conjoint survey, and 2) a household survey. For conjoint surveys, please refer to our previous work [1 ,2] . The dataset described in the current paper comprises household surveys. As provided in the Specifications Table (above), a part of the dataset was used in the paper; however, as this dataset includes a wide range of variables, researchers may find it useful for their research. The dataset consists of 12,098 observations, including two-period panel datasets of 3,227 individuals. Table 1   presents the sample size based on the demographic quotas used in the survey. The questionnaire and codebook – in Japanese and their English translations – are available on the repository website alongside the report on the descriptive statistics and the dataset [3] . The data available in the repository include the raw survey response data in both csv and dta formats. Fig. 1   presents the distribution of the respondents’ total household income along with data from Japan's National Livelihood Survey (NLS) to illustrate the representativeness of the JHPSDGs. In the JHPSDGs, respondents selected the most suitable choice from the categorical variables, as presented in Table 1 . In the NLS, respondents reported their actual income. We recategorized the NLS responses using a disclosed report [4]  to ensure compatibility with the JHPSDGs. Data collection for the NLS was cancelled, and no data were available for 2020. Although respondents in the JHPSDGs tended to have a higher income, the income distributions of the sample and population appear to be similar. Table 2   presents a list of all variables included in the dataset. Using “year” and “rakutenid” variables, users can construct a panel dataset. The variable “rakutenid” is the identification number given to each respondent, whereas “panel” indicates if the observation is a panel dataset. A value of 1 indicates the observation occurred in both years and 0 indicates that the observation is not a panel. The variables we collected include:• Household composition  • Number of children  • The highest education completed and corresponding major of the respondent, their spouse, and their parents  • Work and employment statuses of respondents’ first and current jobs, that of their spouses, and their parents  • Total annual household income, respondents’ individual incomes, and the income goal that the household aims for  • Job-seeking status of respondents and their spouses as well as their reservation wage  • Household assets and debt  • Big Five personality traits (Japanese version of the Ten Item Personality Inventory [5] )  • Beliefs and attitudes toward a sustainable lifestyle, pro-environmental behavior, female participation in society, economic growth, and the role of government  • SDG awareness  • Decision-making regarding the purchase of durable and daily goods and regarding savings and investments     2 Experimental Design, Materials and Methods 2.1 Survey design When we developed the questionnaire for household surveys, we referred to national household survey initiatives, including the Japan Household Panel Survey on the Consumer Preferences and Satisfaction (JHPS-CPS) [6] , the Japanese Life Course Panel Survey (JLPS) [7] , the Japanese General Social Surveys (JGSS) Project [8] , and national-level large-scale surveys, including the Employment Status Survey (ESS) [9] , Consumer Awareness Baseline Survey (CABS) [10] , and the Dentsu Consumer Survey on SDGs (DCS-SDGs) [11] . Table 2  presents the sources for where and how the JHDSDGs adopted questions. Using the online survey platform, Qualtrics, we developed a device-friendly survey website. The survey screen given to each respondent was optimized based on the device used.  2.2 Data collection An online survey was conducted in March 2019 and March 2020. Quota sampling was used to construct a representative demographic dataset. Fig. 2   shows the overall flow of data collection. For both years, we first set a convenience sample size of 6,000 adults aged 18-74 years. Based on Japan's demographics, we determined 168 quota groups (5-year age groups × sex × regional blocs = 12 × 2 × 7), as shown in Table 1 . In Japan, the 47 prefectures are categorized into seven regional blocs. First, we divided the patients into seven groups based on regional blocs, then into two groups based on sex, and finally into 12 5-year age groups. Based on the Japanese population census, the targeted sample size for each quota group was determined. We assigned Rakuten Insight Inc. (Rakuten), one of the largest research companies in Japan, to provide respondents from a pool of panelists in which over 2.2 million Japanese are registered [12] . As of April 1, 2018, Rakuten had 2,212,088 registered panelists, of which 50.7% were female and 49.3% were male [12] . To understand the characteristics of its own panelist pool, Rakuten conducted a study comparing it with the national census, and several surveys were collected offline through random sampling [13] . Compared with the national population census regarding resident location, household characteristics, housing status, and employment, the Rakuten panelist pool consists of relatively more residents of Kanto, which includes Tokyo and its neighboring prefectures, married couples only households, and employed males; however, the distributions of both the Rakuten panelist pool and the census are similar [13] . Compared with the Public Opinion Survey on the Life of the People regarding standard of living and life satisfaction, the Rakuten panelist pool consists of more panelists claiming a median standard of living, that quality of life remained the same, and that the prospects for quality of life in the future would remain the same [13] . Regarding media outlet exposure, the Rakuten panelist pool consisted of more Internet users and fewer traditional media users, such as newspapers, TV, and radio, compared with the Media Preference Survey respondents [13] . In 2019, Rakuten sent its panelists an invitation email, guiding them to the Rakuten survey website with access to the Qualtrics survey link, which was linked to the survey screen that we developed. After each quota was filled, the link was closed so that additional invitees could no longer access the survey and data collection was completed from the filled quota. In total, 6,043 of the 8,957 participants completed the surveys. In 2020, invitations were sent to 6,043 respondents who completed the survey in 2019. Of these, 4,270 participated and 3,227 completed the survey. Different panelists were invited to fulfil the quota allocations. Among them, 4,206 participated and 2,828 were completed. The 2019 method was used to fill the planned quota for 2020.
