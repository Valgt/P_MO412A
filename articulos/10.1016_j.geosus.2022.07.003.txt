                  Challenges faced by African countries in achieving the goals of sustainable development are similar and transboundary. Previous analysis of Africa’s progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has largely been non-spatial, reducing the ability to find spatial relationships between countries and SDGs to help cooperation and proffer country-specific interventions. This study adopted techniques of exploratory and inferential spatial statistics to assess the successes of African countries from 2016 to 2020 in achieving the goals of sustainable development. Also, the study sought to understand how the spatial synergies and trade-offs between SDGs vary per country and time. The results revealed that spatial hotspots of countries with high SDGs scores were mostly confined to northern African countries with significant coldspots within central and eastern Africa and few patches in western and southern Africa for 2016. In 2020, the number of countries forming hotspots reduced, with Central African countries as significant cold spots. Five main spatial relationships: positive linear, negative linear, concave, convex and undefined complex, were found among countries and the SDGs. However, these spatial relationships were fluid as they changed over time and with different levels of influence from 2016 to 2020. The study concludes that generic solutions and policies by development agencies, governments, development finance instiutions and other impact investors will not be enough in achieving the SDGs because of the spatial heterogeneity of the continent. Tailored and country-specific policies based on results of spatial statistics matter.

Challenges faced by African countries in achieving the goals of sustainable development are similar and transboundary. Previous analysis of Africa’s progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has largely been non-spatial, reducing the ability to find spatial relationships between countries and SDGs to help cooperation and proffer country-specific interventions. This study adopted techniques of exploratory and inferential spatial statistics to assess the successes of African countries from 2016 to 2020 in achieving the goals of sustainable development. Also, the study sought to understand how the spatial synergies and trade-offs between SDGs vary per country and time. The results revealed that spatial hotspots of countries with high SDGs scores were mostly confined to northern African countries with significant coldspots within central and eastern Africa and few patches in western and southern Africa for 2016. In 2020, the number of countries forming hotspots reduced, with Central African countries as significant cold spots. Five main spatial relationships: positive linear, negative linear, concave, convex and undefined complex, were found among countries and the SDGs. However, these spatial relationships were fluid as they changed over time and with different levels of influence from 2016 to 2020. The study concludes that generic solutions and policies by development agencies, governments, development finance instiutions and other impact investors will not be enough in achieving the SDGs because of the spatial heterogeneity of the continent. Tailored and country-specific policies based on results of spatial statistics matter.   Graphical Abstract Image, graphical abstract       Keywords Africa  Development  Sustainable development  Spatial analysis  Hotspots  Random forest    1 Introduction 1.1 Background Despite progress made, income, food and energy poverty, poor access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), gender inequality, limited partnership and collaboration among institutions remain teething problems facing the world, with African countries being the most affected (Nhamo et al., 2019 ; Mugagga and Nabaasa, 2016 ). For instance, over 70 percent of African countries are energy poor, and about 40 percent struggle with unemployment. The problems have worsened following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, as 39 million Africans fell into extreme poverty by the end of 2021 (Anyanwu and Salami, 2021 ). However, significant variations exist across countries in the sub-region on the prevalence and severity of the above mentioned problems (Sustainable Development Goals Center for Africa, 2019 ). For instance, it is projected that 19.3 percent of Eritreans have access to basic water service, while 70 percent of populations in Madagascar, Zimbabwe, and South Sudan are poor (Sustainable Development Goals Center for Africa, 2019 ). Respectively, Somalia, Libya and Sudan have over 30.3, 28.5 and 6.5 of 100,000 deaths per year due to conflict and terrorism. Most analytical efforts such as descriptive (Diaz-Sarachaga et al., 2018 ), correlation (Warchold et al., 2021 ), clustering (Türkeli et al., 2020 ), regression (Dotun-Olujinmi et al., 2021 ; Tesema et al., 2021 ), structural equation modelling (Denny et al., 2018 ), gap (Bjegovic-Mikanovic, 2019 ), content (Chirambo, 2018 ), and network analyses (Jiménez-Aceituno et al., 2020 ) have not been able to explain the significant variations existing across countries in terms of development as they are less spatially orientated (Li et al., 2020 ; Nabiyeva and Wheeler, 2020 ; Otekunrin et al., 2019 ; Cling et al., 2018 ; Ogu et al., 2016 ). Also, the conventional analysis constraints the ability of governments, donor partners and impact investors in factoring space in designing Africa’s developmental interventions, understanding synergies and trade-offs, and monitoring the SDGs (Golding et al., 2017 ). To solve this weakness there is a call for spatial analysis for understanding Africa’s development challenges by the United Nations since 1991 (Li et al., 2020 ). However, this is yet to be fully explored as only about 5 percent of journals on development have a spatial orientation (Nabiyeva and Wheeler, 2020 ). While this 5 percent of research in the spatial bracket is commendable, their foci is micro and meso in nature, with concentrations on local communities, counties, districts, regions, and country levels without a comprehensive outlook of the continent (Azage et al., 2020 ; Nhamo et al., 2019 ; Armah et al., 2018 ; Mugagga and Nabaasa, 2016 ). Others tried a continent-level spatial analysis approach but were limited to selected SDGs without a comprehensive outlook of all SDGs and their interaction (Golding et al., 2017 ). Factors accounting for the low spatial statistical approach to understanding African development problems include data unavailability, usability of spatial data, software’s availability and cost, technical expertise, and technological infrastructure (Kussul et al., 2020 ; Jaiyesimi, 2016 ).  1.2 Literature in relevant context The concept of space is the heartbeat of geography, and it has informed several regional/economic development theories such as growth pole, central place theory and cumulative circular causative (CCC) theory. To understand the spatial dimension of reaching SDGs in Africa, we adopted the CCC theory for this study. CCC theory was propounded by Gunnar Myrdal in 1957, and it addresses the impacts or effects that systems or interventions may have on themselves and/or others. CCC theory explains that minimum disturbances or events can have direct effects on other events or parts of the system (Adams, 2011 ). Hence an effect becomes a causative factor for future effects, influencing itself and others in a manner particularly subtle, variable, flexible, and of an endless number of possibilities (Korzybski, 1994 ). Dawkins (2003)  summarises the theory as growth feeding on itself through cumulation causation. Myrdal, through CCC theory examined developmental disparities between developed and less developed countries using the concepts of “backwash effects”- divergent, “spread effects”- convergent, “institutional factors” and “political intervention”. Myrdal explains that increasing or decreasing return can lead to clustering of activities, hence countries with similar outcomes are likely to converge while the opposite will be true, reaffirming Tobler’s (1970)  law of geography. With CCC theory, there are feedbacks that reinforce relationships as either “virtuous circles” (favourable outcomes) or “vicious circle” (detrimental outcomes). Per virtuous and vicious cycle, growth and development can be influenced through a design principle focusing on requisite parsimony (targeting limited goals), requisite saliency (focus on most important goal), minimum critical specification (positive-identify essential issues and negative-no more specification to prevent high expectation) and power laws (special relations between events) (Binns, 2014 ). Policy mixing can ensure a high development and growth, but when goals are too many, as in the case of the SDGs, it leads to policy muddiness as requisite parsimony and requisite saliency become a challenge (Kharas and McArthur, 2019 ). This study favoured the use of CCC theory based on cumulativeness of development as opposed to location and growth pole theories, concepts of centrality and poles of development and concept of raw materials. For instance, Weber’s location theory argues that developed regions with industries take raw material from underdeveloped regions for growth (Brimberg, 1995 ). However, in the case of Africa, its growth poles are Asia, Europe, and America; countries that take a greater part of its raw materials while tackling down funds, innovation, and cooperation (Mills, 2018 ). Inadequate infrastructural development to link rural-urban and country-country works negatively against integration to support the growth pole theory, while political and border challenges worsen its impact (Chaponda and Lishman, 2017 ). Also, Free Economic Zones instituted to be poles of growth within and among African countries have been unsuccessful (Quaicoe et al., 2017 ). Following from the CCC theory, this study contributes to the call for spatial approach to SDGs studies in Africa through the use of spatial statistics by proposing the following hypothesis:• H1: African countries with low SDGs scores in 2016 were more likely to achieve higher SDGs scores in 2020  • H2: Countries with low scores of SDGs tends to cluster spatially  • H3: Synergies and trade-offs between SDGs experienced by a country are not the same for other countries  • H4: The level of influence between SDGs for each country changes with time    Unearthing spatial patterns and associations specific to countries allow for targeted policy recommendations which are more helpful in tracking the progress of countries in reaching SDGs across regional levels. In addition, identifying countries that share similarities in SDGs could help improve commitment, cooperation, and partnership for meeting the targets. Lastly, insights from the study could provide vital information to aid in policy design on trade-offs and synergies with spatial impacts in deciding on proper implementation strategies to reduce lock-in effects for unsustainable outcomes.   2 Materials and methods The study adopted a spatial analytical approach to assess the hypothesis set. Spatial statistics helps in mapping mean centre, directional trend of phenomenon, patterns of clustering or dispersion [spatial autocorrelation], identify statistically significant hotspots/coldspots [spatial clustering], estimate values over spaces [interpolation], build relationships [exploratory & geographic weighted regression] and predict [spatial machine learning] (Schiappapietra and Douglas, 2020 ; Heresi and Miranda, 2019  ). The superiority of spatial analysis over classical data analysis and the UN spatial dashboard (https://countries.africasdgindex.org ) is that it enhances understanding and explains patterns of phenomena using mathematical and geometric approaches with the theoretical understanding that near entities/countries are more in space, distance, and time. It helps in unearthing patterns for intervention and understanding country specific factors to inform tailored solutions (Li et al., 2020 ). 2.1 Data sources and processing SDGs scores for 2016 and 2020 were secured from the United Nations sustainable development database compiled by Sachs et al. (2016, 2020) . The UN SDG dataset was chosen because of its comprehensive nature, which covers more than 80% of the world’s countries, and the year periods were chosen because of their availability at the commencement of this study. Furthermore, the data’s robustness influenced its decisions, as it was compiled from over 63 sources, including the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and subjected to the following data quality criteria: data relevance, applicability, adequacy, timeliness, quality, and coverage. The SDGs index was created using normalcy testing, rescaling for comparability, aggregating data into SDGs scores, and sensitivity analysis (Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017 ). For rescaling, lower, and higher bounds of each item were transformed to 0-100 based on the following equation (Eq. (1) ):(1) X ′  = x − min ( x )   max ( x )  − min ( x )        where: X ' as the item. Items were aggregated through the fixed weighting methods first at individual SDG and secondly for a global SDG index by using the standard constant-elasticity-of-substitution function. The main aggregation function at individual SDG and country was calculated as follows (Eq. (2) ):(2) I i j   ( N i j   , N i j k   , p  )  = [ ∑ k = 1  N i j    1 N i j    I − p    i j k     ]  − 1 p        where:Iijk   score of k  item for j  SDG for country i   Nij   number of item  p  as permissible substitutability across items ranging from -1 ≤ r  ≤ ∞.    In cases where items of SDG were weak the Eq. (3)  was replaced by Eq. (4)  when the substitution was strong and Eq. (5)  for intermediate substitution (Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017 ).(3) I i j   ( N i j   , I i j k    )  = ∑ k = 1  N i j    1 N i j    I i j k        (4) I ij  ( I ijk  )  = Min  { I ijk  }      (5) I i j   ( N i j   , I i j k    )  = ∏ k = 1  N i j    N i j   I i j k          The function for the overall SDG index for a country was as follows (Eq. (6) )(6) I i j   ( N j  N i j   , N i j k    )  = ∑ k = 1  N i   1 N i   ∑ k = 1  N i j    1 N i j    I i j k          However, the data had a few limitations as some countries lacked records (Appendix A and B) and others had outdated records (Fritz et al., 2019 ). The missing data challenge was solved through spatial auto-filling after spatially joining SDG scores and their respective country geometric shape in ARCPRO software. Specific spatial autofill method was K -nearest-neighbour (KNN) function. The mean value of K  (the number of nearest neighbours) is used to calculate K -nearest-neighbour. The value of K  in this study was four, hence four neighbouring nations were used to estimate the value of countries with no value. Tobler’s first law of geography is the theoretical foundation of KNN, thus nearer things are more related in space and time, hence entities close to one another are likely to share similar values. A key limitation of KNN is the arbitrariness of the value of K  (Kenyhercz and Passalacqua, 2016 ). This notwithstanding, KNN was adopted because of its reliability, ease of computation, simplicity, speed of computation and scalability (Boukenze et al., 2016 ).  2.2 Data analysis The spatial analysis techniques adopted for this study were mean centre and trend analysis, bivariate analysis, incremental autocorrelation, Anselin Moran’s I  and random forest-based regression. Mean centre analysis was used to find the average x -y  coordinates of the SDG scores of countries to compare distribution of various SDG scores. The function for the mean centre is given as (Eq. (7) )(7) X ¯  = ∑ i = 1  n  x i   n   and  Y ¯  = ∑ i = 1  n  y i   n      where:xi   and yi   as the coordinates for the features i  and n  as the number of features (thus African countries).    The trend of SDG scores was assessed using the standard deviational ellipse to identify if the distribution was elongated and has a specific orientation. Standard deviational ellipse has the following function (Eq. (8) )(8) C = ( ∑ i = 1  n  x i   ¯   2  ∑ i = 1  n  x i   ¯  y i   ¯     ∑ i = 1  n  x i   ¯  y i   ¯   ∑ i = 1  n  y i   ¯   2     )      where:x  and y  as coordinates of the features (i )  {x −   andy −   } as the mean centre for the total features    The study adopted the one standard deviation adjustment factor. Assessing spatial clusters was based on the Anselin Local Moran’s I  to map clusters of countries with high/low scores. Anselin Local Moran’s I  is as follows (Eqs.(9) and (10) )(9) I i  = x i  − X −   S i 2   ∑ j − 1 , j ≠ i  n  w i , j   ( x j  − X −  )      where:xi   equates attribute of feature i   X −   mean of corresponding attributes  wij   the spatial weight of i  and j (10) S 2   i  = ∑ j = 1 , j ≠ i  n  ( x j  − X ¯   )   2   n − 1          where:n  is the total features    To reduce random clusters and outliers, the false discovery rate (FDR) was applied to all the Anselin Local Moran’s I  analyses to ensure only clusters or outliers with a 95% confidence level were retained. Specific modelling spatial relation techniques to ascertain causal effects of SDGs were the Local bivariate analysis and Leo Braiman Random forest-based regression. Entropy is the basis for analysing the relationship between two variables in spatial bivariate analysis. Calculations based on entropy look for relationships beyond linear to structural relationships such as exponential, quadratic, sinusoidal and complex. Leo Braiman Random forest-based regression is based on automated decision tree sets generated independently. Strobl et al. (2009)  give the function of Leo Braiman Random forest-based regression as follows (Eq. (11) )(11) { h ( x , θ k  )  , t = 1 , 2 , 3 , . . . , N }     where:θ k    is an independent distributed random variable  x  is an input variable  N  is the number of decision trees by using K  regression of h ( x , θ k  )   as the predictive results.      3 Results 3.1 Country SDGs scores in 2016 and 2020 To get a general overview of the progress of African countries towards a sustainable continent, the study compared scores of SDG for 2016 and 2020. Four permutations were generated, including Low (2016)-Low (2020), Low (2016)-High (2020), High (2016)-Low (2020) and High (2016)-High (2020). Ten countries had high values for SDG 1 in 2016 but had low scores in 2020, while about thirteen countries had an increase in scores, with the remaining being the same (Fig. 1  ). The SDGs with the least performing scores for 2020 (Low) compared with 2016 (High) were SDG 13 with 15 countries, followed by SDGs 15 and 17 with 14 countries each. SDG 9 had the least countries with five countries experiencing reduction in scores from 2016 (High) to 2020 (Low). In terms of SDGs with an increase in performing countries, SDGs 5, 6, 8 and 14 had fourteen countries each, with scores from Low in 2016 to High in 2020. SDGs 2 and 9 had the lowest countries with an increase in scores, with nine countries each from low to high. In general, the global index had about eleven countries with scores from Low in 2016 to High in 2020. Centre feature analysis generated diverse central points for individual SDGs for 2016 and 2020 for the five regional blocks in Africa (Fig. 2  ). Central features for SDGs 3, 6, 9 and 12 in 2016 were similar for 2020. The remaining SDGs had minor shifts, but the countries with the central feature remained the same except SDGs 1 and 7 which had central point for eastern Africa. The results also showed a directional trend in the performance of individual SDGs and year under review. All the SDGs for northern Africa for 2016 and 2020 had a diagonal movement to the northeast except SDG 2, which had a horizontal direction to the east and west (Fig. 2 ). Southern, west and central Africa kept the same direction for SDGs for 2016 and 2020. East Africa exhibited a different direction for all the SDGs for 2016 and 2020. In this regard, the directional trends for eastern Africa for 2016 was mostly to the northeast, while for 2020 they were to the southwest. Also, the ellipse of SDGs for 2016 had smaller sizes encompassing a few countries but became larger in 2020. In northern Africa deviational ellipse for SDGs 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, and 17 had larger sizes compared to those of 2020. However, deviational ellipse sizes for the west and central Africa were almost similar.  3.2 Spatial cluster of countries based on SDGs scores For 2016, Local Moran’s I  helped to unearth countries underperforming with statistical scores surrounded by other low score countries (Fig. 3  ). For SDG 1, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, and Tanzania were in the Low-Low cluster. SDG 2, Democratic Republic of Congo, Chad, Eretria, Ethiopia, and Sudan were also observed to be statistically Low-Low countries. SDG 3 had Central African countries and Madagascar as Low-Low clusters. SDG 4 had Eastern African countries as Low-Low clusters whereas SDG 5 Low-Low and Low-High were limited to western African countries and southern Africa, respectively. SDGs 6, 7 and 8 had only one country each, with Low-Low zones such as Chad, Guinea, and Ethiopia. Countries with statistically low SDGs values surrounded by high values (outliers) were Angola for SDG 4, Tanzania and South Africa for SDG 5, Mauritania, and Benin (SDG 8), Lesotho (SDG 9), Cote D’ Ivoire (SDG 10), Zimbabwe (SDG 11), Burkina Faso (SDG 13) and Liberia (SDG 15) (Fig. 3 ). The Global Index had High-High and High-Low clusters for Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Ghana, Togo and Eswatini, while Low-Low clusters were Burkina Faso and Niger. In 2020, most of the Low-Low clusters changed to Low-High clusters, while the number of countries with High-High and High-Low clusters reduced (Fig. 4  ). SDG 1 had Mozambique and Chad as Low-High and Low-Low respectively, with Malawi and Zambia as Low-High clusters. For SDG 2, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali, and Senegal, Guinea, and Zambia experienced Low-Low clusters while Eswatini and Uganda showed the same cluster type for SDG 5. Western Sahara had a Low-Low category for SDG 6, Chad and Eswatini had a Low-Low category for SDGs 9 and 10, respectively. SDGs 10, 11, 12 and 13 had three countries each in High-High and High-Low clusters. The global index had no High-High and High-Low categories. Rather, there were some Low-High and Low-Low categories for Guinea and the Central Africa Republic, respectively (Fig. 4 ).  3.3 Synergies and trade-offs between SDGs Spatial bivariate analysis showed relationships between SDGs in relation to countries. Four types of relationships were proven between SDGs for 2016, but in 2020, five different relationships were unearthed (Figs. 5  , 6  ). In 2016, most Western African countries such as Burkina Faso, Cote D’ Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone exhibited a positive relationship between SDGs 1 and 4, while Cameroon, Malawi, Madagascar, Ethiopia, and Niger had a convex relationship. Non-uninformative and different types of relationships for the same SDGs across countries were exhibited for SDGs 1 and 9, 1 and 16, 4 and 6, 4 and 9, 4 and 10, 6 and 10, 7 and 11, and 10 and 16 (Appendix A). The remaining SDG pairs had single relationships but were spatially defined by specific countries. Some of the relationships were more than linear with other undefined and complex for SDGs 2 and 16, 2 and 17, 4 and 16, 7 and 11, and 10 and 16. Results showed that SDG 4 had three distinct types of relationships with SDGs 6, 7 and 11, and 10 (Fig. 5 ; Appendix A). Spatial relationships for 2020 SDG scores showed that relationships between SDGs are not permanent but change with time. Spatial relationships for SDG 1 and other SDGs for 2020 increased from 6 to 7 with a break in relationships with SDGs 5, 12 and 17, and new relationships with SDGs 3, 6, 7 and 13 were established (Figs. 5 , 6 ; Appendix B). SDG 1 showed relationships with SDGs 4, 6, 7 and 9 which encompassed all countries in Africa. While the relationships for SDG 2 with SDGs 16 and 17 in 2016 were broken in 2020, a new relationship was established for SDGs 2 and 13. SDG 3 had three new relationships with SDGs 6, 9 and 11 in 2020, with positive linear and convex relationships (Fig. 6 ; Appendix B). SDG 4 saw five new relationships with SDGs 6, 9, 11, 13 and 16, while at the same time keeping relationships with SDGs 4 and 7 from 2016. SDGs 5 and 7 kept their relationship but a change in the type of relationship from positive linear to undefined complex, with only Kenya having a positive linear relationship in 2020. Finally, SDG 6 had no relationship with SDG 10 in 2020 as it was in 2016, but set up relationships with SDGs 7, 9, 13 and 16 (Fig. 6 ; Appendix B). SDG 7 had relationships with SDGs 11 and 12 in 2016 (Fig. 5 ) but could not keep the relationships in 2020. However, new relationships were established with SDGs 1, 3, 9, 13 and 16. SDG 8 set up a spatial relationship for the first time with SDG 9 (Fig. 6 ; Appendix B). SDG 9 also saw broken relationshipswith SDGs 10 and 12, but new relationships with SDGs 3, 6, 7, 8 and 13. The relationship between SDGs 11 and 7, which was undefined and negative, showed a positive relationship with SDG 4, negative and undefined with SDG 12, negative and concave with SDG 13, and concave and positive with SDG 17 (Fig. 6 ; Appendix B).  3.4 Level of influence between SDGs Results per forest-based regression showed various levels of importance/influence of inter SDGs relationships. Forest-based regression generated training R 2  with the least value of 0.76 with a p -value of 0.00. The validation R 2  was in the range of 0.04 and 0.73, with SDGs 6, 11, 16 and 17 not being significant with a p -value above 0.05. In 2016, the dominant SDGs influencing SDG 1 were SDGs 9 (32%) and 4 (25%), with the least being SDGs 5 (9%) and 17 (9%) (Table 1  ). SDG 4 relationships with SDGs 1, 3, 6, 7, 9 and 10 had a high training prediction (R 2 = 0.91 and p =0.00), and validation (R 2 =0.53, p =0.00). SDG 4 had the most influence from SDGs 3 (21%) and 7 (21%) and had the least influence as SDG 10 (10%). SDG 7 had strong influence from SDGs 5 (25%), 12 (24%) and 3 (22%), with good training prediction (R 2 =0.92, p =0.00) and validation (R 2 =0.73, p =0.00). SDG 11 had 100% influence from SDG 7, while SDGs 2, 3, 5, 6 and 17 had two SDGs influencing them in shared ranges of 45% to 55%. The level of importance or influence of SDG on one other witnessed a significant change in 2020 (Table 2  ). R 2  for training data was within the range of 0.75 to 0.95 with a p -value 0.00, while validation R 2  for SDGs 2, 5, 8, 10 were within the range of 0.03 to 0.18, and not significant with a p -value above 0.05. Beyond the diagnostics results, the study identified a change in influence on SDG 1, shifting from SDG 9 (22%) to SDG 6 (23%) but with a small margin. SDG 16 (33%) had the highest influence on SDG 3 in 2020 but SDGs 4 and 17 influences on SDG 3 reduced from 55% and 45% respectively to 16% and 14% from 2016 to 2020 (Table 2) . SDG 4 had SDGs 13 (26%) and 11 (19%) being the main influencers in 2020 (Table 2 ) as opposed to SDGs 7 and 6 in 2016. SDG 4 kept its dominance over SDG 6 in both 2016 and 2020 with influence of 58% and 22%, respectively. For SDG 7, there was a close level of influence between SDGs 1, 4 and 5 with 15% influence, SDGs 3 and 9 with 11% influence each in 2020, but in 2016, SDGs 5 and 11 were the only two SDGs with the same level of influence of 14% each. SDG 13 had SDG 12 having level of 24% on it with influence from SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10 and 11 which never existed in 2016. SDG 1, the most dominant influence on SDG 16 with an influence of 39%, had only 4% influence in 2020 with SDG 3 (28%) as the main influencer. SDG 17 had SDG 1 as the leading influencer in both 2016 and 2020.   4 Discussion 4.1 Country SDGs scores in 2016 and 2020 The challenges affecting Africa in its quest to attain the SDGs are diverse and complex. Data-driven interventions to address the challenges have achieved little success largely because of the non-spatial approach often adopted, which provides less recognition for individuality and uniqueness of each country and interrelationship among them. This study sought to fill the spatial gap in understanding the progress made by African countries in achieving the United Nations’ SDGs using two data points, 2016 and 2020 and through spatial pattern distributions, clustering, and relationships. The essence of the research was to provide spatial highlights of location/place specific issues/problems with statistically significant levels as useful information for policymakers and planners in the strategic allocation of scarce resources. Hypothesis H1 (African countries with low SDGs scores in 2016 were more likely to achieve higher SDGs scores in 2020 ) confirmed by the results as a general spatial overview of the SDGs scores showed that African countries added onto gains in 2016, confirming Myrdal’s CCT. Findings revealed that Dawkins (2003)  notion that growth feeds on itself cumulatively holds for Africa as more countries with low SDGs gained high scores in 2020. Adams (2011)  contends that effects seen are mainly because of the introduction of disturbances or events (policies) to direct the cause of development for the future. Other countries, on the other hand, had lower scores in 2020 than in 2016, which can be attributed to the negative socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 pushed over 60 million Africans into poverty and food insecurity, 110 million children out of school, threatened 20 million jobs, and cut development remittances by 23.1% (Awode et al., 2021 ; Munyati, 2020 ; The Sustainable Development Goals Center for Africa and Sustainable Development Solutions Network, 2020 ). Conflicts, climate change disasters, corruption, and international market effects all worked to keep SDGs scores from rising in 2020 (Xu et al., 2021 ; Le, 2021 ; Chirambo, 2018 ).  4.2 Spatial cluster of countries based on SDGs scores The identification of clusters presents a better opportunity for targeted interventions to stimulate collective development and ensure sustainability by 2030. Spatial clustering among African countries clearly confirms Tobler’s first law of geography that near things are more related than things that are far apart. It also reaffirms Myrdal’s idea of increasing or decreasing returns with High-High clusters as increasing returns zones while Low-Low clusters as decreasing return zones. The identification of Low-Low clusters affirms H2 (Countries with low scores of SDGs tend to cluster spatially ).  To improve developmental disparities between Low-Low and High-High clusters, targeted policies are needed within Low-Low clusters to change future downwards cumulative effects in development. This is to prevent the reinforcement of negative SDGs outcomes into an everlasting vicious cycle. On the other hand, High-Low clusters present an opportunity for hope for development because of the possibility of the spread effect from countries with high SDGs to countries with low SDG scores. To keep the virtuous circle enjoyed by performing countries in High-High clusters and High-Low clusters, it is important to promote institutional and political interventions to prevent derails in the future, as recommended by Myrdal. Consequentially, institutional and political interventions are more needed in High-Low clusters as low cluster countries like Sudan, Niger, and the Central Africa Republic that are facing effects of climate change, insurgency, and political instability, can produce negative effects into high performing countries. Low-Low and Low-High cluster countries, especially for SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 14 and 15, need much more design principles that meets Binns (2014)  themes of requisite parsimony (targeting limited goals), requisite saliency (focus on most important goal), minimum critical specification (positive-identify essential issues and negative-no more specification to prevent high expectation) and power laws (special relations between events). As Kharas and McArthur (2019)  indicated, the goals are too many, and this will be problematic for Low-Low and Low-High clusters to achieve sustainability by 2030. Hence, targeting salient SDGs will produce maximum effects and ensure cumulative effects in other SDGs. To prevent policy muddiness for Low-Low cluster countries, understanding the spatial interactional effects of SDGs on each other is essential for proper policy mixing and achieving minimum critical specification (positive-identify essential issues and negative-no more specification to prevent high expectations).  4.3 Synergies, trade-offs and level of influence between SDGs On the front of the spatial relationships between SDGs, the study found that synergies and trade-offs were not always linear and uniform across countries as the study accepts H3 (Synergies and trade-offs between SDGs experienced by a country are not the same for other countries ) (Baffoe et al., 2020 ; Lusseau and Mancini, 2019 ; Gilla et al., 2019 ; Mantlana and Maoela, 2019 ; Cling et al., 2018 ). Per the results, synergies and trade-offs can range from linear to concave, convex and undefined complex. Previous studies which treated relationships as linear and uniform might be the reason for the implementation of generic developmental interventions, which mostly do not work for most African countries (Golding et al., 2017 ). However, the study found some similarities in terms of relationships with other non-spatial works. Specifically, the study found relationships between SDG 6 with SDGs 1 and 3, as identified by Gilla et al. (2019) . Analysis by Mantlana and Maoela (2019) , which found co-benefits between/for SDGs 6 and 9, and SDGs 7 and 9, was also spatially confirmed in this study. Also, Mantlana and Maoela’s (2019)  finding that SDGs 7, 3 and 6 share co-benefits is spatially true in this study. Spatially, SDGs 7 and 16 had strong positive relationship. Furthermore, Mantlana and Maoela’s (2019)  trade-off interlinkage between SDGs 9 and 13 was confirmed in this study, but this time, a concave rather than a linear relationship was established. According to Jaiyesimi (2016) , when well executed, SDG 1 will have direct effect on all SDGs. This study’s finding proved otherwise since SDG 1 could not have the so-called effect on SDGs 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 16, as shown in the preceding section. On the larger scale, the greatest challenges impeding SDG implementation in Africa are financial, supporting peace, measuring progress and accountability (Kumar et al., 2016 ). In this study, Kumar et al.’s (2016)  assertion was evident in the positive relationship found among SDGs 1, 4, and 9. However, SDGs 16 and 2 relationships were highly undefined and complex for Nigeria, Ghana, and Liberia. This undefined relationship means that there are other factors beyond SDG 16 which have greater effect on SDG 2 in these countries. Mugagga and Nabaasa (2016)  claimed that SDG 17 (Partnership to achieve the SDGs) was fundamental for African countries since their problems are similar and transboundary. Spatially, SDGs 17 and 1 were intertwined but only confined to Southern African countries. Contrary to other works, the study found no spatially positive relationship between SDGs 5 (Gender equality) and 6 (Clean water and sanitation) as claimed by Mugagga and Nabaasa (2016) . The study did not establish SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth) as the outcome of SDG 16 (Peace, justice and strong institution), as postulated by Cling et al. (2018) . Co-benefits were not spatially established between SDGs 7 and 13, and between SDGs 11 and 13 as argued by Mantlana and Maoela (2019) . Rather the study found a concave relationship between SDGs 7 and 13 indicating that as SDG 7 is attained, SDG 13 reduces but hollows inward. Baffoe et al. (2020)  found a negative relationship between SDGs 7 and 13 but only as a linear path. Also, no relationship was found between SDGs 7 and 10 as claimed by Mantlana and Maoela (2019)  and Jaiyesimi (2016) . The fear of Nilsson et al. (2016)  that poorly executed SDG 9 will produce trade-offs with SDGs 14 and 15 was also not proven spatially. Jaiyesimi (2016)  asserted that bad implementation of SDG 1 targets can lead to the downfall of all SDGs in Africa. In this study, it appears either SDG 1 implemented in a planned or unplanned manner resulted in a concave relationship with SDG 13 (Climate action). SDG 17 (Partnership for achievement of SDGs) was in a concave relationship with SDG 12 (Responsible consumption and production), and SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and communities) for most countries. Furthermore, the study established new relationships between SDGs 6 and 4, 7, 9, 13, and 16. Alvarez et al. (2009)  found a meaningful relationship between SDG 3 (Good health and well-being) and SDG 4 (Quality education) which was also spatially confirmed. Beyond the synergies and trade-offs documented in the literature, the study found affordable SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) to be spatially complex and undefined. Some countries exhibited a direct negative relationship between SDGs 11 and 12 while concurrently others had undefined complex relationships. SDG 11 and SDG 13 were totally at variance across all countries except Cote D’ Ivoire and Guinea. SDGs 13, 7 and 9 showed the greatest relationship with other SDGs such as 10 and 8. This suggests that it is important that more attention is dedicated to these SDGs 13, 7 and 9, if maximum co-benefits are to be achieved in the attainment of SDGs in 2024. SDG 7 will provide the needed energy needs of African countries in achieving SDGs 1, 3, 4, 5, and 16 while stimulating SDG 9 which will influence SDGs 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 5, and 16, leading to more climate action (SDG 13). The relationships between SDGs and their changing nature from 2016 to 2020 per country make H4 (The level of influence between SDGs for each country changes with time ) valid while confirming the CCC as a different goal have a spread, and/or backward effects. Moreover, the attainment of a sustainable continent is dependent on holding on to current progress and adding up. Irrespective of the gains, not all countries will be sustainable by 2030, while those likely to achieve sustainability will still be lacking in one or more specific SDGs.  4.4 Limitations of the study This study’s drawback is related to the usage of UN SDGs scores between 2016 and 2020. The fundamental flaw with SDGs data is the lack of clear definition and operationalization of the goals (Paoli and Addeo, 2019 ). The SDGs scores are also said to be devoid of purpose and high-quality indicators, not being produced using a sound methodology, provided on a regular basis, comparable across time, and publicly available (Mugellini et al., 2021 ). Moreover, the SDGs scores are not legally enforceable on governments for comparative analysis (Janoušková et al., 2018 ). However, generating complete and all-encompassing data that is widely accepted by all governments and researchers will take years (Sachs et al., 2018 ). While obtaining correct data, the trustworthiness of data, timeliness, and completeness from closed economies and developing countries will also be significantly difficult. Current SDGs data saves time and effort in accumulating such developmental data by providing a more accurate baseline for regional and global follow-up assessments（Janoušková et al., 2018） . It is particularly useful for a general and quick assessment of the progress of countries. To resolve the data gap problems, researchers can approximate scores for countries using spatial interpolation, fill, and machine learning algorithms and the approach adopted by this work which are statistically sound and acceptable.   5 Conclusions The spatial approach to understanding the problem of Africa on the path to a sustainable continent is important because of the uniqueness, diversity, and similarity among countries in terms of social, cultural, economic, and environmental conditions. Although spatial statistics can unearth these complex relationships between African countries and SDGs, less attention is devoted to this approach at the continental level and holistically looking at all the SDGs concurrently. Reflecting on this empirical gap, we looked to provide detailed perspectives to help understand the trajectory of African countries to a sustainable continent by identifying spatial patterns of SDGs, hotspots-coldspots and building spatial synergies and trade-offs for target-based interventions. The study identified a temporal dimension and a changing nature of spatial distributions of various achievements of SDGs. With a local clustering approach, the study unearths countries underperforming neighbour countries which can serve as justification for tailor-made interventions. Also, countries underperforming their neighbours can be stimulated by international interventions of technical support and funds while they enjoy fertilisation and diffusion of policies from high performing countries. On the issue of spatial relationships between SDGs, the study unearthed three different relationships (concave, convex and undefined) in addition to the linearly positive and negative relationships from most non-spatial studies. Also, relationships were not uniform as significant levels differed across countries as different countries had a different relationship with respect to the same pairs of SDGs. The study concludes that the complexity of African countries in reaching SDGs was clearly elucidated with findings previously unknown. In addition, the spatial approach presents a unique opportunity to identify specific countries which needs specific interventions based on their performance and neighbourhoods for greater diffusion and cooperative growth. The significant and mutual reinforcing interrelationships observed among some of the SDGs call for the bundling of policies, interventions and activities by governments, NGOs, donor agencies and impact investors to yield complementary benefits. Also, it is essential to have vertical and horizontal institutional coordination between sectoral entities and different actors of development to help optimise synergies and minimise conflicts in resource allocation and efforts.
