                  Understanding the interactions among Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is critical for prioritizing SDGs and accelerating the overall SDGs progress. However, SDG interactions and prioritizations at the regional scale have rarely been researched (e.g., Asia), and more importantly, their spatial differences and temporal variations remain elusive. Here, we focused on the Asian Water Tower region (16 countries), which represents major challenges for Asian and even global SDG progress, and we assessed the spatiotemporal variations in SDG interactions and prioritizations in the region from 2000 to 2020 based on correlation coefficients calculations and network analyses. We observed a striking spatial difference in the SDG interactions, which may be minimized by promoting balanced progress toward SDGs 1 (no poverty), 5 (gender equality), and 11 (sustainable cities and communities) across countries. The prioritization differences of the same SDG across countries ranged from 8 to 16 places. Temporally, the SDG trade-offs in the region have declined, implying a possible shift to synergies. However, such success has faced several obstacles, mainly climate change and a lack of partnerships. The prioritizations of SDGs 1 and 12 (responsible consumption and production) have shown the largest increase and decrease, respectively, over time. Overall, to accelerate the regional SDG progress, we highlight the importance of enhancing top prioritized SDGs 3 (good health and well-being), 4 (quality education), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 11, and 13 (climate actions). Related complex actions are also provided (e.g., across-scaled cooperation, interdisciplinary research, and sectoral transformation).

However, SDG interactions and prioritizations at the regional scale have rarely been researched (e.g., Asia), and more importantly, their spatial differences and temporal variations remain elusive. Here, we focused on the Asian Water Tower region (16 countries), which represents major challenges for Asian and even global SDG progress, and we assessed the spatiotemporal variations in SDG interactions and prioritizations in the region from 2000 to 2020 based on correlation coefficients calculations and network analyses. We observed a striking spatial difference in the SDG interactions, which may be minimized by promoting balanced progress toward SDGs 1 (no poverty), 5 (gender equality), and 11 (sustainable cities and communities) across countries. The prioritization differences of the same SDG across countries ranged from 8 to 16 places. Temporally, the SDG trade-offs in the region have declined, implying a possible shift to synergies. However, such success has faced several obstacles, mainly climate change and a lack of partnerships. The prioritizations of SDGs 1 and 12 (responsible consumption and production) have shown the largest increase and decrease, respectively, over time. Overall, to accelerate the regional SDG progress, we highlight the importance of enhancing top prioritized SDGs 3 (good health and well-being), 4 (quality education), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 11, and 13 (climate actions). Related complex actions are also provided (e.g., across-scaled cooperation, interdisciplinary research, and sectoral transformation).

A synergy implies that reinforcing one SDG can benefit progress in another, while a trade-off indicates that progress in one SDG can hinder progress in another (Zhang et al., 2022 ). Harnessing these interactions (i.e., minimizing trade-offs and maximizing synergies) is critical to help achieve as many SDGs as possible (i.e., the best overall achievements) by 2030 in the fastest way possible (Pham-Truffert et al., 2020 ; Warchold et al., 2020 ). More importantly, according to the different impacts of each SDG in such interactions, SDG prioritizations can be identified (i.e., the larger the impacts are, the higher the prioritizations) (Huan et al., 2022 ), which can provide evidence-based support for ensuring the implementation and effectiveness of SDG-related actions (Allen et al., 2019a ; Zhang et al., 2022 ). Many related studies using systems thinking based on expert elicitation, text mining, pairwise correlations among SDG indicators, and causality analysis have emerged since 2016 (e.g., Nilsson et al., 2016 ; Griggs et al., 2017 ; Pradhan et al., 2017 ; Sebestyén et al., 2019 ; Pham-Truffert et al., 2020 ). Particularly, network analysis, a holistic approach that provides clear visualization and conceptualization of interactions among variables and well-developed notions to map these interactions, has been widely adopted (Swain and Ranganathan, 2021 ; Wu et al., 2022 ). Multiple network centrality metrics (e.g., degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality) can be used to assess the importance (prioritization) of SDGs in the interaction network (e.g., Lusseau and Mancini, 2019 ; McGowan et al., 2019 ; Breu et al., 2021 ; Singh et al., 2021 ; Huan and Zhu, 2022 ). Nevertheless, previous studies have mostly been global- and national-scale analyses and have focused on simplified or localized indicators (Zhang et al., 2022 ), reflecting a knowledge gap in regional-scale (e.g., Asian scale) SDG interactions and prioritizations. Although Asia has made progress on several SDGs during the last two decades, it is still not on track to achieve any SDGs by 2030 (Sachs et al., 2022 ). In particular, the Asian Water Tower (AWT) region, composed of 16 countries located in and around the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau, has become a major priority and challenge for Asia in its pursuit to achieve SDGs. Often referred to as the “AWT”, the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is the world's highest plateau and the source of multiple rivers and glaciers (Yao, 2018 ). It contains many critical transboundary river basins where at least 1.9 billion people reside, and approximately 3.4 billion people rely on the food produced in these basins (World Bank, 2021 ). The 16 countries located in and around the AWT have close linkages; for example, the ecosystem services provided by the AWT in terms of agricultural diversity, water, and nutrients for vast arable lands in river basins are crucial for regional livelihoods, energy and social security, and economic development (Kandel et al., 2021 ). Thus, by using the AWT as the center, we identified the region consisting of 16 countries1  1 The 16 countries are Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Thailand, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.   covered by the major river basins the AWT involves as the AWT region (Fig. S1), where SDG progress has fallen behind expectations, which can significantly influence Asian progress. However, research regarding actions for SDG progress in the region is rare. Addressing the uneven progress of the SDGs at the national scale in the AWT region or even in Asia is still a significant challenge (Sachs et al., 2022 ). Identifying regional SDG interactions and prioritizations can promote policy coherence and balanced development across countries (Reyers and Selig, 2020 ). However, existing research has focused on SDG interactions and prioritizations in the AWT itself or at the national scale (e.g., Wang et al., 2020 ; Xu et al., 2020 ; Zhang et al., 2022 ), overlooking spatial differences. Considering that countries have different strengths and dilemmas, analyzing such differences can support identifying synergistic actions to evenly promote SDGs at a subregional scale (Laumann et al., 2022 ). In addition, many global-scale studies are based on limited indicators due to data availability, which may reduce or reorient the content of SDGs even if those indicators have certain comprehensiveness and representativeness (Huan et al., 2021a ). Furthermore, national-scale studies generally do not fit well with the official United Nations SDG indicator framework due to their emphasis on localization. Thus, the global and national indicators may not be applicable at the regional scale (Huan et al., 2021a ), while the use of indicators suitable for the regional scale, which are based on national data availability, can be of further help in identifying SDG interactions and prioritizations. The linkages between countries are dynamic and vulnerable to various factors, such as resource availability, economic interests, and black swan events (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) (Kroll et al., 2019 ), which may cause SDG interactions and prioritizations at the regional scale to change over time. However, no studies have measured the evolution of SDG interactions and prioritizations over time in the AWT region or Asia. Continuous monitoring of such information is crucial for providing evidence-based support to adjust macro actions (Zhang et al., 2022 ). Meanwhile, according to SDG prioritizations, key drivers (i.e., top prioritized SDGs) of interaction changes can be revealed, which can help identify appropriate actions to advance the full achievement of SDGs at regional and national scales. To fill the above-highlighted research gaps, we mapped the spatial and temporal variability of SDG interactions (synergies and trade-offs) and of SDG prioritizations in the AWT region from 2000 to 2020. We aimed to address the following questions. First, what are the interactions among and prioritizations of SDGs in the AWT region? Second, what differences exist in the SDG interactions and SDG prioritizations across countries in the AWT region? Third, what are the time-varying characteristics of the SDG interactions and SDG prioritizations in the AWT region? To answer these questions, we constructed a composite methodological framework based on calculating correlation coefficients and network analyses. According to our results, we discuss how to promote development consistency across countries, the different dilemmas of countries with high SDG synergies and those with high SDG trade-offs, the transformation from trade-offs to synergies, the top prioritized SDGs for the AWT region and related actions, the keys to success at the national level, and the limitations and uncertainties of assessments. Overall, this study deepens the understanding of the sustainable development process and provides new insights into regional cooperation, national transformation, policy coherence, and action effectiveness for achieving as many SDGs as possible by 2030.  2 Methods The methodological framework was constructed in four steps. First, we constructed an indicator framework for the 17 SDGs, collected national data from 2000 to 2020, and interpolated the missing data. Second, we normalized the raw data to a score range of 0–1 and aggregated them into the SDG scores (0–1) by the arithmetic mean method. Third, the SDG scores for each country in each year were used for SDG interaction (synergies and trade-offs) analysis, that is, calculating the Spearman's correlation coefficients between the SDG scores. In addition to analyzing the SDG interactions in the overall AWT region over 21 years, we analyzed the SDG interactions in each country and in each year. Fourth, we constructed a network of the synergies and trade-offs among SDGs for the AWT region, calculated the weighted degree centrality (network impact) of each SDG in it, and prioritized SDGs according to their centralities (i.e., the higher centrality score of an SDG was, the higher its prioritization). Additionally, analyses were further performed from temporal and spatial perspectives. 2.1 Data preparation and processing To quantify the progress toward SDGs over time, 98 indicators (Table S1) applicable to the regional scale for 83 targets and the 17 SDGs were selected from several global and Asian influential indicator lists for SDG assessments (see sources in the Supplementary Information). We collected data for the period 2000 and 2020 from the 16 selected countries on the basis of this indicator framework. Data sources are shown in the Supplementary Information and data availability in Table S2. Overall, among the 16 countries, Kyrgyzstan had the best data availability (78.38 %), while Turkmenistan had the worst (71.96 %); of all 21 years, 2015 contained the best data availability (92.92 %), whereas 2020 had the worst (63.01 %) (Table S2a). Full time-series data can help capture SDG performance over time (Little and Rubin, 2002 ; Sachs et al., 2018 ). Thus, according to Huan et al., 2021b, 2022 ), a combination of several interpolation and prediction simulation approaches were further adopted to interpolate the missing data, such as, the Akima spline interpolation, cubic spline interpolation (De Boor, 1978 ), linear interpolation (Blu et al., 2004 ), and average value of existing time-series data. Interpolation examples are given in Table S3. Given the differences in measurements and unit dimensions for different indicators, the raw data were not comparable to each other (Huan et al., 2021a ). Thus, we normalized the data using a min-max-method (Eq. (1) ) (Hametner and Kostetckaia, 2020 ; Huan et al., 2021a ), which is a commonly used method for normalization in sustainability assessments. It requires first considering the attributes of the indicator changes, including positive (the larger the data are, the better for sustainable development), negative (the smaller the data are, the better for sustainable development), and intermediate (the smaller the difference is from an intermediate value, the better for sustainable development) ones (Zhang et al., 2022 ).(1) y ijk  = x ijk  − x i min   x i max  − x i min    , if the indicator  i  is positive    x i max  − x ijk   x i max  − x i min    , if the indicator  i  is negative   1 − x q  − x ijk   max x q  − x i min   x i max  − x q      , x ijk  < x q    1 − x ijk  − x q   max x q  − x i min   x i max  − x q      , x ijk  > x q    1 , x ij  = x q      , if the indicator  i  is intermediate         In Eq. (1) , y ijk   is the normalized data value of indicator i  for country j  in year k ; x ijk   is the data value of indicator i  for country j  in year k ; x i  min   and x i  max   are the minimum and maximum data values of indicator i  across all years for all countries, respectively; and x q   is the data value for the moderate indicator. In this study, indicator 27 (gender parity index of gross primary school enrollment) was an intermediate indicator, and its x q   of it was set to 1. Given that there is no unified standard for weighting (Huan et al., 2019 ), for simplicity, each target contained in an SDG was given equal weight, as was each indicator in a target, indicating that we assumed that each indicator had the same importance and was not influenced by subjectivity (Zhang et al., 2022 ). The arithmetic mean method was then adopted to aggregate the values of each indicator into the scores of the corresponding targets, which were further aggregated into the SDG scores every year for each country (Hametner and Kostetckaia, 2020 ). Each SDG score ranged from 0 to 1. Eventually, we used these SDG scores as proxies for mapping the interactions among SDGs.  2.2 Mapping the interactions among SDGs Many previous studies captured the interactions among SDGs in a statistical sense (e.g., Pradhan et al., 2017 ; Tremblay et al., 2020 ; Warchold et al., 2020 ; Wu et al., 2022 ; Huan et al., 2023 ). A commonly used method, Spearman's correlation coefficient is based on ranked values, insensitive to outliers, and able to measure nonlinear relations (Hauke and Kossowski, 2011 ; Huan et al., 2021a ). Thus, this study adopted Spearman's correlation coefficients to quantitatively assess the interactions between each possible combination of two SDGs in the AWT region over 21 years (2000–2020). Positive values represent synergies, whereas negative values represent trade-offs. To avoid overinterpretation of correlation (Hauke and Kossowski, 2011 ), only the significant values of coefficients (P  < 0.05) were considered. If the P -value of an interrelationship's coefficient is >5 %, the interrelationship is classified as uncertain. To further identify the spatial and temporal variation in SDG interactions, we 1. used SDG scores for each country to separately calculate the coefficients between SDGs for 16 countries and 2. calculated the coefficients between SDGs over the period 2000–2020 using yearly SDG scores for the AWT region.  2.3 Analyzing the impacts of SDGs in the network We then conducted network analysis (e.g., Weitz et al., 2018 ; Pham-Truffert et al., 2020 ; Wu et al., 2022 ) to better reveal the key SDGs that dominate SDG interactions and, more importantly, to identify a more effective order of prioritizations for accelerating SDGs (Huan and Zhu, 2022 ). Specifically, we constructed a network of the synergies and trade-offs in the AWT region over 21 years (2000–2020) to assess the centrality (i.e., network impact) of each SDG. In this network, the nodes were the 17 SDGs, and links between nodes represented synergies/trade-offs between two nodes and their weights (the interactions were not only present or absent but also of different intensities). We calculated the weighted degree centrality of each SDG (Eq. (2) ); that is, we calculated an SDG's centrality based on the relative importance of the numbers and weights of links of that SDG (Opsahl et al., 2010 ; Huan et al., 2022 ). For each interactive SDG pair, we used the absolute value of its Spearman's correlation coefficient as the weight (Wu et al., 2022 ).(2) C D w α   i  = ∑ j N  x ij  × ∑ j N  w ij   ∑ j N  x i j      α      In Eq. (2) , i  is the given SDG; j  is all other SDGs; N  is the total number of SDGs; x  is the adjacency matrix, in which the cell x ij   is defined as 1 if SDG i  is directly linked to SDG j , and 0 otherwise; w  is the weighted adjacency matrix, in which w ij   > 0 if SDG i  is directly linked to SDG j , and the value represents the weight of the interaction. C D  w α   (i ) is the weighted degree centrality of SDG i ; and α  is a positive tuning parameter that can be adjusted to reflect the relative importance of the numbers and weights of links of an SDG. The value of α  can be generally set as 0, 0.5, 1 or 1.5 (it can also be other values >0). Opsahl et al. (2010)  identified the impacts of different values of α  on the results. According to them and Huan et al., 2022 , we set the value of α  to 0.5. To further identify the spatial and temporal variation in the centralities (prioritizations) of the SDGs, we 1. constructed an SDG interaction network for each country to separately calculate the centrality of each SDG for the 16 countries; and 2. constructed an SDG interaction network for the AWT region in each year over the period 2000–2020 to calculate the yearly centralities of the SDGs.  2.4 Robustness tests To assess the effect of excluding nonsignificant values of coefficients (P  > 0.05) (i.e., nonsignificant synergies and trade-offs), we conducted network analyses for the network with the raw correlations among SDGs in the AWT region over 21 years (2000–2020). To analyze the interactions among SDGs, in addition to the Spearman's correlation coefficients, several studies have used Pearson correlation coefficients, which generally assess the linear relationship between two variables (Putra et al., 2020 ). We therefore tested their different impacts on the results of SDG interactions for the AWT region over 21 years (2000–2020). The detailed procedure of using Pearson's correlation coefficients is shown in the Supplementary Information.   3 Results 3.1 Interactions among SDGs Our results showed a larger share of synergies (58.09 %) than trade-offs (22.06 %) among SDGs for the AWT region over 21 years (2000–2020) (Fig. 1  ). Except for SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth), 12 (responsible consumption and production), and 13 (climate action), the synergies belonging to each SDG outweighed the trade-offs (Fig. 1 ). Among the17 SDGs, SDGs 3 (good health and well-being), 5 (gender equality), and 7 (affordable and clean energy) had the most synergies, and 13 had the most trade-offs (Fig. 1 ). We used SDG scores for each country to separately calculate the coefficients between SDGs for the 16 countries to understand the spatial differences in SDG interactions. Among the 16 countries in the AWT region, the largest shares of synergies among SDGs were observed in China (66.18 %), followed by India (64.71 %) and Laos (62.5 %), whereas Turkmenistan had the least (25 %) (Fig. 2 a ). Meanwhile, the most trade-offs among SDGs were found in Thailand (38.24 %), followed by Nepal (33.82 %) and Pakistan (31.62 %), and the least were in Uzbekistan (3.68 %) (Fig. 2 b). Overall, we could see that countries with high synergies (>50 %) among SDGs were mainly found in the central and southern parts of the AWT region, and high trade-offs (>25 %) among SDGs were mostly distributed in the central and southeast parts of the AWT region. Additionally, the synergies among SDGs in each country outweighed the trade-offs, with the largest difference in Uzbekistan (55.88 %) and the smallest in Turkmenistan (0.74 %) (Fig. 2 a and b). Notably, five countries (Bhutan, Bangladesh, Kyrgyzstan, Thailand, and Tajikistan) had one to two SDGs (e.g., SDG 12 [responsible consumption and production]) that showed no interactions with other SDGs (Figs. S2 to S17). Furthermore, SDGs 3 (good health and well-being) and 6 (clean water and sanitation) had the most synergies in most countries (approximately 4.04 % and 4.14 % in 12 countries, respectively), followed by SDG 2 (zero hunger) (approximately 4.31 % in 11 countries), and SDG 13 (climate action) had the least synergies in most countries (approximately 0.47 % in seven countries) (Fig. 2 c). In contrast, the shares of trade-offs each SDG gained showed pronounced spatial variation across the 16 countries; for example, most trade-offs of an individual SDG were often found in SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) but only in five countries (approximately 4.71 %) (Fig. 2 c). We measured the temporal variation in SDG interactions from 2000 to 2020 using yearly SDG scores for the AWT region (Figs. 3  , S18 to S38). From 2000 to 2020, a slight decrease in the fluctuation can be found in the shares of synergies among the SDGs in the AWT region (from 16.8 % to 15.44 %) (Fig. 3 a). The largest shares of synergies appeared in 2004, 2010, and 2011 (16.91 %), whereas the least occurred in 2007 (13.24 %) (Fig. 3 a). Meanwhile, the shares of trade-offs among SDGs have gradually weakened over 21 years (from 11.76 % to 8.09 %) (Fig. 3 b). The largest shares of trade-offs were found in 2002 and 2012 (12.5 %), and the smallest shares were found in 2019 (5.15 %) (Fig. 3 b). The synergies among SDGs in the AWT region outweighed the trade-offs every year, with the largest difference in 2017 (9.56 %) and the smallest difference in 2007 and 2012 (2.94 %) (Fig. 3 a and b). From 2000 to 2020, the shares of synergies of five SDGs showed increases in fluctuations, and among them, SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) had the largest change (0.74 %) (Fig. 3 c and Table S4a). In contrast, the shares of synergies were declined in six SDGs, for which the largest changes (0.74 %) occurred in SDGs 4 (quality education), 5 (gender equality), and 10 (reduced inequalities) (Fig. 3 c and Table S4a). The shares of trade-offs of most SDGs were declined over the years (approximately 0.37 %), especially for SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) (1.47 %), but only SDGs 13 (climate action) and 17 (partnerships for the goals) had increased shares of trade-offs (0.37 %) (Fig. 3 d and Table S4b). Moreover, SDG 4 (quality education) gained the most synergies in each year (approximately 2.22 %), except in 2013, followed by SDGs 3 (good health and well-being) and 11 (sustainable cities and communities) (approximately 1.72 %), and SDGs 1 (no poverty), 13 (climate action), and 15 (life on land) had the least synergies in most years (approximately 0.33 %) (Fig. 3 c and Table S4a). On the other hand, almost every year except 2010, SDGs 13 and 10 (reduced inequalities) had the most and least shares of trade-offs (approximately 2.3 % and 0.04 %), respectively (Fig. 3 d and Table S4b). Notably, SDGs 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), 15, and 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) presented no synergies or trade-offs with any SDGs in six out of 21 years, and SDGs 1 and 7 (affordable and clean energy) had no interactions with any SDGs in five and four of these years, respectively (Figs. S18 to S38).  3.2 Prioritizations of SDGs On the basis of the interactions among SDGs (Fig. 1 a), we constructed a network of the synergies and trade-offs in the AWT region over 21 years (2000–2020) and assessed the weighted degree centrality (i.e., network impact) of each SDG to reveal the key SDGs that dominate SDG interactions and prioritize the 17 SDGs (the larger the impacts are, the higher the prioritizations). The results (Fig. 4 a ) showed that among the 17 SDGs, SDGs 3 (good health and well-being), 6 (clean water and sanitation), and 4 (quality education) had the greatest network impacts (i.e., prioritizations), followed by SDGs 13 (climate action) and 11 (sustainable cities and communities), while SDG 14 (life below water) had the smallest network impacts. Robustness tests showed that regardless of whether nonsignificant values of Spearman's correlation coefficients were included or Pearson correlation coefficients were adopted to assess the interactions among the SDGs, the top three SDGs were the same as those mentioned above, although with slightly different prioritization, and the prioritizations of most SDGs fluctuated by less than three places (Fig. 4 b and c). We further revealed the spatial and temporal variation in SDG prioritizations (network impacts). Spatially, among the 16 countries, the network impacts (weighted degree centralities) of the 17 SDGs in Nepal had the largest differences (from 0.67 of SDG 1 [no poverty] to 14.12 of SDG 4 [quality education]), and China had the smallest (from 9.41 of SDG 15 [life on land] to 14.73 of SDG 1) (Fig. 5  ). The SDG prioritizations varied spatially across countries. The prioritization differences of the same SDG in different countries ranged from 8 (e.g., SDG 3 [good health and well-being] in Afghanistan and China) to 16 (e.g., SDG 11 [sustainable cities and communities] in India and Myanmar) (Fig. 5 ). In general, SDGs 2 (zero hunger), 3, and 6 (clean water and sanitation) had high prioritizations in most countries, whereas the lowest prioritization was often SDG 11 (Fig. 5 ). Regarding temporal variations, from 2000 to 2020, the interaction network impacts (centrality scores) of eight SDGs showed increases in fluctuations, for which SDG 1 (no poverty) had the largest change (156.82 %), followed by SDGs 6 (clean water and sanitation) (88.38 %) and 7 (affordable and clean energy) (88.32 %), whereas the smallest increase was found in SDG 14 (life below water) (2.06 %) (Fig. 6 a ). In contrast, the other nine SDGs had decreased interaction network impacts over 21 years; centrality scores changed the most and least in SDGs 12 (responsible consumption and production) (467.8 %) and 15 (life on land) (10.38 %), respectively (Fig. 6 a). Notably, although we considered the magnitude of the network impact (centrality) of an SDG as its priority level, the large or small variability of its network impact across time does not necessarily equate with its change in prioritization. For example, the prioritizations of SDGs 1 and 12 had the largest changes (seven places) from 2000 to 2020, and the prioritizations of SDGs 2 (zero hunger), 8 (decent work and economic growth), and 14 showed variability of only one place across time (Fig. 6 b). Overall, SDGs 4 (quality education), 6 (clean water and sanitation), and 13 (climate action) dominated the interactions in most years, followed by SDGs 3 (good health and well-being), 11 (sustainable cities and communities), and 2, whereas SDGs 10 (reduced inequalities) and 15 had low prioritizations in most years (Fig. 6 b).   4 Discussion Equal importance across 17 SDGs suggested by the 2030 agenda does not indicate that equal efforts are required to achieve each SDG (Xiao et al., 2022 ). Analyzing SDG interactions is fundamental for prioritizing SDGs and implementing effective actions to advance the progress toward them (Breu et al., 2021 ; Huan and Zhu, 2022 ). Global- and national-scale analyses have emerged (e.g., Kroll et al., 2019 ; Warchold et al., 2020 ; Laumann et al., 2022 ; Zhang et al., 2022 ), yet regional analyses have been overwhelmingly ignored. On the one hand, global targets and actions can be generally vague, and shifting them directly into practical and implementable actions at the national scale is challenging (Pham-Truffert et al., 2020 ), as indicated by the fact that Asian countries are still not on track to achieve any of the SDGs by 2030 (Sachs et al., 2022 ). On the other hand, although national-scale actions can be effective, they rarely consider larger scales (Zhu et al., 2021 ). If global actions are determined only by summing different actions for different countries in a simplistic way, key SDG interactions may be missed, which can further lower some SDG prioritizations and hamper global progress toward SDGs (Huan et al., 2023 ). Hence, performing more analyses at the regional scale is necessary to build a bridge between global and national analyses (Reyers and Selig, 2020 ). 4.1 Promotion of development consistency across countries Many previous studies have assessed the SDG interactions at the global and national levels and highlighted that within all 17 SDGs, synergies outweigh trade-offs (Pradhan et al., 2017 ; Warchold et al., 2020 ), which is consistent with our findings (Fig. 1 ). More importantly, this study provides new insights into the promotion of sustainable development consistency across countries. Our results observed a striking spatial variation in the SDG interactions in the AWT region (e.g., differences between China and Turkmenistan) (Fig. 2 ), which might be minimized by promoting balanced progress toward SDGs 1 (no poverty), 5 (gender equality), and 11 (sustainable cities and communities) across countries. High synergies (>50 %) among SDGs were mainly presented in the central and southern parts of the AWT region (e.g., China, India, and Laos) (Fig. 2 a), indicating that they might have more plausible development paradigms. Taking China as an example, although its rapid economic growth has benefited more from trades in its eastern plains and coastal provinces, which has increased the pressure on resource and energy extraction and ecological conservation in the western area (Lu et al., 2019 ), a series of actions has led it to perform synergistic interactions among SDGs, such as green infrastructure construction, talent introduction, and ecological restoration (Huang et al., 2012 ; Siehr et al., 2022 ; Zhang et al., 2022 ). Notably, maintaining the current rates of progress toward SDGs in these countries would not ensure their full achievement of SDGs (Sachs et al., 2022 ). Achieving substantial development progress without breaking or weakening the synergies among SDGs can be quite challenging for these countries. Countries with high trade-offs (>25 %) among SDGs were mostly distributed in the central and southeast areas of the AWT region (e.g., Thailand, Nepal, and Pakistan) (Fig. 2 b), where SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth), 12 (responsible consumption and production), and 13 (climate action) generally had the most trade-offs (Fig. 2 c). These findings emphasize that progress made for these SDGs may have come at the cost of other SDGs, thus, these countries are not achieving the level of progress as desired (Wu et al., 2022 ). For example, past assessments have indicated that current progress toward SDG 12 in Thailand might be unstainable (Sachs et al., 2022 ); for example, multiple public and private sector efforts in Thailand are attempting to transform the plastic value chain, whereas little effect has been made in reducing plastic pollution (Lee, 2021 ). Thus, substantial and rational changes to existing behavior patterns are required. Additionally, financial figures can help analyze the interactions among SDGs (e.g., Daher and Mohtar, 2021 ). These figures can be further included in the future assessments based on this study.  4.2 Transformation from SDG trade-offs to synergies This study deepens the understanding of SDG progress over time. The gradual weakened shares of trade-offs among SDGs from 2000 to 2021 (Fig. 3 b) imply that the AWT region has been shifting trade-offs to synergies, and the declining trade-offs of SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) mainly enabled this transformation (Fig. 3 d). However, such success seems to encounter worrying obstacles, including the slightly decreased shares of synergies of SDGs 4 (quality education), 5 (gender equality), and 10 (reduced inequalities) (Fig. 3 a and c) and, more importantly, the increased shares of trade-offs of SDGs 13 (climate action) and 17 (partnerships for the goals) (Fig. 3 d). Over decades, dramatic climate change has been a critical direct driver of change in nature and livelihoods in the AWT region (World Meteorological Organization, 2022 ), and previous causality analyses have highlighted that it can undermine 16 SDGs, while combatting it can reinforce all 17 SDGs (Nerini et al., 2019 ). Identifying synergized paths for climate actions (SDG 13) and social and economic development can be critical for addressing the obstacles faced by the transformation of SDG interactions. Additionally, the fact that partnerships (SDG 17) across the AWT region have caused higher trade-offs among SDGs (Fig. 3 d) indicates the urgent demands for governments (police-makers) in the region to undertake joint commitments, continuously set synergized goals, and accelerate collaborative across-scaled actions (Huan et al., 2023 ). Examples include identifying transboundary ecological network (Zhu et al., 2021 ) and regional collective energy development programs (Hussain et al., 2019 ). Sustainable transformation also calls for the cooperation of scientists (e.g., interdisciplinary collaborative research), nongovernmental organizations, and other stakeholders (Hassan et al., 2020 ; Wu et al., 2022 ).  4.3 Top prioritized SDGs at the regional level Our study can serve to accelerate the overall achievement of SDGs in the AWT region. We highlight the importance of enhancing good health (SDG 3), clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), quality education (SDG 4), climate actions (SDG 13), and sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), i.e., the highest prioritized five SDGs (Fig. 4 a). Mainstreaming both of these SDGs and specific targeted numerical values into regional strategies can create an effective starting point. Strengthening the breadth and depth of knowledge related to these SDGs is indispensable (Nerini et al., 2019 ); for example, understanding which discipline/sectors can be partners and which ones require negotiations (Xiao et al., 2022 ). Many studies combining expert elicitation and literature review or adopting causality analyses have identified the potential causalities of these and other SDGs (e.g., Griggs et al., 2017 ; Fader et al., 2018 ; Manandhar et al., 2018 ; Cernev and Fenner, 2020 ; Bandari et al., 2022 ). For example, for SDG 3 (i.e., the most dominant role in SDG interactions), progress toward SDGs 5 (gender equality), 6 (clean water), and 7 (clean energy), and many other SDGs can support it by improving reproductive and respiratory health and decreasing the spread of infectious disease (World Health Organization, 2014, 2015 ; Wang, 2016 ). Importantly, good health (SDG 3) can also be a main enabler, such as its strong enabling impacts on poverty reduction (SDG 1) and economic growth (SDG 8) (Griggs et al., 2017 ; Wu et al., 2022 ). The general description of potential causal relations between the rest of the four top prioritized SDGs and other SDGs is available in the Supplementary Information.  4.4 Keys to success at the national level In addition to focusing on regional strategies and actions, we need to further identify contextualized policies at the national scale, given that different countries are concrete actors in achieving SDGs (Sterling et al., 2020 ). Our results of SDG interactions and prioritizations for each country (Figs. 2 and 5 ) provide evidence-based support to develop such policies for countries at different development stages. These findings can help allocate resources within countries, guide regulation (e.g., making funding flows even and efficient) (Kroll et al., 2019 ), simplify actions toward SDGs, and encourage private investments to address the top challenges faced by sustainable transformation (Huan and Zhu, 2022 ). Some keys to success at the national level need to be considered. First, broader and coherent policy and investment mixes (Morrison et al., 2019 ; Axsen et al., 2020 ), instead of focusing on economic growth, social inclusion, or green economy in isolation, which can waste chances for greater achievements (Allen et al., 2019b ). To do so, having a leading institution responsible for SDGs and conducting indicator-level studies (e.g., the non-linear relationships, threshold effects, and causalities among indicators) can be useful (Nerini et al., 2019 ; Zhang et al., 2022 ). Second, departments of the public (and private) sectors need to break down certain barriers (Le Blanc, 2015 ). Possible logical steps include mapping the nexus type of different sectoral actions related to top prioritized SDGs (Zhang et al., 2019 ), assessing the present status of the nexus among sectors (e.g., tension or de-escalation) (Wang et al., 2021 ), and assessing risks (Weitz et al., 2017 ). Furthermore, diverse groups of stakeholders with deep local expertise in decision-making need to be involved (Laumann et al., 2022 ). For example, the benefits of including local knowledge for addressing issues related to climate change have been clearly explored (Hosen and Nakamura, 2020 ).  4.5 Limitations and uncertainties Several limitations and uncertainties in the methodology are noteworthy. First, for indicator-based assessments including ours, adopting different indicators can affect the results (Huan et al., 2022 ). In addition, filling in the missing data can cause uncertainties in the SDG scores, given that different interpolation approaches have different focuses and potential errors (Huan et al., 2019 ). To avoid this issue as much as possible, we considered the combined use of a series of interpolation approaches based on Huan et al., 2021b, 2022 ). We highlight that governments, local stakeholders, and society should promote collecting and sharing data and knowledge to help organize information, identify indicators, and improve assessment accuracy. Third, the Spearman's correlation coefficients were used as proxies for mapping interactions among SDGs, which do not imply causality (Le Blanc, 2015 ). Causation analyses go beyond the scope of this study but can be further established in many of the SDG interactions we assessed. Spatial and temporal variations in causalities among SDGs should be performed comprehensively in future research. Fourth, global SDG progress has been hindered by the impacts of evolving COVID-19 variants since 2020 (Ranjbari et al., 2021 ) and the war in Ukraine in 2022 (International Energy Agency, et al., 2022 ). Given that we did not analyze regional data from 2021 to 2022, more analyses are required in the future based on our results. Moreover, the second- or higher-order network impacts of SDGs (e.g., Toth et al., 2021 ) were not assessed in this study, causing less accurate SDG prioritizations. Even so, the first-order SDG interactions can be informative enough and usually have much greater impacts on the results (Allen et al., 2019a ).   5 Conclusion Given that the target date for SDG achievement is less than eight years away, more efforts from all actors are urgently required. This study revealed the complex SDG interactions in the AWT region from 2000 to 2020, and based on these interactions, prioritization for each SDG was set for the region. Our results showed a larger share of synergies than trade-offs among the 17 SDGs; and progress toward SDGs 3 (good health and well-being), 4 (quality education), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 11 (sustainable cities and communities), and 13 (climate actions) was prioritized for achieving as many SDGs as possible by 2030. This study also proves the necessity of researching the spatial differences and temporal variations in SDG interactions and prioritizations at the regional scale, and can begin to lay a foundation for such analyses of other regions. In the AWT region, both the SDG interactions and prioritizations showed striking spatial differences, which may be minimized by promoting balanced progress toward SDGs 1 (no poverty), 5 (gender equality), and 11 across countries. Temporally, the SDG trade-offs in the region have possibly been shifting to synergies, whereas the climate change and a lack of partnerships could be the main obstacles of future success. The prioritizations of SDGs 1 and 12 (responsible consumption and production) showed the largest increase and decrease, respectively, over time. For policy-makers, researchers, and other stakeholders, plural actions were also provided at regional and national levels, such as across-scaled cooperation, interdisciplinary research, and sectoral transformation. Overall, this study does provide some novel and interesting insights into understanding the sustainable development process and identifying SDG prioritizations and actions, which should continue to be a research subject that requires attention even after 2030.
