                  The study examines the determinants and consequences of firm-level Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) disclosure using a sample of 6941 firm-year observations from 30 countries during 2016–2019. Based on 17 SDG indicators developed by the United Nations (UN), the study forms an SDG Disclosure Index. The findings reveal that approximately 48.40% of firms in the sample had active stakeholder engagement programs, 53.90% maintained a sustainability committee, and 62.60% issued standalone sustainability reports. The findings indicate that Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance, stakeholder engagement, and the issuance of standalone sustainability reports positively influence firm-level SDG disclosure. Moreover, the study finds a positive association between higher levels of SDG disclosure and increased firm value. Our findings are robust using a battery of robustness tests. Given the growing global focus on SDGs and the extent of SDG disclosure by firms, this study's findings hold significant implications for decision-makers and other stakeholders.

To determine the most suitable regression model for the analysis, we employ Hausman's (1978) test to select a preferred regression model for the analysis. The test results provide support for utilising a regression model with random effects for year and industry, emphasising their importance in the analysis. Furthermore, we conduct the Breusch–Pagan Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test to determine between random effects or OLS regression in selecting the model, with the test results supporting OLS regression. We also test validity for year and industry fixed effects, with the F-test results supporting year and industry fixed effects. Therefore, we estimate the pooled OLS model with year and industry fixed effects. Furthermore, we employ robust standard errors clustered at the firm level to control for heteroscedasticity and serial correlation issues in our study's regression models. Additionally, variance inflation factor (VIF) values are used to check for potential multicollinearity.   item S0959-6526(23)04179-3 S0959652623041793 1-s2.0-S0959652623041793 10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.140021 271750 2024-06-14T07:05:37.087951Z 2024-01-01 UNLIMITED CAUL2023 1-s2.0-S0959652623041793-main.pdf https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S0959652623041793/MAIN/application/pdf/6ed6d602ab00c65e980c0fa406c0fb26/main.pdf main.pdf pdf true 1499532 MAIN 19 1-s2.0-S0959652623041793-main_1.png https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S0959652623041793/PREVIEW/image/png/9a3859dceed572ed4a985810babc2e21/main_1.png main_1.png png 57055 849 656 IMAGE-WEB-PDF 1    1-s2.0-S0959652623041793-gr1.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S0959652623041793/gr1/DOWNSAMPLED/image/jpeg/12cd739a0def94f05e65c760e278c538/gr1.jpg gr1 gr1.jpg jpg 132805 338 691 IMAGE-DOWNSAMPLED  1-s2.0-S0959652623041793-ga1.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S0959652623041793/ga1/DOWNSAMPLED/image/jpeg/99474af34e8cb21ee13ebfd314cc7d3d/ga1.jpg ga1 true ga1.jpg jpg 117146 200 351 IMAGE-DOWNSAMPLED  1-s2.0-S0959652623041793-gr1.sml https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S0959652623041793/gr1/THUMBNAIL/image/gif/55888af489a5bbba6221e4552db997e9/gr1.sml gr1 gr1.sml sml 75326 107 219 IMAGE-THUMBNAIL  1-s2.0-S0959652623041793-ga1.sml https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S0959652623041793/ga1/THUMBNAIL/image/gif/0a6ea558b0c61a3865bb4b3910598006/ga1.sml ga1 true ga1.sml sml 84277 125 219 IMAGE-THUMBNAIL  1-s2.0-S0959652623041793-gr1_lrg.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S0959652623041793/HIGHRES/image/jpeg/79f8b05953ef6ced3e902a104537e043/gr1_lrg.jpg gr1 gr1_lrg.jpg jpg 623635 1495 3060 IMAGE-HIGH-RES  1-s2.0-S0959652623041793-ga1_lrg.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S0959652623041793/HIGHRES/image/jpeg/b958617564838af64e2f8a67b0783f75/ga1_lrg.jpg ga1 true ga1_lrg.jpg jpg 482360 886 1555 IMAGE-HIGH-RES  1-s2.0-S0959652623041793-am.pdf https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/egi:100R22XR30B/MAIN/application/pdf/cd7ae9a2b1dce9811e9d0be2248a2225/am.pdf am am.pdf pdf false 641137 AAM-PDF     JCLP 140021 140021 S0959-6526(23)04179-3 10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.140021 The Author(s)  Fig. 1 Research framework.

Based on 17 SDG indicators developed by the United Nations (UN), the study forms an SDG Disclosure Index. The findings reveal that approximately 48.40% of firms in the sample had active stakeholder engagement programs, 53.90% maintained a sustainability committee, and 62.60% issued standalone sustainability reports. The findings indicate that Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance, stakeholder engagement, and the issuance of standalone sustainability reports positively influence firm-level SDG disclosure. Moreover, the study finds a positive association between higher levels of SDG disclosure and increased firm value. Our findings are robust using a battery of robustness tests. Given the growing global focus on SDGs and the extent of SDG disclosure by firms, this study's findings hold significant implications for decision-makers and other stakeholders.

This initiative, seen as a global effort to tackle worldwide challenges, positions the achievement of these goals as a universal pathway to foster sustainable development (KPMG, 2018 ; United Nations [UN], 2015 ). Since the SDGs were introduced in 2015, there has been a surge of renewed momentum in both practical applications and academic research (United Nations [UN], 2015 ; Bose and Khan, 2022 ). According to a recent survey by KPMG (2018) , 40% of the world's 250 largest companies have incorporated SDG disclosures into their sustainability reports, highlighting a significant increase in business interest in the SDGs since their launch.1  1 Another more recent survey by KPMG (2020)  indicates a significant increase in business engagement with the UN's SDGs between 2017 and 2020, underscoring the growing resonance of these goals within the business community.   In this study, our primary motivation is to understand the determinants and consequences of SDG information disclosure, recognizing the timeliness and practical significance of this issue. With the United Nations (UN) advocating for collaboration among private sector firms, governments, and other stakeholders in SDG implementation, it becomes imperative to understand the role of private sector entities, particularly those listed in capital markets, in adopting SDGs. The UN (2021) in its recent report calls for a stronger role by national regulators in mandating the disclosure of SDG information. This report also emphasizes the need for cooperation from private sector firms operating in capital markets, underlining the importance of reporting, accountability, and transparency in relation to SDG information (United Nations [UN], 2020 , 202).2  2 Additionally, the UN highlights in a separate report the pivotal role capital market firms can play in financing SDG-related projects globally. This report notes that financing by listed firms for areas covered by the SDGs was evident from 2015 to 2020. However, a detailed discussion of this aspect is beyond the scope of the current study.   Additionally, participants in capital markets are likely to be interested in understanding the commitments of listed firms to the SDGs and, crucially, how shareholders might benefit from such endeavours. Understanding SDG disclosure and its implications is crucial for various participants in the capital market. For instance, shareholders gain insights into how managerial commitments to SDGs translate into stock market performance and whether these commitments reflect judicious use of shareholder funds. If a firm's implementation of SDGs positively impacts performance, managers can justify the continuation of such initiatives, presenting them as prudent use of shareholders' investments. Furthermore, these insights can guide national regulators in determining the need for mandatory (‘hard’) versus voluntary SDG regulations, tailored to the local context and the status of SDG adoption by firms. Additionally, as SDG implementation is a priority for the UN, the findings of this study are instrumental in shaping the UN's policy-making and action plans. These plans could involve collaborating with national regulators to facilitate effective SDG implementation and assessing the actual state of affairs. The UN (2021) emphasizes that beyond workshops and promises, tangible actions and commitments from both private and public sectors are essential for achieving SDGs (United Nations [UN], 2021 ; 2015 ). Furthermore, from an academic perspective, this study aims to contribute to the relatively sparse literature on the capital market responses to firms' SDG disclosure. Given that firms' commitment to the SDGs entails costs (Vorisek and Yu, 2020 ), it is generally expected that such investments in sustainable development activities should lead to enhanced firm performance (Hill and Jones, 1992 ). However, there is a surprising scarcity of empirical studies that confirm this relationship. This gap has led academic researchers to call for more investigations into the impact of SDGs and how private sector firms are integrating these goals, along with the resultant consequences (Hummel and Szekely, 2022 ; van der Waal and Thijssens, 2020 ; Lenort et al., 2023 ). The current study seeks to address this gap. Overall, the study aims to answer two key research questions: RQ-1: What are the determinants influencing firm-level disclosure of SDG activities? RQ-2: Does firm-level SDG disclosure have a positive effect on the market value of firms? Using a sample of firms from 30 countries from 2016 to 2019, the study examines the firm-level determinants and firm-value effects of SDG disclosure worldwide. The study utilises the 17 SDG indicators developed by the UN as its SDG Disclosure Index. The results indicate that environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance, stakeholder engagement, and the issuance of standalone sustainability reports are the major factors driving firm-level SDG disclosure. Interestingly, the study finds no relationship between SDG disclosure and the presence of a sustainability committee on the board. The study also finds that SDG disclosure is positively associated with firm value, suggesting that capital markets respond favourably to firms’ SDG commitments that enhance firm value. Our firm value results are robust after addressing endogeneity arising from unobservable and observable selection bias using Heckman (1979)  two-stage model, entropy balancing and two-stage analyses. Furthermore, the study finds the moderating roles of country-level institutional factors such as business culture, economic development, and governance quality on the relationship between SDG disclosure and firm value, highlighting the influence of broader institutional contexts on this relationship. The current study is novel in several ways. To illustrate, the study has explored the firm-level factors influencing SDG disclosure using global-level data, and whether firms' implementation of SDGs has a pay-off (or not) for shareholders in the capital market (shareholders’ value maximisation). Not only were these factors conceptualised using established stakeholder theory, but the theoretical model was also rigorously tested empirically. The validity of the results is further reinforced by a series of robustness tests. To our knowledge, this study is the first to develop and empirically validate a conceptual model for the determinants and consequences of SDG disclosure using global data. These findings introduce new perspectives to existing literature, making significant contributions to both academic research and practical applications, as detailed in Section 7 . The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2  presents the literature review and identified research gaps, while Section 3  provides the theoretical background and develops the study's hypotheses. Section 4  reports on the research methodology, followed by presentation of the study's empirical results in Section 5 . Section 6  discusses the additional analyses and findings, as well as the robustness test results. The final section (Section 7 ) concludes the paper and discusses the study's implications and limitations.  2 Literature review and identification of research gaps 2.1 Necessity for business firms to address sustainable development goals (SDGs) The SDGs enable firms to re-focus and re-think their business model, with this essential not only for solving worldwide problems, but also for providing benefits to firms themselves (United Nations [UN], 2015; Bose and Khan, 2022 ). With a set of 17 interrelated goals and 244 indicators, the SDGs specify the desired outcomes of sustainable development across the world to create a better and more habitable planet by 2030 (United Nations [UN], 2015; Bose and Khan, 2022 ). As all the SDGs are interrelated, firms' actions towards improving one area are expected to have compounding effects in other areas. This results in adequate adjustments of social, economic, and environmental sustainability agenda, a core theme of the triple bottom line concept (Lenort et al., 2023 ). When firms’ decision makers embrace the essence of the SDGs, long-term sustainable benefits will result not only for their funding providers but also, in many ways, for all other stakeholders. These benefits include, among others, reducing inequality and ensuring diversity in the workforce; addressing climate change; taking care of the natural environment; receiving social acceptance; and increasing the satisfaction of different stakeholders, such as customers, employees, suppliers, communities, etc. (Adams, 2017 ; Bose and Khan, 2022 ).3  3 Detailed discussions of these benefits are beyond the scope of the current paper but are discussed elsewhere in the literature.   The sustainability theme is one of the key tactics used by firms to be competitive in the market, regularly communicating the implementation of such strategies to display their commitments to social, environmental, and economic performance (Bose and Khan, 2022 ). When decision makers of firms embrace sustainability/sustainable development, they define sustainable development areas; set strategic goals/targets, priorities and activities; allocate resources; communicate with internal and external stakeholders; and regularly evaluate the achievement of their goals (Khan et al., 2021 ; Khan et al., 2020 ). It has been argued that the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (United Nations [UN] Global Compact, 2021 ) and through the SDGs, the UN is calling for immediate global partnership in action to achieve various social and environmental parameters over and above the economic parameter of sustainability (Lenort et al., 2023 ; United Nations [UN] Global Compact, 2021). These include poverty alleviation; zero hunger; improving education; health, and social protection; ensuring gender equality; clean energy; responsible consumption and production; and protection against climate change and environmental risks (Bose and Khan, 2022 ; Lenort et al., 2023 ; United Nations [UN], 2022 ). The success of the SDGs is largely dependent on collective efforts from UN member states and all types of stakeholders (e.g., government, policy makers, consumers, managers, industry associations, non-governmental organisations [NGOs], etc.) (Bose and Khan, 2022 ; Subramaniam et al., 2023 ; United Nations [UN], 2022).  2.2 Review of previous studies on SDG disclosure and gaps in the literature Within the available SDG literature, the study by Rosati and Faria (2019a)  presented empirical evidence using data from firms in 90 different countries. They found that country-level institutional factors (e.g., politics and law, economics and finance, society and culture, technology and innovation, education and labour, and sustainability) affected SDG adoption as indicated in firms' non-financial reporting. In another study using data from 408 firms, Rosati and Faria (2019b)  provided evidence that organisational factors (e.g., a firm's size, higher level of intangible assets, higher commitment to sustainability frameworks and external assurance, higher proportion of female directors and a younger board of directors) were related to SDG disclosure. The study by Ike et al. (2019) , in evaluating a sample of decision makers from Japanese companies, identified the main factors influencing the prioritisation of the SDGs within non-financial reports. A very recent study by Bose and Khan (2022)  showed that SDG disclosure by global firms, while at a low level, is increasing over time. The authors indicated that this reporting is influenced by country-level factors, such as sustainability regulations at the national level, the governance model (shareholder-oriented vs stakeholder-oriented countries) and the economic status of countries. They also noted that a higher level of SDG disclosure was found for firms in shareholder-oriented countries than in stakeholder-oriented countries, and for firms in developing countries than in developed countries (Bose and Khan, 2022 ). Other studies have also explored other key issues relating to the SDGs, for example, drivers of the SDGs for family firms (Patuelli et al., 2022 ); understanding adoption of the SDGs by private firms (Calabrese et al., 2022 ); SDGs adoption by the worldwide automotive industry (Lenort et al., 2023 ); whether the nature of SDGs reporting is symbolic or cosmetic (Emma and Jennifer, 2021 ); the quality and quantity of SDGs disclosure (Subramaniam et al., 2023 ); and the SDGs in African nations (Gyimah et al., 2023 ). The above-mentioned previous studies have enhanced the understanding of SDG practices and firm-level SDG disclosure. However, the current study differs from previous studies at the theoretical level and in its empirical approach. For example, although the study by Rosati and Faria (2019a)  considered some country-level factors, it is also important to consider organisational-level factors as they are likely to affect firm-level SDG disclosure. Likewise, while different organisational factors have been considered in prior studies (Rosati and Faria, 2019b ), other key organisational factors (e.g., ESG performance, stakeholder engagement, presence of a sustainability committee, issuance of standalone sustainability reports, etc.) could have an impact on SDG disclosure but, surprisingly, have remained unexplored to date. The current study considers these organisational factors and aims to fill these gaps in the literature. In addition, Pizzi et al. (2021) , in their recent study in Italy, reported a positive relationship between a firm's SDG disclosure and organisational factors, such as report type, as well as governance factors, namely, the presence of independent directors on the board, the firm's expertise with non-financial disclosure, etc. However, their study was limited to one country and did not explore a key governance factor, namely, the presence of a separate sustainability committee at board level. The current study's literature review also shows that the few available insights into firms' SDG disclosure practices are often limited to binary measurements of SDG disclosure (García-Sánchez et al., 2020 ; Rosati and Faria, 2019a ; Rosati and Faria, 2019b ), a single disclosure year (Rosati and Faria, 2019a ; Rosati and Faria, 2019b ) or a specific country (Gunawan et al., 2020 ). None of these studies have considered the development and progress of SDG disclosure over multiple years in multiple industries. In the literature, the study by Bose and Khan (2022)  explored SDG disclosure trends over time, as well as the influences of country-level factors on SDG disclosure in multiple countries. However, Bose and Khan's (2022)  study did not explore neither firm-level factors that influence SDG disclosure nor the impact of SDG disclosure on firm performance. Hummel and Szekely (2022)  explored some determinants of SDG disclosure (e.g., relevance to financial stakeholders, namely, socially responsible investors and financial analysts; controversies published in the media; and industry type) using data from European countries. However, Hummel and Szekely (2022)  study is differed from our study. Specifically, our study considers a different set of determinants, namely, ESG performance, stakeholder engagement, standalone sustainability reporting and the presence of a sustainability committee (a key corporate governance element). Additionally, our study explores the consequences of SDG disclosure on firm value. Lastly, the study investigates a global sample, in comparison to the Hummel and Szekely (2022)  study, thus providing research opportunities to extend the literature. Overall, previous studies on the SDGs have not investigated the impact of SDG disclosure on firms' value. As empirical evidence in this regard is lacking, academic investigation is needed on whether firms are endeavouring to achieve their SDGs, and whether their SDG disclosure is positively welcomed by stock market actors (through increasing shareholders' value in the long term). Arguably, firms' decision makers will be motivated to invest their resources and time in the SDGs when firms' fund providers are receiving benefits from the disclosure of SDG information.   3 Theoretical background and hypotheses development Stakeholder theory explains how firms respond to their stakeholders' demands to obtain a competitive advantage and to ensure their long-term survival in society (Hill and Jones, 1992 ). The current study employs stakeholder theory as its theoretical framework. This theory encompasses the view that while firms prioritise the needs of their most important and powerful stakeholders, their success is likely to depend on also prioritising the needs of all stakeholders (Hillman and Keim, 2001 ). Moreover, an implicit social contract exists between the firm and individuals affected by its operation (Freeman, 2010 ). In line with stakeholder theory, it is argued that the existence of non-financial stakeholders (e.g., the media, regulators, etc.) can influence firms’ SDG disclosure. These stakeholders exert pressure and push firms to actively participate in SDG accomplishment. On the specific issue of the SDGs adoption, it has been argued that stakeholder engagement and participation are critical parameters for the successful implementation of SDGs and the reporting of SDG information (United Nations [UN], 2020). Without adequate multi-stakeholder engagement and participation, the SDGs cannot be implemented in a transparent manner or, if implemented, would be incomplete, as implementation would not be aligned with the core values of the SDGs, namely, the principles of justice, fairness, and equity (Jensen and Berg, 2012 ; Rendtorff, 2020 ; Smith et al., 2005 ). Therefore, firms that maintain stakeholder relationships are expected to be more likely to disclose their SDG activities. Furthermore, stakeholder theory argues that firms which satisfy implicit stakeholder claims enhance their reputation, experiencing a beneficial effect on firm performance (Freeman, 2010 ). Several studies have documented that firms can achieve and maintain superior performance through effective stakeholder management (Choi and Wang, 2009 ; Hillman and Keim, 2001 ). 3.1 Determinants of sustainable development goal (SDG) disclosure (RQ-1) The current study considers several firm-level factors (e.g., environmental, social and governance [ESG] performance, stakeholder engagement, presence of a sustainability committee and issuance of standalone sustainability reports) that would drive firms to SDG disclosure. These factors are considered potentially significant in pushing towards firm-level SDG disclosure, with their related arguments discussed in the following sub-sections. 3.1.1 Environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance and SDG disclosure In recent years, scholars have highlighted that firms' environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance signals their care for society and the environment (Eccles and Serafeim, 2013 ; Hummel and Szekely, 2022 ; Li et al., 2018 ; Qiu et al., 2016 ). From the perspective of stakeholder theory, it is argued that ESG performance enables firms to display their commitment towards sustainability and meeting stakeholder expectations (Chen et al., 2022 ; Eccles and Serafeim, 2013 ; Li et al., 2018 ; Qiu et al., 2016 ). In this regard, the ESG performance rating achieved by firms signals to investors and other players in the market. For example, being aware of ESG performance scores, investors and other market players can understand the actual commitment by firms to sustainability activities (Eccles and Serafeim, 2013 ). This brings numerous benefits for firms, such as improved market reputation, social acceptance, and trust (Brooks and Oikonomou, 2018 ; Cohen and Simnett, 2015 ). Typically produced by renowned agencies such as Dow Jones, ASSET4 and Bloomberg among others, firms’ ESG performance scores primarily have credentials in the market and are valued by investors and other stakeholders (Chatterji et al., 2016 ). Furthermore, information on ESG performance reduces information asymmetry in the market and provides thorough, organised, and comparable performance information for a number of publicly listed firms across similar firms and across industries (Cappucci, 2018 ; Clementino and Perkins, 2020 ; Cohen and Simnett, 2015 ; Solomon and Solomon, 2006 ). In the case of SDG implementation, it is likely that firms with a higher ESG performance score will have a greater level of SDG disclosure than firms with a lower ESG performance score. In the current study, we expect that firms' ESG performance is likely to positively influence SDG disclosure. The reason is that firms with a higher ESG performance score will have a sound and established preparedness, as well as resources for holistic SDG implementation and for the disclosure of SDG information. When firms have a sound ESG performance score, this indicates that they are better prepared and have an adequate internal structure for SDG implementation. Therefore, firms' aptitude for SDG implementation and for disclosure of SDG performance information would rise if they had better ESG performance. In other words, a firm with a higher level of ESG performance would be inclined to adopt the SDGs and would have a higher level of SDG disclosure due to its established track record for sustainability and non-financial performance in the market. Therefore, our study's hypothesis is formally stated as:H1 Environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance of firms positively influences their level of SDG disclosure .    3.1.2 Stakeholder engagement and SDG disclosure In the sustainability literature, ongoing stakeholder engagement is considered an essential task for firms not only for the growth of a sustainable development program but also for effective implementation of sustainable business practices and their disclosure (Kaur and Lodhia, 2018 ; Rinaldi et al., 2014 ). In the light of stakeholder theory, studies have emphasised the inclusion and engagement of a broad range of stakeholders in firms' sustainability activities to avoid an expectation gap with society (Rinaldi et al., 2014 ; Unerman, 2007 ). In fact, if meaningful stakeholder engagement is absent, firms' sustainability endeavours will be wasted and their sustainability practices will be ‘ceremonial’ as they will fail to meet stakeholder expectations, resulting in a lack of trustworthiness in firms' sustainability information (Khan et al., 2021 ; Kaur and Lodhia, 2018 ; Rodrigue et al., 2013 ). The empirical study by Kaur and Lodhia (2018)  on the Australian public sector provided evidence that all-inclusive stakeholder engagement is necessary for comprehensive sustainability initiatives and for the disclosure of all sustainability activities. In a recent study, Khan et al. (2021)  reported that engaging and maintaining ongoing dialogue with stakeholders enables banks to increase the reliability and credibility of their sustainability disclosure information. In the case of SDG implementation and disclosure, the United Nations [UN] has explicitly emphasised and recognised that partnerships with multiple stakeholders are essential in all phases of SDG implementation (United Nations [UN], 2015). Engagement and partnership with different stakeholders are required as this engagement aligns the interests as well as the voices of varied stakeholders in a unified manner (MacDonald et al., 2019 ; United Nations [UN], 2015). From the above discussion, the study argues that without stakeholder engagement, SDGs will never materialise in an authentic form (de Bakker et al., 2019 ; United Nations [UN], 2015). In addition, firms' stakeholder engagement and dialogue initiatives enable firms' decision-makers to be inclusive, and to develop solid partnerships and dialogue with multiple stakeholders. These will enable them to understand stakeholders' latest demands and expectations for sustainable development programs. Although no previous study has investigated the impact of stakeholder engagement on SDG disclosure, it is predicted that firms’ stakeholder engagement practices play a positive role in their willingness to embrace SDG disclosure. Accordingly, the study proposes that:H2 The presence of stakeholder engagement practices in firms positively influences the level of SDG disclosure .    3.1.3 Presence of a sustainability committee and SDG disclosure Scholars have argued that internal governance factors are likely to have an impact on sustainability disclosure practices (Peters and Romi, 2014 , 2015 ). It has been argued that the identification of sustainability themes, risks and opportunities; ‘materiality’ issues; overall sustainability activities, and the disclosure of sustainability information comprise a difficult and massive exercise, which poses more challenges for board members than the monitoring of traditional financial information (Helfaya and Whittington, 2019 ; Peters and Romi, 2015 ; World Business Council for Sustainable Development [WBCSD], 2019 ). As a result, these challenges require input from the presence of a knowledgeable resource person on the board, that is, an expert on sustainability and sustainable development themes (Helfaya and Whittington, 2019 ; Peters and Romi, 2015 ). To mitigate these challenges, firms, in practice, increasingly recognise the need for the introduction of a separate sustainability committee at board level (Rodrigue et al., 2013 ; World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), 2019). The presence of a sustainability committee influences the disclosure of high-quality non-financial information (Helfaya and Whittington, 2019 ) and non-financial disclosure, as evidenced in different empirical studies (Peters and Romi, 2014 ; Subramaniam et al., 2023 ) with their arguments that the existence of a subcommittee responsible for sustainability issues is likely to be the key to SDG adoption. In the specific case of SDG disclosure, the current study argues that the presence of a sustainability committee at board level would signal the firm's clear orientation and commitment to sustainability and an implementation of SDG agenda. The study predicts that the sustainability committee, through the knowledge and expertise of committee members, will make tangible changes and improvement in the firm's SDG implementation and disclosure and in monitoring the latter. Indeed, having a separate sustainability committee within a firm's board structure is highly important for SDG implementation and disclosure of related information. The reason is that sustainability committee members can assist board members in implementing policies and procedures for sustainability, monitoring sustainability performance progress; and, overall, overseeing the disclosure of SDG performance. Recent literature includes two studies that have considered internal factors, for example, the presence of a sustainability committee in the Italian context (Pizzi et al., 2021 ) and the presence of a sustainability committee in the Australian context (Subramaniam et al., 2023 ). These studies provide initial evidence of the role of a sustainability committee in a firm's SDG disclosure. However, each of these studies was based on only a single country, with more empirical evidence is required at the global level. The current study proposes that a sustainability committee is likely to affect a firm's SDG disclosure. Formally stated:H3 The presence of a sustainability committee at board level in the firm positively influences the level of SDG disclosure .    3.1.4 Issuance of standalone sustainability reporting and SDG disclosure In recent years, firms in different countries have paid increasing attention to the disclosure of non-financial information in a new disclosure format, namely, the use of separate standalone sustainability reporting (KPMG, 2020 ). Furthermore, following national initiatives relating to sustainability and green laws in many countries, firms now include their non-financial information within their traditional financial reports (Clarkson, 1995 ; Khan et al., 2021 ). Nevertheless, scholars have suggested that standalone reports be used by firms for non-financial information, as standalone reporting of sustainability information signals the high level of a firm's commitment and devotion to sustainability issues and sustainable development agenda. Mahoney et al. (2013)  argued that when non-financial disclosure (such as CSR disclosure) is developed in a standalone manner, this improves its credibility to stakeholders. In the light of stakeholder theory (Clarkson, 1995 ; Mahoney et al., 2013 ), it is argued that if stakeholders recognise a sustainability report as a sign of “good” corporate citizenship, then firms would respond to stakeholders' pressure by issuing standalone sustainability reports. Mahoney et al. (2013)  argued that firms which produce standalone CSR reports have stronger CSR performance than their counterparts. The current study expects that firms' adoption of standalone reports for sustainability information will positively influence SDG disclosure. The reason is that various bodies, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), have suggested that these standalone reports not only impart useful information by its disclosure to stakeholders, but also enable stakeholders to have a clear understanding of the different impacts of internal and external sustainability issues (Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) & United Nations [UN] Global Compact, 2017 ). The empirical study by Pizzi et al. (2021) , in the Italian context, provided evidence that standalone disclosure of sustainability performance is positively associated with SDG disclosure. However, at the global level when addressing multiple contexts, no prior study has investigated the association between the practices of standalone sustainability reporting and the disclosure of SDG information. From the above discussion, the current study has an a priori  expectation that the use of standalone reports for sustainability disclosure by firms worldwide will positively affect their SDG disclosure. Formally, we propose the following hypothesis:H4 The use of standalone sustainability reporting by firms positively influences the level of SDG disclosure .     3.2 Impact of SDG disclosure on firm value (RQ-2) Scholars have argued that, in today's competitive market, decision makers need to continuously embrace the external environment, the community and the natural environment in which they operate (Porter and Kramer, 2011 ; de Villiers and Marques, 2016 ; Gao et al., 2016 ). The underlying reason is that firms' future strategic positioning is shaped through changes in their external environment, with firms needing to regularly revisit their strategic priorities to ensure their long-term survival (Porter and Kramer, 2011 ). In the light of stakeholder theory, it is argued that when firms accommodate demands from stakeholders and disclose sustainability information, this provides benefits for fund providers in many ways. For example, firm-level sustainability initiatives would boost firms' market performance due to increased investors and other market players' confidence, as well as reducing information asymmetry (de Villiers and Marques, 2016 ; Gao et al., 2016 ; Khan et al., 2021 ). The underlying theoretical rationale of embracing sustainability issues and related sustainability disclosure and their subsequent impact on a firm's market performance is based on the concept of a ‘win-win’ situation for both parties (Aguinis and Glavas, 2012 ). Specifically, when a profit-seeking firm is voluntarily involved in improving its environmental and social sustainability performance and its disclosure of sustainability information, this signals to the market the firm's openness and transparency to investors as well as caring for broader stakeholder groups (Clarkson et al., 2008 ; Ozkan et al., 2023 ). Scholars have argued that a firm's sustainability disclosure not only reduces market imbalance and improves the firm's market reputation, but also reinforces the ‘social contract’ between the firm and all stakeholders (Deegan, 2013 ; Freeman, 2010 ). Consequently, a firm's sustainability disclosure positively affects the firm's performance. On the specific theme of SDG disclosure, no previous studies have provided evidence on the relationship between SDG disclosure and firms' improved market value. The current study argues that the implementation of the SDGs by a firm and the disclosure of SDG information at the firm level would signal to the market that the firms have clear commitment to a sustainability agenda which is likely to be positively accepted by investors and other market players. So, on top of reducing information asymmetry, disclosure of SDG information would enhance the confidence of investors in the market about a firm's long-term performance. This initiative would indicate that firms are adequately balancing between primary shareholders' interests (e.g., maximising shareholders' returns) and broader stakeholders' demands and expectations (Porter and Kramer, 2011 ). All these initiatives for stakeholders' well-being and protection of the natural environment would be positively appreciated and welcomed by the market. Therefore, if the level of SDG disclosure is increased by firms operating worldwide, it is likely that this disclosure would consequently increase firms' market value. This hypothesis is formally stated as:H5 The level of SDG disclosure is positively associated with firm value .    3.3 Conceptual framework of the study Based on the above discussion and hypotheses, the conceptual framework of the study is depicted in Fig. 1   below.   4 Research method 4.1 Sample and data Our sample consists of all firms covered by the Refinitiv ESG database from 2016 to 2019. Our sample period starts from 2016, as the UN declared the SDGs during 2015, with 2019 being the final year of data collection. Initially, 9586 firm-year observations of SDG data were obtained from the Refinitiv ESG database. However, 2645 firm-year observations were excluded due to the non-availability of firm-level and country-level data. The final sample consists of 6941 firm-year and 6004 firm-year observations for the determinants model and firm value model, respectively, across 30 countries covering the period from 2016 to 2019. Financial data are collected from the Refinitiv Worldscope database and non-financial data from the Refinitiv ESG database. Country-level data are collected from the World Bank database. Our sample is dominated by firms operating in the financial industry (10.49% and 11.53%, respectively), followed by the services industry (9.31% and 8.81%, respectively), while miscellaneous manufacturing industries have the lowest distribution of firms (0.63% and 0.65%, respectively). The study does not report the industry distribution of firms in our sample for reasons of brevity.  4.2 Measure of sustainable development goals (SDGs) The current study's SDG Disclosure Index comprised 17 items set by the United Nations (UN). Appendix A  provides the list of items included in the index. The Refinitiv ESG database collects these 17 items of SDG disclosure data from annual reports and sustainability reports, also providing SDG disclosure-related raw data (Yes/No) without quantifying the data. Using a binary coding scheme, the current study coded each datapoint (‘Yes’ [Y] or ‘No’ [N]) for each SDG indicator available on the database. A score of 1 is assigned if the Refinitiv ESG database is coded ‘Y’ for an item listed in Appendix A , with a score of 0 assigned if it is coded ‘N’. Prior studies in the literature have extensively used this analysis technique (Khan et al., 2021 ).4  4 The study did not use the second coder as the data were collected by the Refinitiv ESG database in the form of Y/N (Yes/No). A score of 1 is assigned if the Refinitiv ESG database is coded ‘Y’ (1) for an SDG item, while a score of 0 is assigned if the Refinitiv ESG database is coded ‘N’ (0) for the absence of an SDG item. The data provided by the database have already had their adequate validity proven.   The SDG Disclosure Index could be quantified by using either a weighted or an unweighted approach (Cooke, 1989 ; Khan et al., 2021 ). In the current study, an unweighted approach is utilised in which each item of the SDGs in the index is deemed to be equally important (Cooke, 1989 ). The overall SDG Disclosure Index (SDG ) score captures the ratio of the aggregate disclosure score to the maximum possible disclosure score (i.e., 17) for each firm-year. In other words, our SDG Disclosure Index (SDG_DISC)  is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the total number of SDG items disclosed by a firm multiplied by 100. A higher SDG  score indicates a higher level of SDG disclosure. The study uses Cronbach's alpha coefficient values to assess the SDG Disclosure Index's internal consistency, following prior studies (e.g., Gul and Leung, 2004 ), with the value of 0.962 (unreported in this paper) indicating that the items in SDG_DISC  capture the same underlying constructs. Furthermore, we find that only 11.15% of firm-year observations in the Refinitiv ESG database are coded ‘Y’ (i.e., these firm-year observations disclosed SDG information) while the remainder are coded ‘N’ (i.e., these firm-year observations did not disclose SDG information). As the data are collected by the Refinitiv ESG consultants, the study's reliability is assured as these data are publicly available and have been well trusted by different stakeholders, including investors, financial analysts and firms across the world.  4.3 Measures of independent variables and other variables of interest In the current study, environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance is measured as the average of the ESG performance scores reported by the Refinitiv ESG database. Environmental performance (ENV_PERF)  is measured as the weighted average relative rating of a firm covering three environmental category scores: resource use, environmental emissions reduction and innovation (Refinitiv, 2020 ). Furthermore, social performance (SOC_PERF)  is measured as the weighted average relative rating of a firm covering four social category scores: workforce, human rights, community and product responsibility (Refinitiv, 2020 ). Governance performance (GOV_PERF)  is measured as the weighted average relative rating of a firm based on the reported governance information and the resulting three governance category scores: management, shareholders and CSR strategy (Refinitiv, 2020 ). The ESG performance score ranges from 0 to 100, with a higher value indicating a higher level of ESG performance. We measure stakeholder engagement (STAKEHOLDER)  as an indicator variable that takes a value of 1 if the firm has active stakeholder engagement programs, and 0 otherwise. The presence of a sustainability committee (SUST_COM)  is measured as an indicator variable that equals 1 if a firm has a sustainability committee, and 0 otherwise. Finally, we measure standalone sustainability reporting (SUST_REPORT)  as an indicator variable that equals 1 if the firm issues separate CSR/sustainability reports, and 0 otherwise.  4.4 Empirical models: determinants of SDG disclosure We employ the following model to test the hypotheses H1 –H4 :(1) SDG_DISC i,t  = β 0  + β 1  ESG_PERF i,t  + β 2  STAKEHOLDER i,t  + β 3  SUSTCOM + β 4  SUST_REPORT i,t  + β 5  SIZE i,t  + β 6  ROA i,t  + β 7  LEV i,t  + β 8  GOP i,t  + β 9  EXTFIN i,t  + β 10  INSTOWN i,t  + β 11  SUST_REG j,t  + β 12  CSDG j,t  + β 13  CSTAKE j,t  + β 14  LEGAL j,t  + β 15  LNGDP j,t  + ∑YEAR i,t  + ∑INDUSTRY i,t  + ε i,t     where subscript i  denotes the individual firm; j  equals the country; t  equals the time period. SDG_DISC  is the percentage of firm-level SDG disclosure. Our variables of interest in Equation (1)  are ESG performance (ESG_PERF) ; stakeholder engagement (STAKEHOLDER) ; presence of a sustainability committee (SUSTCOM) ; and issuance of a standalone sustainability report (SUST_REPORT) . Appendix B  provides the definitions of all variables. Following prior studies on sustainability disclosure (Clarkson et al., 2008 ; Dhaliwal et al., 2011 ), several control variables are included in Equation (1) . We control for firm size as larger firms are more visible and attract greater scrutiny of their disclosure of sustainability information (de Villiers and Marques, 2016 ; Haque, 2017 ) from the public and government. Therefore, we control for firm size (SIZE)  which is expected to have a positive effect on SDG disclosure. Firms that are highly profitable (ROA)  have a higher level of financial resources for engaging in social activities and conducting the corresponding disclosure (Dhaliwal et al., 2014 ; Haque, 2017 ). Our study expects ROA  to have a positive effect on SDG disclosure. Furthermore, debt holders are more interested in SDG disclosure due to its capability to reveal the downside risk (Dhaliwal et al., 2014 ). Therefore, we control for the leverage ratio (LEV) . The study also controls for growth opportunities (GOP)  as firms have limited financial resources for sustainability activities and disclosure when in an expansionary period (Dhaliwal et al., 2011 ). Firms that raise debt or equity financing have a higher propensity to disclose voluntary information to lower their cost of capital (Clarkson et al., 2008 ). Thus, we control for external financing (EXTFIN)  which is expected to have a positive effect on SDG disclosure. Our study controls for institutional investor ownership (INSTOWN)  as firms with a higher level of institutional investors are expected to push for the disclosure of SDG performance and sustainability information. We expect that INSTOWN  will have a positive effect on SDG disclosure. We also control for country-level sustainable regulation stringency (SUST_REG) , as well as SDG performance (CSDG) ; stakeholder orientation (CSTAKE) ; legal environment (LEGAL) ; and financial development (LNGDP)  at the country level to capture their effects on firm-level SDG disclosure.  4.5 Empirical models: consequences of SDG disclosure We employ the following model to test H5 :(2) TOBINQ i,t+1  = β 0  + β 1  SDG_DISC i,t  + β 2  SIZE i,t  + β 3  ROA i,t  + β 4  LEV i,t  + β 5  LIQUID i,t  + β 6  VOLAT i,t  + β 7  ESG_PERF i,t  + β 8  SUST_REG j,t  + β 9  CSDG j,t  + β 10  CSTAKE j,t  + β 11  LEGAL j,t  + β 12  LNGDP j,t  + ∑YEAR i,t  + ∑INDUSTRY i,t  + ε i,t     where TOBINQ  is measured as the book value of total assets plus the market value of equity minus the book value of equity divided by total assets. We use TOBINQ  as a measure of firm value as it reflects a firm's forward-looking performance, signalling the firm's future growth prospects and sustainability of profits or its expected future performance (Cahan et al., 2016 ; Luo and Bhattacharya, 2006 ). Moreover, as share price is considered the key input in the computation of TOBINQ , changes in share prices reflect investor reactions to the SDGs, with SDG_DISC  being SDG disclosure. We include several control variables in our research models due to their association with Tobin's Q, based on prior research. Firms that are larger in size are more likely to enjoy economies of scale which may result in improved firm value (Wang and Qian, 2011 ). We therefore control for firm size (SIZE) . We include profitability (PROFIT)  to control for investment opportunity. Firms with higher profitability are more likely to have a favourable investment opportunity that can contribute to their higher level of financial performance (Roll et al., 2009 ). On the other hand, higher profitability may also indicate the firm's maturity which may contribute to limited growth opportunities (Roll et al., 2009 ). Furthermore, we include leverage (LEV)  and return volatility (VOLAT)  to capture the various dimensions of firm risk that may influence firm value. For example, leverage (LEV)  affects financial performance through the monitoring activities of debt holders (Roll et al., 2009 ), while return volatility affects firm performance through increasing market risk. We also control for firm-level ESG performance (ESG_PERF)  as prior studies have reported that firms with a higher level of ESG performance have a higher firm value (Deng et al., 2013 ). In Equation (2) , several country-level control variables are included. We include the stringency of sustainability regulation (SUST_REG)  as firms in countries with greater stringency in sustainability regulations provide more sustainability-related disclosures (Maso et al., 2020 ) that affect firm value. Furthermore, we control for country-level SDG performance (CSDG) , country-level stakeholder orientation (CSTAKE)  and country-level legal environment (LEGAL)  as firms in these countries are more likely to provide more sustainability-related disclosures that may affect firm value. Moreover, we control for country-level gross domestic product (GDP) to control for the financial development of a country, with this measured as the natural logarithm of gross domestic product (GDP) (LNGDP) . We also control for year and industry in Equation (2)  to control for year and industry effects in our study's findings.  4.6 Estimation method The study's data comprise panel time-series data, enabling the estimation of the model using various approaches, such as pooled ordinary least squares (OLS), fixed effects and random effects. To determine the most suitable regression model for the analysis, we employ Hausman's (1978)  test to select a preferred regression model for the analysis. The test results provide support for utilising a regression model with random effects for year and industry, emphasising their importance in the analysis. Furthermore , we conduct the Breusch–Pagan Lagrange Multiplier (LM ) test to determine between random effects or OLS regression in selecting the model, with the test results supporting OLS regression. We also test validity for year and industry fixed effects, with the F -test results supporting year and industry fixed effects. Therefore, we estimate the pooled OLS model with year and industry fixed effects. Furthermore, we employ robust standard errors clustered at the firm level to control for heteroscedasticity and serial correlation issues in our study's regression models. Additionally, variance inflation factor (VIF) values are used to check for potential multicollinearity.   5 Empirical results 5.1 Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis Table 2  presents the descriptive statistics of the dependent and independent variables. The mean SDG disclosure (SDG_DISC)  is 0.042, indicating that firms in the study's sample disclose approximately 4.20% of SDG disclosure items, as shown in Table 1   . The mean (median) of ESG performance (ESG_PERF)  is 0.478 (0.474), while the means (medians) of the individual dimensions of ESG performance, namely, environmental performance (ENV_PERF) , social performance (SOC_PERF)  and governance performance (GOV_PERF)  are 0.382 (0.363), 0.514 (0.505) and 0.505 (0.515), respectively. Approximately 48.40% of firms in the study's sample have an active stakeholder engagement program (STAKEHOLDER) , while about 53.90% of firms in the study's sample have a sustainability committee and 62.60% of firms in the study's sample issue standalone sustainability reports (SUST_REPORT) . The average (median) size (SIZE)  of firms, measured as the natural logarithm of market capitalization, in the current study's sample is 7.990 (7.942), implying that, on average, firms in the study's sample have US$11,371 million (unreported in this paper) in market capitalisation. The average profitability (ROA)  and leverage ratio (LEV)  are about 2.10% and 26.70% of total assets, respectively. The mean value of growth opportunities (MB)  is 1.970. The average firm has positive financing of 0.045, suggesting that the average firm raises more financing rather than reducing debt or repurchasing shares. The average institutional investor ownership (INSTOWN)  is 42.10%. Regarding other country-level variables, the mean country-level sustainable development goals (CSDG)  is 30.774, while the average of the country-level legal environment (LEGAL)  is 20.416 and the average of the natural logarithm of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (LNGDP)  is 10.644. About 64.70% of firms in the current study's sample are domiciled in stakeholder-oriented countries (CSTAKE) . Table 2  presents the country-level descriptive statistics. Our sample is dominated by firms operating in the United States (US) (37.93%), followed by those in the United Kingdom (UK) (7.64%) and Japan (6.92%), while Portugal has the lowest number of firms (0.26%). About 95.03% of South African firms have a stakeholder engagement program, followed by Malaysia (93.97%) and Thailand (93.46%). All South African firms (100%) in the study's sample have a sustainability committee, while the US has the lowest number of firms (27.16%) with a sustainability committee. Moreover, all firms from Austria and Portugal in our sample issued standalone sustainability reports, a practice much less common amoung US firms (29.40%). Table 3   presents Pearson's correlation matrix in which SDG_DISC  is positively correlated with ESG performance (r  = 0.232); stakeholder engagement (r  = 0.216); presence of a sustainability committee (r  = 0.176); and issuance of a standalone sustainability report (r  = 0.202). All these coefficients are significant at the 1% level of significance. Gujarati and Porter (2009)  suggested that correlations with a value of less than 0.80 do not create multicollinearity problems, with none of the study's correlation coefficient values exceeding 0.80 (as shown in Table 3 ). We do not provide the correlation matrix for the firm value model in this paper for reasons of brevity. However, the unreported results suggest that all correlation coefficients are within the threshold suggested by Gujarati and Porter (2009) . In addition, the mean variance inflation factor (VIF) value of the variables is 2.43, while the minimum VIF value is 1.07 and the maximum VIF value is 5.91. A VIF value higher than 10 is considered to be leading to potential multicollinearity concerns (Gujarati and Porter, 2009 ). Based on these results, the current study's findings are unlikely to suffer from multicollinearity problems.  5.2 Regression results 5.2.1 Determinants of SDG disclosure Table 4   reports the regression results for this study's hypotheses. Columns (1)–(4) present the regression results for each determinant individually that estimate the SDG disclosures, while Column (5) shows the regression results for all determinants together. The R 2  ( adjusted-R 2  )  values for the models vary from 18.10% (17.70%) to 20.30% (19.80%). The coefficient of ESG_PERF  is positive and statistically significant (β  = 0.161, p  < 0.01) in Column (1), suggesting that firms with superior ESG performance provide a higher level of SDG disclosure. Similarly, the coefficient of STAKEHOLDER  is positive and statistically significant (β  = 0.050, p  < 0.01) as shown in Column (2), suggesting that firms with enhanced stakeholder engagement provide a higher level of SDG disclosure. These findings are aligned with previous study by Chen et al. (2022) . Likewise, the coefficient of SUSTCOM  is statistically significant in Column (3). This result suggests that the presence of a sustainability committee in firms is associated with increased SDG disclosure. This is consistent with prior studies (Pizzi et al., 2021 ; Subramaniam et al., 2023 ). Lastly, the coefficient of SUST_REPORT  in Column (4) is positive and statistically significant (β  = 0.058, p  < 0.01), suggesting that firms that issue standalone sustainability reports provide a higher level of SDG disclosure. Moreover, when considering all four determinants of SDG disclosure simultaneously in Column (5), we observe that while the coefficients for ESG_PERF , STAKEHOLDER , and SUST_REPORT  retain their respective signs and levels of significance, the coefficient on SUSTCOM  becomes statistically insignificant. Perhaps the role of sustainability committee is less important in the present of other factors that determine SDG disclosures. Therefore, our hypotheses H1 , H2 , and H4  are supported, but not H3 . Overall, our findings underscore the significance of ESG performance, stakeholder engagement, and the issuance of sustainability reports as important determinants of SDG disclosure. Regarding the control variables, we find that firms of larger size (SIZE)  and greater leverage (LEV)  provide a higher level of SDG disclosure. In relation to country-level variables, we find that firms domiciled in countries with stringent sustainability regulations and in shareholder-oriented countries (CSTAKE)  provide a higher level of SDG disclosure. No other country-level factors are found to have a statistically significant influence on firm-level SDG disclosure. The probable reason is that when firm-level factors drive the level of SDG disclosure, the importance of country-level factors is reduced.  5.2.2 Consequences of SDG disclosure Table 5   reports the regression results of the association between SDG disclosure and firm value. Model (1) presents the regression results with only the control variables, whereas Model (2) shows the full regression model. The coefficient of SDG_DISC  is positive and statistically significant (β  = 0.108, p  < 0.01) in Model (2), suggesting that firms with a higher level of SDG disclosure have higher firm value. In terms of economic significance, the estimated coefficient suggests that an increase of one standard deviation in SDG_DISC  is associated with a 1.69% increase in the TOBINQ .5  5 The standard deviation of SDG_DISC  is 0.156. The study computes 1.69% as [0.108 × 0.156) × 100.   In Table 5 , Model (2), the R 2   value is 0.257, suggesting that the independent variables collectively capture 25.70% of the variation in firm value. To assess the incremental contribution of SDG disclosure to the explanatory power of our regression analysis, the study follows Gujarati (2003) , repeating our regression analysis in Table 6   after excluding the main test variable SDG_DISC . The results from this regression show that the explanatory power decreases to 25%, as reported in Table 5 , Model (1). The F -statistic is then computed, as demonstrated by Gujarati (2003) , using the R 2   statistics reported for the regressions with and without SDG_DISC  to test the null hypothesis that the inclusion of SDG_DISC  as an explanatory variable does not affect the explanatory power (R 2 ) of our regression model. Gujarati (2003) F -statistic, reported at the bottom of Table 6  in Model (2), is 53.71 and is significant at the 1%, level suggesting that SDG_DISC  significantly increases the explanatory power of the regression models. Overall, the study finds that SDG disclosure is incrementally informative. Regarding the control variables, the coefficients of SIZE, ROA  and ESG_PERF  are positive and statistically significant, suggesting that larger firms, firms with greater profitability and firms with higher ESG performance have a higher level of SDG disclosure. On the other hand, the coefficients of LEV  and LIQUID  are negative and statistically significant, suggesting that firms with higher leverage and higher liquidity have lower firm value. Although the significant relationships between these control variables and TOBINQ  are generally in line with our expectations, the study documents a negative association between LIQUID  and TOBINQ  which is interpreted as being due to larger firms may have relatively higher agency costs that cannot be effectively minimised in comparison to those of smaller firms (Claessens et al., 2002 ). Regarding country-level variables, the study finds that firms in countries with a stakeholder orientation and in countries with a higher level of gross domestic product (GDP) have a higher firm value, while firms in countries with a stronger legal environment have a lower firm value.    6 Additional analyses and robustness checks 6.1 Determinants of SDG disclosure Several additional analyses are run to check the robustness of the study's findings. Firstly, any omitted variables that are correlated with the study's variables of interest (ESG_PERF , STAKEHOLDER, SUSTCOM  and SUST_REPORT ) would result in an endogeneity problem in our research models. Although several country-level factors are included in Equation (1) , our findings may be affected by firm-level and country-level omitted variable bias. Therefore, the study runs a model including firm fixed effects and country fixed effects. The potential benefit of including firm fixed effects and country fixed effects is that they remove the omitted time-invariant firm and country characteristics that could potentially cause a spurious correlation (Kim et al., 2020 ) between SDG disclosure and the study's variables of interest (ESG_PERF , STAKEHOLDER, SUSTCOM  and SUST_REPORT ). Table 6 , Panels A and B present the regression results. The study's findings are qualitatively similar to these results using both firm and country fixed effects. Secondly, our findings of the association between SDG disclosure and the variables of interest (ESG_PERF , STAKEHOLDER, SUSTCOM  and SUST_REPORT ) could be biased due to endogeneity arises from reverse causality. To address endogeneity concerns, the study employs Hausman (1978)  specification test for endogeneity with instrumental variable (IV) techniques. The results are not reported in this paper for reasons of brevity. However, the results [F  = 0.01; p  = 0.938 for ESG_PERF ; F  = 0.48; p  = 0.488 for STAKEHOLDER ; F  = 0.25; p  = 0.618 for SUSTCOM ; and F  = 2.09; p  = 0.149 for SUST_REPORT]  suggest that it is very unlikely that endogeneity influences our findings. Thirdly, to address the potential endogeneity and self-selection issues, the lead–lag approach is applied to evaluate the robustness of the findings where our dependent variable leads in one period. The unreported results show that the study's main findings remain the same. Fourthly, other firm-specific control variables (i.e., revenue growth, research and development [R&D], capital expenditure, asset newness, operating cash flow, foreign operations and stock return volatility) are added to Equation (1) . The unreported results show that our study's findings remain qualitatively similar, as reported in Table 4 . Fifthly, the unscaled SDG scores to measure SDG disclosure as a dependent variable are employed in Equation (1) . Table 6 , Panel C presents the regression results. The results show that our findings remain qualitatively similar.  6.2 Heckman's (1979)  two-stage analysis The study finds that firms with a higher level of SDG disclosure have higher firm value. However, our findings may be affected by self-selection bias as firms voluntarily provide SDG information. To address potential self-selection bias, we apply Heckman (1979)  two-stage model. In the first stage of Heckman (1979)  model, a model is developed for a firm's decision to disclose SDG information. More specifically, the following probit regression model is developed:(3) Pr(SDG_DUM=1) i,t  = β 0  + β 1  PROPDISC i,t  + β 2  ESG_PERF i,t  + β 3  STAKEHOLDER i,t  + β 4  SUSTCOM i,t  + β 5  SUST_REPORT i,t  + β 6  SIZE i,t  + β 7  ROA i,t  + β 8  LEV i,t  + β 9  GOP i,t  + β 10  EXTFIN i,t  + β 11  INSTOWN i,t  + β 12  SUST_REG j,t  + β 13  CSDG j,t  + β 14  CSTAKE j,t  + β 15  LEGAL j,t  + β 16  LNGDP j,t  + ∑Year i,t  + ∑Industry i,t  + ε i,t     In Equation (3) , SDG_DUM  is the dependent variable which is measured as an indicator variable that is coded 1 if the firm discloses SDG information, and 0 otherwise. Several variables are included in Equation (3)  based on Equation (1) . Furthermore, PROPDISC  is included in the first-stage model as shown in Equation (3)  to satisfy the exclusion restriction criteria that capture industry pressure. If more firms in a given industry disclose their SDG information, then non-disclosing firms are under greater pressure to disclose this information to minimise the negative perceptions of external capital providers. PROPDISC  is measured as the proportion of firms in an industry that disclose SDG information. Appendix B  provides the definitions of all variables. The inverse Mills ratio (IMR ) is generated from Equation (7) and is used as a control variable in Equations (4)–(6) to account for self-selection bias. Table 7  , Panel A presents the first-stage regression results. Consistent with our expectation, the coefficient of PROPDISC  is positive and statistically significant (β  = 4.340, p  < 0.01). The model has a pseudo-R 2    value of 55% and a partial R 2   value (un-tabulated) of 13.17% for PROPDISC  which is statistically significant at the 1% level, suggesting that PROPDISC  is a reasonable exogenous variable to satisfy the exclusion restriction criteria. Table 7 , Panel B reports the second-stage regression results. The coefficient of SDG_DISC  is positive and statistically significant (β  = 0.082, p  < 0.01) in Model (1). Furthermore, the coefficient of the inverse Mills ratio (IMR ) is statistically insignificant, suggesting that self-selection bias is not a significant concern.6  6 The potential reason for an insignificant inverse Mills ratio (IMR ) is further investigated using the VIF value. The unreported value of VIF for IMR  is 1.87, indicating that multicollinearity is not an issue for an insignificant IMR  coefficient.    6.3 Entropy balancing analysis A firm's decision to disclose SDG information depends on its perception of the associated costs and benefits, with this also partly determined by the firm's characteristics. Therefore, it is possibly the firm's characteristics that determine firm value and not SDG information disclosure. To address this specific endogeneity concern, firms in our study's sample are randomised by applying the entropy balancing method. This technique mitigates the effects of imbalances in firm characteristics, thereby reducing the likelihood that our results would relate to these imbalances rather than to SDG information disclosure. The study splits firm-year observations into a treatment group (HIGH_SDG=1)  and a control group (HIGH_SDG=0) , based on the industry's median firm-level SDG score. Table 8   presents the entropy balancing results, assigning weights to adjust for the sample's distribution of control observations (Hainmueller and Xu, 2013 ). This adjustment reweights each control group observation in the control group to balance the mean, variance and skewness of all covariates between treatment and control groups. More weight is assigned to under-represented observations and less weight to over-represented observations, with the resultant ‘pseudo’ control group mitigating the risk of design choices affecting our findings. Table 8 , Panel A presents the descriptive statistics for the entropy-balanced samples when balancing HIGH_SDG=1  versus HIGH_SDG=0  for treatment and control groups, respectively. Panel B presents the second-stage regression results generated by estimating Equation (1)  on the entropy-balanced samples. As the coefficient of SDG_DISC  is positive and statistically significant at the 1% level, these findings confirm that the positive association between SDG disclosure and firm value is not driven by imbalances in firm characteristics.  6.4 Unexplained component of SDG disclosure and firm value This study addresses the question of whether SDG disclosure enhances firm value by: (i) building a prediction model for SDG disclosure; and (ii) examining the association between the unexplained component of SDG disclosure and a firm's value, following prior studies (e.g., Gul and Leung, 2004 ; Lys et al., 2015 ). The underlying reason is that predicted SDG disclosure is a linear combination of firm characteristics. If most of the variations in a firm's SDG disclosure are also explained by the firm's characteristics used to predict SDG disclosure, then SDG disclosure simply works as an aggregate proxy for the characteristics of the firm (Gul and Leung, 2004 ). Conversely, if most of the variations in a firm's value are explained by the unexplained component of SDG disclosure, the firm's value is more likely to be causally linked to SDG disclosure, with the residuals considered to be exogenous as they are not determined by firm-specific factors (Gul and Leung, 2004 ). For the SDG disclosure prediction model, Equation (1)  is used. The residual, ε , from the first-stage model, which is the unexplained component of SDG disclosure (SDG_RESID ), is used as the independent variable in the second-stage regression model. Table 9   reports the regression results. The results are consistent with our prediction; that is, the coefficient of SDG_RESID  is positive and statistically significant in Model (1). In summary, the results are consistent with our main findings reported in Table 6 , indicating that our results are robust.  6.5 Do country-level institutional factors affect the association between SDG disclosure and firm value? Prior studies have shown that firm-level non-financial disclosure is influenced by country-level institutional factors (Dhaliwal et al., 2012 ; Simnett et al., 2009 ). Thus, the current study examines the moderating role of three country-level factors (i.e., country-level business culture, economic development, and governance) on the association between SDG disclosure and firm value. Prior studies highlight that stakeholder-oriented business cultures prioritise diverse stakeholder demands and interests, acknowledging the legitimate stake society has in corporate activities (Bose et al., 2023 ; Simnett et al., 2009 ; Smith et al., 2005 ). By contrast, shareholder-oriented cultures view firms primarily as vehicles for generating shareholder value, thus diminishing the influence of other stakeholders (Bose et al., 2023 ; Simnett et al., 2009 ). Following prior studies (Bose et al., 2023 ), CSTAKE  is measured as an indicator variable that takes a value of 1 if a country is domiciled in a code law country, and 0 otherwise. Table 10  , Model (1) reports the regression results.7  7 The key variable of interest in Model (1) is the interaction between SDG_DISC  and STAKE (SDG_DISC×STAKE) . The interaction term captures the difference in the effects of SDG disclosure on firm value between firms in countries with stakeholder-oriented versus shareholder-oriented business cultures. The coefficient of SDG_DISC  captures the effects of SDG disclosures on firm value for firms in countries with a shareholder-oriented business culture, whereas the sum of the coefficient of SDG_DISC  and that of the interaction term hence captures the effect of SDG disclosure on firm value for firms in countries with stakeholder-oriented business culture.   The coefficient of SDG×CSTAKE  in Model (1) is positive and statistically significant, suggesting that, after controlling for other factors, the average increase in firm value led by SDG disclosures is higher for firms in countries with stakeholder-oriented business culture. This is further confirmed by the test of the linear combination of the coefficients of SDG_DISC  and SDG_DISC×CSTAKE  [F  = 5.86, p  < 0.01 in Model (1)]. By contrast, we find that the coefficient on SDG_DISC  is statistically insignificant in Model (1), suggesting that firms in countries with a shareholder-oriented business culture do not enjoy any value-enhancing benefits from SDG disclosures. Overall, our findings suggest that a country-level stakeholder-oriented business culture positively moderates the positive association between SDG disclosure and firm value. Furthermore, the study examines the role of country-level economic development in the association between SDG disclosure and firm value. The growth of SDG disclosure can be influenced by the economic development of a firm's home country. Developed countries with higher economic prosperity have greater institutional capacity to embrace non-financial reporting, such as CSR and the sustainable development agenda, with the opposite applying to developing countries (Busco et al., 2019 ; Husted, 2005 ; Rosati and Faria, 2019a ). Developed countries also have more resources available for sustainability and SDG disclosure initiatives and may prioritise embracing the SDGs to demonstrate leadership globally (Baughn et al., 2007 ; Busco et al., 2019 ). By contrast, developing countries with poor economic growth may face challenges in adopting the SDGs due to competing priorities. Overall, it is expected that firms in developed countries will have a higher level of SDG disclosure compared to firms in developing countries. Following prior studies (Bose et al., 2021 ), the current study measures HIGH_EDEV  as an indicator variable that takes a value of 1 if the value of the GDP of a country is greater than the sample's median value, and 0 otherwise. Table 10 , Model (2) reports the regression results.8  8 The key variable of interest in Model (2) is the interaction between SDG_DISC  and HIGH_EDEV (SDG_DISC×HIGH_EDEV) . The interaction term captures the difference in the effects of SDG disclosure on firm value between firms in countries with higher versus lower economic development. The coefficient of SDG_DISC  captures the effects of SDG disclosures on firm value for firms in countries with a lower economic development, whereas the sum of the coefficient of SDG_DISC  and that of the interaction term hence captures the effect of SDG disclosure on firm value for firms in countries with a higher economic development.   The coefficient of SDG×HIGH_EDEV  in Model (2) is positive and statistically significant, suggesting that, after controlling for other factors, the average increase in firm value led by SDG disclosures is higher for firms in countries with higher economic development. This is further confirmed by the test of the linear combination of the coefficients of SDG_DISC  and SDG_DISC×HIGH_EDEV  [F  = 4.89, p  < 0.01 in Model (2)]. By contrast, we find that the coefficient on SDG_DISC  is statistically insignificant in Model (2), suggesting that firms in countries with a lower economic development do not enjoy any value-enhancing benefits from SDG disclosures. Overall, our findings suggest that country-level economic development positively moderates the positive association between SDG disclosure and firm value. Moreover, prior studies have suggested that countries with high-quality governance are likely to have stringent environmental regulations, greater transparency, and stronger enforcement mechanisms through which a firm's non-financial disclosures are prioritised (Bose et al., 2021 ; Ding et al., 2021 ). As a result, investors in these countries may reward firms with a higher level of SDG disclosure, leading to higher firm value. On the other hand, in countries with low-quality governance, compliance with SDG disclosure may not be widespread (Mateo-Márquez et al., 2022 ). Following prior studies (Bose et al., 2021 ), HIGH_GOV  is measured as an indicator variable that takes a value of 1 if the value of the country-level governance score is greater than the sample's median score, and 0 otherwise. Our study computes the country-level governance score as the sum of the following six governance indicators reported by the World Bank: voice and accountability; regulatory quality; political stability and absence of violence/terrorism; rule of law; government effectiveness; and control of corruption. Table 10 , Column (3) reports the regression results.9  9 The key variable of interest in Model (3) is the interaction between SDG_DISC  and HIGH_GOV (SDG_DISC×HIGH_GOV) . The interaction term captures the difference in the effects of SDG disclosure on firm value between firms in countries with higher versus lower governance. The coefficient of SDG_DISC  captures the effects of SDG disclosures on firm value for firms in countries with a lower governance, whereas the sum of the coefficient of SDG_DISC  and that of the interaction term hence captures the effect of SDG disclosure on firm value for firms in countries with a higher governance.   The coefficient of SDG×HIGH_GOV  in Model (3) is positive and statistically significant, suggesting that, after controlling for other factors, the average increase in firm value led by SDG disclosures is higher for firms in countries with higher economic development. This is further confirmed by the test of the linear combination of the coefficients of SDG_DISC  and SDG_DISC×HIGH_GOV  [F  = 32.04, p  < 0.01 in Model (3)]. We also find that the coefficient on SDG_DISC  is statistically significant in Model (3), suggesting that firms in countries with a lower governance also enjoy value-enhancing benefits from SDG disclosures. Overall, our findings suggest that country-level governance quality positively moderates the positive association between SDG disclosure and firm value.  6.6 Other tests Furthermore, Equation (2)  is re-run with the addition of country fixed effects to test the robustness of our study's findings. The results are not reported in this paper for reasons of brevity. However, the unreported results suggest that country fixed effects do not change the tenor of our findings. Furthermore, to ensure that the findings are not driven by firms in any specific country, Equations (1) and (2)  are run after excluding each of the following groups, one at a time: (1) US firms; (2) UK firms; (3) Japanese firms; (4) Australian firms; and (5) countries with less than 20, 30, 50 and 100 firm-year observations. The (unreported) results of each analysis remain qualitatively similar to our study's main findings.   7 Conclusion, implications, and limitations This study explores the determinants and consequences of SDG disclosure using the cross-country context. The study finds that environmental, social and governance [ESG] performance, stakeholder engagement, and issuance of standalone sustainability reports are major determinants that drive firm-level SDG disclosure. The study also finds that firm-level SDG disclosure positively affects firms’ market value. 7.1 Academic implications of the findings Our study's findings make at least three key contributions to the limited SDG disclosure research in the existing sustainability literature. Firstly, our study responds to calls for further research on the SDGs (e.g., Hummel and Szekely, 2022 ; van der Waal and Thijssens, 2020 ) to add to the empirical understanding of this topical issue and to contribute to the SDG literature using a large sample. Secondly, to the best of our knowledge, this study is one of the first to examine the determinants of SDG disclosure using the UN's 17 SDG items. Prior studies have mainly examined the determinants of SDG disclosure using the frequency of the keyword “SDG” in sustainability reports as a measure of SDG disclosure (e.g., García-Sánchez et al., 2020 ; Rosati and Faria, 2019a ; Rosati and Faria, 2019b ). Although Hummel and Szekely (2022)  examined the determinants of SDG disclosure in 15 European countries, our study examines both the determinants and consequences in 30 countries across the world, thus complementing the study by Hummel and Szekely (2022) . By providing empirical evidence relating to key firm-level determinants influencing SDG disclosure, the current study increases the understanding of the significance of these firm-level factors that contribute to SDG-related disclosure. Thirdly, our study contributes to the existing literature by providing evidence that a firm's commitment to the SDGs and its associated SDG disclosure enhances shareholders' value. Therefore, the current study provides validation that shareholders' money is used effectively and appropriately when allocated to SDG implementation and disclosure efforts. This line of investigation has rarely been documented empirically in the emerging SDG literature. By providing evidence that capital market players positively welcome firms' SDG disclosure efforts, the study confirms that SDG disclosure is beneficial for increasing shareholders' value in the capital market.  7.2 Practical implications of the findings Our study's findings also have practical implications for various stakeholders discussed in the following sub-sections. 7.2.1 Regulators, policy makers and other external stakeholders The findings have several practical implications for regulators, policy makers and other external stakeholders. Firstly, given the importance of the sustainability theme, the various identified firm-level factors (ESG performance and corporate governance elements) are relevant for SDG disclosure by firms operating worldwide. Consequently, policy makers and national regulators in different countries should encourage firms to embrace these factors as essential steps towards incorporating sustainable development and SDG disclosure. Similarly, the current study's findings can assist national regulators and policy makers to develop national-level policies (and/or stock market listing policies) to improve the reporting of SDG information. Other external stakeholders can also benefit from our study's findings. Through the findings, external stakeholders can gain a clear understanding of how and whether the level of stakeholder engagement in different contexts and the degree of engagement prompt (or obstruct) adoption of the SDGs, as promoted by United Nations [UN] (2021). Based on our findings, stakeholder groups in different contexts are not only able to negotiate for SDG implementation and related disclosure, but they can also work with firms' decision makers. This work ranges from setting priorities through to capacity building and includes resource allocation for SDG projects as well as undertaking joint initiatives, such as the implementation of standalone sustainability reports. Additionally, stakeholder groups (e.g., institutional investors, etc.) can monitor whether standalone sustainability report is (or is not) functional in different contexts. Lastly, the UN, in association with its national-level development partners (i.e., governments and other regulatory bodies) in different countries should promote the economic benefits of SDG implementation (originating from the stock market) to different stakeholders. The UN should also encourage firms to adopt SDG disclosure in order to receive a positive pay-off from the market resulting from the SDGs being embraced worldwide.  7.2.2 Managers and other business professionals Our study's findings have a key message for decision makers of private sector firms that operate globally. For managers who, to date, remain in doubt about committing resources to SDG implementation, the findings' key message is the benefits are available to firms for the implementation of the SDGs and the disclosure of their firms' SDG performance. The markets positively rewards firms for their SDG endeavours. Given that, in most firms, changes are initiated from the top, firms' decision makers must align their resources (e.g., financial, workforce, etc.) to establish a solid business culture with a common set of their firms' sustainable development goals to achieve effective long-term outcomes. Firms that embed the SDGs into their working culture, improve their stakeholders engagement, improve standalone sustainability reports, and above all, report their SDG initiatives have the potential to receive rewards and incentives from the market which would not otherwise be possible to achieve.  7.2.3 Investors and other fund providers The study's findings imply that market players (investors, etc.) welcome firms' implementation of the SDGs and associated reports, when this implementation is driven by several factors. Therefore, the study's findings would be useful for investors and stockholders in different contexts to assess the actual level of firms' commitment to the SDGs and the endeavours of global firms to undertake SDG implementation and associated initiatives. Many investors and other potential fund providers are interested to know whether firms' commitment to sustainability issues and related reporting commitments add value (return) to their investment portfolio. The current study's findings provide answers to investors and other fund providers who are interested in seeing the long-term value of their invested money, especially through the disclosure of these new types of information on non-financial performance.   7.3 Limitations and future research directions Despite the above-mentioned implications, our study's limitations are acknowledged, and the findings should be interpreted with caution. Firstly, although the study examines some important determinants of SDG disclosure and considers both firm and country fixed effects, other important factors may have been missed. Future research could extend our study by addressing other organisational factors. Secondly, in this study, an understanding of determinants and consequences is gained by employing a positivist research design using archival data. Future studies could examine SDG disclosure using data collected through other approaches, such as case studies, in-depth-interviews, or survey questionnaires. Using qualitative methods, future research could investigate stakeholders' views and understanding of facilitating factors and practical challenges experienced by firms' decision makers when undertaking SDG implementation in different contexts. This issue warrants immense practical value as we see divided and fragmented current world with respect to human rights, inequality, and peace across the globe particularly following post-COVID-19 pandemic. As the SDG literature emerges, future research should also investigate potential mediators/channels through which the initiatives of a firm's decision makers on SDG disclosure could be transformed into improving the firm's value. How SDG issues were addressed during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the post-COVID-19 era can also be a good candidate for future investigation.
