Keywords International strategy  Environmental upgrading  Global value chain  Sustainable development goals  Systematic literature review    1 Introduction Globalization has led to increased international trade and the emerge of complex global value chains. At the same time that global resource use and environmental pressures are increasing (Plank et al., 2018 ). Facing this scenario, companies are challenged to include environmental concerns in their business activities (De Marchi et al., 2013b ). The world environmental issues are not restricted to a country’s borders (Ritvala et al., 2014 ), but the association between global value chains (GVC) and sustainable development is still secondary in academic studies. Since the first essay in the 1990s, GVC researchers have been addressing issues related to economic development promotion and secondarily addressing social and environmental sustainability (Humphrey, 2014 ). Research on environmental implications of global value chains focuses on environmental labels and certifications (Klooster, 2006 ) or fair trade (Taylor, 2005 ). Moreover, while there is a systematic literature review on environmental upgrading in global value chains (Khattak and Pinto, 2018 ) it focuses on the conceptualization of the discussion. In all cases the impacts of the relationship between global value chains and environmental upgrading are not systematically analyzed; they are simply assumed (Bolwig et al., 2010 ; Khattak and Pinto, 2018 ). Against this background, a central question guides this article. How the literature identifies the relationship between company’s integration into the global value chain and environmental upgrading? The purpose is to evaluate if the literature presents a favorable or unfavorable view of the relationship between company’s GVC and environmental upgrading. The article uses the Agenda 2030 proposed by United Nations (UN) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG related to natural resources) as a guide to environmental upgrading and to propose a more in-depth understanding of perspectives addressed by the scholars. A systematic literature review was carried out and 84 articles from Scopus and Web of Science databases published between 2000 and 2018 were analyzed. The overall result presents an unfavorable outlook for environmental upgrading. The main contribution of the article is the debate and research agenda about the economic and environmental benefits of GVC. The economic benefits are clear when it is fact that GVC participation is beneficial for companies not only due to the access to international market but also because it allows companies to learn and innovate as they must meet the product quality, delivery time, process efficiency, environmental, labor and social standards required by chain leaders (Pietrobelli and Rabellotti, 2011 ). On the other side, the present article shows that the environmental benefits are not clear. The results give support to some studies that are not optimistic about environmental upgrading (Nygaard and Bolwig, 2018 ). It means a non-clear production in a GVC perspective. First call the attention to an emerging body of work in environmental upgrading (De Marchi et al., 2013a ; Jeppesen and Hansen, 2004 ). Second, it is an avenue to deepen the debate about how developed, emerging economies and low-income countries can use GVC to achieve sustainable development (Costantini et al., 2017 ; Liu et al., 2018 ). Finally, open the research agenda to studies that promote the intersection of GVCs with the SDGs, in order to think in the environmental reforms (Bush et al., 2015 ) and radical conceptual approaches and practices that challenge the reduced understanding of sustainability (Moore, 2015 ). The article shows managerial and social contributions, too. By bringing together studies that indicate the environment concerns and consequences caused by the fragmentation of production, as a managerial contribution, the study draws the attention of decision makers from local and global companies to the urgent need for measures and actions that effectively reverse the negative environmental result generated by increased industrial worldwide production. As a social contribution, the study seeks to foster the creation of a public policy agenda focused on environmental legislation that regulates the best sustainable development practices, making companies assume their share of responsibility for environmental preservation. The article is structured in the following way. Initially, the theoretical foundation is presented. The following explains the research method used in this review with five subsections: data collection procedures, coding, categorization, validity and reliability, and data analysis. The last section discusses the results and points out the research agenda. Finally, we present the conclusions, highlighting the main findings and contributions.  2 Literature review 2.1 Global value chain The global value chain (GVC) describes the full range of activities, on a global scale, that companies and workers perform, from product conception to end-use and beyond, including activities such as research and development (R&D), design, production, marketing, distribution and end-consumer support (Gereffi and Fernandez-Stark, 2011 ). Production fragmentation has led to increasing levels of specialization and differentiation, with companies in developed countries increasingly focusing on intangible aspects of value creation (product design, branding, marketing, and communication), and companies in developing countries focusing on tangible aspects of value creation and labor-intensive production, as labor costs are generally low in these countries (Gereffi, 2009 ). Leading companies, often multinational corporations, shape how GVCs are structured and organized through value chain governance (Humphrey and Schmitz, 2002 ). Chain leaders decide what will be outsourced, what production activities take place, which companies participate in value chains, and whether upgrading will occur (Kaplinsky and Morris, 2000 ). Additionally, they determine market parameters, contract terms, and private and voluntary sustainability standards (Fessehaie and Morris, 2018 ). Upgrading is the benchmark measure to verify whether participation in these global chains effectively leads to the development of participating companies (Gereffi, 2009 ). Upgrading refers to a process of improving a firm’s ability to move to a more lucrative and/or technologically sophisticated economic niche (Gereffi, 1999 ). The GVC literature classifies upgrading in: (1) Economic Upgrading, consisting of four types: (i) process upgrading, (ii) product upgrading, (iii) functional upgrading, and (iv) chain or intersectoral upgrading (Humphrey and Schmitz, 2002 ); (2) Social Upgrading (Barrientos et al., 2011 ); and (3) Environmental Upgrading (De Marchi et al., 2013a ). The focus of this article is the environmental upgrading.  2.2 Environmental upgrading It is important to understand to what extent GVCs impact both value creation and environmental sustainability (Meng et al., 2018 ). However, this understanding is not clear. Currently, there is a lack of understanding of how decisions affecting sustainability are shaped by GVCs (Alexander, 2018 ). Environmental upgrading definitions found in the literature are summarized in Frame 1  . Environmental upgrading in the value chain should be understood partly as a result of industry and market forces, and partly as a result of the internal resources and competitive strategies (Jeppesen and Hansen, 2004 ). It can be carried out reactively and/or proactively (Poulsen et al., 2018 ). In short, environmental upgrading can lead to net cost reductions due to efficiency increase or energy consumption reduction, or to the addition of net value through the creation of new “environmental qualities”. Environmental upgrading can be limited to process improvement (the use of new materials, technologies and/or system integration), but it can also lead to modern products that incorporate environmental value through brand and positioning strategies or certification to get an eco-label (Poulsen et al., 2016 ). Green industries analysis from a global value chain perspective is still incipient, although some contributions have attempted to provide a conceptual framework including sustainability concerns (Bolwig et al., 2010 ). The continued advancement of GVCs as the mode of production for an increasing number of goods and services has considerably impacted economies and societies in both developed and emerging economies. Although there has been much effort towards change, there is evidence of unresolved human rights dilemmas, environmental issues, and ethical dilemmas in GVC operations (Clarke and Boersma, 2017 ). For companies, GVC participation is not only an important market opportunity but also an opportunity to gain knowledge about global markets, advanced processes and global standards that support upgrading (Pietrobelli and Rabellotti, 2011 ). However, this insertion does not automatically result in environmental sustainability. Forward-looking industrial development policies that deepen the capabilities of domestic enterprises, promote knowledge and technology spillovers, and key sustainability issues are critical (Fessehaie and Morris, 2018 ). It is necessary to evaluate which potential impacts may be linked to specific resource production or extraction systems that are affected by value chain participation and restructuring under specific local agroecological conditions (Riisgaard et al., 2010 ). Social and political pressure to improve the environmental footprint of goods, production and distribution has created new challenges for producers, processors and retailers of goods and services, especially those offered directly to consumers (Dauvergne and Lister, 2013 ). This has led to innovations aimed at reducing environmental footprints, and especially the levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from production and transport – processes the GVC literature frames as “environmental upgrading”, but which, however, still has not been widely theorized (Khattak et al., 2015 ).  2.3 The sustainable development goals In April 1987 was presented the sustainable development concept at the World Conference on Environment and Development (WCED) through the Brundtland Commission’s report “Our Common Future”, which stated, “sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (WCED, 1987 , p. 41). After three decades of the concept of sustainable development being formalized, discussion on the topic is still largely of international and national agendas (Holden et al., 2014 ). To create an agenda that will guarantee worldwide sustainable development, on September 25, 2015, the United Nations (UN) launched a new global plan consisting of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and 169 goals distributed in areas of critical importance to humanity and the planet that seek to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new development agenda that must be implemented by 2030. In setting the world’s sustainable development priorities, the SDG offer a unique opportunity to study multinational corporations’ involvement in diverse and interconnected development challenges (van Zanten and van Tulder, 2018 ). The proposal set by the sustainable development agenda for the planet is “to protect the planet from degradation, including through sustainable consumption and production, sustainably managing its natural resources and taking urgent action on climate change, so that it can support the needs of the present and future generations” (Assembly, 2015 , p. 02). Among the 17 objectives proposed by the UN, the six considered by the authors to be related to environmental issues are shown in Table 1  .  2.4 Combining global value chains, environmental upgrading and sustainable development goals The GVC approach (Gereffi, 1999 , 1994 ) is useful for understanding how traditional industries are transforming to meet the sustainability challenge and the reasons new green industries are formed. GVCs cover the full range of activities required to bring a product or service from conception to delivery to final consumers and final disposal after use (Kaplinsky and Morris, 2000 ). Their role in shaping trade and investment, coupled with the global community’s commitment through the SDGs, have important implications for emerging countries’ green development strategies. Thus, the 2030 UN agenda is firmly framed by the opportunities and challenges of global value chains (Fessehaie and Morris, 2018 ) which account for more than two-thirds of total global trade (Kaplinsky, 2016 ). The more GVCs have become widespread, the greater the concerns about the social and environmental conditions of companies and countries where products are manufactured (Lund-Thomsen and Lindgreen, 2014 ). This, since value chains directly affect the environment by the way how primary production uses and interacts with the local resource base (e.g. biodiversity, soil and water) and indirectly by emissions of toxic substances and greenhouse gases from production, processing, transportation and other activities along the chain (Bolwig et al., 2010 ; Milanez et al., 2019 ). The need to increase inclusive growth and the distribution of earnings leads to a discussion of how the processes driving value chains at the global and regional levels fit into global goals, particularly for smaller, low-income economies. These countries’ domestic markets are limited; consequently, the role played by GVCs will have a strong influence on the outcomes of the SDGs (Kaplinsky, 2016 ). In this sense, in addition to economic opportunities, GVCs can create a pathway for environmentally and socially sustainable growth. One example is the widespread adoption of sustainability standards by leading companies that support the SDG related to fair work, sustainable production and sustainable change. Participation and upgrading in global value chains could have even deeper impacts on the SDGs if the government and private sector set the way towards more inclusive and sustainable paths, especially for small and medium size producers (Fessehaie and Morris, 2018 ).   3 Methodology A systematic literature review was realized based on the procedures proposed by Gaur and Kumar (2018) , which suggests four steps of content analysis: data collection, coding, analysis, and interpretation of coded content. In addition, the steps of categorization and validity and reliability of data were added. Content analysis consists of a set of communication analysis techniques using systematic procedures and objective description of message content (Bardin, 2016 ). It is also a technique that works with the collected data, aiming to identify what is being said about a certain theme (Vergara, 2005 ) so there is a need to decode what is being communicated. 3.1 Data collection In this phase, according to Gaur and Kumar (2018) , the authors’ concern should be to identify relevant, objective-oriented samples and not necessarily to cover the entire population. Based on this, the searches were performed in Scopus and Web of Science (SJR) databases. Scopus was chosen as database of record, as it is most comprehensive database of peer-reviewed journals in the fields of management, organization, and social science (Pisoni et al., 2018 ). Moreover, business and management are among the main publishing fields of Scopus and Web of Science databases (Hossain, 2018 ). After selecting the research bases, the articles for the initial sample were identified. As a time filter, the last 20 years were considered for research because we were interested in the latest studies on the topic, and the period from 2000 to 2018 was obtained. The keywords used for the selection of articles belonged to two major themes: GVC and environmentally sustainable development. In both cases, the search for articles was performed in three steps. First, a search was performed with the keywords derived from the first theme: “global value chain” OR “global value chains”. A second search was performed with the words related to the second theme: “environment” OR “environmental” OR “green” OR “greening” OR “sustainable” OR “sustainability” OR “environmental upgrading”. The third step was to combine the two searches and thus locate articles that mentioned both themes simultaneously. The keywords were searched in titles and abstracts sequentially. No selection of journals or research areas was performed. Only the category “journals” was considered, and the categories: “conference paper”, “book chapter”, “review”, “article in press”, “book”, “editorial”, “conference review”, “short survey”, “note”, and “conference” were excluded. As a result of this selection, 204 articles were found in Scopus and 239 in Web of Science, totaling 443 articles published between 2000 and 2018. We became aware that a large number of articles were duplicated over the databases, so we removed such duplicates. Of the remaining documents, we used software Atlas.ti to assist in the selection of articles that referred to environmental aspects (water, energy, climate and biodiversity) in the title or abstract. Besides, titles and abstracts were analyzed and contrasted with the inclusion and exclusion criteria to confirm the correct application of terms: “environment”, “environmental”, “sustainable”, and “sustainability” for inclusion in this review. A total of 151 articles were pre-selected at this stage. The selected articles were then read and analyzed in full, resulting in the final selection of 84 articles included in this review. Fig. 1   shows the flowchart of the literature review process.  3.2 Coding Research excellence is largely based on coding excellence (Strauss, 1987 ). To perform this step, manual content analysis associated with content analysis via software Atlas.ti version 8 was used to code the categories, assist in the analysis of the articles in PDF format, and identify the frequency of words. According to Gaur and Kumar (2018)  recommendations, all codings and classifications were made by the authors separately and discussed until agreement was reached. For this analysis, we considered the definitions of environmental upgrading as per Frame 1 . In addition to six of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals were related to the environment, preservation and environmental conservation, covering themes such as water, energy, sustainable production and consumption, climate (reduction of pollutants) and biodiversity, as shown in Table 1 . Based on the research question, it was considered central for our purposes to identify the papers’ authors’ expressed position regarding the integration impact by countries and sectors on environmental upgrading. Two possible positions have been defined. We consider the position to be favorable when the relationship found is positive, without qualifications, and unfavorable when the article brought findings or positions that integration relates to worsening environmental conditions without restricting or qualifying this relationship to specific or particular conditions.  3.3 Categorization Categorization is an operation of classifying constituent elements of a set by differentiation and then regrouping according to gender, with the previously defined criteria, so categorization provides, by condensation, a simplified representation of raw data (Bardin, 2016 ). Three guiding axes were used for the analysis. First axis is the level of analysis in terms of scope. That is, an axis was created to classify articles that evaluated environmental upgrading at the country level and sector level analysis. Second is the result of upgrading. The articles were divided into two possible positions: those with a favorable perspective for environmental upgrading, that indicates that global value chain integration has led to the improvement of environmental conditions, and those with an unfavorable perspective for environmental upgrading, that indicates a worsening of environmental conditions considering the misuse or even the wear of natural resources. Articles were rated on a scale from 0 to 0.5, which the researchers rated as moderately favorable and from 0.5 to 1 as favorable. The converse was true; that is, 0 to −0.5 was moderately unfavorable, and −0.5 to −1 was unfavorable. On the third axis the articles were classified into three categories according to the methodological approach: qualitative studies, quantitative studies and qualitative/quantitative studies. The resulting matrix is exposed in Fig. 2  , with four quadrants guiding the data analysis. Quadrant 1 concentrates the favorable position at the country level and quadrant 2 the unfavorable position at the country level; quadrant 3 concentrates the favorable position at the sector level, and quadrant 4 concentrates the unfavorable position at the sector level.  3.4 Data validity and reliability Some criteria only guarantee validity or reliability; in this study, we chose to use triangulation to guarantee both, composing a more evident picture of the phenomenon through convergence (Paiva et al., 2011 ). Creswell (2010)  suggests triangulating different sources of information by examining the sources’ evidence and using them to create a coherent justification for the themes. If themes are established based on the convergence of various data sources or participants’ perspectives, then it can be inferred that triangulation is helping to validate the study. In this sense, the first researcher classified the articles, then the articles were classified by the second researcher. The discrepancies resulting from the classifications existed and were judged by the third researcher. The next step was to code the sample articles and establish the reliability of the coding process. To assess the degree of agreement on the scores, the kappa coefficient was used. The authors confirmed the reliability of the coding process by separately coding 15 articles that were randomly chosen after discussing the meaning of different categories to avoid possible disagreements. Although there is no agreed and well-defined value, according to the existing literature (Neuendorf, 2002 ; Potter and Levine-Donnerstein, 1999 ), we selected 15 (18%) of the sample articles to test reliability among encoders. Potter and Levine-Donnerstein (1999) suggest that the subsample size for inter-coder reliability testing is 10%–100% of the total sample. Reliability between coders using Cohen’s kappa coefficient was 86.6%, which is acceptable (Neuendorf, 2002 ).   4 Result analysis 4.1 Distribution and theme of the articles More than half of the articles, 44 or 52.38%, were published in the last two years (2017 and 2018), revealing that interest and concern about the environmental issue among the GVC researchers have recently intensified. The articles were published in a wide variety of journals, 46 in total. The major contributors are: Journal of Cleaner production (16,7%); Geoforum (5,9%); Ecological Economics (4,8%); Energy Economics (4,8%); Ecosystem Journal of Biodiversity Science Ecosystem Services and Management (4,8%). Authors who published the most from 2005 to 2018 were Stefano Ponte (5 articles) and Klaus Hubacek (4 articles). Another analysis was the themes (SDG) treated in the articles. From each SDG, subthemes were identified according to Table 2  . In some articles, more than one theme was identified.  4.2 The impact of global value chain integration on environmental upgrading The sector is likely the most significant contingent variable, as affect both the nature of the environmental impacts and the degree and nature of public concern. Other factors which might affect the measurement system are the political climate and legislation of the country, the size of the organization, and its management style and culture. Considering that both aspects, external, such as environmental issues and local context, and internal, like organizational characteristics and corporate strategies, should result in distinct environmental performance measures for diverse countries, sectors and companies (James, 1994 ) this study seeks to verify whether the environmental upgrading perception varies when considering the country level and sector level. The content analysis in relation to the impact of GVC integration on environmental upgrading, according to the criteria outlined in methodology, led the authors to classify 11 articles in quadrant 1 (favorable perception at country level), nine articles in quadrant 2 (unfavorable perception at country level), 23 articles in quadrant 3 (favorable perception at sector level), and 41 articles in quadrant 4 (unfavorable perception at sector level), as shown in Fig. 3  . 4.2.1 Favorable perception at country level Quadrant 1 concentrates 11 quantitative articles that correspond to the favorable perception of integration in GVC at the country level. At the country level, the favorable prospects for inclusion in GVCs in environmental upgrading that stand out are related to sustainable production and consumption (SDG 12–6 articles), followed by energy efficiency (SDG 7–3 articles). Country-level environmental upgrading is related to sustainable production and consumption (SDG 12) through domestic and foreign intersectoral relations that benefit production sustainability and sustainable green technology policies (Costantini et al., 2017 ). In addition, the technological spillover from developed countries would lead to improvement of green technology in countries that participate in global value chains (Song and Wang, 2017 ). In turn, energy efficiency (SDG 7), represented by global energy generated through renewable resources, is indicated as the solution to end “emission points” (Wiebe, 2018 ). Environmental upgrading at the country level happens through the promotion of these renewable energy sources (López et al., 2018 ). For example, the Chinese government is seeking to increase the country’s participation in cleaner alternative technologies including natural gas, which would partly address carbon emissions (López et al., 2014 ). Companies can learn from their integration with GVC, as increases in GVC positions account for 35% of the improvement in energy efficiency (Liu et al., 2018 ). This result reinforces that in an appropriate commercial environment, GVCs can become excellent engines of sustainable energy growth (Ploumen, 2014 ).  4.2.2 Unfavorable perception at country level Quadrant 2 concentrates nine articles, eight quantitative and one qualitative, that correspond to the unfavorable perception of integration in GVC at the country level. Country-level concern is greater for air pollutants (SDG 13–5 articles), followed by water use efficiency (SDGs 6 and 14–2 articles). Environmental upgrading does not happen due to the high levels of atmospheric pollutants (SDG 13) such as greenhouse gases that are released into the atmosphere (Brandi, 2017 ). One example is CO2 and SO2 emissions, production induced China to generate more CO2 than employment and value added (Zhao et al., 2017 ). Although international trade contributes to the global economy, reducing its total CO2 emissions compared to a hypothetical situation without international trade, global value chains have led China to become an air pollutants refuge for other regions (Cai et al., 2018 ), and its exports have increased emissions worldwide (White et al., 2018 ). In short, the environmental cost of international trade is greater than that of domestic production. High levels of carbon emissions are the result of both differences in the level of environmental regulation between countries and the growing fragmentation of production, which requires more international transport shipments across multiple borders (Meng et al., 2018 ). Another aggravating factor is the lack of water use efficiency (SDGs 6 and 14) that is related to water scarcity (Castillo et al., 2017 ) and the shift of industrial activities to developing countries that have disproportionately absorbed the burden of manufacturing industries from developed countries (Incera et al., 2017 ). Water is perhaps the most interconnected and basic resource on our planet. However, billions of people face challenges related to lack of access to water and sanitation (Hyvärinen et al., 2016 ). In addition, biofuel crops require significant amounts of water that could be used for food production, urban supply or power generation (Castillo et al., 2017 ).  4.2.3 Favorable perception at sector level Quadrant 3 concentrates 23 articles, including 17 qualitative, four quantitative and two qualitative/quantitative articles, which correspond to the favorable perception of integration in GVC at the sector level. Although there are fewer articles compared to the unfavorable position, the favorable discussion of insertion in GVC focuses on sustainable production and consumption (SDG 12–18 articles), followed by biodiversity (SDG 15–4 articles) and energy efficiency. (SDG 7–1 article). The favorable position for sustainable production and consumption (SDG 12) indicates the transfer of value systems from the industrialized world to developing countries. It is a way of complementing the precarious sustainability policies of the practices hitherto adopted in these countries, such as in the (table grapes) wine sector (Ras and Vermeulen, 2009 ). In the agricultural sector, broadening the concept of GVC beyond the economy, including both environmental rationalities and sustainable value chain actors, favors the occurrence of environmental upgrading (Glin et al., 2012 ). In addition, in the apparel sector, GVCs represent both the drivers of environmental upgrading and the means to gain knowledge and goals for environmental performance (Khattak et al., 2015 ). Regarding biodiversity (SDG 15), companies in the agricultural and furniture sector inserted in GVC rely on the principle of good governance to reduce forest and land fires (Purnomo et al., 2018 ). In addition, vertical integration and fair trade can create a prize for furniture SMEs and tree producers to drive planting towards sustainability (Purnomo et al., 2009 ). Besides, there is a growth in private investments in the agri-food sector to address environmental issues (Rueda et al., 2017 ) and support for broader strategies that concern social and environmental upgrading (Klooster and Mercado-Celis, 2016 ). Another theme that indicates environmental upgrading is energy efficiency (SDG 7). The creation of a solar energy GVC in the Caribbean has replaced carbon dioxide dependency – one cause of climate damage – and reducing electricity costs and oil imports (Charles, 2014 ).  4.2.4 Unfavorable perception at sector level Quadrant 4 concentrates 41 articles, of which 32 qualitative, five quantitative and four qualitative/quantitative articles correspond to the unfavorable perception of integration in GVC at the sector level. At the sector level, integration in GVC does not cause environmental upgrading, mainly due to difficulties in relation to sustainable production and consumption (SDG 12–28 articles), followed by biodiversity (SDG 15–9 articles), air pollutants (SDG 13–5 articles), water use efficiency (SDGs 6 and 14–2 articles) and energy efficiency (SDG 7–1 article). In the unfavorable perspective of sustainable production and consumption (SDG 12) are problems related to regulation (certification) in both the agricultural and industrial sectors where the legitimacy of Northern versus Southern standards is discussed. There is a perceived lack of legitimacy in global standards, especially from a Southern perspective. This is explicitly done to create a cognitive and moral distance from Northern standards (Kagawa et al., 2015 ). In addition, Southern standards target different audiences for legitimacy and depend on different sources of legitimacy compared to established Northern standards (Schouten and Bitzer, 2015 ). Also, stands out the low return on investment, especially for small producers. Companies need to see the financial return associated to their improved environmental performance. In apparel sector the environmental upgrading is limited by the lack of mechanisms to ensure that suppliers can achieve return on investment (Goger, 2013 ). Same complaint can be noted on textile (Kogg and Mont, 2012 ), and forest sector (Klooster, 2006 ). Still as unfavorable perspective in the agri-food sector are the lack of definition/application of international rules (Olper, 2016 ) and inclusive sustainability networks (Ponte and Cheyns, 2013 ). In maritime sector, the negative view is on the lack of a stronger alignment in the shipping industry between regulation, industry sustainability initiatives and the multi-stakeholder (Poulsen et al., 2016 ). With regard to biodiversity (SDG 15), the main problems encountered in the biofuel sector that prevent environmental upgrading are the informal land lease (Nygaard and Bolwig, 2018 ), the improper expropriation of land (Neimark et al., 2016 ), and the biodiversity loss due to land destruction (Mintz-Habib, 2013 ). In addition to mismanagement, illegal logging, land conflicts and clashes between producers and SMEs over land grabbing observed in Indonesia’s teak forestry sector (Purnomo et al., 2009 ). Another issue that does not favor environmental upgrading at the sector level is the emission of air pollutants (SDG 13). In the shipping industry, long-term growth in both shipping volume and emissions appears to be substantially greater than any eco-efficiency gains. Regulatory controls, such as those developed for some European waters, will do little to reduce carbon emissions (Pettit et al., 2018 ). Another aggravating factor is the transfer of pollution-intensive metal manufacturing processes from developed countries to developing countries due to less stringent environmental regulations in these countries, thus keeping manufacturing processes “clean” in developed countries (Xiong et al., 2018 ). Inefficiency in water use (SDGs 6 and 14) shows that pollution is not the only critical point. Scarcity of this resource can also lead to serious consequences, as in China and India classified as “high risk countries”, due to high water use intensity in highly polluting sectors such as electricity production and the chemical industry (Acquaye et al., 2017 ). The same happens for crops that use substantial water amounts and cause pollution through toxic runoff from pesticide and herbicide sprays, which makes access to water increasingly difficult in some communities (Noor et al., 2017 ). In addition, the intensive use of chemicals in leather production that contaminates water with chromium also causes air pollution through the use of organic solvents (Memedovic and Mattila, 2008 ). Finally, the lack of energy efficiency (SDG 7). Changes in GVCs and their sectoral composition may dampen the increase in global energy footprints. However, until this occurs, they are unlikely to be able to offset the growing demand for energy (Kaltenegger et al., 2017 ). The consolidated result by SDG and analysis level can be seen in Table 3  . As per the literature perspective SDG 6 and 14 (water efficiency) and SDG 13 (climate change) are unfavorable both at country and sector level. SDG 7 (energy efficiency) and 12 (sustainable production and consumption) presented inconclusive results and SDG 15 presented an unfavorable view from the sector level.    5 Discussion The purpose of this section, based on the results, is to present a consolidation of the SDG-related environmental upgrading and propose future research agendas for each point. Inclusion in the global value chain does not favor environmental upgrading related to water use efficiency (SDG 6 and 14) at both country and sector levels. Including companies in the GVC does not guarantee a favorable outlook for environmental upgrading, as there is a transfer of industrial activities to developing countries, which results in the use of scarce water resources (Incera et al., 2017 ). Moreover, it is found that companies do not deal with toxic runoff (Noor et al., 2017 ) and the intensive use of chemicals (Memedovic and Mattila, 2008 ) in water. This implies a research agenda that:a) Evaluates the main problems that prevent environmental upgrading related to water use and,  b) Determines what must be done so global value chains can facilitate conservation of the planet’s natural water reserves.    At both country and sector levels, insertion in global value chains does not allow environmental upgrading to take place due to the emission of atmospheric pollutants (SDG 13) observed as high rates of CO2 and SO2 emissions (Zhao et al., 2017 ) and greenhouse gases (Brandi, 2017 ), and on the creation of pollution havens that concentrate emissions from developed and developing countries such as China (Cai et al., 2018 ). This implies a research agenda that can:c) Suggest to countries, sectors and companies more sustainable paths towards replacing non-renewable energy – associated with pollution and environmental degradation – with renewable energy or clean energy.    GVC participation favors energy efficiency-related environmental upgrading (SDG 7) both at the country level (Liu et al., 2018 ) and the sector level, although the latter still controversial. There is a favorable outlook at the sector level regarding the replacement of carbon dioxide with solar energy (Charles, 2014 ). On the other hand, there is an unfavorable outlook that as much as changes in GVCs dampen the increase in global energy footprints, the effort is still not enough (Kaltenegger et al., 2017 ), so the position is inconclusive. This requires a research agenda to:d) Corroborate the existence of a favorable or unfavorable tendencies for countries to look for sustainable alternatives for energy generation.    Integration into GVC does not favor biodiversity (SDG 15) related to environmental upgrading at the sector level. Participation in GVC does not guarantee a favorable outlook for environmental upgrading due to factors such as informal land lease (Nygaard and Bolwig, 2018 ), improper expropriation of land (Neimark et al., 2016 ), and biodiversity loss due to land destruction (Mintz-Habib, 2013 ). However, we have no country-level surveys. The lack of a country-level position demands a research agenda that:e) Seeks a (favorable or unfavorable) perception of soil and ecosystem use and conservation so results can be compared between levels of analysis.  f) At the same time, conducts research indicating measures to undertake environmental upgrading of biodiversity.    As the energy efficiency, sustainable production and consumption (SDG 12) indicates a favorable outlook for country-level environmental upgrading, but unfavorable at the sector level. As a favorable country level outlook are the intersectoral relations that favor sustainable production (Costantini et al., 2017 ), the values transfer from the industrialized world (Ras and Vermeulen, 2009 ), the technology transfer and financial aid (Sakai et al., 2017 ) and the technological spillover from developed countries to emerging countries (Song and Wang, 2017 ). On the sector level, the unfavorable outlook are point to the standards and certifications that do not indicate the right way to more systemic change (Glasbergen, 2018 ) the need for stronger government presence (Larsen et al., 2018 ), the challenge of getting consumers to pay more to small producers (Minten et al., 2018 ), the lack of definition for international rules (Olper, 2016 ) and the lack of global regulation associated with industry sustainability initiatives and multiple stakeholders (Poulsen et al., 2016 ). This calls for a research agenda that explains:g) Why practices and production processes observed at the country level do not show the same results as at the sector level.  h) Why regulatory and certification difficulties encountered at the sector level are not perceived at the country level.    A limitation that also suggests a research agenda is related to the restricted number of firm-level articles. In this literature review, we found only five articles with firm-level research, all qualitative and related only to sustainable production and consumption (SDG 12), of which three articles deal with production, and two are on regulation/certification. At the firm level, discussions are lacking on environmental upgrading related to water use efficiency (SDGs 6 and 14), energy efficiency (SDG 7), air pollutants (SDG 13), and biodiversity (SDG 15). Even with this small number of articles, a favorable perspective of the insertion of firms in GVC in environmental upgrading was noted. Companies are already known to develop green strategies to reduce environmental impacts while gaining economic benefits and competitiveness, which may be internal to the company, but also apply to value chains, with different implications for bargaining power and value appropriation (De Marchi et al., 2013a ). Even buyer-driven and large supplier-driven GVCs have a significant effect on suppliers’ environmental policies (Ivarsson and Alvstam, 2010 ) as in the case of Nike, which has expanded its supplier concerns to the company’s working conditions, environmental protection and welfare community (Lim and Phillips, 2008 ). Strong interaction with suppliers, both to develop new products and check process conditions, characterized GVCs in which leading companies have effectively been able to reduce environmental damage along supply chains (De Marchi et al., 2013b ).  6 Conclusion The purpose of this research was to analyze whether insertion in global value chains favors environmental upgrading, considering country and the sector as analysis level. The overall result presents an unfavorable outlook for environmental upgrading. The unfavorable points are associated with SDGs 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, and 15. Although favorable at the country level, SDG 7 is inconclusive at the sector level, as it presents both favorable and unfavorable prospects. Of the eighty-four articles in this literature review, twenty refer to the country level and sixty-four to the sector level. Articles with favorable outlook are eleven at the country level and twenty-three at the sector level. Unfavorable view are nine articles at the country level and forty-one at the sector level. At both, country and sector level, most articles with a favorable view are related to sustainable production and consumption (SDG 12). Although the same SDG 12 proves to be the biggest sector-level concern with twenty-eight unfavorable publications. The second major concern at the sector level is biodiversity (SDG 15) with nine publications. However, no country level studies were found for this SDG. The main concern at the country level is air pollution (SDG 13) followed by water use efficiency (SDG 6 and 14), which are also among the concerns at the sector level. Both analysis levels present five publications regarding SDG 13, related to air pollution, and two publications regarding SDG 6 and 14, related to water efficiency. Evidence at the firm level is missing due to the limited number of articles found, only five, all related to SDG 12. Despite the restricted number, a favorable view was noted at firm level. The impacts of authors’ own choices in the research is considered a study limitation. As an academic contribution, this article provides an in-depth analysis of critical environmental issues based on Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals, that can lead global value chain companies to reach environmental upgrading. The study seeks to foster discussion of environmental upgrading in global value chains by indicating which strategies and management practices can be implemented by firms to reduce their environmental impacts (De Marchi et al., 2013a ). It thus provides insights into the academic debate about how emerging economies and low-income countries can use GVC to achieve sustainable development (Costantini et al., 2017 ; Liu et al., 2018 ), promoting greater understanding of environmental management at country and sector level. The research agenda outlined here encourages studies that promote the intersection of GVCs with the SDGs. It is important for two reasons. First, global value chains drive social and environmental reforms (Bush et al., 2015 ). Second, the SDGs provide an opportunity to promote more radical conceptual approaches and practices that challenge the reduced understanding of sustainability (Moore, 2015 ). As a managerial contribution, the study indicates to companies that participate in global value chains, or intend to participate, which environmental hot spots should be addressed with the greatest attention and even require more investment to preserve the environment. It seeks to point out to decision-makers which environmental issues should be addressed by local and global companies most urgently in order to avoid environmental collapse. The research also provides insights into sustainable corporate actions such as the development of sustainable production, clean energy that replaces the damage caused by non-renewable energy pollution, the treatment of water used in industrial processes, as well as soil conservation and reforestation. As a social contribution, the study seeks to indicate a public policy development agenda to foster the creation of public policies aimed at preserving the environment based on SDG. The State plays a fundamental role in stimulating environmental certifications capable of regulating both primary production that uses and interacts with the local resource base (biodiversity, soil and water), and emissions of air pollutants (toxic substances or emissions of greenhouse gases). In short, the government should make companies effectively assume their share of responsibility for environmental preservation, thus achieving the United Nation’s proposed sustainable development goals.
