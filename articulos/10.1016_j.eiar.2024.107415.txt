                  The escalating impact of climate change stemming from greenhouse gas emissions within OECD nations necessitates a thorough examination of the interplay between various factors influencing CO2 emissions. Therefore, it is vital to analyzes the relationship between energy transition (ET), eco-policy stringency (EPS), green technovation (GT), and primary energy consumption (PEC) on CO2 emissions between 1995 to 2019 for 26 OECD economies. Notably, the study explores the interaction term of EPS with ET and GT, aiming for a thorough understanding of their impact. Employing Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR) and robust estimations such as Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS), Dynamic OLS, Fixed Effects Ordinary Least Squares (FE-OLS), and Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012) causality tests, this study examines the varying impacts of variables across different quantiles. The MMQR results reveal that ET and interaction between EPS*GT reduce environmental degradation in all quantiles (10th to 90th), however EPS, PEC, and interaction between EPS*ET intensify carbon emissions. The robustness of outcomes is confirmed by FMOLS, DOLS, and FE-OLS methods. Causality tests indicate bidirectional associations of GT, ET, EPS, EPS*GT, and PEC with carbon emissions, while EPS*ET exhibits a unidirectional causal link. The implications suggest the critical importance of integrating green technovation and balanced eco-policy stringency and energy transition measures to effectively mitigate CO2 emissions. It emphasizes the need for dynamic, adaptive policies aligned with Sustainable Development Goals 7 and 13, focusing on sustainable energy practices and concerted climate action within OECD economies.

Research Institute of Business Analytics & Supply Chain Management College of Management Shenzhen University China       The escalating impact of climate change stemming from greenhouse gas emissions within OECD nations necessitates a thorough examination of the interplay between various factors influencing CO2 emissions. Therefore, it is vital to analyzes the relationship between energy transition (ET), eco-policy stringency (EPS), green technovation (GT), and primary energy consumption (PEC) on CO2 emissions between 1995 to 2019 for 26 OECD economies. Notably, the study explores the interaction term of EPS with ET and GT, aiming for a thorough understanding of their impact. Employing Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR) and robust estimations such as Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS), Dynamic OLS, Fixed Effects Ordinary Least Squares (FE-OLS), and Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012) causality tests, this study examines the varying impacts of variables across different quantiles. The MMQR results reveal that ET and interaction between EPS*GT reduce environmental degradation in all quantiles (10th to 90th), however EPS, PEC, and interaction between EPS*ET intensify carbon emissions. The robustness of outcomes is confirmed by FMOLS, DOLS, and FE-OLS methods. Causality tests indicate bidirectional associations of GT, ET, EPS, EPS*GT, and PEC with carbon emissions, while EPS*ET exhibits a unidirectional causal link. The implications suggest the critical importance of integrating green technovation and balanced eco-policy stringency and energy transition measures to effectively mitigate CO2 emissions. It emphasizes the need for dynamic, adaptive policies aligned with Sustainable Development Goals 7 and 13, focusing on sustainable energy practices and concerted climate action within OECD economies.

The repercussions of these changes, such as rising global temperatures, extreme weather events, and a surge in climate-related hazards, underscore the critical need for effective policy interventions. Despite collaborative efforts such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement, recent reports, including the Progress report on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (United-Nations, 2020 ), highlight the inadequacy of emerging economies in addressing escalating emissions levels. At present, although affluent countries throughout the globe are making significant improvements toward achieving sustainable energy imminent while also humanizing environmental quality, emerging economies are grappling with rising emissions levels. One of the fundamental causes for such a scenario in these nations is the dominating usage of fossil fuel energy, and this continued dependence on fossil fuel-based energy solutions is also putting these countries' energy security at risk. (United-Nations, 2019 ) evolution reported these nations chastised for prioritizing funds in fossil fuel-based energy production though ignoring eco-friendly initiatives. However, some OECD nations have previously enacted a broad range of environmental strategies involving market tools such as pricing and tax systems and non-market tools, including ecological standards and rules compliance. The fundamental disagreement opposing stricter environmental rules has been the fear that the additional expenditures would burden the economy. For instance, the United States, the world's second-largest polluter, withdrew from the Paris Agreement in 2017, declaring that “the Paris agreement will damage (the US's) economy” and “puts (the US) in trouble.” Whereas in 2016 environmental program stressed reducing carbon emissions via cleaner energy, the new administration has pushed to boost the use of fossil fuels and repeal environmental laws, which the current authority has described as an obstacle to the US. These topical environmental policy measures are based on the assumption that more eco-friendly regulations impede efficiency (Feng et al., 2021 ). Concurrently, (Bronstein, 2020 ) reported that Research Triangle Institute (RTI) highlighted the challenges of current renewable energy solutions, which may limit their spread in underdeveloped nations. As a result, despite their technological accessibility, economies have yet to take advantage of the low-carbon energy transition, which might have resulted in higher energy efficiency however maintaining mechanisms over the underlying concerns of environmental deterioration. During a conversation about the Illumination Global initiative , the World Bank stressed the significance of energy transition in addressing the issue of energy poverty, and they also mentioned a potential policy consolidation in achieving SDG 7 goals (WDI, 2021 ). This suggests that present energy-environmental-related economic policies in developing countries may need to be reoriented and that to do so, a complete SDG framework may be necessary. Considering the SDG 7, there is a requirement for inexpensive, accessible, and clean energy. Furthermore, the rising economic expansion necessitates higher energy consumption, leading to more emissions and a significant danger to humans and the environment. Hence, it is vital to focus on contributing factors that help policymakers to achieve SDGs. In this context, many studies used different factors, methods and time period such as for USA (Ramzan et al., 2023a ), OECD (Zhao et al., 2022a ), Global sample (Abbasi et al., 2022a ), India (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2022 ) emerging nations (Awan et al., 2022 ) but the choice of sample OECD nations from 1995 to 2019 differs from earlier studies as the study's focus on policy implications that avoided earlier. Thereby renewable energy output shows standardization in developed economies; it is yet to be achieved in emerging nations (Sinha et al., 2020 ). As a result, in developed countries, energy efficiency may not have the desired influence on CO2 emissions. It justifies building a policy framework for realigning current energy policies in the quest for environmental protection. This argument supports the necessity for a policy framework for OECD countries to accomplish climate action by reconfiguring environmental policies to achieve SDGs. This discourse is reasonable to assume that a comprehensive SDG framework is important to ensure adherence to the 2030 agenda. To this end, the current research will estimate the effect of the energy transition, technovation, eco-policy, and primary energy, as well as the interaction between eco-policy*green technovation (INT-1) and eco-policy stringency*energy transition (INT-2) in ensuring environmental sustainability in OECD nations from 1995 to 2019, resulting in fresh insights and suggestions on the advantages and drawbacks of respective factors of CO2 emissions. Upon completing this empirical investigation, this paper will offer a complete policy framework for attaining SDGs and adjusting low-pollution via energy transition. Given that these economies are deemed to be falling behind in achieving the SDGs, a policy reconfiguration through the recommendation of a rigorous policy framework may assist in constructing a threshold perspective and could be used as a yardstick for synchronizing current policies in other developing economies. By including energy transition, green technovation, eco-policy, and carbon emissions into an empirical framework, it may be possible to offer a holistic policy agenda for achieving the goals of SDG 13, and SDG 7. Though, when explaining the policy context, an incremental execution outline may be suggested, as the robustness of a policy framework includes the politico-economic links and structural similarities amid these nations, and therefore, a phased integration outline of the SDG agenda may be proposed. According to our knowledge of the literature, such a policy reintegration strategy for addressing environmental degradation, energy transition, green technovation, and eco-policy stringency has not been implemented. Here, the research makes a policy contribution by advocating a baseline SDGs framework for OECD countries. In light of the aforementioned discussions and concerns, this research contributes to the present literature in various ways. First , despite the critical importance of climate change and the persuasive reasons for the role of energy transition and eco-policy stringency, empirical research on this topic is lacking, which motivates us to investigate the dynamic effect of energy transition (ET), eco-policy stringency (EPS), green technovation (GT), and primary energy consumption (PEC), as well as the interaction between eco-policy stringency*energy transition (INT-1) and eco-policy stringency* green technovation (INT-2) in OECD economies from 1995 to 2019. Second,  we use a novel cross-country EPS proxy index in our research. What distinguishes our study from prior research is its unique approach in enabling the Eco-Policy Stringency (EPS) index to exert influence on every facet of the environment. By empowering this index to dynamically impact all model coefficients, our research aims to shed light on pivotal questions:• Does Energy Transition possess the potential to effectively curtail CO2 emissions?  • To what extent does the consistency of eco-policies influence CO2 emissions?  • How impactful is Green technovation in reducing carbon emissions?  • What is the moderating effect between Eco-Policy Stringency and Energy Transition (EPS*ET) on CO2 emissions?  • How does the interaction between Eco-Policy Stringency and Green Technovation (EPS*GT) affect CO2 emissions?  • Does the usage of Primary Energy lead to an increase in CO2 emissions?    This innovative approach allows for a comprehensive exploration of these critical questions, providing a better understanding of the intricate relationships between environmental policies, energy transition, green innovation, and their collective impact on carbon emissions within OECD economies. Third, t his study adds to thin body literature by adopting an innovative technique called “Quantile Moments Quantile Regression” (MMQR), created by (Machado and Santos Silva, 2019 ). When this method is combined with fixed effects, it becomes simpler to get a thorough insight into the association's heterogeneity. This approach also enables heterogeneous energy-emissions linkages at several conditional quantile distributions, which classic mean regressions do not capture. To the best of the author's knowledge, we use the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Square (FM-OLS), Dynamic Ordinary Least Square (D-OLS), Fixed Effects Ordinary Least Square (FE-OLS), and Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel causality, which is limited in the environmental literature and for the selected OECD economies. Finally , the findings of this study will assist policymakers in this region and others in developing countries establish appropriate policies to better comprehend the influence of these variables on environmental deterioration. The remaining sections of this investigation are as follows: The next section  (2) is a review of the literature, whereas section  (3) discusses data and methods, section  (4) discusses findings and discussion, and section  (5) concludes the research with policy suggestions.  2 Literature review In recent years, global warming has become the most widely disputed environmental concern. GHG and CO2 emissions, according to COP26, are the primary cause of global warming. Several academicians and policymakers have lately emphasized diverse environmental elements. We focused on a specific empirical study and categorized it into three categories: 2.1 Energy transition and environment Energy use, as previously indicated, has traditionally been the major source of greenhouse gas emissions. A large body of literature review (Abbasi et al., 2021, 2022b ; Udeagha and Breitenbach, 2023a ) has demonstrated the negative impacts of fossil fuel energy, primarily oil and coal, on the ecosystem. Furthermore, using a Bayesian Model Averaging for 92 nations (Aller et al., 2021 ) revealed that fossil fuel usage significantly influences the environment. Additionally, (Leitão, 2021 ; Leitão et al., 2022 ) focused on the impact of renewable energy sources in mitigating environmental deterioration. They applied ARDL, FMOLS, DOLS, panel quantile regression and concluded the need to switch from fossil fuels to sustainable energies to decrease environmental damage and global warming. As a result, energy transition has been recognized a necessary step toward environmental sustainability. In contrast (Menyah and Wolde-Rufael, 2010 ) found that nuclear energy has a substantial role in mitigating environmental degradation, but renewable energy does not. Furthermore, (Koengkan and Alberto Fuinhas, 2020 ) probed the environmental effects of Latin American energy transitions. The evidence suggests that energy transition is linked to fewer polluting emissions. Even though most previous research has revealed that increased REC helps reduce CO2 emissions, numerous studies have refuted this hypothesis such as (Sharif et al., 2020 ) stated that RE usage does not lower CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions. The researchers have noted that the negligible positive effects of RE use are considerably larger for developed countries. In contrast, the effects are less obvious in comparably impoverished countries. Similarly, (Khattak et al., 2020 ) stated that despite RE use helping CO2 emission reductions across a panel of BRICS economies, the country-specific benefits of RE use on CO2 emanations varied among the BRICS states. Thailand (Abbasi et al., 2021 ) discovered that RE has an adverse impact on CO2 emissions. For United States (Yi et al., 2023 ) employed dynamic ARDL and KRLS methods and indicated thatRE has a positive long-term effect, implying that the United States hasn't reached a stage where reliance on renewable energy alone is adequate to decrease CO2 emissions.  2.2 Eco-policy stringency and environment Recently, policymakers' intense focus has been moving toward determining whether the stringency of a country's eco-policy is related to its environmental performance. The (OECD, 2016 ) defines stringency as the “implicit or explicit penalty of ecologically hazardous activity” (p. 5). For example, by striking carbon taxes, fuel-intensive items may be substituted, causing the configuration of energy production and depletion to shift toward more environmentally friendly commodities (Mardones and Baeza, 2018 ). The goal of designing a stand-in for environmental law and control stringency is used to determine if these laws and regulations may be used to study their effect not just on the environment but also on other critical policy issues, such as the impact of this stringency on a firm's worldwide competitiveness and technological development (Mulatu, 2018 ). Strict environmental policies may stimulate mitigation measures and provide incentives for producing and using cleaner energy (Dechezleprêtre and Sato, 2017 ). In the context of BRICS countries (Udeagha and Muchapondwa, 2023a ; Udeagha and Ngepah, 2023a ) applied CS-ARDL approach and revealed that environmental policy stringency (EPS) reduces carbon dioxide. While for South Africa (Udeagha and Ngepah, 2019 ) confirmed the inverted U-shaped curve that authorizes the presence of environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. Additionally, (Udeagha and Ngepah, 2022a ) applied QARDL and suggested technological revolution benefits diminish CO2 emissions that supports the existence EKC. For the SADC region, (Udeagha and Breitenbach, 2021 ) found that, amplified TO expands environmental quality. For Eurasia (Lin et al., 2023 ) explained the mechanism by which cold wave events affect precipitation. For South Africa, (Udeagha and Ngepah, 2021b ) confirmed that, energy consumption and industrial value-added deteriorate environmental quality. MENA region (Albaker et al., 2023 ) used novel MMQR approach, and revealed that renewable energy and green innovation diminishes carbon emissions. The BRICS nations (Udeagha and Ngepah, 2023b ) used CS-ARDL model and recommended that, development of green financial products and use renewable energy sources have significant potential to reduce emissions. Previous research has primarily examined isolated elements such as trade openness, the integration of renewable energy, and advancements in green innovation concerning their individual impact on CO2 emissions. Consequently, this study endeavors to explore the influence of the stringency of environmental policies on the quality of the environment. This approach diverges from the narrower focus of prior investigations, aiming to encompass a broader spectrum of factors for a more holistic understanding.  2.3 Green technovation and environment Tech-novation has lately gained more attention in climate change literature. Pioneering efforts initiated by (Fussler and James, 1996 ). For greenest nations in the world (Ramzan et al., 2023b ) used MMQR and reported that, green innovation lessens environmental pollution. Additionally, for US (Zhang et al., 2023b ) claimed that environmental innovation benefits carbon capture and storage. Instantaneously, (Leitão et al., 2021, 2023 ) highlighted the critical role of carbon capture and storage in mitigating global warming. (Udeagha and Breitenbach, 2023b ) stated, technovation helps economies to lower the cost of RE and accelerate the transition from fossil fuels. However, for Pakistan (Zhang et al., 2023a ) reported technological innovation has a long-term useful effect on electricity depletion. For OECD states (Iqbal et al., 2021 ) indicated that eco-innovation supports the replacement of outdated technologies with more up-to-date and environmentally friendly alternatives, hence lowering harmful emissions. In South Africa (Udeagha and Muchapondwa, 2022 ) indicated that technological innovation upsurge environmental quality. For Denmark (Kirikkaleli et al., 2023a ) concluded that ecological innovations have an adverse impact on environment. For Turkey (Kirikkaleli et al., 2023b ) used Fourier-based approaches indicated that, green technology assertively cut the carbon emission. The results are consistent with earlier studies, (Udeagha and Breitenbach, 2023a ) confirmed technological innovation helps to reduce environmental pollution. Also, and (Ning et al., 2023 ) endorsed that outcome by using dynamic ARDL model. Most of the aforementioned research focused exclusively on the effects of EC on CO2 emanation reactions though generally overlooking the outcomes of environmental innovation. Therefore, this research intends to contribute to the limited body of literature by scrutinizing the influences of tech-novation share on OECD to mitigate CO2 emissions.  2.4 Research gap Based on the comprehensive literature review above, we may conclude that various research includes (Udeagha and Ngepah, 2023b ; Zhang et al., 2023c ) used distinct variables, approaches and provided equivocal results. The lack of policy tools as factors of environmental eminence are striking. By far, no research has attempted to investigate the influence of energy transition, environmental policy stringency, and technological innovation on carbon emissions. Given the substantial resources allocated to pollution mitigation, analyzing the efficacy of environmental rubrics and guidelines is particularly critical now that the OECD has developed a globally comparable index of environmental policy stringency. The current eco-policy may significantly influence such effects, and this moderation is often seen as an undetected or hidden effect. Without measuring this hidden influence of eco-policy, policymakers might be impeded. It is required to harmonize current policies in OECD nations to build an SDG-oriented reform agenda. The main contribution of this paper is to establish this SDG-oriented reform agenda whereas pondering the energy transition, eco-policy stringency, technovation, and primary energy consumption on CO2 emissions. This might be used to characterize the study's contribution.   3 Methodological framework 3.1 Data sources and variables We utilize a balanced yearly panel data set of 26 OECD countries for 1995–2019 that we compiled from various sources. One of the primary reasons for selecting these OECD nations is that energy usage accounts for around 35% of worldwide CO2 emissions, related to >50% in 1990. A more complex picture emerges when emissions are seen through the lens of ultimate demand. OECD nations' carbon footprints are often greater than domestic output emissions (OECD, 2020 ). Hence, the study uses Carbon dioxide emissions (Tonnes, Millions) (CE)   as an explained variable (World Bank). Energy Transition (ET):   This variable serves as a proxy for renewable electricity output (% of total electricity output) sourced from World Development Indicators (WDI, 2019 ). Eco-Policy (EPS ):  The Environmental Policy Stringency Index (EPS) is a country-specific indicator adopted from (OECD, 2023 ). By encompassing 14 environmental policy measures, including those concerning climate change and air pollution. Green Technovation (Total Patents):   This variable serves as a proxy for the number of patents related to environmental technologies (OECD, 2023 ). Primary Energy Consumption (PEC):   Derived from (BP_Statistical, 2019 ), this variable encompasses the overall energy consumption, including commercially traded fossil fuels and current renewable energy sources used for energy generation (measured in exajoules). Further description and the trend of the variables shows in Fig. 1   .  3.2 Theoretical underpinning Energy Transition (ET),   represents the pivotal shift from conventional fossil fuels to renewable sources in electricity generation. Tracking this transition is crucial in understanding the progress and impact of renewable energy adoption within the studied economies (Zhang et al., 2023c ). The inclusion of this variable helps assess the advancement toward sustainable energy production and mitigate emissions. Eco-Policy (EPS) ,  quantifies the stringency of environmental regulations within each country. EPS provides a comprehensive overview of the regulatory framework and the level of commitment to addressing environmental challenges (Jiang and Xu, 2023 ). This variable enables an assessment of how stringent environmental policies influence the studied economies. Green Technovation (Total Patents),   utilizing search techniques designed for environmental technology identification, it captures innovations focused on ecological management, climate change mitigation, adaptation, and sustainability (Udeagha and Muchapondwa, 2023b ). Tracking patents in this area offers insights into the technological advancements and innovations contributing to environmental sustainability within the economies under study. Primary Energy Consumption (PEC),   signifies the total energy demand within an economy and provides a holistic view of energy usage patterns, including the reliance on traditional fossil fuels versus renewable sources (Wu et al., 2023 ). Understanding PEC is crucial in assessing energy security, environmental impacts, and the potential for transitioning to sustainable energy sources. Also, using interaction terms between environmental policy stringency and key variables like energy transition and green technovation to examine their impact on CO2 emissions is an astute approach. These interaction terms allow for a deeper exploration of how these variables collectively influence CO2 emissions within the context of environmental policy stringency. Each of these variables is carefully selected to offer a comprehensive understanding of various facets crucial to the study's focus on energy transition, eco-policy stringency, green technovation, and energy consumption within the OECD economies. Their inclusion allows for a nuanced analysis of the interplay between environmental policies, technological advancements, and energy dynamics in shaping sustainable development pathways. Based on the aforementioned mechanisms governing CO2 emissions, this research extends its inquiry by employing the MMQR technique recommended by (Machado and Santos Silva, 2019 ) with fixed effects. The primary objective remains the empirical analysis of the dynamic interrelations among energy transition (ET), eco-policy stringency (EPS), green technovation (GT), and primary energy use (PEU). Additionally, it aims to explore the intricate interactions between eco-policy stringency with both energy transition (INT-1) and green technovation (INT-2) within the scope of OECD economies, leveraging this approach to deepen our understanding of CO2 emission determinants. Traditional panel quantile regression approaches can pinpoint the presence of unseen variability throughout the panel, but they cannot detect outliers. As mentioned by (Canay, 2011 ) and others, this technique unavoidably examines the impact of the conditional heterogeneous CO2 determinants' covariance by urging the distinct upshot to affect the over-all rather than just changing the methods. This strategy may handle the potential of explanatory factors including endogenous traits. This strategy might be used when individual impacts immerse the panel data paradigm. When producing non-crossing estimates in quantile regression, the MMQR delivers trustworthy estimates in the case of the nonlinear equation. The model for this study is based on (Awosusi et al., 2022 ), and it is as follows:(1) CE it  = ϑ 0  + ϑ 1  ET it  + ϑ 2  EPS it  + ϑ 3  GT it  + ϑ 4  INT 1 it  + ϑ 5  INT 2 it  + ϑ 6  PEC it  + ε t      where: i   signifies the cross-sections (OECD economies); t is period of data analysis (1995 to 2019); ϑ   represents the parameter coefficient, and ε   means the error term. It predicted that there would be a negative relationship between energy transition (ET) and CO2 emissions (CE) ϑ 1  ∂ CE  ∂ ET   <    . Prior research has offered eco-policy stringency (EPS) to raise and reduce environmental deterioration ϑ 2  ∂ CE  ∂ EPS   <    . We anticipate the following indicators for the drivers' carbon emissions: we comprehend an adverse link between green technovation (GT) and CE, i.e., ϑ 4  ∂ CE  ∂ GT   <    . We predict a negative relationship between EPS and CE, i.e., ϑ 3  ∂ CE  ∂ EPS   <    . Finally, for interaction between EPS*ET and EPS*GT could be a positive or negative correlation, ϑ 6  ∂ CE  ∂ INT − 1  and  INT − 2    < 0 >    . Also, we anticipate a positive link between primary energy consumption (PEC) and CE, i.e., ϑ 5  ∂ CE  ∂ PEC   <    . Fig. 2   displays a visual representation of the research paradigm.  3.3 Slope coefficients and cross-section dependence test We commonly infer that the shocks are not CSD when estimating panel data. However, since CSD often appears, neglecting it may result in incorrect regression findings. As a result, we begin our study by running several CSD tests. Therefore, we conduct two kinds of CSD testing following the environmental literature (Udeagha and Ngepah, 2023c ). Pesaran's CD test was proposed by (Pesaran, 2007 ). We also use the (Chudik and Pesaran, 2015 ) CD test to assess cross-section dependency apprehensions. Once the CSD outcomes are obtained, the next step is to validate panel data stationarity or the unit root method. Many experts are anxious about the problem of non-stationarity in panel data. The existing literature on non-stationarity in panel data is classified into three categories: first-generation, second-generation, and third-generation panel unit root tests (Ma et al., 2023 ; Shang and Luo, 2021 ). Avoiding CSD and slope coefficient fluctuation will erroneous and inconsistent results (Udeagha and Ngepah, 2023d ). The usual equation for the Pesaran cross-section (CD) test is as follows:(2) CD test  = 2 T  N N − 1      ∑ i = 1  N − 1   ∑ k = i + 1  N  τ ̂  ik        The H0 indicates independence, whereas the H1 indicates dependency. Though the variables used to calculate the slope coefficient are as regards:(3) ∆ ∼  HPY  = N  1 2   2 k   − 1 2    1 N  S ∼  − k      (4) ∆ ∼  ASH  = N  1 2   2 k T − k − 1    T + 1    − 1 2    1 N  S ∼  − 2 k       The H0 asserts that Δ and customizable Δ slope coefficients are homogeneous, while the H1 asserts heterogeneous.  3.4 Stationary properties The study uses first-generation stationery tests, including the Im Pesaran and Shin, Lin & Chu tests, which are incapable of determining CSD and heterogeneous slope coefficients (Udeagha and Muchapondwa, 2023c ). The importance of unit root tests in minimizing false regression cannot be overstated. In this work, we use three-unit root techniques such as CIPS, CADF, and (BCS 2009). In comparison to other accessible unit root tests (BCS 2009) initially created due to structural breakdown benefits (Xu et al., 2023b ). These assessments suggest various unit root tests comprising M-tests (Stock, 1999 ). Second, the statistical technique indicates several impenetrable structural developments under H0 and H1. BCS (2009) make the assumptions as follows:y t  = d t  + u t     (5) u t  = α u  t  + V t  = 0 , … … , T .     where y t    is a time series, u t    with a mean of zero denoting the error term. u t    is intended to be zero. The perturbation is represented byV t   . V t  = ∑ i = 0  ∞  γ i  η t − i    , where ∑ i = 0  ∞  i γ i   ∣ < ∞   and _t represents the martingale order inconsistency rectified to the description F t  = σ −   pitch η t − i   i ≥ 0    .  3.5 Panel co-integration Using two unique techniques (Pedroni, 2004 ) and (BCS 2009), we analyze the long-term panel cointegration across variables. Pedroni, 2004  test permits panel-specific cointegrating vectors, based on pooling to be known as “across dimensional tests,” while based on group panel stats are regarded as “within dimensional tests.” These statistics are produced by contrasting the H0 of no cointegration links with the H1. This strategy does not take slope heterogeneity or structural break into consideration. Consequently, the third-generation panel cointegration test (Banerjee and Carrion-i-Silvestre, 2017 ) is performed. This approach is a dependable strategy that consistently adjusts for timid and robust CSD, unit root issues, different slope coefficients, and the prediction of erroneous coefficient of determination. The t - statistics are derived using the following generalized model:(6) Y it  = ∂ i  + G t  ´  ∅ i  + ∞ i  D it  + δ it  + X itμi  ´  + D it  X it    ϑ ´  i  + ε it      where Y it    is the resulting factor and X it    is an independent factor; D it  = 1  t > T i      and T i    is the break-year for the single cross-sectional uni; X is the 1st difference. Suppose e it    undergoes the next procedures: ∅ i  L  ∆ ε it  = ρ i  e it − 1   + u it   , where u it    is separately and uniformly dispersed. If ρ i  = 0 , e it    and e it    is cohesive at the 1st difference; at that point, the association between Y it    and X it    is invalid. if ρ i  < 0   cointegration occurs between Y it    and X it   .  3.6 Panel MMQR estimation The current research employed (Machado and Santos Silva, 2019 ) MMQR to investigate the importance of energy transition, eco-policy stringency, green technovation, and primary energy use on CO2 emissions between 1995 and 2019, as well as the interaction between eco-policy stringency*energy transition (INT-1) and eco-policy stringency*green technovation (INT-2), ensuring environmental sustainability in the OECD countries. Conventional panel quantile regression methods may provide reliable predictions of the occurrence of outliers, but they are incapable of identifying the presence of unaccounted heterogeneity across the panel (Zhang et al., 2021 ). This method analyses the result of conditional heterogeneous CO2 variables by forcing the particular impact to ability the overall dispersal rather than only altering the means, as noted by (Galvao, 2009 ) and (Canay, 2011 ) several other researchers. This technique handles the potential of endogenous characteristics in the explained variable, which is an attribute (Wang et al., 2022b ). Moreover, in the nonlinear model, the MMQR approach provides reliable estimates and also offers abundant data for creating non-crossing coefficients in quantile regression. The location-scale variant model's conditional quantile estimations Q y  τ χ    may be expressed as follows:(7) Q y  τ X it   = α i  + δ i  τ    + X it ,  β + Z it ,  γ q  τ      where X it    is a vector of factors that enhanced ET, EPS, GT, INT-1, INT-2, and PEC. As per the assumption, structural quantiles for the predictor variables (CE) are distributed depending on the distribution (location) of exogenous factor Y it   . Individual (i) quantile (τ) fixed effects are denoted by the scalar coefficient signified α i  τ  = α i  + δ i  q τ   . Intercept shift, which, unlike typical fixed least-squares effects, does not represent the distinct influence. These variables are constant with respect to time and have various impacts that may differ besides the conditional distributional quantiles of the endogenous factor (Wen et al., 2023 ). The example quantile indicated by q(τ) may be calculated by solving the accompanying optimization drawback described in eq. (7).(8) min q  ∑ i  ∑ t  ρ τ  R it  − δ it  + Z it  γ  ´    q       Where ρ τ  A  = τ − 1   A 1 A ≤ 0   + TAI A > 0     represents the test function (8); this study applies the resilient technique to heterogeneity and CSD established by (Dumitrescu and Hurlin, 2012 ) to determine causation. This technique integrates thriving for stable data and can be implemented when “T” is > N, and “N”  is > “T” .   4 Empirical findings In this part, the arithmetic findings are discussed by using various approaches. According to Table 1  ‘s descriptive statistics, the mean values of INT-2 and GT are larger than either CE, ET, EPS, INT-1 and PEC. The descriptive study postulates a more in-depth inspection of the variables. Following earlier studies such as (Allard et al., 2018 ; Jahanger et al., 2023 ; Zhang, 2021 ) our study showcases the outcome from the VIF test displays in Table A1   (appendix). Each variable demonstrates a VIF value below 10, indicating the absence of multicollinearity among the variables. Consequently, these factors can be considered autonomous variables believed to impact CO2 emissions. Table 2    summarizes the findings of the CSD investigation. The predictive value of the Pesaran, 2007  test findings rejects the H0 of CSD at a significance level of 1%, showing the existence of CSD concerns in the data. Further, for a more robust outcome, we applied the CSD established by Pesaran (2015)  to determine the existence of shock dependence among the cross-sections. The results of the Pesaran CSD are also shown in Table 2  , demonstrating that there is no CSD in our study of country-specific panel data. Hence, including these CD shocks in the panel's approach is crucial. In addition, the slope homogeneity test was used to validate the results of the CSD test. The outcome revealed a heterogeneous effect as shown below in Table 2  . In comparison, the outcome authorized that OECD has varying degrees of variables. The subsequent step in our study is to confirm that each variable is consistent. The results of the panel unit root test are robust to heterogeneity and CSD and are derived using CIPS and Pesaran's CADF. Table 3    provides the outcomes of CIPS, CADF, and Bai carrion 2009-unit root tests. The CIPS test findings show CE and GT are significant at I(0), but ET, EPS, INT-1, INT-2, and PEC are significant at I(1), respectively. The CADF test results indicate that TI is significant at I(0), whilst the other variables are substantial at I(1). Even the CIPS and CADF investigations suggest that the parameters are stationary at I(0) and I(1), the (BSC 2009) approach is used to validate the parameters. We dissect and prefer the method of integration established using this technique since it is more vigorous in the treatment of CSD, slope heterogeneity, and structural break problems. The statistical implications of the t - statistics through all three approaches confirmed the diverse order at I(0) and I(1). Therefore, non-stationarity is ruled out, asserting variables are mean-regressed. Afterward, completing stationarity of the variables, a cointegration estimation can be performed. Table 4    depicts the examination of panel cointegration established by (Pedroni, 2004 ). The findings of both techniques refute the H0, indicating cointegration among the hypothesized variables. Thus, it is plausible to argue that all variables exhibit long-run relationships. Before estimating the long-run parameter estimates for OECD economies, evidence of long-term cointegrating relationships is necessary. Consequently, we may proceed with more estimations centered on the confirmation of the variables' long-term interactions. Additionally, in Table 5    the third generation (Banerjee and Carrion-i-Silvestre, 2017 ) method indorses the cointegrating relationships for the diverse OECD economies panel, considering CSD, SH, and structural break apprehensions. Nevertheless, country estimations reveal cointegration links with the constant trend. In particular, for constant outcomes, in Austria, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Norway, Poland, Portugal, the Slovak Republic, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States, excluding Australia, Finland, Korea, the Netherlands, and Sweden. In the case of trend, conversely, Australia, the Czech Republic, Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Sweden all showed cointegration throughout the panel. Also, cumulative statistics values in both cases indicated cointegration. The finding, therefore, verifies the presence of long-term relationships. The energy transition is OECD countries' main plan for reducing carbon emissions and climate change, Table 6    presents the MMQR outcomes. Firstly, energy transition  enhances the quality of the environment throughout quantiles. It demonstrates that increasing energy transitions such as wind, thermal, and hydropower diminishes carbon emanations. This shift may cut carbon emissions in OECD countries, which are developed with substantial economic development and industrialization. Renewable energy may decrease dependence on fossil fuels, a significant source of carbon pollution also may enhance energy efficiency by using sophisticated technology/techniques and switching to renewable energy sources. Buildings, appliances, and transportation systems that use less energy may cut carbon emissions and everyday energy use. They believe the energy transition will support them to boost the oil price situation; consequently, the energy transition must be supported (Hu et al., 2022 ). Further, the outcome suggests that the transition toward (renewable energy) in developing nations enhances environmental prominence; consequently, OECD nations must take initiatives to upsurge the ratio of RE in their energy portfolios. Our findings are similar to those (Bildirici and Gokmenoglu, 2020 ; Kirikkaleli et al., 2023b ; Xu et al., 2023a ); they highlighted the significance of stabilizing energy generation from renewable sources. Therefore, the result proposes that transitioning from more polluting energy to less polluting energy would be crucial for achieving sustainable development objectives. Stringency is the degree to which environmental rules impose an explicit or implicit cost on polluting or ecologically damaging behavior. The eco-policy stringency  (EPS) coefficient is positive and substantial in all quantiles. Infers a 1% rise in EPS rises carbon emission. EPS is unlikely to raise OECD carbon emissions, while environmental policies decrease greenhouse emissions. It infers that strict environmental roles may not help to improve environmental quality. Environmental laws and perks often promote cleaner technologies and practices like renewable energy, energy efficiency, and emissions diminution, however, a friendly, viable, and easily adoptable policy can contribute to changing public/industrial behavior toward a sustainable economy and environment. Stringent environmental rules may raise regulatory compliance costs, but the long-term benefits may surpass these costs. Studies have proven that environmental regulations promote economic performance and encourage cleaner technology and behaviors (Radulescu et al., 2017 ). Therefore, environmental policy stringency is more likely to reduce carbon emissions in OECD nations than increase them. The outcome is consistent with (Sadik-Zada and Ferrari, 2020 ) reported carbon leakage due to strict environmental legislation for OECD countries, while inconsistent (Ahmed and Ahmed, 2018 ) stated that strict environmental measures minimize CO2 emissions in China. This study extends the results to attain carbon neutrality via green  technovation (GT) . Henceforth, it can be shown that GT positively affects CO2 emissions in lower quantiles. The table demonstrates that the increase in GT rises CO2 substantially from (10th to 30th) quantiles. The remaining quantiles, however, were deemed negligible. The temporary increase in CO2 emissions in lower quantiles due to an increase in green technovation could be attributed to transitional effects, initial infrastructure development, or the coexistence of older and newer technologies during the early stages of economic growth. Over time, as economies mature and these technologies become more widespread and efficient, they are expected to play a crucial role in mitigating emissions and promoting sustainable economic growth. Although technological advancement might occasionally result in greater carbon emissions, this is not always the case (Udeagha and Breitenbach, 2023c ). The effect of technological innovation on carbon emissions is determined by the kind of technology created and how it is deployed. For instance, if a novel technology that tends to minimize energy use or transitions to cleaner energy sources is produced, it may cut carbon emissions (Zheng et al., 2022 ). Therefore, technological progress has the potential to increase carbon emissions, but this is not a certain consequence (Udeagha and Ngepah, 2022b ). Technological innovation may be leveraged to assist solve the problem of climate change with the correct policies and incentives. Consequently, the nation pays additional attention to developing and investing in low-carbon technology. Moreover, these states' technical progress initiatives need more R&D spending to produce low-carbon technology. The outcomes are supported by (Udeagha and Ngepah, 2020 ; Yu and Du, 2019 ) while fickle with prior studies in literature, such as (Abbasi et al., 2021 ; Udeagha and Ngepah, 2021a ). On the other hand, the interaction between eco-policy stringency  and the energy transition  (INT-1) has a favorable effect on the rise of CO2 emissions, with average growth rates of 0.01 and 0.02% for the lowest, middle, and higher quantiles, respectively. The interaction of EPS and ET might have complicated consequences for CO2 emissions in OECD countries. Also, redirecting efforts toward renewable or cleaner energy alternatives might help sustain economic growth while mitigating the negative environmental effects associated with increased carbon emissions. On the one side, EPS may assist to stimulate the use of greener energy sources and technologies, which can result in lower CO2 emissions. On the other side, in certain circumstances, the energy shift might result in a rise in CO2 emissions, especially in the early phases of the transition (Wolde-Rufael and Weldemeskel, 2020 ). This is because the energy transition involves a shift away from traditional fossil fuel sources of energy, which may result in a temporary increase in emissions as new infrastructure and technologies are developed and deployed (Udeagha and Breitenbach, 2023d ). For example, the creation of renewable energy technology like solar panels and wind turbines might include carbon-intensive operations like material processing and shipping (Shahzad et al., 2021 ). The effectiveness of environmental policy in reducing CO2 emissions during the energy transition is determined by several factors, including policy design, technology types promoted, and the overall economic and political context. In certain circumstances, environmental policies may need to be altered or enhanced to achieve their intended aims. Overall, when designing policies to reduce CO2 emissions in OECD countries, policymakers must consider the interaction between eco-policy stringency and the energy transition. It may be possible to achieve a successful energy transition while also reducing CO2 emissions by carefully balancing the promotion of cleaner energy sources and technologies with appropriate policy incentives and regulations. During the COP26 Summit, OECD officials underlined this point (Hu et al., 2022 ). However, eco-policy stringency  and the interaction between green technovation   (INT-2) confirm that a rise in INT-2 declines CO2 emissions. It may infer that stringent regulations with technology utilization help to cut carbon emissions in OECD nations. Generally, strict environmental regulations may spur the development of cleaner, more effective technologies that lower CO2 emissions. Yet, since it relies on some variables, including the innovation's nature, how it is implemented, and the wider economic and regulatory environment, the effect of TI on CO2 emissions may be complicated. For instance, the execution of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies or the integration of renewable energy technologies like wind and solar power can reduce CO2 emissions from the production of electricity. Similar technological advancements can lower energy use and related emissions in industry, transportation, and energy-efficient buildings (Cheng et al., 2021 ). The effect of technological advancement on CO2 emissions, however, is not always clear-cut. When technical advancements encourage more energy use or when they are introduced without the proper rules or incentives to guarantee that they are utilized in a low-carbon fashion, they may sometimes result in a rise in emissions (Udeagha and Ngepah, 2022c ). This policy debate, nevertheless, also relies on mobilizing financial resources to support this change. With the failure of states to comply with the $100 billion climate finance commitment, the COP26 Summit was particularly worried about the funding of climate measures (Timperley, 2021 ). An important factor in OECD countries' and the world's carbon emissions is primary energy use. This is due to the fact that the majority of main energy sources, such as fossil fuels emit carbon dioxide when they are burnt to produce energy. Because of this, rising primary energy use often causes rising carbon emissions. Lastly , the primary energy consumption  (PEC) coefficient found to be positive and significant in the middle and higher quantiles. This implies that a 1% rise in PEC rises carbon emissions. For long-term sustainability, balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability becomes crucial. Addressing the positive relationship between PEC and carbon emissions in higher quantiles might involve long-term strategies focused on sustainable development, reducing dependency on fossil fuels, and adopting greener technologies to achieve a more sustainable economic trajectory. For instance, it would be feasible to reduce the rise in carbon emissions if an OECD country raises its PEC by creating new energy infrastructure and systems that depend on safer and more effective technologies, including nuclear or renewable energy. The use of low-carbon energy sources and techniques may also be encouraged or mandated, which can aid in lowering the primary energy sector's carbon intensity. The result corroborates (Kirikkaleli et al., 2023a ; Ning et al., 2023 ; Udeagha and Breitenbach, 2023e ) while contradicts (Wahab et al., 2020 ) energy production is inversely related to carbon dioxide emissions. The result will assist OECD countries in achieving SDG 7 and SDG 13 goals. In Appendix Fig. A1, a visual representation illustrates the coefficients of the explanatory variables across heterogeneous quantiles. 4.1 Robustness test Table 7    lists three distinct panel estimate techniques (FMOLS, DOLS, and FE-OLS). These techniques deliver almost indistinguishable coefficient values. The results indicate that GT, INT-1, and PEC substantially affect CO2 emissions. A 1% increase in GT, INT-1, and PEC enhances CO2 emissions in the case of FMOLS, DOLS, and FE-OLS. In addition, ET and INT-2 have an inverse and significant effect on CO2 emissions, indicating that a 1% upsurge in ET and INT-2 reduces carbon emissions. The outcome aligns with (Li et al., 2023 ; Wang et al., 2022a ) while, inconsistent (Udeagha and Ngepah, 2023e ) claimed that, technological innovation decrease in pollutant emissions.  4.2 Heterogeneous panel causality test We discovered that MMQR depicts relationships between variables in various quantiles; however, these findings do not give a pathway for a causal association. To design suitable strategies, it is crucial to comprehend the pathways of these interconnections. Due to the CSD among the variables, we may apply standard causality methodologies, including the causality test developed by (Dumitrescu and Hurlin, 2012 ), to investigate the causal connection. This test accommodates heterogeneity in panel data and establishes causality by applying separate regressions for each cross-section database, in contrast to prior panel causality tests. Moreover, W-bar applies to average stats, and Z -bar stats, which depict a typical normal distribution, are employed to assess the significance of the causation (Hu et al., 2023 ; Udeagha and Muchapondwa, 2023d ). According to Table 8   , the Granger Causality test, ET, EPS, GT, INT-1, INT-2, and PEC strongly influence CE in OECD countries. The results reveal that ET, EPS, GT, INT-2, and PEC have a bidirectional causal influence on carbon emissions, but INT-1 has a unidirectional causal relationship with carbon emissions. The results support (Dar et al., 2022 ; Zhao et al., 2022b ), consequently, the contradictory results are particularly useful for OECD policymakers in devising concrete policies to curb CO2 emissions.   5 Conclusion and policy implications This study contributes significantly to the environmental and energy literature by examining the intricate relationships among energy transition, eco-policy stringency, technovation, and primary energy usage within OECD countries spanning the period from 1995 to 2019. The empirical analysis, employing a range of rigorous panel estimating methodologies and robustness tests, underscores pivotal insights. Stationarity tests confirmed series stability at first difference, while co-integration tests validated the interconnectedness among the researched variables. The findings revealed noteworthy patterns: a negative and substantial impact of energy transition (ET) on CO2 emissions across various quantiles, signifying reduced emissions with enhanced energy transition. Conversely, eco-policy stringency (EPS) and primary energy consumption (PEC) exhibited a positive and significant influence on environmental factors across different quantiles. Furthermore, the interaction between eco-policy and energy transition indicated a positive and substantial association, pointing toward an expansion in carbon emissions within OECD countries. Conversely, the interaction between eco-policy stringency and green technovation demonstrated a negative and substantial impact, implying a reduction in environmental degradation. The robustness of these findings was reaffirmed by employing reliable estimators such as FMOLS, DOLS, and FE-OLS, consistently highlighting the trends observed. Specifically, escalating energy transition was linked to reduced pollution, while heightened eco-policy stringency and primary energy consumption intensified carbon emissions. The positive and significant interaction of EPS*ET suggests an expanding carbon footprint within OECD nations, while the negative and substantial interaction of EPS*GT indicates a tangible reduction in environmental contamination. These empirical insights not only contribute substantively to the existing environmental discourse but also emphasize the intricate interplay among energy policies, green technovations, and primary energy consumption in shaping environmental outcomes within OECD economies. 5.1 Policy implications In light of the above findings, some recommendations are suggested as follows: Based on the results indicating the long-term mitigating impacts of energy transition,  here are extended policy recommendations for OECD countries to reduce carbon emissions: Expand the use of renewable energy sources: Increasing the use of renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, hydro, and geothermal power is one of the most effective strategies to decrease carbon emissions. OECD countries may invest in renewable energy infrastructure and provide incentives for individuals and companies to convert to renewable energy sources. Energy efficiency methods may assist minimize energy use and emissions. Building rules and regulations may be implemented by OECD countries to guarantee that new buildings are planned with energy efficiency in mind, as well as incentives for energy-efficient modifications to existing structures. Provide funds for the advancement of renewable energy technology research and development in order to spur industry innovation and boost productivity. Launch extensive renewable energy-focused public infrastructure projects, such as the construction of wind turbines, hydropower facilities, and solar farms. The interaction between eco-policy  rigor and green technovation  has the potential to be crucial in lowering carbon emissions in OECD nations. Here are some suggestions about how to do this: Encouraging renewable energy technologies: Transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources is one of the most effective strategies to minimize carbon emissions. Environmental policies may help to promote the development and use of renewable energy technologies such as wind, solar, and hydropower. Provide forums or networks where OECD countries may exchange successful case studies, best practices, and technical developments related to green innovation. Global Partnerships: Promote cross-border cooperation and knowledge-exchange programs across OECD nations to take use of varied skills and experiences in advancing green technology for emissions reduction. Overall, the coupling between eco-policy rigor and green technovation has the potential to generate a virtuous cycle that leads to lower carbon emissions in OECD nations. Governments and companies may collaborate to create a more sustainable and low-carbon future by fostering renewable energy, energy efficiency, low-carbon innovation, and CCS technology. The policymakers should consider the energy market to achieve the net-zero emissions committed at COP-26. On the other hand, Primary energy use  and eco-policy  stringency in OECD countries may both influence CO2 emissions. Several suggestions on how these variables can lead to growing pollutant emissions: Increase in primary energy consumption raises CO2 emissions in OECD countries. As the economy rises, so does the need for energy, resulting in increased CO2 emissions. To minimize CO2 emissions, governments should stimulate the shift to greener energy sources such as renewables. Yet, if correct rules are not in place, an increase in primary energy use might increase CO2 emissions. Poor eco-policy stringency: Weak environmental policies in OECD countries may lead to increased CO2 emissions. Businesses may prioritize profitability above decreasing their environmental effect in the absence of stringent emissions legislation. Governments may create laws that encourage corporations to adopt more environmentally friendly practices, such as carbon pricing, emissions trading, or regulating emissions from industry and transportation. CO2 emissions are projected to rise further if these rules are not implemented. In order to lower total energy usage and the resulting emissions, implement comprehensive energy efficiency initiatives aimed at the transportation, residential, and industrial sectors. Preservation Techniques: Promote conservation initiatives, such as encouraging energy-efficient behaviors, streamlining industrial processes, and reducing waste across all industries. Finally, in OECD countries, a lack of public awareness can contribute to rising CO2 emissions. Individuals may not take action to lower their carbon footprint if they do not understand the effect of their everyday activities on the environment.  5.2 Limitation and future direction While our study focused on SDGs 7 and 13 regarding CO2 emissions in OECD countries, it overlooked micro-level measures like carbon efficiency and emission intensity. Future research should explore these indicators for a more detailed understanding. Additionally, expanding research to examine regional differences and the influence of diverse variables across geographical areas within the OECD could offer valuable insights for more targeted policy recommendations and a deeper understanding of environmental dynamics. These directions could enhance future studies and provide more specific guidance for policymakers aiming to achieve sustainable development goals.
