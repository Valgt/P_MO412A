                  Urban areas' performance in water, energy, infrastructure, and socio-economic sectors is intertwined and measurable through Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 6–13. Effective synergy among these is critical for sustainability. This study constructs an indicator framework that reflects progress towards these urban SDGs in China. Findings indicate underperformance in SDGs 8–11, suggesting the need for transformative actions. Through network analysis, the research reveals complementarities among these SDGs. Notably, the SDG space divides into socio-economic and ecological clusters, with SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) central to both. Additionally, SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) and SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) act as bridges, while greater synergies exist between SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG 13 (Climate Action). An in-depth view at the indicator-level shows a core-periphery structure, emphasizing indicators like SDG 6.2 (Wastewater Treatment Rate) and SDG 6.6 (Recycled Water Production Capacity per capita) as pivotal. This study confirms the urban SDG space's stability and predictiveness, underscoring its value in steering well-aligned policy decisions for sustainable growth.

Urban areas' performance in water, energy, infrastructure, and socio-economic sectors is intertwined and measurable through Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 6–13. Effective synergy among these is critical for sustainability. This study constructs an indicator framework that reflects progress towards these urban SDGs in China. Findings indicate underperformance in SDGs 8–11, suggesting the need for transformative actions. Through network analysis, the research reveals complementarities among these SDGs. Notably, the SDG space divides into socio-economic and ecological clusters, with SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) central to both. Additionally, SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) and SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) act as bridges, while greater synergies exist between SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG 13 (Climate Action). An in-depth view at the indicator-level shows a core-periphery structure, emphasizing indicators like SDG 6.2 (Wastewater Treatment Rate) and SDG 6.6 (Recycled Water Production Capacity per capita) as pivotal. This study confirms the urban SDG space's stability and predictiveness, underscoring its value in steering well-aligned policy decisions for sustainable growth.   Keywords Sustainable development goals  Synergy  Urban development  Policy decisions    Introduction Cities, as dynamic conglomerates of people, socioeconomic activities, infrastructure, and resources, are identified as the core of achieving sustainability (Vergragt et al., 2016 ). The accelerating urbanization process, especially in developing countries, has intensified social and environmental challenges, including the strain on water resources (Koop and van Leeuwen, 2017 ; Nieuwenhuis et al., 2021 ), energy consumption (Han et al., 2022 ; Wang and Yang, 2019 ), carbon emission (Sun and Huang, 2020 ; Zhang et al., 2019 ), infrastructure expansion (Muñoz and Cohen, 2016 ) and inequality (Pandey et al., 2022 ). Solving these urgent problems requires innovative and holistic approaches to plan urban development, meeting the resource demands of a growing population while protecting ecological integrity. Essential resources like water and energy are critical for socioeconomic development, and they interact with the society primarily through the network of urban infrastructure. Understanding the intricate relationship between the various objectives for sustainability can better inform management and enhance the efficiency of integrated resource management. The 17 SDGs proposed by the 2030 agenda of the United Nations, covering economic development, social progress and environmental conservation, seek to guarantee the rights and well-being of humanity on a planetary scale (United Nations, 2015 ). A city's performance in the areas of water, energy, infrastructure, and society can be measured by SDGs 6–13. SDG 6 pertains to water, SDG 7 focuses on energy, SDG 11 is related to infrastructure and directly reflects the city's significance in sustainability, and SDG 13 involves climate action. The remaining four SDGs are closely linked to socio-economic factors. The achievement of one goal can yield positive contributions (synergy) or exert negative effects (trade-off) on other goals (Nilsson et al., 2016 ; Pradhan et al., 2017 ; Fu et al., 2019 ). Effectively attaining sustainable development hinges on the strategic maximization of synergies and the prudent minimization of trade-offs. Measuring SDG progress, assessing their interactions, and identifying development priorities are essential for formulating urban development policies. Frameworks for evaluating sustainable development have been widely established. Among them, indicators enable the assessment of progress towards SDGs across space and time (Klopp and Petretta, 2017 ). While consensus has been forming regarding the SDG indicator framework at national and sub-national levels (Xu et al., 2020 ; Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017 ), it remains an intricate challenge at the city level due to the sheer multitude of cities, data continuity issues, and disparities in statistical standards. Sun et al. (2017)  designed a 22-indicator system to assess cities’ sustainable development for the economy, society, and ecological infrastructure in China. Yang et al. (2017)  chose 10 dimensional indexes to reflect urban sustainable development considering residents, ecology and society. Urban footprints such as ecological footprints, water footprints, and social footprints (Wiedmann and Allen, 2021 ; Sørup et al., 2020 ; Shittu, 2020 ) are also used for monitoring and evaluating the SDGs. Besides, studies have been conducted on the comprehensive evaluation of SDGs as a policy tool to enhance the understanding of cities. The SDSN evaluates the 15 SDG index of 105 US cities and 45 European cities (SDSN, 2019a , 2019b ). Xiao et al. (2022)  and Liu et al. (2023)  developed a set of indicators to assess the SDG index for the 17 SDGs in most Chinese cities. However, none of these indicator frameworks eliminates the impact of scale, which is the primary determinant of most urban characteristics (Bettencourt and West, 2010 ). Neglecting to consider the influence of urban scale may result in inaccurate evaluations of urban sustainability. For instance, larger cities often exhibit greater economic aggregates and resource utilization, but this does not inherently imply sustainable performance in these domains. What's more, as a given city urbanizes and its population increases, the growth of its characteristics may be non-linear, but the indicator scores are calculated as linear, which can also lead to erroneous assessments of urban SDG progress. SDG interactions differ across sectors and evolve during sustainable development, challenging policy effectiveness and coherence. Network analysis, integrated assessment models, and scoring techniques are the most commonly used methodologies for analyzing interactions among SDGs (Horvath et al., 2022 ). Nilsson et al. (2016)  proposed the ICSU scale, a seven-point scale of SDG interactions, to highlight priorities. Allen (Allen et al., 2019 ) applied the Nilsson scale to evaluate key target-level interactions based on the scientific literature and expert judgment. The scoring technique is intuitive and easy to replicate but somewhat subjective. Integrated assessment models excel in encompassing interactions between human and natural systems and effectively capturing uncertainty, but have difficulty analyzing multiple SDGs and adequately assessing priorities. The water-energy (Dai et al., 2018 ; Kyle et al., 2021 ), water-energy-food (Albrecht et al., 2018 ), and food-water-land-ecosystems (Kebede et al., 2021 ) nexuses, which are fundamental for some of the SDGs, are assessed by applying integrated assessment models. Liu et al. (2021)  employed the AIM/CGE model to identify the co-benefits of socioeconomic conditions and climate action with other SDGs related to resources. SDGs and their indicators form intricate networks. Leveraging network analysis, Le Blanc (2015)  quantified inter-field linkages among SDGs, identifying SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) as pivotal connectors. This approach has since informed the integration of network analysis with matrix link identification to study SDG interactions. The Pearson correlation coefficients of SDGs have been calculated as links for network analysis to reveal changes in SDG interactions (Wu et al., 2022 ) and prioritized SDGs (Huan et al., 2023a , 2023b ). Weitz et al. (2018)  and Allen et al. (2019)  compared cross-impact matrix and network analysis, identifying the core indicators based on the scoring framework. Huan and Zhu (2022)  combined a literature review and the Nilsson scale to obtain interactions between SDG 15 (Life on Hand) and other SDGs, then conducted network analysis. Xiao et al. (2023)  proposed a plus-minus decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory model to measure direct and indirect interactions. Network analysis outcomes depend on both the indicator framework and the method used to evaluate interactions. While previous research has analysed these interactions, they have not focused on understanding the complementarities among goals. Determining which goals or indicators should take precedence to foster the development of others within the SDG synergy network is essential. Furthermore, prior studies did not consider the indicator framework explicitly designed for the water-energy-infrastructure-society nexus in China. To address these challenges, we developed an indicator system that considers urban scaling and introduced a network termed the 'SDG space' to measure the complementarities among SDGs. The study seeks to answer four pivotal questions: How have urban SDGs 6–13 progressed in China? What is the complementarity between SDGs related to water, energy, infrastructure, and society at the city level? Is the 'SDG space' framework more robust compared to traditional correlation networks? And how can the insights from the 'SDG space' shape urban sustainable development policy-making?  1 Materials and methods 1.1 Indicator design and score calculation We devise an indicator system for SDGs 6–13 that considers urban scale effects, drawing upon our previous study (Zhou et al., 2022 ). Moreover, we take into account the temporal evolution of the metrics from 2010 to 2020. By adhering to the principle of achieving high data coverage while maintaining strong alignment with the goals, we replace certain indicators and finally collect data encompassing 46 indicators (A1) across 297 cities. The data sources for the studies are meticulously detailed within the supplementary information. Indicators include positive and negative indicators, denoted by +1 and −1 respectively. A higher value assigned to a positive indicator signifies a higher level of sustainable urban development, whereas the opposite holds true for negative indicators. The indicator values are then normalized to obtain indicator scores from 0 to 100. We supplement positive indicator normalization methods proposed by the 2018 SDG Index and Dash-boards Report with the negative indicator dequantization method (SDSN, 2018 ). The scores of positive indicators S+  and negative indicators S−  are defined as follows,(1) S  +  = I − l o w e r   b o u n d  u p p e r   b o u n d − l o w e r   b o u n d       (2) S  −  = u p p e r   b o u n d − I  u p p e r   b o u n d − l o w e r   b o u n d       where, I  is the original value of each indicator. We use absolute quantitative thresholds for some indicators, i.e., 0 as the lower bound and 100 as the upper bound, considering the 2023 Agenda for Sustainable Development's emphasis on “full coverage” and the “leave no one behind” perspective. These indicators consist of the water coverage rate (per capital), wastewater treatment rate (per capital), gas coverage rate (per capita), and industrial solid waste utilization rate. For other indicators, due to the difficulty of directly referring to the internationally recommended standard, the average of the top 5 cities among the 297 cities in 2015 was selected as the upper bound, while the average of the bottom 5 cities as the lowest bound. As the score value increases, there is a corresponding rise in the degree of sustainable development. The city-level SDG index scores are obtained by calculating the arithmetic average of the indicators (SDSN, 2018 ). Each indicator within the goal is assigned equal weight to ensure a holistic assessment of sustainable development achievements. The goal-level and indicator-level scores serve as critical criteria for measuring the progress of sustainable development across Chinese cities.  1.2 Construction and visualization of city-level SDG space Product space theory (Hidalgo et al., 2007 ) presents a network that reveals the interconnectedness between products based on the revealed comparative advantages of products. Proximity in product space assesses the resemblance in the productive capabilities (such as labor, infrastructure, natural resources, etc.) needed to produce two products within a specified region. The concept of proximity in product space can be extended to measure the complementaries between SDGs, reflecting the similarity of the external resources required to achieve them. Elevated levels of proximity between pairs of SDGs signify a greater likeness in terms of the necessary external resources, such as capital input and technological innovation, which facilitates the migration of resources and the expansion of efforts to advance these SDGs. As a set of proximity levels between goals/indicators, SDG space enables us to integrate and quantify the complementarities among SDGs, while also capturing the dynamic evolution trends. This outcome-oriented approach to measuring the relationship between SDGs can effectively avoid subjectivity. The proximity between two goals/indicators p(s, s’)  can be obtained as follows,(3) p ( s , s ′  )   ≡  min { P ( R C A ( c , s )  > 1 | R C A ( c , s ′  )  > 1 )  ,      P ( R C A ( c , s ′  )  > 1 | R C A ( c , s )  > 1 ) }     =  ∑ c  I ( R C A ( c , s )  > 1 | R C A ( c , s ′  )  > 1 )   max { ∑ c  I ( R C A ( c , s )  > 1 )  , ∑ c  I ( R C A ( c , s ′  )  > 1 )   }          where, RCA(c,s)  is the revealed comparative advantage of city c  in achieving goal/indicator s, c ’ and s ’ stand for all cities and goals/indicators studied respectively. I (·) is the indicator function, which serves as a binary operator that evaluates a given input statement and yields 1 if the statement holds true, and 0 otherwise. The Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) evaluates whether the goal/indicator s  of city c  exhibits a comparative advantage when compared to all cities in a given period and the extent of this comparative advantage.(4) R C A ( c , s )  = x ( c , s )  / ∑ s ′   x ( c , s ′  )    ∑ c  ′   x ( c  ′  , s )   / ∑ c ′  , s ′    x ( c ′  , s ′  )         where, x(c,s)  is the score of goal/indicator s  for city c . RCA > 1 indicates the presence of comparative advantage. The computed SDG spaces for the goal level and indicator level are 8 × 8 and 46 × 46 matrices, respectively. Each non-diagonal element of the matrix represents the complementarity between a pair of goals/indicators. All calculations are carried out in MATLAB. Then we visualize the SDG space and perform a network analysis on it using Gephi 10.0. The nodes in the network are the goals/indicators and the edges are the proximity between SDGs. In the actual policy discussion, we focus only on synergies with higher proximity, i.e., greater than the mean of the distribution. The Louvain algorithm, the core idea of which is to maximize modularity, is used to discover tightly connected sub-networks in the SDG space. Modularity is a constant measure of the quality of cluster partitioning (Newman, 2006 ), defined as the difference between the proportion of edges within the cluster and the probabilistic expectation of a randomly generated equivalent network. Modularity values range from −1 to 1, with higher values indicating that a cluster is more tightly connected internally and more loosely connected externally. The Louvain algorithm, as an unsupervised greedy algorithm, maximizes modularity in two steps (Blondel et al., 2008 ). First, each node is considered as a community, so that the nodes move between the communities; the modularity increment ∆Q is computed, and the maximum increment is used as the community division. Then the obtained communities are used as super-nodes and the previous step is repeated until convergence to obtain the optimal community. Subsequently, we employ the Ulrik Brandes algorithm (Brandes, 2001 ) to compute the betweenness centrality of a goal or indicator in SDG space. Betweenness centrality quantifies the centrality of a node within a network by counting the ratio of shortest paths passing through node n to the total number of shortest paths between nodes. The outcome can be used to identify the core-periphery structure by determining the nodes with high betweenness centrality (core) and those with low betweenness centrality (periphery). The core-periphery structure can help us understand the dynamics of a network and identify key nodes (Csermely et al., 2013 ). For the layout of SDG space, we adopt the Fruchterman-Reingold methodology (Fruchterman and Reingold, 1991 ), a force-directed algorithm that underscores complementarity. This algorithm treats the network akin to a physical system, with nodes symbolizing electrons. Each node is subjected to repulsive forces emanating from other nodes while concurrently experiencing attractive forces from connecting edges. Within this construct, the algorithm seeks to achieve equilibrium by minimizing the system's energy while simultaneously ensuring harmony among the forces in play. Consequently, nodes with greater connections or robust guidance tend to gravitate toward the nucleus of the network, whereas those less endowed are relegated toward the periphery.  1.3 Verifying robustness of the SDG 6–13 space To confirm the robustness of the SDG space, we conduct a comparative analysis of the temporal stability between SDG space and the correlation network commonly employed. We calculate the Pearson correlation coefficients (Pearson, 1920 ) for each pair of goals/indicators, thereby establishing the correlation networks of 2010, 2015, and 2020. Subsequently, we quantify the goal-level and indicator-level network difference between the years 2010 and 2020, as well as 2015 and 2020, through a matrix norm approach. As illustrative instances, we calculate the difference matrix norm between the networks of 2010 and 2020. This value is then divided by the matrix norm of the 2020 network, enabling normalization of the difference for further interpretation. The equation is as follows,(5) Δ  N o r m = N o r m ( N 20  − N 10  ) × 100  N o r m ( N 20  )       where, N  denotes the SDG space/correlation network. A greater value of ∆Norm  indicates a higher degree of matrix variance, signifying a more unstable network. This validation is carried out using the 'norm' function in MATLAB.  1.4 Validating the predictive power of SDG space The SDG space theory posits that SDGs with high level of synergy in the network are more prone to achieve significant advances in the future, which offers valuable guidance for shaping policy initiatives. To evaluate the dynamic predictive capacity of SDG space, we test whether the SDG space in 2010 could effectively forecast the trajectory of SDGs throughout the subsequent decade. We employ traditional statistical regression and machine learning algorithms to assess the association between the growth potential of goals in 2010 (AG10–20 ) and the actual progress observed from 2010 to 2020 (GP2010  ), which can be obtained according to the following formula.(6) G P s , c , 2010   = ∑ s ′  ≠ s   L s ′  , c , 2010   W s ′  c , i , 2010       (7) A G s , c , 10 − 20   = L s , c , 2020   − L s , c , 2010       where, L  represents the score of a sustainable development goal s ’, W  is the proximity between two goals s  and s’ , and c  indicates a city. The growth potential and actual development can be either positive or negative. Classifying our dataset based on growth potential values, we established distinct cohorts encompassing a group with negative growth potential (<0), another featuring positive growth potential (>0), and a comprehensive assemblage inclusive of all data. The process of linear regression was performed independently on each of the three distinct datasets. Each SDG of a given city represents an individual sample within this framework. The regression equation can be expressed as:(8) A G s , c , 10 − 20   = β 0  + β 1  L s , c , 2010   + β 2  G P s , c , 2010        We train a gradient descent model to assess the nonlinear relationship between growth potential in 2010 and actual growth in 2010–2020 for all samples, implemented through the 'fitrensemble' package in Matlab. The hyperparameters of the model are automatically optimized through cross-validation. A partial dependence plot (PDP) is then used to visualize and explain the complex relationship between the two, while keeping the values of other features constant (Jerome, 2001 ). Furthermore, we calculate the growth potential of SDGs 6–13 for all cities based on the SDG space in 2020, which can guide informed decision and strategic planning.   2 Results 2.1 Performance of Chinese cities on SDG 6–13 Overall, Chinese cities performed relatively well (Fig. 1  ) in SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG 13 (Climate Action). It is notable that 79.12% of cities exhibit performance scores exceeding 80 in SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) while 94.61% is observed for SDG 13 (Climate Action). However, Ulanqab and Lvliang achieved notably low scores in SDG 12 (Fig. 1g ), whereas Jiayuguan, Erdos and Hami languished in the depths of underperformance when it came to SDG 13 (Fig. 1h ). Temporal evaluation spanning the years 2015 to 2020 highlights a dynamic trajectory (Fig. 2b  ). During this period, the mean scores of SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) exhibit favorable upward trends. On the contrary, SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) experience pronounced declines, registering substantial decrements of −7.84 and −14.65, respectively. Indeed, the poor performance of SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) in 2020 could have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused disruptions in the supply chain and decreases in exports and investments (Xiao and Su, 2022 ). The U.S.-China trade war also contributed to an economic slowdown in China. Progress in SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) slowed down during this period, mainly due to insufficient policies and investments (IEA, 2023 ). In addition, minor contractions of −1.24, −0.69, and −0.19 can be discerned within the domains of SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG 13 (Climate Action). Cities in the southern regions tend to exhibit superior performance compared to their counterparts in the north. Specifically, the city scores of SDG 6, 8 to 11 exhibit relatively weak correlation with geographical location, whereas the scores of SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) reveal stark differences between the southern and northern domains. Many cities regressed in SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) from 2015 to 2020, with some cities in Shanxi and Hebei province being the most prominent (Appendix A Fig. S2). Changes in the energy structure, such as a shift from coal to renewable energy sources, could have led to temporary disruptions in energy supply and affordability. Among all cities in 2020, Zhuhai (66.59, Guangdong province) achieved the highest average index of SDG 6–13, followed by Dongguan (66.33, Guangdong province), Guangzhou (66.20, Guangdong province), Hefei (65.82, Anhui province), and Xiangtan (64.99, Hunan province). But even these cities face great challenges, particularly in SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). On the flip side, challenges loom larger for certain cities. Lvliang (35.15, Shanxi province), Ulanqab (40.14, Inner Mongolia province), Shuangyashan (42.56, Heilongjiang province), Binzhou (43.44, Shandong province) and Hami (43.99, Xinjiang province) are the five cities with the lowest scores. The quintet of top performers are exclusively situated within the economically thriving southern regions, while the roster of bottom performers is dominated by northern cities reliant on resource-based industries.  2.2 Goal-level and indicator-level SDG space Utilizing the distribution mean of proximity among all goals (0.438) as the cutting point (Appendix A Fig. S3), the constructed SDG space encompasses 6 nodes and 16 edges. Application of the Louvain algorithm to the goal-level SDG space yields a stable division into 2 clusters. The modularity (0.141) is relatively low, indicating a relatively weak community structure, but still more pronounced than a random network. Within-cluster connectivity is relatively higher than random expectations, but the difference between clusters is not significant (Kashtan and Alon, 2005 ). Cluster 1 is primarily oriented towards socioeconomic development, including reducing inequality and fostering economic growth, with an emphasis on sustainable urbanization. Cluster 2 mainly contains the SDGs related to ecological sustainability, with an orientation towards sustainable production, innovation, and clean energy as pivotal drivers. SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) act as crucial bridges that connect the two clusters. The bridge goal has a high betweenness centrality and establish extensive connections with other goals. Access to clean water is essential for human well-being and environmental sustainability. SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) focuses on developing infrastructure, promoting innovation, and fostering sustainable industrialization, emphasizing that economic development must be carried out with consideration for its environmental footprint. SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) is ostensibly less ecologically relevant, but the environmental benefits of crude and intensive forms of economic growth are different. The distribution of nodes in the network appears scattered, without a discernible core-periphery structure. The formation of the core in the future is significantly influenced by SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) and SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure). SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) possesses the highest weighted degree and occupies a central position within the network. SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), with the highest betweenness centrality, indicating the greatest number of shortest paths passing through it, plays a crucial role in the flow of resources between SDGs. SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG 13 (Climate Action) exhibit the highest complementarity with the sole proximity exceeding 0.7, while SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) has the next highest linkage to SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). The indicator-level SDG space represents a detailed and intricate version of the goal-level SDG space, with a similar distribution between the two, and the indicator-level SDG space can provide a deeper understanding of goal-level SDGs and their interaction mechanisms (Fig. 3  ). Visualization of indicator-level SDG space with the distribution mean value (0.435) of proximity (Appendix A Fig. S4) as the cut point produces 2185 edges and 46 nodes. The indicator-level SDG space is stably divided into two clusters with a large modularity of 0.346, indicating a meaningful division of the network into cohesive communities. The detected clusters have a high density of connections internally and fewer connections with nodes outside. The subclusters of indicator-level SDG space exhibit similar characteristics to those of goal-level SDG space, with the red cluster being primarily socio-economically related, the green cluster being mainly ecologically related, and the indicators of bridge goals being dispersed across the two clusters. In contrast, the green cluster of indicator-level SDG space has a distinct core-edge structure. Situated at the epicenter of the core, SDG 6.2 (Wastewater Treatment Rate), SDG 6.4 (Water Use Per GDP) and SDG 12.1 (Industrial Wastewater Discharge) hold prominent positions, characterized by their substantial weighted degree. The red cluster does not have significant core formation, and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) has a greater impact on core formation because its metrics are widely distributed across the clusters with multiple connections. The commonality of SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) as bridges is that their indicators are dispersed in two clusters, with extensive and strong connections to all the other SDGs. Differences exist in the mechanisms by which their bridging roles are formed. For SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), indicator SDG 6.6 (Recycled Water Production Capacity per capital) shows prominent betweenness centrality, while other indicators have small betweenness centrality and are dispersed across the network. However, the indicators of SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) are decentralized at the edge of the network. What's more, a possible explanation given for the absence of a core in indicator-level SDG space compared to goal-level SDG space is that the green cluster core encompasses all the SDGs studied, with close betweenness centrality of indicators. Combined with the goal-level and indicator-level SDG spaces, SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) is essential for the realization of urban sustainability, since SDG 6 exhibits notable betweeness centrality and plays a pivotal bridging role, connecting aspects of water, energy, infrastructure, and socio-economics. Actually, as a mobile resource, water also requires a comprehensive examination (Requejo-Castro et al., 2020 ) of interactions at all scales from city to transboundary. Sustainable cities are poised to assume a essential role in harmonizing climate change mitigation with economic development. The SDG space furnishes us with scientific backing (Fig. 2a ), with particularly conspicuous synergies emerging between SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production). SDG 12 involves using resources efficiently, minimizing waste, and adopting sustainable practices throughout the lifecycle of products and services. These efforts inherently contribute to lowering greenhouse gas emissions, which is key to SDG 13.  2.3 Comparison of the SDG space and other SDG networks We construct the city-level SDG space and correlation network for the years 2010, 2015, and 2020. Then we conduct a comparative analysis of their changes across different temporal intervals (Table 1  ). The change in a network can be measured by the norm of the matrix, representing the temporal difference. This norm for the SDG space, measured at both the goal and indicator levels, exhibits significantly lesser magnitude compared to that observed in the correlation networks, spanning both the 5-year and 10-year periods. The network at goal-level displays greater stability when compared to indicator level, potentially attributed to the aggregation of indicator-level scores for target-level assessment, mitigating the discernible data distinctions. The difference between the indicator and goal level SDG space is smaller than that of the correlation network, again confirming the stability of the SDG space across scales.  2.4 Predictive power of the SDG synergies over future development We use statistical analyses to confirm the predictive capability of the SDG space regarding future SDG progress. Regression results, as depicted in Fig. 4a  , demonstrate that after accounting for the sustainability score, a significant positive correlation emerges between the 2010 growth potential—quantified via the synergies enjoyed by a goal at that time—and the tangible growth experienced from 2010 to 2020. The coefficients for the 2010 SDGs with negative growth potential, positive growth potential, and all network growth potential are 0.06, 0.41, and 0.16 (Appendix A Table S1), respectively, with p-values less than 0.01 that confirm their statistical significance. When the development of a sustainable goal increases by one unit, the goal to which it is linked increases by 0.16 units. At the same time, we use a machine learning approach to assess the nonlinear relationship between development potential and real growth. The partial dependence plot (Fig. 4b ) shows the same result as the traditional regression, i.e., there is a positive correlation between SDG development potential in 2010 and real development in the latter decade at different levels of SDG scores, especially when the SDG development potential is at a high level. Quantitative assessment of the development prospects through the SDG space in 2020 reveals a discernible pattern (Fig. 4c ). Specifically, the growth potential for SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG 13 (Climate Action) are imbued with notable deficiencies, manifested by only 4.14%, 15.17%, 9.66%, and 1.03% of cities experiencing positive growth. More than 80% of cities show positive growth potential on SDGs 8–11, which presents a more sanguine perspective.   3 Discussion Our study evaluates the progress of SDGs 6–13, which relates to the complex system of water, energy, infrastructure, and the society in Chinese cities, and quantifies the complementarities between the many relevant objectives. Specifically, guided by the list of widely recognized SDG indicators and grounded in the contextual nuances specific to China, we create a detailed indicator framework that also considers the urban scaling effect, removing the influence of population size on the assessment of sustainable development. In fact, China's urban indicators basically adhere to urban scaling theory (Qu et al., 2023 ; Zhou et al., 2022 ). Moreover, smaller cities with greater potential for sustainable development (Sun et al., 2017 ) often face resource constraints, hindering their competitiveness in traditional SDG assessment. Eliminating this factor fosters inclusiveness and incentivizes the engagement of smaller and less urbanized cities in sustainable urban development initiatives. We use the SDG space theory to assess complementarities between SDGs and identify the high-leverage SDGs. Such an evaluation serves as a crucial tool for gauging the degree to which one specific goal or indicator influences another. Multifaceted factors intricately interplay in determining the developmental dynamics. The performance and growth potential of SDGs illustrate distinct spatial heterogeneity, which stems from varied resource endowments, socioeconomic development, geopolitics and so on. Meanwhile, disparities in the development potential across distinct SDGs of the same city are markedly conspicuous. It is imperative to emphasize that a city's auspicious development status should not be conflated with a commensurate growth potential, as exemplified by SDG 13 (Climate Action), where a favorable development status does not equate to a sanguine growth potential. The current progress of SDGs, their growth potential, and the intricate inter-SDGs linkages must all be meticulously weighed and factored into the policymaking process by city authorities. Policies can be crafted to capitalize on complementary, allowing that advancements in one goal could spur the development of synergistic goals. The presence of a well-defined core comprising key SDGs, often characterized by high centrality and weighted degree, signifies their pivotal role in driving sustainable development. These SDGs warrant concentrated efforts and resource allocation, creating a multiplier effect that extends to other SDGs. The periphery of SDG space is represented by goals and indicators with lower centrality, which are integral in fostering comprehensive and holistic development and might require targeted interventions. This core-edge interplay serves as a dynamic roadmap for policy strategists. We chose four cities (Zhuhai, rank 1, urbanization ratio = 90.47%; Zigong, rank 97, urbanization ratio = 56.2%; Songyuan, rank 198, urbanization ratio = 47.89%; Lvliang, rank 295, urbanization ratio = 53.31%) with different sustainability performance, and visualize their indicator SDG space (Fig. 5  ). The core indicators of the green cluster in all four cities are well developed. The more sustainability ehancement radiates outward to encompass the peripheral indicators, the more sustainable the city as a whole becomes. This phenomenon provides support for the core-edge development pathway, which deserves further exploration. Moreover, the SDG space of Zhuhai (Fig. 5a ) illustrates that higher urbanization rates can coexist with greater sustainability, albeit with potential for further improvement. Compared to other three cities, Zhuhai possesses well-developed core and bridge indicators. This is inseparable from Zhuhai's development pattern, characterized by the equilibrium between economic growth and environmental preservation with a low environmental degradation index (Wang et al., 2019 ). Take Lvliang (Fig. 5d ), for instance, to demonstrate how SDG space can provide scientific support for actual policy decisions in specific cities. Indicators positioned at the very nucleus of SDGs lay the foundation for a city's entire sustainable development. Among them, two standing at the epicenter sharing profound synergies with other indicators need collective efforts for enhancement: SDG 6.4 (Water use per GDP) and SDG 13.1 (CO2  emission per capital). Coal and iron and steel industries emerge as the stalwart pillars of Lvliang City. These industries comsume copious amounts of energy and water resources in the production process while generating high carbon emissions (Zhang and Xu, 2022 ). Measures including eliminating outdated and excess capacity, embracing advanced coal power technologies, accelerating the utilization of natural gas and hydrogen energy, and strengthening the recycling of wastewater should be implemented to advance SDG 6.4 and SDG 13.1, and thus usher the city toward overall sustainability. Subpar sewage discharge also exists in Lvliang, necessitating heightened surveillance. Indicators SDG 12.2 (Dry Sludge Produced in Wastewater Treatment) and SDG 9.6 (Industrial Solid Waste Utilization Rate) with poor performance also underscore the pressing issues concerning industrial and wastewater treatment. Bridge indicators, particularly those exhibiting high betweenness centrality, are significant for connecting socio-economic and environmental development. However, a notable bottleneck in the advancement of such bridge indicators exists comprising SDG 9.7 (Expenditure on Science and Technology), SDG 6.3 (Wastewater Treatment Plants Capacity), SDG 10.3 (Unemployment Insurance Coverage) and SDG 11.1 (Land Used for Living per capital). Constrained by terrain slopes, geologic hazards, and coal mining, land resources are scarce in Lvliang. Hence, it is imperative to optimiaze building layout and improve building density and quality. The city's relatively modest investment in science and technology can be attributed to low demand for innovation in traditional industries and economic performance. Promoting the development of emerging industries such as big data and new materials, and facilitating the construction of transportation and energy infrastructure are beneficial to economic growth and industrial rationalization. Besides, a lack of statistical data on core indicators SDG 8.3 (GDP Per Employed Person Growth), SDG 12.1 (Industrial Wastewater Discharge), and crucial bridge indicator SDG 6.6 (Recycled Water Production Capacity per capital) hinders progress tracking and informed decision-making, which demand sound data collection and disclosure mechanisms in Lvliang. Moreover, data deficiency hampers our ability to gauge the full scope of SDGs. For instance, when examining SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), data gaps become evident, such as a complete lack of data on energy efficiency and percentage of new energy. We call on cities to build data monitoring facilities and apply big data tools to fill data gaps. By amassing high-quality, reliable data, we can better track progress, identify SDGs in need of targeted interventions, and ultimately accelerate our collective journey toward achieving the urban SDGs and creating more sustainable, equitable, and resilient cities.  4 Conclusions Meeting consistent sustainable development benchmarks across diverse cities in a brief period poses challenges, given the distinct geographical settings, available resources, and historical growth trajectories of each city. Within each urban environment, water, energy, infrastructure, and socioeconomic concerns are interwoven, creating a multifaceted system with city-specific goals. Our study introduces an indicator framework to evaluate China's urban SDGs 6–13 indices and offers an integrated modeling strategy to examine the synergies among SDGs. We construct an ‘SDG space’ at goal-level and indicator-level across 297 cities in China. Futhermore, we use network analysis techniques to detect communities and explore structure features of the SDG space in socio-economic and ecological development. The core-periphery structure of SDG space at indicator-level is also idetified as offering a dynamic road map for sustainability. We verify the robustness of SDG space theory applied to cities using the matrix norm, with increased stability compared to correlation coefficient networks, facilitating consistent policy making. We use traditional statistical regression and machine learning methods to discover that the SDG space exhibits significant predictive powers that can guide further development. The performance, location in SDG space, and complementarity of SDGs are key for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders to formulate balanced and informed policies that consider resources, infrastructure and socio-economics.
