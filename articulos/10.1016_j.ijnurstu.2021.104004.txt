These challenges include those related to poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, peace, and justice (Brolan et al., 2017 ). The nursing profession is concerned with Sustainable Development Goals due to their impact on the health of patients and populations, despite differences in global location and culture. It is important to highlight the contributions of nursing in advancing achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. In addressing the social determinants of health, nurses are uniquely poised to understand the links between wider public health conditions to both individual and population health (Catton, 2019 ). Clinical nurses, nurse educators, and nurse researchers from Latin America have seen first-hand how attainment of these global goals can make a difference in the lives of the people in the region. In addition, global partnerships can enhance professional development and skills of regional nurses, positively influencing the nursing profession. Although individual country progress may vary, our region made significant progress toward achieving many of these goals (Barreto et al., 2012 ; Hafner and Shiffman, 2013 ; Knaul et al., 2013 ; Visovsky et al., 2019 ; TIMMY Global Health, 2019 ; Visovsky and Morrison-Beedy, 2016 ), even though progress varied widely by country. Importantly, however, the global economic crisis of 2008, and the COVID-19 global pandemic may have affected the sustainability of these achievements. For example, although the region has managed to reduce by half the proportion of people suffering from hunger, progress toward poverty reduction has been insufficient. Nursing has been recognized for their crucial role in implementing the priorities envisaged in the Sustainable Development Goals including their efforts to end preventable maternal and child mortality and to improve the health of populations they serve (World Health Organization, 2017 ). Yet nurses are now at a crucial point for reflecting on strengths and lessons learned to optimize their contributions to implementing the Sustainable Development Goals in the region. 1 Strengthening education to ensure an adequate nursing workforce The nursing workforce is critical to attaining the health targets in Sustainable Development Goal 3 (health and well-being). An adequate, well distributed, motivated, and supported health workforce is required for strengthening primary health care in the region. Yet in Latin America, a recent report from the Pan American Health Organization found that the region needs 7.2 million more health workers to meet the healthcare needs of the population—at a minimum (PAHO, 2017 ). Overall, Latin American countries do not produce enough nurses to meet the healthcare needs of the region. Barriers to producing the workforce needs of the region include economic barriers to attaining nursing education, along with gender and class biases. In addition, workforce development depends on an engaged leadership, multisectoral collaboration, and appropriate resources to educate, train, and empower nurses to be in the forefront.  2 Research grounded partnerships Developing research projects into the Sustainable Development Goals will produce nursing evidence that can have an impact in the regional and global policies. Activities to disseminate research evidence and to communicate with potential users on how to adopt/adapt best practice to the local context are highly demanded in the era of evidence-based practice. Implementing evidence-based practice requires practice-based evidence. With their knowledge and hands-on experience, nurses can theorize, hypothesize, structure studies, and collect evidence that leads to improved patient care. The goal of nursing research is to achieve better care standards and applications for patients and families. Hence, the access to research funding is so important. The continuing challenge that remains is access to adequate research funding, and the training opportunities that could benefit developing researchers.  3 Leadership development for a voice in policymaking Leadership development is critical for the development of the profession in the region and to ensure that women's voices are adequately represented at the national level for healthcare decision-making. Within the strategy that is highlighted in the document on the Leadership of Nurses (Kennedy, 2017 ; Ferguson et al., 2016 ), leadership must be exercised in a collaborative way and within the scope of the profession's work. Priority skills for leadership development in our region include understanding political actors and their roles, how to effectively contribute to policymaking, and managing others in ways that promote and support the profession and avoid punitive tactics.  4 Conclusions While many examples of nursing's contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals that encourage education, leadership, and partnership across low and middle income countries, further step can be taken to strengthen Latin American and Caribbean nursing. Recommendations include the testing of innovative strategies to develop nursing and midwifery in Latin America and Caribbean countries, including partnerships that provide articulated pathways for nursing that support career progression. Policies are needed for a flexible and adaptable workforce to ensure that nurses and midwives are being fully and effectively utilized. One means is to ensure nurses have the professional autonomy to practice to the full scope of practice, including the ability to engage in independent practice initiatives with appropriate compensation. To continue Sustainable Development Goals progress in the region, nursing education must be addressed to ensure the curricula addresses the social determinants of health. It is time to work together to maximize the capacities and potentials of nurses and midwives through intra and interprofessional collaborative advocacy-based partnerships, education and continuing professional development to continue to advance the Sustainable Development Goals and initiatives.
