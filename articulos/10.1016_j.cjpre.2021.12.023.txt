                  The lack of funding is one of the most important challenges in achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in African countries. Can foreign direct investment (FDI) from China as an important source of external financing help African countries achieve their SDGs? This study used the panel data random effects model to analyze the influence of China’s direct investment on SDG scores. Then, the study conducted the ordered probit model to examine the influence of FDI from China on the trend of achieving each SDG in Africa, with the SDGs being grouped into social, economic, and environmental dimensions. Results showed that China’s direct investment contributed to the achievement of SDGs in Africa. FDI from China positively influenced the SDG score in general and some of the 17 SDG scores including SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 15 (Life on Land). The relationship between FDI from China and the trends for SDG 7, 8, 9, 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and 14 (Life below Water) was significantly positive. However, the SDG scores above belonged to the economic and environmental dimensions, whereas FDI from China had no significant influence on the social-dimension SDG scores and trends. To further expand the scale of China’s direct investment, more investment scopes, particularly those in the social dimension, should be developed. Moreover, China–Africa cooperation should be deepened to create a good investment environment for the achievement of African countries’ SDGs and to facilitate China’s implementation of promoting the development of developing countries as mentioned in the 2030 Agenda of Sustainable Development and building the China–Africa community with a shared future.

Influence of foreign direct investment from China on achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals in African countries Ye Fang  School of Economics and Finance, Huaqiao University, Quanzhou, 362000, China School of Economics and Finance Huaqiao University Quanzhou 362000 China  School of Economics and Finance, Huaqiao University, Quanzhou, 362000, China     The lack of funding is one of the most important challenges in achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in African countries. Can foreign direct investment (FDI) from China as an important source of external financing help African countries achieve their SDGs? This study used the panel data random effects model to analyze the influence of China’s direct investment on SDG scores. Then, the study conducted the ordered probit model to examine the influence of FDI from China on the trend of achieving each SDG in Africa, with the SDGs being grouped into social, economic, and environmental dimensions. Results showed that China’s direct investment contributed to the achievement of SDGs in Africa. FDI from China positively influenced the SDG score in general and some of the 17 SDG scores including SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 15 (Life on Land). The relationship between FDI from China and the trends for SDG 7, 8, 9, 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and 14 (Life below Water) was significantly positive. However, the SDG scores above belonged to the economic and environmental dimensions, whereas FDI from China had no significant influence on the social-dimension SDG scores and trends. To further expand the scale of China’s direct investment, more investment scopes, particularly those in the social dimension, should be developed. Moreover, China–Africa cooperation should be deepened to create a good investment environment for the achievement of African countries’ SDGs and to facilitate China’s implementation of promoting the development of developing countries as mentioned in the 2030 Agenda of Sustainable Development and building the China–Africa community with a shared future.   Keywords Sustainable Development Goals  Africa  Foreign direct investment  2030 Agenda of Sustainable Development    1 Introduction In 2015, the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which contains 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) covering economic, social, and environmental dimensions. In addition, this 2030 Agenda is committed to eradicating poverty, protecting the planet, and building inclusive, peaceful, and prosperous societies and revitalized global partnership. The achievement of each of the 17 goals requires substantial financial support, particularly the participation of private sectors, including foreign direct investment (FDI). Most African countries are developing countries with a low level of economic development, backward infrastructure, and scarce financial resources. The lack of funding has become the biggest challenge for these countries to achieve SDGs. According to the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), Africa needs to increase its financial resources by approximately US$614 billion to US$638 billion annually to achieve the goals of the 2030 Agenda. Therefore, for African countries, FDI could be one of the important sources of funding to achieve their SDGs. China’s direct investment in Africa has grown rapidly in recent years. As of 2018, China had established 3,680 overseas companies in Africa, and China’s FDI flows to Africa were US$1.438 billion in 2009 and US$3.3 billion in 2018. Moreover, the stock of FDI in Africa was $9.332 billion in 2009 and exceeded $46 billion in 2018, mainly in construction, mining, manufacturing, finance, leasing, and business services industries. Under the framework of the 2030 Agenda of Sustainable Development, can China’s direct investment help African countries achieve the SDGs? Are there differences in China’s FDI influence on the attainability and the trends of those African countries’ SDGs in different aspects, such as society, economy, and environment? How does one deepen China’s direct investment in and cooperation with Africa? To study these questions have important theoretical and practical implications for the achievement of the 2030 SDGs in African countries, China’s implementation of promoting the development of developing countries as mentioned in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and building the China–Africa community with a shared future.  2 Literature review 2.1 Relationship between the 2030 Agenda and other cooperation mechanisms and the sustainable development specific goals With regard to the relationship between the 2030 Agenda and other cooperation mechanisms, Cui (2016)  discussed the mutual promotion of China’s South–South cooperation and the 2030 Agenda. Then, Zhang (2016)  pointed out that the G20 platform will play a leading and complementary role in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. The 2030 Agenda also provides opportunities for the G20 to transform crisis management into long-term governance (Zhu, 2016 ). He (2018)  pointed out that the cooperation between China and Latin America as an extension of the BRI brings strong impetus into the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Concerning the sustainable development specific goals, Martín et al. (2020)  assessed the contribution of nature-based solutions to the SDGs. Miralles-Quirós et al. (2020)  analyzed the investment strategies related to the SDGs using the five-factor Fama-French alphas. Acheampong et al. (2019)  explored Ghana’s potential to attain SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) by assessing its renewable energy potential and pitfalls. Moyer and Hedden (2020)  used scenario analysis to analyze the progress of nine targets related to human development in the SDGs.  2.2 Influence of FDI on sustainable development The relevant literature has studied the influences of FDI on the economy, environment, and poverty reduction of the host country. The research results related to economic effects indicate that FDI has a positive influence on the economic growth of the host country (Reiter and Steensma, 2010 ; Malikane and Chitambara, 2017 ) but may also have a negative influence (Reiter and Steensma, 2010 ; Kardos, 2017). Regarding the influence of FDI on China’s economic growth, Gan and Yin, (2016)  pointed out that FDI significantly promotes China’s economic growth but has a strong time lag effect. Moreover, differences exist in the promotion mechanisms of joint-venture FDI and wholly funded FDI (Jin et al., 2016 ). Sui et al. (2017)  pointed out that China’s FDI has a large proportion of non-patient capital, which is overall detrimental to the quality of economic development. However, Tian et al. (2019)  argued that FDI can improve the quality of China’s economy through competition effects, linkage effects , and imitation effects. Regarding the environmental effects of FDI, some scholars pointed out that developed countries usually transfer their highly polluting enterprises to developing countries. Then, developing countries tend to relax their environmental control on FDI to promote economic growth, leading to environmental deterioration and becoming the “Pollution Havens” for developed countries (Ridzuan et al., 2017 ; Sarkodie et al., 2020 ). Some scholars believed that FDI enterprises bring more advanced pollution control technologies and environmental management systems, which will help improve the environmental quality of the host country, that is, the pollution halo hypothesis (Abdouli and Hammami, 2018 ; Sarkodie and Strezov, 2019 ). Some scholars tested the pollution haven hypothesis (Zhang and Jiang, 2014 ; Liu and Gao, 2019 ) and the pollution halo hypothesis (Huang et al., 2017 ) based on Chinese data. However, the improvement effect of FDI on the environment was positively correlated with the two-way FDI coordinated development and the industrial structure evolution in China (Gong and Liu, 2020 ). FDI usually aggravates pollution in the early stage of economic development and reduces it in the transition period (Huo et al., 2019 ). Regarding the poverty reduction effect of FDI, Dhahri and Omri (2020)  noted that FDI is an effective tool for poverty reduction in developing countries. Among African countries, Cameroon can use FDI as a short-term tool for poverty reduction (Nguea et al., 2020 ). However, in Botswana, the long-term influence of FDI on poverty reduction is not significant (Magombeyi and Odhiambo, 2018 ), and in North Africa, FDI even aggravates poverty when it is measured using the Gini index (Lazreg and Zouari, 2018 ). Some scholars focused on the influence of FDI on SDGs. As an important source of funding, FDI is beneficial for the achievement of SDGs in developing countries (Lagoarde-Segot, 2020 ). Matei and Stanescu (2018)  theoretically analyzed the influence of FDI on sustainable development in the economic, social, and environmental dimensions. Based on the cross-sectional data of African countries in 2018, Aust et al. (2020)  found that FDI is conducive to the achievement of the SDGs in African countries, particularly in infrastructure, clean water, sanitation, and renewable energy areas, but is not conducive to the achievement of the climate action goals.  2.3 China’s FDI in Africa Considerable studies have explored the motivation or influencing factors of China’s FDI in Africa. Bezuidenhout and Kleynhans (2018)  noted that although China’s investment in Africa is biased toward the resource-rich industries, its investment model is not very different from that of other countries. Liu et al. (2017)  pointed out that China’s FDI in Africa is the result of a combination of factors, and resource seeking is not the only motivation. Lu et al. (2018)  analyzed the influences of political risk on FDI measured through different indicators. Li and Li (2017)  pointed out that bilateral leaders’ visits can promote China’s FDI in Africa. Moreover, the promotion effect of African leaders’ visits to China is stronger than that of Chinese leaders’ visits to Africa. From another perspective, Gagne (2018)  emphasized the negative influence of cultural distance on China’s FDI in Africa. Some scholars studied the effect of China’s FDI in Africa on Africa’s economic growth. China’s FDI in Africa can promote Africa’s economic growth (Liu and Ge, 2018 ) and is beneficial for the development of the manufacturing industries in resource-dependent African countries (Zheng et al., 2019 ). However, on the one hand, Martuscelli (2020)  argued that the competition effect from China’s investment may have a negative influence on the already fragile manufacturing industries of African countries. On the other hand, Busse et al. (2016)  pointed out that China’s FDI in Africa has no significant influence on Africa’s economic growth. Ngundu and Ngepah (2019)  showed that FDI from China and other parts of Asia does not significantly affect the growth in sub-Saharan Africa through export upgrading. Sun (2018) 1  1 http://www.cssn.cn/jjx_lljjx_1/lljjx_gd/201811/t20181121_4778939.html .   studied the influence of China’s FDI in Africa on Africa’s environment and found that China and other countries’ FDI have a positive influence on the increase of CO2  emissions in African countries and that the negative influence of China on Africa’s environment is relatively greater.  2.4 Brief review In summary, the existing literature conducted comprehensive and in-depth studies on the relationship between the 2030 Agenda and other cooperation mechanisms,the sustainable development specific goals , and the influences of FDI on the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of the host country. Studies related to China’s FDI in Africa mainly focused on investment motivation and economic effects. Only a few specifically explored the influence of China’s FDI on achieving the 2030 SDGs in African countries. Although Aust et al. (2020)  first analyzed the relationship between FDI and the achievement of the SDGs in African countries, their sample size was small (only involving the cross-sectional data of 44 African countries in 2018). Moreover, they only analyzed the influence of FDI on the SDG score in general, rather than the influences of FDI on the 17 SDG scores in the three dimensions. In view of this, this study empirically analyzed the influence of China’s FDI in Africa on the degree and speed of achieving the SDGs in African countries. The marginal contributions are as follows. First, this study was to examine the relationship between China’s FDI in Africa and the achievement of the 2030 SDGs in African countries. Second, this study used panel data on the SDG scores of African countries to increase the sample size and reflect the dynamic changes of the data. Third, this study compared and analyzed the differences in the influence of China’s FDI on the trend of achieving the 17 SDGs in Africa, with the SDGs being grouped into social, economic, and environmental dimensions. The study aims to provide useful insights for promoting African countries to achieve the 2030 SDGs and building the China–Africa community with a shared future.   3 Africa’s 2030 SDGs and progress The 2030 Agenda has set 17 SDGs and 169 targets from the economic, social, and environmental dimensions, covering poverty and hunger eradication, health and well-being, education and gender equality, water and energy, climate, ecology, and sustainable economic development (Xian et al., 2020 ). Table 1   shows the goals and contents. Exploration and implementation at the national and regional levels are key to achieving the SDGs. Since 2016, regional organizations, including the Asia-Pacific, the European Union, and Africa, have started to formulate sustainable development indicator systems at the regional level and assess the achievement of the SDGs in each region, in accordance with the requirements of the United Nations. Since 2017, African countries have been annually publishing the statistics and monitoring Africa’s progress in achieving the SDGs and their targets. The Sustainable Development Goals Center for Africa (SDGCAfrica) released two versions of the Africa 2030: How Africa Can Achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, in January and November 2017. In 2019, SDGCAfrica released the Africa 2030: Sustainable Development Goals Three-Year Reality Check. In 2018 and 2019, the SDGCAfrica and the UN SDSN jointly released the Africa SDG Index and Dashboards Report. The SDG-related indicator system constructed at the regional level in Africa are the same as the core of the global . However, in terms of the detailed indicators, the system-added indicators adapted to the African context. This phenomenon is reflected in the names of the 17 SDGs in Africa, which are the same as those in the global framework but with differences in the composition of indicators. The SDG index of the relevant report indicates the extent to which the SDGs have been achieved. According to the Africa SDG Index and Dashboards Report in 2019, 34 countries in Africa have achieved more than 50% of the SDGs. Among them, Mauritius, Tunisia, and Algeria ranked the top 3, with achievement degrees of 66.2%, 66.1%, and 65.8%, respectively. Morocco, Cape Verde, and Egypt were next, with achievement degrees of 64.4%, 64.1%, and 63.8%, respectively. Chad and Central Africa had less than 40%, and South Sudan was last at 29.2%.  4 Empirical analysis 4.1 Econometric model According to the existing literature, FDI may influence the sustainable development of the host country in the social, economic, and environmental dimensions. Meanwhile, the achievement of SDGs in a country is often related to its economic development, population density, financial development, institutional quality and educational development (Zafar et al., 2020 ; Aust et al., 2020 ). In view of this, this study constructed an econometric model by integrating the modeling practices of Zafar et al. (2020)  and Aust et al. (2020)  to explore whether China’s FDI in Africa can help African countries to achieve the SDGs.(1) S D G i t   = β 0  + β 1  f d i i t   + β 2  g d p i t   + β 3  p o p d i t   + β 4  f d i t   + β 5  w g i i t   + β 6  e d u i t   + β 7  r e g i o n i  + ε i t       (2) S D G i t   = β 0  + β 1  f d i i t   + β 2  f d i i t  2  + β 3  g d p i t   + β 4  g d p i t  2  + β 5  p o p d i t   + β 6  f d i t   + β 7  w g i i t   + β 8  e d u i t   + β 9  r e g i o n i  + ε i t       (3) P ( t r e n d i t   > j  )  = f ( X i t   β j   )  = exp ( α j  + X i t   β j   )   1 + exp ( α j  + X i t   β j   )     j = 0,1,2,3      Model (1) analyzes the influence of China’s FDI in Africa on the SDG scores of African country i . Among them, SDGit  is the SDG score of African country i  in period t  (the degree to which the goals have been achieved), including the score in general and the 17 scores, denoted by sdg it  , sdg 1it   to sdg 17it  , respectively; fdi it   is China’s FDI in Africa, denoted by the ratio of China’s FDI flows to Africa to its GDP in period t ; gdp it   is the economic growth rate of African country i  in period t . popd it  , fd it  , wgi it  , and edu it   denote the population density, the financial development index, the institutional quality , and the share of government expenditure on education in total government expenditure of African country i  in period t , respectively. Among them, the institutional quality takes the average of the six indicators from the World Bank WGI database, that is, voice and accountability, political stability, regulatory quality, rule of law, government effectiveness, and control of corruption. A higher index value indicates higher institutional quality of the country. region i   is the regional dummy variable, including five dummy variables for Central Africa, East Africa, North Africa, South Africa, and West Africa, which are denoted by region 1i   to region 5i  , respectively. ε it   is the random error term. Model (2) is obtained by adding the squared terms of fdi it   and gdp it   to model (1) to further explore the possible nonlinear characteristics of the influences of fdi it   and gdp it   on the SDG scores of African countries (Zafar et al., 2020 ). The meaning and treatment of the variables are the same as those in model (1). Model (3) is the Ordered Probit (Oprobit) model for analyzing the influence of China’s FDI on the trend of achieving the SDGs in Africa. Among them, trend it   is the trend of achieving the 17 scores and is represented by trend 1it  –trend 17it  , respectively. This variable is an ordinal variable between 0 and 3, which is obtained by converting the color on the dashboards indicating the trend of achieving the SDG scores into a numeric value. The green arrow on the SDG trend dashboards is assigned a value of 3, indicating that the 2030 SDGs is achieved at a higher or required speed. The yellow arrow is assigned a value of 2, indicating that the SDG score is growing at higher than 50% but still slower than the speed required to achieve the 2030 SDGs. Furthermore, the orange arrow is assigned a value of 1, indicating that the speed is stagnant, remaining stagnant or slower than 50% of the speed required. Finally, the red arrow is assigned a value of 0, indicating that the SDG score is declining and the country is moving in the wrong direction in its sustainable development practices. X it   is the matrix of relevant explanatory variables in models (1) and (2).  4.2 Analysis of empirical results The research data cover the time range from 2015 to 2019. Of which, the time range of the SDG scores is from 2016 to 2019, and the time range of the explanatory variables is lagging by one year, from 2015 to 2018. The model related to the SDG scores was analyzed in terms of the SDG scores in general and the 17 SDG scores. Considering the lack of data on education expenditure, the sample was divided into two groups including and excluding education expenditure. The final model of the SDG scores involves two samples containing 44 and 28 African countries. As the sample in this study covers only four years in time series, which is short panel data, and contains regional dummy variables that do not change over time, this paper selected the random effects model for regression. For the trend of achieving the SDG scores in African countries was mentioned only in the Africa SDG Index and Dashboards Report issued in 2018 and 2019, with several missing data. Thus, the data were treated as mixed data and regressed using the Oprobit model. The nonlinear characteristics of the influences of China’s FDI and Africa’s economic growth on the SDG scores are not statistically significan, this paper did not list the related regression results of the 17 scores. This paper only list the regression results of the SDG scores that are significantly influenced by China’s FDI. Table 3  to Table 5      show the final regression results. 4.2.1 Influence of China’s FDI on the general SDG score of African countries The results in Table 3  show that the influence of China’s FDI on Africa’s SDG score in general is positive, and statistically significant at the 5% level in the model with the inclusion of education expenditure. The influence of education expenditure on the SDG score in general is positive but not significant. Among the other control variables, financial development in African countries is conducive to increase their SDG scores, with the correlation coefficient passing the 1% or 5% significance test. The reason is that countries with a higher level of financial development are more likely to receive the financial support needed to achieve the SDGs. Countries with a higher institutional quality are more likely to achieve the SDGs, and the correlation coefficients have passed the significance tests of 1%, 5%, and 1% level in regression models 1–3, respectively, excluding education expenditure. On the contrary, the influences of economic growth and population density on Africa’s SDG scores are not significant. The correlation coefficients of the quadratic terms of China’s FDI and Africa’s economic growth are also not significant. In other words, no significant non-linearity exists in the influences of both on Africa’s SDG scores. Regional differences are found in Africa in the degree of achieving the SDGs. Compared with West African countries, North African countries make faster progress on achieving the SDGs, with correlation coefficients being significant at the 5% or 10% level, but no significant difference exists in other regions.  4.2.2 Influence of China’s FDI on Africa’s 17 SDG scores According to the results in Table 4 , the influence of China’s FDI on Africa’s 17 SDG scores is negative at the 10% significance level for SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), but not significant after including education expenditure. As for the influences of China’s FDI on SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 13 (Climate Action), the correlation coefficients are significantly positive in the regression models excluding or including education expenditure. In other words, China’s FDI helps African countries achieve the goals of accessing affordable and clean energy and taking climate actions. In the sample with the inclusion of education expenditure, China’s FDI is beneficial in raising the scores of African countries for SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), SDG 12 (Sustainable Consumption and Production), and SDG 15 (Life on Land). The correlation coefficients have passed the 5% or 10% level significance test. The influence on the other SDG scores is not significant in both sample groups. In summary, China’s FDI contributes to the achievement of SDGs in Africa in the economic and environmental dimensions but has almost no significant influence on the social-dimension SDG scores. The reason may be related to the fact that, China’s FDI is mainly concentrated on industries related to economic development and environmental improvement in Africa currently, whereas the proportion of investment in health care and education industries is relatively low. The influences of control variables such as economic growth, financial development, institutional quality, and education expenditure in African countries on some of the SDG scores are significantly positive. The influence of population density is not significant. In the sample with the inclusion of education expenditure, regional differences in Africa in the degree of achieving SDG 7, 9, and 15 are observed.  4.2.3 Influences of China’s FDI on the trend of achieving each SDG score in Africa According to the regression results in Table 5 , for the sample excluding or including education expenditure, the influence of China’s FDI on the trend for SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) in Africa is positive and statistically significant at the 5% level . In addition, the influence of China’s FDI on the trend for SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in Africa is significantly positive in the sample excluding education expenditure. The influence of China’s FDI on the trend for SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), and SDG 14 (Life below Water) in Africa is significantly positive in the sample including education expenditure.Similarly,China’s FDI is conducive to increasing the speed of achieving the SDGs in Africa in the economic and environmental dimensions but has no significant influence on the speed of achieving the social-dimension SDGs. The control variables of population density, financial development, institutional quality , and education expenditure in Africa have significantly positive influences on the trend of achieving some of the SDG scores. Regional differences also exist in the speed of achieving SDG 7, 8, and 14.    5 Conclusion and enlightenment This paper addressed the problem of a small sample size of cross-sectional data based on the relevant panel data of African countries from 2015 to 2019. This paper analyzed the influence of China’s FDI on Africa’s SDG scores using the panel data random effects model. Meanwhile, based on the mixed data in 2018 and 2019, this paper used the ordered probit model to explore the influence of China’s FDI on the trend of achieving the SDG scores in Africa. As only two years of data are available on the trend of achieving the SDG scores in Africa with several missing data, the sample size is relatively small and needs to be further expanded in the future. This study discussed whether China’s FDI contributes to the achievement of SDGs in African countries from the social, economic, and environmental dimensions. The main findings of the study are as follows. First, China’s FDI helps African countries achieve some of the SDGs in the economic and environmental dimensions but does not have a significant influence on the progress of achieving the social-dimension SDGs. China’s FDI is conducive to enhancing the overall achievement of the SDGs in Africa. Meanwhile, among the 17 SDGs, the influence of China’s FDI is significantly positive on the degree of achieving SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), and SDG 12 (Sustainable Consumption and Production) in the economic dimension; and SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 15 (Life on Land) in the environmental dimension. Evidently, under the framework of the 2030 Agenda, China’s FDI not only focuses on the sustainable economic growth in Africa but also starts to pay attention to the environmental effects of the investment, thereby exerting a positive influence on the environmental fields, such as the climate action in African countries. However, at present, China’s investment in social sectors such as education and health care is mainly in aid way, the proportion of direct investment dominated by private sectors is still low; thus, the effect of direct investment on the social-dimension SDG has not yet to be seen. Second, China’s FDI is conducive to improving the speed of achieving the SDGs in Africa in the economic and environmental dimensions. However, China’s FDI has no significant influence on the speed of achieving the SDGs in the social dimension. The influence of China’s FDI is significantly positive on the trend of achieving SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and SDG 14 (Life below Water) in Africa. Third, country-specific factors in African countries also have an important influence on their achievement of sustainable development. Control variables such as African countries’ economic growth, financial development, institutional quality , education expenditure, and population density have significantly positive influences on some of the SDG scores and trends. Moreover, regional differences in Africa in the degree and trend of achieving the SDGs are observed. The following insights can be drawn from the findings. First, we should further expand the scale of China’s FDI in Africa. China’s FDI will become an important source of funding for African countries to achieve the 2030 SDGs. The BRI and building the China–Africa community with a shared future provide good opportunities for China’s direct investment in and cooperation with Africa. With these opportunities, enterprises, particularly private ones, are encouraged to actively participate in investing in Africa, further expand the scale of China’s direct investment in Africa while diversifying investment entities, and support African countries in achieving the SDGs. Second, we should expand China’s direct investment areas in Africa, specifically in industries related to the social dimension. Direct investment in Africa can cover education, health care, environmental cooperation, infrastructure, energy cooperation, and other fields related to the achievement of the SDGs in Africa. This investment will help African countries achieve economic growth, increase employment and improve people’s livelihood, and protect the environment and ecological diversity,which will promote the achievement of SDGs in African countries in the economic, social, and environmental dimensions. Third, we should deepen China–Africa cooperation and create a favorable investment environment for China’s FDI enterprises in Africa. Deepening China–Africa cooperation is an important way for China and African countries to achieve the SDGs of “global partnership”. Meanwhile, strengthening the coordination and communication between the Chinese and African countries governments through cooperation, and promoting African countries to improve their laws on China’s direct investment will help improve the business and investment environment for Chinese enterprises in Africa, thereby maximizing the contribution of direct investment to Africa’s SDGs. In addition, African countries should further improve their governance quality, increase education expenditure, and promote financial development to achieve their SDGs.
