                  The material foundation for societal advancement and human survival is energy. The advancement of digitalization has emerged as a brand-new force behind the advancement of society. Scholars from a variety of nations are starting to concentrate on the ways that the growth of digitalization affects social sustainability. However, the impact of digitization on multidimensional energy poverty (MEP) in rural China has not yet been proven. There is no micro-empirical evidence on how the introduction of digitization into MEP contributes to the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). In this study, we construct a multidimensional energy poverty index (MEPI) for rural households in China based on Alkire and Foster's theory, use mixed methods to explore the contribution of each energy poverty dimension to MEP, and empirically test the impact of digital development on the MEP of farm households. Our results show that cultural recreation in rural areas has the highest contribution to MEP. In addition, digital empowerment mitigates MEP, with the largest effect on cultural entertainment but not on household equipment poverty. Based on the empirical results of this paper, we have designed a policy framework for China and other developing countries with similar MEP problems to achieve some of the UN SDGs.

In addition, the reason for selecting the number of people eating at home rather than the total household size as a variable is that rural households in China will have people who often live away from home, and such people will not be the main consumers of energy in the farm household, so we have chosen the number of people eating at home as the NR in the household.

Editor: Prof. Yue-Jun Zhang The material foundation for societal advancement and human survival is energy. The advancement of digitalization has emerged as a brand-new force behind the advancement of society. Scholars from a variety of nations are starting to concentrate on the ways that the growth of digitalization affects social sustainability. However, the impact of digitization on multidimensional energy poverty (MEP) in rural China has not yet been proven. There is no micro-empirical evidence on how the introduction of digitization into MEP contributes to the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). In this study, we construct a multidimensional energy poverty index (MEPI) for rural households in China based on Alkire and Foster's theory, use mixed methods to explore the contribution of each energy poverty dimension to MEP, and empirically test the impact of digital development on the MEP of farm households. Our results show that cultural recreation in rural areas has the highest contribution to MEP. In addition, digital empowerment mitigates MEP, with the largest effect on cultural entertainment but not on household equipment poverty. Based on the empirical results of this paper, we have designed a policy framework for China and other developing countries with similar MEP problems to achieve some of the UN SDGs.

The implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) has become a crucial issue for global development. Human society cannot survive without energy (Tong et al., 2020 ). Solving the global energy crisis is essential to reaching the SDGs. SDG 7 mandates that all nations have modern, clean, dependable, and affordable energy services by 2030 (United Nations, 2015 ). In some parts of the globe, however, modern energy is still a luxury, and energy poverty continues to plague a significant portion of the global population. According to the International Energy Agency's Tracking Sustainable Development Agenda (SDA) 7: Energy Progress Report, close to 70 % of the world's population will have access to clean cooking fuels and technologies by 2020. This represents an increase of nearly 70 million people compared to 2019, but there will still be approximately a third of the population without access to these fuels (IEA, 2020 ; Elavarasan et al., 2021 ). Most energy-poor people live in Asia and Africa, where economic development is lower. Due to the global expansion of COVID-19 and the energy crisis induced by the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, SDG7 will be harder to achieve (Pereira et al., 2022 ). Households in absolute energy poverty often suffer from a variety of illnesses and even mortality because they cannot access or afford clean water and modern fuels. Liao et al. (2021)  claimed that rural households without dependable and clean energy sources are more inclined to use solid fuels for daily home energy. The energy poor's extended use of traditional, non-clean fuels for cooking and heating releases poisonous gases that pollute indoor and outdoor air and harm human health (Haines et al., 2007 ). Energy-poor groups can also contract bacterial diarrhea, viral hepatitis A, and rotavirus enteritis from contaminated water (Anugwom et al., 2020 ). Thus, addressing household absolute energy poverty in each country can promote a healthy lifestyle and improve human well-being. As energy needs diversify, family energy poverty has become more complicated. Some academics have noted that MEP is more effective than absolute energy poverty in revealing the nature of energy poverty (Sinha et al., 2021 ). Absolute energy poverty means not having enough energy for lighting, cooking, and warmth. Absolute energy poverty is evaluated by one energy access or consumption metric (Che et al., 2021 ). This basic method can quickly assess energy poverty, but it ignores other aspects including geography, home structure, and sociocultural background. MEP considers energy availability, price, accessibility, health, and the environment (Qurat-ul-Ann and Mirza, 2021 ). This method requires a lot of data to quantify energy poverty, but it allows for a more comprehensive investigation of its causes and effects. This clarifies how specific energy poverty indicators affect energy poverty (Zhang et al., 2021a, 2021b ). Some households have enough energy yet remain in energy poverty due to excessive energy bills or bad health. MEP can illuminate these issues and provide additional information for improved policies and solutions (Wang and Lin, 2022 ). According to the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (GMPI) 2022 report, understanding how household poverty affects different aspects of people's daily lives, including access to education, health care, and living conditions such as housing, drinking water, sanitation, and electricity (Alkire and Frank, 2022 ). However, this report mainly emphasizes MP but does not refine the specific dimensions of MEP. Therefore, this is what this study needs to focus on. Moreover, China is entering a period of accelerated digital development due to the pervasive development and adoption of digital technology. China's digitalization will reach 3718 billion yuan in 2021, representing 32.5 % of GDP, according to the China Academy of Information and Communication Technology (Wu and Xu, 2023 ). This demonstrates that the advancement of digitalization has become a new motor for society's growth (SDG 9). Regarding the impact of digitalization on rural residents' daily consumption behavior, the prevalence of the internet and mobile phones has significantly contributed to profound changes in rural residents' consumption behavior in China (Du and Lou, 2023 ), especially in terms of the selection of clean fuels, energy consumption patterns, and farm households' energy accessibility (Zhang et al., 2023 ). Ren et al. (2021)  argue that digitalization is in line with the evolutionary direction of the energy revolution, and therefore digital technologies are used to guide energy upgrades and achieve precise matching from the supply side to the consumption side, thereby meeting the energy needs of various groups and regions, constructing a new modern energy system, and ensuring modern energy accessibility, security, and sustainability (SDG 7). Digital technology's rapid rise in China has had a major impact on household energy poverty (Ren et al., 2021 ). Furszyfer Del Rio et al. (2020)  note that with the proliferation of digital home applications, households can intelligently manage and control their energy consumption. Smart meters and energy-saving modes on smart equipment can help households better manage energy use (Ren et al., 2021 ). These smart home applications can boost energy efficiency and minimize household energy burdens, alleviating energy poverty. Rural areas in China are sparsely inhabited and have limited access to fresh knowledge, thus digital technology can give rural households more energy options (Shao, 2022 ). Digital technologies, such as internet education platforms and mobile apps, can provide rural households with more energy knowledge, energy saving techniques, and renewable energy applications, reducing their reliance on traditional energy sources and helping them cope with energy poverty (Hu et al., 2022 ). It is worth noting that although existing studies have pointed out that digitalization can play a role in alleviating household energy poverty in China, most of them have focused on a single dimension of energy poverty and lack empirical exploration of MEP. Considering the current immaturity of indicators for assessing MEP in rural areas of the country and the fact that digital empowerment has not been investigated to determine if it alleviates MEP in rural households. This paper contributes to current research in the following two ways: Firstly, based on the United Nations' sustainable development agenda, this study develops a multidimensional approach to construct the MEPI for rural China in five dimensions: household energy cleanliness, energy demand, energy burden, household equipment, and cultural recreation, and analyzes the contribution of each dimension to the MEP using rural households in China as an example. In addition, a microlevel analysis of MEP in rural households provides a more comprehensive and practical perspective on MEP in rural China. Secondly, this study reveals whether digital empowerment can alleviate MEP among farm households to test the effectiveness of digital technology diffusion policies in addressing energy poverty among rural households in China. The empirical findings of this study inform our approach to designing a policy framework to help China and other developing countries with similar energy poverty problems achieve some of the SDGs. The policy framework designed for this study focuses on helping to achieve affordable, reliable, and sustainable modern energy for all (SDG 7), supporting and strengthening the participation of local communities in improving water security (SDG 6.b), ensuring healthy lifestyles (SDG 3), developing quality, reliable, and sustainable communication technologies, and ensuring equitable access for all (SDG 9.1), ensuring access for all (SDG 4.2), and ensuring access for all (SDG 5.3). access to information on and awareness of sustainable development and harmony between people and nature (SDG 12.8). This policy framework for achieving some of the SDGs through digital empowerment is the main policy contribution of this paper. The research framework for this paper is shown in Fig. 1  . The remainder of the paper is shown below: Section 2  is a review of the relevant literature; Section 3  describes the methodology used in this paper; Section 4  discusses the main results and discussion; and Section 5  gives the conclusions and the policy framework designed in this paper.  2 Literature review 2.1 Definition and situation of energy poverty Energy poverty (EP) is defined differently in developed and developing countries. In developed countries, EP is mainly expressed in terms of unaffordable energy use, and the factors contributing to this type of energy poverty usually consist of three key factors: household energy use efficiency, household income levels, and energy pricing. In developing countries, EP manifests itself as a dual problem of accessibility and affordability of modern energy (González-Eguino, 2015 ). The issue of household energy poverty in developing countries is currently of great academic interest. In addition, from the perspective of rural-urban disparities, there are significant differences in access to clean cooking fuels and technologies between urban and rural households in various countries or regions of the world (Halkos and Gkampoura, 2021 ). According to statistics, 86 % of urban households and 48 % of rural households will have access to clean fuels and technologies in 2020 (Guta et al., 2022 ). China, the world's most populous and resource-rich country, continues to struggle with the availability and affordability of modern clean energy, even though residential electricity services have been comprehensively addressed since the country's reform and opening and the war on poverty. When compared to conventional solid fuels, the usage of modern clean energy is prohibitive for many poor households, particularly those in distant places such as grasslands and mountains, where people are more prepared to spend their leisure time collecting animal dung and wood (Zhang et al., 2021a, 2021b ). According to empirical data (Xie et al., 2022 ), 52.1 % of households in rural China still use traditional stationary fuels for cooking and heating, which is a substantially higher proportion than in urban regions. The overall national incidence of energy poverty is >40 %, with considerable regional variances (Xue and Wu, 2022 ).  2.2 Status of research on multidimensional energy poverty Multidimensional energy poverty (MEP) takes into account not only the clean energy poverty of poor households, but also a number of other factors, such as living conditions, electricity, communication, drinking water, education, transportation, etc., to provide a more complete picture of the actual state of energy poverty in households (Hosan et al., 2023 ). Moreover, the one-dimensional measure of energy poverty, which typically determines whether a household is energy poor by its use of clean fuels or by the fact that it consumes >10 % of its income to maintain a comfortable indoor temperature, is illogical (Boemi and Papadopoulos, 2019 ); for instance, a high share of household energy consumption is not necessarily due to energy poverty, but may be the result of a large household size or wastefulness. In contrast, a household's energy consumption may be lower if it is not connected to the electricity grid or if it lacks modern energy-consuming equipment (e.g., appliances, etc.) (Boemi and Papadopoulos, 2019 ; Sokołowski et al., 2020 ). Therefore, using a multidimensional perspective to measure the current state of household energy poverty can be an effective method to compensate for the inaccuracies and irrationalities associated with a single-dimensional measure. Alkire and Foster (2011)  proposed the Alkire-Foster approach (i.e., the A-F approach) based on previous research as the theoretical and methodological foundation for the empirical measurement of MP. Based on this theoretical approach, Nussbaumer et al. (2012)  discussed the relevant methodologies and initial structures in several African countries and concluded that the majority of existing indicators and composite indicators are focused on assessing energy access or energy-related development level measures. As a result, they pioneered an entirely new indicator based on this: the Multidimensional Energy Poverty Index (MEPI). Since then, numerous researchers have used the MEPI to measure energy poverty in various countries or regions (Pelz et al., 2018 ), but there are issues with the availability of pertinent microdata and the lack of uniformity among the MEPI's indicators. In Table 1  , the study areas and the specific indicators used to construct the MEPI are summarized in the relevant literature. Even though scholars in different countries have begun to construct MEPI based on different dimensions from macro and micro perspectives, the MEPI constructed by scholars lacks a degree of universality due to the differences in geographical environment, economic development level, living habits, and cultural norms between countries. With the introduction of the UN SDGs and China's “peak and neutral carbon” targets, energy and environmental issues have become hot topics of research for Chinese scholars. However, the existing literature on MEP in China still lacks studies on MEP in rural areas. Compared to urban areas, rural households are the focus area for EP, and there is no more generalized MEPI construction for rural areas, so it is necessary to construct MEPI for rural areas in China from a microscopic perspective.  2.3 Factors influencing MEP There are a number of influencing factors that affect MEP. It has been shown that economic level, energy investment effort, energy infrastructure, energy pricing, and factors such as household demographics and the education of the household head can directly affect EP (Guan and Xu, 2015 ; Xue et al., 2014 ). Abbas et al. (2020)  suggest a positive relationship between income poverty and MEP. Based on institutional factors in China, a higher degree of fiscal decentralization and state risk can exacerbate the depth of MEP, while renewable energy and technological innovation can mitigate it (Xia et al., 2022 ). In addition, employment is considered an important factor influencing household energy choices. Compared to agricultural activities, non-farm activities are more likely to contribute to the improvement of household living standards, which in turn enhances the use of modern clean energy, optimizes the energy consumption mix, and mitigates household MEP (Abbas et al., 2020 ). Huang et al. (2021)  confirm this based on empirical analysis. The social security system is an important social factor influencing household MEP. Akter and Bagchi (2021)  argued that factors such as community or village infrastructure, planning situations, and social inequality also exacerbate MEP.   3 Methods 3.1 Method of measuring MEPI Based on Alkire and Foster theory, the A-F method is the most extensively used method for quantifying MP in China. When compared to single-dimensional poverty measures, the A-F method is more comprehensive in reflecting the subject's deprivation of ability in multiple dimensions and has good decomposability, allowing the contribution of different dimensions to MP to be analyzed to obtain a comprehensive poverty index (Zhang and Yang, 2020 ). The following is the exact approach to building the MEPI for rural China utilizing the Alkire-Foster method outlined in this paper:(1) A = a 11   ⋯  a 1 d     ⋮  ⋱  ⋮   a n 1    ⋯  a nd         where:  A denotes the value of all indicators for each individual i  in dimensions 1 to d . The first critical value of Z = [Z1…Zd] is assumed to be the energy poverty line for each dimension. If x ij   <g j   , then each individual i  is in the energy poor group in dimension j , and vice versa for non-poor. In empirical studies, some scholars will convert A into a 0–1 matrix by the double-bounded transformation method for computational convenience (Chen and Ren, 2022 ). The specific conversion formula is shown in (2) below:(2) B = b 11   ⋯  b 1 d     ⋮  ⋱  ⋮   b n 1    ⋯  b nd      , b ij  = 1 , a ij  < g j    0 , a ij  ≥ g j          Based on the above formula, the weights w j    of each indicator are selected to establish a weighted poverty deprivation value matrix C, as shown in Eq. (3) :(3) C = c 11   ⋯  c 1 d     ⋮  ⋱  ⋮   c n 1    ⋯  c nd      , c ij  = b ij  ∗ w j      The MEP deprivation share matrix D can be obtained by comparing the magnitude of the weighted deprivation value established in Eq. (3)  with the threshold k of the MEP (k  takes the values 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, etc.), as shown in Eq. (4) :(4) D = d 1  … d n    T  , d i  = ∑ j = 1  e  c ij  , ∑ j = 1  e  c ij  ≥ k   0 , ∑ j = 1  e  c ij  < k         Finally, the MEP deprivation share value D is used to determine whether a household is an MEP household or not, and finally the MEP matrix Q is obtained, as shown in Eq. (5) :(5) Q = q 1  … q n    T  , q i  = 1 , d i  > 0   0 , d i  = 0         Using the five formulas above, we distinguish between MEP poor and non-poor households and calculate the incidence of MEP [H(k )], MEP deprivation share [A(k )], and MEPI [M(k )] using the following three formulas:(6) H k  = ∑ i = 1  n  q i   n     (7) A k  = ∑ i = 1  n  d i   ∑ i = 1  n  q i  ∗ e      (8) M k  = H k  ∗ A k      3.1.1 Measuring the contribution of different dimensions to MEP The steps outlined above were simply utilized to assess the MEP situation in China's rural areas, and it was not able to determine the exact contribution of each dimension to the MEP. To investigate the location of each dimension pair in the rural MEP further, we employed the MEPI decomposition method in the AF method to dimensionally decompose the MEPI obtained above and obtain the contribution rate of each dimension. This was done in the manner stated in the Eq. (9) .(9) Y j  = z j  / n   ∗ w j    / M k     where : Y j    denotes the contribution of the j th dimension to the MEP and z is the total number of MEP samples identified when the dimensional threshold is k .  3.1.2 Methodology for measuring energy demand Based on the energy demand theory, scholars have shown through their research that the relationship between energy consumption per capita and GDP per capita behaves in a largely consistent manner regardless of national circumstances (Wang and Lin, 2022 ). In addition, Barnes et al. (2011)  argue that, based on the energy consumption framework theory, residential household energy is divided into two stages: the initial stage is regarded as the stage of meeting basic energy needs, in which household energy consumption is not influenced by household income. In the second stage, people's energy needs are increased by the growth of their income. Based on this theory and with reference to previous studies (Wang and Lin, 2022 ), we use an energy demand function to estimate the basic energy demand of farm households, which is shown in the following equation:(10) Ele − N n  / TE − N n  = α + ∑ m  β m  γ nm  + ∑ j = 2  10  δ j  Income nj  + μ n     where: Ele − N n    and TE − N n    represent annual per capita electricity consumption and annual per capita total direct energy consumption (i.e. the sum of per capita water, electricity, fuel and heating bills) for the n th household, respectively, and Income nj    is a dummy variable for household net income stratification (cf. (Wang and Lin, 2022 ), which divides household income into 10 groups). γ nm    is the control variable.   3.2 Data sources and indicator selection 3.2.1 Data sources Given the inadequacy of rural household energy consumption data counted in China's rural statistical yearbooks, actual household energy consumption data is often mismatched with the yearbook statistics. For example, Cheng et al. (2017)  found through microdata from field research that rural households in northern China consumed three times more energy than yearbook statistics. Thus, this paper uses the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) from the China Social Science Survey Centre of Peking University as its main data source and retains data from two periods of rural households in 2014 and 2018 through screening. The advantages of selecting this dataset are as follows: (1) The survey was started in 2010 and conducted every two years with a random sample of 25 provinces or regions (excluding Hainan, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan) across the country. Its broad disciplinary coverage and large sample size allow better tracking of data on different types of households. (2) This study's 2014 and 2018 datasets align with China's 2015 and 2018 poverty eradication and rural revitalization initiatives. Given that the CFPS dataset is collected from individuals and households through long-term tracking, a total of 18,702 rural samples that were present in both 2014 and 2018 were selected for this paper.  3.2.2 Selection of indicators and description In this paper, the annual water, electricity, fuel, and heating bills of farm households are selected from the CFPS dataset, and these four types of energy expenditure are used to measure the “Energy Demand” and “Energy Burden” dimensions of farm households; cooking fuel and cooking water were selected as indicators to measure the “Availability of Clean Energy” dimension; household appliances and farm machinery were used to measure the “Household Equipment” dimension; and finally, cultural and recreational expenditure was used to measure the “Culture & Entertainment” dimension. All the variables and descriptive statistics used in this paper are listed in Table 2  .   3.3 MEP in Chinese rural households This paper focuses on measuring MEP among rural Chinese households through eight 2-level indicators encompassing five dimensions: household clean energy availability, energy demand, energy affordability, household equipment, and culture & entertainment. 3.3.1 Measurement of basic energy demand Regarding the measurement of household energy demand, we used a methodology consistent with previous studies (Wang and Lin, 2022 ). As shown in Table 3  , where M1 and M2 represent regression analyses with annual electricity bill per capita and total annual energy consumption per capita as dependent variables, respectively, and based on Eq. (10)  in Section 2.1 . The last two columns of Table 3  represent the electricity and total energy costs per capita corresponding to the quartiles of income for each group, respectively. From the regression results in Table 3 , it can be seen that, using the income group in Group 4 as the dividing line, the income of farm households begins to have a significant positive effect on the household's per capita electricity and total energy consumption, i.e., for each unit increase in net household income, its corresponding per capita annual household electricity and total energy consumption will increase by 27.429 and 80 units, respectively. Based on this result, we calculated the values of electricity and total energy consumption per capita per year for households whose income was classified as group 4 as 206.667 and 510 units, respectively, and used these two values as criteria to evaluate whether the farming households met their household energy needs. To verify the reasonableness of this result, we used the mean value of the electricity price of RMB 0.52/kWh and the average number of people eating at home of 3.72 per household, as tallied in Table 2 , to calculate the average annual household electricity consumption, which resulted in an average monthly household electricity consumption of 123.21 kWh, which is lower than the total average monthly consumption value of 172.01 kWh for the data used in this paper.  3.3.2 Energy poverty dimension description This study measures the MEPI in rural China based on five energy poverty dimensions, and in Table 4   we show the corresponding secondary indicators and weights for each dimension. In addition, each dimension is specified as follows: 3.3.2.1 Clean energy accessibility Fuel and water are an important part of every household's energy consumption, and the energy used by households for cooking is divided into traditional (unclean energy) and modern (clean energy) sources. Access to clean, reliable, affordable, and sustainable modern energy plays an important role in achieving a good quality of life and contributing to sustainable economic development and social progress (Pelz et al., 2018 ). Promoting the use of modern, clean energy can improve individual health and well-being and reduce air pollution and environmental degradation, which is also in line with the 17 UN SDGs (Xue and Wu, 2022 ). A household is therefore considered energy poor when it relies primarily on unclean water resources or traditional solid fuels as the primary source of energy for cooking.  3.3.2.2 Energy demand According to the study of Sadath and Acharya (2017) , conventional solid energy sources are employed by households to continue meeting their energy needs when their energy use falls short of fundamental requirements, especially in rural regions. For this type of agricultural household, we also classify them as being energy poor.  3.3.2.3 Energy burden In addition to sustainability, modernity, and dependability, UN SDG 7 also includes energy affordability as one of its four requirements. An important condition for energy affordability is that energy consumption does not exceed household affordability, and numerous scholars have utilized the 10 % indicator to measure household energy affordability, i.e., a household is considered energy poor if its fuel consumption exceeds 10 % of its income (Heindl and Schüssler, 2015 ; Taylor, 1993 ). In line with previous approaches, this paper is based on this indicator to measure the affordability of energy in rural households.  3.3.2.4 Household equipment Chang et al. (2020) , based on a procedural and recognition justice perspective in energy justice, argue that even a household that has access to electricity is to some extent energy poor if it is not able to own modern household appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines, televisions, and air conditioners. In addition, as this paper explores households in rural areas, a sub-indicator of agricultural machinery is added to the paper.  3.3.2.5 Culture & entertainment All activities in human society, including food, clothing, shelter, and transportation, as well as culture and entertainment, are dependent on energy, as they all directly or indirectly consume energy (Anser, 2019 ). Culture and entertainment play a significant role in the spiritual requirements and quality of life of individuals. This paper employs cultural and entertainment deprivation as a significant complementary dimension to measure MEP in households, as cultural and entertainment deprivation and energy poverty are interrelated. Certain cultural and recreational activities, such as watching films and playing video games, require significant energy support, such as electricity and gas (Crentsil et al., 2019 ). Yet, energy-poor households frequently encounter both accessibility and affordability obstacles. In order to satisfy their fundamental needs, they must strictly regulate their energy consumption. To save money on energy costs, household members typically reduce or eliminate other expenditures, such as those on entertainment and culture (Nsenkyire et al., 2023 ). In addition, energy-poor households often lack access to cultural and recreational facilities (Zhang et al., 2021a, 2021b ). Especially if they live in remote, impoverished areas and lack access to cultural and recreational resources in the city, they may not be able to afford participation costs, such as the energy required for long-distance travel. In our index, a household is deemed energy impoverished if it spent no money on entertainment or culture in the year under review.     4 Results and discussion 4.1 MEP measurement results 4.1.1 MEP in rural China To provide a more comprehensive analysis of the MEP status of the sample households, we measured the change in MEP households (See Fig. 2 ) , MEP incidence, average deprivation share, and MEPI from a threshold of 0.1 to 1 (See Fig. 3 ) . The specific results are presented in Table 5  . As the k  value increases, the number of MEP households becomes progressively smaller, the MEP incidence and MEPI also become progressively smaller, while the average deprivation share gradually increases. By looking at the MEP at different values of k , when k  has a value of 0.7 or greater, the incidence of MEP is 3.8 % or less. Such a low incidence of energy poverty is clearly inconsistent with the current situation of energy poverty in China. He et al. (2018)  conducted an empirical study on the achievements of energy poverty alleviation in China and found that despite the fruitful results achieved through the long-term and unremitting efforts of many parties, the incidence of energy poverty still exists, and the depth and incidence of energy poverty in rural households are significantly higher than those in urban households. Furthermore, based on previous studies (Sokołowski et al., 2020 ), the number of MEP households is lower than the number of non-MEP households. According to a study on household energy consumption in China, it is stated that most rural households in China have escaped the problem of energy poverty (Dong et al., 2021 ; He et al., 2018 ), yet when k  = 0.5, the corresponding incidence of energy poverty is over 50 %, a result that is again inconsistent with the facts. Therefore, when k  takes a value of 0.6, the calculated results all satisfy the above conditions, so we chose k  = 0.6 as the threshold value for measuring MEP in this study. When k  = 0.6, there were 5895 households in the sample with MEP status, and the MEP incidence and MEPI were 31.5 % and 0.207, respectively.  4.1.2 Single energy poverty dimension contribution (k  = 0.6) After completing the MEPI measure, its index was decomposed using k = 0.6 to explore the contribution of a single energy poverty dimension to MEP. Overall, the culture and entertainment dimensions contribute the most to the MEP in rural areas of the country at 30.1 %; the clean energy poverty dimension and the energy demand dimension contribute equally at 22.6 % and 21.3 %, respectively; energy affordability contributes 15.2 %; and the household equipment dimension contributes the least at 11.2 %. Firstly, for the cultural and recreational dimension, the high contribution means that a relatively high incidence of poverty is accounted for in the rural areas of the country. The reasons for this result are not difficult to explain. Although times have changed and society has progressed, some rural areas are still very backward, and farmers have few cultural and recreational activities. The main reasons for the relative backwardness of cultural and recreational activities in rural areas compared to urban areas include the poor condition of cultural facilities at the grassroots level, the lack of talent in the cultural cadre, the single form of cultural and recreational activities, and the old-fashioned mindset of farmers. The affordability of energy for rural households makes a smaller contribution than the availability of clean energy and whether energy meets basic needs. This suggests that the country's fight against poverty has largely alleviated the problem of the affordability of energy services and secured the most basic energy service needs of the population. For example, in recent years, the government has implemented various economic subsidy policies for farming households, which have largely alleviated the economic pressure on the poor (Hou et al., 2022 ). However, this economic improvement is exogenous and limited, and it has not helped farmers improve their ability to access modern energy and achieve full and free individual sustainability (Iskandarova et al., 2021 ; Isoaho et al., 2017 ), so many farmers are still stuck in a situation where clean energy is not available and energy use does not meet basic needs. In addition, the household equipment dimension selected for this paper contains two sub-indicators: household electrical equipment and farm machinery. According to Table 6  , the contribution of domestic electrical equipment is the smallest of all level-2 indicators, accounting for only 1.1 %, whereas the contribution of agricultural machinery is 10.1 %. This may be because, in recent years, the government has expanded the electricity grid and provided electricity subsidies in rural areas, allowing rural households to access electricity services (Li and Solaymani, 2021 ). Moreover, as the technology for the production of household electrical equipment continues to advance, production costs have decreased, resulting in a decrease in the price of household electrical equipment. This has allowed more farmers to afford domestic appliances (Poblete-Cazenave and Pachauri, 2021 ). However, the purchase and maintenance costs of farm machinery and equipment are higher than those of household appliances. For energy-poor households, the high cost is out of their reach and may lead them to abandon farm equipment (Ma et al., 2018 ). In addition, the technical skills required to use farm machinery compared to traditional manual farming and the large amount of energy, such as electricity or oil, required to use it can also discourage farmers from trying farm machinery when farming (Gao et al., 2020 ).   4.2 Digital empowerment and MEP in rural areas In Section 4.1 , this paper constructs a regional MEPI for rural China and investigates the contribution of single-dimensional EP to MEP. To investigate further whether there is an interaction between SDGs 7 and 9, this paper uses MEP and single-dimensional energy poverty as the dependent variables (SDG 7) and digital empowerment (i.e., whether the farmer is online or not) as the core independent variable (SDG 9) for the baseline regression analysis. In addition, the regression model in this paper controls for respondents' personal characteristics (gender, age, and satisfaction with living in their own home) and household characteristic variables (type of dwelling, government subsidy, number of people eating, total net household income, net household income per capita, and net household assets). Table 7   presents the regression results for regression models using time fixed effects and province fixed effects, where M1 represents a binary discrete variable with the dependent variable MEP. Dimensions 1 to 5 reported in Table 7  represent the regression results with clean energy availability, energy demand, energy burden, household equipment, and cultural recreation as the dependent variables, respectively. 4.2.1 Empirical results From the results of the benchmark regressions presented in Table 7 , it is clear that digital empowerment can mitigate the MEP of rural households in China with a regression coefficient of 0.287, i.e., for each unit increase in digital empowerment, rural households' MEP decreases by 0.287 units. Comparing the impact of digital empowerment on a single dimension of EP, we find that digital empowerment minimizes cultural and recreational poverty among rural households (with an impact coefficient of 0.304); household clean energy availability and energy demand are affected by digital empowerment to a comparable extent, both with an impact coefficient of 0.203. In comparison, energy affordability is less affected by digital empowerment, at 0.176. However, it is worth noting that the impact of digital empowerment on the household equipment dimension was not significant. In addition, this study also tested the robustness and endogeneity of the model using adjustment of sample size, replacement of core independent variables, and instrumental variables. The results of the tests confirm that the benchmark regression model constructed in this paper is robust. Further information and details are provided in the Supplementary Material.  4.2.2 Analysis of results Overall, digital empowerment is conducive to alleviating the MEP of Chinese rural households, with the strongest alleviation of cultural and recreational poverty for farm households. Internet-based digital development has greatly expanded people's access to information and broken the spatial limitations of information transmission, especially for residents in rural areas, where the use of the Internet has greatly enhanced their social networks (He et al., 2022 ). Mihelj et al. (2019)  argue that digital development has provided new forms and access to cultural entertainment for a wide range of rural internet users, while also increasing the accessibility and adaptability of cultural entertainment in rural areas and reducing the energy costs associated with traditional forms of cultural entertainment. Specifically, digital empowerment can provide new forms and access to cultural entertainment for rural households through the internet and digital technology (Zhou and Zou, 2023 ). For example, people can access culture and entertainment anytime and anywhere by reading online, watching movies or videos, listening to music, etc. These digital products do not require a large energy supply and are inexpensive. This compares to traditional forms of cultural entertainment, such as cinemas and gaming halls, which usually require rural residents to spend a lot of time and money traveling to cities, and participation in these traditional forms of entertainment can be accompanied by significant energy consumption (Haight et al., 2014 ). Digital empowerment, on the other hand, allows farmers to enjoy entertainment from the comfort of their own homes, avoiding long journeys and high costs, reducing the cost of cultural entertainment, and making it available to a wider range of farmers (Zhou et al., 2023 ). It must be acknowledged that the choice of cultural and recreational activities at home via the Internet still requires a certain amount of energy (Ren et al., 2021 ), but the energy consumption and financial pressure caused by this form of entertainment are relatively low compared to that of out-of-home entertainment, and it is also more acceptable to farmers. Thus, in rural areas where recreational facilities are lacking, digital empowerment can provide a large number of cultural and recreational resources for rural residents, enriching the spiritual life of rural households (Alfredsson Ågren et al., 2020 ), while helping them to save the cost of traveling long distances for recreation and reducing energy consumption, thus alleviating the energy poverty of rural households in the cultural and recreational dimension. The Internet is a key factor in altering household energy consumption patterns in the age of digital transformation (Morley et al., 2018 ). In terms of clean energy accessibility and energy to meet basic needs dimensions in farm households, digital development facilitates access to clean energy-related information for farm households to promote clean energy acceptance and thus a clean energy transition in rural areas (Li et al., 2022 ). In addition, the use of clean energy can mitigate indoor air pollution and improve the well-being of farm households compared to traditional solid fuels (Xu and Ge, 2022 ). Given this advantage, farmers will use the Internet as a virtual spatio-temporal communication medium to encourage more of their friends and family to use clean cooking energy. He et al. (2020)  argued that digital empowerment can theoretically act as a mediating bridge between neighbor behavior and rural households' adoption of clean cooking fuels, and they showed through empirical studies that households using clean cooking energy can motivate other households in the same village to access or use the Internet, and in turn, more households use clean cooking energy. Similar studies have shown that with digitalization, the penetration of the Internet into farm households can largely change the habits and mindsets of household members, making them more concerned with their own well-being (Bardazzi and Pazienza, 2017 ). Since traditional non-clean energy sources can cause irreversible harm to human health and the environment, people are more inclined to use the Internet to search for more environmentally friendly energy sources to meet their own basic energy needs, which in turn leads to a clean energy transition in more rural households. The rapid development of the digital economy is mainly driven by information and data as the core driver, which has become a new engine to drive the development of various industries in the new era (Núñez-Merino et al., 2020 ). Energy affordability, as one of the important dimensions affecting the MEP of rural households, suffers from the impact of digital development that should not be underestimated. Goldfarb and Tucker (2019)  argued that the impact of digital development is indispensable in many future socioeconomic areas, such as the energy Internet, energy-efficient appliances, smart grids, and online environmental monitoring. The rapid development of Internet technology has largely improved the efficiency of collecting, processing, and analyzing energy information (Fang et al., 2021 ). Based on the technological advantages of the Internet, not only can energy efficiency and the large-scale utilization of clean energy be improved comprehensively (Han and Guo, 2022 ), but also the allocation of energy resources can be optimized in order to promote the optimization and upgrading of energy systems (Mahmud et al., 2020 ), which in turn makes modern energy affordable to more farmers. In addition, a study confirmed that households using the Internet are more inclined to use the convenience brought by the Internet to increase income sources for their own households compared to households not using the Internet, which can mitigate the risk of unaffordable household energy from the Internet increasing household income level (Hosan et al., 2022 ). The results of the single-dimensional regressions show that the effect of Internet use on household devices in farm households is not significant. The reasons for this result are not difficult to explain. On the one hand, although the development of the Internet economy has changed people's consumption patterns, household equipment such as household appliances and agricultural machinery, as durable goods in farmers' homes, are more likely to be experienced and purchased in person by traditional shopping methods (i.e., going to physical stores) (Zhang and Wang, 2019 ). In particular, since the population living in rural areas is mostly elderly, they are influenced by traditional consumption views and have not fully accepted online shopping. Given the virtual characteristics of the Internet, they are unable to experience the authenticity of the items in person, thus questioning the reliability and trustworthiness of online shopping services (Zou et al., 2018 ). On the other hand, since household appliances and agricultural machines are not disposable products, farmers prefer to go to physical stores close to their homes rather than purchasing online, considering the ease of future maintenance (Zhang, 2020 ).   4.3 The relationship between MEP and UN SDGs 4.3.1 MEP status in other developing countries Energy is the basis of human existence and plays an important role in ensuring the health and quality of life of the population and in promoting socio-economic development and social progress. However, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that 1.26 billion people remain in absolute energy poverty and up to 2.64 billion people remain in relative energy poverty, mainly in developing countries (IEA, 2020 ). According to Djeunankan et al. (2023) , only 68.1 % of the total population in developing countries had access to electricity in 2019, and there is an uneven distribution of electricity services, clean fuels, and cooking technologies. In addition, there is a large gap between urban and rural energy services in developing countries. In 2019, only 56.7 % of the rural population in developing countries had access to electricity, compared to 85.5 % of the urban population (World Bank, 2022 ). In a systematic review of research on energy poverty in developing countries, Sy and Mokaddem (2022)  found that the three dimensions of poor access to electricity, unaffordability of energy, and difficulty with clean cooking fuels are important energy problems currently faced by rural areas in all developing countries, and that these problems are most acute in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, compared to developed countries, rural areas in developing countries have relatively poor infrastructure, lacking access to electricity, communications, roads and other infrastructure, which in turn limits the availability and use of energy services such as cultural recreation and household appliances (Iddrisu and Bhattacharyya, 2015 ).  4.3.2 The relationship between MEP mitigation and the achievement of UN SDGs Energy poverty, as a major marker of national poverty, has become a hot issue of concern for all sectors of society on how to better address the issue of energy poverty (Iddrisu and Bhattacharyya, 2015 ). In the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) proposed by the United Nations in 2015, 17 overarching goals and 169 targets are clearly set out, such as eradicating all forms of poverty and ensuring access to affordable, reliable, clean, and sustainable energy for all (United Nations, 2015 ), of which the goals of eradicating all forms of poverty and ensuring energy affordability are highly The two goals of eradicating all poverty and ensuring energy affordability are highly relevant to the other SDGs. Specifically, ensuring access to clean energy reduces disease and environmental pollution caused by traditional solid fuel use, thereby promoting physical and mental health, and enhancing well-being (SDG 3). Similarly, alleviating poverty in drinking water resources can help to achieve SDG 6, which refers to ‘ensuring equitable access to safe and affordable clean drinking water for all’. Furthermore, given that the five dimensions used in this paper to measure MEP in rural areas of the country include not only direct energy poverty but also indirect energy poverty, and given that previous studies have found that rural areas in other developing countries face the same type of energy poverty (Djeunankan et al., 2023 ; Sy and Mokaddem, 2022 ), Similar to direct energy poverty, indirect energy poverty is also linked to some of the UN SDGs. The energy poverty in household equipment and the cultural and recreational dimensions selected for this paper have some links to the SDG of affordable and equitable access to infrastructure and new products for all. Therefore, alleviating energy poverty in household equipment and cultural recreation is necessary if such goals are to be achieved.   4.4 Designing a policy framework for achieving SDGs While digital innovation has permeated all facets of farm households and helped them structure their energy consumption, it must be accompanied by an up-to-date policy regime if it is to assist households in escaping energy poverty and enhancing energy efficiency. As discussed in Section 4.3 , rural areas in other developing nations face similar energy deprivation issues as rural areas in China. Based on the empirical findings of this paper and conceptual definitions from the fields of political science, administration, and public policy, we design a policy framework for China and other developing countries with similar energy poverty to ensure that digital development and energy efficiency are integrated and thus contribute to the achievement of certain sustainable development goals. The policy framework designed in this paper is shown in Fig. 4  . As previously mentioned, internet penetration in rural areas is minimal compared to urban areas, with nearly half of rural areas still lacking access. Based on this, policy makers need to follow the “1 + N” policy model (mainly involving the national policy level, the local governance level, and the target level). Policy makers need to implement national policy incentives, which include financial investment, tax support and integration mechanisms. The central government can empower and support local governments through these three mechanisms, which in turn will enable the effective implementation of local government promotion mechanisms.   5 Conclusions This study uses panel data for two periods in 2014 and 2018 to construct the MEPI in rural China using the A-F method and explores the impact of digital development represented by the Internet on the MEP of farm households. The main findings of this paper are as follows: (1) When the critical value k  = 0.6, the incidence of MEP and MEPI in rural areas of China is 31.5 % and 0.207, respectively; (2) the cultural and entertainment dimension has the highest contribution to MEP, followed by the availability of clean energy and the energy demand dimension; (3) digital empowerment can alleviate the MEP of farm households, among which the cultural and entertainment poverty of farm households has the highest alleviation effect, but the effect on household equipment poverty is not significant. And the results remain robust after overcoming the potential endogeneity problem using the instrumental variables approach. Therefore, we propose the following policy recommendations based on the empirical results and the policy framework constructed in this paper: Firstly, local governments can promote the active participation of business social organizations, research institutions or universities in the science and technology innovation mechanism through financial support and lower taxes to accelerate the innovation of new digital technologies or products (SDG12.a). Furthermore, the output of new technologies is not enough. Local governments need to implement financial investment mechanisms to strengthen infrastructure development, as well as to implement awareness-raising mechanisms to educate people about new digital technologies, especially for opinion leaders or activists in the community, so that they can take the lead in making more people knowledgeable about digital information technology, in order to increase the acceptance of new technologies or products by rural households, and thus increase the penetration of data information technology in rural The penetration rate of data IT in rural areas (SDG9.c). At the same time, the cost of access to the Internet can be significantly reduced through both financial and taxation mechanisms, thus ensuring equitable access to digital infrastructure for all (SDG9.1). Secondly, we need to make full use of the Internet's role as an information transfer and resource consolidation tool for household energy use, based on a consolidation mechanism and an advocacy and guidance mechanism, to deliver more knowledge and information on household energy use and try to widen the coverage of clean energy information. To make more farmers aware of the benefits of clean fuels and clean water for environmental sustainability and their health (SDG 12.8) and to call for more farmers to participate in activities to improve community water, fuel and sanitation management (SDG 6.b), thus ensuring that farmers have access to clean and reliable modern energy (SDG 7) while also ensuring a healthy (SDG 3). Finally, in order to prevent farmers from being negatively affected by online public opinion, policy makers also need to establish a monitoring and evaluation mechanism so that companies and governments can quickly identify online public opinion issues and contain them at an early stage (SDG12.b), and that the emergence of such issues is communicated to the national level for further improvement of the policy framework. Ultimately, this can facilitate the effective diffusion of networked communication technologies to rural areas on a large scale and alleviate household MEP, thereby achieving some of the SDGs. There are limitations to this study. Although the sample selected for our paper covers a large area, the 18,702 questionnaires do not accurately represent the rural population nationwide. In addition, given that this paper uses baseline regression analysis when exploring the impact of digital empowerment on farm household MEP, which is a method that mainly reflects the results of averaging the sample, future research can go deeper into rural areas to conduct targeted interview research and then use qualitative methods to study issues that cannot be identified by quantitative analysis.
