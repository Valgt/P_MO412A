                  The variety of local conditions across areas has created a plethora of problems and possibilities for the development of international sustainability frameworks including the SDGs. A popular revolutionary change was taken by local cities, communities, and enterprises that might offer a potential strategy for attaining sustainability, suited to each context's particular requirement. As a United Nations member, India has endorsed the Sustainable Development Goals, which serve as an outline for long-term development. The Indian government approved the “Agenda 2030,” which includes 17 SDGs goals with a set of indicators and targets. The indicators have been used to define the status of the present state with the fulfillment of the targets. Our main contribution to this study is that we have examined the current status of key targets for Indian Union Territories using SDG India Index 3.0 and the proposed technology as well as based on demonstration assessed the union territories with their achieving rank. We use Shannon Entropy and COCOSO technique in the MCDM model for evaluating the target. In our study, the final results show that Chandigarh has best implemented the Sustainable goal objectives for achieving the finest outcomes in comparison to other states, while Dadra Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu achieve the last rank. The key explanation for these types of results might be that the Union Territories at the bottom of the list have yet to adequately implement the SDGs. Finally, it is concluded that the outcomes are completely unbiased and acceptable and that the model utilized is suitable for carrying out this type of study.

The variety of local conditions across areas has created a plethora of problems and possibilities for the development of international sustainability frameworks including the SDGs. A popular revolutionary change was taken by local cities, communities, and enterprises that might offer a potential strategy for attaining sustainability, suited to each context's particular requirement. As a United Nations member, India has endorsed the Sustainable Development Goals, which serve as an outline for long-term development. The Indian government approved the “Agenda 2030,” which includes 17 SDGs goals with a set of indicators and targets. The indicators have been used to define the status of the present state with the fulfillment of the targets. Our main contribution to this study is that we have examined the current status of key targets for Indian Union Territories using SDG India Index 3.0 and the proposed technology as well as based on demonstration assessed the union territories with their achieving rank. We use Shannon Entropy and COCOSO technique in the MCDM model for evaluating the target. In our study, the final results show that Chandigarh has best implemented the Sustainable goal objectives for achieving the finest outcomes in comparison to other states, while Dadra Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu achieve the last rank. The key explanation for these types of results might be that the Union Territories at the bottom of the list have yet to adequately implement the SDGs. Finally, it is concluded that the outcomes are completely unbiased and acceptable and that the model utilized is suitable for carrying out this type of study.   Keywords Agenda 2030”  Indian union territories  Normalization  Sustainable development goals  Shannon entropy method  COCOSO method    1 Introduction Sustainable development is the concept of achieving social needs and desires of preserving the environmental system's ability to supply the basic resources in a sustainable manner on which the nation's economy relies. The targeted outcome is a state of society in which life circumstances and supplies are exploited to suit social desires without harming the environmental system's dependability and protection. Sustainable development can be described to achieve our individual needs. The major premise of the study is that if the evaluation process includes the use of MCDM methodologies, the evaluation of the development of the considered Indian Union Territory would be facilitated. As a result, the Union Territory's position toward reaching the specific goal and its position relative to the other Union Territories will be more simply and reliably assessed. As a consequence, an appropriate approach will be presented, as well as a specific conclusion concerning the current position in the field of sustainability. As a result, this work proposes using an MCDM method such as Shannon entropy [35 ,36 ] and Combined Compromise Solution (COCOSO) approach [46 ]. The overarching goal of this study is to provide a technique based on the MCDM that will aid in the estimate of the Union territories' progress toward the SDGs. The 15 indicators for the 15 SDGs for 2020 are provided to demonstrate and evaluate the applicability of the suggested hybrid approach. The evaluation was carried out using the specified indicators linked to each target for which data was available. Although the assessment and ranking are conducted for the year 2020, due to the length of the study, the computational approach is only illustrated for data from 2020. India, along with the rest of the globe, has entered the “Decade of Action.” With fewer than 10 years to meet the Global Goals, states are speeding the creation and implementation of long-term solutions to the world's most pressing issues, including poverty, climate change, and gender inequality. Since the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were implemented five years ago, all major development stakeholders have been able to establish an agreement on the importance and urgency of adopting, implementing, and monitoring the Global Goals in the national, sub-national, and local areas. To mention a few, prominent government programmers such as Ayushman Bharat, POSHAN Abhiyan, and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan coincide with SDG goals. The National Institution Transforming India (NITI) Aayog's SDG India Index & Dashboard have become the official and primary instrument for SDG monitoring in the national and sub-national stages. The Sustainable development goal India index, which employs an internationally recognized and proven methodology, assesses progress at the national and state/territory levels, providing policymakers with essential information on gaps, data, and statistical issues. The Index's value extends beyond progress tracking; it has established cooperative and competitive federalism by encouraging peer learning and healthy rivalry among the States/UTs. Since its inception in 2018, the index has fully documented and ranked Union Territories' progress toward meeting the SDGs. The index has become the key instrument for measuring performance on the SDGs in the country, while also encouraging competitiveness among the states and union territories. Under the federal framework, the Indian States/Union Territories are the key players in the sustainable development goals, agenda 2030 and they have continued to make progress on several SDG objectives. As the central organization for the SDGs, NITI Aayog has worked hard to give the required assistance and encouragement to foster cooperative impetus among organizations. Since 2018, the SDG India Index & Dashboard has served as a significant instrument for bringing the Targets explicitly & strongly through into the policy community in all states/union territories. The Index has been becoming the fundamental tool used to assess the performance of States and UTs and increasing intensity for substantial actions to SDG achievement, besides generating a remarkable spirit of competitiveness among national stakeholders. The power of collaboration among diverse stakeholders - government, academics, civilized society, enterprises, development agencies, international agencies, and so on is frequently not evident behind the efforts to meet the SDG objectives. The extent, scale, and complexity of the mutually reinforcing dimensions of economic, social, and environmental transformation that the SDGs need come together and complement each other's efforts. Such synergies can give rise to new methods of working, gather new knowledge, broaden access to opportunities, and promote responsibility and accountability exchange in multi-sectoral interactions serving a diversified population. Over the past five years, the SDG process of implementation has resulted in a variety of various kinds of relationships that must be emphasized and developed. In this context, the key subject of the Sustainable development goal India Index Report & Dashboard 2020–21 is collaboration as a notion and activity that announces the Decade of Action. Economic expansion and industrialization have resulted in several advantages such as higher living standards, affluence, and urbanization. However, this progress has resulted in a slew of detrimental global repercussions and challenges that may jeopardize future generations' well-being. Increased manufacturing output in the 1960s–1970s resulted in increased consumption, which resulted in a substantial burden on environmental protection, ultimately weakening the nature balance [4 ]. As practitioners and researchers across the world became conscious of the gravity of the situation, they began to highlight the necessity of ecological and preservation of the environment, and the word “sustainability” was coined. Initially, this phrase signified a link between the environment and development, but it has now broadened to embrace all elements of progress, environmental, social, and economic [29 ]. The SDGs that are being pursued today are dissimilar from those that have been attempted in the 1990s. Gaining new technology, particularly information and communications technology, has accelerated the globalization process, resulting in current environmental, economic, and common issues [8 ]. In 2000 the United Nations (UNs) adopted the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which highlight the principal goals for SD. The Millennium Development Goals include eight goals that should have been met by 2015, including concerns about eradicating extreme poverty, a global partnership for development, reducing child mortality, improving maternal health, primary education, gender equality, combating diseases, and environmental sustainability. Throughout that period, some countries completed substantial growth in the MDGs, whereas others didn't. Specifically, the circumstances differed depending on the country, the purpose, and the areas. For nearly fifteen years, therefore, the mentioned goals have been at the forefront of policy makers' thoughts all over the world. This culminated in the proposal of a comprehensive set of objectives known as the SDGs, which would be the focus of attention for the next 15 decades [31 ]. Specifically, the Member States of the UNs in 2015, approved the “Agenda 2030,” the main cornerstone of which is the 17 SDGs aimed at improving the global condition and therefore necessitating collaborative action. As previously stated, the SDGs comprise 17 objectives, of which goals 1–6 correspond to the previously presented MDGs, whereas targets 7–17 indicate a new approach that mainly focuses on new sustainability challenges. Every objective contains approximately 5 and 12 ambitions, and about 303 indicators are provided to proactively manage performance and progress related to the defined objectives and outcomes [10 ]. The development of the aims and indications drew a huge amount of attention and sparked arguments that culminated in their evaluation, intending to determine if there is appropriate empirical proof for each [11 ,28 ]. The ultimate findings suggest that around 17% of the planned objectives need to be revised [10 ] and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network has recommended 100 general observation criteria as reliable. In addition, some authors argue that this is a crossroads between goals and, if ignored, can lead to inconsistent consequences [39 ]. Five decades have gone by since the SDGs were adopted and the “Agenda 2030″ was published. There's an indication of evaluation of progress toward certain SDGs. Under-5 child mortality in global, national, and regional contexts is one of the themes expanded on and alluded to in the SDGs [17 ]. In addition, the scientist tracked maternal mortality from 1990 to 2015, with forecasts based on SDG attainment [3 ]. As well, the resources required to finance the upgrading of health systems in middle and low-income nations to achieve the Sustainable development targets are estimated [41 ]. Many writers also elaborate on the issues of health-related accomplishments of the papers [5 ,9 ,15 ,19 ], Roy et al. [30 ] investigated the end of poverty (SDG1), health (SDG3), and interdependence of water and sanitation (SDG6) in India. Surana et al. [42 ] examined the societal concerns that are especially effective and are linked to the SDGs. Furthermore, it has been explored how diverse strategy frameworks donate to or impede the accomplishment of the SDGs [23 ]. Pedercini et al. [25 ] discussed the relevance of using simulation integrated models to help in SDG strategy formulation. Mohammed et al. [22 ] investigated if there is a link between smart growth and meeting sustainability objectives, whilst Salvia et al. [32 ] examined mentioned attainment from both a global and local viewpoint. Aside from the topics mentioned, the authors have explored the evaluation of environmental degradation [6 ,34 ,37 ], and life below water [38 ] to SDG attainment. The study articles offered reveal that the writers focused on the attainment of a certain SD aim rather than all of them. Given that there are 17 SDGs, the difficulty of assessing progress toward their attainment might be referred to as the MCDM dilemma. The MCDM is a topic of management science and operational research that includes several strategies aimed at facilitating decision-making [12 ,40 ]. These approaches are frequently utilized in many commercial domains for prioritizing supplied choices, and they contribute to the increased dependability of the executed decision procedure [13 ,26 ,27 ]. Mishra and Rani [21 ], Deveci et al. [7 ], and Ali and Vladimir [2 ] these authors' publications provide a full description of the suggested methods. Throughout this period, the authors have created many adaptations to the suggested approaches that are based on neuromorphic numbers or fuzzy, intervals. The following publications [1 ,14 ] provide the most recent developments in the mentioned extensions and associated applications. As previously stated, MCDM approaches and models are used to solve an extensive choice of real-world and corporate challenges, including, but not limited to people assessment [33 ], supply chain management [45 ], tourism [16 ], information technology [43 ], and so many additional. Using a consensus-based expert qualitative data collection approach, Vinuesa et al. [47 ] discover that artificial intelligence can facilitate the achievement of 134 objectives across all targets, but it can also prevent the achievement of 59 goals. Vinuesa and Sirmacek [48 ] discuss the thoughts into easily understandable artificial-intelligence (AI) systems and how they are critical in the perspective of establishing ethical AI systems as well as data-driven solutions that are consistent with the sustainable development goals. Gupta et al. [49 ] offered a high-level overview of identifying and prioritizing research needs in AI progress for long-term transformation. They argue that an in-depth examination of the role of AI in providing support and overcoming specific restrictions impeding the Evaluation of indicators in SDG development is critical. The study of Suhil et al. [50 ] researched to investigate and compare multi-criteria methods was applying to spectrum choices. The following is a diagram of the paper's structure: Section 2  explains the suggested materials technique. Section 3  contains the result of the study. Discussion of the findings provides in Section 4 . Lastly, the conclusion of the study provides in Section 5 .  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Data Considering the attainment of the SDGs, it is critical to have credible and appropriate statistics to define where every other nation stands to the ideal. As a result, monitoring performance and achieving goals may be made easier. Evaluating the effectiveness of attaining the objectives, on the other hand, necessitates paying a lot of attention to the nuances in the database. The dataset may have several methodological flaws. As a result, the number of indicators may fluctuate over the monitored period of 2015–2030, casting a different light on the achievement of the specific goal. This approach may also evolve and vary between Union Territories, just as the quality of data collection. Although the similarities in time and spatial concerns, we accept the UN's aims and do not dispute their contents, nor do we incorporate alternative indicators or data sources, nor do we cluster them. To reach equivalent findings, only a few indicators needed to be weighted. Generally, we depend solely on official statistics released by the NITI Aayog, while we are aware of data gaps. To get consistent outcomes, we employ the same number of measurements over the whole-time frame evaluated in our research. The development of the SDGs agenda is being tracked via a detailed database released by the NITI Aayog, which was just presented. 17 interconnected sustainable development objectives were defined and described by targets, which are each reflected by indicators. Compliance with the goals is measured using overall indicators. Some of them are used frequently to depict the progression toward more than one goal. Because the SDGs were accepted by 193 countries: all United Nations members, representing nearly the whole inhabited world, they comprise one of the most diverse ranges one can envision. Because of this variety, the original social, economic, and environmental factors are critical drivers of attaining the objectives. Certain countries are beginning a long and tough path of change, but others have a more favorable starting point. The disparities in starting places as well as the processes to achieve the goal state necessitate a frequent and detailed appraisal of performance. Considering the amount of input data, it is important to choose the best manner to portray it to evaluate each country's status in reaching the Sustainable development goals and how far it has progressed since the SDGs were approved. As a result, not only signing on to the SDGs agreement is required, but also tracking and management, quality, performance data, and understanding to establish if the actions adopted directly correlate to the targets. The National Institution for Transforming India Aayog constructed the Sustainable development goal India Index 3.0, which includes 15 of the 17 SDGs (omitting Goals 14 and 17) for 2020. Cause SDG 14 and 17 data were missing and had to be discarded. For example, there is inadequate information on indicators for SDG 14 (Life below Water), and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) for some landlocked states. This meant that SDGs 14 and 17 had to be removed from our research. The Index measures the success of all Union Territories (UTs) on a set of 62 National Indicators, assessing their improvement on the results of the Government of India's actions and programs. The progress of the states in achieving the SDGs is highly dependent on the environment and local government. The 15 indicators related to the 15 goals were chosen for this article and included in the assessment method. Table 1   shows the Goal of the indicators, the indicators related to them, and the description. The key rationale for selecting the offered indicators is that they realistically depict the essence of the evaluated goals on their own. By incorporating all of the recommended indicators, two issues will arise: first, the model will become too large and hard to maintain, and second, several indicators would recur in numerous goals, potentially leading to insufficient outcomes.  2.2 Methods 2.2.1 Entropy technique The entropy Procedure is a well-known tool for providing objective criterion weights [18 ]. According to Wang and Lee [44 ], the following is the approach for determining criterion weights using the entropy method: The first step is to develop a decision matrix (DM) comprised of criteria and decision options. This decision matrix is depicted below:(1) D M = [ x i j   ]  m × n   = [ x 11   x 12      ⋯  x 1 n     x 21   x 22      ⋯  x 2 n     ⋮     ⋮         x m 1    x m 2          ⋱   ⋯     ⋮   x m n         ]       In this equation, x i j      denotes the performance of alternative i    in j    criteria. In this decision matrix, there are n    criteria and m    alternatives. Normalizing the Decision Matrix: The values in the decision matrix are normalized by (2) . The f i j      value in (2)  shows the normalized value.(2) f i j   = x i j   ∑  i = 1  m  x i j          Entropy Value Calculation: Following the normalization step, the entropy value of each criterion is determined using the following equation.(3) E j  = − ∑  i = 1  m  f i j    log  f i j    log  m        In the above equation E j     represent the entropy value, and log  m    represent the entropy coefficient. Calculation of Entropy Weight: Finally, the objective weight (w j    ) of each criterion is calculated with the subsequent equation. Lastly, evaluate the weighted value (w j    ) of each criterion by the subsequent equation.(4) w j  = 1 − E j   ∑  i = 1  n  ( 1 − E j  )         The w j     the value shown in (4)  shows the weight of the criterion. As a result of the entropy method, criterion weights are obtained. The weights obtained from the method are used for scoring within the criteria in different methods such as COCOSO.  2.2.2 The COCOSO technique COCOSO technique was proposed by Yazdani et al. [46 ]. This technique is founded on the combination of the weighted sum approach and the exponentially weighted product approach, as shown below:(5) S i  = ∑  j = 1  n  ( f i j   w j  )      (6) P i  = ∑  j = 1  n  ( f i j   )  w j       where S i     and P i     signify the sum of alternative i   's weighted comparison sequence and power-weighted comparability sequence respectively, w j     denotes criterion j   's weight, and f i j      denotes the normalized score of alternatives i    according to criteria j   , which is determined as described in the following:(7) f i j   = { x i j   − min i  x i j    max i  x i j   − min  i  x i j     ;       when criterion  j  is the benefit              max i  x i j   − x i j    max i  x i j   − min  i  x i j     ;             when criterion  j  is the non − benefit             where x i j      is signifies of alternatives i    based on criteria j   . The COCOSO technique ranks using the relative performance score l i    , which is computed from three aggregated appraisal ratings l i p     , l i q     , and l i r     , as described in the following:(8) l i  = 1 3  ( l i p   + l i q   + l i r    )  + ( l i p   . l i q   . l i r   )  1 3        With:(9) l i p   = S i  + P i   ∑  i = 1  m  ( S i  + P i  )        (10) l i q   = S i  min i  S i    + P i  min i  P i        (11) l i r   = λ S i  + ( 1 − λ )  P i   λ max  i  S i  + ( 1 − λ )  max i  P i        where λ    is the parameter, such as λ ∈ [ 0,1 ]     and it is commonly fixed to λ =    0.5.    3 The results The following processes can be used to evaluate progress toward reaching the goals that have been set by the adoption of the “Agenda 2030″ by utilizing the COCOSO and Shannon's Entropy techniques, as illustrated in following Fig. 1  . In this scenario, all eight Indian Union Territories (IUTs) have been examined using 15 indicators from the “Agenda 2030.” Due to the length of the study, the computation approach is only described for 2020. Table 1  shows the indicators utilized for evaluation, and the data for the Indian Union Territories' relevant indicators show in following Table 2  . Table 3   depicts a normalized decision matrix generated by Equation (7) . Table 3  also shows the significance of indicators generated using Equations (2)–(4) , the improvement optimization represented indicators as for maximum ‘Max’. And the weight of each objective is shown in Fig. 2  . Using Equations (5) and (6)  and statistics from Table 3 , the total weight and power-weight comparison systems are determined, as shown in Table 4   which also includes the values of three aggregated evaluation scores, l i p     , l i q     , and l i r      calculated using Equations 9–11 . Fig. 3   depicts progress evaluations based on the three scores l i p     , l i q     , and l i r     , whereas Fig. 4   depicts the influence of parameter λ    on the l i r     . By using Equation (8)  the relative performance score l i     evaluated, which has been used to assess progress toward reaching the “Agenda 2030″ sustainable development goals for 2020 of Indian Union Territories, Table 5   and Fig. 5   illustrate the results.  4 Discussion The efforts to track the SDGs through the SDG India Index & Dashboard have been extensively recognized and commended throughout the world. The use of a composite index focused on the SDGs to evaluate the states and union territories is currently an uncommon statistics attempt. NITI Aayog has a dual mandate: to supervise the country's acceptance and supervision of the SDGs, as well as to encourage states and UTs to be competitive and cooperative in their federalism. The index articulates the broad character of the 2030 Agenda's Global Goals while keeping attentive to national concerns. The index's modular form has made it a policy instrument as well as a quick reckoner for analyzing governments' and UTs' progress on a wide range of Goals, including health, climate change, education, gender, environment, institutions, and economic growth. The SDG India Index 2020–21, established in collaboration with the NITI Aayog, measures the performance among all states/union territories using 115 parameters linked to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation National Indicator Framework. The need to regularly evaluate performance and monitor progress, as well as account for the availability of the most recent SDG-related data on States and UTs, has driven the initiative to enhance and improve this crucial tool with each edition. Multiple talks with Union Ministries were held during the selection process for these 115 indicators. The reaction was solicited from all states/Union territories, and as the primary audience and stakeholder for this localization resource, they played an important part in the index's development by supplementing the performance appraisal with localized thoughts and information from reality. The Sustainable goal of the India Index 2020–21 is further strong than the preceding versions because of broader target and indicator coverage and a stronger connection with the NIF. 115 indicators cover 70 SDG goals and encompass 16 of the 17 SDGs. This is an advance over the index's previous editions, which used 62 indicators over 39 objectives and 13 Goals in 2018–19 and 100 indicators across 54 targets and 16 Goals in 2019–20. The Sustainable development goal India Index calculates goal-by-goal ratings for every state and union territory on the 16 SDGs. The overall scores for states and UTs are computed using target-wise scores to measure the sub-national unit's performance and effectiveness throughout the 16 SDGs. These ratings range from 0 to 100, and a score of 100 indicates that Union Territory has met the 2030 goals. The larger proximity to the objective attained, the higher score of UTs. The inaugural version of the SDG India Index was published in December 2018, with 62 parameters drawn among 39 objectives across 13 SDGs; Targets 14 and 17 were excluded leading to a shortage of attributes where this State-specific evidence was presented. The second edition of the Index, which covered all 17 Goals and 54 targets and was released in December 2019, had a wider scope with 100 indicators: 68 that were associated with the National Indicator Framework (NIF), 20 that were refined, and 12 that came from other authoritative governmental organizations. The third and present version (Index 3.0) is an increase over the 2019–20 version in terms of the target fulfillment. The indicator provides insights into the nation's and states'/UTs' social, economic, and ecological standing as they work to achieve the SDGs. The Index has been developed to be accessible to all stakeholders, including policymakers, civil society, enterprises, and the general public. Index 3.0 is built on a foundation of 17 SDGs and 169 objectives. The calculation of the Index is constructed on statistics and indicators for the primary 13 objectives, whereas fairness, Life on Lands and Peace, and institutional frameworks have indeed been established for Objectives 15 and 16, accordingly. It is built with 115 indicators that cover 70 objectives from 15 Goals. While the majority of the indicators are obtained straight from the NIF, some NIF indicators have been adjusted due to data availability across all UTs. On the use of the variables and availability of data, the individual ministries/departments and states/UTs have been thoroughly contacted. Finally, it is possible to conclude that the approach used is appropriate and that the acquired findings are actual and justified, confirming the premise expressed at the beginning of the study. The Shannon Entropy and COCOSO techniques were combined for this article. The Shannon Entropy was used to calculate the criterion weights or the relevance of the investigated indicators. The major justification for using the Shannon Entropy is its objectivity, which allows for the reduction of subjectivity to the lowest degree. The COCOSO approach, which is adaptable and simple to apply, is used to accomplish the final ranking of the UTs. The results achieved in this manner indicate a compromise approach that takes into account variances in the assessment criteria. As a result, the improved position of UTs that have good successes just related to particular targets, while the rest are silently awful, is avoided. This compromise option provides context for the rated nations' balanced achievements. Furthermore, the suggested method's usefulness and reliability were validated by comparison with existing proven MCDM approaches. Even though some researchers, for instance, Miola and Schiltz [20 ], mentioned that the nation's situation is heavily dependent on the indicators and methodology used, it couldn't be disowned that incorporating the Sustainable development goal signifiers into the reliable resolution framework will indeed make a significant contribution to having a coherent picture of the nation's schemes proposed and performance was compared to the another. The acquired findings will be more robust and dependable if all specified indicators are taken into account. Furthermore, estimating the development of nations by each aim independently and by a set of indicators linked to it would allow for a more accurate understanding of the existing position in the notion of sustainable development, as well as a good forecast of emerging developments. Since the presented technique demonstrated beneficial in assessing sustainability successes.  5 Conclusions The findings show that Chandigarh as an Indian Union Territories making the most significant progress in meeting the “Agenda 2030″ standards. Based on the data taken from Indian NITI Aayog, the attained performance is better in all areas. Despite this, Chandigarh is making steady and equitable progress toward all of its objectives. In certain categories, including gross domestic spending on R&D by sector, Chandigarh outperforms all other IUTs. Chandigarh's performances and declared results with the “Agenda 2030″ have never really been some of the worst, rather always been in the middle of the scale, placing Chandigarh as a UTs that makes the most substantial progress toward establishing SDGs. The primary goal of this study was to provide a multiple Criteria framework based on the Shannon Entropy technique and COCOSO technique as a tool to help in the evaluation of performance towards reaching the SDGs. For determining weights weight of the criterion, utilized the Shannon Entropy approach and the COCOSO methodology was utilized for the final ranking of the evaluated UTs. The technique presented is based on 15 metrics and it is related to the 15 SDGs. Although a bigger number of indicators are presented, only 15 are used in the decision-making procedure, which best represent the discussed aims. In this manner, the scenario of the complicated and extended model, as well as the indication repetition, is prevented. According to the final statistics, Chandigarh is the UTs with the optimum performance in terms of sustainable development. Dadra Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu have produced the poorest scores. To improvements in expectancy goals, these two UTs must put in significant effort in several crucial fields. A comparison of the acquired data with those of the other writers confirms the conclusions reached. The last aspects are that the MCDM approaches in this case, COCOSO and Shannon Entropy technique, are effective for assessing the development of UTs achieving SDGs and that the findings achieved are unbiased and relevant. The plan for future works includes performing the evaluation procedure using MCDM methodologies, considering objectives and indicators, and intended objectives. Incorporating the intended objectives into the evaluation framework will assure the acquisition of objective evidence that will accurately reflect the existing position and progress toward desired goals, as well as highlight any potential deficiencies that should be addressed. Furthermore, the suggested model might be enhanced using fuzzy, gray, or intuitionistic fuzzy extensions, and the unbiased method could be utilized to determine the weights. Despite this, our model which is based on the COCOSO and Shannon Entropy techniques demonstrated their pertinency and proved to be highly useful for measuring the development of UTs toward meeting “Agenda 2030″ goals. For assessing UTs performance in implementing and adopting the SDG agenda 2030, the Index 3.0 is a valuable tool. The following limitations of nonetheless, the Index and its analysis.1. Due to a lack of adequate data at the UTs level, the Index doesn't assess indicators of SDG 14 and 17.  2. The whole set of the National Indicator Framework could not be added owing to a lack of information at the UTs level, as well as for reasons of finer focus.  3. To maintain data accuracy and consistency between them, indicators and data from UT statistics databases and non-government sources were not included.  4. The SDG India Index 3.0 indicators have been aligned with the National Indicator Framework to the greatest degree feasible, the Index 1.0 and 2.0 indicators change marginally from the SDG India. As a result, these indexes aren't exactly equivalent.
