                  The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11), which focuses on making cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and ecologically viable, is an essential framework for assessing the sustainability of urban areas. Achieving this goal requires complex multi-pronged solutions. Blockchain technology (BCT) is emerging as a potentially powerful tool for addressing the multifaceted challenges of urban sustainability and resilience. In this paper, we provide a critical review and evaluation of BCT as a core contributor to the targets set by SDG 11. Each of the 10 specific targets is critically evaluated herein with regards to how BCT can help achieve or potentially hinder success. BCT can serve to enhance the inclusiveness, safety, and environmental quality of cities. However, its implementation should be approached with caution. BCT could also contribute to a digital divide, raise privacy concerns, be unfairly leveraged by more developed regions, and even exacerbate existing environmental issues. While BCT has shown promise in managing urban crises, it is crucial to exercise restraint to prevent inadvertently aggravating certain challenges. Therefore, informed policymakers must carefully capitalize on the potential of BCT in their efforts to align with SDG 11. Lastly, an overview of the key areas for future research is presented.

Table 2:    Target Description of Challenges Reference(s)   11.1.1  Lack of comprehensive land registry and political and cultural resistance. Need for strong public partnerships, political buy-in, and institutional cooperation. (Ansah et al., 2023 )  Potential threats to the system, including the risk of sabotage by corrupt land officials and customs authorities. Private companies that use BCT for land dealings may try to undermine the system out of fear of losing their place in the market; removed middlemen may also attempt to interfere with the system. (Ameyaw & de Vries, 2021 )  11.1.2  High cost of BCT implementation associated with transactions, building the platform, deploying the system, cloud services, ongoing maintenance, and monitoring. Meeting multiple key criteria for choosing the right blockchain platform, such as the total cost of transactions over the project's lifetime, transaction duration and size, simplicity of adaptation, integration with available tools and infrastructure, and data privacy. (Yang et al., 2020 )  Barriers to the integration of blockchain in small construction projects include operational challenges (e.g., compatibility with current systems), privacy and regulatory barriers (e.g., ambiguous regulations), work environment obstacles (e.g., resistance to change, cultural differences), economic and planning barriers (e.g., lack of confidence among key stakeholders, high implementation costs), and technological limitations (e.g., scarcity of qualified personnel, integration with conventional building techniques). (Waqar et al., 2024 )  11.2.1  Permission from the current legal system governing the grid for prosumers to engage in energy trading with consumers and the integration of BCT and smart contracts into the energy grid. (Diestelmeier, 2019 )  Delays in consensus, more traffic, and the high sensitivity of vehicular ad-hoc network applications to delays, particularly in relation to roadway emergencies and safety issues. Developing reliable and lightweight consensus algorithms. (Grover, 2022 )  Public refusal to use BCT due to a lack of awareness and the need for management campaigns and educational activities to enhance adoption and public trust. (Singh et al., 2022a )  11.2.2  Managing a large amount of data and transactions in the constantly changing environment of moving vehicles. Performance metrics such as latency, throughput, and scalability. (Kapassa et al., 2021 )  11.3  Possibility of delayed transactions for public participation and in situations with a high workload on the main node during the simultaneous execution of transactions, such as on election days. (Khan et al., 2020 )  Risk related to citizen participation due to the lack of digital literacy and technical knowledge among participants, and system scalability. (Taş & Tanrıöver, 2020 )  11.4  Highly complex fundamental terms, representational design, and connotations for cultural heritage. The expressions, knowledge, practice, and skills associated with a particular item of cultural heritage may be ambiguous, isolated, insufficient, and at times contentious. (Erol et al., 2022 )  Organizations and countries are unprepared to cope with the privacy and security concerns raised by the metaverse. (Zhang et al., 2022 )  Interoperability issues for using BCT to promote practices related to cultural heritage, such as in the transportation of relics. (Dwivedi et al., 2022 )  11.5.1  The constraining factor of the network slows down the propagation speed of the network, leading to a delay in block verification. (Dwivedi et al., 2021 )  11.5.2  Since each UAV in a blockchain-based UAV system has a copy of the distributed ledger, some personal or sensitive information is distributed to all participating UAVs. The scalability of BCT in the case of large UAV swarms. UAVs might create gigabytes of data, and blockchain storage capacity may be insufficient. (Mehta et al., 2020 )  11.5.3  A lack of resources or infrastructure prevents developing nations from accessing individual identification information like dental records, which hinders forensic investigations as the technology relies on the availability and quality of the victim's records. (Jebraeily et al., 2020 )  11.6.1  Determining where to place tags in case of materials breakdown, particularly for plastics and microbeads, and identifying suitable options for removing tags. Regulatory uncertainties regarding the responsibility for equipment and resources, along with challenges regarding combating fake data entering the blockchain, a condition difficult to modify due to the immutability feature of the technology. (Steenmans et al., 2021 )  Developing a blockchain-based waste management system requires a special design for each type of waste, as well as estimation of costs, which may prove to be a barrier to adoption. BCT is perceived negatively by some because of the bad reputation of cryptocurrencies. (Baralla et al., 2023 )  11.6.2  Challenges for management and synchronization of diverse IoT networks due to their various platforms, including 2G, 3G, 4G, WiFi, Bluetooth, and LAN. High energy consumption and cost of using BCT in a network with high data exchange, even with enhanced performance. (Sharma & Park, 2018 )  11.7.1  The limited storage capacity of most nodes in a space network presents a challenge due to the large size of spatial data and need for a new approach to storing the data. Due to their small size and light weight, most satellites can only allocate a limited amount of power to the communication subsystem, and integrating BCT into satellite networks can lead to increased data exchange between nodes and thus higher power consumption. (Mohanta et al., 2019 )  11.7.2  By utilizing smart contracts on a blockchain, a scenario can be extended to offer more advanced and secure evidence of witness presence beyond GPS, through the composition of intricate social proofs. (Pournaras, 2020 )  Although blockchain might help migrant workers reduce their vulnerability and risk, as with many illegal activities, workers who willingly engage in illegal work arrangements are unlikely to use tools to protect themselves; their activities would essentially stay off-chain. As a result, even if BCT applications were developed, employers who wanted to entrap vulnerable workers would not voluntarily adopt the technology. (Christ & V Helliar, 2021 )  11.a.1  The limited number of studies suggesting BCT-based approaches to address DoS and malware attacks and eavesdropping in mobile crowdsourcing platforms have been unable to address the vulnerabilities of the proposed systems. (Chen et al., 2021 )  11.a.2  The need for governance and regulation, as well as the potential for unequal access to the technology in various regions. (Scott et al., 2017 )  11.a.3  Investigating the effects of BCT-based investment on micro- and macroeconomic factors. (Schuetz & Venkatesh, 2020 )  11.b  The need for an updated legal framework to accommodate BCT's disruptive nature. Regulatory issues preventing firms from investing in BCT. The introduction of new concepts like smart contracts and cryptographic signatures can conflict with existing laws, meaning that blockchain ledgers may be subject to conflicting tax regulations and legal definitions across international jurisdictions or multiple states. (Sahebi et al., 2020 )  Regulations are necessary to prevent a conflict of interest among the wide range of infrastructure users, from the government to citizens. For example, there are many discussions about the conflict between the use of BCT and General Data Protection Regulation, such as: (i) the conflict between the right to be forgotten and the immutability of records, (ii) balance between data protection by design and transparency and tamper-proofness of blockchain, and (iii) contrast between a centralized data controller and decentralized nodes in BCT. (Tatar et al., 2020 )  11.c  Differences in legal systems among countries cause challenges to asset tokenization that must be addressed. Tokenization in different countries would have different legal standings, and this may discourage international investors. Conflicting regulatory regimes that inhibit the open and international exchange of security tokens might undermine the benefits of tokenization. (Garcia-Teruel & Simón-Moreno, 2021 )  A reliable central authority is needed to ensure the connection between token and asset, monitor infrastructure assets, and update the status as conditions change. Selecting a reliable and trustworthy central authority that can facilitate connections and promote confidence among all parties remains uncertain. Without an established connection, it is uncertain if tokens are backed by infrastructure assets; this might damage the legitimacy of tokenized markets and private sector participation (Tian et al., 2020 )     Table 3 General challenges to BCT implementation.  Table 3:    Field Description of Challenges Reference(s)   Political Indeterminate laws and a need to recognize the demand for regulatory changes and contractual models for adopting digitization by policymakers and lawyers. (Oesterreich & Teuteberg, 2016 ; Panarello et al., 2018 ; Li et al., 2019 ; Alaloul et al., 2020 )  Economic High implementation cost, lack of transparency in companies, especially financial issues, inefficient supply chain, lack of investment in innovation and R&D, volatility of cryptocurrency rates and low predictability, quality issues, delays, and inefficient collaboration, communication, and management techniques.

Achieving this goal requires complex multi-pronged solutions. Blockchain technology (BCT) is emerging as a potentially powerful tool for addressing the multifaceted challenges of urban sustainability and resilience. In this paper, we provide a critical review and evaluation of BCT as a core contributor to the targets set by SDG 11. Each of the 10 specific targets is critically evaluated herein with regards to how BCT can help achieve or potentially hinder success. BCT can serve to enhance the inclusiveness, safety, and environmental quality of cities. However, its implementation should be approached with caution. BCT could also contribute to a digital divide, raise privacy concerns, be unfairly leveraged by more developed regions, and even exacerbate existing environmental issues. While BCT has shown promise in managing urban crises, it is crucial to exercise restraint to prevent inadvertently aggravating certain challenges. Therefore, informed policymakers must carefully capitalize on the potential of BCT in their efforts to align with SDG 11. Lastly, an overview of the key areas for future research is presented.

Making environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable metropolises is essential to addressing a wide range of global and local problems. For a city to be considered sustainable, certain crucial elements must be satisfied. As formulated by the United Nations, sustainable development goals (SDGs) include 17 interconnected targets, each with a set of objectives that provide clarity regarding the most important factors in achieving a sustainable world. “Sustainable Cities and Communities” targets are formulated under the 11th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 11). This goal is designed to facilitate cities that are inclusive, green, safe, and sustainably managed, with a focus on improving the quality of life for all residents (Akuraju et al., 2020 ; D'Adamo et al., 2022 ). This goal and its targets are only attainable when comprehensive actions are taken to address current and future challenges and transformative changes made through sustainable methods. To this end, different types of novel technologies have been introduced. Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and Blockchain Technology (BCT) are among the various disruptive efforts that have gained significant traction in both the scientific community and industry. The literature has widely examined the impact of AI and IoT on SDGs, specifically in the context of cities and urban areas (e.g., Haseeb et al., 2021 ; Jain et al., 2023 ; Leal Filho et al., 2024 ; Singh et al., 2024 ; Vinuesa et al,. 2020 ; Zeng et al., 2024 ). Many such studies have highlighted the significant contributions of AI and IoT to enhancing urban sustainability. By empowering organizations to optimize operations, improve efficiency, drive innovation, and expedite the implementation of SDGs, AI and IoT have played a crucial role in advancing this goal. Yet, these technologies have failed to address some of the main challenges that cities face, such as the presence of intermediaries who do not add value, unequal rights for citizens, the need for a central control authority, lack of peer-to-peer cooperation among citizens, lack of inclusivity, prevalence of fraudulent activities, and data security and privacy concerns, to mention only a few (Dai et al., 2024 ; Khattak, 2024 ). Conversely, BCT has been praised for its potential to resolve some of these challenges (Bahrepour & Maleki, 2024 ). BCT has gained significant recognition related to various aspects of sustainable and smart cities, as evidenced in the literature. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of several BCT-based initiatives and platforms designed to promote societal resilience. Several projects have also explored the application of BCT in enhancing the urban environment. Despite the broad research conducted on the contributions of BCT to various SDGs such as gender equality and inclusion (SDG 5), poverty eradication (SDG 1), and economic growth (SDG 8) (di Vaio et al., 2023 ; França et al., 2020 ; Kshetri, 2017a ; Govindan, 2022 ), a notable gap remains regarding the specific implications of BCT for achieving SDG 11, as well as the potential benefits and challenges related to various aspects of sustainable cities. Bridging this research gap is not only crucial for identifying current obstacles and providing directions for future research endeavors, it is also essential for facilitating the realization of the ultimate goal of sustainability. This study fills this gap by investigating the implications of BCT for SDG 11 through a systematic scoping review. Exploring the advantages and disadvantages of BCT in the various domains and targets of SDG 11 will facilitate a better understanding of its potential in urban sustainability development. This paper highlights the potential BCT has to promote sustainability in housing and construction, transportation, public participation, heritage preservation, disaster management, air quality monitoring, waste management, development planning, disaster risk reduction, and sustainable construction, as well as aid in the tracking of missing and affected individuals and fatalities after disasters and provide protection against physical or sexual harassment. While the existing literature has mainly emphasized the benefits of BCT for achieving different SDGs, it is equally important to address the challenges and potential issues associated with this technology. These issues encompass both the challenges associated with the technology's implementation, such as social and economic barriers, and factors that could deter its widespread adoption, such as the emergence of novel crimes. These aspects span political, economic, social, technical, legal, and security dimensions. While BCT implementation has the potential to improve sustainable cities and communities, it can also introduce new problems like promulgating illegal activities, regional disparities, exacerbating implementation costs, and increasing energy consumption, as well as unfairly advantaging more developed regions. By systematically examining various challenges, this study provides valuable insights that will assist in overcoming such obstacles, ultimately facilitating the large-scale adoption of BCT in the promotion of sustainable cities.  2 Theoretical background 2.1 Sustainable development goal 11 During the launch of the SDGs, former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon emphasized that the fate of sustainable development rests in the success or failure of cities, stating that "cities are where the battle for sustainable development will be won or lost" (Fabre, 2017 ). Based on a systematic approach and with an emphasis on the cross-linkage with other development priorities, SDG 11 was designed to achieve the desired outcomes by 2030. It established a set of realistic goals and metrics intended to direct local-level policy decisions (Vaidya & Chatterji, 2020 ), including 10 targets (seven of which are "outcome targets" and the other three "means of achieving targets") and 15 indicators used to measure progress (UN, 2023 ). SDG 11 is either directly or indirectly connected to all of the other SDGs (see Fig. 1  ). Based on the SDG 11 synthesis report given in the 2018 United Nations High-level Political Forum, around one-third of the 234 indicators that are part of the global monitoring framework can be met, either directly and indirectly, through SDG 11 (Report, 2018 ). The same report also indicated that the realization of SDG 11 would contribute to the fulfillment of other global agendas, such as the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, New Urban Agenda, and Paris Climate Change Agreement (Habitat, 2018 ). Undoubtedly, moving towards the realization of SDG 11 is an essential step in achieving a sustainable and developed world (Fabre, 2017 ). Hence, there is a growing number of studies presenting various strategies and plans for implementing SDG 11. The use of different types of technologies has also emerged as an evident trend in recent years.  2.2 Blockchain technology Despite the widespread belief that BCT was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, some researchers have argued that it emerged before the publication of his white paper (Vacchio & Bifulco, 2022 ; Yermack, 2017 ). In the 1990s, Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta proposed a practical procedure for the digital time-stamping of documents in their study entitled “How to Time Stamp Digital Documents.” Their procedure made it infeasible for a user to back- or forward-date a document, even with the collusion of a time-stamping service (Haber & Stornetta, 1991 ). Nevertheless, the technology remained unused and the patent expired in 2004, four years before Bitcoin was created. In general, blockchain is a continuously growing chain of blocks capable of preserving all committed transactions via a public ledger, with each cryptographically authenticated and signed by all mining nodes. The word “blockchain” is derived from the amalgamation of the words “block” and “chain,” referring to a decentralized distributed database that is organized as a chain of blocks linked together by a reference hash from each previous block (hash block). Commonly, a block includes a block body (that contains the transactions and transaction counter) and header (that contains metadata like a nonce, nBits, timestamp, parent block hash, Merkle tree root hash, or block version; see Fig. 2  ) (Bhushan et al., 2020 ). Essentially, a transaction is a data structure that represents the transfer of digital assets between peers in a blockchain network; it is propagated through the network via the gossip (or epidemic) protocol. Blockchain uses asymmetric cryptographic mechanisms such as digital signatures to confirm a transaction's validity. Every network participant has a public and private key pair. The public key is visible to everyone distributed throughout the network and utilized to decrypt a transaction, whereas the private key is used to encrypt or sign a transaction (Fang et al., 2020 ). The utility of BCT significantly improved with the emergence of smart contracts, which are self-executing codes that can autonomously execute contract contents after satisfying pre-set obligations (Li & Kassem, 2021 ). In the BCT environment, smart contracts can read transaction information as inputs and link to user-defined functions, allowing activities to be created without any intermediaries or physical paperwork. 2.2.1 Main types of blockchain Blockchain systems are categorized into four types, based on their control mechanisms and authentication: public, private, hybrid, and consortium. 2.2.1.1 Public blockchain A public blockchain is a decentralized open-source network that allows anyone to join and mine, regardless of organization. All participating nodes have complete freedom to engage in activities such as reading, writing, reviewing, and auditing the blockchain (Irresberger et al., 2021 ). A public blockchain lacks user permission mechanisms for concealing data from specific entities, people, or the general public. For example, if the blockchain is used to store personal medical or financial information, it is accessible to anyone in the world. Such networks can be slow, congested, and costly. Blocks only retain a finite amount of data, and since anyone can use a public blockchain to send and receive transactions (i.e., data), the network can become clogged. Whenever there is a high number of activities on a blockchain, transactions can take a long time to process and network fees rise (Zheng et al., 2018 ). This type of blockchain is widely employed for cryptocurrency trading and mining. Bitcoin and Ethereum are both well-known examples of public blockchains.  2.2.1.2 Private blockchain A private blockchain is not decentralized, but rather a distributed ledger that runs as a closed database protected by cryptographic principles and tailored to meet the specific needs of the organization. Only those who have authorization can run a complete node, perform transactions, or validate/authenticate blockchain updates. Private blockchains emphasize privacy, security, and the confidentiality of all data stored within the system. With fewer nodes and participants controlling the network, the system can handle more transactions per second and accelerate the decision-making process. The features of private blockchains make them suitable for financial organizations and medical records.  2.2.1.3 Hybrid blockchain A hybrid blockchain is a type of blockchain network that mixes the features of both public and private blockchains and is controlled by only one entity. It allows an organization to control what information will be accessible to the public and who will be able to access specific data stored on the blockchain (Alkhateeb et al., 2022 ). With a hybrid blockchain, a company can flexibly modify the ledger to meet the needs of the network or individuals. This blockchain's scalability is superior to that of public blockchains, and its transactions less expensive because it relies on a small number of nodes for validation. However, this type of blockchain is not transparent, since the information recorded is not always accessible. Moreover, participants on this network are rewarded for their contributions to the blockchain in the same way that miners in a public blockchain are.  2.2.1.4 Consortium blockchain A consortium blockchain, also known as a federated blockchain, is privately owned, but not by a single entity or individual. This type of blockchain is designed by a group of entities desiring to employ a decentralized network to collaborate. Users outside the consortium are unable to access the blockchain. Unlike other types of blockchains, this network does not charge its users any service or transaction fees. R3 is a popular example of a consortium blockchain. It has digitalized financial services and enables the secure exchange of value in regulated industries where trust is critical (Li et al., 2021b ).   2.2.2 Consensus protocol The consensus mechanism operating at the foundation of a blockchain network provides a precise technique for determining whether a transaction is valid. A consensus protocol helps achieve agreement between the blockchain nodes regarding a value or network state, and determines who and when to add a new block to the chain (Xu et al., 2023 ). The consensus mechanism must make trade-offs among consistency, availability, and partition fault tolerance. Additionally, the consensus protocol must solve the Byzantine Generals Problem, which is caused by hostile nodes purposefully weakening the consensus process. A vast spectrum of consensus protocols with various concepts and properties (e.g., improved scalability, lower energy consumption, smaller latency, higher throughput, etc.) have been developed by scientists and researchers. Thus, choosing the best and most suitable consensus protocol for a particular blockchain system is crucial. Fig. 3   explains the most commonly used consensus protocols. A blockchain consensus protocol has four main components: (1) the block proposal, which involves choosing the nodes that will have the writing right to propose new blocks; (2) block validation, which involves verification of a created block and its contained transactions through participating nodes; (3) block finalization, which determines whether to add the new block to the distributed ledger; and (4) incentive mechanism, which provides motivation to promote node participation. The consensus protocol plays an essential role in choosing a blockchain suitable for a particular application (Oyinloye et al., 2021 ). Although multiple consensus protocols are available for blockchain-based systems, their basic components are the same. The design of the four critical components is the main difference.    3 Review method A systematic literature review is a rigorous approach to reviewing relevant literature; it involves a highly organized, structured, and transparent process. The goal is to produce the most accurate, dependable, verifiable, and robust research findings by applying a strict set of criteria in the selection, analysis, and synthesis of the studies (Kraus et al., 2020 ). A systematic scoping review approach was used in the present research. Scoping reviews are most useful when a body of literature has not yet been comprehensively reviewed (such as with research on the benefits and disadvantages of blockchain for sustainable cities and communities) (Peters et al., 2015 ). Systematic scoping reviews are distinct from full systematic reviews in terms of the level of specificity of the research question. While systematic reviews are characterized by a high degree of specificity, scoping reviews are more exploratory (Grant & Booth, 2009 ). One of the most important aspects of a review is the development of proper inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure that the relevant literature is identified. It is critical to use appropriate online search engines to locate scientific peer-reviewed work. For the present review, Web of Science, Springer, ScienceDirect, Emerald, Frontiers, MDPI, Taylor and Francis, Wiley Online Library, and Scopus were used. The time span of publications was set to between January 2010 and April 2024 to ensure that the review included the most recent and up-to-date studies on the topic. Additionally, as English is the common language of peer-reviewed scientific literature, only studies written in English were included in this review. The careful selection of relevant keywords that aligned with the purpose of the study was also of paramount importance. After finding results based on searching the keyword “blockchain,” other specific keywords were selected to identify the contributions of blockchain to SDG 11 and its indicators and targets. Table 1   shows the selected keywords and number of hits for each of the targets. Table 1  provides insights into the domains related to sustainable cities and communities that received the most attention from BCT researchers. Topics associated with key words such as “economic,” “finance,” “supply chain,” and “monitoring” attracted significant traction. After identifying relevant studies and removing duplicates (547 detected after the initial search), the screening phase began, in which titles and abstracts were read to identify suitable studies. Then, in the next phase, a full-text evaluation of the remaining studies was conducted. To ensure impartiality, two authors independently reviewed the full-text. In cases where there was a disagreement on the selection of an article, a senior reviewer was consulted to evaluate the paper and make the final decision. A flow chart of this systematic scoping review is shown in Fig. 4  .  4 Findings and discussion This section discusses the various benefits and advantages of using BCT to achieve SDG 11. To provide an overview of this section, Fig. 5   presents the key BCT contributions to realizing SDG 11. 4.1 Target 11.1: access for all to adequate, safe, and affordable housing Worldwide access to affordable and safe housing has long been a key concern of the international development community (Soederberg, 2017 ). More than 1.6 billion people (nearly 20 % of the world's population) lack suitable housing, with an estimated 100 million being homeless (Adabre et al., 2020 ; Adetooto & Windapo, 2022 ). Previous research has shown that nearly 26 barriers exist that hinder access to sustainable affordable housing (Adabre et al., 2020 ). These barriers include rent control policies, expensive sustainable building materials and technologies, limited private partnerships, inadequate incentives for private investors, lack of policies regarding land use planning, and zoning limits on land used for affordable housing projects, among others. Blockchain can narrow the housing-affordability gap and act as a potential solution to certain recognized barriers. Researchers have explored various methods to leverage BCT for cost reductions in land and construction, including effective land management and optimized construction processes. 4.1.1 Land management The greatest expense in the housing market is land, which is a prerequisite for housing (Yii et al., 2022 ). Research has indicated that the process of acquiring land in numerous countries, particularly developing nations, is hampered by various difficulties. These may include the occurrence of multiple sales, presence of unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles, unofficial fees, inconsistencies in land record-keeping, involvement of unqualified intermediaries, and lack of transparency among stakeholders (Ameyaw & de Vries, 2021 ). These deficiencies can lead to various civil disputes that must be resolved in the judiciary system, resulting in a significant waste of time and money. Previous research has found that BCT can reduce expenses associated with land registration, and enhance the transparency, accuracy, and security of the process (Kaczorowska, 2019 ; Krishnapriya & Sarath, 2020 ; Ozcelik, 2024 ). Alam et al. (2022)  proposed a BCT-based solution for land management systems in Bangladesh that offered data synchronization and transparency, ease of access, and immutable records management, leading to a faster and cheaper process. The authors introduced a phase-by-phase blockchain adoption model that began with a public blockchain ledger and gradually incorporated two levels of hybrid blockchain. Their analysis showed that the proposed model would decrease the amount of travel required and overall cost of information processing and enhance accessibility to critical information (Alam et al., 2022 ).  4.1.2 Building construction processes and costs BCT has shown great potential for the construction industry, mainly when combined with technologies such as Building Information Modeling (BIM), the IoT, and AI (Asif et al., 2024 ; Mahmudnia et al., 2022 ). BCT can be applied across all stages of a building's lifecycle, including planning and design, engineering, construction, operation and maintenance, renovation, and demolition (Asif et al., 2024 ). It can be integrated with BIM throughout the lifecycle of a building to promote sustainability. In the planning stage, BCT can gather environmental data and aid in the choice of eco-friendly building materials. During the design phase, it can assist in creating energy-efficient architectural models, improve real-time communication among stakeholders, and manage logistics during the construction phase. Moreover, BCT can be paired with energy management systems to monitor a building's energy usage during its operational phase. This makes BCT a versatile tool for reducing emissions and increasing efficiency, thereby promoting sustainability throughout a building's lifecycle (Singh et al., 2023b ; Yang et al., 2023 ). The construction process is collaborative, and thus requires trust between sectors. Like other industries, it involves many intermediaries, each adding extra time and cost (Turk & Klinc, 2017 ). However, these intermediaries are often seen as adding no value for customers. BCT can address this issue by streamlining payment and cash flow throughout the construction industry (Christie & Mante, 2022 ). It also has the potential to eliminate non-value activities. Dakhli et al. (2019)  conducted a study in France to evaluate potential cost reductions in construction through the use of blockchain. The data collected from real estate developers and 56 building housing programs indicated a potential cost savings from blockchain deployment of 8.3 % of the total cost of the housing construction. BCT has also been shown to improve the construction procurement process (Kumar Singh et al., 2023 ). However, to successfully implement BCT in the construction industry, it is crucial to identify and address barriers. Kumar-Singh et al. (2023)  recognized and evaluated barriers hindering the implementation of BCT in the construction sector by applying a hybrid methodology. Their main findings indicated critical barriers such as technology immaturity, inadequacy of policy implementation, market uncertainty, unawareness among customers, and accessibility issues.   4.2 Target 11.2: access to safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transport systems Transport infrastructure is a key factor in guaranteeing the socioeconomic development of a region and thus improving quality of life through the generation of inter- and intra-city connections (Liu et al., 2015 ; Wang et al., 2018 ). Providing access to accessible, safe, affordable, and sustainable transportation systems is a primary requirement for the development of cities. However, current transportation systems are far from ideal and plagued by major issues. Air and noise pollution, inequitable access for low-income groups, high CO2  emissions, and heat island effects are a few of the most well-researched issues related to transportation (Bondemark et al., 2021 ; Jacyna et al., 2017 ; Kolbe, 2019 ; Nieuwenhuijsen, 2020 ; Wang et al., 2020a ). The incorporation of BCT into urban transportation systems has emerged as a prospective solution for some of the challenges that exist in modern transportation infrastructure. BCT can be helpful in domains such as smart urban transport, smart parking, traffic decongestion, vehicle positioning (GPS vehicles), data and energy trading, electric vehicle charging, and information exchange (Enescu et al., 2022 ; Khoshavi et al., 2021 ). Essentially, BCT can be utilized to facilitate the advancement of smart transportation in two ways: improving connections between facilities and equipment and facilitating better service. 4.2.1 Electric transportation Electric vehicles are now garnering attention in both academia and industry, due to their significant contribution to the goal of sustainable transportation. If they are to be widely adopted, it is necessary to adequately manage users’ charging needs and ensure that charging requests are satisfied without exceeding the distribution grid's capacity. The literature has widely investigated the application of BCT in energy supply and charging systems for electric vehicles, highlighting its potential for facilitating the adoption of electric vehicles. For example, Okwuibe et al. (2020)  proposed a smart electric vehicle charging infrastructure based on a blockchain platform. The suggested solution utilized a distributed ledger system to record transactions and a smart contract to automate charging processes. By implementing this solution, the researchers found that charging costs would decrease by up to 36 %, as the system could optimize charging schedules and manage energy flow more efficiently. Furthermore, energy sellers would benefit from increased revenue, with potential gains of up to 33 %, because the blockchain-based infrastructure would enable peer-to-peer trading and more flexible pricing models (Okwuibe et al., 2020 ). In a study conducted by (Li et al., 2024b ), BCT was employed to address the issue of user impatience with charging duration. The authors developed a mathematical model that integrated individual preferences for charging stations based on inferred spatial and temporal characteristics. They employed smart contracts to ensure the autonomy of the charging service and suggested a hybrid encryption algorithm to safeguard the privacy of the electric vehicle users. Their findings revealed that personalized techniques could effectively enhance charging experiences, with certain acceptable detours. There can also be side-benefits to BCT-based systems. For example, charging platforms from private energy producers and energy trading schemes based on BCT promote local renewable energy production (Du et al., 2020 ; Wu et al., 2022 ). However, there are still many aspects of electric transportation and the application of BCT that have not been thoroughly investigated. One example is the application of BCT in electric public transportation. Although electric vehicles for public transportation can be a promising solution to current transportation challenges, there is scarce research on the topic (Clairand et al., 2019 ). Public transportation is necessary for the efficient mass transfer of passengers; however, electric vehicles used for public transportation require a significant amount of power during charging times, creating a major impact on the grid. BCT has great potential to address charging challenges associated with electric vehicle-based public transportation (such as addressing the charging challenges and facilitating universal ticketing and payments), but additional research is needed to specifically investigate BCT applications in this area.  4.2.2 Traffic decongestion and parking management Excessive traffic jams and a lack of parking spaces are critical issues affecting the current transportation system. Effects of these issues include increased fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, air and noise pollution causing stress and frustration in motorists, and a negative impact on residents' well-being and mental health (Bharadwaj et al., 2017 ; Hao et al., 2022 ; Liu et al., 2019 ; Xia et al., 2022 ). Addressing these issues is a necessary step in establishing a sustainable transportation system. This literature review suggests that BCT is a possible means of reducing traffic and parking problems in cities. Providing incentives has proven successful in addressing these issues. In order to improve the accuracy of traffic congestion prediction, Hassija et al. (2020a)  proposed an advanced BCT-based secure crowdsourcing model that preserved user privacy. The model also incorporated a revenue model to increase voluntary participation in the traffic prediction process. They developed a neural network-based model to calculate the actual probability of traffic jams at a particular location and deployed an Ethereum-based smart contract for storing and validating the information shared by users in the network. The results of this study highlighted the potential for attaining substantial participation and obtaining highly accurate traffic predictions. In addition, studies have shown that searching for parking‏ is a major challenge that significantly contributes to traffic congestion and vehicles’ fuel consumption (Paidi et al., 2022 ; Shen et al., 2020 ; Tang et al., 2024 ). Research on searching for parking in congested downtowns determined that such behavior accounted for around 8 % to 74 % of traffic; on average, it took between 3.5 and 14 min to find available curbside parking spaces (Hampshire & Shoup, 2018 ). Smart parking systems have been developed to address parking problems, allowing drivers to have real-time parking information regarding vacant parking spaces (Zulfiqar et al., 2023 ). However, reliance on a central third party to organize the service has resulted in various challenges (e.g., the potential risks associated with the disclosure of personal/route/location information). BCT has demonstrated significant potential to improve fairness, reliability, and privacy protection in smart parking and increase the energy-efficiency of such systems (Ibrahim et al., 2022 ; Singh et al., 2022b ). Researchers have also explored other applications for BCT related to parking issues, such as the potential of homeowners and landowners renting out private spaces. Baza et al. (2022)  proposed a decentralized smart private parking scheme that used BCT. Parking owners/seekers would submit their offers/requests in an encrypted format, and the blockchain would identify possible matches between the encrypted requests and offers, without the need to access the original sensitive information.   4.3 Target 11.3: enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanization through citizen participation Citizen participation refers to the dynamic and inclusive process of actively engaging groups, individuals, and organizations, offering them an opportunity to contribute to decision-making that affects their lives and aligns with their interests. An adequate level of citizen inclusion allows for a redistribution of power that helps to build strong and inclusive democratic societies and reduces inequality, both crucial to creating fair and sustainable cities. For example, utilizing public participation in urban planning and environmental and socioeconomic problems empowers users (both citizens and institutions) to search together for the best solution (Bouzguenda et al., 2019 ; Mansourian et al., 2011 ). Studies have shown that citizen participation can help identify ways to improve public water policies and drought management, restore native vegetation in urban environments, reduce rural poverty, and promote the use of renewable energies (Casero-Cepeda et al., 2022 ; Flores-Galicia et al., 2024 ; Horgan & Dimitrijević, 2019 ; Huerta-Vergara & Escolero, 2024 ; Yildiz, 2014 ). As a result, different platforms and software have been developed to promote citizen participation in a variety of sectors. However, these tools may face challenges regarding the reliability and privacy of participants and transparency of their actions (Benítez-Martínez et al., 2021 ). BCT represents a substantial opportunity to promote reliable and transparent citizen participation (Benítez-Martínez et al., 2021 ). Urban planners and managers are attracted to the potential of BCT to increase the capacity for participatory and sustainable human settlement planning and management. Overall, the use cases through which BCT could promote and expand urban citizen participation include: (1) document management, (2) feedback and social network integration, (3) opinion polls and voting, (4) tokenization and participatory budgeting, and (5) crowdfunding (Ante et al., 2024 ; Azzam et al., 2023 ; Benítez-Martínez et al., 2021 ; Hassija et al., 2020b ) The following briefly explains other studies promoting public participation through BCT:• The use of crowd practices (such as crowdsourcing and crowdfunding) in modern city management has the potential to encourage residents and other interested citizens to participate in various projects (environmental, social, or commercial) and self-governance (Al Jurdi et al., 2023 ; Knauf & Wüstenhagen, 2023 ; Koniagina et al., 2021 ). However, sourcing funds, skills, and information from the public requires a high level of security and trust (Tan et al., 2021 ). BCT can solve current problems regarding the safety and trust of crowd practices and increase acceptance and willingness to participate (Hassija et al., 2020b ; Knauf & Wüstenhagen, 2023 ; Stekli & Cali, 2020 ). The secure and transparent platform provided by BCT will enable participants to verify the authenticity of transactions and ensure that their contributions are protected from fraud and manipulation.  • A public participatory geographic information system (GIS) is an underlying discipline that attempts to incorporate citizens' knowledge into urban planning and decision-making (Mukherjee, 2015 ). Farnaghi and Mansourian (2020)  suggested that public participatory GIS should be developed as Decentralized Applications (DApp) based on Ethereum, to provide a fully open, transparent, and accountable environment for public participation. A prototype public participatory GIS was developed as a DApp, through which users could participate in site selection for urban facilities. In this method, the validity of the data, replicated on the nodes of the peer-to-peer blockchain network, was safeguarded through a consensus process and without any central control. This method showed promise for effectively addressing the requirements of openness, transparency, and accountability in the planning process.  • To address the limitations of traditional, single-agency emergency management systems and support various responders with a unified platform for decision-making and coordination during emergency operations, Wang and Chen (2022)  leveraged BCT's potential to develop a multi-agent collaborative participation framework. This framework enabled various stakeholders such as emergency responders, local authorities, and citizens to collaborate and share information in a secure, transparent, and decentralized manner. By utilizing BCT's features such as smart contracts, immutable records, and consensus mechanisms, the framework provided a trusted and efficient platform for managing emergency response. The use of BCT also helped reduce the risk of data breaches, delays in communication, and conflicts among different agencies, all common issues in traditional emergency management systems.     4.4 Target 11.4: strengthen efforts to protect and safeguard the world's cultural and natural heritage Urban cultural heritage is the physical representation of a community identity that is to be passed on to the next generation. Historic urban areas have a key role in defining the distinctiveness of a city and improving competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world; as such, they directly contribute to the social well-being of groups living in urban areas (Guzmán et al., 2017 ). Therefore, preserving the cultural heritage and historic areas of cities is a core value of a sustainable society. However, there has been little recognition of their importance and scant public policy protecting their preservation (Li et al., 2024a ; Zukin, 2012 ) . In old Beijing, for example, 51.6 % of the historic architectural district has been lost in the last four decades, due to the gradual development of urban functions and even distribution of facilities (Wang et al., 2023 ). Moreover, these valuable areas are becoming increasingly vulnerable to natural and man-made hazards such as earthquakes, floods, extreme heat, fires, cyclones, and vandalism (Jigyasu, 2016 ; Kumari & Kitchley, 2024 ; Quesada-Ganuza et al., 2023 ). For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted cultural sector and heritage preservation, resulting in a 52 % drop in income from admission fees (UNESCO, 2020 ). The pandemic also negatively affected 78 % of communities living in and around world heritage sites. SDG 11 targets protection of the world's cultural and natural heritage. The only indicator of Target 4 concerns the tracking of expenditures (both public and private) for the preservation and protection of cultural and/or natural heritage over time. BCT is a potential solution, due to its transparency and decentralization. Whitaker et al. (2021)  investigated BCT's potential for cultural heritage restitution, highlighting the technology's ability to unify cultural heritage and education, secure stewardship and historical preservation, and produce a positive social effect. Moreover, BCT facilitates access to cultural goods and encourages growth in cities through: (a) improved copyright control (tracking of ownership and provenance), (b) increased public and private investment in culture, (c) the attraction of creative investors, (d) provision of reliable information, (e) reduced transaction costs, and (f) introduction of new possibilities for public funding of cultural goods (Malik et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, BCT can serve the cultural heritage of cities in various other ways. The metaverse is being explored as a means of sustainability and cultural preservation. Replicas known as “digital twins” can be created through a meticulous survey of a relic, which can then be saved for posterity. A cultural heritage metaverse would protect tangible and intangible information that could be used for data collection, sharing, storing, presentation, and conservation, as well as restoration, protection, monitoring, research, and inheritance (Zhang et al., 2022 ). Additionally, the transportation of cultural relics is a critical area of work, requiring cooperation among museums and special prevention mechanisms to avoid risk. By leveraging BCT and IoT technology, Zhang et al. (2021)  developed a cultural relic transport monitoring and management system that could record several parameters to reflect real-time conditions including temperature, relative humidity, triaxial acceleration, angular speed, roll angle, pitch angle, and GPS location. They then used BCT to distribute the data in real time, directing the information flow between the transport vehicles and to the commissioners, creating a consensus network with advanced encryption. Additionally, the digitalization of museums would reduce the need for transportation and maximize cultural, scientific, and economic value (Zhao et al., 2023b ). However, in traditional digital collection systems, data exchange is easily manipulated, particularly when untrusted internal users tamper with the stored exchange data or in cases of attack by external hackers. BCT could be used to solve problems of trust, security, and regulatory governance in the exchange of digital museum collections. Zhao et al. (2023a)  built a digital collection exchange system using Ethereum to realize a digital collection's online exchange between two museums. In order to avoid fraud, illegal fundraising, money laundering, and smuggling, they constructed a regulatory mechanism with an SM2-based dual receiver public key encryption algorithm. Through a case study, they showed that the system was feasible, secure, and expandable and could effectively promote the exchange of collections between museums, a result of great significance to the promotion of cultural heritage and dissemination of scientific knowledge.  4.5 Target 11.5: reduce the adverse effects of natural disasters Cities face significant risks from extreme events and natural disasters; consequently, increasing the social, economic, and environmental resilience of cities has become a top priority. The two indicators of Target 11.5 focus on the adverse effects of natural disasters on residents, critical infrastructure, and the economy. The first indicator is measured by the number of deaths, missing persons, and directly affected persons that can be attributed to disasters. The second indicator is quantified based on economic loss in relation to global GDP, damage to critical infrastructure, and the number of disruptions to basic services. Applications of BCT in post-disaster management and reducing the impacts of natural disasters are topics that have been widely studied. 4.5.1 Telecommunications for basic services In the aftermath of a natural disaster, effective emergency management operations (such as providing food, water, shelter, and medicine) rely on communications infrastructure. Telecommunications infrastructure is considered an essential basic service that could break down after such events. The existing means of preserving communication when infrastructure malfunctions focuses on utilizing temporary infrastructure such as mobile telecom towers. These centralized methods rely heavily on equipment that can be damaged during a disaster, potentially rendering them unavailable when needed most. To address these issues, Ilbeigi et al. (2022)  proposed a novel decentralized and infrastructure-free communications system that used an ad hoc mobile network (MANET), BCT, and all-to-all broadcasting routing algorithm. In this method, mobile devices in the impacted area could connect with one another over device-to-device Wi-Fi Direct, creating a temporary mobile ad hoc network for the purpose of sharing spatial information. In the final step of the process, each device in the network would have the spatial data of all available devices in the area. Therefore, when first responders arrived in the impacted area, they could find all devices and immediately obtain access to all collected information through a direct connection to only one device in the area. The process would significantly reduce the duration of rescue operations by assisting first responders in quickly and efficiently locating citizens in the affected area. Moreover, telecommunications for providing medical treatment after a disaster is of the highest priority, and telemedicine has shown great potential to help meet this need. A relatively new field, telemedicine is defined as the remote delivery of healthcare services over the telecommunications infrastructure. Telemedicine offer clinical assistance that overcomes geographical barriers, and studies have demonstrated that BCT has significant potential for advancing the practice (Ahmad et al., 2021 ). Instead of collecting medical data in the cloud, which can leak or be tampered with, a variety of BCT-based means have been proposed to overcome current medical data security problems. Adoption of BCT establishes the legitimacy of users looking for patient data, enhancing trust among telehealth and telemedicine participants. It also preserves patient anonymity, manages the identities of devices utilized for remote patient monitoring, determines the provenance of clinical data, and automates payment (Ahmad et al., 2021 ; Dubovitskaya et al., 2017 ; Wang et al., 2021 ).  4.5.2 Search and rescue missions Search and Rescue (SAR) missions are complex operations that combine various activities and actions from different disciplines, all with the goal of locating and aiding persons in dangerous situations. The area is considered a critical part of post-disaster management. In order to reduce the adverse effects of a natural disaster, SAR missions must be rigorously executed. Traditional SAR equipment is inefficient in difficult situations where there is a lack of access, visibility, and GPS availability. These challenges have been overcome by new methods and the application of different types of unmanned autonomous vehicles (Chatziparaschis et al., 2020 ; Nguyen et al., 2023 ). As these entities communicate wirelessly and are connected directly to the internet, they are associated with several security issues. Generally, such issues stem from unprotected WiFi, GPS attacks, manipulation of flight control settings, and access to configuration of the entities. For example, drone hijacking programs like Sky Jack are designed to wirelessly hack and assume control of drones (Gupta et al., 2021 ). Gupta et al., (2021)  argued that BCT could be used to make unmanned vehicles safer through greater accuracy and ease of control. Due to the inter-coordination of unmanned vehicles passing secure information between one another, communication between unmanned vehicles is a suitable candidate for BCT implementation. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are one of the best types of unmanned vehicle for search missions after a disaster, but they are vulnerable to mid-air collisions. When the UAV network is congested, there is a high probability of routs clashing with one another, due to a delays in the command signal received or a channel blockage in the path of the signals from the ground control station (Alladi et al., 2020 ; Gupta et al., 2021 ). In a review of BCT applications for UAVs, Alladi et al., (2020)  indicated that UAVs could maintain a safe distance from others while moving toward their destination if each had an onboard blockchain that kept the information on the flight routes of peer UAVs. This approach would reduce the delays and errors of a manual signaling system (Alladi et al., 2020 ).  4.5.3 Tracking missing and affected individuals and fatalities Few countries are completely spared from events that result in significant fatalities (Kiv et al., 2016 ). Studies have shown that current victim identification systems face several difficulties in tracking missing persons and identifying the deceased in cases of natural disasters (Byard & Winskog, 2010 ). Effective implementation of the disaster victim identification process depends on the creation, collection, and integration of significant amounts of heterogeneous data, and ensuring that the right person has access to the right resources at the right time to make the most accurate identification (Seba et al., 2019 ). BCT has the ability to enable an effective disaster victim identification process (McIsaac et al., 2019 ). In a typical blockchain-based identity management system, there are many distributed nodes (Lim et al., 2018 ). These nodes are used to provide distributed storage, reliable access, and computation capabilities. The user acts as a node in the network, allowing for the storage of sensitive user information to shift from servers (in conventional identity management methods) to user devices/nodes (in the blockchain-based model) (Liu et al., 2020 ). Alsalamah and Nuzzolese (2020)  clarified how BCT can address current challenges related to post-disaster missing person problems, describing the creation of a distributed ledger in which the details of all disaster victims and their associated information are recorded as individual entries in a blockchain, each marked with a specific time stamp. The ledger is distributed among disaster victim identification members through various jurisdictions, so that the missing persons list can be systematically updated. Any updates relevant to a specific victim can be added at any time to the blockchain via the victim's unique assigned number, and a new timestamp applied to indicate updates. This would make it easier to identify individuals recovered across various jurisdictions, by comparing information with missing person reports filed by relatives (Alsalamah & Nuzzolese, 2020 ).   4.6 Target 11.6: reduce cities' air quality and waste management impact SDG 11.6, which focuses on mitigating environmental degradation in urban areas, is designed to reduce air and waste pollution. This goal is pursued through two key indicators. The first pertains to the effective management and decrease of urban waste, and the second emphasizes the monitoring and control of air pollution by measuring particulate matter. 4.6.1 Waste management and a circular economy To address the recent substantial rise in solid waste generation, cities have adopted waste management practices as a direct response to the adverse environmental impact caused by mass production, high consumption rates, short material lifespans, product obsolescence, and non-repairable parts. Waste management in cities involves various stakeholders, including individuals, companies, and municipalities. Despite several proposed solutions outlined in the literature, significant challenges remain in the effective management of waste. These challenges encompass access control issues, a limited understanding of product life cycles, insufficient incentives, scalability problems, and validity concerns related to experiments, among others (Sahoo et al., 2021 ). Consequently, the potential of BCT-based solutions for addressing these challenges has been widely investigated. In their review of BCT applications in waste management, Jiang et al. (2023)  highlighted five key areas in which blockchain-related technologies could enhance waste management practices. These areas include data traceability, consensus mechanisms, distributed ledger systems, smart contracts, and the integration of blockchain and IoT. BCT's data traceability enables effective tracking of essential information throughout the various stages of waste management, improving both data management and analysis (Chen & Jin, 2021 ). Moreover, the progression of consensus protocols in blockchain applications offers technical support to improve trust, information transparency, and security. Integration of consensus and encryption algorithms enhances information security, reduces the chance of data forgery and tampering, and increases the efficiency of waste management regulation (Wang et al., 2022 ). The distributed ledger feature ensures that information cannot be manipulated and enables effective tracking. It also has the potential to replace paper documents and cash transactions in the traditional recycling chain, leading to improved efficiency and safety (Ajwani-Ramchandani et al., 2021 ; Gong et al., 2022 ). Smart contracts would enable the easy and transparent enforcement of waste management rules. Using a waste collection network (including waste disposal companies, waste collection sites/stations, and other participants) and smart contracts, BCT would facilitate more timely waste collection. Smart contracts could be developed and used to define requirements for waste collection based on factors like location, time, waste type, quality, volume of waste, etc. (Jiang et al., 2023 ). Finally, the integration of IoT and blockchain would improve communication between managers and residents with regards to the waste recycling process and establish a unified system where all waste management operations could be coordinated (Lim et al., 2021 ). Several studies have investigated the vast potential of BCT for use in urban waste management. In order to enhance solid waste processing and address financial concerns, Gopalakrishnan et al. (2021)  introduced a blockchain-based model where the municipality, acting as the custodian of the waste management service, facilitates financial transactions and other interactions between producer and consumer companies. Similarly, França et al. (2020)  proposed an application that leveraged Ethereum's blockchain architecture for waste management in small cities, showing the potential of this application to replace traditional paperwork and effectively engage volunteer citizens and store owners. In their review, Steenmans et al. (2021)  examined 21 studies on plastic waste management using BCT, showing that most were in early development stages and focused on areas such as cryptocurrency-based payments, reuse/recycling incentives, waste tracing, and smart contracts. The authors emphasized BCT's potential to support regulatory compliance, operationalize waste management, and enable effective analysis. Additionally, other research has explored BCT's applicability in managing electronic, hospital, and other waste types (Bamakan et al., 2022 ; Chen & Ogunseitan, 2021 ; Sahoo et al., 2021 ). Castiglione et al. (2023)  proposed a framework utilizing BCT to achieve a circular economy for sustainable urban waste management systems. The framework would enhance monitoring capabilities while reducing overall waste management costs. By adopting this blockchain system, complete traceability of waste, transparency of action, and direct verification of stored information such as disposal quantities, rewards, and additional data could be made possible for every customer. Additionally, the framework incorporated a reward system derived from effective waste management, resulting in cost-effective and profit-maximizing solutions. In addition to solid waste management, wastewater processing would also benefit from the utilization of BCT. Research has highlighted the potential advantages of blockchain for effectively managing both the quantity and quality of wastewater, as well as serving as an economic incentive to promote wastewater reuse (Kaur & Oza., 2020 ; Pandey et al., 2022 ; Rathi & Kumar, 2022 ; Sundaresan et al., 2021 ).  4.6.2 Air quality monitoring Conventional air pollution systems typically rely on a centralized architecture and human involvement in data retrieval. Such systems often occupy significant physical space and demand a substantial power supply (Idrees & Zheng, 2020 ; Sofia et al., 2020 ). The integration of BCT with emerging technologies such as IoT, 5G, and neural networks presents new possibilities for real-time monitoring and control of air pollution (Han et al., 2019 ; Sakila et al., 2023 ). These studies highlighted that BCT could safeguard against data forgery and tampering while effectively managing contaminants in large-scale industrial settings. In addition, several researchers have suggested that BCT-based air pollution monitoring could reduce the cost of data storage and transactions, in parallel to an increase in data reliability (Sofia et al., 2020 ).   4.7 Target 11.7: equal access to safe, inclusive, and accessible public places The lack of public space access is one of numerous issues arising from rapid urbanization. Challenges concerning locations, entry convenience, and safety measures hinder the public's ability to utilize communal areas. Indicators related to Target 11.7 focus on ensuring fair access to public spaces and reducing instances of physical and sexual harassment. BCT has the potential to address these indicators by offering novel solutions. 4.7.1 Equitable access to public spaces Public spaces encompass diverse locations, including outdoor settings like parks, streets, and beaches, as well as indoor areas such as libraries, schools, and governmental buildings. Ensuring equitable access to these spaces necessitates the integration of environmental factors derived from satellite imagery, remote sensing data, and socio-economic variables. By integrating these diverse elements, planners can optimize the design of urban areas to promote equitable accessibility (Patino & Duque, 2013 ; Razzaq et al., 2022 ). Satellite data and technological advancements are crucial in urban planning, particularly in relation to public space accessibility, but in some countries, corruption can obstruct unified planning and undermine equitable allocation of public investments, favoring the few over the many (Alexander et al., 2022 ; Garay & Henderson, 2021 ). Consequently, the need to preserve a secure way of storing, sharing, and even trading such data is evident (Usama et al., 2010 ). Limitations primarily stem from centralized platforms that offer these services (Liu et al., 2022 ). To address these issues, researchers have proposed BCT-based models for spatial data transactions (Liu et al., 2022 ; Razzaq et al., 2022 ; Usama et al., 2010 ). BCT enhances security and resilience in data storage, sharing, pricing, retrieval, and evaluation, thereby mitigating the risk of data manipulation by corrupt actors seeking to alter urban planning information.  4.7.2 Physical and sexual harassment prevention The second indicator of Target 7 focuses on physical abuse and sexual misconduct, which affects individuals across different age groups, genders, and levels of ability. The target particularly emphasizes locations where such harassment takes place. Research has found that the issue of child labor significantly heightens the likelihood of experiencing physical harassment, particularly among the young, because it creates an environment that is conducive to physical abuse and sexual persecution (Moayad et al., 2021 ; Dhakal et al., 2023 ). BCT-based contracts offer a promising solution to mitigate the risks faced by children in the workforce. For example, Senou et al. (2019)  introduced a BCT-based model utilizing smart contracts that required companies (specifically those engaged in cocoa production in West and Central Africa, chosen to serve as case studies) to ensure appropriate working conditions for child laborers. Schools are also public places where physical abuse and bullying can endanger young peoples’ health. Ersotelos et al. (2020)  showed that the integration of a private permission blockchain platform with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) would allow for the real-time recording of disturbances. This integration would enable the detection of prohibited events, which would be particularly beneficial for students with chronic conditions and disabilities. Moreover, BCT has shown promise in promoting gender equality and fostering inclusive opportunities for women in society (di Vaio et al., 2023 ; Evans & Vincent, 2021 ; Thylin & Duarte, 2019 ). The proof of witness consensus protocol has emerged as a dependable method for providing testimony and evidence in cases of sexual crimes and other criminal activities. By leveraging this mechanism, individuals would have the power to actively intervene and provide testimony, rather than passively observe the actions of others (Pournaras, 2020 ). This approach would facilitate the process of proving crimes in court, a crucial step in seeking justice for victims in cases where there are eyewitnesses to an incident. Moreover, the protocol would provide protection for witnesses, ensuring their safety and enabling them to come forward in safety (Lone & Mir, 2019 ). The adoption of BCT would fortify systems against evidence tampering, ensuring that such documents would remain admissible. Many studies, especially in forensic medicine, have demonstrated BCT's potential to improve legal procedures and identify victims of sexual crimes (Al-Khateeb et al., 2019 ; Kumar et al., 2021a ; Li et al., 2021a ; Lone and Mir, 2019 ; Ryu et al., 2019 ).   4.8 Target 11.a: strengthening development planning to support economic, social, and environmental links This target emphasizes the importance of empowering regional and national development planning. The indicator focuses on three key aspects: responding to population dynamics, ensuring balanced territorial development, and increasing local fiscal space. 4.8.1 Responding to population dynamics Recognizing the spatial and temporal dynamics of urban populations is crucial to the design and development of urban areas that respond to diverse human needs. This is imperative for various reasons, including facilitating access to different locations, mitigating exposure to pollutants, and preventing the spreading of diseases such as COVID-19. However, due to the asynchrony of the population in urban areas, estimation of the population distribution at a fine resolution is challenging (Liu et al., 2018 ). One promising approach to accessing this information is through the use of mobile phone data. Mobile phone data offer easy and inexpensive access to information on population movements and relocations. Researchers have used such data to estimate population densities, track migration patterns, and even predict the spread of disease. However, several challenges exist, including the risk of information misuse and privacy violations. BCT can ensure the cybersecurity of information obtained from many mobile crowdsensing devices such as smartphones, tablets, and wearables, as well as any device equipped with sensors (Chen et al., 2021 ; Deepa et al., 2022 ; Kshetri, 2017b ; Taylor et al., 2020 ). Through the improvement of cybersecurity measures in crowdsensing devices, networks based on BCT have the potential to facilitate the acquisition of precise and trustworthy data. This enhanced data quality could greatly contribute to informed decision-making and effective urban development planning. Moreover, BCT-based networks can promote participation in the general public, improving inclusiveness and the transparency of urban planning initiatives (Farnaghi & Mansourian, 2020 ).  4.8.2 Ensuring balanced territorial development There are many terms that apply when speaking of the concept of territorial development. Among them, one of the most important “cohesion” (Maier, 2012 ). Gonzalez and de Melo (2021)  showed that cohesion and integration are key factors in teamwork, supporting dynamic capabilities and encouraging a positive relationship with the absorption, generation, storage, and adaptation of knowledge in organizational performance. Therefore, cohesion and integration are essential to balanced territorial development, and BCT can be a potential solution for achieving the two. Lapygin et al. (2022)  proposed a cluster approach incorporated with the principles of BCT as a method for integrating organizations in regional development. The authors argued that the decentralization, transparency of transactions, and reliability of their method would allow for better organization in the interaction between economic entities operating in regional and interregional development. The decentralization feature of BCT would help ensure that all regions have a say in the development process and benefit from it. Many studies have also highlighted the opportunities offered by BCT to enhance government collaboration on territorial development, from “distributed collaborative organizations” to “green” sustainable regional development (Scott et al., 2017 ; Moşteanu, 2020 ). The effectiveness of BCT is influenced by the specific manner in which it is implemented and used. However, unresolved concerns remain, such as the necessity for governance and regulation, as well as the potential for unequal technology access in different regions.  4.8.3 Increasing local fiscal space To increase local fiscal space, researchers have proposed the utilization of BCT as a way to overcome various challenges faced in remote areas. Schuetz and Venkatesh (2020)  suggested using BCT to strengthen the links between remote areas and local and global supply chains, in order to overcome the challenges of location access, high cost, inappropriate banking services, and financial illiteracy. Similarly, Tan and Zhang (2021)  presented a BCT-based hierarchical model for rural green credit for green investigation, showing that the model enhanced the reliability and security of the data. In a qualitative study conducted by Enayati et al., (2024) , the researchers explored the potential of BCT to enhance the livelihood security of rural fishing communities. The findings revealed that BCT had the potential to address marketing challenges faced by rural fishermen by enabling them to market their catch independently and connect with a wider customer base. Also, Merrell (2022)  addressed the marginalization of rural areas in the global economy by proposing the use of BCT for rural development and governance in regional discussions, emphasizing its potential to overcome political and fiscal challenges related to accountability, transparency, and overall socio-economic progression.   4.9 Target 11.b: disaster risk reduction Between 1998 and 2017, catastrophic events led to approximately 1.3 million casualties, affected over 4.4 billion individuals, and resulted in economic losses surpassing 2,908 billion USD (Wallemacq et al., 2018 ). Between 1970 and 2010, South Asia alone experienced 1,333 major disasters, which had far-reaching consequences affecting 2.4 million individuals, causing a loss of 105 billion USD, and resulting in a devastating casualty count of 980,000 (Ahmed, 2013 ). Target 11.b places significant emphasis on addressing natural disasters, aligning with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 and comprehensive disaster risk management. The Sendai framework provides quantitative indicators for nations to use in measuring progress in disaster risk reduction, increasing understanding of the effectiveness of various strategies and interventions (Wilkins et al., 2021 ). However, there are still challenges related to data and reporting, such as data storage, formatting, and security issues (Wilkins et al., 2021 ). BCT could address these problems, due to its inherent data management capabilities. In addition, for natural hazards, BCT could play a vital role in minimizing casualties, physical damage, infrastructure interruption, and future interactions, as well as reduce insufficiencies unique to transboundary disasters (Wang & Chen, 2022 ). In 2015, the UN officially endorsed the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, which outlines four key priorities and seven targets related to disaster risk reduction. The overall goals can be summarized into four main topics: (1) logistics and blockchain contribution for reducing disaster mortality and affected people, (2) improving the supply chain and minimizing economic loss, (3) reducing damage to critical infrastructure, and (4) improving multi-hazard early warning systems and disaster risk information. Fulfilling the four main components of the Sendai framework would also satisfy the two indicators specified in Target 11.b. Although in our discussion of Target 5 we highlighted several BCT techniques that could reduce the adverse impacts of natural disasters, in the following, we focus on BCT applications in the Sendai framework and how BCT could enhance its implementation. 4.9.1 Logistics and BCT contribution to reducing disaster mortality and number of people affected Effective disaster response requires strong coordination among multiple stakeholders, including government agencies, public assistance organizations, national and international entities, military forces, and faith-based groups. In crisis management operations, proficient field coordination is crucial as it can lead to cost reductions, improved service delivery, and rapid responsiveness to the complex, dynamic, and uncertain conditions inherent in disaster situations (Cao & Zhang, 2011 ). Therefore, efficient humanitarian logistics coordination is crucial to meeting in a timely and appropriate manner the unpredictable demands and urgent needs of disaster victims, including provisions for water services, food, medicine, clothing, and blood (Nagurney et al., 2019 ; Vega & Roussat, 2015 ). In a conceptual study, researchers explored the potential of engaging commercial entities such as transporters and retailers in disaster relief efforts. They examined the utilization of sharing economy models, BCT, and existing resource allocation approaches in both commercial and humanitarian logistics (L'Hermitte & Nair, 2021 ). The authors suggested that implementing BCT in conjunction with commercial logistics resources such as emergency sources, storage space, and transport capability would enhance the mobilization and deployment of relief items and emergency response (L'Hermitte & Nair, 2021 ). Another study, this one on Indonesian relief logistics services, showed that monitoring and tracking in humanitarian logistics operations through BCT and radio frequency identification significantly enhanced trackability and overall performance (Masudin et al., 2021 ). In the aftermath of the Tabasco flood of 2007, researchers proposed an integrated solution that would leverage BCT, AI, and 3D printing. Their framework was designed to mitigate supply chain congestion, reduce lead time, enhance stakeholder collaboration, and improve the traceability, transparency, and accountability of resources. Moreover, it actively engaged affected individuals in fulfilling their own needs during a crisis (Rodríguez-Espíndola et al., 2020 ). Therefore, it is widely recognized and supported by empirical evidence that the integration of BCT into logistics can greatly enhance coordination among different players in operations and field management.  4.9.2 Improving the supply chain and minimizing economic loss Economic losses incurred during and after natural disasters represent a significant concern that requires a proactive approach focused on preventive measures to minimize and mitigate damage. BCT offers effective measures to address these challenges. It has the potential to moderate economic losses by strengthening system resilience through rapid recovery and adaptation, especially when faced with adversity, shocks, and failure-inducing conditions. Min (2019)  demonstrated an application of BCT in supply chain operations to improve resilience from a risk management perspective. The author showed the effectiveness of BCT in enhancing supply chain strength during periods of high risk and uncertainty and its potential to mitigate challenges. In another study, Li et al. (2022)  empirically examined the relationships among business models, supply chain flexibility, and robust performance through BCT, showing that it can enhance supply chain resilience by fostering agility, particularly in disaster situations. Lohmer et al. (2020)  investigated the influence of BCT on supply chain resiliency by using an agent-based model of a disrupted supply network. The research findings showed an improvement in supply chain flexibility, ultimately leading to a substantial reduction in the dispersion of disturbances, network recovery duration, and associated costs. In two other studies, BCT was used by Nandi et al. (2021)  and Sharma et al. (2022)  to improve supply chain resiliency in response to COVID-19 and reduce the risk of pandemics. Both studies reached the same conclusion, that BCT has the potential to enhance system agility and serve as a catalyst. In addition, insurance is an established and effective mechanism for compensating and restoring economic damages, but in critical situations, insurance companies face various problems with payment. BCT can enable quick payment for reconstruction by creating a transparent and secure structure. Due to its multidisciplinary system, the application of BCT in natural disaster insurance contracts has the potential to improve the influence of catastrophe risk insurance on economic resilience and offer a chance to establish pre-disaster protocols. Pagano et al. (2019)  highlighted the potential of smart contracts for use natural catastrophe insurance, underscoring the need for additional quantitative and practical research on BCT platforms for multi- or inter-disciplinary frameworks. Boustani and Elisabetta (2022)  conducted a quantitative study involving 213 businesses across diverse sectors, finding an increased acceptance of smart insurance contracts in Lebanon, a developing country experiencing both sanitation and economic crises. The authors proposed a blockchain-based insurance system that would serve as a shield during pandemic-induced business disruptions (such as those resulting from COVID-19) in developing countries.  4.9.3 Reducing damage to critical infrastructure Several studies have been conducted on leveraging BCT to enhance infrastructure performance and safety. The present research utilized the UK government's infrastructure classification "Natural Hazards and Infrastructure" as a framework for reviewing the application of BCT in infrastructure discussions (Office, 2011 ). Within the UK government guide, nine sectors have been identified as critical: energy, water, food, communication, health, emergency services, transport, finance, and government. Fig. 6   demonstrates the contributions of BCT to increasing the resilience of critical infrastructure.  4.9.4 Improving multi-hazard early warning systems and disaster risk information provision The impact of technology on cities has been significant, prompting the question of whether it could also contribute to citizens' disaster preparedness. The concept of smart city digital twins has emerged as a potential solution for disaster management, due to the its ability to accurately capture, predict, and adapt to a city's dynamics (Mohammadi & Taylor, 2021 ). One of the dimensions of smart city digital twins, intelligent feedback, refers to smart warnings of potential dangers in a city (Deren et al., 2021 ). Previous studies have shown that early warning systems utilizing digital twins can be very beneficial during environmental disasters and for construction projects (Fan et al., 2020 ; Ye et al., 2023 ). However, due to the vast number of participants constructing the complicated network necessary for managing a digital twin, data-related issues such as data storage, access, sharing, and security are problematic and may decrease the system's reliability. To address these critical issues in early warning systems, BCT could facilitate data storage and security through cryptography and ensure data sharing and access. Many studies have shown that BCT can empower digital twins in data management (Jha et al., 2021 ; L'Hermitte & Nair, 2021 ; Masudin et al., 2021 ).   4.10 Target 11.c: financial and technical assistance for least-developed countries to construct sustainable and resilient buildings Constructing sustainable and resilient buildings is crucial for Least Developed Countries (LDCs) seeking to lessen the destructive force of natural disasters and climate change, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and improve citizens’ overall quality of life. Such countries require various forms of support from more developed countries in order to build resilient and environmentally friendly structures. Target 11.c highlights the importance of this matter by emphasizing the financial and technical assistance that should be offered by developed countries. Recent studies have indicated that BCT can significantly facilitate this process. BCT can be useful for construction projects in developing countries in several ways. First, it has the potential to offer a reliable and transparent decentralized platform for monitoring and validating the sustainability of construction processes and building materials (Mahmudnia et al., 2022 ). Second, BCT could enable stakeholders to verify compliance with sustainable practices across the entire building life cycle, including the materials sourcing, construction, and occupancy phases (Figueiredo et al., 2022 ). Third, BCT could be used to connect experts, professionals, and stakeholders worldwide, allowing them to share knowledge and collaborate on sustainable building projects (Lee et al., 2021 ; Tao et al., 2021 ). Moreover, BCT could address the issue of intellectual property that professionals may face in international projects. BCT provides a safe and transparent method for protecting and sharing intellectual property such as sustainable building designs and innovations, encouraging more experts to contribute their knowledge to LDCs (Wang et al., 2019 ; Kiu et al., 2022 ). One substantial contribution developed countries can make to LDCs in terms of constructing sustainable and resilient buildings is providing new forms of financial assistantship, which can be facilitated through BCT. A novel form of financial assistantship is tokenization. Tokenization of assets is essentially a digital form of asset securitization in which the value of the asset is recorded and divided into small tokens that can be freely purchased and sold on an exchange (Singh, 2022 ). By tokenizing sustainable building projects, stakeholders can gain a new funding source from investors eager to support environmentally friendly and socially responsible projects (Swinkels et al., 2023 ). This can then help to overcome the financial barriers that often keep LDCs from investing in sustainable building practices. Besides the benefits of tokenization, smart contracts can automate the release of funds based on predefined conditions, improving transparency and reducing the risk of misappropriation (Ahmadisheykhsarmast et al., 2020 ). This feature can be used to boost investor confidence and attract additional funding. Moreover, BCT facilitates faster and cheaper cross-border remittances, making it easier for LDCs to access international funds for sustainable building projects (Naderi, 2021 ).   5 Challenges and possible obstacles This section examines the challenges associated with the deployment of BCT and explores under-discussed aspects of blockchain in the literature. It presents two approaches to discussing these challenges. The first analyzes the challenges in implementing blockchain for each of the SDG 11 targets. The unique issues associated with implementing BCT for each of the SDG 11 goals are listed in Table 2  . The second part discusses broader problems with BCT, including political, economic, social, technical, legal, and security issues; these are outlined in Table 3  . From the information provided in Tables 2 and 3 , it is evident that BCT is still in the early stages of making disruptive changes in the pursuit of SDG 11. Several obstacles and challenges need to be overcome for successful implementation. One significant concern is the potential misuse of BCT by powerful entities with greater access to technology and other resources. This raises the risk of such entities leveraging their influence for personal gain, thus undermining the democratic principles and equity objectives of SDG 11. Furthermore, the absence of a centralized authority in blockchain systems may create a fertile ground for increased illegal activities. Inadequate designs of blockchain protocols could also leave systems vulnerable to hacking attempts and data breaches. Delays in achieving consensus and the high cost associated with BCT implementation are additional issues that need to be addressed. These challenges highlight the complexity and multifaceted nature of utilizing BCT for SDG 11 and emphasize the need for thorough consideration and meticulous design to ensure its effectiveness.  6 Future directions It is evident that incorporating BCT to achieve SDG 11 faces several challenges. For this technology to be widely used to improve sustainable cities, it is essential to recognize that resolving current obstacles will not be enough. Recognizing and preparing for possible future issues that may arise from technological advancements is crucial. For instance, concerns regarding the security of BCT have been heightened by the rapid progress of quantum technology, and in particular the possibility of cryptographic system compromise. At particular risk are the Grover and Shor quantum algorithms, which directly target the foundational cryptographic principles upon which blockchain is built (Tamil Selvi & Thamilselvan, 2022 ). Hence, additional research is essential to developing quantum-resistant blockchain cryptography techniques. Moreover, the integration of AI into BCT has shown great potential for addressing some of the critical BCT issues such as security, consensus, scalability, and interoperability (Ressi et al., 2024 ). Moreover, it is necessary to outline a clear future research direction with the goal of advancing the utilization of BCT. Through this comprehensive review of the literature, it was determined that future research efforts to enhance BCT implementation in urban settings should be categorized into three primary areas. These areas encompass the resolution of challenges related to adoption, the improvement of technological and operational aspects, and mitigation of legal and regulatory challenges (see Fig. 7  ). To facilitate the widespread adoption and acceptance of BCT in cities, measures should be taken to enhance public education and awareness of the technology, transform negative perceptions, build trust among stakeholders, ensure user-friendly interfaces, incentivize organizations to transition from traditional systems to BCT, commercialize the technology, and provide adequate incentives for individuals (Khan et al., 2023 ; Singh et al., 2023a ; Singh et al., 2023b ; Vishnu et al., 2024 ; Wong et al., 2024 ). However, as BCT gains acceptance among a larger user base, it is crucial to address its technical and operational aspects. In this regard, ongoing issues include the need to improve data security and protection and system compatibility, as well as the lack of a proficient workforce, deficient and insufficient interoperable platforms, absence of the infrastructure required for equitable access for all, and importance of increasing storage capacity to accommodate the large body of data (Govindan et al., 2023 ; Khawaja & Javidroozi, 2023 ; Saraf et al., 2024 ; Singh et al., 2023c ). To address the technical challenges, researchers propose utilizing AI techniques. The integration of AI with BCT has shown promise in addressing some of the issues related to security, consensus, scalability, and interoperability (Ressi et al., 2024 ). Finally, the cross-border nature of BCT creates challenges for regulatory authorities in terms of jurisdiction, legal enforcement, and compliance. Some of these problems stem from differences in legal systems among countries, the need for an updated legal framework, challenges associated with the interpretation of smart contracts, and a lack of certainty about the responsible party in times of contract or consensus failure (Agapiou, 2023 ; Bahrepour & Maleki, 2024 ; Ferreira, 2021 ; Prewett et al., 2020 ).  7 Limitations The scope of this systematic review was limited to peer-reviewed journal articles; book chapters and conference papers were not included. It is important to recognize that conference papers and book chapters can offer useful knowledge and innovative insights into the implications of BCT in cities. Therefore, future studies should examine these types of sources.  8 Conclusion This review provides a comprehensive analysis of BCT within the context of sustainable development. It explores the benefits and applications of BCT across all SDG 11 targets, aligning with the criteria set by the United Nations. In addition, disruptive technologies often have unexplored aspects and inherent risks, which could complicate implementation or jeopardize outcomes. Therefore, this research also highlights these facets and potential challenges. By investigating the benefits of BCT for each of the 10 SDG 11 targets, this study highlights the potential BCT has to promote sustainability in housing, transportation, public participation, heritage preservation, disaster management, air quality monitoring, waste management, development planning, disaster risk reduction, and sustainable construction, as well as aid in the tracking of missing and affected individuals and fatalities after disasters and provide protection against physical or sexual harassment. The benefits of BCT stem from its diverse inherent characteristics, such as decentralization, transparency, verifiability, immutability, consensus-driven operation, trustless nature, and encryption. These intrinsic characteristics enhance security and privacy in different urban domains and incentivize participation, promote democratic city planning, and mitigate the adverse effects of natural disasters on cities. Conversely, serious concerns require attention prior to implementing BCT. These concerns encompass both the challenges associated with the technology's implementation, such as social and economic barriers, and factors that could deter its widespread adoption, such as the emergence of novel crimes. These aspects span political, economic, social, technical, legal, and security dimensions. While BCT implementation has the potential to improve sustainable cities and communities, it can also introduce new problems like promulgating illegal activities, regional disparities, exacerbating implementation costs, and increasing energy consumption, as well as unfairly advantaging more developed regions. Effective regulations are urgently needed to address these concerns. Finally, this review provides future research directions and highlights the need for a balanced perspective to ensure the responsible and effective utilization of BCT to advance sustainable development efforts. Also, it is recommended that future researchers thoroughly assess the consequences of BCT on each of the 10 SDG 11 targets. Extending this approach to other SDGs would also further enable the harnessing of this technology.
