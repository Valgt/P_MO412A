                  We developed a high-resolution machine learning based surrogate model to identify a robust land-use future for Australia which meets multiple UN Sustainable Development Goals. We compared machine learning models with different architectures to pick the best performing model considering the data type, accuracy metrics, ability to handle uncertainty and computational overhead requirement. The surrogate model, called ML-LUTO Spatial, was trained on the Land-Use Trade-Offs (version 1.0) model of Australian agricultural land system sustainability. Using the surrogate model, we generated projections of land-use futures at 1.1 km resolution with 95% classification accuracy, and which far surpassed the computational benchmarks of the original model. This efficiency enabled the generation of numerous SDG-compliant (SDGs 2, 6, 7, 13, 15) future land-use maps on a standard laptop, a task previously dependent upon high-performance computing clusters. Combining these projections, we derived a single, robust land-use future and quantified the uncertainty. Our findings indicate that while agricultural land-use remains dominant in all Australian regions, extensive carbon plantings were identified in Queensland and environmental plantings played a role across the study area, reflecting a growing urgency for offsetting greenhouse gas emissions and the restoration of ecosystems to support biodiversity across Australia to meet the 2050 Sustainable Development Goals.

(2023) developed a machine learning based surrogate model for land-use sustainability assessment but the model was designed to project aggregate, national-level land-system performance against environmental and socio-economic indicators rather than detailed spatially-resolved land-use maps. Standalone machine learning models have been used to accurately predict spatial land-use change with high computational efficiency providing policymakers with ready access to rapid decision support (Cao et al., 2023; Okwuashi and Ndehedehe, 2021; Liang et al., 2021a; Gharaibeh et al., 2020; Guzman et al., 2020). Van Strien et al. (2019) used a support vector machine model to understand inner workings of an agent-based model focused on land-use change in a mountainous region in Switzerland. Nguyen et al. (2019) used artificial neural networks (ANNs) to create a surrogate of the DayCent biogeochemical model which captured 99% of the variation in the original model and produced high spatial resolution maps 6.2 million times faster. Harrison-Atlas et al. (2021) used a novel approach employing Gaussian process-based surrogate modelling, incorporating convolutional neural networks to comprehend the impact of wind power on land-use at a grid cell resolution of 2 km2. These studies demonstrate the potential for application of surrogate machine learning models for emulating sophisticated, process-based, high spatial resolution land-use change models and to produce future land-use projections to support rapid policy decision support (Helgeson et al., 2022; Shavazipour et al., 2021b; Peppes et al., 2021; Guzman et al., 2020).This work was supported by a Deakin University Postgraduate Research scholarship DUPR and the Land-Use Futures Program, a collaboration between Deakin University, Australia and ClimateWorks Centre, Australia.

We developed a high-resolution machine learning based surrogate model to identify a robust land-use future for Australia which meets multiple UN Sustainable Development Goals. We compared machine learning models with different architectures to pick the best performing model considering the data type, accuracy metrics, ability to handle uncertainty and computational overhead requirement. The surrogate model, called ML-LUTO Spatial , was trained on the Land-Use Trade-Offs (version 1.0) model of Australian agricultural land system sustainability. Using the surrogate model, we generated projections of land-use futures at 1.1 km resolution with 95% classification accuracy, and which far surpassed the computational benchmarks of the original model. This efficiency enabled the generation of numerous SDG-compliant (SDGs 2, 6, 7, 13, 15) future land-use maps on a standard laptop, a task previously dependent upon high-performance computing clusters. Combining these projections, we derived a single, robust land-use future and quantified the uncertainty. Our findings indicate that while agricultural land-use remains dominant in all Australian regions, extensive carbon plantings were identified in Queensland and environmental plantings played a role across the study area, reflecting a growing urgency for offsetting greenhouse gas emissions and the restoration of ecosystems to support biodiversity across Australia to meet the 2050 Sustainable Development Goals.   Keywords Machine learning  Surrogate modelling  Sustainable development goals  Robustness  Land-use futures   Data availability I have provided the data and code repository links (https://zenodo.org/records/8374754 ).   1 Introduction A sustainable land sector is key to achieving several UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) including Goal 15 (Life on Land), Goal 2 (Zero Hunger), Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), and Goal 13 (Climate Action) (UN, 2015 ). Sustainable land use and management that considers trade-offs and synergies between different goals is an essential component in balancing the competing demands between human activities (e.g., food production) and environmental sustainability (e.g., storing carbon, supporting biodiversity) (IPCC, 2022 ). However, future socioeconomic and environmental uncertainties, such as climate change, population growth, policy change, and market volatility propagate uncertainty in future land-use projections and their sustainability (Liang et al., 2021b ; Molotoks et al., 2021 ; Bryan et al., 2015b ). To identify land-use futures that meet sustainability goals in ways that are robust to this uncertainty requires evaluating many land-use change scenarios using process-based computational simulation (Harmsen et al., 2021 ). Process-based simulation models have been developed and applied for assessing and projecting sustainable land-use futures at highly resolved spatial scales (Cao et al., 2023 ; Okwuashi and Ndehedehe, 2021 ; Liu et al., 2021 ; Liang et al., 2021a ; Bryan et al., 2016 ; Meiyappan et al., 2014 ; Wise et al., 2014 ; Van Asselen and Verburg, 2013 ; Souty et al., 2012 ; Schaldach et al., 2011 ). However, land system dynamics are complex and working with spatial data is computationally demanding. As a result, process-based land-use models often lack the computational efficiency to produce and evaluate many land-use scenarios at a high resolution, crucial for enabling the effective exploration of uncertainty (Khan et al., 2023 ; Moallemi et al., 2022b ; Graham MacLean et al., 2021 ; Hadjimichael et al., 2020 ). For example, Graham Maclean et al. (2021)  used Dinamica-EGO to produced five scenario simulations at 30 m resolution to assess forest carbon trajectories in the USA. Wang et al. (2022)  used the PLUS model to explore different combinations of Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), evaluating carbon storage in the land sector at 30 m resolution. Bryan et al. (2016)  managed to explore a wide range of potential scenarios (648 in total) to investigate alternative agricultural land-use futures in Australia using the Land-Use Trade-Offs (LUTO) model at a spatial resolution of 1.1 km. However, this required a high-performance computer cluster, highly specialised mathematical programming (Nazari et al., 2015 ), and long processing times which limits the flexibility and accessibility of the model. Running only a few scenarios provides for an incomplete and sporadic exploration of the uncertainty space (Zerriffi et al., 2023 ; Shavazipour et al., 2021a ; Hurtt et al., 2011 ). Recognising the need to understand the role of uncertainty has led to increasing demand for models with lower complexity and faster run times that can run many scenarios (Angione et al., 2022 ; Pinto et al., 2021 ; Chen et al., 2021 ). This helps improve management decisions and identify more robust, spatially-explicit pathways to achieving the SDGs under the diversity of plausible futures (Moallemi et al., 2022a ; Gao and Bryan, 2017 ). In recent years, machine learning has been used to create surrogate models to approximate complex process-based models (Angione et al., 2022 ; Zhu et al., 2022 ; Razavi et al., 2021 ; Serafin et al., 2021 ; Lamperti et al., 2018 ). These surrogate models serve as valuable tools for evaluating uncertainty across a wide spectrum of socio-economic and environmental processes such as wildfire monitoring (Zhu et al., 2022 ), simulating pipeline transport (Qin et al., 2022 ), social care provision (Angione et al., 2022 ), rainfall forecasting (Gibson et al., 2021 ), and simulating groundwater (Miro et al., 2021 ; Chen et al., 2021 ), road traffic (Edali and Yücel, 2019 ), urban drainage (Li et al., 2023 ), soil carbon (Luo et al., 2013 ), and asset prices (Lamperti et al., 2018 ). However, there is a scarcity of studies dedicated to the development of surrogate models that focus on the evaluation of the spatial dimensions of land-use sustainability (Angione et al., 2022 ; Lu and Ricciuto, 2019 ). Khan et al. (2023)  developed a machine learning based surrogate model for land-use sustainability assessment but the model was designed to project aggregate, national-level land-system performance against environmental and socio-economic indicators rather than detailed spatially-resolved land-use maps. Standalone machine learning models have been used to accurately predict spatial land-use change with high computational efficiency providing policymakers with ready access to rapid decision support (Cao et al., 2023 ; Okwuashi and Ndehedehe, 2021 ; Liang et al., 2021a ; Gharaibeh et al., 2020 ; Guzman et al., 2020 ). Van Strien et al. (2019)  used a support vector machine model to understand inner workings of an agent-based model focused on land-use change in a mountainous region in Switzerland. Nguyen et al. (2019)  used artificial neural networks (ANNs) to create a surrogate of the DayCent biogeochemical model which captured 99% of the variation in the original model and produced high spatial resolution maps 6.2 million times faster. Harrison-Atlas et al. (2021)  used a novel approach employing Gaussian  process-based surrogate modelling, incorporating convolutional neural networks to comprehend the impact of wind power on land-use at a grid cell resolution of 2 km2 . These studies demonstrate the potential for application of surrogate machine learning models for emulating sophisticated, process-based, high spatial resolution land-use change models and to produce future land-use projections to support rapid policy decision support (Helgeson et al., 2022 ; Shavazipour et al., 2021b ; Peppes et al., 2021 ; Guzman et al., 2020 ). In this study, we built a surrogate model of the Land-Use Trade-Offs model—a complex, integrated, spatial land-use model—to run many scenarios, producing high resolution land-use maps of Australia which meet national-level SDG targets (SDGs 2, 6, 7, 13, 15). We trained the surrogate model called ML-LUTO Spatial , with a dataset across multiple global outlooks, productivity growth, biodiversity fund scenarios, adoption hurdle rates, and different climate model outputs (Gao and Bryan, 2017 ). We applied the scenario settings required to meet aggregate sustainability goals for the Australian land system by the year 2050 found using the ML-LUTO model (Khan et al. (2023)  using scenario discovery. We produced high spatial resolution land-use projections for those scenarios and combined them to create a robust, SDG-compliant (SDGs 2, 6, 7, 13, 15) land-use future for Australia. We then quantified the uncertainty and robustness of this land-use future at high spatial resolution. This research contributes to sustainable land-use planning and decision-making, giving policymakers a tool to quickly run and analyze the impacts of policy decisions on land-use, while safeguarding environmental integrity and human well-being.  2 Methods The overall methodological approach for this research is outlined in Fig. 1  . The study involves the collection and processing of data for surrogate model training. A comprehensive dataset was created by assembling scenario settings, as well as raster format LUTO input data and output land-use maps at 1.1 km grid cell resolution from the LUTO model data repository (Bryan et al., 2015b ). Multiple machine learning architectures were then trained and tested on the dataset and their performance and accuracy were evaluated. The most accurate machine learning algorithm was used to generate SDG-compliant land-use maps which were then combined to find a robust land-use future which meets multiple SDG targets. 2.1 The Land-Use Trade-Offs (LUTO) model LUTO, an integrated land systems model tailored to Australia's intensive agricultural land, operates at a spatial resolution of 1.1 km, covering 812,383 grid cells. It encompasses multiple interacting components, including land-use dynamics, agricultural productivity, climate change, water resources, bioenergy considerations, and biodiversity values. The model projects potential future changes in spatial land-use patterns in response to a diverse array of scenario and policy settings (Gao et al., 2016 ). These settings take into account multiple social, ecological, climatic, economic, policy, and behavioural variables, collectively shaping the economic prospects of agriculture and a variety of alternative land-use options, and how landholders might respond to these changing incentives. The LUTO model has been subject to a comprehensive global sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis (Connor et al., 2015 ) using the extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (eFAST). Key determinants of land use change and it's impacts included carbon price, agricultural commodity prices, agricultural productivity, and landholder adoption behaviour. To explore different possible land-use and sustainability outcomes for Australia, Bryan et al. (2016)  configured scenario settings across several uncertainty dimensions (Table 1  ), resulting in 648 unique land-use future scenarios. Each of these scenarios represents a unique combination of parameter settings aimed at capturing a spectrum of sustainability outcomes within the context of plausible global, national, socio-economic, and environmental trajectories (Gao and Bryan, 2017 ; Bryan et al., 2015a , 2015c ; Connor et al., 2015 ). These dimensions play a pivotal role in influencing land-use changes within LUTO, primarily through their effects on the relative profitability of various land-use categories. These categories encompass Agricultural Production and emerging land-use alternatives such as Carbon Plantings, Environmental Plantings, Wheat (Biofuels), Wheat (Food/Biofuels), Wheat (Food/Bioenergy), and Woody Perennials (Bioenergy). For each scenario, the model generates annual time series data from 2013 to 2050, resulting in 38 years of spatial land-use projections. In total, the dataset contains 24,624 (648 scenarios × 38 years) individual land-use projections, providing insights into potential future land-use patterns under different global and domestic settings.  2.2 Machine learning based surrogate modelling 2.2.1 Data preparation In the initial data preparation stage, we compiled a comprehensive dataset incorporating various input scenario settings outlined in Table 1 , along with corresponding spatial socioeconomic and climatic data layers. Inputs served as variables, while outputs from each scenario and year generated by the LUTO model were recorded as shown in Table 2  . Data was structured in tabular format, with inputs and outputs for each scenario and year in the same row. Categorical variables were transformed into dummy variables (1 for presence, 0 for absence). All 61 input and output variables were linearly transformed to fall within the [0, 1] range. Redundant or uninformative elements were removed following feature selection principles in machine learning. This resulted in a dataset of 53 variables per scenario, along with 8 outputs. The dataset contained 61 columns and 812,383 rows per scenario for each of the 24,624 LUTO scenarios (648 scenarios × 38 years). Individual scenario datasets were combined into one, totalling 2,001,512,592 rows (648 scenarios × 38 years × 812,383 grid cells). A subset of input variables is described in Table 2  (further details in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 ).  2.2.2 Machine learning model selection and tuning ANNs are known to perform well in capturing non-linear processes such as land-use change but their performance can vary significantly between model architectures (Angione et al., 2022 ; Gharaibeh et al., 2020 ; Yuan et al., 2009 ). We evaluated seven ANN architectures selected considering the data size, structure, and computational requirements of the modelling task. These included Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) (Murtagh, 1991 ), General Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) (Macukow, 2016 ), 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) (LeCun et al., 1989 ), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) (Dey and Salem, 2017 ) models. These models offer diverse capabilities which can meet the challenges presented by land-use modelling tasks (Angione et al., 2022 ; Wang et al., 2022 ; Geer, 2021 ; Guzman et al., 2020 ; Zhai et al., 2020 ). We tested both a standard MLP architecture and MLP with batch normalisation (MLP-Batch) architecture which can accelerate training by normalizing activation in each layer, reducing covariate shifts, and making training more stable. We evaluated both standard FNN architecture and FNN with dropout, a regularization technique that prevents overfitting by dropping a fraction of neurons during training. Considering the multidimensionality of the data, we evaluated a 1D-CNN architecture which excels at capturing dependencies within a single dimension. RNN, designed to process sequential data, was also evaluated due to its ability to analyze spatial and temporal dynamics simultaneously. Finally, we tested the GRU model architecture as GRUs can handle issues associated with traditional RNNs (e.g., vanishing gradient problem) and are known to be able to preserve information over longer sequences thereby increasing their effectiveness in capturing dynamic non-linear relationships. Each machine learning model comes with uncertainties due to several hyperparameters  including the number of layers, number of neurons/cells, learning rates, activation functions, and regularization methods which varies based on the input data dimensions and data type. Models are sensitive to these hyperparameter settings and fine-tuning is required based on the data characteristics, desired outcomes, and computational constraints. To optimize the hyperparameters, we first created five training/test dataset replicates, randomly splitting the LUTO model dataset at a ratio of 4:1, ensuring representation of each land-use class in the training (1,601,210,073 rows) datasets and test (400,302,518 rows) datasets. For each of the five training/test dataset replicates, we optimized the hyperparameters for each of the seven machine learning models using 50 iterations of both the random search and grid search methods in Python Scikit-Learn (Table S3 ). These techniques are established methods for enhancing performance and selecting the best hyperparameter configuration considering the data dimensions, data types, and desired performance (Zhang et al., 2021 ). The best set of hyperparameters were chosen for each model by evaluating performance metrics and outcomes. This approach helped in determining the most effective structure for each model and maximised predictive skill. As the dataset was too large for models to handle all at once, the machine learning models were designed to train incrementally and ingested only 812,383 rows per iteration (each scenario contains 812,383 rows of data and there are 24,624 scenarios). After hyperparameter tuning, the machine learning models were trained and tested on the five random training-test datasets using five-fold cross validation and performance evaluation metrics were averaged across the five folds for each iteration.  2.2.3 Model-level evaluation metrics The performance and accuracy of each model was evaluated using a range of metrics and a comparative analysis was conducted to identify the model offering the best trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy of representation of land-use dynamics. We employed a range of evaluation metrics (Table 3  ) (Calderón-Loor et al., 2021 ; Zhai et al., 2020 ) to quantify the deviation between the observed values from the LUTO projections and the predicted values from the surrogate models. User's accuracy (also known as Precision) and Producer's accuracy (also known as Recall or Sensitivity) were used to evaluate the performance of the surrogate models in correctly classifying samples within specific classes. Precision measures the proportion of correctly classified samples in a particular class relative to the total number of samples that the classifier predicted to belong to that class, while Recall measures the proportion of correctly classified samples in a particular class relative to the total number of samples that truly belong to that class. F1-score was also assessed to provide a balanced evaluation of model accuracy, considering both true positives and false positives (Rwanga and Ndambuki, 2017 ). To further evaluate the accuracy of projecting changes in land-use, we employed the Figure of Merit (Pontius et al., 2007 ) which combines the Precision and Recall to measure the overall accuracy of the model in projecting both the occurrence and the specific land-use types (Pontius et al., 2007 ). It considers the total number of observed changed cells that are correctly projected as changed cells and the number of observed unchanged cells that are erroneously projected to be changed. Furthermore, we calculated Specificity, Prevalence, and Accuracy. Specificity helps to understand how well the surrogate models accurately identify areas that have not undergone land-use change and the composition and distribution of land-use classes within the dataset under examination. It quantifies the overall frequency or prevalence of each land-use class within the dataset as contextual information for model evaluation. Finally, Accuracy provides an overall assessment of the model's correctness in classifying land-use change. It calculates the ratio of correctly classified instances (the sum of True Positives and True Negatives) to the total number of instances in the dataset. These metrics all offer complementary insights into model performance necessary to support an evaluation of accuracy and suitability for land-use change modelling using machine learning based surrogate models.  2.2.4 Model implementation and scenario analysis The best performing model (which we called ML-LUTO Spatial ) was then used to run many simulations (termed pathways ) of Australian land-use futures. We produced land-use maps for scenarios which have been identified as meeting national SDG targets (weak ambition target achievement levels for 2050) (Table 4  ) (Khan et al., 2023 ). In our previous study (Khan et al., 2023 ), we identified the safe operating space characterised as input parameter ranges within which more than 80% of scenarios achieved the 5 SDG targets (i.e., >80% purity) (Table 5  ). We selected the 252 pathways which occurred within this safe operating space and which met the 5 targets. We used the same global and domestic settings (Table 5 ) and implemented the spatial data settings for those 252 scenarios (Table 2 ) in running the machine learning based surrogate version of LUTO (ML-LUTO Spatial ) to produce 252 land-use projections, each of which represent a distinct spatial distribution of land-use across Australia which achieve multiple SDGs at the national level (Khan et al., 2023 ).  2.2.5 Establishing a robust land-use future for achieving the SDGs Each of the 252 individual land-use map projections depicts a spatial arrangement of land use which achieves multiple SDGs. We combined these to present a single robust, SDG-compliant land-use future and calculated a range of metrics which quantify its robustness at the grid cell level. To do this, we first calculated the frequency of occurrence of each land-use class for each grid cell via spatial overlay (i.e., overlaying land-use maps on top of each other). We used this to create a robust, SDG-compliant land-use future as the most frequent land-use occurring in each cell under the 252 individual SDG-compliant land-use projections. We then calculated the relative frequency with which the most common land-use class occurred (in percentage terms) for each cell, which can be thought of as how essential it is for each land-use to occur in each cell to achieve the SDGs. We also quantified the Margin of Victory of each cell based on the difference between the frequency of occurrence of the most frequent land-use class minus that of the second most frequent land-use class occurring in the 252 scenarios. This metric reflects the degree of dominance of the most frequent land-use class in comparison to the second most frequent land-use class for each grid cell. This concept helps to quantify the degree of distinction between the two most frequent classes within the spatial distribution of land use (McIver and Friedl, 2001 ). Further, we employed Shannon's entropy (Shannon, 1948 ) to reflect the level of uncertainty, diversity, randomness, and disorder within the land-use classification frequency for each cell amongst the 252 scenarios. Finally, we summarised the land-use changes projected for each state and territory under the robust land-use future.    3 Results 3.1 Model performance comparison Of the seven machine learning models, MLP-Batch outperformed the others across several key metrics. It achieved the highest accuracy at 0.95, and exhibited strong precision, recall, and F1-Score values, all above 0.87 (Table 6  ). Hence, not only did it classify data points accurately (high precision), but it also correctly identified a large portion of actual land-use classes (high recall). The F1-Score, which balances precision and recall, also indicates a high level of classification performance. The standard MLP model performed worse than MLP-Batch model, with an accuracy of 0.88, but with similar precision, recall, and F1-Score values. RNN, FNN, FNN With Dropout, and CNN models also showed reasonable performance, with accuracy ranging from 0.84 to 0.88 (Table 6 ). While they are competitive, they did not surpass MLP-Batch's accuracy, computational efficiency, and overall performance which made it the best choice of machine learning architecture for ML-LUTO Spatial .  3.2 Land-use classification accuracy The confusion matrix (Fig. 2  ) further reveals that the MLP-Batch model was able to predict Agriculture (>400,000 cells) with 90% accuracy. However, about 4.5% of the Agriculture cells were incorrectly classified as Carbon Plantings, 3.1% as Environmental Plantings, and 2.2% as Wheat (Food, Biofuels). The model was able to correctly classify Carbon Plantings (>163,000 cells) 87.8% of the time, but 8.3% of Carbon Plantings cells were incorrectly classified as Agriculture and 3.2% as Environmental Plantings. Similarly for Environmental Plantings (>43,000 cells), 13.2% of cells were incorrectly classified as Agriculture. For Wheat (Biofuels) (>56,000 cells), 18.1% of cells were incorrectly classified as Wheat (Food, Biofuels) and 15.2% as Agriculture. Finally, for Wheat (Food, Biofuels) (>80,000 cells), the model was able to predict the correct land-use class 88.2% of the time. However, the model struggled to predict other land-use classes with a very low number of samples such as Wheat (Food, Bioenergy), Woody Perennials (Biofuels), and Woody Perennials (Bioenergy) correctly. To further understand surrogate model performance, the accuracy metrics (Table 7  ) highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of the model in classifying individual land-use classes. Accuracy metrics revealed varying levels of performance for different land-use classes. The model exhibits a high True Positive rate, demonstrating its proficiency in correctly identifying land-use classes such as Agriculture, Carbon Plantings and Wheat (Food, Biofuels). This is further supported by a Precision of 0.92, 0.86, and 0.77 for Agriculture, Carbon Plantings, and Wheat (Food, Biofuels), respectively. The Recall values (0.90, 0.88, and 0.88) demonstrate ML-LUTO Spatial's  ability to minimize false positives, contributing to its high overall Accuracy scores (0.91, 0.95, and 0.96). The F1-Scores (0.91, 0.87, and 0.82) reflect a balance between precision and recall, affirming the model's robustness in classifying these land-use categories. Furthermore, for Agriculture, Carbon Plantings, and Wheat (Food, Biofuels) the Figure of Merit values are relatively high at 0.83, 0.75, and 0.68. These values indicate that the model achieves a good balance between precision and recall in classifying land-use categories and minimizes false positives and false negatives. However, ML-LUTO Spatial  was not as skilful in predicting Environmental Plantings and Wheat (Biofuels). Although a high Recall score of 0.84 indicated that when the model classified an area as Environmental Plantings, it tended to be accurate, the lower Precision (0.58) and Figure of Merit (0.49) indicate the challenges in accurately distinguishing Environmental Plantings from other land-use types, while other land-use classes were falsely being classified as Environmental Plantings (Table 7 ). This is also backed by the lowest Prevalence score of 0.05 indicating that the land-use class was relatively rare in the dataset comparing to the other land-use classes suggesting that the model might not have had sufficient samples to learn to predict this land-use class. For, Wheat (Biofuels), the model had high Precision (0.97) but low Recall (0.56) which resulted in a low Figure of Merit (0.54), indicating conservatism in predicting this class and tendency to miss actual instances. This can also be seen in the confusion matrix (Fig. 2 ) where 18.1% of this land-use was falsely identified as Wheat (Food, Biofuels) and 15.2% is identified as Agriculture. Wheat (Biofuels) had the second lowest prevalence score (0.07) indicating this land-use class was also rare compared to other land-use classes in the dataset.  3.3 Scenario analysis and a robust, SDG-compliant land-use future Implementing the ML-LUTO Spatial  model, we produced 252 land-use maps and generated a robust land-use map which meets the SDG targets. The robust, SDG-compliant land-use future for Australia (i.e., the map of the most frequent land-use occurrence amongst all 252 scenarios for each cell) is presented in Fig. 3   and individual maps of the frequency of occurrence of each land-use amongst the 252 scenarios are presented in Fig. 4  . Distinct patterns occurred in land-use distribution under the robust, SDG-compliant land-use future. All states maintained a significant area of Agriculture, whereas Carbon Plantings were prominent in Queensland (94,447 km2 ) and New South Wales (12,968 km2 ) and Environmental Plantings were evident in all states. Wheat (Food, Biofuels) mostly occurred in South Australia (3289 km2 ) and Western Australia (1782 km2 ) whereas a minor presence of Wheat (Biofuels) occurred in Victoria (86 km2 ) and New South Wales (46 km2 ) (Fig. 3  and Table 8  ). The findings highlight the high level of robustness of the SDG-compliant land-use future with most cells having a high frequency of occurrence, large Margin of Victory, and low entropy (Fig. 5  ). In Queensland and Tasmania, areas of Carbon Plantings and Environmental Plantings displayed slightly lower robustness. For example, the frequency of occurrence of those land-uses in those areas was lower, featuring in only 169–224 out of 252 scenarios (Fig. 5 ).   4 Discussion We have presented ML-LUTO Spatial , a machine learning based surrogate model of the detailed, process-based LUTO model which can accurately reproduce projections of future land-use change for Australia with much greater computational efficiency, and much lower resource and time overheads. We produced simulated land-use maps based on the settings and associated spatial data for 252 scenarios which are known to achieve multiple SDG targets (Khan et al., 2023 ). The ML-LUTO Spatial  model was 50 times faster than the LUTO model, taking just 3 s per land-use map projection on a standard laptop computer compared to the full LUTO model which took a week to generate 648 future Australian land-use scenarios (2.5 min per land-use projection) (Gao et al., 2016 ) and required an advanced column generation algorithm (Nazari et al., 2015 ) and parallel computing on a high-performance computer cluster (Gao and Bryan, 2016 ; Bryan, 2013 ). The model was used to produce a robust land-use future for Australia which achieves five SDG targets relevant to the land sector. This marked improvement in efficiency, underscores its potential for widespread application in land-use planning and policy development. Through simulating 252 scenarios aligned with multiple SDG targets, the model produces a robust land-use future that addresses Economic Returns, Food/Fibre Production, Biofuels Production, Emissions Abatement, and Biodiversity Services, thus supporting sustainable land-use planning practices and contributing to broader sustainability objectives at the national level. The implications of these findings are substantial, particularly in the context of land-use SDG implementation and land-use planning ensuring land system sustainability. By providing a more efficient and accurate means of projecting future land-use changes, ML-LUTO Spatial  offers policymakers and stakeholders a powerful tool for informed decision-making. The ability to rapidly simulate numerous scenarios allows for the exploration of different policy interventions and their potential impacts on land-use, facilitating the identification of strategies that optimize SDG attainment while minimizing adverse environmental and socio-economic effects. 4.1 Implications for land-use modelling and decision-support The results highlight the potential of machine learning based surrogate models for land-use modelling applications and encourages further exploration and refinement of these approaches (Angione et al., 2022 ; Lu and Ricciuto, 2019 ). The model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting Agriculture and identifying new land-uses such as Carbon Plantings and Wheat (Food, Biofuels). Despite the high overall accuracy and step-change in computation speed and accessibility, the model struggled to accurately predict Environmental Plantings and Wheat (Biofuels), highlighting a limitation in its classification abilities where the land-use class occurrence in the original dataset was less common. The performance evaluations for each of the machine learning architectures assessed provides insights into their strengths and weaknesses in land-use modelling. These insights can guide model selection for creating surrogate models for land-use, ensuring high accuracy and reliability. The machine learning based surrogate model ML-LUTO Spatial's  incremental learning ability and speed advantage enables it to be quickly trained to capture new model behaviour. It also enables the rapid projection of land-use futures based on new policy and scenario settings. This can enable policymakers to swiftly address emergent and rapidly changing needs for immediate land-use, planning for future land-use and sustainability decision insights. The surrogate models also have a high degree of accessibility compared to the original process-based LUTO model, eliminating the need for access to high performance compute capabilities and highly specialised mathematical capability and algorithmic design to enhance compute efficiency. The lightweight and fast nature of the surrogate model can contribute to more responsive and effective land management, land-use planning and policy decision support. The practicality and accessibility of ML-LUTO Spatial  can empower stakeholders at various levels to engage in evidence-based land-use planning. By providing timely and accurate projections, this tool facilitates informed decision-making to ensure land-use practices align with broader sustainability objectives. This aligns with the broader goal of advancing land-use modelling techniques to enable accurate projections, inform decision-makers, and facilitate sustainable land management and land-use planning practices in the face of rapidly changing sustainability challenges.  4.2 Implications for land system sustainability We ran ML-LUTO Spatial  to produce 252 land-use projections at high resolution for scenario settings which have been demonstrated to achieve five land-sector relevant SDGs at the national level including Economic Returns (SDG 2), Food/Fibre Production (SDG 2), Biofuels Production (SDG 7), Emissions Abatement (SDG 13), and Biodiversity Services (SDG 15) (Table 4 ) (Khan et al., 2023 ). By exploring the land-use allocations of each cell amongst the 252 scenarios, we identified the most frequent land-use per cell as a robust land-use future which achieved these SDGs and quantified the robustness of land-use allocation (Fig. 5 ). This deep exploration of robustness of the SDG-compliant land-use future was difficult with the full LUTO model due to the heavy resource requirement and computational overhead (Nazari et al., 2015 ). This high-resolution surrogate modelling approach allowed us to explore the scenario space in relation to the output land-use distribution at the grid cell level. Exploring the robust land-use future depicting the most frequent land-use of Australia for meeting the SDGs, showed that while Agriculture remained dominant in all states, there were notable changes in other land-use categories. The presence of wheat cultivation for biofuels in South Australia and Western Australia indicates a shift towards renewable mobile transport fuel production. To meet the target of ≥85.8 PJ per year (Table 4 ), investments in biofuel production and processing technologies will be important in those states. Moreover, while there were significant areas of Carbon Plantings, Environmental Plantings, and Wheat (Biofuels), indicating a commitment to SDG 13 (Table 4 ) Climate Action, the challenge lies in meeting the target of ≥160.9 Mt CO2 e in emissions abatement per year. Achieving this level of emissions reduction will necessitate strong incentives and regulatory policies promoting land-use change, carbon sequestration, afforestation, and transitioning to cleaner energy sources. These efforts directly align with the 2050 net-zero target and the Paris Agreement, especially Goal 13 (Climate Action), and intersect with other SDGs like Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and Goal 15 (Life on Land). However, concerns persist about the social acceptance of large-scale plantations, particularly monocultures, and the sustainability of offsets as a climate strategy. To enable a sustainable future for Australia's land sector, it is also imperative to emphasize research and development aimed at enhancing agricultural productivity. Simultaneously, there is a need to carefully manage the pace of land-use change through the implementation of regulatory measures and incentive policies. Allocating resources for carbon sequestration within land systems and promoting innovation in biofuels generation are crucial components of this endeavour. Additionally, the effective implementation of the biodiversity levy policy is essential, ensuring that a portion of the proceeds from Carbon Plantings contributes to the restoration of Australia's native ecosystems. As the robust, SDG-compliant land-use future is directly linked to a safe operating space defined by specific policy settings, this allows policy makers to make rapid assessments and understand the policy requirements and implications on land-use of policy interventions (Helgeson et al., 2022 ; Shavazipour et al., 2021b ; Peppes et al., 2021 ; Guzman et al., 2020 ). However, we note that the robust, land-use future emergent from this analysis is entirely dependent upon the original LUTO model structure, parameter settings, and choice of SDG targets. Hence, we suggest that these methods and results form the basis of further modelling, discussion, and analysis about a shared ambitions for a sustainable future land system for Australia.  4.3 Study limitations and future directions High resolution, process-based land-use models are typically complex, computationally demanding, and data heavy. Developing a surrogate model requires extensive consultation with the developers of the original process-based model and subject matter experts to understand model structure, code, and data; underlying socio-economic, agronomic, and environmental processes; and specific variables and their importance. In this study, we compared seven machine learning models for land-use projection and several models demonstrated promising performance. It is important to note that the choice of models is likely to vary depending on the specific process-based model structure, dataset, features, and parameters used. Future studies should explore a similarly wide range of machine learning models and methodologies as a form of sensitivity analysis to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of their applicability and effectiveness for the problem at hand. Furthermore, machine learning models are reliant on data and learn the patterns and behaviours of the given dataset and take on the uncertainties inherent in the dataset. Hence, machine learning based surrogate models are most useful for densifying the number of projections within the existing scenario space. Their capacity to make projections based on input parameter values that are outside of their range of experience needs to be tested in more detail. The methods developed in this study also pave the way for similar approaches to develop surrogate land-use models for other countries or at global scales. Future work could involve applying these techniques to create surrogates of other established land-use models like MAgPIE or GLOBIOM.   5 Conclusion We developed a surrogate model called ML-LUTO Spatial  which closely approximated the behaviour of the complex, non-linear, high spatial resolution, LUTO national land-system sustainability model for Australia. This surrogate model enabled us to produce hundreds of scenario outputs in a short amount of time, allowing for the exploration of uncertainties and the identification of a single spatial land-use future at high resolution for meeting multiple sustainability targets that was robust to these uncertainties. The findings of this study have significant implications for Australia's land system and its ability to achieve the SDGs. The development of a robust, SDG-compliant land-use future revealed important patterns for land-use across Australia's agricultural land which are necessary if land-sector relevant SDGs (i.e., SDGs 2, 6, 7, 13, and 15) are to be achieved. Agricultural land-use remains dominant but significant areas of land (particularly in Queensland) were allocated to Carbon Plantings and Environmental Plantings were found to be important over the entire study area. The analysis of land-use classification accuracy metrics revealed that even though the model accurately classified Agricultural land-use, it faced challenges in projecting different types of Wheat classes [Wheat (Food, Biofuels) and Wheat (Food Bioenergy)] (Fig. 2 ) and identifying Environmental Plantings which occurred less frequently in the training dataset. The findings also emphasize the importance of tailoring land-use policies to regional contexts and priorities, considering the unique land-use patterns required to achieve the SDGs in Australia's land system. The methods and results can contribute to further modelling, analysis, and discussion around directions for a sustainable future land system for Australia.
