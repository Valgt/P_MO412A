Keywords Cleaner production  Environmental and economic assessment  Sustainable development goals  Textile industry    1 Introduction Cleaner Production – CP conceptually leads to integration of the continuous application of preventive environmental strategies to processes, products and services aiming to increase the efficiency and to minimize the risks to people and the environment (Alkaya and Demirer, 2014a ). The adoption of CP practices collaborates to the preservation of raw materials and power, assures reduction or elimination of toxic materials and minimize the quantity of and the toxicity of the emissions and the residues during the production processes, and the textile, clothing and leather industries are priority for this CP implementation (Ghazinoory, 2005 ). The textile industry is responsible for the use of big volumes of water (Chen et al., 2017 ), as well as the disposal of toxic metals in the soil, the air and the water (San et al., 2018 ). Thus, one of the main concerns are to achieve sustainability in textile chain (Amindoust and Saghafinia, 2016 ). Thus, the adoption of CP mainly for the textile sector is a mitigator of the environmental impacts (Zhang et al., 2013 ), obtaining environmental quality results (Ibrahim et al., 2015 ). In Brazil, the textile industry is very important and directly employs 1.5 million workers in its production chain with more than 8 million indirect jobs. Its revenues are U$ 51.58 billion a year for an average textile production of 1.3 million tons and 8.9 billion garment pieces (ABIT, 2017 ). Worldwide, it is the second largest denim manufacturer, the third in the production of knitwear and the fifth largest industrial park, as well as a reference in beachwear, jeanswear and homewear (ABIT, 2017 ). The purpose of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), created in 1972 is to coordinate the international actions for protection of the environment and promotion of sustainable development. In 1992, during the ECO/92 conference, sustainable development was defined as expansion that meets the current needs without impairing the potentials of the future generations. Currently, UNEP works with a big number of partners, including other UN entities, international organizations and NGOs. At the last conference, the goals of the CP programs were defined, designed to promote global awareness for implementation of environmental protection strategies and encourage their adoption by the industries with the help of the government (UNEP, 2015 ). Furthermore, 2030 Agenda was elaborated, where the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) were listed with their 169 targets, which aim to balance the economic, social and ecological dimensions of the sustainable development, including fighting against poverty and sustainable development in the same agenda for the first time (UNEP, 2015 ). In 2018, in Colombia, the 7th International Workshop on Advances in Cleaner Production (IWACP) was held, aiming to promote a discussion concentrating on the role of CP to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. CP is propagated as an approach to identify preventive measures to reduce residues and emissions from the industrial activities (Fresner et al., 2010 ; Long et al., 2014 ), applied in the textile industry by means of replacement of certain synthetic substances with natural materials (Zhang et al., 2016a ), especially those which are industrial byproducts (Pesitsak et al., 2018 ). Organic natural materials can also be used, such as bamboo fibers (Thompson and Tong, 2016 ; Nayak and Mishra, 2016 ); natural dyes to provide more ecological processes in dyeing and finishing of fabrics (El-Gohary et al., 2013 ; Benli and Bahtiyari, 2015 ; Li et al., 2018 ); or even replacement of toxic chemical products by less polluting ones (Ibrahim et al., 2015 ; Morali et al., 2016 ; Chen and Long, 2018 ; Gong et al., 2018 ). Furthermore, the adoption of CP in the textile industry is not limited to the development of new alternative materials, but there is space for technical improvement as well (Schramm, 1998 ; Ghazinoory, 2005 ; Tong et al., 2012 ; Chen et al., 2017 ); innovation of cluster process management (Narayanaswamy and Scott, 2001 ); investment in acquisition of new equipment (El-Gohary et al., 2013 ) with payback estimated in months (Kiran-Ciliz, 2003 ; Al-Yousfi, 2004 ; Ozturk et al., 2014 , 2015 , 2016a , 2016b ; Alkaya and Deminer, 2014b ; Ozturk and Cinperi, 2018 ) and the adoption of life cycle assessment (LCA) (Yuan et al., 2013 ; Baydar et al., 2015 ). The implementation of CP can also be enforced by means of improvements in manufacturing processes, which enable the use of residual heat generated, increasing the energetic efficiency with the purpose to reduce energy consumption (Rakib, 2017 ). Also, CP can be achieved by the reduction of sodium chloride (NaCl) in the residual waters (Xiao et al. (2017 ; Alkaya and Deminer, 2014b ; Silva et al., 2018 ) and the minimization of greenhouse effect gases (Al-Yousfi, 2004 ; Dumitrescu et al., 2008 ; Ali et al., 2016 ). It is even possible to focus on the reduction of the volume of water to be disposed (Baban et al., 2010 ; Maryan and Montazer, 2013 ; Zhang et al., 2016b ; Yukseler et al., 2017 ), aiming to reduce water consumption and disposal of water to the environment (Fresner, 1998 ; Liang et al., 2018 ; Bhuiyan et al., 2018 ; Hossain et al., 2018 ); There is also a need of actions by the stakeholders involved, as representatives of the government, the industry decision-makers (Schaltegger et al., 2012 ), the NGO, consultants (Taylor, 2006 ; Manring and Moore, 2006 ), and the universities themselves (Petek and Glavic, 2000 ), in the development of public policies (Zhang et al., 2013 ) of financial incentives and regulations of limits for pollutant emissions in the waters, the air or solids according to the technical standards, for example ISO14040 (Yuan et al., 2013 ) and ISO 14000 (Ortolano et al., 2014 ). It shall be pointed out that no researches have been identified to apply the return on investment (ROI) and the discounted payback period as tools for the economic quantitative evaluations. Furthermore, the environmental assessments were limited to analyses of mass balances and percentages, which do not enable assessing the real reduction of the environmental as, for instance, Mass Intensity Factor (MIF) (Ritthoof et al., 2002 ). Another remark was that only one study was focused on the adoption of CP in the Brazilian textile industry (Silva et al., 2018 ). Furthermore, considering the big demand for environmental solutions, innovations and new technologies to approach and minimize the negative environmental impacts currently generated by the industrial production processes, no studies were found to be directly aligned to SDGs, which corroborates the conclusions by Alkaya and Demirer (2014a)  that sustainable production approach was not adapted for most industries. Based on these gaps, the following question for research is suggested: Does obtaining economic and environmental advantages from adoption of CP in the textile industry contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals? To answer this question, the purpose of this research was evaluating the economic and environmental advantages from the adoption of CP in the textile industry, in order to check whether they contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals. This was carried out by means of extensive review of the literature, complemented by elaboration of a framework confirmed through the development of two case studies, whose results enabled validating the developed theoretical aspects. This article is divided in 6 sessions, introduction, systematic literature review, methods, results, discussions, and finally, conclusions.  2 Systematic review of the literature The researches that carried out economic and environmental evaluation of the adoption of CP in the textile industries (Table 1  ) indicated reduction of the water and electric power consumption; minimization of the volumes of residual waters and gas emissions, as well as replacement by less toxic or more biodegradable products in the production processes by means of new processes or technological innovation. Furthermore, it was found out that in most researches, the quantitative evaluations were carried out by means of mass balances, power or percentage balance to indicate the resulting economic or environmental gains and the calculation of the payback in relation to the investments for acquisition of new equipment. It can also be noted that the environmental advantages from the adoption of CP in the textile sector are concentrated and indirectly related to 3 out of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of 2030 Agenda (UNEP, 2018 ) only: the first refers to Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (goal 9); the second refers to Responsible Production and Consumption (goal 12)) and finally, protection of Life on Land (goal 15). Turkey is the country with the highest number of studies related to the implementation Cleaner Production practices (CP) in the textile industry. Kiran-Ciliz (2003)  identified series of CP options related to preservation of water and power through the installation of a water heat exchanger with payback oft 1 year through economic benefits of U$ 32,370.00 a year. This was generated through the reduction of the water consumption in the dyeing processes. Baban et al. (2010)  carried out a study, in which the adoption of CP in the wool and textile mixing processes enabled reusing 75% of the residual waters. Ozturk et al. (2014) , dealt with CP techniques for the water and the chemical products used in the dyeing process, obtaining reduction in water consumption (35–67%); chemical products (25–51%); the load of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) between 44 and 58% and payback between 4 and 36 months. Furthermore, Alkaya and Demirer (2014a)  carried out a survey to assess and develop recommendations on sustainable production in the textile sector and concluded that is not adopted in most industries. Thus, it identifies a high potential in terms of economic and environmental performance to be implemented. In another research, Alkaya and Demirer (2014b)  showed that the adoption of the proposed measures for sustainable production, with investment payback of 1.5 months, promoted 40.2% reduction in the consumption of water, decrease in the consumption of electric power by 17.1%, reduction in the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) by 13.5%, and reduced the volume of NaCl by 46.0%. In 2015, Benli and Bahtiyari focused on the applicability of ozone, ultrasound and natural dyes to be introduced in a more ecological process for dyeing and finishing of cotton fabrics. Furthermore, Ozturk et al. (2015)  assessed CP in a textile industry using wool and acrylic fiber, and they found out by means of mass balance, application of Best Available Techniques (BAT) and good management practices they obtained an investment payback of 4 years. Also in 2015, Baydar et al. approached LCA for ecological T-shirts manufactured of organically cultivated cotton and as a result they obtained significant reduction in the disposal of chemical products and residual waters. In the study by Ozturk et al. (2016a) , they assessed a textile industry in the dyeing and finishing operations. The analysis of the safety data sheets of products enabled identification of 74 chemical products, which could be replaced by less toxic or more biodegradable ones. Furthermore, Ozturk et al. (2016b)  assessed CP based on the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control and Industrial Emission Directive in a cotton/polyester. Implementation of BAT and reduction of water, energy, chemical and emissions/wastes reductions, resulted in economic benefits, technical and improved environmental performance. Also in 2016, Morali et al. investigated the influence of ozonation in pre and post treatment of denim, its effect on the reuse of caustic products and the residual waters from the dyeing and finishing processes. In 2017, Yukseler et al. found out that the residual waters in the dyeing and finishing processes were responsible for up to 80% of the total generation of effluents and higher environmental impact due to the high loads of COD and upon adoption of BAT in these processes, it was possible to obtain 30% reduction in the water consumption. In a more recent research, Ozturk and Cinperi (2018)  identified and assessed 82 techniques for minimization of the water consumption and the volume of residual waters in the cotton textile finishing process, using the multi-criteria decision-making methods. Another country, where there are many researches on CP in the textile sector is China. Tong et al. (2012)  found out that the CP indicator system is a powerful tool to measure the level of textile printing production. To support the analysis of the production technology in textile printing and dyeing industries, they used the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Zhang et al. (2013)  approached the existing relation between the Chinese international trade activities s and their local environmental challenges opposed to the global ones and found out that the development of public policies, as well as the implementation of CP in the textile sector is crucial for mitigation of the environmental impacts. Also in 2013, Yuan et al. carried out LCA, which included the dyeing process according to ISO 14040 and concluded that it shall be focused on the impact generated by the water system in the textile processes. Long et al. (2014)  analyzed the project and the construction of a new pilot plant for dyeing of yarn with supercritical carbon dioxide fluid. They found out that this procedure is more environmentally friendly and provides preservation of energy and other resources. Zhang et al. (2016a)  investigated the capacity of the additive polyethylenoglicol (PEG) with different molecular weights in the printing process instead of urea, which is responsible for series of environmental problems due to the high content of ammonium in the printing effluent. The results indicated use on determined product type due to the low cost and an ecological characteristic. Zhang et al. (2016b)  researched the adoption of CP by means of synthetization of three new special reactive disperser in the coloring process without water in woolen fabrics to replace the traditional dyes. Chen et al. (2017)  developed a tool for assessment of the level performance of water preservation process and pollution control using a CP technology. This new tool includes three indicators: reduction of water removal, reduction of water consumption and reduction of the assimilation of water in the process of dyeing and printing flannel fabrics. Xiao et al. (2017)  studied the introduction of CP in the dyeing process synthesizing series of multifunctional cation reactive dyes of low content of salt and found out reduction of the consumption of auxiliary chemical substances and fresh water.. Liang et al. (2018)  carried out a comprehensive study for the treatment of residual waters generated in different types of dyeing, The findings indicated that this proposed treatment was efficient and that the Total Organic Carbon (TOC), COD, and toxicity were reduced by approximately 70%, 80%, and 34.4–95.5%, respectively. Chen and Long (2018)  explored the influences of process parameters in the diffusion of an acid dye in a paste of sodium alginate, using an innovative procedure by means of cell, especially designed and built, which enabled the development of several cleaning processes with adequate and efficient deployment of chemical products and dyes in textile printing. Gong et al. (2018)  studied the use of biomass pigments as alternatives to the conventional synthetic dyes in the dyeing process and concluded that the adoption of CP in this process generated ecological textile. Also in 2018, Li et al. approached the synthetization of new polyurethane pigment adhesives cured by UV, soybean oil based, which are ecologically correct and made the reduction of power consumption and environment pollution in the textile printing process feasible. In Austria, Fresner (1998)  demonstrated the potential of the CP approach to solve environmental problems existing in the textile industries, obtaining 30% reduction in the use of water, reduction of the COD of residual waters by 30%, and 15% reduction in the gas consumption of the driers. Also in 1998, the Schramm's study proposed comparison and practical tests of process technologies from CP point of view, resulting in estimation of the general possibilities and limitations in conformity with integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC) and concluded that for textile dyeing, it was not possible to distinguish which the newest technology was. While Fresner et al. (2010)  carried out studies in industries that adopted CP and demonstrated that the consumption per production unit of industries from the surface treatment, food processing and the textile sectors could be reduced by 30–90%; the consumption of auxiliary materials could be reduced by 30–50%; and the consumption of power in the processes could be reduced by 15–25%. In Bangladesh, Rakib et al. (2017)  found out that the textile industries used modern and efficient power technologies, but there was still space for improvement of the energetic efficacy, such as reuse of some common residues as the high temperature gas discharge from power generators, boilers and finishing machines. Bhuiyan et al. (2018)  investigated the performance of innovation in the dyeing process using polyester fiber with natural henna dye, keeping the mechanical properties and the resistance to washing. Also in 2018, Hossain et al. found out the need to improve the conventional technology in the textile dyeing process by adoption of CP and recycling of the treated water for reduction of the water consumption and the volume of effluents. In Brazil, Silva et al. (2018)  studied innovations in the dyeing process using aqueous extracts obtained from eucalypt leaves in cotton fabrics, enabling replacement of high volumes of NaCl. In Cambodia, San et al. (2018)  estimated the industrial pollution load using the Industrial Pollution Projection System (IPPS) as environmental management tool and found out that the textile and garment sectors were the biggest generators of toxic chemical products in the soil and the air. They suggested adoption of residue minimization strategies, which include CP processes for future political guidelines to reduce industrial pollution. In Canada, Taylor (2006)  examined local and international initiatives, such as: education, financial incentives and regulatory compliance within the community stakeholders (including the government, NGOs, consultants and industry) in the adoption of CP programs and the respective barriers for their implementation. In Egypt, El-Gohary et al. (2013)  analyzed the CP opportunities for a group of five textile industries in relation to the end-of-tube treatment and concluded that the replacement of several chemical products enabled compliance with the governmental norms on treated effluents. Ibrahim et al. (2015)  assessed the replacement of the hazardous chemical products with non-polluting alternatives using beta-cyclodextrin or monochlorotriazinyl bcyclodextrin together with ultraviolet protection (UP) for the formulations in the printing process as eco-friendly reactive additives. In Slovenia, Petek and Glavic (2000)  concluded that the enforcement of CP programs needs long-term cooperation among governments, the university and the industry for the 3 phases: initiation, basic capacity level and maintenance of the program to be carried out and executed adequately. In the United States, Manring and Moore (2006)  demonstrated the quality of adopting CP practices in an organization, showing that reduction of the water toxicity and the harmful environmental effects is directly related to the success of the efforts to build, manager and maintain an inter-organizational network of different stakeholders. Thompson and Tong (2016)  carried a survey with 307 questionnaires to investigate fashion. They found that environmental concern may influence on the purchase intention of young American consumers for acquisition of bamboo textile and garment products. In India, Narayanaswamy and Scott (2001)  evaluated the CP experience in the textile blanking and dyeing clusters (socks) and demonstrated that the manufacturing units can be encouraged to adopt innovation strategies for the water preservation and reduction of the pollution of underground waters, as well as elimination of redundant process stages, toxic replacement, reuse of water and partial modernization of the technology. Nayak and Mishra (2016)  found out that the adoption of innovation in textiles brought alternative plant fibers, such as bamboo as a substitute of petrochemical based synthetic fibers. In Indonesia, Schaltegger et al. (2012)  investigated the adoption of environmental management accounting (EMA) to obtain relevant information for CP and inter-functional collaboration among environmental managers, production managers and accounting for the improvement of the general performance of their organizations from the financial and environmental points of view. In Iran, Ghazinoory (2005)  made interviews with specialists and directors of industries from different segments and upon analysis of the multiple criteria decision making method (MCDM) model and found out that the textile, garment and leather industries are those requiring priority in the implementation of CP in their manufacturing processes. Maryan and Montazer (2013)  studied the deployment of special techniques using new substances in the denim washing process reducing the water and power consumption and the production costs. In Malaysia, Amindoust and Saghafinia (2016)  developed a framework for decision-makers, who managed the suppliers from textile industry chain, grounded on a set of criteria derived from strict research in the existing literature. In Norway, Al-Yousfi (2004)  studied the implementation of CP options with 3-year payback, with investments in new air-flowing machine and improvements involving changes and actions in the manufacturing process control. In Pakistan, Ortolano et al. (2014)  found out that the adoption of CP provides results from energetic and environmental audits. They confirmed the lack of compliance with the environmental quality standards (ISO 14.000). Ali et al. (2016)  studied the recycling of residual waters generated by the textile processing of an industry using a membrane bioreactor (ultrafiltration) followed by reverse osmose, which enabled achieving environmental benefits, such as high removal of pollutants, reduction of emissions of CO2, reduction of pH, COB and BOD and their reuse even in washing and rinsing processes. In Romania, Dumitrescu et al. (2008)  found out the economic and environmental benefits, as well as the compliance with the national and the European Union legal requirements related to the environmental aspects generated by the introduction of the CP technology in pre-treatment of cotton done during the dyeing process. In Thailand, Pisitsak et al. (2018)found out that the adoption of CP in the textile industry can be achieved by means of replacement of certain synthetic substances with natural materials, thus, reducing risks to health and the environment because of their biodegradability.  3 Methods As stated before, this work was developed in the Brazilian textile industry aiming to identify how the economic and environmental gains resulting from CP utilization could meet the UN sustainable development goals. Central to the study presented here is the MIPS concept that is shown in detail in this section, along with the identification of the research method and respective data gathering techniques employed. 3.1 Research method and data gathering procedure This work identified how the utilization of CP practices in the Brazilian textile sector could generate economic advantages and environmental impact reductions as a way to contribute to the achievement of SDG. To attain that, the research method was chosen following the recommendations made by Yin (2009) , considering the “case study” as the research strategy to be assumed whenever the study developed tries to answer questions mostly associated to “how” and “why”, especially when the research deals with a current phenomenon in the real world where the boundaries between the subject and its context are indistinct. These are exactly the conditions observed in the present research which confirm that the case study was the adequate method to be used. To gather data during the case studies, the semi-structured interview was the technique chosen because it is considered the most adequate approach for quantitative research according to Bryman (1995)  and Collins and Hussey (2007) . To support the researchers in conducting the interviews an aide-memoire  was prepared including the relevant aspects to be considered during the interviews as a way to guarantee a common content in all them. To establish the number of cases to be considered, Yin (2009)  proposes two strategies: a) for the cases where similar results could be expected even before analyzing them, it is recommended the utilization of literal replication. In this situation, the study of two or three cases would be enough; and b) however, if different results are assumed, theoretical replication is suggested. In this condition more than 4 cases should be considered. Several previous researches employing case studies have demonstrated that economic and environmental gains can be obtained as a result of CP utilization (Paoli et al., 2013 ;Oliveira et al., 2015 ; Oliveira Neto et al., 2014 ; Sanches et al., 2018 ). Consequently, this work applied the literal replication as suggested by Yin (2009)  and two cases were selected to support it.  3.2 Selection of cases to be included in the research To select the companies to be included in the research, Patton (2014)  recommends the utilization of purposeful sampling, i.e., cases should be selected in such a way that researchers could obtain a significant amount of information relevant for their study. Among the strategies recommended by Patton (2014)  to choose purposeful samplings, it was decided to use the sampling of typical cases where those selected could contribute with pertinent information to assess the research questions posed. Therefore, the following criteria were established to select the companies to be encompassed in the case studies: a) the companies should belong to the Brazilian textile sector; b) they should have recently implemented CP practices; c) they should grant ample access of the researchers to the economic and environmental results of that implementation and d) the person responsible for CP implementation should be available to discuss with the researchers the details and eventual difficulties perceived. Based on those criteria and using the literal replication as per Yin (2009) , the following two companies located in the Sao Paulo State, Brazil, were chosen: Company A  – Is among the five largest denim producers in Brazil and provides constant investment in equipment renewal and expansion. It is a vertically integrated company, which produces denim from yarn to finished fabrics. Sustainable development and related environmental aspects are relevant concerns for the company management. The firm also recognizes that besides generating economic and environmental gains those factors are source of competitive advantage. Company B  – Is one of the largest yarns producing companies operating in Brazil. It manufactures several types and gauges of products using natural and synthetic materials. The company is constantly evaluating new approaches and technologies to reduce product costs at the same time they seek alternatives to minimize wastes and to reduce the impact of its operations on the environment.  3.3 Data analysis procedure - the MIPS (material input per service unit) concept To evaluate the economic and environmental advantages resulting from CP implementation, this paper uses the approach proposed by Oliveira Neto et al. (2014)  that encompasses three stages: data collection, economic assessment and environmental evaluation. In the first stage, data collection, the amounts of resources and emissions that were used before and after CP implementation were measured by their mass. Further the mass balance was developed, to calculate the quantity of materials consumption to achieve monthly production in order to quantify the resource total usage. The second stage is the economic assessment where the revenues and costs are identified to determine the economic values of involved before and after CP adoption. Phase three evaluates the environmental impact resulting from the resources employed also before and after CP. For this appraisal, this study employs the MIPS (Material Input per Service Unit) concept, developed by the Wuppertal Institute, which can evaluate the environmental changes allied to resource removal from Nature (Wuppertal Institute, 2015 ). MIPS refers to the entire life cycle of a product, from cradle to grave (Aoe and Michiyasu, 2005 ) and represents the “total material input that individuals move or extract from nature for the production of goods and the delivery of services” (Oliveira et al., 2016 , p. 685). MIPS is gauged in kg per service unit ( Stiller, 1999; Ritthoff et al., 2002 ). The material input comprises five compartments: biotic raw materials (agriculture and forestry goods and biomass that is removed but not used in the product manufacturing), abiotic raw materials (minerals and ores obtained as a result of mining operations and all related earth movements), erosion (possible effect of ploughing massive farmland areas), water (all mined or used freshwater streams) and air (air chemically treated or changed into another physical state) (Wuppertal Institute, 2015 ). The MIPS calculation identified the amount of material in the biotic, abiotic, erosion, water and air compartments, which are caused by the consumption of raw materials and other resources employed in the production process. Then, the amount consumed is multiplied by the intensity factors – MIF (mass intensity factors) as defined by Wuppertal Institute (2015) . As a result, MIT (material intensity toytal) is obtained by multiplying the resource mass by its respective MIF per compartment, as per Equation (1) .(1) MIT = M a s s  × M I F  B i o t i c   + M a s s × M I F  A b i o t i c   + +  M a s s  × M I F  E r o s i o n   + M a s s  × M I F  W a t e r   + M a s s  × M I F  A i r        The MIF factors used in this work are shown in Table 2  . For cotton, the United States data was considered and for electricity the world average was employed. In principle, the utilization of such intensity factor could represent some trouble. However, according to Oliveira Neto et al. (2014) , as the amounts are similar for the conditions considered in the case studies, they have been used in the MIPS calculations here. The product MASS x MIFX  in each compartment produces the Mass Intensity per Compartment (MIC). Then, to measure the total intensity factor before and after CP implementation, the MIPS (Material Input per Service Unit) was determined, as the sum of all compartments considered (Equation (1) ). Similar MIPS calculations have been used by numerous authors (Ritthoff et al., 2002 ; Aoe and Michiyasu, 2005 ; Federici et al., 2008 ; Giannetti and Almeida, 2006 ; Cavalett and Ortega, 2010 ; Oliveira Neto et al., 2010 ; Vendrametto et al., 2010 ; Monaco and Di Matteo, 2011 ; Spinelli et al., 2013 ; De Paoli et al., 2013 ; De Oliveira Neto and Sousa, 2014 ; Neto et al., 2014 ; De Oliveira Neto et al., 2015 ; Oliveira Neto et al., 2014 ).   4 Results In this section the case studies considered by this work are presented. Their focal objective was to show the CP practices implemented by the companies under study and how those actions relate to the Sustainable Development Goals. 4.1 Company A To obtain data related to CP practices implemented by Company A, a semi structured interview was conducted with both the Manufacturing Director and the Advanced Manufacturing Engineering Manager. In a 2-h conversation followed by a plant tour it was possible to learn that the company was in process of replacing all the old rapier looms by the more technologically advanced air jet weaving machines. The interviewees indicated that the reason for such change was three fold: the new technology produced denim fabrics at lower costs, the necessity to increase production capacity and the reduction of impact to the environment. Exploring in more depth these statements, the Manufacturing Director indicated that “the air jet technology consumed less electrical energy, had a higher production output and used less cotton yarn to produce a certain amount of indigo”. To clarify more this point, the Advanced Manufacturing Engineering Manager explained that every time a weft yarn is inserted to interlace the warp yarns, it leaves ends on both fabric sides. These ends are cut after selvedge formation, being kept tensioned until cut. In rapier machines, weft ends on both fabric sides. Because of machine characteristics, it is necessary that both weft ends are kept tensioned so that the rapier is able to take them up again at the next insertion. Air jet looms form weft ends only in one of the fabric sides. Consequently, air jet machine waste for weft yarn is 8 cm per insertion, while the waste generated by rapier machines is 14 cm per insertion. Questioning the interviewees about the technical evaluation of the economic and environmental impacts of the new technology, they indicated that only an economic evaluation was performed, since the environmental impact reduction was already clear as a result of the cotton yarn consumption reduction. Upon our request, the economic evaluation data was supplied, considering the same fabric style production for both weaving technologies (Table 3  ). Therefore, the process outputs were the same, that is, style X produced by the two kinds of weaving technologies. Thus, the variables were quantified in linear meters produced, using for comparison a 4,000,000 linear meters/month using the two different technologies. Cotton, electricity and compressed air were considered process entries. A workload of 720 h/month was considered. Loom operational speeds to produce this style is different from one technology to the other due to each machine construction characteristics. Air jet weaving looms produce at 880 RPM while rapier machines run at 490 RPM. Weft and warp yarns have different count, that is, a different mass volume for the same yarn length. The costs for the two kinds of yarns are different. According to the interviewees, weft yarns cost USD 0.874/Kg and warp USD 1.029/Kg. Electricity price is USD 0.080/kWh. Direct labor is the same for both technologies; therefore, it was not used in the comparison. Indirect manufacturing costs are allocated to products in direct proportion to workmanship, hence not interfering in the assessment performed. Based on those values it was possible to calculate the economic impact of both technologies as shown in Table 3 . As can be seen, air jet loom generates an economy of about USD 45 thousand per month or around USD 539 thousand per year. However, as the company did not perform a calculation of the reduction on the environmental impact generated by the new technology, the authors of this paper made an evaluation using the MIPS concept as follows. Using the same fabric quantities and data already mentioned, yarns used to produce discharged false selvedge count for 10 weft yarns in air jet machines and 40 weft yarns in rapier machines. The production efficiency is 91% and 89% for air jet and rapier machines respectively. Energy consumption is 4 kWh/machine and 8 kWh/machine. However, air jet machines use compressed air to operate and the energy consumption in the compressors is equivalent to 7 kWh/machine. Rapier machines do not use compressed air. With this data, the next stage was the electricity and yarn consumption calculation for the two technologies as shown in Table 4  . It is possible to note in Table 4  that air jet looms consume a lower quantity of both resources for the same amount of fabric produced. Henceforth, to check the environmental impact of both technologies, it was used the MIPS concept as described in the Methods section. For that purpose, the mass balance reduction identified in Table 4  was multiplied by the respective MIF shown in Table 2 , applying equation (1)  above. The results are summarized in Table 5  . The savings obtained by the new technology enabled the elimination of 288,781 ton per month of resources represented mainly by air followed by abiotic materials. This case shows that the CP practice adopted (replace old technology by a new one) generates lower costs and reduced environmental impact. Analyzing these results in light of the Sustainable Development Goals, it is possible to identify contributions for four specific goals: a) 12 – Sustainable production and consumption, as the adoption of the new technology with lower costs and less ecological influence grants the company more competitiveness and sustainable production; b) 9 – Industry, innovation and infra-structure, because the new technology represents an innovation in terms of industrial process and its related infra-structure; and finally, the results obtained also contribute to the achievement of goal c) 15 – Protect the terrestrial life, once the reduced cotton consumption represents a decrease in material sent to landfills, contributing to less contamination of the environment.  4.2 Company B This company decided to replace the existing yarn producing equipment (line) by a new one seeking for reduced costs, additional capacity to meet market demand and less environmental impact as competitive factors to face a fierce competition against imports from Far East. To evaluate the economic and environmental advantage for the new production line, operational data for the old and the new equipment was obtained as shown in Table 6  . Table 6  shows the quantitative data for both the old and new production process, considering the cotton input per month (Kg/month) as well as the material discarded during manufacturing (Kg/month), the electric energy consumed (kWh/month), the final yarn output obtained (Kg/month) and the specific electric energy consumption (kWh/Kg of yarn). As can be seen, the new process generates 97% of additional yarn volume production per month, consuming less 42% of electric energy per Kg of yarn produced and less 6 tons of wastes as compared to the old production system. Despite the evident advantage of the new line in terms of both economic and environmental advantages, as part of the case study the researchers conducted formal evaluations as described as follows. The economic advantage of the new line in relation to the old one was calculated as shown in Table 7  . In terms of cotton consumption, the new manufacturing process generated a monthly saving of USD 9 thousand, the economy in electric energy costs amounted to USD 39 thousand per month, hence generating a total monthly cost reduction of USD 48 thousand or USD 582 thousand per year. Taking into consideration that for the new line Company B invested USD 1.5 million, the economies obtained generated a return on investment of 27% per year, which is very adequate considering a local average yearly capital cost of 18%. Furthermore, the environmental impact reduction was also performed using the MIPS concept. For that purpose, the calculations were made as shown in Table 8  . The results obtained in Table 8  are self-explanatory: the new production line obtained an environmental impact reduction equivalent of 76,623 ton per month, coming mainly from the reduction of air utilization resulting from less cotton and electric energy used in the new process. This case also demonstrates that the CP practice implemented (replacing old equipment by a new one) produces lower costs and reduced environmental impact. Examining these outcomes considering the Sustainable Development Goals, it is conceivable to recognize contributions for three explicit goals: a) 12 – Sustainable production and consumption, as the new equipment enabled the achievement of lower costs and less environmental effects which assured increased competitiveness and sustainable production for Company B; b) 9 – Industry, innovation and infra-structure, because the new production system characterizes an innovation for the manufacturing process considered and its associated infra-structure; and finally, the results shown also contribute to the accomplishment of goal c) 15 – Protect the terrestrial life, since the abridged cotton utilization signifies a diminution in landfills utilization, contributing to less pollution of the environment.   5 Discussion Initially, this research contributes with the evaluation of the economic gains resulting from CP adoption in the textile industry by measuring the return on investment generated by the savings obtained, allowing a better decision making by managers when considering the acquisition of new equipment. This goes in line with Kiran-Ciliz (2003) , Al-Yousfi (2004) , Ozturk et al. (2014) , Ozturk et al. (2015) , Ozturket al. (2016a) and Ozturk et al. (2016b)  who used the payback to evaluate the investment to gauge the return provided by CP implementation. These quantitative approaches differ from the qualitative evaluations to show the cost reductions resulting from CP utilization in textile companies as those performed by Fresner (1998) , Schaltegger et al. (2012) , Alkaya and Demirer (2014b) , Rakib et al. (2017)  and Gong et al. (2018) . Furthermore, the findings of this research show that by the replacement of old equipment by more recent technology permitted to identify the reductions in environmental impacts obtained when CP practices were adopted by textile industries through the MIPS utilization. This allowed managers to visualize the quantitative benefits generated in the biotic, abiotic, water, air and erosion compartments caused by reductions in the consumption of raw materials (cotton) and electric energy, besides the reduction in waste generation during the industrial processes. This differs from the environmental advantages shown by Petek and Glavic (2000) , Nayak and Mishra (2016) , Thompson and Tong (2016)  and Bhuiyan et al. (2018)  who dealt with material replacement or the researches conducted by Baban et al. (2010) , El-Gohary et al. (2013) , Amindoust and Saghafinia (2016) , Ali et al. (2016) , Morali et al. (2016) ,Zang et al. (2016a ,b) , Chen et al. (2017) , Yukseler et al. (2017) , Hossain et al. (2018) , Liang et al. (2018) , Ozturk and Cinperi (2018) , Pesitsak et al. (2018)  and San et al. (2018)  that appraised the reduction in waste discharged into the environment rather than evaluating their overall environmental impacts. This study also showed how economic and environmental gains resulting from CP adoption contribute directly to the Sustainable Development Goals 9, 12 and 15 by highlighting the inclusive and sustainable industrialization, fostering innovation by ensuring sustainable production patterns, as well as promoting the sustainable utilization of existing ecosystems coming from the reductions in basic raw materials, electricity consumption and minimization of industrial waste generation through technological innovation and modern equipment in the Brazilian industries surveyed. This is different from many other studies that presented reduction in environmental impacts but with no direct identification of the related SDG (Schramm, 1998 ; Narayanaswamy and Scott, 2001 ; Ghazinoory, 2005 ; Taylor, 2006 ; Manring and Moore, 2006 ; Dumitrescu et al., 2008 ; Fresner et al., 2010 ; Tong et al., 2012 ; Yuan et al., 2013 ; Zhang et al., 2013 ; Maryan and Montazer, 2013 ; Long et al., 2014 ; Ortolano et al., 2014 ; Alkaya and Demirer, 2014a , Baydar et; al. 2015; Ibrahim et al., 2015 ; Zang et al. 2016a ,b ; Xiao et al., 2017 ; Benli and Bahtiyari, 2015 ; Chen and Long, 2018 ; Li et al., 2018 ; Silva et al., 2018 ).  6 Conclusions In this research, it was concluded that the adoption of CP practices in Brazilian textile industries through technological innovation made it possible to highlight the economic and environmental gains relating those to SDGs 9, 12 and 15. This brings contributions to both theory and practice. To the body of knowledge of Cleaner Production, this study was able to demonstrate that the achievements resulting from CP implementation can contribute to the accomplishment of SDGs, aspect that was not broadly explored in the extant literature. Furthermore, this research allows decision-makers in the textile industry to adopt the approaches presented herein to evaluate the resources to be allocated in process improvements and their financial and environmental impacts, as well as environmental strategies in relation to SDGs. As most researches, this study has some limitations. Firstly, the results obtained here cannot be generalized because it was carried out in only two industries of the Brazilian textile segment. Indeed, the utilization of case studies is a limitation when a broader degree of generalization is required. Consequently, expanding the research for a larger number of companies and other industrial segments, using more structured and statistical validated research strategy can be posed as suggestions for future works.
