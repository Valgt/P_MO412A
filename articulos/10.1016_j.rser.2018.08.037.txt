                  It is believed that the environment is largely susceptible to changes in human behavior and the constant advances in using new technologies. Different challenges with regard to housing, basic services, food, health, education, and natural resources must be overcome as it is expected an urban population growth in the upcoming decades. Thereby, a proposal has been formulated herein with the aim of understanding the correlation between a group of socioeconomic and environmental variables that tend to represent how cities of a metropolitan region in Brazil behave towards the duality of social development and electricity use. For such a purpose, a spatial econometric analysis has been conducted on sets of variables that are associated with sustainable development goals (SDGs) established to understand social vulnerabilities, economy, electricity use, health and population. The Euclidean distance has been used on standardized variables for the 39 cities in the Metropolitan Region of Paraíba Valley and North Coast as an alternative to that suggested by spatial econometrics. The region under study presents hub cities whose economies are mainly based on industry, trade and services. The results show good consistency and reveal the correlation between SDGs as regards care for vulnerable people, mainly women, children and the elderly.

Centro Estadual de Educação Tecnológica Paula Souza (CEETEPS), Faculdade de Tecnologia de Guaratinguetá Avenida Prof. João Rodrigues Alckmin, 1501 Guaratinguetá SP Brazil       It is believed that the environment is largely susceptible to changes in human behavior and the constant advances in using new technologies. Different challenges with regard to housing, basic services, food, health, education, and natural resources must be overcome as it is expected an urban population growth in the upcoming decades. Thereby, a proposal has been formulated herein with the aim of understanding the correlation between a group of socioeconomic and environmental variables that tend to represent how cities of a metropolitan region in Brazil behave towards the duality of social development and electricity use. For such a purpose, a spatial econometric analysis has been conducted on sets of variables that are associated with sustainable development goals (SDGs) established to understand social vulnerabilities, economy, electricity use, health and population. The Euclidean distance has been used on standardized variables for the 39 cities in the Metropolitan Region of Paraíba Valley and North Coast as an alternative to that suggested by spatial econometrics. The region under study presents hub cities whose economies are mainly based on industry, trade and services. The results show good consistency and reveal the correlation between SDGs as regards care for vulnerable people, mainly women, children and the elderly.   Keywords Spatial econometric analysis  Sustainable development goals  Electricity use  Social vulnerabilities    1 Introduction Identifying a sustainable human act suggests a reflection of the past habits and desires in order to enable new technologies to be offered and meet the basic demands in various poor regions of the world, meeting the expectations of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)1  1 1-No poverty; 2-Zero hunger; 3-Good health and well-being; 4- Quality education; 5-Gender equality; 6-Clean water and sanitation; 7-Affordable and clean energy; 8-Decent work and economic growth; 9-Industry, innovation and infrastructure; 10-Reduced inequalities; 12-Responsible consumption and production; 13-Climate action; 14-Life below water; 15-Life on land; 16-Peace, justice and strong institutions; 17-Partnerships for the goals.   suggested by the United Nations, mainly in meeting the wishes of future generations [1] . For this reflection, the duality 'man-nature' must be understood as essential for the understanding of sustainable human acts, showing their choices in the places where they live. Since the discovery of fire, humanity has been exploiting much more than what nature can offer, thus rendering less than it should to restore its conditions before the aforementioned rampant exploitation of resources. According to [2] , reinventing human thought (and/or behavior) is enough for a minimally significant change in current conditions to provide better expectations for future generations. Human behavior has been adaptable along many years, and changeable under pressure of both natural resource consumption and energy use for producing and using materials and technology. As an example to represent changes in human behavior [3] , argue that the relationships between energy consumption, the economy and human well-being can differentiate less developed countries from other more affluent ones, and this may be perceived by the improvement of indicators such as life expectancy, infant mortality and economic development. Such relationship occurs effectively when the interconnection between these areas is perceived - this is a very vague concept of the quality of life of citizens who hardly ever discuss the possibility of any kind of environmental gains to serve future generations. As regards sustainability of cities, there are different challenges to be overcome concerning urban population growth, which is expected to double in 2050 if compared to the current situation. Among these challenges, there are housing, infrastructure, basic services, food security, health, education, decent work and natural resources [4] . It is believed that much of the environment is susceptible to changes in human behavior and the constant advances in using new technologies [5] . understand that the sustainability will be achieved if smart energy technologies are possible, energetically safe, environmentally benign, economically feasible, commercially viable, socially acceptable, integrative and reliable. Thus, Malthus's theory, which indicates that environmental damage is caused by arrangements formed by population growth, overshadows human capacity to produce (food, among other resources), thus it is not going not be worked on herein. Instead, Boserup's theory has been used [6]  by which it is understood that there is a great opportunity for technological innovation when population growth is considered to be fast, especially the one in urban areas. Global challenges have been partly overcome, but there is still a wide range of non-serviced communities, among other issues, by modern energy technologies (mainly cleaner and renewable energy technologies such as photovoltaic and wind power), which makes them coexist with rudimentary energy conditions. Rudimentary energy conditions are described by the undesirable sources – based on coal, petroleum products and other poor sources of energy, which are never renewable and very polluting –, without minimum conditions for thermal comfort, cooking or even basic sanitary conditions. According to [4] , around 10% of the world's population still lives under poor sanitary conditions, and one third do not have access to electricity. If the sustainability issue is underpinned by access to modern energy technologies (preferably less polluting and technically more efficient), then the majority of women, children and the elderly are left out of it. Mercilessly, any group that does not contribute minimally to the consumer market is excluded from having access to these technologies (this corresponds to the ‘technological threshold’ approach for energy poverty described by [7] ). Socioeconomic indicators have not fully portrayed the existence of these groups as elements of change in the process of consumption of goods and services, and therefore their expectations of using modern energy technologies are not (or are partially) met. This fact, however, must be taken into account by government agencies, given that they can indirectly influence future choices of types of consumption and growth perception, even though they are consumers who offer a very small economic contribution to the new energy technology market. It is routinely perceived that women, their children and elderly people consistently are a large portion of the population, which is vulnerable to various essential services to human activity. This same area coexists under unfavorable working conditions, precarious basic health care and sanitary services. This has occurred in several countries of the world on all continents, from the least to the most developed. In cities that make up the Metropolitan Region of Paraíba Valley and Northern Coast (MRPVNC), socioeconomic aspects have contributed more effectively to the duality man-environment. It is located in eastern São Paulo state and between the strongest economies in Brazil (São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro) and surrounded by Mantiqueira and Serra do Mar Mountains, MRPVNC presents a socioeconomic development characteristic by the Paraíba do Sul River, which crosses the whole region. This is a historically relevant region for Brazil, since there were the main agricultural and livestock riches of the early 19th century - however, in the beginning of the 20th century, driven by the newly installed industry in the State of São Paulo, social and economic issues have changed dramatically [8] . characterized the MRPVNC as for its development according to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Human Development Index (HDI), which identifies that cities by the Paraíba do Sul River have been favored due to development characteristics, thus being closer to what is expected from a region to meet the targets of the Millennium Development Goals (and, consequently, SDGs). On the other hand, less developed cities located both in the surroundings of Serra da Mantiqueira and around Serra do Mar, coexist in particular conditions of lower GDP and HDI, which means that the nexus health-economics-education is underprivileged in cities belonging to these mountainous areas. This article aims to present interactions between MRPVNC cities in the context of SDGs, particularly the existing correlations between socioeconomic characteristics and electricity use. For this, the studied variables collected from a public database were correlated to the 17 SDGs as classified by the UN, with a strong correlation with the first 12 SDGs for the present analysis. Its conceptual framework is based on the spatial econometric analysis from which distances between studied variables, initially considered strongly correlated with each other, are calculated. From this analysis, it is sought to understand the current social, economic and energy conditions of RMVPLN correlated to SDGs.  2 Literature review In order to be exclusively dedicated to a city's economic growth, a decision-maker must understand the small but important contributions of choices made by individuals. From the point of view of energy supply and demand, each small contribution allows individuals to significantly and positively affect the characteristics of a sustainable life that protects and frees people who are vulnerable to modern energy technologies in small and large regions [9] . emphasize that the social and technological dimensions are essential for the sustainability, but the availability of the necessary resources at the level of technological infrastructure is limiting for some groups of people. Among these groups, it can be highlighted the social vulnerability faced by low per capita income people that demands for modern and clean energy (e.g. photovoltaics) but need greater financial support for that. The protection stated herein concerns the way in which technology is offered to a group of individuals or cities in the face of an urbanization process. This is reflected in mechanisms (from the simplest to the most sophisticated) that can be associated with the development of cities, even though such mechanisms are associated with behavioral changes and new paths to a culture that has already been fostered by a population. One example is the challenge posed to China to meet sustainable development aspirations in the face of an intense urbanization process over the past 30 years, in contrast with the proposed reduction of energy consumption suggested by the systematization of energy efficiency in industrial processes [10,11] . On the other hand, technological liberation of a population refers to offering an opportunity to use less expensive technologies or mechanisms, which lead to a disconnection from the usual way of consuming energy, such as using electricity to cook food (by using a microwave oven), which can be replaced by the use of LPG or biogas (e.g. from biomass). In addition to protection and technological liberation, there is flexibility whose main result is an opportunity for each individual to independently choose the extent to which they use these technologies as time elapses. As regards using energy technologies [12] , define flexibility as energy users who are able to choose how, when or where energy is demanded, moreover [13] , indicate that it is also the ability to increase or decrease its use over a given period of time [14] . supports the idea that individual flexibility depends on collective proposals in systems that allow and restrict these choices and there is a dependence on decisions associated with energy services being provided. With respect to exclusively cultural aspects, it is believed that a simplified comparison of the degree to which each individual contributes to society, i.e. to understand the essence of a group of individuals and their cultures, it is necessary to experience it directly [15] . Thus, the same authors infer that there is no way to predict that individuals who work in different areas of expertise perform or engage in their tasks in the same way, which allows discussing technological flexibility. This thought contributes to the idea that one should not accept a simplified behavioral change that includes all kinds of cultures into the same set of intentions. As regards a sustainable use of resources that contributes towards clean and accessible energy transformation to all, one must understand the performances of technologies suggested and demanded by each region in comparison with their cultures and beliefs. Furthermore [13] , characterize social flexibility, especially that associated with fluctuating prices, as motivation to consumers, given that the their decision may or may not be included as regards the issue of technological flexibility. To a certain extent, the social distance of a few groups of people can be totally associated with distances of socioeconomic variables involved, as well as socioenvironmental ones. In some studies [4,14,16–22] , the opportunity to access technologies (or actions) has been neglected for a large portion of society, especially women, children and the elderly, and deemed important for the development of cities and mitigation of their ills. There is a significant range between the minimum requirements and what is possible to achieve in terms of reasonable SDGs, although its value could not be easily defined. In order to meet the social demands, in the face of mutually correlated parameters, it is possible to observe at what distances individual demands are from regional demands. Thus, the closer individual characteristics are to regional ones, the more evident the achievement of SDGs becomes; otherwise, individual cases should become isolated elements (within the regions to which they belong) for attaining SDGs.  3 Study region characterization Spatial data use aims to explain how interaction occurs between two neighborhoods, either being close to each other or not. Such proximity is relevant from the point of view of similarities among populations, although there are naturally obvious characteristics of such an interaction between people, groups, cities or regions, which may hinder a proper understanding of these similarities. For the MRPVNC, the present object of study, there is a range of possibilities to show possible interactions between its cities and government regions. A possible path chosen herein to explain the location of existing interactions in the region was the assertion that there is a correlation between socioeconomic and environmental characteristics arising from both hub cities and their neighborhoods, as proposed by [8] . In such work, consistent factors are identified as being correlated to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and can contribute to understanding this issue. The studied region belongs to the state of São Paulo (see  Fig. 1 ), in the southeastern region of Brazil, being composed of a river basin (represented by the Paraíba do Sul River) supplied by several small water sources (small rivers), and surrounded by two chains of mountains (Serra da Mantiqueira, inland of the continent, and Serra do Mar, towards the coast). This naturally suggests the identification of a region characterized by marked distinctions, first by its geographic condition and finally by the historical choices promoted by evolution of socioeconomic characteristics. From a socioeconomic standpoint, an agricultural production period nearer the city of Rio de Janeiro was initially observed in this region to meet the needs of a population towards the east. Subsequently, the region has been heavily industrialized, mainly by the aeronautics and automobile industries. The region is composed of 39 cities, divided into five regions of government, as presented in  Table 1  and  Fig. 2 , in which the leading hub cities of each region are highlighted. The highlighted hub cities were chosen as proposed by (SÃO PAULO, 2012) and seconded by (Santos et al., 2016) in accordance with socioeconomic characteristics and their historical factors of strong influence on the choices of their neighborhoods. Geographically, the same cities in Table 1  can be reclassified into new groups of cities (micro regions) belonging to the banks of Paraíba do Sul River (M1 ) by Serra do Mar, the coast (M2 ) by Serra do Mar, mainland (M3 ) by Serra da Mantiqueira (M4 ), as described in  Table 2  and  Fig. 3. [8]  suggest that this reclassification presents the socioeconomic factors associated with the MDGs quite well to characterize region M1  as the one with optimal socioeconomic indicators, as opposed to the M3  and M4  regions, which are more vulnerable to more fierce economic growth activities. It should be noted that cities in the M2  micro region and the city of Ilhabela (belonging to M3 ) were not included by [8] , however, they will be considered in the present study. To support this reclassification, spatial econometric modeling is suggested in order to evaluate the correlation among energy use (bias to electricity use), socioeconomic and social-environmental variables associated with the SDGs.  4 Euclidean distances applied to spatial econometrics Euclidean distances are usually applied to geographical positions of elements (latitude and longitude) or in binary mode, such as the distance between two elements [24] . In fact, this is the most commonly applied method, although the present article suggests choosing Euclidean distances based on socioeconomic variables in order to propose a different path from what is commonly chosen in spatial econometrics. According to [25] , different types of distances can be structured and used, such as those that associate economic variables, which are used to explain the proximity between cities and regions, which does not imply their physical position. As an example, the same author states that a covariance matrix can be used as one of these economic distances between two elements i  or j  belonging to a sample space Ω. The Euclidean distance will be thus applied in the spatial econometric analysis. In this article, the application of Euclidean distances refers to the intention of associating different types of socioeconomic and socioenvironmental variables in the same set of data to be managed. These distances must be calculated with 79 quantitative variables having a certain degree of correlation with each other, i.e. greater than 0.5 [26] , represented by the information available in a public database of socioeconomic data [27]  (whose description of the correlated variables are included in the table corresponding to each sector studied) for the 39 MRPVNC cities (see Table 1 ). These variables are initially standardized in Z (Normal Standard) with the aim of smoothing the effects of the presence of outliers among the pieces of information from studied cities, since these present very distinct economic features [8] . The benefit of using this model to the present analysis is to transform a normally qualitative analysis into a quantitative one in order to represent the differences or similarities between the MRPVNC cities from the point of view of the variables correlated to the set of SDGs. One of the possible limitations of the present modeling is the composition of variables with strongly discrepant elements (outliers) among them, which can cause misinterpretations about the expected value for the correlation of attributes. Some econometric variables were included in the spatial econometric analysis through using maps to justify the use of GIS (Geographic Information System) tool with the ArcGIS software [28] . These analyses were carried out by sectors associated with SDGs: economy, population, electricity, health, education, environment, and social vulnerability (women, children and elderly individuals). From the interactions proposed by the spatial econometric modeling herein, the ones existing between the correlations of studied variables are used, from which perceptions are understood as the role of neighborhoods and cities by means of allocating variables into a thematic (presented in Section 6 ) in order to allow evaluating how interrelationships are defined by the MRPVNC cities. Some neighborhood models of hub cities (even those with common boundaries) do not necessarily indicate important relations of proximity, such as geological features like a river or a mountain, which bring them together physically. This, however, does not imply a real association between cities, as it is intended to use, in fact, in the interrelations studied on SDGs, but it can suggest a new way of contributing to meet the demands of people from MRPVNC cities under direct vulnerability conditions. Moreover, it enables cities to understand opportunities for collaboration among them, as suggested by SGD 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).  5 Spatial econometric modeling The spatial econometric modeling applied herein allows discussing the existence of possible interactions between two elements of a group of cities or regions. The degree presented for each possible interaction is measured by the distances between these elements, if it is possible to establish a grouping pattern about the information under study [29] . In the case being studied herein, the socioeconomic variables correlated to energy use suggest information that may be associated with the characteristics expected by SDGs, thereby, it will be considered a relevant aspect for the spatial study because it contains important evidences regarding the similarities or distinctions between studied cities. The MRPVNC cities and Euclidean distances among variables considered for each MRPVNC city will be used in the analysis. Euclidean distance can be understood as the shortest distance between two points, which is the smallest distance between the characteristics of MRPVNC cities in the present work. In order to identify the distances between the 39 MRPVNC cities, it is suggested that a couple of cities, A and B, defined by the set of n distinct variables, where A  = (  A  1   ,  A  2   , … ,  A  n   )    and B  = ( B  1   ,  B  2   , … ,  B  n    )  ,    present as Euclidean distance the value given by Eq. (1) .(1) d  A  ,  B    = ( A  1   −  B  1    )  2   +  ( A  2   −  B  2    )  2   + … +  ( A  n   −  B  n    )  2     = ∑ i  = 1   n   ( A  i   −  B  i    )  2           Euclidean distances will be used differently from how they are typically presented in traditional spatial econometrics, which uses interactions between two neighborhoods as a common interaction element, represented by an intersection point or by a common boundary between the so-called a priori neighboring elements [30] . Thus, this article will make use of the spatial econometric analysis with the aim of explaining the distances between neighborhoods by being based on socioeconomic or socio-environmental variables of MRPVNC cities. The eight steps considered for this spatial econometric analysis are:a. Selecting the variables of the 39 cities that make up the MRPVNC which can are their socioeconomic and environmental characteristics (in this case, through the 79 quantitative variables and three qualitative variables);  b. Transformation of quantitative variables considered herein according to a standard normal distribution (see Eq. (2) ), in which X, X  ̅    and σ    are the observation values, the mean and standard deviation of the studied variables, respectively;(2) Z  = X  −  X  ̅   S    ~  N  ( 0 , 1 )       c. Calculating Pearson's correlation (see Eq. (3) ) between variables mentioned in item b, in order to justify the choice of variables, where x  ̅    and y  ̅    are the sample means of X and Y, respectively; S  X       and S  Y     are the sample standard deviations of X and Y, respectively; the value of r  X  ,  Y      varies between −1 and 1, given that the closer it is to −1 and 1, the variables are said to be highly correlated with each other, whilst once close to 0 (zero), it is said that the variables are not correlated with each other;(3) r  X  ,  Y    = ∑ i  = 1   n   ( x  i   −  x  ̅   )  (  y  i   −  y  ̅  )    S  X   *  S  Y           d. Calculating Euclidian distances (presented in Eq. (1) ) between all variables studied for selected cities as being correlated with each other;  e. Designing the proximity matrix (spatial data) by using Euclidean distances of the 39 cities over the 79 variables transformed in item (b) - the nearest neighborhoods will be identified by borders with common characteristics;  f. Calculating weights δ  i    , which are the sum of the i-th  line of the proximity matrix that is going to are the contribution of each i-th  city on the proximities presented by the 79 variables chosen in item (a);  g. Designing the weighing matrix W  = ( w  ij    )  ,    in which w  ij   = 1  δ  i        are the values of the weights of each city i  in all variables j ;  h. Construction of vector Wx   , where each vector x  is the standardized values of each of the 79 studied variables; to technically determine each city's degree of interaction with each studied variable, the sum of Wx  values was considered to suggest sets of data represented by intervals that may or may not suggest patterns of influence of hub cities on their neighborhoods.     6 Analysis of results As a significant element of the present analysis, there was a favorable condition in the MRPVNC concerning the geographical position of each city, given that the highest ratings in the ratio of HDI to GDP (see  Fig. 4 ) were achieved by those located along the Paraíba do Sul River banks up to a certain point represented by cities which are closer to Rio de Janeiro (at its far east) and its coastal cities. In this way, the high, moderate and low attributes represent the association between HDI and GDP, of which the highest index (‘High’) is applied to regions with better economic and social conditions. At the other extreme, the opposite attribute (‘Low’) is related to vulnerabilities that are more evident. The same concept can be extended to the other correlations that use similar attributes. Indicators such as the HDI and GDP, or GDP per capita, have been used to justify the economic and social development interactions among countries, regions and cities around the world [8,31] , as well as the energy use associated with these variables. These ratios of cities in the studied region seem to evidence elements associated with neighborhoods of a few cities, once optimal indicators were achieved by the cities highlighted in Table 2  and Fig. 3 , which make up micro regions M1  and M2 . This fact evidences the interaction between neighborhoods of hub cities in each government region cited in Table 1 . Possible explanations for this lie in the fact that MRPVNC cities were urbanized by focusing on trade and services in the early twentieth century [32] , largely on the economic activities of smaller cities. Moreover, the fact that the industrial sector has been developed mainly in hub cities and some of its neighboring cities is an important contribution to develop their activities, mainly after the late twentieth century, thus observing a positive socioeconomic development around hub cities. On the other hand, in Fig. 4 , cities represented by darker colors are the least developed in accordance with the HDI-GDP ratio (associated with micro regions M3  and M4 ), as [8]  have similarly observed when studying relations of socioeconomic variables with the MDGs. As for discussing the themes of education, health and income suggested by the HDI and "wealth generated by cities", as suggested by the GDP, propose a degree of proximity between cities that make up micro regions M1  and M2 . This fact allows assuming a reclassification of regions of government presented herein for micro regions (see Table 2 ). In order to support the idea that hub cities influence neighborhoods, it was found that their interactions influence smaller cities (mainly cities belonging to micro regions M3  and M4 ) on socioeconomic, socio-environmental and energy use relations and SDGs achievement, which make social, electricity, population, health and economic dimensions key elements to characterize whether the SDGs have been attained. The cities located in micro regions M1  and M2 are the ones with the majority of high or moderately high attributes due to their high GDP, which is well correlated to the better HDI. From this initial perception, it was understood that the interactions of studied variables follows a certain association with each SDG, according to      Tables 3–7 , which show the dimensions of social vulnerability, electricity, population, economy and health (besides the dimensions associated with these tables, such as the environmental and educational dimensions that have not been dissociated), respectively. In order to understand these interactions between the variables and SDGs, the proximities between cities studied by the contribution of each variable on the presented social conditions were evaluated, which leads to understanding the importance of SDGs for the MRPVNC development. As regards social vulnerability, different degrees of vulnerability have been identified (see  Fig. 5 ), with which all variables presented in Table 3  are associated. Cities that have a lower Wx    (item h, Section 5 ) value (in this case, degree 4) are the ones with the best conditions of vulnerability in comparison with neighborhoods; very high values of Wx    (values of 1 or 7) suggest groups of cities with less prominent interactions with neighborhoods concerning social vulnerabilities to which populations are subjected. To exemplify, the city of São José dos Campos (see Fig. 2 ), located in the extreme left map of Fig. 5 , presents around its urban neighborhood two cities with extreme and opposite vulnerabilities (grade 1 for Monteiro Lobato and grade 7 to Igaratá). According to the electricity dimension suggested in Table 4 , three groups of electricity consumption – high, moderate and low – presented in  Fig. 6 , are highlighted, in which the cities of São José dos Campos, Jacareí, Taubaté and Pindamonhangaba stand out due to having a high degree, since they are cities with industrial features. This fact, however, does not imply the willingness of neighboring cities to follow this trend in electricity consumption. In the other groups, the cities of Caraguatatuba, Guaratinguetá and Cruzeiro (hub cities) and other cities with economies that are typically based on trade and services, as well as cities with low indicators, predominantly small cities, have characteristics, which are also associated with trade and services. Among the population aspects of MRPVNC cities, urban or rural characteristics are observed (see Table 5  and  Fig. 7 ). It is inferred that cities belonging to micro regions M1  (except for Caçapava, Roseira, Aparecida and Silveiras) and M2  are similar as regards population characteristics (mainly urban). Differently, but with a typical rural profile, micro regions M3  and M4  show greater proximity to each other from the same aspect. Physically, this is the population base that is consistent with the development of cities around the Paraíba do Sul River, which cuts across the Metropolitan Region from west to east. As regards the economic dimension, it is worth mentioning the characteristics of hub cities (Taubaté, São José dos Campos and Guaratinguetá), besides Pindamonhangaba, Jacareí and coastal towns (see  Fig. 8 ), on account of presenting optimal economic results in the region, which are identified as micro regions M1  and M2  (according to Table 2 ). On the other hand, cities belonging to micro regions M3  and M4  are the ones with less developed economies. Fig. 8  shows, according to variables presented in Table 6 , that the economic development of MRPVNC is better (High or Moderately high) in micro regions M1  and M2 , mainly in the cities of Taubaté, Pindamonhangaba, São José dos Campos, Jacareí and Ilhabela. This last city is an exception in micro region M3 , due to the tourist development characteristics of the city, which is located on an island. This demonstrates the proximity of these cities to the economic dimension and a greater distance from cities belonging to micro regions M3  and M4 , which are in the low economic development (Low and Moderately Low) as regards the most developed neighborhoods (M1  and M2 ). As regards the health dimension, cities that better meet the studied variables (see Table 7 ) are highlighted in  Fig. 9  (High, Moderately high and Moderate), thus representing greater proximity to hub cities and their main neighborhoods (micro regions M1 , except for Caçapava and Potim, and M2 ), and the moderately low group (Moderately low and Low), represented by micro regions M3  (except for Ilhabela, which is closer to M1  and M2 ) and M4 . In the case of the High and Moderate High groups, the associated cities are located in both the Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira, and far from the Paraíba do Sul riverbed. 6.1 Economic and electricity use dimensions By assuming that a statistical/mathematical model can characterize a city as for its development, it is expected that it will result in an opportunity for cities to understand their needs and their contributions to neighborhoods, which are interacting factors regarding the studied aspects. From the point of view of traditional econometrics, economic development would not be characterized without imposing a comprising interaction between variables of these cities, i.e. a quite important fact for the present analysis. Systematically, electricity use has offered a great opportunity for regions, such as the MRPVNC, to understand the individual role of each city or region of government in their overall development. This is because the benefits generated by local and regional urban planning (in which electricity is a determining factor for including public policies) are derived from the possibilities generated by interrelations between the economic variables and electricity use. Thus, cities’ conditions are improved, which contributes to priority service and a reduction of vulnerabilities to which some groups of people would be exposed. According to  Fig. 10 , most cities in micro regions M1  and M2 , as presented in the Table 2 , have similar features due to an economic development involving high electricity consumption, whereas cities in micro regions M3  and M4  are similar to each other by presenting low electricity consumption. Even though some neighborhoods propose interaction among themselves through the studied variables, it is not reflected in development for all micro regions. The cities of Taubaté, São José dos Campos, Jacareí and Pindamonhangaba, which have high or moderately high ratings (see Fig. 10 ), have associated the growth of their economies with electricity consumption well, mainly as a result of their industrial features. Cities in micro region M2 , as well as Guaratinguetá, Lorena and Canas (of the M1 micro region) have lessened conditions in the duality economy and electricity, since their economies are more traditionally based on trade and services. On the other hand, economic conditions of cities in micro regions M3 and M4  have lower ratings in the economy-electricity duality, with low or moderately low.  6.2 Vulnerable (women, children and elderly individuals) and electricity use An analysis of conditions to support the vulnerability condition of women, children and elderly individuals associated with electricity use makes it possible to infer that cities in micro regions M1  and M2 , such as Jacareí, São José dos Campos, Taubaté and Pindamonhangaba, have been positively highlighted due to meeting their basic needs (see  Fig. 11 ). On the other hand, there is a poor interaction between social vulnerability and electricity use in the cities of Igaratá, Santa Branca, Santo Antônio do Pinhal, Lagoinha, Aparecida, Roseira, Silveiras and Queluz. This fact suggests less favorable conditions for achieving SDGs concerning the issue of vulnerabilities (SGD - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 11), therefore being more distant than other cities in the MRPVNC. Thus, it can be seen that cities with a positive attitude (Good) towards meeting the basic needs of women, children and elderly individuals have slightly influenced some neighboring cities with respect to this issue. This perception of influence on neighborhoods of hub cities is more suited to economic development aspects of cities than to meeting the social demands of cities, which implies an interconnectivity of social resources that is still poorly provided by most cities.   7 Conclusions When associating sustainable development goals with the studied variables, it allows inferring that there is evidence suggesting that neighborhoods are interacting (hub cities and neighborhoods). Thus, it can be noted, from the reclassification of regions of government (Table 1 ) into micro regions (Table 2 ), that larger cities have been a reference to smaller cities, but larger cities still have little influence on neighboring cities decisions, mainly regarding social aspects. The measurement of interconnectivity between cities or regions suggests (from the smallest contribution to that in which the flow of resources is strongly perceived) that the greater the development of a city is (associated with economic, educational, health and electricity use dimensions), the greater its interaction with neighboring cities becomes. The lower this ratio is, the lower the flow of resources with neighboring cities will be. Electricity consumption, particularly by industrial and commercial sectors and services, is the resource that allows other services (such as education, health, drinking water and sanitation) to be provided. Less privileged occurrences are closer to Serra do Mar or Serra da Mantiqueira, cities that make up micro regions M3  and M4 , whose economies traditionally require smaller amounts of electricity, mainly to supply commerce, service and residential sectors. Some variables such as HDI, when associated with economic variables, show less privileged cities as regards health, education and income conditions (associated with SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 11) which belong to micro regions M3  and M4 . Micro region M2 , represented by the MRPVNC cities by the sea (including Ilhabela, M3 ), are not under the same unfavorable conditions as those in cities found in the proximities of Serra do Mar (micro region M3 ), since M2  cities benefit from earnings from tourism services - especially in summer - and M3  cities (such as Paraibuna and São Luís do Paratitinga) are close to cultural tourism landmarks based on folklore and traditions. This fact reveals that geographic condition can positively interfere for a region to provide its citizens with good life conditions, thus not being forced to follow the characteristics of cities belonging to micro region M1  that has greater economic prominence in the MRPVNC. Proximity to hub cities means significant correlations with SDGs, i.e. the closer the city is to the hub city, the better the conditions of each variable concerning its own socioeconomic conditions become. An association with electricity use is also a significant factor, but it is not a the only determining factor for neighboring cities to meet their minimum needs without worsening the population vulnerability dimensions, especially regarding care for women, children and elderly individuals. A new classification suggested for micro regions (Table 2 ) was proved significant to explain the SDGs (mainly the first 12 SDGs suggested by the United Nations) for the MRPVNC, mainly by explaining the distances between cities by the Paraíba do Sul River banks and the neighboring cities around Serra da Mantiqueira and Serra do Mar.
