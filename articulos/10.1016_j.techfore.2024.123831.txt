                  2015 witnessed the introduction of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) by the United Nations (UN). Few studies have been conducted on emerging technologies for international entrepreneurship, how these technologies are developed across sectors, or how they can enhance the global sustainability of businesses to support the 2030 sustainable agenda. Therefore, his study investigates the impact of antecedents of international entrepreneurship on the SDGs through the mediating role of emerging technologies, with a precise focus on the moderating role of a global mindset. Data was collected through a cross-sectional approach from 484 entrepreneurs in China. Collected data were analyzed using PLS-SEM techniques on the statistical software SmartPLS 4. The study findings reveal that key antecedents of international entrepreneurship significantly influence the SDGs. Moreover, emerging technologies act as a significant mediator between international entrepreneurship antecedents and SDGs. Additionally, a global mindset among entrepreneurs is found to be a significant moderator between emerging technologies and SDGs. This study adds to the existing literature by presenting empirical evidence on the interconnections between international entrepreneurship, emerging technologies, and sustainable organizational development. The implications of this study offer valuable understandings for entrepreneurs aiming to enhance their organizations' sustainable development through innovative and entrepreneurial initiatives.

Few studies have been conducted on emerging technologies for international entrepreneurship, how these technologies are developed across sectors, or how they can enhance the global sustainability of businesses to support the 2030 sustainable agenda. Therefore, his study investigates the impact of antecedents of international entrepreneurship on the SDGs through the mediating role of emerging technologies, with a precise focus on the moderating role of a global mindset. Data was collected through a cross-sectional approach from 484 entrepreneurs in China. Collected data were analyzed using PLS-SEM techniques on the statistical software SmartPLS 4. The study findings reveal that key antecedents of international entrepreneurship significantly influence the SDGs. Moreover, emerging technologies act as a significant mediator between international entrepreneurship antecedents and SDGs. Additionally, a global mindset among entrepreneurs is found to be a significant moderator between emerging technologies and SDGs. This study adds to the existing literature by presenting empirical evidence on the interconnections between international entrepreneurship, emerging technologies, and sustainable organizational development. The implications of this study offer valuable understandings for entrepreneurs aiming to enhance their organizations' sustainable development through innovative and entrepreneurial initiatives.

There is no denying the world economy's vibrancy and international entrepreneurship (IE) are changing concurrently with its continued growth (Bahoo et al., 2023 ). In today's interconnected world, the pursuit of sustainable development goals (SDGs) is paramount for organizations striving to achieve long-term success. In 2015, the United Nations (UN) launched the 2030 agenda, which has delineated 17 SDGs, and 169 targets to be approved worldwide as tackling important worldwide issues such as environmental degradation, poverty, inequality, climate change, peace, and justice (Bonsu et al., 2020 ). To contribute effectively to these goals, organizations must harness the potential of international entrepreneurship, particularly through entrepreneurial orientation, international market capabilities, and entrepreneurial innovation. International entrepreneurship, once regarded as the domain of multinational corporations, now permeates every corner of the business landscape. It is no longer limited to conglomerates; even startups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are venturing into international markets at an unprecedented rate (Surana et al., 2020 ). Young business owners are becoming more aware of their obligation to support SDGs, acknowledging their vital role in addressing global challenges (Lopes et al., 2023 ). Entrepreneurial orientation encompasses an organization's proclivity towards risk-taking, proactiveness, and innovativeness, forming the bedrock for international expansion and market exploitation (Zhou et al., 2021 ). Market capabilities state to an organization's ability to understand, enter, and compete in global markets (Yi-Sheng and Tsuen-Ho, 2018 ). Entrepreneurial innovation drives the formation and execution of novel ideas, products, and processes that can propel organizations towards sustainable practices and competitive advantage (Del Giudice et al., 2019 ). Emerging technologies, such as AI, blockchain, fintech, and IoT offer extraordinary opportunities for organizations to innovate and boost their sustainability efforts (Wang et al., 2022 ). These technologies enable more efficient resource management, reduce environmental impact, and foster inclusive economic growth, aligning with SDGs such as industry, innovation, and infrastructure (Goal 9), responsible consumption and production (Goal 12), and climate action (Goal 13) (Coenen et al., 2022 ). A global mindset, characterized by an awareness of diverse cultures, markets, and practices, enables leaders to navigate the complexities of international business and leverage cross-border opportunities. This mindset is crucial for aligning entrepreneurial activities with the broader goals of sustainable development, guaranteeing that social and environmental well-being is not sacrificed in the pursuit of economic growth (Sharma and Virani, 2023 ). This dynamic environment, characterized by rapid technological advancements and increasing globalization, demands reevaluating traditional entrepreneurial strategies and capabilities (Alola and Adebayo, 2023 ; Zhou et al., 2021 ). COP28 aims to promote global action against climate change, emphasizing the importance of sustainability in all sectors, including business. The COP28 summit underscored the urgency of participating in sustainability at core of business processes and highlighted the critical role of innovation and technology in driving this transformation (Akpan and Olanrewaju, 2023 ). The ability to innovate is particularly vital in discussing the environmental and social challenges emphasized at COP28, as it drives the development of sustainable solutions and practices. COP28 and international entrepreneurship are interconnected through their mutual focus on sustainable development. Entrepreneurs can drive organizational goals that align with global sustainability targets, thereby contributing to the broader objective of combating climate change and encouraging sustainable development (Acen et al., 2024 ). Nowadays, emerging technologies such as AI, blockchain, fintech, and IoT have been a driving force behind much of the change experienced in recent years (Khurana and Dutta, 2021 ). Young entrepreneurs adopting these emerging technologies can increase productivity, develop cutting-edge goods and services, open new markets, and reduce adverse environmental effects (Adebayo et al., 2023a, 2023c ). Successful entrepreneurs use emerging technologies in their entrepreneurial ventures to compete globally (Boeker et al., 2021 ; Wu et al., 2024 ). This involves optimizing operations, automating routine tasks, and strategic decision-making. Moreover, a global mindset shapes how entrepreneurs operate internationally. Their capacity to use information, cultural sensitivity, and a wide-ranging global viewpoint can greatly impact how their international ventures relate to achieve the SDGs (Voola et al., 2022 ). Therefore, this research aims to delve deeply into this intricate and evolving landscape. It seeks to response to the overarching questions: First, how do the antecedents of international entrepreneurship influence SDGs through emerging technologies? Second, does a global mindset moderate the relationship among emerging technologies and SDGs? In an era characterized by rapid globalization and emerging technologies, the dynamics of international entrepreneurship have evolved significantly. Young entrepreneurs are increasingly leading in driving innovation and internationalization (Cervelló-Royo et al., 2022 ). However, the interaction between the antecedents of international entrepreneurship influence on the sustainable development of organizational goals using emerging technologies is an area that remains underexplored. Past studies (Bahoo et al., 2023 ; Fernhaber and Zou, 2022 ; Naderi et al., 2022 ) focused on the impact of digital technologies on sustainable entrepreneurship. Young entrepreneurs may have distinct needs, resources, and mindsets compared to more established entrepreneurs. In past studies (Ramsey et al., 2016 ; Sharma and Virani, 2023 ), no one has used mediators and moderators like emerging technologies and global mindsets to test the relationship between the antecedents of international entrepreneurship and SDGs. Identifying these mechanisms, this study fills the gap and investigates the relationship between international entrepreneurship antecedents and their influence on sustainable development goals using emerging technologies as a mediator. Furthermore, this study explores the moderator role of a global mindset between emerging technologies and sustainable development goals. Furthermore, Fig. 1   describes emerging technologies in international entrepreneurship.  2 Theoretical underpinning and hypotheses development 2.1 Theoretical support The resource-based view (RBV) theory can help explain how various resources and capabilities contribute to international entrepreneurship and the achievement of SDGs (He et al., 2020 ). A business's strategic stance characterized by inventiveness, proactivity, and risk-taking is known as its entrepreneurial orientation. From an RBV perspective, EO can be seen as a valuable intangible resource that enables firms to detect opportunities in transnational markets (Jalali et al., 2014 ). Market capabilities include market knowledge, international networking, and adapting products and services to different cultural contexts. According to RBV, these capabilities are crucial resources that provide a competitive edge in global markets (Solano Acosta et al., 2018 ). Entrepreneurial innovation entails developing and putting fresh concepts, goods, services, or procedures that add value into practice. Innovation is a critical resource in the RBV framework, as it can lead to sustainable competitive advantages when it is unique and difficult for participants to replicate (Ferreira et al., 2020 ). Global objectives identified as the SDGs are intended to tackle a range of social, economic, and environmental issues. From an RBV perspective, a firm's commitment to SDGs can be seen as a strategic resource that enhances its reputation and stakeholder relationships (ElAlfy et al., 2020 ). Emerging technologies can provide firms with new tools and capabilities to innovate, enter international markets, and achieve SDGs. In the RBV framework, emerging technologies are seen as dynamic resources that transform and enhance existing capabilities (Nayal et al., 2022 ). A global mindset refers to a firm's aptitude to perceive and interpret complex global dynamics and to integrate diverse perspectives into its strategic decisions. From the RBV perspective, a global mindset can be considered a higher-order resource that amplifies the value of other resources and capabilities (Ramsey et al., 2016 ). From above discussion, RBV theory helps to explain how international entrepreneurship antecedents EO, MC, and EIN, supported by emerging technologies and guided by a global mindset, can lead to significant contributions towards SDGS.  2.2 International entrepreneurship antecedents towards SDGS Sustainable development objectives and international entrepreneurship are two intricately linked fields that have recently attracting much attention (Avelar et al., 2024 ). Understanding the antecedents that contribute to international entrepreneurship's emergence and success in the context of SDGs involves examining various dimensions (Lopes et al., 2023 ). First, an entrepreneur's thinking and readiness to partake in entrepreneurial endeavors, such as innovation, risk-taking, and proactiveness, are referred to as entrepreneurial orientation. There are various ways in which this approach may impact sustainable development (Cervelló-Royo et al., 2022 ). Firms with a strong orientation are often more adjustable and innovative, which can lead to economic growth and profitability. The owners of entrepreneurial firms are willing to engage in social responsibility initiatives like community development or fair labor practices (Jiao et al., 2016 ). Second, international market capabilities are a firm's ability to navigate and compete effectively in global markets. Effective international market capabilities can increase revenue and market share, contributing to economic sustainability (Naderi et al., 2022 ). A global presence can encourage firms to adopt international environmental standards and adapt products to global environmental regulations (Surana et al., 2020 ). Last, entrepreneurial innovation involves developing and implementing new ideas, products, or processes. This can influence sustainability products and processes and determination of economic growth by generating new revenue streams and reducing costs (Zhao et al., 2024 ). Innovation can lead to more environmentally friendly products and processes, contributing to environmental sustainability (Adebayo et al., 2023b ; Kirikkaleli and Adebayo, 2021 ). Innovative firms may develop solutions that address social issues or improve the well-being of communities, supporting social sustainability (Glavas and Mathews, 2014 ). Economic goals can benefit from all three factors, as they can enhance revenue, profitability, and cost-effectiveness (Adebayo and Kirikkaleli, 2021 ). Market capabilities and entrepreneurial innovation can positively impact environmental goals, as they can drive the adoption of eco-friendly practices and technologies (Zabel and O'Brien, 2024 ).  2.3 Entrepreneurial orientation and emerging technologies Entrepreneurial individuals tend to be more innovative and creative. Entrepreneurs with an entrepreneurial orientation are often more adaptable to emerging technologies and open to change (Maiti and Ghosh, 2023 ). Entrepreneurial orientation encourages individuals to take calculated risks using emerging technologies. Young entrepreneurs are more eager to put in time and resources in unproven technologies, which can lead to breakthroughs and advancements in emerging fields (Zhou et al., 2021 ). A past study (Polas et al., 2022 ) emphasized that young entrepreneurs are likelier to stay reorganized on the latest technological progress and acquire the necessary skills. Entrepreneurship, especially in the technology sector, can contribute to economic growth by creating jobs, stimulating investment, and driving technological progress (Ho, 2023 ). Businesses that embrace an entrepreneurial mindset are more likely to leverage emerging technologies for innovation, proactively seize opportunities, take calculated risks, exercise autonomy, and assertively compete in the marketplace (Chaklader et al., 2023 ). The successful incorporation of emerging technologies within an international entrepreneurial framework can increase competitiveness, improve efficiency, and sustain growth. As emerging technologies continue to advance, their cooperation with entrepreneurial orientation will likely become even more integral to the success of businesses in the modern economy (Fernhaber and Zou, 2022 ). Based on the above discussion, we make following statement:H1a Entrepreneurial orientation positive impact on emerging technologies.    2.4 Market capabilities and emerging technologies Market capabilities and emerging technologies are closely intertwined in today's fast-paced business landscape (Yi-Sheng and Tsuen-Ho, 2018 ). Exploring how businesses leverage emerging technologies to enhance their market capabilities is essential. Market capabilities raise a company's ability to recognize and address the demands of the customer, familiarize itself to changing market surroundings, and gain a competitive advantage (Ekman et al., 2021 ). Emerging technologies encompass the latest innovations that have the possible to disrupt industries and drive business transformation. Emerging technologies such as AI, blockchain, fintech, and IoT enable businesses to analyze vast amounts of data for acumens into client behavior, market inclinations, and operational efficiency (Khan et al., 2023 ). This enhances individuals' ability to make data-driven choices and personalize products and services. IoT devices provide real-time data on products, assets, and customer interactions. Companies with strong market capabilities are better positioned to harness the potential of AI for innovation, efficiency, and competitive advantage (Gambardella and Giarratana, 2013 ). However, successful adoption requires addressing challenges, staying abreast of ethical considerations, and fostering a culture of continuous learning and adaptation (Nayak et al., 2021 ). Based on the above discussion, we have hypothesized the following statement:H1b Market capabilities' positive impact on emerging technologies.    2.5 Entrepreneurial innovation and emerging technologies Entrepreneurs are often the first to identify and invest in emerging technologies (Khurana and Dutta, 2021 ). By developing new applications and use cases for these technologies, they validate their market potential and drive demand, helping them gain acceptance and investment from a broader audience (Jiao et al., 2016 ; Xu et al., 2024 ). Entrepreneurial startups often collaborate with research institutions, corporations, and other organizations to push the boundaries of technological innovation. This generates economic growth, creates jobs, and fosters entrepreneurship ecosystems (Cohen et al., 2017 ). Entrepreneurial innovation fosters an environment where startups, investors, and academia collaborate to solve problems using emerging technologies. Countries that encourage entrepreneurial innovation in emerging technologies can enhance their global competitiveness. They attract investment, talent, and businesses, which helps them maintain technology leadership (Del Giudice et al., 2019 ). Entrepreneurial innovation is a driving force behind emerging technologies' development. It accelerates their adoption, creates economic opportunities, and addresses various societal challenges (Amini Sedeh et al., 2022 ). Entrepreneurs may benefit from collaborating with established technologies to improve startups. Building strategic partnerships can speed up the development and adoption of technological innovation (Boeker et al., 2021 ). Based on discussion, we have hypothesized the following statement:H1c Entrepreneurial innovation has a positive impact on emerging technologies.    2.6 Mediating role of emerging technologies Emerging technologies are developing at a rapid pace, which has drastically changed the entrepreneurial environment and created previously unobtainable chances for growth and innovation (Kruger and Steyn, 2020 ). Emerging technologies like AI, blockchain, fintech, and IoT are revolutionizing business operations, enhancing efficiencies, and creating new opportunities for innovation (Khan et al., 2023 ). AI offers advanced data analytics, predictive modeling, and automation capabilities that can significantly improve decision-making and operational efficiency (Polas et al., 2022 ). Blockchain provides a secure and transparent way to manage transactions and data, fostering trust and reducing the risk of fraud. Fintech innovations are transforming financial services, enabling faster, more accessible, cost-effective financial transactions (Chaklader et al., 2023 ). IoT allows for real-time data collection and analysis by connecting systems and devices, which enhances operational efficiency and innovation (Kumar et al., 2023 ). Entrepreneurs have the opportunity to drive positive change by incorporating emerging technologies that directly contribute to achieving the SDGs (Wang et al., 2022 ). This is particularly crucial for sustainable business owners, as they can utilize predictive analytics to make well-informed decisions about product development and marketing tactics (Kumar et al., 2023 ). Emerging technologies can assist in automating repetitive procedures, streamlining corporate processes, and increasing productivity (Boeker et al., 2021 ). Based arguments, we have hypothesized this statement:H2 Emerging technologies positively impact sustainable development goals.   Emerging technologies support a proactive entrepreneurial orientation by enabling rapid response to market opportunities and threats (Ho, 2023 ). AI, blockchain, fintech, and IoT drive innovation in products, services, and business models that align with SDGs, such as quality education, clean energy, and economic growth. These technologies enable the development of sustainable practices and solutions that discourse global challenges (Chaklader et al., 2023 ). Emerging technologies lower barriers to entry in international markets by providing digital platforms for global reach and collaboration. They enable entrepreneurs to scale their businesses internationally through efficient supply chain management, cross-border transactions, and global market analysis (Nayak et al., 2021 ). Emerging technologies like AI, blockchain, fintech, and IoT can also ensure transparency and accountability in entrepreneurial projects. Emerging technologies offer a wide range of opportunities for young entrepreneurs to drive sustainability in their ventures (Boeker et al., 2021 ). Therefore, Emerging technologies strengthen the relationships between international entrepreneurship and sustainable development goals. From discussion, we have hypothesized the subsequent statements:H3a Emerging technologies positively mediate the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and sustainable development goals.  H3b Emerging technologies positively mediate the association between market capabilities and sustainable development goals.  H3c Emerging technologies positively mediate the affiliation between entrepreneurial innovation and sustainable development goals.    2.7 Moderating role of global mindset Global mindset mentions to the capability of individuals or organizations to appreciate and understand cultural, political, and economic differences across countries (Jones and Wynn, 2021 ). It includes being open to and aware of diverse perspectives, practices, and opportunities worldwide (Avelar et al., 2024 ). Entrepreneurs with a global mindset are more adept at understanding and adapting emerging technologies to local contexts, ensuring that the solutions are culturally appropriate and widely accepted (Voola et al., 2022 ). Moving forward, solar energy solutions in rural areas should be introduced with consideration of local practices and energy needs (Adebayo, 2023 ). Individuals with a global mindset are better positioned to leverage international networks, partnerships, and collaborations (Mukhuty et al., 2022 ). This can accelerate the deployment of emerging technologies by facilitating knowledge transfer, accessing funding, and overcoming regulatory hurdles. For instance, international collaborations in healthcare technology can lead to faster development and distribution of medical innovations, contributing to good health and well-being (SDG 3) (Coenen et al., 2022 ). A global mindset raises openness to new ideas and continuous learning, crucial for staying ahead in the rapidly evolving landscape of emerging technologies (Veland et al., 2022 ). This attitude enables entrepreneurs to adopt and integrate new technologies to drive progress towards the SDGs. Understanding global risks and challenges allows entrepreneurs to anticipate better and mitigate potential setbacks when deploying new technologies (Azmat et al., 2023 ). This strategic foresight is essential for ensuring that technological solutions are sustainable and resilient, particularly in volatile international markets. Concurrently, the global community increasingly emphasizes the importance of SDGs to address pressing environmental, social, and economic challenges (Horne et al., 2020 ). Emerging technologies, such as AI, blockchain, fintech, and IoT, can revolutionize international entrepreneurship and contribute to achieving SDGs (Fukuda-Parr and Muchhala, 2020 ; Wang et al., 2022 ). These technologies allow young entrepreneurs to align their ventures with sustainable development objectives, from enhancing operational efficiency to creating new business models prioritizing environmental, social, and economic impact (Leonidou et al., 2024 ). Using above discussion, we have hypothesized the following statements:H4 Global mindset positively moderates the relationship between emerging technology and sustainable development goals.   Fig. 2   shows the theoretical framework.   3 Research methodology This study used a quantitative method. The problem statement's variables for the study were measured using numerical data, which were also employed to gather information from an extensive population. The quantitative survey investigated and examined the study's reliability, validity, and objectives. According to the researchers, a legitimate method for assessing the association between variables is using the quantitative research technique (Correia et al., 2024 ; Naderi et al., 2022 ). The proposed hypotheses were tested using a deductive approach and examined using the survey method. The survey's demographic questions were assessed using a five-point Likert scale, where “1” indicated strongly disagree and “5” indicated strongly agree. The questionnaires were distributed for self-administration, and respondents were asked to answer the questions. 3.1 Data collection and sample technique While emerging technologies can be observed in a variety of age groups; this study in particular targeted young entrepreneurs from China. Chinese online survey-sharing platform Sojump survey was used to collect the data, which is mostly used by researchers (Cao et al., 2021 ; Zhu et al., 2023 ). Non-probability convenience sampling was utilized to gather the necessary data. In convenience sampling, researchers select the most easily accessible subjects or individuals. This method was chosen for the study because reaching every member of the large population is difficult (Stratton, 2021 ). Participants in convenience sampling are selected based on their willingness and availability to participate. Online surveys often use convenience sampling because it is easy to contact respondents via email, social media, or other online platforms. Due to its accessibility to respondents and relevance to the assessment items, this technique can be overused despite generalizability issues. Therefore, the convenience sampling technique is not a major problem for the current investigation. The chosen group comprised young entrepreneurs who own small businesses across various cities in China. The primary data was gathered through a questionnaire distributed via online platforms. The data collection began with screening questions to assess the participants' aware with online applications and internet usage, as these were essential for the current or future use of emerging technologies to achieve sustainable development goals. This step ensured that only participants meeting the set criteria were included. This study employed a cross-sectional technique, distributing 650 questionnaires to entrepreneurs in the last quarter of 2023. A total of 484 replies were obtained, with a response rate of 74 %. 166 replies were disqualified for having incorrect or missing information. Due to the entrepreneurs' hectic schedules, the researchers had to complete the data-gathering process in several steps, and there is no unique list for business owners. The business owners mentioned in Zhenjiang, Changshu, Hebei, Tianjin, and Wuxi were contacted by the respondents in person, via email, and WeChat. The questionnaire was split into two sections: section one covered the demographic profiles of the respondents, while section two contained the items used to measure the variables. The chosen sample size adheres to guidelines from (Roscoe et al., 1975 ), which recommend including >30 but fewer than 500 participants in empirical studies. To better capture the spectrum of attitudes, a five-point Likert scale was utilized, offering respondents a broader range of options. To ensure strong participation, we distributed the survey via an in-person questionnaire targeting young entrepreneurs and through online platforms. An essential part of the research method is choosing the appropriate sample size. A small sample size may not be fully representative of the population or may even be the cause of the study's failure. Large sample sizes can present challenges for researchers in data collection and administration, increasing the time required and potentially detracting from the original intent of sampling (Kitsios and Kamariotou, 2021 ). Although the questionnaire was originally written in English, it was intended to be used in Chinese because that's China's official language. Thus, in order to assure consistency and facilitate respondent understanding, the researchers and professional native translators independently translated the English questionnaire into simplified and traditional Chinese (Shahzad et al., 2024b ). Additionally, the researchers tried to engage female entrepreneurs to participate in the study; some declined, but we received 35 % responses from females. As a result, this study has 65 % responses from male owners of businesses. Further demographics information is described in Table 1  .  3.2 Measures of constructs This study consists of six variables, i.e., emerging technologies, sustainable development, entrepreneurial orientation, market capabilities, entrepreneurial innovation, and global mindset. A Likert scale with five points—from “1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree”—is used to measure all variables of this study. Entrepreneurial orientation (EO) refers to the strategic mindset and organizational characteristics that encourage and enable a firm to identify and create opportunities and proactively engage in competitive markets. It was measured by six items taken from (Jin and Cho, 2018 ). Emerging technologies (ET) such as AI, blockchain, fintech, and IoT can position to entrepreneurs to take advantage of latest trends. It was measured by five items taken from (Dana et al., 2022 ). Market capabilities (MC) are critical for entrepreneurs seeking to expand their businesses beyond domestic borders. MC measured by five items taken from (Jin and Cho, 2018 ). Entrepreneurial innovation (ENI) creating and putting into practice novel ideas, products, services, or business strategies to add customer value, is recognized as entrepreneurial innovation. It was measured by five items taken from (Shahzad et al., 2021 ). A global mindset (GM) mentions cognitive, emotional, and behavioral attributes that allow individuals and organizations to operate effectively in a globalized world. GM was measured by four items taken from (Sharma and Virani, 2023 ). Finally, entrepreneurs engaged in international business have the potential to drive positive change by aligning their activities with the principles of sustainability and contributing to the achievement of the SDGs. It is driven by the desire to reach a triple bottom line: social, economic, and environmental sustainability. SDGs was measured by six items taken from (Del-Aguila-Arcentales et al., 2022 ).  3.3 Data analysis In this study, data from structural equation modeling (SEM) were analyzed using the partial least squares (PLS) method using SmartPLS-4 (Shahzad et al., 2024c ). The following benefits of the PLS-SEM approach are available for this model: PLS has more predictive power and almost no bias when used for predictive analysis in complicated models with smaller sample sizes (Hair et al., 2017 ). It is a helpful tool when assessing mediation-moderation models that operate simultaneously with multivariate and normal distributions. This work used the PLS-SEM for data analysis, screening, and assumption tracking. The current work evaluated the significant levels to determine construct loadings, path coefficients, and weights using PLS-SEM approaches. This study thoroughly examined these models using the highly specialized statistical tool SmartPLS 4.0. Unintentionally, PLS-SEM was chosen as the better analytical method for this investigation because of its wide use and track record of success in earlier research (Voorhees et al., 2016 ). SEM improves the consistency and effectiveness of statistical analysis, outperforming traditional statistical procedures and producing superior results.   4 Results 4.1 Common method bias To fully evaluate the potential for common method bias in this study, we used SPSS software to administer Harman's one-factor test. Modern research nevertheless supports this strategy because of its ease of use and effectiveness in evaluation, even with its acknowledged drawbacks (Howard and Henderson, 2023 ). In contrast to the traditional common technique bias criteria of 50 % (Podsakoff et al., 2003 ), as our study found that a single component contributed the variation, which was <50 %. These findings strongly suggest that common technique bias does not compromise the integrity of this study.  4.2 Measurement model To determine the suitability and precision of our measurement model, we used the PLS-SEM approach, which has been widely used in similar researches (Shahzad et al., 2021 ). Three essential components were evaluated: discriminant validity, convergent validity, and reliability. All three play a major role in the robustness of model and interpretations that follow (Hair et al., 2017 ). Table 2   lists the primary statistical guides for each of our measurement model's constructs, particularly Cronbach's alpha, CR, and AVE. An assessment criterion founded on Cronbach's alpha was employed for internal consistency. This metric, which was initially introduced by Lee Cronbach in 1951, evaluates the degree of relationship between the set of items through a construct (Bagozzi and Yi, 1989 ). Higher internal reliability is demonstrated by values above 0.7, whereas values closer to 1 show higher consistency among the items (Voorhees et al., 2016 ). Each variable surpassed this cutoff, as seen in Table 2 , demonstrating a high level of internal consistency. Composite reliability was used to complement the understanding acquired from Cronbach's alpha and overcome its drawbacks. Based on outer loading values, this metric assesses the variables' internal consistency (Shahzad et al., 2024a ). Similar to our findings, Cronbach's alpha, all construct CR values in Table 2  significantly exceeded the 0.7 thresholds. AVE was used to evaluate convergent validity, emphasizing how positively constructed items are connected. According to (Hair et al., 2017 ) criterion, convergent validity becomes appropriate when AVE values exceed 0.5. Strong convergent validity is indicated by the fact that all constructs fulfilled and frequently exceeded this requirement, as seen in Table 2 . Discriminant validity (DV) assesses how well a construct is distinct from others in a model, ensuring non-overlapping constructs and reinforcing the unique explanations provided for observed phenomena. To evaluate this, we employed the (Fornell and Larcker, 1981 ) criterion. Specifically, the square root of a construct's AVE (Average Variance Extracted) should surpass its highest correlation with any other construct to demonstrate strong discriminant validity. Table 3   presents these values in a matrix, where off-diagonal elements represent inter-construct correlations, and diagonal elements display the square root of AVE values. The diagonal values consistently exceed the off-diagonal correlations, indicating robust DV. Additionally, the author (Voorhees et al., 2016 ) proposed that a variable achieves DV if the HTMT (Heterotrait-Monotrait ratio) value is below 0.90, suggesting that all latent variables in our model possess valid discriminant validity.  4.3 Structural model To begin with, we utilize the measurement model and apply PLS-SEM to thoroughly assess the validity and reliability before progressing to the structural model. This model serves as an analytical framework to systematically explore the interactions among variables (Bagozzi and Yi, 1989 ). The structural model highlights various statistical indicators, including effect size (f 2 ), t-values, predictive relevance (Q 2 ), coefficient of determination (R 2 ), and path coefficients. Predictive relevance (Q 2 ) is assessed using the construct cross-validated redundancy method, which evaluates the model fit (Sarstedt et al., 2014 ). According to (Voorhees et al., 2016 ), latent exogenous values with significant predictive impact suggest that a (Q 2 ) value exceeding zero indicates model complexity. The (Q 2 ) result of 0.440 demonstrates the model's strong predictive capability and its contribution to achieving the SDGs for individual businesses. Typical (f 2 ) values are 0.04, 0.12, and 0.58, indicating small, medium, and large effects, respectively. The calculated (f 2 ) in this model ranges from moderate to large (Hair et al., 2017 ). Table 4   shows that all statistical techniques fall within the expected range. Additionally, (R 2 ) value indicates the proportion of variance in the latent variable explained by the model (Shahzad et al., 2021 ). Table 4  reveals that the model accounts for approximately 29 % of the variance in ET and 62 % in SDGs. The beta coefficient reported in the regression analysis was the same as the path coefficients in the PLS-SEM. The beta value reflected the degree of significance of the hypothesis and the expected variation in the endogenous variable caused by a unit change in an exogenous variable (Hair et al., 2017 ). The results are significant when the t-statistics are >1.96 and similarly p -values <0.05. PLS was used as the methodological instrument to test each of the aforementioned hypotheses. A bootstrapping process utilizing 5000 re-samples was carried out to accomplish this. The bootstrapping result indicates that all other hypothesized associations were supported (Correia et al., 2024 ). The direct effects of every variable in this study are displayed in Table 4 . H1a  demonstrated EO significant effect on ET (β = 0.292; t  = 6.555; p  < 0.000). Therefore, H1a  is accepted. H1b  showed a favorable impact of MC on ET (β = 0.164; t  = 3.036; p  < 0.003). Thus, H1b  is accepted. H1c  demonstrated EIN favorable effect on ET (β = 0.366; t  = 9.493; p < 0.000). Therefore, H1c  is accepted. H2  demonstrated ET positive impact on SDGs (β = 0.236; t  = 6.652; p < 0.000). Thus, H2  is accepted. Similarly going forward, a mediator helps to understand the link between two variables (Shahzad et al., 2024b ). For mediation analyses, ET significantly mediates the association between EO and SDGs, showing as (β = 0.069; t  = 4.571; p < 0.000). Therefore, H3a  is accepted. Similarly, ET significantly mediates the association between MC and SDGs, showing as (β = 0.039; t  = 3.001; p < 0.003). Therefore, H3b  is accepted. Furthermore, ET significantly mediates the association between EIN and SDGs with values (β = 0.086; t  = 4.833; p < 0.000). Therefore, H3c  is accepted. As per (Shahzad et al., 2024c ), the moderator can potentially influence (strengthen or weaken) the link between two variables. For moderation analyses, GM significantly moderates the relationship between ET and SDGs (β = 0.125; t  = 3.842; p < 0.000). Therefore, H4  is accepted. Fig. 3   also displays the results of the hypotheses. A basic slope analysis was performed using the PLS algorithm to investigate the impacts of moderation. Fig. 4   illustrates that GM favorably moderates the link between ET and SDGs. The findings indicate that the observed impact of moderation was strong enough to approach statistical significance. As a result of the statistical findings, it is possible to conclude that young entrepreneurs with high emerging technologies would achieve sustainable development goals under a high global mindset.   5 Discussion International entrepreneurship has become a pivotal force in the global business landscape, with organizations increasingly relying on emerging technologies to drive SDGs (Leonidou et al., 2024 ). Antecedents of international entrepreneurship involve identifying and exploiting opportunities outside domestic markets. This can support innovation, job creation, and economic growth, which are factors in the SDGs (Ekman et al., 2021 ). Emerging technologies, such as AI, blockchain, fintech, and IoT, guide entrepreneurs in terms of their surroundings and competition. Therefore, this study explores the relationship between the antecedents of international entrepreneurship and SDGs by mediating and moderating the roles of emerging technologies and global mindset. 484 entrepreneurs in China completed an online survey to assess the conceptual framework. The study presents three important research findings. First, the findings state that international entrepreneurship antecedents significantly influence sustainable development goals. This study states that entrepreneurial orientation, market capabilities, and international innovation enhance a firm's ability to contribute to sustainable development goals. As a result, the current study's H1a , H1b , and H1c  hypotheses are considered valid. A prior study (Zhou et al., 2021 ) stated that an organization's strategic orientation included entrepreneurial activities, such as risk-taking, proactiveness, and innovativeness, to achieve their SDGs. Companies with a strong entrepreneurial orientation are more likely to identify and capitalize on opportunities related to sustainable development (Ekman et al., 2021 ). Market capabilities relate to an organization's capacity to comprehend and react to market dynamics, which include customer needs, competition, and regulatory changes. A deep market understanding allows international entrepreneurs to identify sustainable trends and demands. International entrepreneurs can drive innovation in social, economic, and environmental initiatives (Zabel and O'Brien, 2024 ). Entrepreneurial innovation is crucial for addressing sustainability challenges. Entrepreneurs apply new concepts, ideas, goods, services, or procedures using entrepreneurial innovation strategies to obtain sustainable development goals (Del Giudice et al., 2019 ). Second, the findings of this study show that emerging technologies significantly mediate the relationship between international entrepreneurship antecedents and sustainable development goals. As an outcome, the current study's H2 , H3a , H3b , and H3c  hypotheses are accepted. Emerging technologies facilitate a deeper understanding of market trends, enabling businesses to develop proactive strategies (Chaklader et al., 2023 ). Massive databases are analyzed by emerging technologies to find trends, forecast changes in the market, and improve decision-making (Khan et al., 2023 ). Additionally, emerging technologies empower entrepreneurs to make data-driven decisions, aligning with the risk-taking nature of entrepreneurial orientation. Entrepreneurial innovation, a cornerstone of international entrepreneurship, involves creating and implementing novel ideas (Amini Sedeh et al., 2022 ). Emerging technologies such as AI, blockchain, fintech, and IoT stimulate creativity by automating routine tasks and freeing human resources for more creative endeavors (Ho, 2023 ). The predictive capabilities of emerging technologies also play a crucial role in identifying potential areas for sustainable investment and innovation (Khurana and Dutta, 2021 ). By analyzing global trends and emerging opportunities, entrepreneurs can align their initiatives with sustainable development goals, contributing to social and economic well-being on a global scale (Naderi et al., 2022 ). Third, the findings of this study reveal that a global mindset significantly moderates the relationship between emerging technologies and sustainable development goals. As a result, the H4  hypothesis of the current study has been accepted. With their data analysis, pattern recognition, and automation capabilities, emerging technologies can potentially drive innovative solutions for sustainable development (Chaklader et al., 2023 ). By anticipating environmental changes and optimizing resource use, emerging technologies can significantly play a role in achieving the SDGs. Global knowledge is essential for ensuring that the use of emerging technologies in development considers the global consequences of sustainable development and stays away from decisions that could favor one area at the expense of another (Jones and Wynn, 2021 ). Past study findings encouraged a global mindset role in decision-making involving diverse voices from various locations (Mukhuty et al., 2022 ). Emerging technologies offer unprecedented opportunities to tackle environmental, social, and economic issues. These innovations, from precision agriculture to smart cities, can enhance efficiency, reduce resource consumption, and foster inclusivity to achieve sustainable development goals (Adebayo, 2022 ; Adebayo and Alola, 2023 ). 5.1 Study implications This study has some implications contribute to academic discourse and offer actionable insights for policymakers, educators, and young entrepreneurs seeking to thrive in the dynamic landscape of international entrepreneurship. This study sheds light on the role of emerging technologies in facilitating international entrepreneurship. This could lead to developing a theoretical framework that illustrates the mechanisms through which technologies, such as AI, blockchain, fintech, and IoT accelerate international expansion for young entrepreneurs. Understanding the influence of a worldwide viewpoint on global entrepreneurship, particularly in a culturally diverse nation such as China, aids in the creation of theories that incorporate cultural intelligence and global consciousness into current entrepreneurial frameworks. Encourage partnerships between local and international organizations to foster knowledge exchange and market expansion. Promote infrastructure investments in the technology sector to guarantee consistent and public access to cutting-edge technologies, encouraging young entrepreneurs' creativity and expansion. Encourage the development of incubators and technology parks to provide a conducive environment for startups working on cutting-edge technologies. This study's findings can advise policymakers and institutions about young entrepreneurs' needs and challenges in China. This may result in the creation of focused funding programs, support networks, and legislation to promote global entrepreneurship. Practical insights from the study can be incorporated into entrepreneurship education programs. Training programs can be created to give aspiring business owners the know-how they need to successfully navigate global marketplaces, incorporate cutting-edge technology, and develop a global perspective. Furthermore, global mindset development and the strategic use of emerging technologies can guide decision-making in international business expansion. The study's emphasis on sustainable development aligns with the growing importance of emerging technologies. Incorporating sustainable practices into their worldwide business plans can help young entrepreneurs build their reputations while also improving the well-being of society and the environment. This study advocates for policies that encourage the integration of emerging technologies such as AI, blockchain, fintech, and IoT in entrepreneurial ventures to enhance efficiency and competitiveness. This study encourages the creation of educational initiatives that help young entrepreneurs develop a global mindset so they are ready for ventures into international businesses. Establish partnerships between educational institutions and industry players to facilitate knowledge transfer on emerging technologies and global business practices. Owners of businesses create training programs to improve the abilities of prospective entrepreneurs in leveraging emerging technologies for sustainable development goals. Encourage government initiatives that provide financial support, grants, and incentives for young entrepreneurs engaging in international business activities focusing on sustainable development. Establish support mechanisms for technology transfer and adoption, fostering collaboration between startups and established businesses. Promote networking events, conferences, and forums that facilitate collaboration between young entrepreneurs, established businesses, and experts in emerging technologies.  5.2 Limitations and future directions There are a few limitations to this research that require further research. First, the findings of this study are applicable as they are focused on the context of China and young entrepreneurs. The cultural, economic, and political factors in China may differ significantly from other regions, limiting the generalizability of the results. For future studies, researchers should focus on different regions and countries' contexts. Second, this study considered a relatively small sample size or a specific demographic of young entrepreneurs in China, making it challenging to generalize the results to a broader population. Future researchers might consider the diverse landscape of Chinese entrepreneurs. Third, this research design is cross-sectional; it may only capture a snapshot of the relationship between international entrepreneurship, emerging technologies, global mindset, and SDGs. For a future perspective, a longitudinal study would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamic nature of these factors over time. Fourth, this study uses emerging technologies as rapidly evolving as new technologies, such as artificial intelligence. Our study findings apply emerging technologies like AI, blockchain, fintech, and IoT that could enhance international entrepreneurship and sustainable development. For future studies, the researcher will focus on big data, e-commerce platforms, and renewable energy technologies in entrepreneurial ventures to explore the results' more generalizability. Last, this study focuses only on Chinese entrepreneurs; from a future perspective, conducting a comparative analysis across different countries or regions would help to understand the variations in the international entrepreneurship antecedents and their impact on sustainable development. This would contribute to a more comprehensive global understanding.   6 Conclusion The research study has a three-fold contribution. First, international entrepreneurship antecedents significantly influence sustainable development goals as H1a , H1b , and H1c  are accepted. Second, emerging technologies significantly mediate the association among international entrepreneurship antecedents and sustainable development goals, as H2 , H3a , H3b , and H3c  are valid. Third, that global mindset significantly moderates the relationship between emerging technologies and sustainable development goals as H4  is supported. From a social change perspective, the integration of these elements drives significant progress towards the SDGs by promoting economic inclusivity, environmental stewardship, and social equity. Empowering by a global mindset and leveraging emerging technologies, entrepreneurial firms can act as catalysts for sustainable development. They create jobs, foster innovation, and improve living standards while ensuring that their operations do not harm the planet or society. By creating new markets and opportunities, international entrepreneurs can lift communities out of poverty (SDG 1: No poverty) and ensure that economic growth benefits all segments of society, particularly the marginalized and underserved. Entrepreneurial innovations and emerging technologies can significantly reduce carbon footprints, waste, and resource usage, thereby protecting natural ecosystems and biodiversity (SDG 15: life on land and SDG 14: life below water). A global mindset promotes diversity and inclusion, ensuring business practices respect and promote human rights and cultural diversity. This alignment with SDG 5 (gender equality) and SDG 10 (reduced inequality) ensures that the benefits of entrepreneurship are shared equitably.
