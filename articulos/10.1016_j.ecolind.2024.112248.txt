                  The adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by the United Nations General Assembly, encompassing 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), established a universal framework for addressing global challenges. Within the European Union (EU), the commitment to these goals has prompted the integration of the SDGs into a strategic framework for sustainable and inclusive growth. Recognizing the need for localized and detailed monitoring to capture the nuanced progress and challenges across Europe’s diverse regions, this paper proposes a comprehensive set of regional indicators specifically designed for the European context. Through a systematic review of existing SDG monitoring frameworks at different territorial levels and an extensive methodological process, the paper identifies 116 indicators that address 75 SDG targets. This tailored set is derived from a combination of national, regional, and supranational sources. The paper discusses the critical balance between standardization for comparability and customization to accommodate unique regional characteristics. The proposed indicator set is evaluated for its capacity to reflect the holistic vision of the SDGs while allowing for effective regional benchmarking. The research emphasizes the need for robust regional data infrastructure, the importance of aligning policies with broader sustainability objectives, and the dynamic nature of indicators that can adapt to societal changes such as demographic shifts. Finally, the paper highlights the significance of a pragmatic and adaptive regional approach to SDG monitoring. The proposed indicator set is a strategic tool for policymakers, stakeholders, and practitioners, guiding Europe’s regions towards a sustainable future and contributing to the global effort to achieve the SDGs by 2030.

The adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by the United Nations General Assembly, encompassing 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), established a universal framework for addressing global challenges. Within the European Union (EU), the commitment to these goals has prompted the integration of the SDGs into a strategic framework for sustainable and inclusive growth. Recognizing the need for localized and detailed monitoring to capture the nuanced progress and challenges across Europe’s diverse regions, this paper proposes a comprehensive set of regional indicators specifically designed for the European context. Through a systematic review of existing SDG monitoring frameworks at different territorial levels and an extensive methodological process, the paper identifies 116 indicators that address 75 SDG targets. This tailored set is derived from a combination of national, regional, and supranational sources. The paper discusses the critical balance between standardization for comparability and customization to accommodate unique regional characteristics. The proposed indicator set is evaluated for its capacity to reflect the holistic vision of the SDGs while allowing for effective regional benchmarking. The research emphasizes the need for robust regional data infrastructure, the importance of aligning policies with broader sustainability objectives, and the dynamic nature of indicators that can adapt to societal changes such as demographic shifts. Finally, the paper highlights the significance of a pragmatic and adaptive regional approach to SDG monitoring. The proposed indicator set is a strategic tool for policymakers, stakeholders, and practitioners, guiding Europe’s regions towards a sustainable future and contributing to the global effort to achieve the SDGs by 2030.

This agenda incorporates 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030. These interconnected goals tackle global challenges, including poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, peace, and justice, underscoring the need for immediate and sustained action at all levels of governance and society. The SDGs within the European Union (EU) have been integrated into a strategic framework for sustainable and inclusive growth. The EU's institutions, including the European Commission (EC), European Parliament (EP), and the Council of the EU, collaborate to set the EU's agenda and initiate and adopt laws contributing to the SDGs. The EC proposes new legislation, while the EP and the Council promote SDG implementation in EU policies through resolutions, conclusions, and legislative acts. Notably, the EC has aligned its policies with the 2030 Agenda's objectives, reflecting the EU's internal and global commitment to sustainable development. Key initiatives such as the European Green Deal aim to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050, aligning with SDGs related to climate action, energy, and sustainable communities. In July 2023, the EU presented its latest Voluntary Review at the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF), highlighting progress and areas for improvement in SDG implementation (European Commission, 2023 ). However, a more detailed approach to monitoring is needed to capture the nuanced progress and challenges across the EU's diverse territories (UCLG, 2019; Ortiz-Moya & Reggiani, 2023 ). Subnational monitoring is essential to identify disparities, address regional inequalities, and ensure that no one is left behind (UN-Habitat, 2015; Jones & Comfort, 2020 ). This granularity enables the development of region-specific interventions sensitive to each area's unique socio-economic and environmental contexts (Bell & Morse, 2018 ). Nevertheless, a comprehensive regional SDG monitoring framework in Europe still needs to be discovered.1  1 The concept of "region" used here refers to the Eurostat definition (Eurostat, 2018 ).   While EUROSTAT has proposed a set of 21 indicators for assessing regional SDG performance, this set only partially covers all SDGs or the breadth of their associated targets.2  2 Retrieved April 2024 from https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/sdi/database .   A more expansive and inclusive set of indicators is crucial for a holistic picture of regional progress. This paper aims to bridge this gap by proposing a pathway towards a comprehensive regional SDG indicator system, which could provide essential insights for targeted policy-making and interventions. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2  reviews pertinent scientific and grey literature on SDG monitoring frameworks at different territorial levels. Section 3  describes the methodological approach for developing a set of indicators for monitoring the SDGs in European regions. Section 4 and 5  introduce and critically discuss the proposed regional indicators. Section 6 concludes with reflections on how these indicators may inform European sustainable development practices.  2 Monitoring sustainable Development: Frameworks, Customisation, and indicator selection 2.1 The dynamics of global and regional SDG monitoring frameworks In pursuing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), effective monitoring and evaluation frameworks are pivotal in gauging progress, informing policy, and guiding action. The literature on SDG monitoring frameworks is expansive, reflecting sustainable development's complexity and multifaceted nature (Grainger-Brown & Malekpour, 2019; Diaz‐Sarachaga et al., 2018; Horvath et al., 2022 ). This work provides a crucial foundation for understanding how institutions, from the United Nations to regional bodies, track advancements toward these ambitious objectives. However, translating institutional recommendations into practical application is often characterised by a dynamic tension between adherence to standardised indicators and customising metrics to suit local contexts (Burford et al., 2013; Heinze et al., 2016 ). The institutional frameworks for monitoring SDGs, often developed by international organisations and national governments, aim to offer a coherent and unified approach to measurement. These frameworks are designed to provide a common language and set of benchmarks that can be used across different scales of governance to enable comparison, aggregate data, and facilitate the sharing of best practices. However, the literature reveals that strict adherence to institutional frameworks is uncommon. Instead, national, regional, and urban authorities often adapt or develop indicators to reflect their unique circumstances, priorities, and challenges (Eakin et al., 2011; UN-Habitat, 2022; Hidalgo, 2021 ). This divergence is not merely a matter of preference. However, it is also a response to the need to make the SDG monitoring process relevant and actionable locally, where the impact of policies and initiatives is most directly felt (Bertozzi et al., 2021 ). The ongoing debate between standardisation and customisation of SDG monitoring sets is a central theme in the literature (Ciambra et al., 2023 ). On the one hand, standardisation advocates for a consistent methodology that ensures comparability and coherence across different regions and levels of analysis (Martinez, 2022 ). On the other hand, customisation emphasises tailoring indicators to local realities to capture sustainable development's nuanced and diverse experiences (Herrera, 2019 ). This debate has yet to be resolved, with scholars and practitioners contributing arguments and evidence favouring both approaches (Arya et al., 2005; Tharani, 2019; Abrahamsson & Isaksson, 2012 ). The literature suggests that a balance might be necessary, one that upholds the benefits of standardisation while allowing for the contextualisation required to make the SDG monitoring frameworks truly effective and reflective of regional and local needs. Our proposal combines both approaches, offering a single set of indicators (standardisation) that can be selectively applied to reflect regional and local realities (customisation). As regions adopt the most relevant and feasible indicators for their context, the data collection process remains meaningful and manageable. The relationships between indicators and SDGs may vary across regions and evolve, reflecting the unique trade-offs and synergies that emerge from spatial and governance factors. Thus, while the set of indicators remains consistent, their application and interpretation can differ according to each region's specific needs and circumstances. By embracing this combination of standardisation and customisation, we aim to provide essential insights for targeted policy-making and foster a more nuanced understanding of sustainable development across Europe's diverse regions.  2.2 Selecting indicators for regional SDG monitoring Since the launch of the SDGs in 2015, selecting appropriate indicators for monitoring has been a critical priority. Various studies have addressed the importance of this selection process and proposed criteria for doing so. However, not all studies have taken the next step of making specific indicator selections. For instance, Hák et al. (2016)  emphasise the need for indicator selection and propose criteria based on the indicator-indicated fact relation to ensure relevance. However, they do not provide specific indicators for SDG monitoring. More recently, based on a systematic literature review, Gebara et al. (2024)  propose a framework for indicator selection that incorporates both the evaluation of individual indicators and the assessment of the overall indicator set. Both steps are crucial within their selection framework. Using this framework, they evaluate existing sets of indicators for different levels of sustainability analysis (global, national, and corporate). This method is valuable as it provides a comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of established indicator sets, allowing for refinement and improvement of the monitoring set by identifying gaps or redundancies. It is also worth mentioning that many of the papers that analyse criteria for indicator selection do so by focusing the analysis on a specific sector (see, for example, Valenzuela-Venegas et al. (2016)  for industrial parks; Bonisoli et al. (2018)  for the agri-food sector; Pires et al. (2020)  for the water sector). However, the criteria they put forward can be applied to selecting indicators in other areas of analysis. Relevance is the most cited criterion in these indicator selection processes. The significance of relevance in indicator selection lies in its ability to reflect progress accurately and meaningfully towards the established goals. However, operational reality often imposes limitations, and data availability becomes a determining factor. Overall, it has been observed that when it comes to producing indicators, most of the focus in academic, institutional, and SDG practitioners’ literature is on the criteria related to their production. However, there seems to be a lack of attention given to the criteria that are designed to support the use and effectiveness of these indicators. Some researchers, like Barbier & Burgess (2019, 2021) , have selected specific indicators. Their work contributes to the practical aspects of monitoring progress toward SDGs by offering concrete indicators for consideration and providing insights on assessing trends, trade-offs, and synergies in achieving the different SDGs. However, they select only one indicator per SDG without a precise justification for this limitation in number. Other studies build upon the indicator proposal by the United Nations comprising 231 indicators (UN, 2018 ) and analyse the operational scope of this indicator framework. In this regard, Dang and Serajuddin (2020)  highlight the scarcity of available data for most of these indicators across countries and over time. They also underscore the challenges associated with interpreting a diverse array of indicators aimed at monitoring goals and targets of varying nature. Nilsson et al. (2016)  rightly point out that countries or regions must interpret the SDGs and their interrelationships according to their national or regional circumstances and levels of development, as interactions will vary from country to country or from region to region. Differences in geography, governance, and technology, among other factors, suggest caution when relying on generalised knowledge for progress in achieving the SDGs in a given region. Similarly, Bali Swain and Ranganathan (2021)  analysed different regions and showed that universal benchmarking of the SDGs can be counterproductive. While national governments are responsible for executing the SDGs, the actual implementation occurs within local communities, businesses, and citizens across the country (Alcamo et al., 2021 ). Monitoring the SDGs at the regional-local level is crucial to ensure that no one is left behind on the path that the United Nations charts toward sustainability, as represented in the SDGs. In addition, the need for more reliable data can hinder the effective measurement of progress, underscoring the need to address existing data collection and availability gaps. Shuai et al. (2021)  highlight the additional challenge of the necessary resource investment for the periodic monitoring of SDG indicators. A significant investment of institutional and financial resources is needed to monitor the indicators of the SDGs periodically. According to Open Data Watch's estimates, the total cost for collecting data to measure Tier I and II SDG indicators in low- and medium-income countries until 2030 amounts to nearly $45 billion, a figure exceeding the United Nations' annual budget in 2016, as reported by the UN System (Open Data Watch, 2016 ). This involves financial resources and the commitment of institutional resources to ensure the continuity and quality of monitoring. A sufficient investment may result in a lack of updating and periodic review of indicators, compromising the effectiveness of the monitoring process. Ongoing efforts in the field involve the continuous review and update of indicators to ensure their relevance and effectiveness in reflecting progress towards sustainable development. Policymakers, researchers, and practitioners collaborate to refine and adapt indicator sets to evolving global challenges, fostering a dynamic and responsive monitoring framework for sustainable development. This challenge can be even more significant when we try to obtain data at the regional-local level. As mentioned before, the most significant monitoring and tracking efforts have been carried out globally without considering the idiosyncrasies of each region, where the policies that aid in achieving the SDGs are indeed implemented. Therefore, while relevance remains an essential criterion in indicator selection, it is crucial to address practical and financial limitations that may arise in the implementation process. The reconciliation between the aspiration for highly relevant indicators and operational feasibility regarding data availability and updating is essential to achieve an effective and up-to-date SDG monitoring system.  2.3 The European Union's practices in SDG monitoring Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, plays a pivotal role in assessing the progress of EU member states towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It accomplishes this by compiling a detailed statistical overview that reflects the current situation, based on the most recent data, and the trajectory of advancement towards the 17 SDGs. Eurostat's efforts are visualised using the EU SDG indicator set through an interactive tool known as the SDG country overview, which presents graphical representations of each member state's progress (Eurostat, 2023 ). These visualisations are also integral to the EU SDG monitoring report and are incorporated into the European Semester country reports. In alignment with the Commission's commitment to operationalising the SDGs through concrete actions, Eurostat conducts regular monitoring and coordinates developing and updating the EU SDG indicator set. The production of annual monitoring reports, with the 2023 edition marking the seventh publication, offers a statistical assessment of the EU's short-term and, when data permits, long-term trends over the past 15 years about the SDGs (Eurostat, 2023 ). The progress of these indicators, particularly the 22 tied to quantitative EU targets, is meticulously evaluated against established benchmarks. These targets span various domains such as the environment, agriculture, energy, education, poverty, and employment. For indicators without explicit EU targets, their progress is assessed based on the direction and pace of change. The EU SDG indicator set is comprehensive at the national level, encompassing 100 indicators structured to align with the 17 SDGs. Annually reviewed, the set evolves to integrate new data sources and address EU priorities, such as those under the European Green Deal initiative. While most SDGs are associated with six specific indicators, 33 out of 100 are multipurpose, monitoring more than one SDG and emphasising the interconnectedness between different goals. For regional monitoring, the indicator set is more concise, with 21 indicators covering 10 of the 17 SDGs. This regional set underscores the need to adapt monitoring practices to reflect the unique challenges and priorities at the subnational level, a theme central to the focus of this paper. At the urban level, the EC JRC has published two editions (the latest one in 2022) of its European Handbook for SDG Voluntary Local Reviews (VLRs) (Siragusa et al., 2022 ). The Handbooks provide an essential guide for local governments in Europe to monitor SDG achievements at the urban level and offer an updated set of 72 indicators from various sources, including international and European institutions and local governments and research bodies. These indicators, encompassing official and experimental data, enable cities to track progress toward the SDGs. Despite comprehensive efforts to propose monitoring sets at the national (primarily) and urban levels, the monitoring of SDGs at the regional level remains relatively underdeveloped. This gap in regional monitoring results from insufficient efforts from institutions and practitioners. However, it is crucial to highlight the role of EU national statistical institutes (NSIs) in this context. NSIs collect and process sub-national data, which is essential for accurate and detailed SDG monitoring. The capacities and practices of various national statistical offices differ significantly, impacting the quality and availability of sub-national data (MacFeely & Barnat, 2017 ). Resource constraints, varying technical capabilities, and differing methodologies can hinder sub-national data collection and reporting uniformity. Our work addresses the lack of a regional specific monitoring set by emphasising the unique challenges and priorities at the subnational level, ultimately contributing to a more holistic understanding of SDG progress across all government levels.  2.4 Global perspectives on SDG monitoring At the global level, the United Nations has established a comprehensive monitoring framework to track progress towards the SDGs. This framework is anchored by an extensive list of indicators, specifically 248, covering all 17 goals adopted by the UN Statistical Commission, with 13 indicators repeated under two or more different SDG targets. These indicators serve as the foundation for global monitoring and are intended to be universally applicable across all nations. While the framework is global in scope, it also allows for flexibility, encouraging countries to adapt the indicators to their national contexts and priorities. This inclusive approach ensures that all countries, regardless of their development stage, can contribute to and benefit from the global momentum towards sustainable development. The UN's monitoring efforts also emphasise the importance of disaggregated data to address inequalities and ensure no one is left behind. The indicators are periodically reviewed and updated to incorporate emerging issues and to reflect the dynamic nature of development challenges. This global framework, therefore, not only guides international efforts but also influences national and regional practices, offering a benchmark against which all other SDG monitoring frameworks are measured. According to the UN resolution, the global indicator framework is to be complemented by indicators at the regional and national levels developed by Member States, with efforts so far in this direction being relatively limited. Since a very large number of indicators would be required to comprehensively track progress towards all aspects of the 169 targets, at each level of monitoring, the SDSN recommend 10 criteria3  3 1. Limited in number and globally harmonized 2. Simple, single-variable indicators, with straightforward policy implications 3. Allow for high frequency monitoring 4. Consensus based, in line with international standards and system-based information 5. Constructed from well-established data sources 6. Disaggregated 7. Universal 8. Mainly outcome-focused 9. Science-based and forward-looking 10. A proxy for broader issues or conditions (SDSN, 2015 ).   for robust Global Monitoring Indicators (according to the UN Report Indicators and a Monitoring Framework for the Sustainable Development Goals, 2015): indicators should be limited in number and globally harmonized, all SDG indicators need to be considered as an integrated package and must work in harmony with one another; they should be simple, intuitive, easy to interpret and communicate, they must also have clear policy implications. In addition, they should be consensus-based, in line with international standards; relevant to all countries and all people; and able to be disaggregated to track progress for all relevant groups (SDSN, 2015 ). Beyond the UN establishments, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has also shaped SDG monitoring practices. The OECD provides a unique platform for comparing policy experiences, seeking answers to common problems, and coordinating domestic and international policies among its member countries. To support the 2030 Agenda, the OECD has developed a tool for measuring the distance to the SDGs in OECD regions and cities, which includes a wide selection of indicators aligned with the UN global indicator framework but customised to the economic, social, and environmental contexts specific to the OECD member countries (OECD, 2022 ). This tool aims to facilitate the integration of the SDGs into member countries' national planning and budgeting processes, highlighting the importance of policy coherence for sustainable development. At the regional level, building on its longstanding work on territorial indicators, the OECD has gathered 135 indicators to monitor progress in regions and cities towards the SDGs in OECD countries (OECD, 2020 ). Additionally, other regions and international organisations have adopted various approaches to monitoring SDGs. For instance, the African Union has established the Africa SDG Index and Dashboards in collaboration with the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) to track progress on the continent (SDSN, 2015 ). Similarly, regional commissions and development banks in Asia and Latin America have initiated SDG tracking mechanisms that cater to their regional specificities and development agendas (Asian Development Bank, 2020 ). These regional and international efforts underscore the global commitment to the SDGs and the necessity of tailoring monitoring frameworks to fit diverse economic, social, and environmental landscapes. Each framework contributes to the collective understanding of progress and challenges, enriching the global discourse on sustainable development and informing policy at all levels. In light of the diverse monitoring frameworks established by various international organizations, it is crucial to maintain a unified and collaborative approach to ensure that these frameworks contribute to a collective understanding of progress and challenges in sustainable development. This can be achieved, among other things, through harmonization and alignment with the UN global indicator framework, promoting data transparency and quality, fostering collaboration and communication, encouraging capacity building and training, and emphasizing policy coherence and integration.   3 Materials and methods for developing a regional SDG indicator set 3.1 Study context The indicator set is extracted from the input of 10 European regions as part of the REGIONS2030 project, representing a diverse range of Western, Central, and Southern Europe as depicted in Fig. 1  . These regions include Nord-Vest (Romania), Pomorskie (Poland), North Aegean (Greece), Western Macedonia (Greece), Navarre (Spain), Andalucia (Spain), Piemonte (Italy), Apulia (Italy), Centro (Portugal), and TR33 (Turkey). These regions offer a variety of socio-economic conditions and environmental settings, including coastal areas, mountainous terrains, and inland plains. They face common challenges such as climate change, water and air quality issues, demographic changes, and biodiversity loss. Most of the pilot regions, a total of eight, are in Southern Europe. The TR33 region is in the Northern Aegean part of Turkey, while the North Aegean region comprises sparsely populated Greek islands. Western Macedonia, another Greek region, is known for its energy production and is located on the border. Piemonte, in the North-West of Italy, is a mountain region centred around Torino, while Apulia, in the South-East, is a populated coastal region. Navarre has a strong economy in Spain, and Andalucia relies heavily on services and tourism. The Centro Region in Portugal is known for its agricultural output and renewable energy production. The remaining pilot regions, Pomorskie in Poland and Nord-Vest in Romania, are in Central Eastern Europe. Its agricultural and tourism sectors characterize Pomorskie, while Nord-Vest mainly focuses on agriculture. This comprehensive study coverage allows for a multidimensional analysis of regional disparities and an assessment of progress towards the SDGs, considering each area's unique geographic and socio-economic characteristics (Abreu, 2023; Armenise, 2023; Koutsomarkos, 2023; Lella, 2023; Mrozowska, 2023; Osés-Eraso, 2023; Pop, 2023; Quintanilla Cabañero, 2023; Strogylopoulos, 2023; Türker, 2023 ).  3.2 Methodological approach The indicator selection methodology focuses on a comparative analysis of regions within the study context. The process is divided into four distinct steps. The criteria used in each step, the sources used and the analyses performed are summarised in Fig. 2  . Step 1: Establishing an initial indicator set. The initial step involved constructing a preliminary set of indicators suitable for empirical validation across various regions. This process began with identifying multiple data sources, prioritizing those that offer open access online. Key sources included the Eurostat Regional Statistics Database, the Urban Data Platform Plus, and the OECD Regional Database. Additionally, several case studies were selected for inclusion. Initially, 629 regional indicators were pinpointed. Through a process of filtering and consolidating duplicate indicators, this number was reduced to 302. Subsequent refinement was guided by alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as well as considerations of geographical scope, temporal span, and update frequency, ultimately narrowing the set further. The geographic scope is a pertinent criterion, as indicators need to be calculable within subnational territorial units. Similarly, temporal scope is a critical criterion because data over time facilitates a more comprehensive analysis of progress towards sustainability compared to a single data point. Related to this, calculation frequency is essential, as ongoing information is required to provide timely and appropriate signals to decision-makers, enabling responses to changing trends as needed. A significant aspect of the reduction process was the consultative engagement with DG REGIO (Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy, European Commission) and ESTAT (Eurostat, European Commission) (for more information on the consultation process see Vega-Rapun et al, 2022 ). Following these criteria and analyses, the refined set of indicators was established, comprising 83 indicators that span all 17 SDGs and address 54 specific SDG targets. Step 2: Empirical assessment across diverse regions. The proposed indicators are empirically assessed through their application in monitoring 10 European regions. Indicators are evaluated primarily for relevance; they must be salient and informative for the SDG target within the specific regional context. This criterion aligns with the relevance definitions of Hák et al., (2012,2016)  and Gebara et al. (2024) , encompassing the indicator's representativeness for the sustainability theme and its policy relevance. A secondary criterion is the availability of regional data sourced from traditional providers such as international organizations and national statistics offices and non-traditional sources like spatial data infrastructure and sensor networks (Fritz et al., 2019 ). Data source selection influences data reliability and comparability across regions. Each region's analysis also examines whether the proposed set comprehensively covers SDG aspects relevant to the region. This step identifies relevant targets lacking a proposed indicator, targets with misaligned indicators, and goals with appropriate indicators but unavailable data. New indicators are proposed where gaps or misalignments are found. Trend analysis is emphasized, recognizing that dynamic data can reveal different insights than a static snapshot, as noted by Dang and Serajuddin (2020) . Step 3: Comparative analysis across regions. Following individual regional analyses, the next phase involves comparative scrutiny to identify consistencies and disparities in the relevance of the initial 83 indicators, data accessibility, and source evaluation across regions. A comparison of the analyses conducted by the 10 regions shows that for 70 of the 83 indicators there is a high level of agreement among the regions: they agree fairly well on the relevance of these indicators, with respect to their alignment with an SDG target and the accessibility of data. However, for 13 of the 83 indicators, this level of agreement was not found and significant doubts were raised about their relevance and pertinence. These 13 indicators were therefore discarded. The comparative analysis of various European regions has highlighted disparities in data availability, signifying the need for continued investments in statistical capabilities and knowledge sharing (e.g. of the 83 indicators analysed from the original dataset, the regions managed to cover between 97,6% − as in the case of Andalusia − and 53 % − as in the case of the Turkish region T33 − with data available on a regional scale – as shown in Table 1  ). The regional analyses also identified indicators that were not in identified in step 1 but which, from the point of view of the identifying region, were relevant and pertinent to monitoring the SDGs. The 223 indicators identified by regions participating in the consultation process as per the Study Context (Section 3.1 ) were classified according to whether they were indicators to replace an indicator identified in step 1 (replacements, 16), indicators that complement the information provided by an indicator identified in step 1 (complements, 39), indicators that propose new measures for an indicator identified in step 1 (specific measures, 56) and new indicators, unrelated to those identified in step 1 (new indicators, 112). For all of them, agreements and discrepancies between regions, relevance, availability, and temporal and geographical coverage are analysed again. All these indicators come from the sources indicated in the previous two steps. Table 2.  . Step 4: Finalizing the indicator set. Based on the comparative analysis carried out in step 3 and considering the selection criteria that guided the previous steps, the final selection of indicators is made. Additional criteria are that there should be a solid methodological basis for the calculation of the indicator. This allows us to select indicators characterized by the following:• Clarity of definitions: Selected indicators have precise, well-articulated, understandable, and transparent definitions (available from the data providers, usually – but not always −present in the metadata description or glossary of the statistical source).  • Relevance to goals: Chosen indicators must closely align with the SDG targets they aim to measure, ensuring that data collection is directly related to progress in the targeted area.  • Data quality: Data are available, sources are reliable and data are up to date. High-quality data underpins accurate insights, informed decision-making, and credible policy formulation.    The final proposal includes 116 indicators; 70 come from the indicators identified in step 1 and the other 46 come from the contributions made by the empirical analyses carried out by the regions in step 2. Through this methodical approach, the goal was to establish a robust, actionable regional SDG monitoring framework that resonates with the specific developmental narratives of European regions.   4 A comprehensive indicator set for monitoring the SDGs The finalized selection comprises 116 indicators that facilitate monitoring the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) delineated in the 2030 Agenda, addressing 75 specific targets (see Annex 1). Approximately 52 % of the indicators originate from national or regional datasets, while the remaining 48 % are sourced from international institutions: 24 % from Eurostat, 13 % from the OECD, and 11 % from other European entities. These 116 indicators are not only in line with European-level guidelines (in particular of the JRC) and the requirements expressed by the regions (often in line with national requirements), but they are also partly consistent with European analyses, in particular of Eurostat − which selected 21 regional-level indicators for monitoring the SDGs, and the UN Global Indicator Framework (SDSN, 2015 ), which has selected 248 indicators, in total, but not always available at the regional level. This indicator set is adeptly suited for SDG monitoring within European regions as it encompasses a diverse array of targets and upholds the comprehensive sustainability vision embodied within the SDG framework. The indicators have been chosen on the basis of the criteria outlined in the methodology (see Fig. 2 ). Among them, we highlight the alignment of these indicators with the SDGs, covering important targets, as shown by the content of these indicators. First, the social sustainability pillar is addressed through indicators measuring poverty, vulnerability, and access to educational and health opportunities. This includes severe material and social deprivation rates and indicators reflecting educational engagement from early childhood to lifelong learning. Health protection is gauged through means allocation, user perceptions, and health outcomes. Social inclusion and gender equality measures are integral, with indicators tracking progress in female leadership representation and actions addressing gender-based violence, aligning with the European Pillars of Social Rights and the EU's 2030 headline targets (European Commission, 2021 ). However, the set does not cover targets such as the implementation of social protection systems or the prevention and treatment of substance abuse. Second, the environmental or 'planet' pillar is represented by indicators that, while fundamental, require continuous monitoring to preclude complacency, such as access to quality water. The set encompasses water scarcity, renewable energy access, local pollution, and contributions to global environmental challenges like climate change. Indicators include air pollution metrics, specifically PM2.5 and PM10 levels, in recognition of the health risks identified by the World Health Organization (WHO, 2021 ). Waste management, particularly recycling and reuse, aligns with the EU's Green Deal and Circular Economy Action Plan goals (European Commission, 2020 ). Regional contributions to climate change are also monitored, incorporating greenhouse gas emissions and predictive emissions modelling (Lavalle et al., 2015 ). In any case, it is important to note the difficulty in monitoring many of the targets related to the planet. Many of them, such as the degradation of natural habitats or the loss of biodiversity, are only partially covered by this set of indicators. Third, the 'prosperity' pillar, traditionally abundant in indicators, reflects a similar richness at the regional level. The selected indicators enable monitoring of economic growth, labour market structure, income distribution, and the economic impact of industry, agriculture, tourism, and research and development sectors. The collection of economic data is much more developed statistically than the collection of environmental and/or social data. As a result, these indicators may be over-represented. These indicators provide insights into the economic health of regions and facilitate the exploration of synergies and trade-offs among various SDG targets. Finally, the 'peace and partnerships' institutional pillars, primarily in SDGs 16 and 17, are addressed through indicators assessing regional contributions to developing other regions and collaborations with other regions. They also monitor access to justice and the efficacy of local governance. In summary, the curated set of indicators for regional SDG monitoring offers a thorough perspective on the trajectories regions embark on towards sustainability. The continual review and refinement of these indicators will enable the evaluation of the impacts of regional actions and policies on sustainable development progress. 4.1 Challenges and limitations Having reached this set of indicators as a proposal for monitoring the SDGs at the regional level, it is important to make several clarifications as various challenges are identified on the path to achieving and monitoring the SDGs. The SDGs recognize an intricate web of interconnected issues where pursuing a particular goal often involves making progress on some others while simultaneously moving backwards on others. This creates a complex and interdependent challenge (Le Blanc, 2015; Nilsson, et al., 2016; Alcamo et al., 2021; Bali Swain & Ranganathan, 2021; Barbier & Burgess, 2021 ). In fact, achieving SDGs targets requires significant investments which is challenging given the economic disparities between regions. In some territories, allocating and mobilizing these resources is not an easy task due to financial constrains (Vorisek & Yu, 2020; KulkarniI et al., 2022 ). In addition, monitoring the SDGs on a regular basis is also resource consuming as it requires statistical capacity to collect and interpret data (Shuai et al., 2021 ). The strengths of the proposal are that it has been developed with the involvement of several European regions which have carried out an empirical analysis of its feasibility. Regions have shown a high degree of commitment to the SDGs, highlighting their efforts to align their regional policies with the SDGs. However, some differences are observed between regions. As noted, the financial resources needed to align policies and design strategies to achieve the SDGs, as well as to monitor progress, are not available in all regions. For example, in some of the regions where the initial set of indicators was validated, information was only available for approximately 50 % of the indicators, while in other regions the information available covered almost 100 % of the indicators initially proposed. This leads us to detect shortcomings in statistical capacity in some regions. They lack the expertise and infrastructure for effective collection, analysis, and reporting of SDG data, emphasizing the crucial need for building regional statistical capacity for effective monitoring. Therefore, additional investments are needed in capacity-building for statistics, a conclusion that has also been reached in other international analysis of the SDGs (Sachs et al., 2023 ). Managing many indicators present the dual challenge of individually analysing each indicator and its corresponding target, as well as comprehensively interpreting all the indicators. In the first challenge, the evaluation of each indicator requires benchmarking and the use of reference points (Moldan et al., 2012 ) or at least to know the preferred direction of change (Wu & Wu, 2012 ). However, in benchmarking a one-size-fits-all approach may not work. Bali Swain and Ranganathan (2021)  point out that each region has its own specific structural and development contexts and hence universal benchmarking would be misleading. Regions have diverse starting points in social, environmental, or economic conditions. Universal benchmarks may not account for these regional variations. For the second challenge, difficulties arises when it comes to an overall assessment of the path towards sustainability. Obtaining good trends in all indicators may be incompatible due to trade-offs (Nilson et al., 2016; Barbier & Burgess, 2021 ). Some indicators may show an improving trend for one goal, but other indicators may show worsening trends for another goal. It is controversial whether the overall sustainability analysis is based on a weak sustainability framework, where substitution of progress in one aspect of sustainability to the detriment of another is allowed, or on a strong sustainability framework, where such substitution is not possible (Wu & Wu, 2012; Sala et al., 2015 ). There is an extensive literature on weighting and aggregation methods for sustainability indicators (Rowley et al., 2012; Gan et al., 2017; Sachs et al., 2023 ). Aggregation, however, can lead to misleading results due to diversity among regions. Differences in geography, governance, and technology, among others, make it dangerous to rely on generalized knowledge for progress in achieving the SDGs in a given region (Nilsson et al., 2016 ). In the same vein, Bali Swain and Ranganathan (2021)  conduct an analysis for different regions and show that universal benchmarking of the SDGs can be counterproductive. The set of indicators we propose is valid for all regions but the interpretation must be adjusted to the idiosyncrasies of each region. This is where customisation is important. These insights, and the fact that we have carried out a comprehensive comparison of reports on SDG monitoring in European regions, raise the question of comparability and even the sometimes controversial “rankings” on most sustainable countries or regions. The proposal of clearly defined indicators allows for harmonisation and homogenisation and facilitates comparability. But comparability does not mean ranking, as this could lead to a race to be the first, forgetting one of the fundamental ideas of the SDGs: to move forward without leaving anyone behind. There is great geographical, biological, and physical variety among the European regions, but also different levels of economic development and social cohesion (European Commission, 2022 ). These differences condition how regions respond to different shocks, such as financial crises, pandemics, wars, or periods of high inflation. Each region has unique challenges, priorities, and cultural contexts that affect their progress toward the SDGs. Interpreting progress towards the SDGs is further complicated in a changing societal context. For example, Europeans are currently experiencing unprecedented longevity, leading to a rapid evolution in the age profile of society. The process of demographic aging is reshaping the composition of some European regions, marked by a diminishing proportion of working-age individuals and a simultaneous surge in the number of older people. This transformative trend is expected to persist over the next two decades, notably as the baby-boom generation completes its transition into retirement, according to Eurostat's 2020 data. The altered demographic landscape may prompt a revaluation and reinterpretation of various indicators within the indicator set. While the impact is evident in labour market indicators like those integral to SDG8, it also reverberates across sectors such as education (SDG4) and health (SDG3). Therefore, it is strongly recommended not to overlook demographic factors in the interpretation of the indicators. Recognising and considering these demographic dynamics is fundamental to designing strategies to ensure sustainability. In European regions, the efforts being made at regional and local level to make progress towards achieving the SDGs and to monitor this progress are enormous. However, the impact these efforts have on society at large is limited. In a world in which problems such as financial crises, pandemics and wars are recurring, sustainability is sometimes neglected. Communicating progress on the SDGs to the public and raising awareness of their practical relevance can be a crucial factor for success. To achieve a sustainable transition of societies, it is mandatory to prioritize the citizens’ concerns and to appreciate their knowledge (Shulla et al., 2020 ). The contemporary world faces a myriad of challenges: climate crisis, financial upheavals, pandemics, wars, and mass migrations, among others. Many of these phenomena unfold unexpectedly, reshaping the global landscape and leaving a profound impact at the regional level. Climate change, for instance, is a catalyst for extreme weather events, including floods, droughts, and intensified storms, directly impacting various regions. Coastal areas face heightened vulnerability due to rising sea levels, while alterations in weather patterns can disrupt agricultural production, thereby affecting regional food security. Financial crises, on the other hand, have the potential to trigger job losses and income decline, directly impacting local communities and their capacity to fulfil basic needs. Pandemics, such as the recent global health crisis, exert significant pressure on regional health systems, potentially resulting in hospital overcrowding and undermining medical response capabilities. Moreover, global conflicts, whether driven by climate shocks, war, or economic crises, contribute to widespread displacement of people, directly affecting host communities at the regional level. It is imperative to consider all these global phenomena when interpreting the indicator set. The repercussions of these global shocks can mask the efforts made by regions to attain the diverse targets outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).   5 Conclusions The paper aimed at bridging the gap in regional SDG monitoring by proposing a comprehensive indicator set tailored to the European context. The United Nations' adoption of the 2030 Agenda set forth an ambitious global blueprint, and the European Union's strategic integration of the SDGs has further emphasized the need for localized and nuanced monitoring frameworks. Recognizing the diversity of European regions, this paper underscores the importance of a methodological approach that harmonizes standardization with customization, allowing for comparability while respecting regional uniqueness. The 116 indicators identified through a systematic and inclusive process offer a pragmatic means to monitor progress across various sustainability domains. The indicator set is derived from a blend of established and experimental metrics, with robust representation across national, regional, and European sources. This rich tapestry of data points provides a multidimensional view of sustainable development within the European fabric, ensuring that every region is included in the march towards the collective goals. Several key themes have emerged through the course of this research: as per the literature and monitoring practice, the importance of fostering regional data capacities and infrastructure cannot be overstated, as they are foundational to effective monitoring and informed decision-making. The comparative analysis of various European regions has exposed significant disparities in data availability, emphasizing the urgent need for sustained investments in statistical capabilities and enhanced knowledge sharing. The set facilitates strategic policy alignment, allowing regions to measure their progress against the European Green Deal and other significant policy initiatives. It also serves as a valuable benchmarking tool that encourages mutual learning and collective growth rather than competitive hierarchies. Considering the systemic nature of the SDGs, the indicator set is engineered to elucidate the interdependencies between targets, offering policymakers a comprehensive perspective. This integrated view allows for anticipating the cascading effects of regional actions, ensuring a harmonious pursuit of sustainable development across multiple fronts. Anticipated demographic shifts, such as the ageing population in Europe, will influence the relevance and focus of specific indicators. These societal changes will affect among others the labour market, education systems, and healthcare services, necessitating adaptive strategies informed by the indicators. Thus, maintaining the momentum towards the SDGs requires strategies responsive to the evolving societal context. Engaging the public in the SDG discourse through transparent reporting based on the indicator set is crucial for building a culture of sustainability. Moreover, the proposed indicators are not static measurements but dynamic tools that can adapt to emerging challenges and demographic shifts, such as the ageing population in Europe. The indicators' flexibility will be crucial for regions to navigate the evolving societal landscape and continue advancing towards the SDGs. Public engagement, facilitated by transparent reporting and communication, will play a vital role in embedding sustainability into the public consciousness and fostering a participatory approach to regional development. In crafting this indicator set, the paper has also navigated the delicate balance between the breadth of monitoring required by the SDGs and the practicality of implementation. The optimal number of indicators allows for comprehensive yet manageable monitoring tailored to each region's unique capacities and contexts. As we look to the future, this indicator set's ongoing refinement and application will be instrumental in shaping sustainable development practices across Europe. It will enable policymakers, stakeholders, and practitioners to chart an informed, strategic, and inclusive course. The insights gleaned from this research contribute to a broader understanding of regional sustainability and offer a valuable resource for those committed to realizing the vision of the 2030 Agenda. The path towards sustainable development is a collective endeavour that requires commitment, collaboration, and innovation at all levels. The regional indicator set proposed in this paper is a step towards equipping European regions with the tools to effectively monitor their sustainability journeys. It is a call to action for continued progress, informed by data, driven by policy, and inspired by the shared goal of a sustainable and prosperous future for all. Annex I.
