                  This research aims to measure the impact of energy poverty in Pakistan and its effect on the social wellbeing of individuals in Pakistan. This thought of energy destitution toward the family doesn't surely know with regards to literature as it might allude to either ‘economic poor’ or ‘energy poor’ state of the household. This study utilizes the Pakistan Social and Living Standard Measurement (PSLM) overview and data set contains from 2003 to 2018 to examine the effects of energy destitution on the wellbeing, instruction and acquiring chances of the families. The empirical findings of the exploration propose that the energy neediness of a household is firmly connected with the sort of fuel utilized and the low utilization of unreasonably expensive clean energy by the family. The subsequent effects of energy neediness on the prosperity of families are huge. It is observed that energy helpless families have a greater likelihood toward the individuals experiencing respiratory issues, paying more on clinical consideration, dropping out of school and lesser acquiring openings than the household without energy destitution.

Business School, Shanghai Jianqiao University, Shanghai, China Business School Shanghai Jianqiao University Shanghai China       This research aims to measure the impact of energy poverty in Pakistan and its effect on the social wellbeing of individuals in Pakistan. This thought of energy destitution toward the family doesn't surely know with regards to literature as it might allude to either ‘economic poor’ or ‘energy poor’ state of the household. This study utilizes the Pakistan Social and Living Standard Measurement (PSLM) overview and data set contains from 2003 to 2018 to examine the effects of energy destitution on the wellbeing, instruction and acquiring chances of the families. The empirical findings of the exploration propose that the energy neediness of a household is firmly connected with the sort of fuel utilized and the low utilization of unreasonably expensive clean energy by the family. The subsequent effects of energy neediness on the prosperity of families are huge. It is observed that energy helpless families have a greater likelihood toward the individuals experiencing respiratory issues, paying more on clinical consideration, dropping out of school and lesser acquiring openings than the household without energy destitution.   Keywords Energy poverty  Clean energy  Social wellbeing  Energy poor  Pakistan  Sustainable development goals   JEL classification E11  D48    1 Introduction Energy poverty is a serious problem in developing countries around the globe. There was thirty-eight (38) million hungry people in the world in 2015. Moreover, in 2016, the figure raised to 85 million due to the global economic losses around the world [1 ]. The World Bank reports indicate that out of 1.42 billion poor people, around 500 million people are from South Asia. A high level of multidimensional poverty was faced by Sri Lankan households (83%) as shown by pricing approach. The quantity approach revealed very high energy poverty in the case of cooking. The Sri Lankan population observed a significant increase in energy access in urban and rural areas [2 ]. Multidimensional poverty analytically discloses issues in the light of SDGs where poverty eradication is one of the first goals carried out. Padda and Hameed's [3 ] investigated the same problems affiliated with health status, education attainment, living standards, and inadequacy within territory to address some of the SDGs through MPI (multidimensional poverty Index). In South Africa, low income rural households were more energy deprived in contrast to those in areas. Whereas, Jain (2010) explored the Indian urban areas energy poverty was about 24% and 89% in rural areas. Sadath and Acharya (2017) used Indian Household Human Development Survey to assess the energy poverty in India and identified that 78% of households were energy poor. Awan et al. (2013) measured the energy poverty in Pakistan by following the methodology proposed by Alkire and Foster [4 ] and Alkire and Santos Alkire and Santos (2010). Apere et al. Apere et al. (2014) used Nussbaumer et al. Nussbaumer et al. (2011) methodology to analyze the multidimensional energy poverty in Nigeria. Three major indicators are used to measure MEPI i.e. light access, fresh indoor air access and modern fuels access. The study showed that 95% of Nigerians are energy poor and weighted indicators deprivation is 74%. The MEPI is 70%. Ogwumike and Ozughalu Ogwumike and Ozughalu (2012) and Nussbaumer et al. Nussbaumer et al. (2011) found that 81% and 75.5% of Nigerian are energy poor respectively. Therefore, this study is the first ever attempt to estimate the influence of SDGs in order to eradicate the multidimensional energy poverty in Pakistan. It consists of four core areas for instance; energy poverty, clean energy, social wellbeing, and energy poor. This study takes four provinces for instance; (Baluchistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), Punjab, and Sindh) of Pakistan to investigate this relationship under the domain of SDGs. This study is based on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1 and 7 and both goals have been measured poverty and clean, affordable and modern energy respectively to inspect critically for its eradication by using Alkire and Foster's [4 ] methodology. Therefore, this exploration characterizes energy destitution as far as the absence of availability or potentially reasonableness of energy, which might cause the hardship for a household and influence its prosperity. The results of this study help the government, policymakers, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to design strategies for equitable resource allocation with respect to indicators.  2 Literature review Along with a variety of macro and micro issues, economic development is considered a high level issue. Access to clean and modern energy resources are indispensable for human well-being. Modi et al. Modi et al. (2006) demonstrated fact that the world is fronting severe energy poverty. One third of the world population is reliant on wood and other inefficient fuels like crop residuals, crack, and dung, etc. For cooking. The population has no electricity access is one fourth of the world population, and most of them are pertaining to Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia and Sub-Sahel Africa. The consequences of energy poverty are multidimensional, making these economies more vulnerable. Tennakoon Tennakoon (2009) employed a pricing approach and quantitative approach to measure energy poverty in Sri Lanka. A high level of multidimensional energy poverty was faced by Sri Lankan households (energy poverty 83%) as shown by Pricing Approach. The Quantity approach revealed very high energy poverty in the case of cooking. The Sri Lankan population observed significant increase in energy access in rural and urban areas [2 ]. Mahmood and Shah Mahmood and Shah (2017) calculated MEPI for Pakistani households at national and provincial levels by using the household Survey (PSLM) data set 2010–11. They followed the methodology proposed by Nussbaumer et al. Nussbaumer et al. (2012), and Alkire and Foster Alkire and Foster (2007). Six indicators-modern fuel for cooking, electricity access, transportation means, refrigerator, fan, and TV/Radio were used to measure energy poverty. Overall energy deprivation at the household level is 26.4%. The deprivation index in Baluchistan is 43.1%, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is 29%, in Sindh 24.9%, and in Punjab 21%. The rural households were more energy deprived than the urban household. The effects of multidimensional energy destitution and climate disturbances on multivariate health degradations in Pakistan are investigated in this research. The empirical findings reveal that scarcity has a significant and positive effect on health poverty in Pakistan, notwithstanding the endogenous relationship that exists between them [5 ,6 ]. Nawaz [7 ] measures the effects of multidimensional energy destitution and environmental shocks on health deprivations in Pakistan. The empirical analysis found that energy poverty has a favorable and significant effect on health poverty in Pakistan, notwithstanding the endogenous nature of the association between energy destitution and health outcomes. Ann and Mirza Ann and Mirza (2021) used PSLM 2014-15 data to empirically estimate the incidence and intensity of energy poverty in Pakistani households. They developed the index by using seven dimensions based on weighted criteria. The findings of their study suggested that 55% of Pakistani households were energy poor. Moreover, the households of the Sindh and Baluchistan provinces were more vulnerable to energy poverty. By using Energy Poverty Survey (EPS) 2008–09, Mirza and Szirmai Mirza and Szirmai (2010) constructed the various indexes for measuring inconveniences faced by households and investigated the consequences and features of different energy sources. The study found that the percentage of rural households facing energy poverty was 96.6 for overall Pakistan and 91.7 for Punjab province.  3 Methodology The study is trying to determine the prevalence of energy poverty and social well beings in four provinces of Pakistan. The sample of this study consists of four provinces such as, (Baluchistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), Punjab, and Sindh) of Pakistan. This study takes three hundred (300) household from each four provinces and total sample consists of twelve hundred (1200) households. The following are two definitions of energy poverty used in this research to create the likelihood function of multidimensional energy poverty for every family member: The primary notion or method is a multi-dimensional concept that takes into account distinct patterns of energy expenditure and income groups within every income quintile cluster. However, the principal approach assumes that a household's resource allocation for its basket of a commodity is the rationale. It is noted that energy consumption is crucial and among the most important components of a household's consumption budget. The upper income class (the fifth quintile) is likewise thought to have a small share or proportion of energy spending to total spending since energy utilization is projected to hit a saturation point as income rises, and the higher income class prefers to spend mostly on luxurious commodities. As a result, the probability function of an extended family or household being multidimensional energy poor in our study includes these two main approaches. A community is energy poor if it fits the entire following basis: (i) it cooks with biomass; (ii) its per capita energy intake is in the lowest quintile; and (iii) its per capita energy intake exceeds 10 % of overall household spending. The following statement can be used to convey the above aspects of energy poverty:P ( Y i    = 1  )  = J  ( Y i    = G 1   )  + J (  Y i    = { G 2    , G 3  ,  G 4   }   &  S > 10 %  )  +  J ( Y i   = R i   )       P ( Y i    = 0  )     If non-energy destitute.Where, the per capita household energy spending quintile groups are G1, G2, G3 and G4; and the household consuming biomass for cooking food is Ri. “S” is the percentage of total household spending that is spent on energy. J(.) is a measure relation that takes on a valuation of 1 assuming the bracketed articulation is valid, and 0 assuming in any case. Then, at that point, J(.) equivalents to 1 and the family (household community) would be viewed as energy poor. Subsequently, energy neediness frequency is:E P 0  = 1 N   ∑  i = 1  n  [  J  ( Y i    = G 1   )  + J (  Y i    = { G 2    , G 3  ,  G 4   }   &  S > 10 %  )  +  J ( Y i    = R i   )  ]       If once the energy destitution marker is determined, it is vital to explore the energy neediness impacts individuals' wellbeing. 3.1 Empirical model 3.1.1 Impact of energy poverty multidimensions on well-being After determining the poverty of energy measure, it's essential to look into how energy poverty affects individual's lives. This is a major element of our research. Energy poverty is thought to have a significant influence on a household's well-being, as power is consumed for daily life, according to the studies reviewed above. Inadequate energy consumption, as a result of poor energy supply and traditional biomass, is likely to have an impact on human empowerment - the individual, those of children's, and the household. It is observed that, illumination is projected to have a favorable impact on a child's schooling, lowering the likelihood of him or her dropping out. In Pakistan, electricity is utilized for cooking, cleaning, and assisting domestic tasks, having access to contemporary energy boosts efficiency in accomplishing household chores. For instance, using power to pump out fresh water from ground is much handy than obtaining water from a faraway surface water sources. Consequently, it is significant to observe different factors in the informational collection which are exceptionally corresponded with energy neediness yet not related with residual of Eq. (1)  in underneath. In this manner, the model detail can be composed as:(1) W e l l b e i n g i  =  γ 0  + γ 1  E P i  + γ 2  D i  +  U i 1       (2) E P i ∗  =  μ 0  +  μ 1  I V i  + U i 2       where, ‘wellbeing (individual's prosperity)' is the reliant variable and it addresses youngster's schooling outcome; health outcome; and earning capacity. Although ‘respiratory disease indicates that member of the household has breathing problems is used as a proxy variable for health outcome in this study. Similarly, the per capita income of the members of household is used as ‘earning ability’ and ‘schooling outcome’ is replaced by child inside a particular age class is accounted for to have exited school. Meanwhile, “I V i  "    is the arrangement of exogenous factors in the data that are profoundly associated with the E P i     variable however not associated with the " U i 1   "   . The structural equation's constants are unbiased in the two-stage least square (2SLS) estimation (Wooldridge, 2003). The reduced form of structural Eq. (1)  estimation is as follows:(3) W e l l b e i n g i  =  γ 0  + γ 1  E P i ∗   +  γ 2  D i  +  U i 1        Since the reliant factors of structural Eq. (1)  are differentiated for the variable of “schooling outcome and health outcome”, obtaining the value of 1 on the off chance that a family has something like one youngster announced as ‘school dropout’, and the value of 0 assuming in any case, and obtaining the value of 1 assuming the family has no less than one kid debilitated with a respiratory illness and the value of 0 for in any case, subsequently, the regression of the underlying condition on sets on autonomous variables appear as the Probit model, in that the assessment is communicated in the latent variable as beneath:(4) W e l l b e i n g i ∗  = γ D i  + ε i 1       (5) γ D i  = γ 0  +  γ 1  E P i ∗  + γ 2  D i      ε i 1   | D i  ∼  N  (  0,1 )        where D i     is the aggregated type of the regressors and, in this way, the reliant variable can be seen as follow:W e l l b e i n g i  ≡ 1 ( H e a l t h i ∗   > 0 )      Pr ( W e l l b e i n g i  = 1 | D i    )  = G ( γ 0  +  γ 1  E P i ∗  +  γ 2  D i   )   = G ( γ D i   )  = φ ( z )      where the standard normal density function as well as standard normal cumulative distribution in standard normal terms are:φ  ( z )  = ∫ − ∞  z  ( υ )  d v   ;  φ ( z )  = e  2 π   1  xp [ − ( Z )  2  2   ]          4 Results and discussion This study empirically explores the drivers of energy neediness in Pakistan. The investigation's key factors are ‘wellbeing’ and energy poverty as those are the variables ‘health status, a dropout from school, children labour hours, and per capita income.’ This exploration consists of four provinces of Pakistan such as, (Baluchistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), Punjab, and Sindh) to analyze the observation. The study takes data set from the Pakistan Social and Living Standard Measurement (PSLM) survey and contains from 2003 to 2018. All data sets have taken from Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) and used the repeated cross-sections of multiple indicator cluster survey (MICS) data. The probability function is used to construct the factor ‘energy poverty,’ which is based on numerous criteria as outlined in the methodology section and notion of energy poverty. If a family member is deemed energy poor, the statistic ‘energy poverty’ assumes the value 1; otherwise, it uses the input 0 (Table 1  ). For the individuals who burn through power, particularly families associated with the public framework or off-network utilizing power, the review recommended that per capita power utilization should be over 117 kWh/individual/month or 1400 kWh/individual/year for that individual to be over the energy neediness line (Table 2  ). The discoveries (Tables 3–5    ) recommended that energy destitution is emphatically connected with old-style fuel consumption of fuelwood, lamp oil for lighting, and in blend with lacking energy use because of ‘exorbitance'. The people group normal for being in the rustic region appears to build the likelihood of respiratory issues contrasted with that in the metropolitan region. This additionally focuses on the way that families living in provincial regions have helpless power administration and, consequently, energy use choices are restricted to firewood for making food and lamp oil for lighting (Table 3 ). Table 4  highlights the regression coefficient for the healthcare outcome ‘respiratorys illness. Which reveals that energy poverty is associated with poor health in children [8 ]. The energy-neediness influences the school participation, particularly the kid. The underlined reason could be that youngsters might include additional time in gathering firewood or performing some other family tasks. The outcomes recommend that the likelihood of school dropout rate is considered among the energy destitution bunch contrasted with non-energy neediness bunch (Table 5 ). Likewise, such increment diminished the procuring capacity of energy helpless families by 48% contrasted with the non-energy-neediness bunch (Table 6  ). In Table 6 , the consequences of relapse revealed that only family with finished university has positive contact with procuring capacity. In contrast, Apergis et al., [9 ]; and Zhang et al. Zhang et al. (2021) findings demonstrated that education have a detrimental influence on energy poverty. Accordingly, these outcomes emphatically proposed to have a completed degree from university to affect acquiring capacity. Next to that, all regression results highlight the proof affirming that energy neediness is unequivocally connected to energy affordability and availability.  5 Conclusion This research is the principal investigator of its sort in Pakistan that empirically examines the drivers of the occurrence regarding energy destitution in the nation. The idea of energy destitution in Pakistan was created in this analysis to feature the circumstance looked by households with an alternate sort of energy affordability and access simultaneously. The empirical findings propose that the occurrence of energy destitution is high throughout the regions in Pakistan. The concentration additionally researched the effects of energy destitution on the social wellbeing of households. The crucial discoveries proposed that energy neediness builds the anticipated likelihood of a household part becoming ill with respiratory sickness contrasted with the non-energy-destitution bunch. The families impacted by energy destitution will probably have decreased earning capacity by 48pc contrasted with those not impacted by energy neediness. Moreover, children matured 17 years as well as underneath energy helpless families are probably going to be vulnerable to, and have a higher likelihood of being debilitated with, respiratory sicknesses contrasted with those of the non-energy-neediness bunch. Likewise, energy helpless families are possible have greater cash based costs identified with infection, particularly respiratory issues, as contrasted with the non-energy-neediness bunch. All the more critically, the review recommended that for a family to remain over the energy destitution line, the yearly power utilization ought to be above 583.3 kWh/household/month, expecting the average Pakistan family comprises of six people. The general outcomes affirmed that energy neediness is emphatically related to the nature of fuel uses and energy access. Due to the unavailability of information, this study ignored Child crime rate to this analysis. As this can be one of the important determinants of energy poverty in Pakistan. Future research can be done by using data on the Child crime rates to evaluate social wellbeing. In light of its assessment, the review proposes needs of the immediate policies of energy strategy estimates focusing on the arrangement of reasonable and clean energy for helpless households to lessen/take out energy neediness in Pakistan.
