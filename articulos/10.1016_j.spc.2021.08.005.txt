                  The 2030 agenda for sustainable development sets goals to strengthen the economic, environmental, and social sectors of the world. Among the main objectives are to eradicate poverty in the world, guarantee food security and human well-being, as well as the sustainable production of resources. The most important challenges are in rural areas where it is difficult to access food, electricity, fuel, and sanitary services. To overcome resource limitations, the optimization of the water-energy-food nexus has been proposed to boost the economic development of disadvantaged rural communities, this has been addressed through the correct management of available resources to ensure that the inhabitants have access to basic social services and a healthy diet. In this work, a mathematical model is provided for the sustainable production via integration of water, energy, and food in disadvantage rural communities, determining the optimal mix of technologies to supply the utility demands and the variety of food to cover nutritional requirements. The model formulation is a Stochastic Mixed Integer Linear Program, and it considers the population change and the water and energy demand as uncertain parameters. A Mexican community was selected as case study demonstrating the applicability of the model. Results show that it is feasible to create a system that enables the community to be self-sufficient and provide a balanced diet for inhabitants using renewable technologies and considering waste treatment. Moreover, with the proposed integration, it is possible to reduce the poverty and marginalization index by 8% per year with proper profit management.

Editor: Prof. Ignacio Grossmann The 2030 agenda for sustainable development sets goals to strengthen the economic, environmental, and social sectors of the world. Among the main objectives are to eradicate poverty in the world, guarantee food security and human well-being, as well as the sustainable production of resources. The most important challenges are in rural areas where it is difficult to access food, electricity, fuel, and sanitary services. To overcome resource limitations, the optimization of the water-energy-food nexus has been proposed to boost the economic development of disadvantaged rural communities, this has been addressed through the correct management of available resources to ensure that the inhabitants have access to basic social services and a healthy diet. In this work, a mathematical model is provided for the sustainable production via integration of water, energy, and food in disadvantage rural communities, determining the optimal mix of technologies to supply the utility demands and the variety of food to cover nutritional requirements. The model formulation is a Stochastic Mixed Integer Linear Program, and it considers the population change and the water and energy demand as uncertain parameters. A Mexican community was selected as case study demonstrating the applicability of the model. Results show that it is feasible to create a system that enables the community to be self-sufficient and provide a balanced diet for inhabitants using renewable technologies and considering waste treatment. Moreover, with the proposed integration, it is possible to reduce the poverty and marginalization index by 8% per year with proper profit management.

Most of them are related to the social and economic conditions of disadvantaged communities. These goals aim to promote sustainable economic growth, ensure access to affordable and reliable energy, guarantee the availability and sustainable management of water, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and take actions to combat climate change and its impacts (United Nations, 2015 ). However, to accomplish the objectives listed in the Agenda, it is necessary to invest in infrastructure and to start new productive processes that generate economic growth and, at the same time, do not compromise the resources for the future which is a complicated challenge that needs multidisciplinary efforts. Moreover, these initiatives must be able to endure unexpected scenarios or uncertain events such as the effects of global warming, demographic changes and/or natural disasters. The Water-Energy-Food (WEF) nexus has become a fundamental issue to achieve the aforementioned objectives since it is an effective instrument for decision-making analysis toward sustainable development (Biggs et al., 2015 ; Zhang and Vesselinov, 2017 ) and it is a useful tool to ensure the fulfillment of the basic human needs if applied correctly. Consequently, strategies need to be created to establish policies that guarantee universal access (in a sustainable way) to basic resources and services for people living in disadvantaged rural communities (DRC) in developing countries. People without access to electricity are those with the lowest income (Bustos and Watts, 2017 ). In developing countries, 4.5 billion people lack access to safe water services (WHO, 2017a ) and 1.1 billion people (14% of the global population) do not have access to electricity (IEA, 2017 ). Besides, although malnutrition has been declining in rural communities, around 780 million poor people still suffer undernourishment (FAO, 2019 ). Extensive efforts have been implemented to establish strategies to guarantee accessibility to water, energy, and food in developing countries. The water-energy (WE) nexus has been widely studied due to its strong interrelation in its production, distribution and consumption (Hamiche et al., 2016 ). To date, the water (Cai et al., 2019 ) and energy security (Shah et al., 2019 ) is essential to guarantee sustainable development, and the WE nexus approach has been implemented for different applications, like the interaction in big urban areas with different productive sectors (Fang and Chen, 2017 ), insulated systems with special needs and limited resources (Fuentes-Cortés and Ponce-Ortega, 2017 ; Aberilla et al., 2020 ) and integrated industrial processes (Gabriel et al., 2016 ). On the other hand, research on the water-food nexus and energy-food nexus has focused, particularly on the agricultural sector. Most of these studies have suggested strategies to optimize the irrigation process (Liu et al., 2019 ) and the supply chain of biofuel production (Goswami and Hazarika, 2016 ; López-Díaz et al., 2018 ). Notwithstanding, more research focused on achieving and optimizing food security and reducing food waste is needed. Analyzing the security of the WEF nexus is a global challenge that must be faced in a multi-disciplinary way to achieve the development of sustainable and resilient systems (Namany et al., 2019 ). In this regard, WEF nexus modeling is a useful tool to promote efficient and sustainable resource production and management, especially in DRC. This way, it is important to involve environmental, economic and social metrics to address the WEF nexus. The furtherance of integrated tools to assess the quantification of environmental impacts has been incorporated, since it allows providing quantitative information regarding the linkages of the nexus (Lin et al., 2019 ). In this sense, Al-Ansari et al. (2015)  develop a life cycle assessment tool that integrates the water, energy and food to translate the systems outputs into environmental assessment scores. Vanham et al. (2019)  proposed a family of footprints that allows measuring progress toward Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) throughout the Water-Energy-Food-Ecosystem nexus. On the other hand, the return of investment for sustainable process (El-Halwagi, 2017 ) and minimization of the total annual cost (Roni et al., 2019 ) have been the most used economic objectives in optimization. Regarding social objectives, jobs generation (Chazara et al., 2017 ), social acceptance (Irfan et al., 2021 ), and human development index (Dufo-López et al., 2016 ) are some of the metrics that could be implemented in the WEF nexus modelling. Several works have focused on optimizing the WEF Nexus taking into account the economic, environmental and social perspectives individually; however, it is crucial to include these three elements simultaneously to achieve the sustainable development of any region. Because of the WEF nexus is a complex framework made up of diverse linked sectors where several stakeholders are involved, the Multi-objective Optimization (MOO) is one of the best ways to find feasible solutions. In the optimization of the WEF nexus, the access to water, energy and food must be ensured through technical constraints, as well as environmental, economic, and social metrics that must be minimized or maximized. Thus, the problem will be composed of several contradictory objectives, which means that it will be possible to obtain a more ideal solution for one objective than for another, but it can be adjusted for the convenience of all decision makers. Most of the reported approaches for WEF modeling have been solved using deterministic frameworks. Nonetheless, for a better representation of reality, many optimization problems are modeled as stochastic optimization problems because they can be exposed to important disturbances (Tovar-Facio et al., 2017 ). Stochastic optimization models have been addressed at different scales, Garcia and You (2016)  have included challenges from household to global scales considering uncertainty in the water, energy and food supply. At household level, Karan et al. (2018)  proposed a stochastic optimization framework for the design of a household WEF system under different climatic conditions. In other works, special attention has been paid to the development of one sector of the WEF nexus. In this regard, a vast literature has focused in agriculture and its interconections with water and energy. For instance, Li et al. (2019)  develped an integrated model of the WEF nexus in agriculture systems involving uncertainty related to natural conditions, the model was capable to identify trade-offs between water and energy supply-demand for food production. Nevertheless, although many models have been proposed at different scales, in the best of our knowledge, none of them have been developed with the objective of meeting the needs and challenges that DRC must face to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. The absence of technologies for the sustainable management of resources in DRC causes lack of essential products and services, mainly in relation to the food security of the population. Therefore, in this paper, food production and land use for agriculture and cattle activities were optimized to guarantee the minimum nutritional requirements of the population. We focus on proposing interrelated systems to reach sustainable development goals in DRC. Furthermore, to show the importance of considering uncertainty in the WEF nexus design we consider uncertain population, and uncertain water and energy demand that can unbalance the sustainability in future scenarios. The novelty of the work lies in the development of an optimization model for the integration of water, energy and food that allows reducing the poverty in DRC and satisfying the required nutrients for population. A novel index for the quantification of the poverty is introduced which involves social indicators related to education, health, social security, housing services and access to food. The WEF nexus system was approached using Multi-objective Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). MILP was used to select the optimal design of the system owing to there is more than one technological option to satisfy the demands in the DRC, and the binary decision variables allow enabling and disabling the existence of technologies, as well as their associated sizes and costs.  2 Problem statement Disadvantaged rural communities are often low-income settlements that have limited access to basic services and resources. In these communities, most of the people suffer social, medical, and educational deprivations in addition to malnutrition. Food insecurity in disenfranchised rural communities (DRC) affects millions of people in the world, especially in developing countries (FAO, 2012 ). DRC in developing countries is related to high percentages of poverty, lack of access to water and energy services, underdeveloped agriculture and unstable or even unavailable markets because these communities are generally isolated and located at long distances from others. Access to nutritious food in rural areas is limited mainly by lack of transportation infrastructure and financial constraints (FAO, 2018 ). Therefore, the inhabitants cannot always have enough nutritious and affordable food.  Fig. 1  shows a general representation of a DRC, where new technologies are considered to improve the access to resources and the nutrition of people, and reduce poverty. The consumers of water and energy are households, and agricultural and livestock productions. The products of these economic activities are consumed by local people, and waste is treated for disposal or reuse by consumers. A brief description of how the proposed problem was addressed is presented below:▪ A set of crops and food of animal origin is defined to satisfy the minimum nutritional intake of the population and to guarantee food security.  ▪ There is a lack of coverage in the electricity service. Then, electricity demand can be supplied by installing new solar panels and/or cogeneration units (CHP) (Yellow line of Fig. 1 ).  ▪ Households do not have access to hot water, so this utility should be provided by the aforementioned cogeneration units and/or solar thermal collectors (evacuated tube collectors) through a thermal storage system. (Red line of Fig. 1 )  ▪ Water demand is supplied by water abstraction; however, there is the option of installing rainwater collectors if suitable. Furthermore, water treatment plants are proposed to reuse water in different activities. (Blue line of Fig. 1 )  ▪ Municipal solid waste (MSW) management is carried out. Solid waste is separated into recycled and biodegradable waste. The biodegradable waste is sent to conversion technologies (gasification and pyrolysis) to obtain value-added chemicals and biofuels to cover the energetic requirements in the cogeneration system and reduce the natural gas consumption. (Green line of Fig. 1 )  ▪ Changes in the population are considered due to the DRC is affected by population migration (Torres and Carte, 2016 ).  ▪ The optimal system must satisfy water, energy and food needs considering different population scenarios. Furthermore, the optimal system must improve DRC access to basic services and decrease the standards of marginalization and poverty.     3 Methodology The proposed approach is based on the deterministic model previously reported by Cansino-Loeza and Ponce-Ortega (2019) , which has been extended introducing constraints to satisfy the nutritional requirements of the DRC through the optimal food production. Furthermore, social indexes to quantify the improvement of the communities were introduced. In addition, the model was developed as a stochastic formulation using a scenario-based approach for considering population changes. The model was formulated for a full year in monthly time steps, involving environmental parameters such as the monthly solar radiation and precipitation for the selection of renewable technologies. This model is based on the proposed superstructure (Fig. 1 ), and it involves energy and mass balances to satisfy electricity, water, and food demands. The objective is to give access to the aforementioned services and to improve the quality of life in the DRC. A complete description of the model developed is included in the supplementary material section. 3.1 Uncertain parameters The water and energy demand as well as the number of inhabitants in the community have been considered as uncertain parameters. In this case, historical data is limited or unknow. An alternative approximation used to overcome the lack of information was to suppose a normal distribution to generate data from average values and to use the standard deviation of the proposed distribution to take values around a reference point. We assume variations of standard deviation in the distribution (we assume variations with 5%, 10% and 15%) of the uncertain parameters to evaluate the impact of the uncertainty in the case study. In this way, it is possible to evaluate the resilience of the system in the community and study its behavior in future scenarios. The uncertain parameters were considered using a scenario-based stochastic optimization approach. It is important to mention that considering the number of inhabitants as uncertain parameter has great relevance because in rural communities the movement of population to other areas is frequent. Rural communities in developing countries are home of the most disadvantaged people and due to their characteristics has uncertain population. In these communities the fertility rate is high due to the lack of health services and because children are a source of family labor. Otherwise, rural-to-urban migration has increased due to the poverty and lack of opportunities. Migration can help people to improve their quality of life, but also it may cause overpopulation and competition for services in other places. Likewise, this could be a driven for poverty increase in urban areas. In cases where rural population grow, there can be economic growth with technological progress and adequate infrastructure. However, it can also contribute to declines in per-capita incomes and environmental issues. This motivates to develop systems for a sustainable integration resources that lead to an improvement in the social conditions of rural communities in developing countries.  3.2 Water and energy demand Water demand was calculated based on the water consumed per capita. The World Health Organization reported a quantity of 20 liters of water per capita per day to ensure the satisfaction of basic hygiene needs and food hygiene (WHO, 2017b) . On the other hand, the electricity demand was calculated based on the electric power consumption per capita reported by the Secretary of Energy in Mexico, which corresponds to 2,100 kWh per capita per year (SENER, 2017 ). Therefore, based on the aforementioned data, the model calculates the monthly water/energy demands by multiplying the monthly service requirements by the number of inhabitants in each of the scenarios.  3.3 Energy supply The optimization model enables to select renewable or fossil technologies based on technical, economic, and environmental constrains. To produce electricity, solar panels (PV) and cogeneration units (CHP) are proposed. Cogeneration units are technologies able to produce thermal and electric energy. In this work, Internal Combustion Engines (ICE), Fuel Cells (FC), Microturbines (MT), and Stirling Engines (SE) are the proposed technologies that represent the CHP units. To meet the energetic requirements, natural gas or biofuel obtained by the waste treatment technologies were used. Capacity of the CHP units is limited by their maximum available capacity. On the other hand, renewable energy such as solar panels were proposed to generate electricity. The selection of the capacity of solar panels was determined by the available solar radiation. In the proposed model there is considered an average of the solar radiation per month. Furthermore, the installation of solar panels is limited by the maximum available area in the region that is adequate for the installation of photovoltaic technology.  3.4 Water supply Water supply to satisfy the domestic, agriculture and cattle demands can be meet by the water abstracted from wells and the water collected from the rainwater systems (RW). The design of the rainwater collection systems is based on the monthly precipitation in the DRC, and the model determines the collection area. The area for the rainwater system installation was limited by the maximum collection area in accordance with the conditions of the DRC. Furthermore, to decrease the water abstraction, it was proposed the installation of the greywater (GWP) and the blackwater (BWP) treatment plants. The wastewater generated by the domestic sector can be treated in the corresponding plants, and the reclaimed water from the GWP can be reused in the domestic, agriculture and livestock sectors. On the other hand, the hot water supply can be covered by the water provided by the cogeneration technologies, boilers and solar heats. The selection of the boilers is determined by their efficiency and maximum available capacity. Similarly, the selection of solar heat is determined by the monthly solar radiation and is limited by its maximum available capacity.  3.5 Nutritional requirements In this section, constraints related to the nutritional requirements to achieve the food security of population are described. Fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes and meat production (f  ) are the different types of food involved to cover the food demand. Food production is determined by the availability of water and the land available for agriculture (mass balances are detailed in the supplementary material section). However, food production must be enough to cover the minimum recommended nutrients and calories (n  ) that humans need to stay healthy (Table 1   ). Therefore, the following constrains are included in the mathematical model to evaluate the optimal selection of technologies, as well as the agriculture and livestock outputs to achieve the WEF nexus security considering uncertain population, and water and energy demand. The total nutrients provided to the community (N u t r i e n t s  n , t , s      ) (calories, carbohydrates, protein, lipids and fiber) are calculated based on the food production in the DRC (F o o d f , t , s     ), and they are calculated by multiplying the nutritional content of each type of food (υ f , n    ) by the amount of type of food generated (F o o d f , t , s     ). Therefore, the produced food must reach the nutrients required by the community as follows:(1) N u t r i e n t s n , t , s   = ∑ f  F o o d f , t , s   · υ f , n   ,           ∀ n , ∀ t , ∀ s      In addition, the total nutrients of food production (N u t r i e n t s  n , t , s      ) must be equal to the nutrient intake per inhabitant (n u t n , t , s     ) multiplied by the inhabitants of the community (μ s   ):(2) N u t r i e n t s  n , t , s    = μ s  · n u t n , t , s   ,          ∀ n , ∀ t , ∀ s     The total nutrients of the food produced (Nutrientsn,t,s  ) are bounded by the minimum (fn nmin  ) and maximum (fn nmax  ) nutritional intake that inhabitants require for a balanced diet.(3) f n n max   ≥ N u t r i e n t s n , t , s   ,         ∀ n , ∀ t , ∀ s     (4) f n n min   ≤ N u t r i e n t s n , t , s   ,           ∀ n , ∀ t , ∀ s       3.6 Social index This section presents a methodology for the assessment of the Poverty and Marginalization Index. In addition, a strategy for the distribution of economic resources is proposed in order to eradicate deprivation in the community and decrease the Poverty and Marginalization Index. It is important to point out that this methodology was implemented once were obtained the results of the mathematical model for the sustainable design of the WEF nexus in the DRC. Poverty is a social and economic condition that impedes the satisfaction of the basic needs of inhabitants. People suffering from poverty are exposed to the deprivation of services and food, and this can be assessed through the main indicators that represent the deficiencies to which the population is exposed. The National Council for the Evaluation of Social Development Policy in Mexico (CONEVAL) considers the following indicators to calculate the Poverty and Marginalization Index:▪ Educational backwardness ( I E D    ) . Education is a necessary discipline that enables people to develop skills and acquire knowledge. People with a lack of education limit their cultural and economic prospects, which restricts their ability to make decisions.  ▪ Access to Health Services ( I H S    ) . One of the fundamental elements that provides the basis for the maintenance of human existence is the access to health services. The availability of medical staff and facilities, as well as the accessibility to them, are some of the aspects that poor people lack.  ▪ Access to Social Security ( I S S    ) . Social security is related to guaranteeing the livelihood of individuals and their families in case of accidents or illnesses.  ▪ Basic Housing Services ( I C S    ) . The quality of life of the inhabitants is also related to the physical environment in which people live, it means, their house. Both the physical components of the house, the quality of spaces and the access to basic services are fundamental components to evaluate the degree of marginalization of population.  ▪ Access to Food ( I A F    ) . Access to nutritious food is necessary. Nevertheless, many people living in poverty conditions do not have enough income to acquire food or do not have a proper feeding.    The Poverty and Marginalization Index (I P   ) is calculated using Eq. (5) , and it is equal to the average of the deficiency indicators described (I E D   , I H S   , I S S   , I C S   , I A F     ). Moreover, each of the indicators is multiplied by a factor that acts as a weight, in this way, the community decision makers or stakeholders can prioritize any of the indicators. The higher the Poverty and Marginalization Index, the higher the degree of poverty.(5) I P  = ( ω E D   · I E D   + ω H S   · I H S   + ω S S   · I S S   + ω C S   · I C S   + ω A F   · I A F   )  · 1  / 5       Deficiency Indicators (I E D   , I H S   , I S S   , I C S   , I A F     ) represent the percentage of people who suffer deprivation of services (j  ). Table 2    shows the main deprivations associated with the evaluated indicators which are calculated as the average of the Deprivation Indicator (Eq. (11 )). In the case of Educational Backwardness Indicator (I E D    ), this can be calculated by Eq. (6) . Here, deprivation considers the scholarships (j = 1   ) than can be given to inhabitants to complete basic education and the implementation of courses (j = 2   ) with the purpose of providing the inhabitants with tools to develop their skills. Therefore, the Educational Backwardness Indicator (I E D    ) is equal to the average of the two deprivation services (j = 1    and j = 2   ):(6) I E D   = ∑ j = 1  2  D e p r i v a t i o n j   2      The indicator for access to health services (I H S    ) is equal to the average of deprivations related to medical staff (j = 3   ) and medical units (j = 4   ):(7) I H S   = ∑ j = 3  4  D e p r i v a t i o n j   2      Medical insurance (j = 5   ) and Pensions (j = 6   ) granted to population are the aspects that can be achieved to improve the Access to Social Security Indicator (I S S    ). The indicator is calculated using Eq. (8) :(8) I S S   = ∑ j = 5  6  D e p r i v a t i o n j   2       Basic Housing Services ( I C S   )    consider the access to water (j = 8   ) and electricity (j = 9   ). In addition, quality of houses is evaluated. In this work, material of floor houses was considered (j = 7   ) due to most of the houses have dirt floor.(9) I C S   = ∑ j = 7  9  D e p r i v a t i o n j   3      The indicator for access to food (I A F    ) is associated to the variety of food (j = 10   ) that inhabitants consume and the nutritional value of food (j = 11   ).(10) I A F   = ∑ j = 10  11  D e p r i v a t i o n j   2       The deprivation indicator (D e p r i v a t i o n j    ) considered in each of the deficiency indicators, can be calculated as the relation of the maximum number of benefits (Y j   ) (e.g. maximum number of scholarships that can be provided) that can be implemented to improve the D e p r i v a t i o n j     minus the number of benefits selected by the model (x j   ) divided by the maximum number of benefits (Y j   ).(11) D e p r i v a t i o n j  = Y j  − x j   Y j       Furthermore, the number of selected benefits or services (x j   ) is determined by the unitary cost of each of the benefits (Ω  j   ). Table S3  presents the costs used for the calculation of the Cost deprivations (C o s t  j   d e p     ).(12) C o s t  j   d e p   = x j  · Ω  j          , ∀ j     In turn, the number of selected benefits (x j   ) is limited by the resulting Profit  obtained in the assessed cases. This means, once the results of the mathematical model for the integration of the WEF nexus are obtained, the Profit  of the system is known, and it is assumed that this available money can be used to invest in programs that help to eradicate poverty. Therefore, the Profit or part of the Profit is fixed as parameter and the model must determine the optimal distribution of economic resources to decrease the Poverty and Marginalization Index:(13) Profit = ∑ j  C o s t  j   d e p        In this way, the optimal distribution of economic recourses for the implementation of benefits was performed minimizing the Poverty and Marginalization Index (I P   ) subject to Eq. (5) –(13) :(14) M i n { I P  }       3.7 Mathematical model This section presents the formulation of a Mixed Integer Linear Programming model for the design of a sustainable system involving the security of the Water-Energy-Food Nexus in Disadvantage Rural Communities (DRC). The primary model equations based on the general superstructure (Fig. 1 ) are presented below. For more detailed information about the mathematical model see the Supplementary Material . 3.7.1 Electricity demand Electricity demand (E t , s  T   ) can be covered by the energy produced in the selected cogeneration units (E  u , t , s     ) and the electricity generated in solar panels (E t , s  S P    ). The electricity produced is distributed to domestic (E t , s  D   ), agriculture (E t , s  A   ) and cattle (E t , s  C   ) sectors as follows:(15) E t , s  S P   + ∑ u  E  u , t , s    = E t , s  D  + E t , s  C  + E t , s  A  ,         ∀ t , ∀ s     (16) E t , s  S P   + ∑ u  E  u , t , s    = E t , s  T  ,         ∀ t , ∀ s     The total electricity demand is determined considering the number of inhabitants (μ s   ) multiplied by a factor corresponding to the electricity consumed per person (e t , s  t o t a l    ):(17) E t , s  T  = μ s  · e t , s  t o t a l   ,         ∀ t , ∀ s       3.7.2 Cogeneration units The proposed model allows selecting the optimal cogeneration units, which are Internal Combustion Engines, Fuel Cells, Microturbines and Stirling Engines. Cogeneration units are capable of simultaneously providing thermal (W u , t , s    ) and electrical energy (E u , t , s    ), the energy produced is calculated based on the efficiency factors (η u   ) as follows:(18) E u , t , s   = η u E  · F u , t , s   ,          ∀ t , ∀ u , ∀ s     (19) W u , t , s   = η u Q  · F u , t , s   ,          ∀ t , ∀ u , ∀ s      The optimal selection of the cogeneration unit is determined by its binary variables (y u   ). If the binary variable is equal to 1, then the cogeneration unit exists. On the other hand, if the binary variable is equal to 0, the cogeneration unit does not exist. The capacity of the cogeneration unit must be greater than the electricity it has to produce, which in turn is restricted by the maximum capacity available in the market (Cap  u   CHP − MAX    ):(20) C a p u C H P   ≥ E u , t , s   ,       ∀ u , ∀ t , ∀ s     (21) C a p u C H P   ≤ Cap  u   CHP − MAX   · y u  ,       ∀ u      The sum of the binary variables of the types of cogeneration units must be equal to one, which means that only one cogeneration unit must be selected.(22) ∑ u  y u  = 1       3.7.3 Water demand The domestic water demand (W t , s  D   ) involves both, cold (W t , s  C W    ) and hot water demands (W t , s  H W    ).(23) W t , s  D  = W t , s  H W   + W t , s  C W   ,       ∀ t , ∀ s      Cold water is equal to the sum of fresh water (W t , s  F D    ) plus rainwater sent to the domestic sector (W t , s  R W − D    ):(24) W t , s  C W   = W t , s  F D   + W t , s  R W − D   ,       ∀ t , ∀ s      Cold and hot water demands are determined by the number of inhabitants (μ s  ·   ), w t , s  c    and w t , s  h    represent the cold and hot water consumed per habitant, respectively:(25) W t , s  C W   = μ s  · w t , s  c  ,         ∀ t , ∀ s     (26) W t , s  H W   = μ s  · w t , s  h  ,         ∀ t , ∀ s     On the other hand, hot water is equal to the sum of the water provided by thermal storage tanks, solar collectors (W t , s  S C    ) and boilers (W t , s  B   ):(27) W t , s  H W   = W t , s  H W S T   + W t , s  S T C   + W t , s  S C   + W t , s  B  ,       ∀ t , ∀ s       3.7.4 Fresh water The total freshwater consumption is equal to the sum of the water sent to the storage tanks, boilers, solar collectors, cogeneration units, and the water sent to domestic, agriculture and livestock sectors:(28) W t , s    =  W t , s  S T   + W t , s  S T C   + W t , s  B  + W t , s  S C        +  ∑ u  W u , t , s   + W t , s  F D   + W t , s  F A   + W t , s  F C   ,        ∀ t , ∀ s          3.7.5 Water required in agriculture Water required in agriculture is equal to the sum of greywater (W t , s  G W − A    ), rainwater (W t , s  R W − A    ) and fresh water (W t , s  F A    ):(29) W t , s  A  = W t , s  G W − A   + W t , s  R W − A   + W t , s  F A   ,       ∀ t , ∀ s      The agricultural water demand (W  t , s    A   ) is determined by the water required by each type of crop, this can be represented by the factor (σ f   ) multiplied by the corresponding crop produced (F o o d f , t , s     ):(30) W  t , s    A  = ∑ f  F o o d f , t , s   · σ f   ,      ∀ t , ∀ s       3.7.6 Water required in cattle The cattle water demand (W t , s  C   ) is covered by the greywater (W t , s  G W − C    ) and fresh water sent to the cattle sector (W t , s  F C    ):(31) W t , s  C  = W t , s  G W − C   + W t , s  F C   ,       ∀ t , ∀ s     Water required in cattle is determined by the water required by each type of animal (σ f , s    ) for its production:(32) W  t , s    C  = ∑ f  F o o d f , t , s   · σ f , s    ,             ∀ t , ∀ s     The manure generated (m t , s    ) by each cow is determined by the factor (χ m a n u r e    ):(33) m t , s   = c o w t , s   · χ m a n u r e   ,             ∀ t , ∀ s      Biogas production is equal to manure multiplied by a factor corresponding to the biogas that can be generated per tonne of manure (χ b i o g a s    ):(34) b i o g a s t , s   = m t , s   · χ b i o g a s   ,             ∀ t , ∀ s       3.7.7 Distribution for solid wastes Municipal solid waste (MSW r = 1 , t   Total   ) is separated in non-recyclable, metals, glass, plastic and paper, where the non-recyclables can be sent to the landfill or to the gasification plant (M S W t , s  G a s     ) or pyrolysis plant (M S W t , s  P y r     ).(35) MSW r = 1 , t   Total  = M S W t , s  G a s   + M S W t , s  P y r   + M S W t , s  L a n d f i l l   ,        ∀ t , ∀ s       3.7.8 Waste to energy technologies: gasification and pyrolysis plants The produced biofuel or value-added product from the Waste to energy technology (f t , s  w t e    ) is calculated as the conversion factor (δ w t e    ) multiplied by the non-recyclable wastes treated in the plant (M S W t , s  w t e     ):(36) f t , s  w t e   = δ w t e   · M S W t , s  w t e   ,          ∀ t , ∀ s     The capacity of the unit must be greater than the solid waste input and less than the maximum capacity for solid wastes treatment (Cap  wte − MAX    ):(37) C a p w t e   ≥ M S W t , s  w t e   ,           ∀ t , ∀ s     (38) C a p w t e   ≤ Cap  wte − MAX   · y w t e         3.7.9 Capital costs Capital costs are constituted by the fixed cost of each of the units (FC  ) multiplied by their binary variables plus the variable cost of each unit (VC  ) multiplied by its capacity or area. This way, for each unit, the corresponding capital cost is determined through Eq. (41) , where χ   corresponds to all the technologies proposed in the model. The total capital cost equals the sum of all capital costs χ  :(39) C C = κ · ∑ χ  F C  χ  · y χ  + V C  χ  ·  c χ         3.7.10 Operating costs The operating cost is equal to the unitary cost of a product or service (UC) multiplied by the flow of such product (X ):(40) O C o s t s  = U C  · ∑ t  X t , s   ,           ∀ s       3.7.11 Total annual cost The total annual cost (T A C s    ) is equal to the total operating cost (T O C s    ) plus the total capital cost (C C   ):(41) T A C s  = C C + T O C s  ,            ∀ s       3.7.12 Sales The unitary sale cost per type of food (US C f    ) multiplied by the production of food (F o o d f , t , s     ) is equal to the total sales of food (S a l e s F s    ):(42) S a l e s F s  = ∑ f  US C f  · ∑ t  F o o d f , t , s     ,                   ∀ s      Similarly, sales are calculated for biofuel, water and energy.  3.7.13 Greenhouse gas emissions Greenhouse gas emissions from the process plants are calculated by multiplying the emission factor associated with each of the process plant by the amount of solid waste treated or biogas:(43) G H G E s   G A S   = γ G A S     · ∑ t  M S W t , s  G A S    ,           ∀ s      In the same way, emissions are calculated for the pyrolysis and anaerobic digestion plants, landfill and for the use of biofuel and natural gas.   3.8 Objective functions in multi-objective approach As mentioned before, creating a sustainable system implies conflicting objectives. For example, it is intended to maximize the profit and social benefits, but water consumption and greenhouse gases must be as small as possible while demands and technical constrains are satisfied. The objective functions considered are stated as follows. 3.8.1 Profit The total profit of the system (P r o f i t   ) is constituted by the sum of the product sales like food, pyrolysis oil, natural gas, biogas, and recyclable products minus the total annual cost (annualized capital cost and operation costs).(44) P r o f i t s    =  S a l e s F s  + S a l e s P y r s  + S a l e s G a s s  + S a l e s A d s       +  S a l e s R P s  − T A C s  ,       ∀ s          3.8.2 Water abstraction The total abstracted water (W a t e r   ) refers to the net water abstraction from groundwater. In this case, (W a t e r   ) is the water abstraction from wells:(45) W a t e r s  = ∑ t  W t , s   ,       ∀ s       3.8.3 Greenhouse gas emissions The greenhouse gas emissions correspond to the emissions of the CHP units and the Waste-to-Energy plants for management municipal solid wastes:(46) G H G E s  = G H G E s C H P   + G H G E s G A S   + G H G E s P Y R   + G H G E s A D   ,       ∀ s       3.8.4 Multi-objective optimization The proposed model corresponds to a Multi-objective optimization problem for achieving the minimization the Abstracted Water and GHGE and the maximization of the Profit simultaneously (OF). (47) O F = { max  P r o f i t , min  W a t e r , min  G H G E }      To solve the MOO problem, the objective function was formulated as the minimization of the sum of the average objectives:(48) M i n  O F = ∑ s  ( G H G E s  + W a t e r s  + P r o f i t s   )   s c e n a r i o s           4 Case study In the last 30 years, economic growth in Mexico has been below its potential (Bank, 2019). Numerous efforts have been implemented to eradicate the extreme poverty and hunger as part of the fulfillment of the Sustainable Development Agenda. Mexico has many communities below poverty accounting for 41.9% of the total population, which represents 52.4 million of people (Table 3  ). Further, 7.4% of population lives in extreme poverty conditions, generally due to its inadequate location that causes lack of basic services, food insecurity, unemployment and natural resource depletion (CONEVAL, 2019 ). This in turn implies that population tends to migrate to urbanized regions, where the inhabitants can have better living conditions. Labor shortages in agricultural and livestock activities are the greatest disadvantage of migration in vulnerable communities that face difficulties in managing social, economic, and environmental conditions. In order to show the applicability of the proposed approach, the community of Cochoapa el Grande, in the Mexican State of Guerrero, was used as case study, this community has the lowest Human Development Index in Mexico (HDI = 0.362) (UNDP, 2014 ) and also it has been determined that 99.3% of population lives in poverty conditions, representing the community with the highest percentage of poverty in the country (CONEVAL, 2019 ). This municipality is in a geographic region constituted mainly of rugged areas, which makes its access difficult. As a result, social lag is presented in most of the population and the access to basic services is minimal. One of the biggest challenges to improve social development is to reduce undernourishment in the inhabitants, since their caloric intake and nutritional requirements is not enough to have a good lifestyle. Then, the proposed approach seeks to managing properly the available resources to provide the water and energy requirements for a better lifestyle. The problem consists in determining the optimal production of different types of vegetal and animal foods to ensure the inhabitants consume the necessary nutrients and sufficient caloric intake. In addition, the selection of technologies that allows to provide the water and energy demanded is presented. The model was solved in a deterministic and stochastic way. For the stochastic approach, a scenario generation based on a Random Sampling method to generate different scenarios with different standard deviations on energy and water demand and population was developed. These parameters can be considered uncertain and are represented as random variables. In probability and statistics, random variables are variables whose value is unknown and are used to quantify outcomes of a random occurrence, therefore, they can take on many values. A random variable has a probability distribution that represents the likelihood that any of the possible values would occur. Based on the historical data, it is possible to obtain statistical parameters such as the mean and standard deviation. It is important to mention that even when historical data is unknow, a good approximation is to use the standard deviation of the available data since there are taken values around a reference point. Therefore, in this case, the normal distribution was used for the scenario generation. On the other hand, to determine the size of the sample to evaluate (n  ) of infinite or unknown population, it is appropriated to use the Cochran formula that allows calculating an ideal sample size given a desired level of precision, desired confidence level, and the estimated proportion of the attribute present in the population:(51) n = Z α 2  · 1 − p · q  i 2       Were Z α    corresponds to the Gauss Distribution, p   is the (estimated) proportion of the population that has the attribute in question, i   is the desired level of precision and q   is equal to 1 − p   . In this work, a confidence level of 99% and a margin error of 10% are used, the prevalence expected of the parameter in case of being unknown is assumed to be 50%. Using these parameters, the ideal sample size to evaluate results corresponds to 166 scenarios. In the next section we present the optimal design system for the DRC with the new selected infrastructure to decrease poverty indicators.  5 Results and discussion The mathematical model corresponds to a scenario-based Stochastic Mixed Integer Linear Problem, and it was implemented in the software GAMS using the solver CPLEX. The deterministic model consists in 1,192 constrains, 14 binary variables and 1,260 continuous variables. On the other hand, the stochastic model consists of 197,924 constrains, 2,324 binary variables and 213,880 continuous variables. In this section, results of the deterministic model are presented to show the benefits to use a stochastic model instead. Then, the results of the stochastic model and the potential benefits in the DRC to reduce the poverty and margination index are presented. 5.1 Deterministic solution The Deterministic Model was solved attending for economic and environmental objectives. Four cases were optimized, i.e., the maximization of Profit (Max Profit), minimization of Abstracted Water (Min Water), minimization of Greenhouse gas emissions (Min GHGE) and minimization of the three objectives simultaneously (Min OF). Table 4   shows the results obtained for the cases mentioned before. Results of the cases consider the optimal solution to satisfy the water, energy and food demands providing the nutrients required for the inhabitants of the municipality. To lustrate the design of the optimized cases,  Fig. 2  is presented. In regard to Max Profit  case, the cogeneration technology selected by the model was the Microturbine, which is capable to cover the electric and thermal energy. Biofuel produced by the treatment of the MSW in the anaerobic digestor and the pyrolysis plant was enough to meet the requirements of the cogeneration technologies without the necessity of the natural gas purchase. In contrast with other cases, this case does not select the existence of rainwater collection systems to cover the water demand, and solar collector was also selected to cover the thermal requirements in the DRC. Regarding the Min GHGE  case, the existence of the rainwater collector helps to minimize the abstracted water. Fuel Cell was selected to provide electricity and thermal energy, the last one was also carried out by installing boilers and solar collectors. On the other hand, MSW were treated in the gasification, pyrolysis, and anaerobic digestion plants, using these technologies, the biofuel and natural gas obtained were used to operate the fuel cell. The minimization of abstracted water (Min Water ) shows a similar configuration, compared to the Min GHGE  case, the difference between these cases is that Min Water  case selects the microturbine as cogeneration technology and natural gas is not required to satisfy the energy requirements. Min OF  presents the case where the Abstracted Water, GHGE and Profit are involved simultaneously in the Objective Function. Despite the fact that in multi-objective optimization problems it is possible to generate a set of cases, in this work we only show the solution of the case where is given the same priority to the objectives (Min OF ); nevertheless, the presented model permits to perform an analysis where different priority is given to the objectives. In the Min OF  case, the cogeneration technology corresponds to the fuel cell and the fuel required by its operation is natural gas or biofuel from the pyrolysis of municipal solid wastes. To cover the thermal energy requirements, solar collectors must be installed. Rainwater collector systems are implemented to satisfy the water demand and decrease the water abstraction. For all the evaluated cases, the water, energy and food demands were completely satisfied, and the design of the cases is suitable to make the community to be self-sufficient through the proper management of the available resources. A representation of the evaluated cases is illustrated in  Fig. 3 .  5.2 Impact of uncertainty To evaluate the impact of the uncertainty on the deterministic problem, three cases were developed with different standard deviation on the uncertain parameters (number of inhabitants, water demand and energy demand) 5%, 10% and 15%, that correspond to OF-5, OF-10, and OF-15, respectively. The developed cases were evaluated under the design of the deterministic model, minimizing simultaneously the economic and environmental objectives (OF) with a sample size of 166 scenarios. It is important to mention that in the multi-objective cases that involve uncertainty, the expected value was minimized. Therefore, OF represents the model where no uncertain parameters were considered and OF-5, OF-10 and OF-15 indicate the cases where the uncertain parameters were introduced with their respective standard deviations. Results for the OF-5, OF-10 and OF-15 cases are reported in Table 5  . As these cases were developed under the same design of the case that does not consider uncertainty (OF), the WEF system was not able to cover the energy and water demands of the population, and it is not able to produce all the food to cover the nutritional requirements that each person needs to have a balanced diet. This indicates that with the possible increment in the population, the community cannot be self-sufficient, and it will present water and energy lack access and therefore, it will require the purchase of external food. In the case of electricity, there is a significant unsatisfied demand of 49% for case OF-5 and 50% for cases OF-10 and OF-15. Hot water demand is covered in the three cases, while cold water presents 4% of unsatisfied demand in case OF-5, 6% in OF-10 and 9% in OF-15. However, the major unsatisfied demand is presented in the food, cases show 70% of unsatisfied demand which indicates that with the production of food in the community, habitants will not be able to have an appropriate diet since the food is not enough to obtain the needed nutrients, and therefore the purchase of food from external markets is necessary. Table 6   presents the food production of the analyzed cases and the purchase of food required to meet the demand. Food production for all the cases shows that it is not suitable to produce animal food and population must follow a vegetarian diet. These results can be attributed to the fact that livestock activities are among the most damaging sectors, which puts water security at risk. Furthermore, livestock activities generate more greenhouse gas emissions that agricultural activities. Also, even when nutrient demand increases, the optimal solution is to purchase vegetables, cereals and fruits with any type of food of animal origin. Results obtained for food production represent the optimal solution to meet the recommended macro-nutrient intake in the population attending economic and environmental objectives. Despite optimal results, changing eating habits in DRC is challenging and may not be feasible. Nonetheless, the necessary restrictions can be made in the proposed model to have a predefined production of products of animal origin. It should be emphasized that population in DRC such as Cochoapa el Grande does not have the privilege of having access to a varied diet, since in this type of community meat is consumed very rarely. Nevertheless, it is possible to achieve a more varied diet including more products to the model or including constraints for the types of food. On the other hand, results for the evaluated cases show that, with an increment in the population, Profit will decrease due to the necessity of purchasing food outside the community, what is more expensive ( Fig. 4 ). Water abstraction will increase to meet the water requirements in the municipality. The contrast between the different cases shows us the importance of including uncertainty in the models, since unwanted events may occur, and it is important to consider such events before implementing the system. The optimization of models under uncertainty allows to analyze the behavior of the system under undesirable events, which can contribute to having a resilient design.  5.3 Stochastic solution As presented in previous section, the selection of the type of technology and their size is important to have a stable system and to fulfill the water, energy and food demands. Considering several scenarios, allows evaluating the performances of the technologies, used raw materials and selected products. In this way, it is possible to select those that can be supplied, even under adverse or unplanned situations. Table 7   shows the results of the deterministic and stochastic models when there are considered the three objectives simultaneously. The profit in the deterministic solution is 10% greater than the stochastic solution; however, using this 10% of profit to modify the size of some units results in a decrease of unsatisfactory demand of 100%. It means that the system can satisfy the demands of water, energy and food in the DRC taking into account variations in the population, which also modifies the solid waste quantity and the wastewater volume.  Fig. 5  shows the configuration of the optimal flowsheet that considers uncertainty. As presented, the selected cogeneration technology is a fuel cell and the fuel required by its operation is a combination between biofuel from the pyrolysis of municipal solid wastes and a natural gas reserve. To cover the thermal energy requirements, solar collectors must be installed. Evenly, rainwater collector systems are installed to satisfy the water demand and minimize the abstracted water.  5.4 Poverty and Marginalization Index Current indicators to calculate the Poverty and Marginalization Index were obtained as well as the conditions in which inhabitants live. Cochoapa el Grande presents high levels of deprivation in most of the sectors:• In terms of Education, the community accounts with Elementary and High Schools, but most of the population did not even finish Elementary School. The average level of education of inhabitants is second grade of Elementary School.  • There are five medical units in the municipality with only 8 doctors in total.  • About 96% of population lacks social security.  • Houses of the town are built with low quality materials.  • More than half of the population has malnutrition.    Current scenario of the community presents a Poverty and Marginalization Index of 80.87 (Table 8  ). According with the deficiencies of the community, it is possible to implement strategies that allows decreasing the Poverty Index. For that, the Profit obtained in each of the cases evaluated in this work can be used to give scholarships to the inhabitants so that they can finish their studies, hire more medical personnel, build medical units, grant medical insurance and pensions, improve the quality of housing spaces and ensure access to water, electricity and foods. In this work, we used the costs used for the calculation of the Cost deprivations presented in Table S3  of the supplementary material. The methodology for calculating the poverty and marginalization index considers different social aspects that the decision maker can prioritize according to their preferences. Similarly, the investment to reduce the poverty can be fixed according to the decision maker. For the presented case study, we consider to use the 25% of the profit obtained in each of the cases ($2,235,200 for the OF, $2,023,600 for the OF-5, $2,014,800 for the OF-10, and $2,006,600 for the OF-15). The position of the current scenario and the results obtained from the deterministic (OF) and the stochastic (SOF-5) cases are presented in Table 8 . As there are not a significant variation in the profit obtained for the cases that contain uncertainty, only the SOF-5 was used to illustrate the change in the Poverty and Marginalization Index. Deprivation indicators and costs for their improvement for all the cases with the different standard deviations are presented in the Supplementary Material (Table S4) . As it was mentioned before, Cochoapa el Grande has the highest level of deprivation in Mexico. Nevertheless, it is possible to reduce the Poverty and Marginalization Index by 18% annually with the implementation of the proposed approach. However, we have demonstrated that the impact of the uncertainty must be considered in the model to satisfy the demands of the population and provide them the best quality of life possible. Therefore, SOF-5 was evaluated and even the results show that the Poverty and Marginalization Index only decreases 8% per year, it is possible to improve basic services for the population. To achieve the enhancements in the quality of life of the inhabitants, the costs that must be destined to the different sectors are presented in Table 9  . Table 9  shows that to improve the Poverty and Marginalization Index, the government must invest in several sectors. For both cases, efforts must be made to implement training courses to improve people skills. Also, investment should be made in improving access to health services, for this, more units must be implemented and more medical personnel must be hired to attend to the needs of the population. On the other hand, access to water, energy and food is covered by the proposed system. It is important to mention that these are the improvements that can be made in a year, nonetheless, for future years, economic resources can be allocated in other areas to decrease the deprivation of the municipality.   6 Conclusions This work has presented a mathematical programming model for the optimal supply of food in a DRC. The model includes a variety of technologies to meet the energy, water, and food demands of the community. In order to cover the energetic requirements, cogeneration systems have been proposed, these technologies are good alternatives to be installed in places where the connection to the electricity grid is difficult. Besides, they have environmental advantages because they use less fuel compared to conventional systems and, therefore, the generation of emissions is lower than the actual system. The model also includes waste-to-energy technologies to produce fuel for energy requirements. Moreover, this model is able to determine the optimal production of food of vegetable and animal origin to meet the essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, proteins, fiber and lipids to decrease malnutrition. The community of Cochoapa el Grande from Mexico was used as an attractive case study due to its limitations and deprivations to basic services. Considering the variation in population due to migration and return, the number of inhabitants of the DRC was taken as uncertain parameter as well as the changing water and energy demand. Three cases with different standard deviations in the uncertain parameters were generated. Results show that it is important to take into account the uncertainty in the model to design properly the system. The model was able to satisfy the water, energy and food demands of the community. Food production to cover the recommended nutritional intake strongly contributes to the profits of the system, which stands out in the economic objective. In addition, an analysis of the calculation of the Poverty and Marginalization Index was included, findings show that with the implementation of the proposed approach the Poverty Index could be reduced 8% per year, indicating that the inhabitants will have a better quality of life and access to essential services and resources progressively.
