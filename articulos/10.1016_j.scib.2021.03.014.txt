The Tibetan Plateau is characterized by extreme weather, harsh environment, and high sensitivity to climate warming and human activities [1] . Once degraded, it is difficult to rehabilitate the ecosystems in this region because of the unique environment. Consequently, alpine grassland ecosystems of the Tibetan Plateau play important roles in regional ecological security and economic development. Nevertheless, alpine grasslands have been experiencing serious degradation owing to the escalating impact of overgrazing and climate change in recent years [2] . Grazing exclusion with fences has been widely adopted to restore degraded grasslands [3] . The effects of fencing on ecosystem processes, as well as the relationships among livestock, wildlife, and humans, are complex [4] . A trade-off between ecological protection and economic development exists [5] ; but fencing can be a useful tool when it is transitional and impermanent [6] . Consequently, studies on a comprehensive and long-term management plan using fences are urgently needed. A previous study suggested that the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) could be used to guide local, regional, and global sustainable development plans [7] . Goal 15 of the SDGs focuses on life on land, and highlights how to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably combat desertification, and halt land degradation and biodiversity loss [8] . Here, we propose that Goal 15 should be used to guide grassland management of the Tibetan Plateau. (1) The state quo of fences across the Tibetan Plateau. Recently, Sun et al. [5]  reported the efficiency of grazing exclusion using fences, and suggested that fences have ecological and environmental benefits; however, long-term fencing may cause species loss [9] , community density decrease, and nutrient value reduction [10]  and is not beneficial for improvement in soil fertility [11] . Furthermore, grazing exclusion with fences redistributes grazing pressure and increases pressure in unfenced areas. Importantly, fencing severely restricts wildlife activity, thereby causing habitat fragmentation, movement disruption, and even isolation, which prevents gene exchange and population optimisation. Many wild animals are trapped and even killed by fences. Moreover, fencing reduces the area available for wildlife, thereby intensifying conflicts between wildlife and human’s livestock, which has led the government to pay large compensation to mitigate human – wildlife conflict. Accidents caused by large carnivores, including animal attacking on humans by black bear, brown bear, snow leopard, wild wolf and wild yak, exist across almost the entire Tibetan Plateau (Fig. 1  a). The accidents occurred most frequently in Zhiduo County of Qinghai Province, with 2587 cases between 2012 and 2017 (Fig. 1 c), and caused a total financial compensation of 7367 thousand CNY (Fig. 1 b). The annual financial compensation and number of annual accidents have increased sharply in recent years (Fig. 1 c). Thus, long-term fencing is detrimental to the sustainable development of alpine grasslands. Positively, fences have been removed in some places recently; however, just like the implementation of the fences, there is no scientific assessment before their removal. Therefore, the development of an appropriate management strategy for grazing exclusion with fences is a matter of urgency. (2) A systematic approach is suitable to manage fences. The classification–coordination–collaboration (3C) systematic approach, proposed by Fu et al. [12] , has been used to reduce the spread of coronavirus 2019 [13] . Here, 3C approach refers to the assignment of objects to groups by considering their properties, grades, and other characteristics (classification), top-down management process (coordination), and use of multiple individuals or organisations that work together to accomplish a task (collaboration), respectively. Therefore, the 3C approach provides a feasible approach to improve the efficiency of grazing exclusion using fences and achieves Goal 15 (life of land) of the SDGs of the Tibetan Plateau, and then accomplishes Goal 1 (no poverty), Goal 2 (zero hungry), Goal 3 (good health and well-being), Goal 4 (quality education) and Goal 13 (climate action). Finally, the Tibetan Plateau will move towards sustainable development (Fig. 2  ). According to the 3C approach (Fig. S1  online), grazing exclusion with fences should be implemented based on the differences in biogeographical patterns, drivers of changes in ecosystems, and resilience and degradation of grasslands. Specifically, it is necessary to understand spatial patterns of vegetation dynamics, climate conditions, and soil properties across the Tibetan Plateau. The effects of climate change (e.g., warming and precipitation regime) and human activities (e.g., grazing and other ecological engineering) should be analysed. In addition, the rehabilitation mechanisms and capacity of different ecosystem types (such as alpine meadow, alpine steppe, and alpine desert steppe) should be clarified. Importantly, the duration and layout of the fencing should depend on the assessment of the degradation mechanism, stages, types, and drivers. All these processes can be classified using a systematic approach. The object of this step is to determine where, when, and how to use grazing exclusion with fences for appropriate grassland maintenance in accordance with the local situation. Coordination is the link between classification and collaboration and is key to accomplish sustainable grassland management. In this step (Fig. S2  online), hierarchical grassland administrative departments need to be established in top-down order. In the Tibetan Plateau, a management model should be constructed from the national level to the levels of the province, district, county, village, and residents (herdsman). The original purpose of grazing exclusion with fences is to coordinate economic development and ecological protection. Nevertheless, with the increased duration of grazing exclusion, many problems and contradictions are emerging. The conflict between forage and livestock has been identified as the major problem of sustainable development in grassland-livestock systems [14] . According to the classification, the relationships between fencing and wildlife areas must be coordinated to alleviate the conflict between humans and animals. In addition, fencing and grazing areas need to be balanced for ecological protection and vegetation production. Furthermore, ecological compensation and areas where grazing is forbidden must be considered to maintain the livelihood of herdsmen and promote human well-being. We propose that traditional free grazing is adoptable in order to maintain or resume traditional grazing practices and culture if the grasslands have not been degraded; however, free grazing should be implemented with cautious in severely overgrazed areas where fencing is necessary. Essentially, all issues can be overcome by the coordination of production, livelihoods, and ecology. Collaboration can guarantee the achievement of the SDGs in the alpine grassland (Fig. S3  online). For this, clear distinctions must be drawn among departments, their functions should be integrated, and the collaborations of different administrative departments, such as the Forestry and Grassland Administration, Bureau of Ecology and Environment, Bureau of Natural Resources, and Finance Bureau, must be strengthened to promote both ecological protection and economic development. The collaboration should be formed at different levels of the administrative departments. Strengthening the collaborations among different administrative departments and at different levels within departments could solve the fence management problems timely, flexibly, and effectively. The policymaker–performer–evaluator process should be enhanced. In detail, the policymaker (administrative departments using the top-down approach) should develop and adjust a guidance framework for grazing exclusion with fences according to the assessment of evaluators (e.g., scientists and journalists) about the efficiency of fences and the feedback of performers (herdsmen) [5] . Importantly, evaluators must be independent. The objective of tripartite collaboration is to ensure that the duration and distribution of grazing exclusion with fences agree with the variation of the ecosystem under climate change and human activities. Collaboration between the economy, science and technology (S&T), and culture is an important part [12] . For sustainable grassland utilisation, data on the incomes of herdsmen, degree of S&T development, and practices of the traditional nomadic culture should be synthesised to optimize the duration and distribution of grazing exclusion with fences. Additionally, the economy, S&T, and culture are comprehensive expressions of local strength, which is fundamental to realise SDGs. Among the 17 SDGs approved by the United Nations in 2015, Goal 15 is specifically set for natural habitats and biodiversity, and Goal 1, 2, 3, 4, and 13 are closely linked to this Goal. Goal 15, the progress towards which lags behind that of other SDGs, should be prioritised in China [15] . Grazing exclusion is a core policy instrument applied by governments to rehabilitate degraded grasslands and improve natural habitats. Grassland and livestock are the basis of a herdsman’s life in the Tibetan Plateau. If Goal 15 is achieved, then other goals, such as the elimination of hunger, increase in well-being, promotion of quality education, and adaption to and mitigation of climate change, will be easier to achieve. Thus, all 17 goals can be gradually achieved to ensure the sustainable development of alpine grassland in the Tibetan Plateau. (3) Towards Goal 15 of the SDGs in the Tibetan Plateau. Climate change and anthropogenic activities are the principal causes of alpine grassland degradation across the Tibetan Plateau. Grazing exclusion with fences, the main strategy for grassland restoration, has been adopted across the whole alpine grassland. Consequently, the solution of the issues with grazing exclusion with fences is the foundation to achieve Goal 15 of the SDGs. In detail, the “classification–coordination–collaboration” approach should be used to optimize management as follows: (i) Grazing exclusion with fences should be carried out in accordance with local conditions. According to requirement of classification, fence management should be based on the biogeographical pattern of the Tibetan Plateau. In addition, different types of alpine grassland ecosystem should be considered because different ecosystems have different levels of resilience in response to disturbance or damage. For instance, there is difference in precipitation between alpine meadow (about 700 mm annual mean precipitation in Zoige area) and alpine desert steppe (about 100 mm annual mean precipitation in Ngari Prefecture); thus, grazing exclusion using fence can be more efficiently and quickly in restoring the degraded grassland in Zoige area than that in Ngari Prefecture. More importantly, we should discriminate the health status of grassland, and then confirm the location of fencing. Specifically, fences must be removed in healthy alpine grassland ecosystems. After the removal of fences, traditional moderate grazing is encouraged, which can improve soil fertility, promote diversity, and increase community productivity. Additionally, the enlarged habitat of wild animals can form a stable food chain, reduce human–wildlife conflict, enhance the gene exchange of wild animals, and maintain community stability. Degraded grassland must be fenced. If the fence in a degraded area is removed, the degradation will worsen. Furthermore, it is necessary to distinguish fence layout by fully considering wildlife habitats and corridors, the scope and boundaries of nature reserves and national parks, as well as pasture for ecological protection and economic benefit. For instance, how to define the boundaries of National Nature Reserve of Three Rivers Source, Qilian Mountain National Park, Qiangtang Nature Reserve, and other nature reserve is closely linked to the land of life in the Tibetan Plateau. (ii) A long-standing assessment is needed to coordinate dynamic equilibrium of production, livelihoods, and ecology. To track the real-time status of grassland recovery and determine the suitable time to cease fencing, it is necessary to build a three-dimensional monitoring and evaluation system that consists of a satellite, unmanned aerial vehicle, and a ground investigation team and establish a high-quality database of long-term fence projects. The Alpine Fence Observation Net (AFON) was established in 2020, which contains 40 observed fencing sites in alpine meadow, alpine steppe and alpine desert steppe across the Tibetan Plateau. We intend to provide a scientific solution of trade-off between fencing and grazing, grassland production and livestock, as well as ecological compensation and grazing forbidden, and to regulate the various elements in alpine sustainable grassland development via long-term monitoring. Essentially, a long-standing assessment can give basis for coordinate dynamic equilibrium of production, livelihoods, and ecology. (iii) The collaboration of policymaker–performer–evaluator is the cornerstone of sustainable grassland management. Sustainable grassland management should fully consider the collaborations of different administrative departments, policymaker–performer–evaluator, and economy-science-technology-culture. In 2018, China’s government institutional reform is believed to be a sign of enhanced multiple departments collaboration. For instance, National Forestry and Grassland Administration of the People’s Republic of China was created; in addition, there was a major change with the creation of the Ministry of Ecological Environment of the People’s Republic of China, which is fully responsible for the guidance, collaborations, implementation, and supervision of China’s environmental problems. However, we have not set up a tripartite evaluation (policymaker–performer–evaluator) mechanism of grassland management till now. It is still a challenge to objectively guide grassland management, strengthen collaboration of administrative departments, and optimize economy, economy-science-technology, and culture without the tripartite assessment. Consequently, the collaboration of policymaker–performer–evaluator is the cornerstone of sustainable grassland management.
