                  Governments are facing mounting pressure to ‘do something on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14’. The SDG 14 comprises targets and indicators for countries to show progress in achieving conservation and sustainable use of oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. One novel approach experiencing traction in improving growth performance of marine resource sectors — particularly marine biotechnology and fisheries — is open innovation. This review assesses the potential impacts of using open innovation approaches more widely with good governance principles to promote sustainable management of marine resource use.
                  Recent research filled the gap in creating a quantitative marine open innovation measure to monitor and manage marine sector innovation process. Prior 2018, formulation of marine policies — aimed at building economic prosperity from sustainable use of marine environments — were constrained by the absence of a tool to provide an index to compare marine sectors’ innovation performance. This review highlights a need to broaden the measures used to determine marine management effectiveness especially in the context of achieving the SDGs. Governments are urged to pay more attention to new governance tools including open innovation when formulating new policy aimed at building future scenarios of economic resilience involving marine resource use.

Introduction Oceans comprise over 90% of earth’s habitable space and endemic phyla. Evidence for the 6th mass extinction [1 ] influenced the United Nations to hold its first Ocean Conference in 2017 [2 ]. This was in response to documented declines in fauna and flora. Simultaneously, concern was rising about the extent of undocumented declines in the vast under sampled ocean and risks to the future health of our planet including species redistribution [3 ]. Reconciling use of oceans, seas and marine resources, with conservation goals and livelihood dependency, is at the heart of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14 — life below water [4 ]. In 2015, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) agreed to implement a global strategic plan comprising 17 SDGs. The aim was to bring governments, industry, researchers and non-government representatives together to agree priority actions for achieving the SDG’s 169 targets. While a vast volume of literature is building on how governments can meet the targets outlined in the SDGs, considerable debate continues around implementing actions to balance the relationship between marine resource management effectiveness and governance efficacy. This is in part because of the difficulty in attributing social and economic impacts beyond proximate drivers [5 ] to specific marine environmental management interventions including marine protected areas (MPAs) [6 ]. Many Nations’ main marine resource strategy for our seas and oceans has been to manage the natural environment separately to fisheries. This creates a lack of join-up between Ministerial departments tasked to protect the natural environment with those responsible for job creation and marine industry development. This can lead to a fragmented approach to marine management. Approaches are diverse, including top down management involving government-controlled MPAs [7 ] for conserving biodiversity to informal governance systems, such as territorial user rights for fisheries. This paper reviews efficacy in marine resource governance using fisheries and MPAs as case study themes, against a background of institutional and political challenges in meeting the SDGs. Future research in marine open innovation [8 ,9 ] is recommended to demonstrate wider benefits associated with effective engagement of governments with universities and industry, in co-development of marine policy that is fit to support marine management goals. The author’s practical experience as a Chief Scientific Advisor for the UK and overseas governments, is combined with current opinions in participatory governance reviewed from published literature. For the first time, the potential for adopting open innovation approaches to improve marine governance and accelerate meeting the targets for SDG 14 — life below water — is described [8 ,9 ]. The paper begins with an introduction and review on the concept of open innovation and its application to growing marine resource sectors. Fisheries is described as a traditional sector to illustrate the institutional and political challenges governments face in meeting the SDGs. It then explains the issues and difficulty in reconciling conservation goals using marine protected areas with sustainable fisher livelihoods and building marine industries. The implications of the review findings for policy makers, managers and researchers are set out in the conclusions.  The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and open innovation This section reviews contemporary literature in the context of rethinking how marine resource governance — using open innovation — can assist governments facing mounting pressure to ‘do something on SDG 14’. In a world of nine billion people and a widening income gap between the rich and poor, many maritime nations are looking for new ways to develop strategies to meet the SDGs and improve the quality of people’s lives. An emerging approach for developing marine knowledge-based economies is open innovation [8 ,9 ]. The concept of open innovation was introduced in 2003 [10 ], and for the first time, used in 2015 [8 ] to develop policy to enhance competitiveness in the global market of the marine biotechnology sector [9 ]. Open innovation can be deﬁned as ‘the use of purposive inﬂows and outﬂows of knowledge to accelerate internal innovation, and expand the markets for external use of innovation, respectively’ [11 ]. In other words, open innovation is a strategy by which organizations allow knowledge to flow across their boundaries to enhance their capability to innovate [12 ]. A major challenge for governments is obtaining evidence-based decisions on which marine resource sectors should be prioritised for investment programmes to strengthen the national economy. The absence of a quantitative measure to monitor and manage marine sector innovation process has constrained formulation of marine policies aimed at building economic prosperity [8 ]. In 2018, a newly created measure of inbound open innovation was developed, validated and applied to the marine bio-industry sector of Oman [9 ]. This new metric received positive feedback from managers and policy advisers as a valuable tool in providing an index to compare performance of different marine sectors [9 ]. Open innovation is gaining momentum as a strategic tool to develop marine resources sectors which should, in time, help to diversify a country's economy [8 ]. This is especially important to developing countries that rely on traditionally low-tech marine industry dependent on vulnerable marine resources such as fisheries. Although ﬁsheries can be important for domestic and export markets thus acting as a major source of foreign currency, the ﬁnancial beneﬁts of these exports is commonly low since they consist largely of fresh unprocessed ﬁsh with no added value [13 ]. However, introducing collaboration strategies such as open innovation at the local and national business levels, can oﬀ ;er beneficial opportunities for development. This can vary from traditional marine resource industries sourcing new seafood to marine sectors built on added-value products, for example, high-end niche-value aquaculture (e.g. sea cucumbers [14 ]), functional food, neutraceuticals, cosmetics and healthcare [15 ,16 ]. One of the success factors for the aquaculture industry is its collaboration with the marine biotechnology sector such as vaccine producing companies, ﬁsh-feed development ﬁrms, marine management operations and ﬁsh breeding units [17 ]. Karlsen et al.  [18 ] explained that in Norway, collaboration between universities and vaccine producing marine biotechnology companies has radically reduced the incidence of disease in ﬁsh farming. Similarly, in New Zealand, effective linkages between ﬁsheries companies and chemical companies led to the extraction of bioactive compounds from marine organisms for commercial use, a good example of which is Lyprinol, an anti-inﬂammatory extracted from the New Zealand Green-Lipped Mussel (Perna canaliculus ) [16 ,19 ]. Development of the open innovation measurement tool in Oman [9 ] is helping the government to make informed decisions about policy support needed to drive investment strategies for more effective national economic growth through strengthening the marine biotechnology sector. This reflected the government’s increasing awareness about marine organisms being more diverse, unique and complex in their biophysical, chemical and genetic characteristics than terrestrial organisms [20 ]. Recent scientiﬁc and technological developments in marine biology, has produced many new discoveries [21 ], leading to the emergence of new marine biotechnology sectors, all of which depend on open innovation for their successful development [15 ,16 ,18 ,20 ,22 ,23 ]. A key contemporary consideration for maritime countries when deciding which marine sectors should be selected for investment and growth, is do they have the potential to meet the targets of the SDGs? In order to realize these goals, governments need to provide the institutional and political environments that support open innovation in old and new marine sectors. In a turbulent and uncertain climate, innovation is considered a risky business [11 ,12 ] yet many nations believe open innovation approaches offer a way forward in addressing the grand global challenges of population health, food and energy security [8 ,9 ]. While a vast volume of literature is building on how governments can realise the targets outlined in SDG2 (end hunger, achieve food security and improve nutrition); SDG3 (ensure healthy lives and promote well-being), and; SDG8 (promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth), considerable debate continues around marine resource management effectiveness and governance efficacy. This is in part because of the difficulty in attributing social and economic impacts to specific marine environmental management interventions including MPAs [7 ] and fisheries measures [24•  ], such as fishing bans [25 ].  Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) One methodological aspect in marine conservation efforts that deserves more attention is the set-up of effective participation from a wide range of interest groups to understand how MPAs will impact the social characteristics of their marine resource activity and their coastal community more broadly [26••  ]. Traditionally, scholarly studies on MPAs focussed mostly on gaining an understanding about the environmental and economic variables that can affect the success of an MPA [6 ]. An increasing number of authors around the world are questioning what a successful MPA is in practice especially in relation to how MPAs impact those people mostly affected by its implementation [6 ,7 ,27 ,28 ]. Despite growing evidence to show engagement of natural resource users is linked with support for marine management [29••  ,30 ] participatory marine resource governance should be promoted better by governments to improve buy-in from those targeted [25 ,26••  ]. This is especially true in relation to policy development to support how best MPAs can achieve the targets of SDG 14. Thus I argue that the SDG 14 will not be achieved in practice by the 2030 deadline nor maintained in the longer term until governments rethink their approaches to marine resource governance. This review recommends governments explore the adoption of open innovation approaches [8 ] to help accelerate growth in traditional and new marine resource sectors [9 ] as a way to increase likelihood of meeting the targets set out in the SDG 14. To improve the management of marine resources we need to better integrate social science survey data into marine policy by involving coastal communities through improved participatory governance [31 ]. Methods that take account of information beyond proximate drivers can provide a more detailed understanding of the local context to better inform the policy needs [5 ]. In particular, using governance methods to co-develop management decisions impacting future livelihoods, well-being and quality of life [25 ]. However, the relationship between data generated from the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), poor ocean monitoring and social science evidence is unclear. Therefore, to fully evaluate the potential benefits of MPAs to wider society in the context of marine environmental carrying capacity, there needs to be greater involvement of social scientists in participatory governance forums to evaluate marine resource management outcomes using GOOS and future scenario predictive models. Advances in measuring peoples’ perceived proximate drivers (e.g. fewer fish) to include linkages with ultimate drivers (e.g. poor governance leading to poaching) [5 ] of MPA efficacy over time, would benefit from a new module of GOOS to help tailor-specific management action required to tackle an identified issue. The Large Marine Ecosystems Governance Toolkit [32 ] launched in 2018, makes a start in bringing together experts to share lessons learned in developing an integrated, collaborative approach to ocean and coastal management. The SDG target 14.5 which states, ‘conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information’ continues to influence scholarly debates on the pros and cons of MPAs [26••  ,33 ,34–37 ]. To progress the SDGs in coastal communities, governments need to improve multi-level governance to support marine resource management effectiveness. Why? Nations worldwide are prioritising management options, primarily the set-up of MPAs for oceans, without effective engagement of those impacted. This is especially at the initial design and evaluation stages. Countries weak in engaging people in marine resource management decision-making generally have poor coastal governance [30 ], which is linked to non-compliance of MPA regulations [7 ,27 ,28 ]. I argue governments need to better integrate scientific evidence on social indicators [38 ] in decision-making about MPA design and location. The global focus on increasing the number and size of MPAs to enhance environmental biodiversity is failing to fully capture important unintended social (e.g. poaching) and economic (e.g. loss of income) consequences. This can lead to ‘marine paper parks’ where regulations are not enforced and people break MPA rules [7 ,27 ,28 ]. The MPA amounts to no more than words on paper. Over time a lack of confidence in marine management is created with locals disengaging with the goals of the MPA. Few recent journal articles describe the social impacts of MPAs on coastal communities [39 ,40 ], however, growing evidence for linking MPA efficacy with effective governance mechanisms is emerging [6 ,41–44 ,45•  ,46 ,47 ]. Restricting access to marine resources which provide food or income without consideration of alternatives or transitional livelihood arrangements contributes to conflict over use of contested marine space [48 ,49 ]. Mitigating negative impacts of MPAs on people has received insufficient consideration given the proposed rate at which governments are setting-up MPAs to meet the targets of SDG 14.5. This paper highlights the need and opportunity to improve participatory governance through effective engagement of local people in the decision-making process of marine management options such as MPAs [6 ,26••  ,27 ]. Failure to achieve participation of people in management decisions can build a growing divergence between those prioritising marine conservation goals and others prioritising, for example, food security resilience from the same marine resources. When MPAs impact negatively on sustainability of coastal livelihoods and in the absence of alternative ways to source food and generate cash, rule-breaking of MPAs is common [6 ,7 ,27 ]. The next section briefly reviews the role of Integrated Coastal Zone Management in promoting effective engagement of local people in the marine planning process which can mitigate rule-breaking [31 ,50 ].  Marine planning and integrated coastal zone management Although Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) is a well-established concept its application to the rapid development of MPAs globally, which promotes horizontal (e.g. sectors) and vertical (e.g. local versus national) ‘join-up’ of decision-making on marine resource management matters, is arguably overlooked [51–53 ]. This is despite introduction of marine spatial planning (MSP) statutory approaches in some regions, for example, Europe, which is built on ICZM principles [50 ]. Part of the problem is that stakeholder participation exercises [54 ] and communication is frequently done as consultation which is not the same as effective engagement [29••  ]. ICZM emphasises the benefits associated with effectively involving people in the marine management decision-making cycle. MPA supporters heralded MSP as a way to overcome the policy vacuum associated with earlier forms of ICZM albeit the latter placed a greater emphasis on implementing good governance processes using a principle-based approach [52 ] to underpin effective engagement. The advantage of using principles when developing good governance for deciding on the type of natural resource management, is the choice of principles can match values of local peoples’ cultures. These in turn when translated to human behavioural traits can be used to tailor the context to help explain the importance of MPA rules to those affected by their introduction. With growing awareness of implications for gaps in social science data constraining governments in achieving the SDG 14 targets by 2030, policy makers are advised to better integrate socio-economic scientific evidence with marine environmental data to improve relevance to local contexts. This should be approached using participatory governance (SDG 16.7) forums relevant in engaging locals impacted by proposed introductions of MPAs. A major constraint to governments realising their full potential in contributing positively to the SDGs in many parts of the world, is over reliance on incomplete environmental datasets. This ‘patchiness’ could be improved through combining local ecological knowledge [36 ] to fill in gaps where trends can be determined through existing datasets like GOOS. Comprehensive scientific information, especially longitudinal data on sea bed habitats is frequently limited or unavailable. Despite this shortfall in evidence, marine policy decisions on natural resource use remain biased towards using environmental evidence to influence who has preferential access to marine areas. This is undertaken more reactively than proactively, that is, an environmental impact assessment or similar is done as part of the decision-making as to whether a licence or access will be granted for a particular use or activity of a marine area. What is often lacking is robust and systematically collected evidence on the health and status of the marine environment over spatial and temporal scales where natural versus anthropogenic impacts can be considered well before any plans to disrupt marine areas occurs. Without confidence in the historical trend analysis for likely impacts to the marine ecosystem, which terrestrial ecosystems more commonly have information, then predicting the pros and cons of an MPA can be limited in terms of future forecasting and future scenario planning. Some countries like the Seychelles are thus looking for new ways to inform their decision making on priority use of marine resources to underpin national economic prosperity and have embraced the concept of the Blue Economy, the subject of the next section.  Blue growth economy and fisheries The development of the Blue Growth Strategy [55 ,56 ] has led to many governments approaching the SDG 14 by identifying initiatives aimed at increasing economic prosperity using the contested ‘blue economy’ concept [56 ]. This is especially in relation to reducing dependence on fisheries [57 ,58 ]. To illustrate, the Seychelles has adopted Blue Bonds to generate financial support — including ca. US$20million from the World Bank — to preserve its natural capital, by expanding its offshore MPAs and improving fisheries governance [59 ]. The author was tasked to lead a team of international scientists in 2015 to advise the Seychelles Government about the risks associated with introducing a marine aquaculture sector in connection with its Blue Economy Strategy. The rationale being a way for the Seychelles to diversity sourcing protein away from heavy dependence on its marine capture fisheries sector. This was aimed at improving marine food security through development of a new aquaculture sector, thus reducing vulnerability to over exploited fish stocks and decreasing reliance on its fisheries export trade for income. Lessons learnt from traditional fisheries management approaches in prioritizing economic objectives (e.g. species value) over environmental dimensions (e.g. stock size) are better balanced with consideration of social impacts in contemporary fisheries governance [25 ,31 ]. Governments have used MPAs in their various guises, especially as tools to enhance biodiversity or as fishing bans [6 ]. When fishing is allowed in an MPA and data is available, fishing effort control measures such as catch limits are commonly based on the maximum sustainable yield (MSY). This is used as a reference point for advising on the amount of fishing allowed (quotas) and maintaining healthy stock levels (avoiding over fishing). In data poor fishery-dependent countries such as those in the tropics, MPAs are sometimes used as a banning measure to ensure zero catch or to restrict access to marine fishery resources [27 ]. The science base underpinning decisions about determining MSY-effort (where catches peak), rely mostly on ecological indicators (e.g. abundance, distribution, life history strategy and stock size). The tropics are characterised by mixed-fisheries and limited technical capacity to collect robust scientific fishery evidence [13 ]. Hence the popularity of MPAs in tackling declining fishery resources is often seen as an easier solution to manage fishers, that is, restrict access rather than rely on comprehensive ecological datasets to determine catch quotas. More recently, governments are turning to the economic value of marine resources to inform management decisions. Nonetheless, lessons from the fisheries sector [60 ] should be considered in terms of SDG target 14.5 in whether achieving this can make a difference to ocean health and peoples’ associated livelihoods. Economic fishery data has traditionally been used to show the value of a particular marine resource, for example, the Spiny lobster (Panulirus argus ) fishery in the Turks and Caicos Islands was valued at 10% of the GDP [61 ]. Despite efforts to apply Maximum Economic Yield (MEY) models over MSY, Christensen [62 ] showed MEY to be misleading. This was due to MEY not capturing wider societal benefits beyond biological (e.g. source of food) and economic (e.g. income) aspects of a fishery. Christensen [62 ] concluded MEY excludes the governance culture in which decisions are made locally about who has the right to fish what, when and where. More recent research claims bioeconomic models when combined with multiple management approaches can help policy makers to better understand trade-offs between food provision, fishery profits and fish biomass in the sea [24•  ,63 ,64 ,65•  ]. Understanding marine resource governance mechanisms in diverse contexts [66–68 ] and at different local, national and international levels (SDG 16.7) will facilitate integration of scientific bioeconomic evidence with societal priorities [69•  ]. In some coastal fishing nations, informal governance mechanisms prevail, for example, qoliqoli systems in Fiji [70 ] and prefecture systems in Japan [71 ].  Conclusions and future directions Against the popularity of growing MPAs worldwide [6 ,72 ] as the preferred approach to meeting the targets of SDG 14, this review advises caution. Governments are recommended to evaluate the lessons learned from the marine fisheries sector. In particular, this paper highlights the limitations in focussing on environmental and economic goals in designing marine policy to develop sustainable management options and recommends wider consideration of open innovation as a way to enhance growth performance of old and new marine resource sectors [8 ,9 ]. Although 94% of MPAs allow fishing [73 ], in scenarios where fishing is not compatible with conservation goals fishing is commonly prohibited, referred to as No Take Zones. However, as reported by Christensen [62 ], fishers and their associated coastal communities may seek wider benefits from marine resource use, for example, food security, employment, local control and the right to continue traditional cultural activities. Thus in developing MPAs it is important governments collect robust scientific data on society’s interests as a whole that go beyond bio-economic models [74 ]. Furthermore, if fishing bans are being implemented there needs to be transitional arrangements put in place before this happens to allow those impacted time to adjust. Failure to consider alternative or supplementary livelihood options can lead to poverty (SDG 1) and hunger (SDG 2) in vulnerable coastal communities. If MPAs are to contribute positively to the SDG 14 targets, governments are encouraged to be creative about involving community members including fishers and/or those likely to be impacted in their design [66 ,75–77 ]. This can best be achieved through employing responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels (local, national and international) — SDG target 16.7. The digital revolution offers a variety of new ways to improve understanding of the relationship between participation and effective engagement of stakeholders to improve marine resource governance. Importantly governance mechanisms designed to foster engagement of locals must take account of local decision-making culture which can be more informal (e.g. codes of conduct, self-regulation) than formal (regulations). The relationship between efficacy of MPAs and sustainable fisheries is equivocal in many parts of the world despite the huge investment made by some countries in starting MPAs [78 ]. A greater understanding of the links between locals’ perceptions and compliance for MPA rules such as fishing bans would go some way to addressing how effective MPAs are as a fisheries or broader conservation tool [7 ,27 ,79 ]. The inclusion of social science data will help to enhance knowledge about the marine resource management options likely to be supported by those targeted. Effective multi-level governance (SDG 16.7) is key to achieving the targets outlined in SDG 14. Participatory governance processes that promote meaningful engagement of locals [80 ] with decision-makers [29••  ,30 ] should be applied more widely in future marine resource management scenario planning. Combining this approach with data on proximate and ultimate drivers underpinning human behaviour will help build context-specific management measures to achieve the targets outlined in SDG 14 [5 ] in relevant cultural contexts. Perhaps the biggest constraint to achieving the full suite of benefits that could arise from translating SDG 14 theory into practice is a lack of interdisciplinary [81 ] marine governance expertise on SDG processes. This review recommends financial capacity is increased for training and capacity needs of developing tomorrows ocean leaders. Rethinking marine resource governance approaches including the wider use of open innovation to tackle the SDGs, especially number 14, will require an interdisciplinary licence to be bold and creative. This could be the decade scientists work more closely with governments and industry to co-implement marine sustainable management with those impacted being at the heart of decision-making so there are enough marine resources for all, forever.

The study shows traditional bioeconomic approaches used in fisheries management to shape reform plans can be improved if explicit consideration of equitable outcomes for individuals is considered. This is so losses associated with the burden of reform can be shared more equally among fishers.   25 O.R. Young  D.G. Webster  M.E. Cox  J. Raakjær  L.Ø Blaxekjær  E. Einarsson  R.A. Virginia  J.

This is recognising the gap for a global outlook as earlier research has focussed on the theoretical and local-scale context of MPA efficacy in achieving conservation goals. Staffing and financial capacity were concluded to be the most influential factors on informing how MPA management impacts conservation outcomes. The methodological approach highlights potential for future marine management options to be evaluated in the same way to predict effectiveness in supporting governments in reaching UN SDG 14 targets.   27 A.M.

The authors highlight the UN SDGs separate marine and terrestrial food production sectors which are often reflected in government departments and policy divisions. A case is made for policy makers to better integrate marine and terrestrial food production sectors by considering trade-offs between the SDGs when deciding management and conservation actions for different local contexts.   66 A.M.
