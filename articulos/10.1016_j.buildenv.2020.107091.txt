                  Efficient and productive buildings are considered a key factor in sustainable cities, and they can contribute to achieving regional and national Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this context, green buildings (GBs) have been constructed widely and rapidly, and green building rating tools (GBRTs) have played a considerable role in this process. However, the specific contribution of GBs to the 17 SDGs remains unclear. This study proposed a realistic mapping tool using GBRTs as the medium for evaluating the contribution of GBs to the SDGs. It then quantitatively analyzed this contribution using the analytic hierarchy process. Results showed that SDGs 3, 7, 11 and 12 are highly supported by GBRTs, and SDG 12 benefits the most. Meanwhile, SDG Target 7.3 is the most prominent because it provides the most important channel for GBRT contribution to the SDGs. Lastly, an actual case was used to demonstrate the identification system that integrates important information, including GBs' contribution to the SDGs. Furthermore, two effective methods for improving GBs’ contribution to the SDGs were proposed. This study presents an important practical tool that can scientifically quantify the contribution of GBs to the SDGs and provide the public with transparent and reliable information regarding the path and scope of this contribution.

Efficient and productive buildings are considered a key factor in sustainable cities, and they can contribute to achieving regional and national Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this context, green buildings (GBs) have been constructed widely and rapidly, and green building rating tools (GBRTs) have played a considerable role in this process. However, the specific contribution of GBs to the 17 SDGs remains unclear. This study proposed a realistic mapping tool using GBRTs as the medium for evaluating the contribution of GBs to the SDGs. It then quantitatively analyzed this contribution using the analytic hierarchy process. Results showed that SDGs 3, 7, 11 and 12 are highly supported by GBRTs, and SDG 12 benefits the most. Meanwhile, SDG Target 7.3 is the most prominent because it provides the most important channel for GBRT contribution to the SDGs. Lastly, an actual case was used to demonstrate the identification system that integrates important information, including GBs' contribution to the SDGs. Furthermore, two effective methods for improving GBs’ contribution to the SDGs were proposed. This study presents an important practical tool that can scientifically quantify the contribution of GBs to the SDGs and provide the public with transparent and reliable information regarding the path and scope of this contribution.

The 2030 Agenda sets a framework that has been recognised and adopted by the majority of countries worldwide. This framework includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as described in Tables 1   and 169 Targets [1 ]. The SDGs provide a clear comprehensive framework towards the achievement of global sustainability for the next decade [2 ]. The SDG Summit held in September 2019 at the UN Headquarters in New York reiterated the commitment of its member countries to achieve the 2030 Agenda for the SDGs. In accordance with the 2030 Agenda, many countries have developed responsive sustainable development strategies based on their specific requirements [3 ]. The activities of the construction industry are closely related to the realization of the SDGs [4 ,5 ], considering that this sector has contributed to the growth of the economy but at the cost of considerable resource consumption and environmental issues that undermine the global ecology [6 ]. Meanwhile, the concepts of ‘sustainable building’ (SB) and ‘green building’ (GB) have been developed rapidly at the global scale, demonstrating positive actions by the construction industry to innovate and develop SB solutions to meet the challenges of the present time [7 ]. 1.1 Definition of GB Although the concepts of SB and GB are related and frequently used interchangeably, they are not identical [8 ,9 ]. The former pays more attention to economic and social sustainability than the latter, which is primarily concerned with the impact of buildings on the environment [10 ]. Furthermore, GB has multiple definitions, most of which emphasise its requirements in terms of resource conservation, ecological protection and pollution reduction in each phase of building [11–13 ]. On this basis, GB is defined by this study as an important and widely accepted concept, which aims to promote the sustainable implementation of buildings in their life cycle and focuses on improving the environmental performance of buildings.  1.2 Green building rating tools (GBRTs) and their contribution to the SDGs GBRTs are practical tools for assessing the sustainability performance of buildings by scoring and ranking them on the basis of their responsiveness to different sustainable requirements [14 ,15 ]. GBRTs have been specifically developed by many countries and regions on the basis of local geography, climate and cultural characteristics [16 ,17 ]. At present, hundreds of different GBRTs are believed to be used worldwide after these tools experienced a period of rapid development in the early 21st century and became extremely popular [16–18 ]. Considering that numerous buildings have been certified by GBRTs, these tools have played a major role in accelerating the sustainable transformation of the construction industry, which is an important sector involved in the SDGs [15 ,19 ]. With the advantages of user-friendliness and ease of use, GBRTs have also exerted considerable effort to achieve the SDGs in the construction industry by proposing an effective evaluation framework and an incentive implementation strategy [14 ,19 ].  1.3 Research significance and goals Understanding the relationship between the SDGs and specific sectors, such as the construction industry, is essential for policy development and public awareness [20 ]. It is imperative to develop approaches to transform the SDGs from the global level to the local and specific-projects level [21 ]. However, the evaluation results from the GBRT only represent the “greenness” degree of a particular building and lack information directly related to the SDGs. The current significant decoupling between the sustainable performance of a building and SDGs has led to a lack of knowledge about the contribution of GB to the SDGs. This study will focus on how GB can help achieve the SDGs and close the gap between them. The contribution of GB to the SDGs will be measured and quantified, and the contribution value (CV) will be explained in an intuitive way, which will be beneficial to the development of GB and the realization of the SDGs.   2 Literature review Since the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development came into effect in late 2015, the number of related publications has continued to increase, and most of them focus on the SDGs and their Targets [22–24 ]. Currently, some studies have been conducted on GB and the SDGs, and they can be divided into three main types as shown in Table 2  . Type 1 studies are related to research on the relevance of specific building performance, or building materials, on SDGs. For example, Alawneh, et al. [25 ] studied the relationship between SDGs and the LEED indicators of “water efficiency” and “energy efficiency”. It was found that there was a link between the water efficiency indicators and SDGs 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, and 15. The energy efficiency indicators are more closely related to SDGs 7, 8, 9, 12, and 13. Opon and Henry [28 ] explored the indicators of sustainable concrete based on the “three pillars” and SDGs. They found that these indicators are more significantly associated with SDGs 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13. Type 2 studies are associated with research on the relationship between the SDGs and specific building phases or subsectors. In 2019, Goubran and Cucuzzella [22 ] found that the early stages of architectural design have a direct impact on SDGs 6, 7, 9, and 17 and an indirect impact on SDGs 4, 8, 11, and 15. In the same year, Goubran [24 ] studied the relationship between the real estate industry and SDGs. According to the findings, real estate was linked to 17 SDGs, but the degrees of closeness were different. Among these goals, SDGs 1, 6, 11, 14, and 15 were considered to have a more direct connection with real estate. The Type 3 studies focus on the association between the SDGs and GBRT, and they can be divided into two sub-types according to the authors’ categories which are scientific research conducted by scholars and authoritative information issued by professional institutions (listed as Type 3.1 and 3.2 in Table 2 ). Gellers [30 ] argued that the LEED could help significantly with SDGs 3, 6, 7, 11, and 15. Miyazaki et al. [31 ] evaluated the relationship between the Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency (CASBEE) and SDGs. The new building version of CASBEE was found to be most closely related to SDG 12, while the CASBEE city version was more closely related to SDG 11. Alawneh et al. [33 ] built a new framework in their latest research that links the SDGs to the indicators of the Jordanian GBRT. It was found that “drinking water consumption” contributed the most to the SDGs. Tsim et al. [32 ] analyzed the association between the Assessment Standard for Green Buildings (ASGB) and SDGs. Their results showed that the ASGB contributed significantly to SDGs 6, 7, 11, and 12, while the contribution to SDGs 3, 8, 9, 14, and 15 was secondary. The WGBC [34 ] believes that GB could contribute to SDGs 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, and 17 in varying degrees. However, there are some different views from the UNEP [35 ], who believe that SDGs 4, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 17 are closely related to GB. In addition, some national green building committees have also expressed conflicting views [36–39 ]. The Green Building Council of Australia (GBCA [38 ]) and the German Sustainable Building Certificate (GSBC [39 ]) elaborated on the links between Green Star and German Society for Sustainable Building (DGNB) and SDGs, respectively. In particular, the latest version of the DGNB detailed the contribution and degree of each evaluation indicator to different SDGs as shown in Fig. 1   [39 ]. The summary from the literature review indicated that the SDGs are being rapidly integrated into the research area of GB [22 ]. Obviously, despite divergent views, some important consensus has been reached. Not all 17 SDGs are closely related to GB, and the relationship between different SDGs and GB is different [40 ,41 ]. It can be concluded that SDGs 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 15 are generally considered to be closely related to GB, while SDGs 1, 2, and 5 are considered to be weakly connected to GB. In addition, the relationship between the GBRT and SDGs has been discussed qualitatively, with the DGNB having the most in-depth discussion [36–39 ]. Considering a large number of buildings are certified by the GBRT [9 ,42 ], the existing research gap has been identified as the lack of in-depth and quantitative analysis about GB's contribution to the SDGs, as shown in Fig. 2  .  3 Research methods The research method of this paper can be divided into three parts as depicted in Fig. 3  . First, the research gap between GB and the SDGs was established by the literature review. The second and most critical part of this study was to develop a model for quantifying and identifying GB's contribution to the SDGs. Finally, the established model was validated using a GBRT-certified building as a practical case study. 3.1 Collection and analysis of relevant basic data Based on an extensive and in-depth review of the literature, nine SDGs, i.e. SDGs 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 15, were identified as the most significant goals having a direct impact on GB, which is the scope of this work. Furthermore, this research scope is highly consistent with the information provided by the DGNB shown in Fig. 1 , which facilitates the exclusion of non-critical information. Considering the existing information shown in Fig. 2 , the GBRT was identified as the bridge for studying GB's contribution to the SDGs.  3.2 Build an assessment model for GB and the SDGs 3.2.1 Establish a unified indicator framework for GBRTs As different GBRTs have significantly different indicators and classifications, a common indicator framework is needed for unification [18 ,43 ]. There is some published research in this area, and the subsequent discussion will draw upon some of the literature findings. Specifically, the unified framework proposed in this work was developed based on the research reported by Zimmermann et al. [44 ]. After a comparison with the GBRT samples, this study supplemented this framework as shown in Table 3  . This research will integrate different GBRT indicators based on the established unified framework.  3.2.2 Reclassification of different GBRT indicators The GBRT indicators are then qualitatively analyzed and re-encoded and then used in the framework as presented in Table 4  . First, this framework integrates the DGNB criteria for new construction (NC), which are referred to as “benchmark criteria” in this study, as they already contain qualitative information about the SDGs. Then, according to the description of the specific indicator in the unified framework in Table 2 , the criteria for other samples of the GBRT, which are called “sample criteria” in this study, are entered into this framework. This study selected the 2009 version of the LEED for non-residential NC as the sample, which will facilitate the case study. It should be noted that the prerequisites in the GBRT were not considered in this study because they cannot be quantified [45 ]. Finally, the reclassification of GBRT indicators is a qualitative process because a precise one-to-one correspondence cannot be achieved [46 ]. For example, there is no criterion related to “urban heat island (UHI)" in the DGNB, but it appears in other GBRTs. Considering that the impact of the UHI on the microenvironment around the site is consistent with the meaning of “environmental impact” [47 ], it is classified accordingly.  3.2.3 Clarify the coordination mechanism between the GBRT and SDGs Table 4  not only links the benchmark and sample criteria through a unified framework but also illustrates the different qualitative relationships between the criteria and SDGs, which are shown in Fig. 1 . Based on this, the contribution path of the GBRT to the SDGs was identified, i.e. the indicators of the GBRT are the basic source of this contribution, which is passed to different SDGs whose Targets serve as a medium (see Fig. 4  ). The CV from the GBRT to different SDGs can be calculated using the following formula:(1) C V m = ∑ CV n  #         where CVm  is the CV made by GBRT on the m -th SDGs; CVn  is the CV made by GBRT on the n -th SDG Targets belonging to the m -th SDGs.  3.2.4 Quantitative analysis of the relationship between the GBRT and SDG targets As shown in Fig. 4 , the CV made by the GBRT indicators on different SDG Targets are divided into three types: strongly related, moderately related, and weakly related. These qualitative relationships need to be converted into quantitative information with the help of a suitable mathematical tool. For this study, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), which was developed by Thomas Saaty in 1980, was chosen to handle the transformation from qualitative to quantitative information. The AHP has been widely used to solve multi-standard decision problems and to determine the weight of evaluation indicators [48 ]. In addition to considering its extensive use as a common tool, the AHP was selected for its advantages such as simplicity, identifying conflicts, and benchmarking [49 ]. This research method involves an innovative and flexible use of the AHP, which is used to decompose the CV of the GBRT indicators to different SDGs. Furthermore, the AHP used in this study is a little different from the conventional AHP, as shown in Fig. 5  . Specifically, the initial data used in this study was based on reliable quantitative information which has already been provided by the DGNB, rather than on the questionnaires used by the conventional AHP, which was criticized as relying too heavily on the experience and uncertain subjective understanding of the respondents [50 ]. In fact, there are too many GBRT indicators and SDG Targets, and their relationship is also very complicated, posing a major challenge to the use of the conventional AHP, which strictly limits the number of elements (maximum nine) for pairwise comparisons [51 ]. Fig. 5  also shows the different key steps in the two applications of the AHP. For the conventional AHP, the perceptual judgments made by respondents based on established scales are the most core and basic, while for the research method in this study, choosing the suitable scales based on existing quantitative relationships becomes the most critical aspect of the process. Despite the differences in the sources of the initial data, this study strictly follows the core philosophy and steps of the AHP. The basic principle of the AHP is to divide complex problems into several ordered levels and then build an internal independent hierarchy [52 ]. Usually, mathematical methods are used to compare the qualitative importance of two elements and then to determine quantitative information about the relative importance of each element [51 ]. There are five main procedures: hierarchical modelling, judgment scale, pairwise comparison, priority derivation, and consistency check [13 ,53 ].a) Build the hierarchical model.    First, as indicated in Table 4 , some indicators are considered to be associated with only one or two SDG Targets, and these indicators are called “simple indicators” in this study. The analysis process for the simple indicators is not suitable for AHP calculations, because the largest matrix size they can build is two [52 ]. In addition to simple indicators, other indicators are related to more than three SDG Targets. This study established a hierarchical model for each of them, as shown in Fig. 6  , in which the indicator “environmental impact” is taken as an example. This model has a concise structure; however, each indicator needs to be calculated individually. Through a pairwise comparison of the degree of influence of an indicator on i  SDG Targets, an i  by i  judgment matrix can be built in which the diagonal elements are always 1 (see Table 5  ). Then, pairs of factors at the same level are evaluated to measure their comparative contributions to different SDG Targets. A series of judgments are made by this pairwise comparison to establish priorities between elements. Based on the value of the comprehensive weight, the relative priority of each SDG Target can be obtained [54 ]. After the priorities are determined, the eigenvalue consistency index (CI) needs to be calculated:(2) C I = ( λ m a x − n )  / ( n − 1 )  #         where λ max  is the maximum eigenvalue; n  is the dimension of the matrix. Finally, the global consistency test should be conducted to evaluate the coherence of the judgments, which is measured by the consistency ratio (CR):(3) C R = C I / R I #         where CI is the consistency index, and RI is the random index, which is obtained from the random indices proposed by Saaty [55 ] as given in Table 6  . The smaller the value of CR, the better the consistency of the judgment. Furthermore, if CR is less than 0.1, the consistency of the matrix is considered to be in an acceptable range. Therefore, the CR will be an important basis for selecting a suitable comparative scale in this study.c) Selection of the appropriate judgment scale    This study uses the Saaty 1–9 scale, which is the most commonly used scale in AHP research. In addition, the selection of appropriate scales is also of great significance for this study, as this process is a reasonable conversion of verbal into numeric scales [56 ]. Our objective for this process is to ensure that the results have a good degree of discrimination under the premise of ensuring the consistency. As shown in Table 7  , “1″ is selected as the numeric scale for the factors that are equally important. Another option that can be chosen is applying “9″ the case in which one factor is much more important than the other, which provides a benchmark for the choice of other scales. In addition, other scale selections need to go through multiple rounds of testing to determine the most suitable one. The scale selection of five different test schemes and their CR are shown in Table 8  . Obviously, the CR value in Scheme 5 is the smallest, almost 0. According to the definition by Saaty [55 ], this means that Scheme 5 is the most consistent with human psychology and logic. Therefore, the scale selection in Scheme 5 is considered optimal. In fact, the quantitative results of the three different qualitative descriptions presented in Scheme 5 show the characteristics of the geometric sequence, that is, the corresponding magnitudes of significant, moderate, and weak impacts are 9, 3, and 1, respectively. It turns out that because the AHP method system itself is complementary, a certain degree of scale difference does not cause significant changes. Fig. 7   shows a comparison of the results of the five schemes in Table 8 . This complementarity reduces to a certain extent the risk of large deviations in the results of this study. Through the above AHP calculation steps, the associated values (AV) of SDG Targets with indicators other than simple indicators are calculated. For the simple indicators, some of which, such as “thermal comfort”, have only a weak impact on one target, it is unreasonable to pay all AV generated by this indicator to that target. To solve the problem and simplify the AV calculation for the simple indicators, this study introduces the influence magnitude (IM) and adjustment coefficient (AC), which are determined based on the selected Scheme 5 as shown in Table 9  , and the corresponding formula is as follows:(4) A V i = A C i ∗ I M i / ∑ IM i #         where AVi  is the AV made by the i -th indicator on the specific SDG Target; ACi  is the adjustment coefficients for the i -th indicator. IMi  is the influence magnitudes of the specific SDG Target. According to the above calculation method, all the AVs between indicators and SDG Targets can be integrated, and the details are given in Appendix 1 .d) Calculation of the CV made by the GBRT to the SDGs and their Targets    The indicators involved in this study have been given different weights in the GBRT samples that represent their importance in evaluating building performance. When considering the AV made by the GBRT for different SDG Targets, it must be combined with the weight information of their indicators. Table 10   lists the versions of the DGNB and LEED and the calculation formulas for their indicator weights. After the indicator's weight (Wi) and AV to the SDG Target are calculated, the CV made by the GBRT to the 31 SDG Targets can be quantified by the following formula.(5) C V n = ∑ i = 1  31  ( A V i ∗ W i )  #         where CVn  is the CV made by the specific GBRT on the n -th SDG Target; AVi  is the AV made by the i -th indicator on the n -th SDG Target. Wi  is the weight of the i -th indicator. Through the above calculations, the CV made by the GBRT samples for each SDG Target is accurately quantified and presented in Appendices 2 and 3 . It should be noted that the LEED provides additional credits for “innovation” and “regional priority” indicators, which are also considered as additional parts in this study, as shown in Table 10 .  3.2.5 Quantitative analysis of the relationship between GB and the SDGs The ultimate goal of this study is to calculate and label the CV of GB to the SDGs. And the contribution to the SDGs from the GBRT, which is considered as a medium, has now been quantified. Furthermore, as long as the achievement ratio (AR) of the GBRT-certified GB for each indicator is combined with existing information, the CV of the GB for each SDG Target can be obtained. Specifically, the CV of GB for each SDG Target can be calculated by the following formula.(6) C V m = C V i ∗ A R i #         where CVm  is the CV made by the specific GB on the m -th SDG Target. CVi  is the CV made by the i -th indicator on the m -th SDG Target. ARi  can be expressed as the ratio of the score obtained by the i -th indicator of GB and the possible score of this indicator.    4 Results and discussion Although existing research has established links between the SDGs and GBs, these links are generally theoretical explorations based on qualitative analysis and they fail to offer practical help for the development of GBs. Accordingly, the current study proposes a model for measuring the contributions of GBs to the SDGs by using GBRTs as an intermediate bridge. Furthermore, indicators play a central role in the model and significantly affect the output of the model in three ways, as follows (Fig. 8  ):a) the different AVs of GBRT indicators with each SDG,  b) the weights received by a specific indicator from different GBRTs and  c) the AR of different indicators for a certified building.    4.1 AV of different GBRT indicators with each SDGs As an important basis of the model, the AV of different GBRT indicators with each SDG was described qualitatively by GSBC [39 ]; then, the AV was transformed into quantitative information by using the analytic hierarchy process in accordance with the description. Evidently, not all indicators support the SDGs equally (Table 4 ), providing the most original insight into the extent of GBRTs’ contribution to the SDGs. Firstly, the indicators that GSBC [39 ] considered weakly connected to the SDGs were identified using Equation (4) . These indicators, called ‘weak indicators’ in this study, failed to efficiently contribute all of their weights from GBRTs to the SDGs. These weak indicators were divided into two categories depending on their efficiency: slightly weak indicators with a total AV of 33.33% and strongly weak indicators with a total AV of 11.11% (Table 11  ). Most of these indicators are weak in terms of social sustainability, such as management-related indicators represented by ‘equipment management’ and indoor environmental indicators represented by ‘thermal comfort’. This finding was supported by Doan et al. [41 ], who believed that management-related indicators exhibit ambiguous attributes in supporting SBs. Although indoor environmental indicators are considered more closely related to SDGs due to their impact on user health [33 ], the current findings only support this view in terms of ‘3.2.4 indoor air quality (IAQ)’, but underestimate the role of other well-being indicators, as listed in Table 11 . Furthermore, ‘land development’ and ‘pollution’ (noise and light pollution) were believed to make important contributions to the SDGs by supporting biodiversity [23 ,57 ]; this assumption is inconsistent with the view of GSBC [39 ] on the two indicators (Table 11 ). Secondly, indicators related to energy, water, materials and IAQ were considered the common focus of GBRTs [13 ,41 ,58 ,59 ], and their relationship to the SDGs was also identified (Fig. 9  ). Evidently, except for ‘1.2.2 water efficiency’, which is only closely related to SDG 6, the other indicators are related to multiple SDGs and all are related to SDG 12 in various degrees. In particular, ‘1.2.1 energy reduction’ is most closely related to SDG 7 (AV: 60%), followed by SDGs 8 and 12 (AV: both 20%). Another energy indicator, namely, ‘1.2.3 renewable energy’, is not only related to SDGs 7, 8 and 12 (AV: 28.57%, 14.29% and 42.86%, respectively) but also to SDG 9 (AV: 14.29%). The two indicators of materials, i.e. ‘1.2.4 responsible materials’ and ‘1.4 recycle’, are most closely related to SDG 12 (AV: 70% and 50%, respectively), and the former is also related to SDGs 8 and 15 (AV: 20% and 30%, respectively). The latter is also related to SDG 8 (AV: 30%). The indicator ‘3.2.4 IAQ’ is related to SDGs 3 and 12 (AV: 66.67% and 33.33%, respectively). Although Di Foggia [27 ] believed that energy efficiency measures only provide strong support for SDGs 11 and 13, Alawneh et al. [25 ,33 ] supported the aforementioned findings on energy indicators, but also found several discrepancies on the performance of water indicators, which they believed to be related to SDGs 6, 8, 9, 12, 13 and 15. Omer and Noguchi [29 ] introduced the direct and positive contributions of building materials to SDGs 3, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13 and 15. Their findings differ from those of Alawneh et al. [33 ], who indicated that the corresponding beneficiaries were SDGs 8, 12, 13 and 15. The latter is nearly in line with the findings of the current study. By contrast, Alawneh, et al. [33 ] believed that IAQ is only related to SDG 3, disregarding its contribution to SDG 12 emphasised by GSBC [39 ]. Finally, the indicators for each SDG were divided into three categories in accordance with their corresponding AV: strong indicators (AV≥66.67%), moderately strong indicators (66.67% > AV≥33.33%) and moderately weak indicators (AV<33.33%), as indicated in Table 12  . Evidently, SDG 12 has the most number of related indicators, reaching 15, followed by SDGs 11 and 3, with 11 and 10, respectively. The top three SDGs simultaneously have the three aforementioned types of indicators. By contrast, SDGs 6 and 9 have only three indicators. For the latter, all three are moderately weak indicators. Furthermore, for SDGs 3, 6, 7, 11, 12 and 15, only one strong indicator was identified, namely, ‘3.2.4 IAQ’, ‘1.2.2 improved water efficiency’, ‘2.1 LCC’, ‘3.4.1 convenient service’, ‘1.4 recycling’ and ‘1.3.2 biodiversity protection’, respectively. Tsim et al. [32 ] believed that SDGs 11 and 12 have the highest number of supporting indicators, and they reached consensus with the aforementioned identification of strong indicators for SDGs 3, 6 and 15. However, SDG 6, which has the least indicators in the current study, was believed to be one of the SDGs with the most indicators by Tsim et al. [32 ], who also presented different perspectives on the strong indicators of SDGs 7, 11 and 12. By contrast, the outstanding contribution to corresponding SDGs by several strong indicators has nearly reached consensus, such as ‘IAQ’ to SDG 3, ‘water efficiency’ to SDG 6, ‘service convenience’ to SDG 11, ‘recycling’ to SDG 12 and ‘biodiversity’ to SDG 15 [36 ,38 ,60–62 ]. Meanwhile, the strong support provided by energy-related indicators to SDG 7 is widely recognised [36 ,38 ,63 ], disregarding the important role of LCC in improving economic efficiency [64 ]. In summary, partial consensus has been reached with regard to the link between GBRT indicators and the SDGs, particularly in terms of identifying the strong indicators of each SDG. However, several unresolved concerns remain, and these are mostly reflected in the impact and intensity of indicators on different SDGs. This area requires further studies in the future, considering that in-depth studies on the relationship between GB indicators and the SDGs are scarce.  4.2 Contribution of GBRTs to SDGs 4.2.1 Overall contribution of GBRTs to SDGs The different weights assigned to an indicator by various GBRTs represent another important aspect that affects the output of the proposed model. From Equation (5) , the CVs of the two GBRT samples for the SDGs were calculated as shown in Appendices 2 and 3 . One of the noticeable differences is that the total CVs of DGNB and LEED are 70.58% and 86.89%, respectively. Although this finding seems to indicate that the latter contributes more to the SDGs than the former, this scenario is not completely the case. The difference is entirely due to the weight of the weak indicators given by various GBRTs, as shown in Table 11 . Evidently, DGNB shows more attention to these weak indicators, leading to an undesirable performance in total CV. In this regard, the comparison of the overall contribution of different GBRTs to SDGs is considered unreliable in this study on the basis of the following considerations.a) The relevance of indicators for the SDGs remains controversial, raising questions to the accuracy of results.  b) GBRTs are merely guiding tools for improving practice, and their overall contribution to the SDGs does not represent the corresponding performance of the buildings that they certified [65 ,66 ].    By contrast, discussing the different performance of GBRTs on the SDGs is more meaningful to explore their various attitudes and focus.  4.2.2 Analysis of the different performance of GBRTs on the SDGs As mentioned earlier, the AVs of indicators with the SDGs and the weights of indicators given by GBRTs determine the CVs given by GBRTs to different SDGs (Fig. 10  ). The weighting system is the core of GBRTs [67–69 ]; this system is typically compatible with local geography, climate, culture and other characteristics [70–73 ]. The indicator weights of DGNB are evidently more balanced, and DGNB focuses on the economic aspects, as shown in Fig. 10  (a). Meanwhile, LEED focuses on the environmental aspects, which receive more than half of the total weight, as shown in Fig. 10  (b). In consideration of the large amount of research on comparing different GBRT weight systems [41 ,44 ,50 ,70 ,74 ], the current study will not repeat them here. The CVs given by DGNB and LEED to the SDGs were calculated as shown in Fig. 11  . Overall, although the nine selected SDGs were recognised as the most closely related to GBRTs, their CVs obtained from the two GBRT samples are remarkably different. In particular, SDG 12, which ensures sustainable consumption, has become the biggest beneficiary, and DGNB and LEED rate it highly, 17.54% and 19.04%, respectively. The results are reasonable, considering that most indicators are related to SDG 12 (Table 12 ), and the strong support from the key indicators of GBRTs for SDG 12 (Fig. 8 ). However, this result is unexpected to a certain extent because SDG 11 was previously considered favourable by GBRTs [75 ], and EmiratesGBC [37 ] even considered SDG 12 to be unrelated to GBRTs. Furthermore, this result coincides with the study of Miyazaki et al. [31 ] and Czerwinska [34 ]. SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) is ranked second in accordance with the weights received from DGNB and LEED, which are 12.71% and 15.54%, respectively. This result confirms that GBRTs place considerable importance to building energy performance [26 ,41 ,42 ,76 ,77 ]. SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and SDG 3 (good health and well-being) are ranked in the third position, and both have received nearly the same CVs of more than 11% from DGNB and LEED. A similar situation can be observed in SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), which receives a CV of approximately 8% from both GBRTs. Compared with the unsatisfactory ranking of SDG 11, SDG 3 performs well because GBRTs pay more attention to indoor environmental quality and well-being [29 ,41 ,78 ,79 ]. For the two GBRT samples, the largest difference appears in SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), which receives a CV as high as 10.09% from LEED, but obtains a CV of only 3.18% from DGNB. This discrepancy reflects previous inconsistencies between scholars, such as Gellers [30 ], and institutions, such as the United Nations Environment Program, regarding the association between GBRTs and SDG 6. By contrast, SDGs 9, 13 and 15 are the least favoured by the two GBRTs amongst the nine SDGs, and their CVs are all within 5%. These findings disagree with the published literature, which suggests that GBRTs can significantly help these SDGs, as shown in Table 2  [25 ,26 ,28 ,29 ]. Overall, despite the differences in weighting system, a consensus is reached between the two GBRT samples in most of the SDGs, particularly on the most and least valued SDGs. Several differences still exist in a few SDGs, explaining divergent views in the literature [30–33 ].  4.2.3 Contribution of the GBRT samples to the SDG targets With regard to the SDG Targets, the situation changes slightly as shown in Fig. 12  . SDG Target 7.3 (energy efficiency) was the most noticeable because LEED gave it the highest CV (>14%) and DGNB also placed considerable importance to it, giving it a CV score of approximately 8%. As the delivery medium of CV, SDG Target 7.3 provides the most efficient path between SDG 7 and GBRTs. It is referred to as the ‘key target’ of SDG 7 in this study. DGNB gave the highest CV to SDG Target 12.2 (utilization of natural resources). SDG Target 12.2 was regarded nearly equally by LEED and DGNB, receiving a CV of more than 10%, and undoubtedly becoming the key target of SDG 12. Similarly, SDG Target 8.4 (decoupling economic growth and environmental degradation) was the key target for SDG 8 because it received an average CV of approximately 7% from the two GBRT samples. No similar key targets were found for the other SDGs. In particular, SDG Targets 3.4 and 3.9 were both important and ranked nearly the same for SDG 3. The same situation was observed for SDG Targets 6.3 and 6.4 and SDG Targets 11.3, 11.6 and 11.7. By contrast, SDG Targets 8.2, 8.3, 8.7, 11.5, 11.b, 12.6, 12.8 and 13.1 played insignificant roles for their SDGs, and SDG Targets 6.5, 7.2, 8.5, 9.1 and 11.2 provided limited contributions to their SDGs. None of the six Targets of SDG 15 performed well, reflecting the poor performance of SDG 15 in Fig. 11 . Although the comparison of the overall contribution of different GBRTs to the SDGs was found to be unsuitable, as mentioned earlier, the performance of different GBRTs on the SDGs provides an important benchmark for evaluating the contribution of their certified buildings to the SDGs.   4.3 Case study The AR of different indicators of a certified building is the third important factor that affects the final output, and this section analyses the role of this factor in conjunction with actual cases. LEED provides detailed information about certification projects on its official website, but such data are difficult to obtain for many other GBRTs; combined with this study's interest in current and high-level certification, a nonresidential building in Malaysia that received LEED V3 Platinum certification in February 2020 was selected [80 ]. The information regarding LEED V3 indicators and the scores for this case are provided in Table 13  . Firstly, the CVs of the building for the SDG Targets were calculated using Equation (6) . Combined with the CV information from LEED for the SDG Targets in Fig. 10 , the case's AR for each SDG Target was computed as shown in Fig. 13  . Evidently, the largest CV in this case is for SDG Target 7.3, reaching nearly 12%, followed by SDG Targets 12.2 and 8.4, both exceeding 5%. They were followed by SDG Targets 3.4, 3.9, 6.3, 6.4, 11.6 and 11.7, which all recorded CVs of approximately 4%. However, all the other targets had CV scores within the 3% margin. From the perspective of AR, the best performance was demonstrated by SDG Targets 11.7 and 11.b, achieving the full CV of LEED V3. By contrast, with the exception of SDG Targets that did not receive any CV from LEED, the lowest AR (within 30%) was achieved for SDG Targets 7.1 and 11.3. Subsequently, the CV of the building for each SDG was quantified using Equation (1) . Similarly, the AR for each SDG of this building was examined in conjunction with the CV information from LEED on the SDGs in Fig. 11 . Fig. 14   shows that the building had the largest CV (11.60%) for SDG 7, surpassing SDG 12, which was ranked second, with a CV of 11.45%. SDG 12 was followed by SDGs 11, 3 and 6, which scored CV values of 9.32%, 8.97% and 8.09%, respectively. The CVs received by the remaining SDGs were all within 6%, and the lowest CV of 1.64% was achieved by SGD 15. This result significantly differed from the ranking of the SDGs in Fig. 11  because the building had different ARs for the SDGs. In particular, SDG 12 lost its previous advantage because of its relatively low AR, i.e. 62.14%, placing it at second in the new ranking. By contrast, SDG 13 benefitted from a high AR that improved its ranking. Meanwhile, the lowest AR of 50.02% was obtained by SDG 15. In addition, the additional CVs generated by the ‘innovation’ and ‘regional priority’ indicators calculated using Equation (b) and presented in Table 10  were encouraging. SDG 6 was the biggest beneficiary, with an additional 2% CV, and SDGs 7, 11 and 12 received additional CVs of 0.22%, 0.56% and 0.33%, respectively. Lastly, but most importantly, this research developed an identification system for expressing the GB's contribution to the SDGs based on the CVs given by LEED to the SDGs. The case study results are presented in Fig. 15  . The results provide important information, such as the contribution of GBRTs to the SDGs, the extent to which the GB has achieved it, the ranking of the benefitting SDGs and additional contributions provided by ‘innovation’ and ‘regional priority’. The visual illustration of this important information makes the contribution of the GB to the SDGs easier to understand. If this information is publicised, e.g. as part of the certification result, or posted in the public domain of the building, then it will be helpful in raising public awareness towards sustainable development and promoting people's support for GBs.  4.4 Applicability and recommendations of the study This section discusses the applicability and generality of the research methods and results, including the proposed indicator framework, GBRTs' performance on the SDGs and the limitations of eliminating prerequisites. Lastly, specific suggestions are made to improve GBs’ contribution to the SDGs. 4.4.1 Applicability and generality of the proposed indicator framework The universality of this study primarily depends on the applicability of the proposed indicator framework developed on the basis of the research of Zimmermann et al. [44 ], who analyzed 10 globally famous GBRTs by using this framework. Then, the framework was successfully applied by Wen et al. [18 ], who integrated 42 different GBRTs’ NC versions into the framework. Furthermore, the applicability of the framework actually originates from the similar system mechanisms of GBRTs and the indicators of general focus in GBRTs [41 ,70 ,72 ,81 ]. The applicability of the framework has been further improved through supplementation in the current study. Considering that the benchmark criteria are from DGNB for NC, any GBRT version for NC, including residential and nonresidential buildings, can be applied to this framework.  4.4.2 Verification of GBRTs’ performance on the SDGs As the local GBRT in Malaysia, the Green Building Index (GBI) was selected as an additional sample to further verify the applicability of the framework and the current findings regarding GBRTs’ contribution to the SDGs. GBI (NC version for nonresidential buildings) is not included in the list of GBRT samples selected by Zimmermann et al. [44 ] and Wen et al. [18 ], providing validity and rationality for the verification work. Firstly, GBI indicators were integrated into the unified framework, as shown in Table 14  , showing further evidence for the compatibility of the framework. Considering that the weight system of GBI is basically the same as that of LEED V3, the weight calculation method of GBI refers to Equations (a) and (b) in Table 10 , and the results are provided in Appendix 4 . Fig. 16   shows the CVs given by GBI to the SDGs, and GBI's overall performance is basically consistent with the current findings. In particular, SDG 12 is still at the top of the list, with SDG 7 closely following. The CVs of SDG 9, 13 and 15 are nearly the same with those for LEED and DGNB, ranking at the bottom. Furthermore, GBI's performance is more similar to LEED, demonstrating their nearly identical views on the importance of different indicators. Although considerable consistency is observed, relatively large differences are found in SDG 11, which is not valued by GBI and nearly reduce to the worst ranking.  4.4.3 Limitations in eliminating prerequisites As a common mechanism, prerequisites are adopted by some GBRTs, ensuring that certification projects meet certain minimum requirements in specific aspects [82 ]. Credit is not assigned, and thus, prerequisites are frequently overlooked because they cannot be quantified [18 ,44 ,83 ]. The same condition applies to the current study, inevitably imposing several limitations to its results. In particular, for GBRTs without prerequisites, such as DGNB and GBI, the proposed research method has no effect on their outcomes. By contrast, for GBRTs with prerequisites, such as LEED, their outputs will be affected to a certain extent. As the necessary threshold for GB certification, prerequisites actually make a strong contribution to the SDGs. To reduce this inevitable limitation, some related studies can be used as a supplement for this research [25 ], and an in-depth special study on this topic is necessary in the future.  4.4.4 Specific suggestions for improving GBs’ contribution to the SDGs Two effective approaches can enhance the contribution of GBs to the SDGs.a) Using SDG 15 with a low AR as an example, Fig. 10  shows the indicators that contribute significantly, including indicators 1.2.4 and 1.3.2, for which the corresponding LEED criteria can be found in Table 4 . These indicators are improved to increase GBs' contribution to SDG 15.  b) Any improvement made in the indicators, particularly in ‘innovation’ and ‘regional priority’, can provide additional points.       5 Conclusions The emphasis on addressing climate change and the specific SDGs pose a great challenge in the construction industry especially in understanding the interrelationship between GBs and the SDGs. The study presented in this paper builds a logical theoretical model for assessing GB's contribution to the SDGs. First, the GBRT was identified as the main bridge between GB and the SDGs. Indicators and SDG Targets were identified as the contributing factors and pathways because they can be the links between the GBRT, GB, and SDGs. This work also proposed a unified indicator framework and demonstrated that its versatility and flexibility brought the convenient application of different GBRTs to the proposed theoretical framework. To quantify GB's contribution to the SDGs, this study quantitatively transformed the qualitative relationship between the GBRT indicators and SDGs using the AHP method. The findings of this work revealed that although nine SDGs are considered to be closely related to the GBRT based on the literature, the GBRT's contribution to the goals are in fact significantly different. In particular, SDGs 12, 7, 3, and 11 obtained significant support from the GBRT with SDG 12 being the main beneficiary. On the other hand, GBRT's contribution to SDGs 9, 15, and 13 was relatively small among the nine SDGs. A further analysis showed that SDG Target 7.3 (energy efficiency) was the largest intermediate pathway in the contribution of the GBRT to the SDG, thus making it the most significant “key target". Finally, an LEED-certified building was successfully used as a case study to examine the proposed identification system for GB's contribution to the SDGs. The results not only intuitively revealed the contribution of GB to different SDGs but also showed the contribution of the GBRT to the SDGs. This research presented an innovative approach for measuring and visualizing areas in which GB contributes to the SDGs. It is hoped that this research will provide a deeper understanding and new perspective on the impact and relevance of the SDGs in the GB field.
