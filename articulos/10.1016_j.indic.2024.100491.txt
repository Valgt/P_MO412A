                  Canada's National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) is part of a global network of over 50 national Pollutant Release and Transfer Registries. These registries track industrial pollutant releases into the air, water, and land, and transfer and disposal of pollutants to various waste management practices. Despite the NPRI being a long-standing public dataset that can speak directly to Canadian progress on various reductions in chemical releases and waste generation sought by the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12, its data on pollutant transfers and disposals is so far overlooked in tracking SDG progress. This study aims to uncover the potential of this waste-related data to provide meaningful measures of progress toward SDG 12 using two case studies (on the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal and the Minamata Convention on Mercury) and a framework by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to do so. The findings challenge the premise that progress in the current SDG 12.4 indicator (number of parties to international chemical agreements that transmit required information) also leads to progress on overall SDG 12.4 waste-related aims. This analysis sets a precedent for using publicly available PRTR data from any country to monitor progress toward SDG 12 waste-related objectives, opening up new possibilities for more accurate global tracking of this SDG.

Keywords Canada  Pollutants  Inventories  Sustainable development goal 12   Data availability All data is available publicly, as described by the [dataset] references.   1 Introduction Since 1994, the National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) has been collecting and publishing data on pollutant releases (to air, water, and land) and transfers (to various waste management practices) from point source facilities across Canada. This information is used by various groups, from individual community members to global institutions, to support decision-making on the sound management of chemical pollutants (i.e., the protection of Canadians and their environment from the harmful effects of pollution) (Government of Canada, 2022a ). It was created and designed to address the growing public interest in the nature and quantity of chemical releases and wastes that could potentially harm human health and the environment (Environment Canada, 1992 ; United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2020 ; United Nations for Economic Cooperation and Development, 2008 ; United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2023a ). The public aspect of the NPRI and similar national Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers (PRTRs) around the world (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, 2016 ) was bolstered by the 1990s global movement towards public participation in sustainable development decision-making as outlined in principle 10 of the Rio Declaration (United Nations, 1992 ), the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (United Nations, 1998 ), and now also embodied in the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 16 (SDG) (target 16.7 – Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels) (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs – Sustainable Development ). As of this writing, the NPRI has published almost 30 years of data on pollutant releases and transfers for over 300 substances from over 7000 point-source facilities in Canada. This vast and expanding dataset empowers audiences everywhere to make data-driven pollutant management decisions. Given its roots, and its direct measures of pollutant releases and transfers to waste, the NPRI (and other PRTRs) can be key indicators for measuring progress towards sound chemicals management, as described by SDG 12 “Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns”, and its targets: 12.4 and 12.5 (i.e., achieve the sound management of chemicals and all wastes  in accordance with agreed international frameworks and by significantly reducing their releases to air, water and soil in order to minimize impacts on human health and the environment; and by substantially reducing waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse) (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs – Sustainable Development ). However, current official SDG 12.4 and 12.5 indicators (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs – Sustainable Development; Government of Canada, 2023a ; United Nations Environment Programme, 2024 ; One Planet Network, 2024 ) do not leverage PRTRs, nor do they measure releases, waste, or harm reductions - information needed for meaningful SDG 12 tracking. Instead, current official indicators measure the number of parties to international chemicals management agreements (One Planet Network, 2024 ) (such as the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal (United Nations Environment Programme, 2019 ) and the Minamata Convention on Mercury (United Nations Environment Programme, 2023 )) that meet their commitments and obligations in transmitting information  as required by each relevant agreement, and normalized rates of hazardous waste generation, treatment, and recycling, which are limited to informing surface-level member-party reporting compliance (but not the content of the reports) and relative changes. Therefore, there are opportunities to use PRTR data to more directly inform on SDG 12 progress. Indeed, and despite the official SDG 12 indicators, the OECD has defined a role for using PRTRs in analyzing and tracking SDG 12. The OECD framework for doing so describes using PRTRs first to identify what substances, quantities, facilities, industry sectors, environmental compartments (including waste management types, transfers origins and destinations) or geographic regions are implicated in the state, provenance and transfer of industrial pollutants, and then using this information for more sophisticated analyses in terms of SDG 12 aims. Such analyses include, among other things, understanding the effectiveness of environmental management and policies (i.e. the international/multilateral chemical agreements referred to in SDG 12) and characterizing the transboundary movement of pollutants in waste (a key issue the Basel Convention aims to control) (Figs. SI–1 ). However, while the portion of the PRTR data on releases  (to air and water) is increasingly used in sustainability analysis (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, 2021 ), the transfers and disposals  portion (as described in (Government of Canada, 2022a ), ( Berthiaume, 2024 ) and summarized Table 1  ) has rarely been used (Berthiaume, 2021 ), despite being publicly available and having a clear role. Note that throughout this paper, the term “movement” is used interchangeably with the term “transfer” and describes intentional transfers of pollutants in waste between companies/facilities and not the5 movement of pollutants through the natural environment after their emission. Initial efforts to reverse this were recently presented in (Berthiaume), where introductory insights from the under-used NPRI transfers and disposal dataset were presented in line with the “basic attributes” segment of the OECD framework (Figs. SI–1  , center) and aimed to raise awareness about the data's content and availability. However, more sophisticated insights into SDG 12 progress, in line with the “analyses” segment of the OECD framework (Figs. SI–1  , right), have not yet been demonstrated in the literature. Thus, there are novel opportunities to use PRTR waste-related data for such analyses, including to characterize the transboundary movement (i.e. transboundary transfers) of wastes and to better understand this and other aspects of the effectiveness of environmental management policies (i.e. multilateral chemical agreements) (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, 2021 ; Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, 2017 ). This study addresses these opportunities to use PRTR transfer and disposal data to inform SDG 12 analysis using Canadian (NPRI) data as a precedent for the other 50+ nations with PRTRs to follow suit. The specific objectives of this study are to gain insights into the policy effectiveness and transboundary movement of pollutants in waste using case studies on two multilateral chemicals agreements relevant to SDG 12, namely.i) the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal (United Nations Environment Programme, 2019 ) (including Canada's domestic regulations to implement the Basel Convention)  ii) the Minamata Convention on Mercury (United Nations Environment Programme, 2023 )    While other international chemical agreements are relevant to SDG 12, (e.g., Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (United Nations Environment Programme, 2001 ), Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (United Nations Environment Programme, 1987 ), and Rotterdam Convention on Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade (United Nations Environment Programme, 1998 )), these have limited overlap with NPRI substances. When they do overlap, they rely on the Basel Convention to manage the hazardous waste aspects of their lifecycle and are therefore not discussed here. The novelty of this study is the demonstration of how previously overlooked NPRI (and other PRTR) transfers and disposals data can directly inform SDG 12 waste-related outcomes pertaining to international agreements, and can thus complement existing SDG indicators to help inform management directions based on problem areas, success stories, or both. Additionally, this Canadian example can potentially shift global attention to note the importance of PRTR transfers and disposal data in official global analyses of SDG 12. This shift may, in turn, lead to increased use of these under-utilized national data subsets in general, which would affirm the collection of this data in the first place and augment public participation in environmental decision-making, which is a fundamental aim of PRTRs.  2 Methods Initial NPRI data extraction and curation methods are provided in Berthiaume (2024)  and are not repeated in detail here. Briefly, these comprise extracting 2013–2022 NPRI data on transfers and disposals from Canada's open data portal in the form of the all-years CSV files and the comprehensive database (Government of Canada, 2024a ; Government of Canada, 2024b ). An additional data quality control issue was updated manually: a unit error correction of the Hg value reported by NPRI ID 29160 to incineration (2022) from 11520 kg to 115.250 kg. For the analysis discussed in section 3.2 , note that the Cross-border Movement of Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Recyclable Material Regulations  (Cross-border Movement of Hazardous Waste ) (i.e., the “XBR”) track the movement (i.e. intentional transfer) of waste by classification (including the substances contained in each classification), defined in Schedules 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and generally in schedules 11 and 12. Despite XBR focus being at the level of waste classification and less so at the substance-level, a comparison of the NPRI and XBR substances is nonetheless possible, and helps understand the substance-level crosstalk between the two programs. Tables SI–1   shows this NPRI and XBR substance comparison using the XBR definitions noted above, though this comparison was limited by differences and gaps in substance descriptions and coverage between the two programs. For example, whereas in some cases the XBR identifies substances in waste classes by individual CAS (Chemical Abstract Services) registry number (as does the NPRI, allowing direct crosstalk), in other cases, substances of concern are identified by description and custom identifiers that do not crosstalk with NPRI identifiers (e.g., “Arsenic and its compounds = “C8” or “L4” in XBR, depending on the type of waste it's contained, and “NA – 02” in NPRI). This issue was managed here by associating specific XBR and NPRI substances by CAS where applicable or by manually associating XBR substances/substance groups with their corresponding NPRI group(s). With this approach, there is the limitation that the quantities reported to the NPRI substance groups are not necessarily specific to the associated individual XBR substances but reflect the presence of a substance of potential (but unconfirmed) relevance to the XBR. There were ∼102 specific XBR substances that matched directly to NPRI substances by CAS, and another ∼75 XBR substances/substance groups (generally, metal-containing substances, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and dioxins/furans) that were associated with ∼60 NPRI substances/substance groups.  3 Results and discussion The following paragraphs present case studies of SDG 12-relevant international (and related domestic) policies on chemicals in waste and demonstrate the usefulness of the NPRI as a direct indicator of SDG 12. 3.1 Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their disposals The Basel Convention (United Nations Environment Programme, 2019 ), established in 1989 and ratified by Canada in 1992, aims to minimize the generation and international movement (i.e. intentional transfer) of hazardous and other wastes. Its primary goal is to prevent the exploitation of less developed countries as waste havens and to ensure that any internationally moved wastes are disposed of in environmentally sound ways. It is a key agreement counted in the reporting compliance metric of the official indicator for SDG 12, target 12.4 (One Planet Network, 2024 ) (achieve the sound management of chemicals and wastes in accordance with agreed international frameworks), and for this reason, it was chosen as a case study here. Canada has a record of 100% compliance with the information submission requirements of the Basel Convention (United Nations Environment Programme ); therefore, per the official SDG 12.4.1 indicator, progress toward this goal is fully on track. However, the fact that all required annual reports have been submitted does not give insight into actual progress toward the Convention's aim of minimizing hazardous waste generation and/or international movement. By contrast, the NPRI transfers and disposals data contains decades of annual information on the actual quantities of Canadian industrial pollutants being sent to various waste streams (either on-site or off-site) and their international movements/transfers and destinations (see Table 1 ). Thus, this data can be used to analyze whether the Basel Convention aims of reducing the generation and international movement of pollutants in waste are indeed being achieved. For example, the Convention stipulates, among other things, that parties shall not transfer waste to states that are not parties to the Convention (unless they have a bilateral/multilateral agreement). First, from the NPRI data, one can see that of the 19 nations receiving transfers of pollutants in waste as reported to the NPRI across 2013–2022, all but one (the US) was a Basel Convention member state (Fig. 1  ). However, since the US and Canada have a bilateral agreement in place for these transboundary movements (Government of Canada, 2022b ), this NPRI perspective shows that the destinations of the last 10 years of Canadian international transfers of industrial pollutants in waste are Basel compliant. Second, though the destinations are compliant, the NPRI data show increasing trends over recent years (since 2014) in quantities of pollutants in waste transferred to both Basel members and the US (Fig. 1 , pane b and c, respectively), suggesting that the Convention's aim of minimizing transboundary hazardous waste volume has not transpired (at least, from the Canadian/NPRI perspective).  Third, the Basel Convention aims to prevent the transboundary movement of pollutants in waste if acceptable waste management options exist domestically (i.e., to retain waste closest to the source), though there is an exception when the waste is needed as raw material for recycling/recovery industries in the state of import, or when it can be done efficiently and in an environmentally sound manner. Using NPRI data, analysis of the 23 substances being transferred in waste internationally to Basel member countries (i.e., excluding the US) across 2013–2022 indicates that all but Thallium (in 2018 & 2019) had at least one matching domestic waste management option (i.e., same year, same substance, same waste management practice) (Fig. 2  ). This perspective suggests that these movements did not necessarily align with the aim to minimize international movement when domestic waste management options exist. It is important to note, however, that most of these instances comprised transfers for recycling (see Fig. 1 , pane b and c), which suggests they possibly met the Basel exception of being needed as raw material by the importing nation. However, for the NPRI waste management categories of off-site disposal, the application of this exception is not obvious, and since similar waste management options were available in Canada for the international transfers of lead (2015) and zinc (2022) (Fig. 2 ), the justification for transboundary movement in these cases seems negated. Further investigation/confirmation of the potential non-compliances presented here may be warranted but is beyond scope here. Analysis of the transfers to the US also show >150 substances that have matching domestic waste management options in various years, many of which constitute transfers for disposal and are thus potentially outside the Basel exceptions for recycling. Despite bilateral agreements for the handling of these hazardous wastes, which may include measures to handle these transfers in an environmentally sound manner, these examples may illuminate further opportunities to align with Canada's Basel ambitions of keeping waste close to the source if/when environmentally sound management options exist domestically (see Figs. SI–2  ). These several examples demonstrate the value of the NPRI perspective in assessing Canadian progress toward SDG 12 and suggest that progress is not as fully on track as the official indicator 12.4.1 implies. In this case, the PRTR-based perspective shows that the environmental performance of the Basel Convention is adequate insofar as keeping hazardous waste from going to non-member parties; however, is diverging from its aim to minimize international pollutant movement and thus may be useful in informing policy decision-making to correct this course. Additional new perspectives on transboundary pollutant movements and the environmental performance of the Basel Convention can be gleaned by looking more specifically at the Canadian domestic rules that implement the Basel Convention: the Cross-border Movement of Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Recyclable Material Regulations  (Cross-border Movement of Hazardous Waste ) (established under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act ) (Government of Canada, 2023b ; Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 ) also known as “XBR”. These describe a federal documentation process to track domestic interprovincial and international movements of pollutants in waste/recyclables and are a means to ensure wastes reach their intended destination and are disposed of/recycled in an environmentally sound manner (and thus risks of chemical release to the environment is reduced). The XBR require information to be reported to the Canadian government about the quantity and classification of waste moving across borders, its intended destination facility, intended disposal/recycling operations (i.e., authorized methods that minimize environmental releases), and confirmation that these intentions were achieved, though (in contrast to the NPRI) this information is not then published. This topic was included in this case study because though the XBR tracks hazardous waste by classification, tracking by specific pollutant is not done (see Methods section ), whereas the NPRI can provide more granular views (in terms of specific substances, and quantities) of the movements of some (but not all, see Methods section  and Tables SI–1  ) XBR substances in waste, thus it can provide meaningful and publicly accessible measures of SDG 12 progress in the context of chemicals management. For example, the NPRI perspective allows a quantitative view not knowable by the SDG 12.4 official indicator, showing that in the period of 2013–2022, over 340,000 t of ‘hazardous waste or hazardous recycling material’ (i.e. the NPRI data associated with 91 XBR-relevant substances, see Tables SI–1  ) were moved out of Canada to over 600 facilities in 19 countries (all Basel-compliant, as discussed above; see Figs. SI–3 ). As mentioned above, these transboundary movements appear to be driven mainly by transfers for recycling (90%), and comprised mainly zinc, copper and lead going abroad for recovery of metals and metal compounds to nations as close as the US (∼300,000 t) and as far away as Australia, Sri Lanka, Japan, and Europe. By contrast, international transfers for either disposal or treatment were less common (∼20,000 t and ∼13,000 t, respectively) and went mainly to the US, with the exception of the two international disposals discussed above. Importantly, the 2013–2022 trend in the total quantities of XBR-relevant substances (i.e., the subset of XBR substances tracked by the NPRI, Tables SI–1  ) being transferred by NPRI facilities out of Canada is increasing (+4%), driven by copper, lead, and manganese recycling, whereas the number of facilities generating these quantities is decreasing (∼164–137), meaning fewer NPRI facilities are generating and moving more cross-border hazardous waste. The median and range of quantities transferred per substance are shown in Fig. 3   and are each relatively small (median 1.2 t, range <0.01 t to >5000 t), though these occur frequently enough to add up substantially over time. This view using NPRI data shows that regardless of effective documentation on the cross-border movement of these substances (and thus contributing to Canada's Basel Convention information submission obligations), their totals are increasing, which diverges from the downward trends expected by Basel Convention's aim of “minimization of generation and international movement of hazardous waste”, and the downwards trends in chemical wastes expected by SDG 12. Interestingly, NPRI data also showed there were relatively large amounts of cross-border transfers of substances not named in the XBR, including sulphuric acid (>1M t across 2013–2022), aluminum and its compounds, molybdenum trioxide and multiple organics (small amounts) that went mainly to the US for recycling. The trend in quantities for these international movements was flat overall (0%) but upward in the most recent five years (+27%), adding to the deviation from the overall downward trends in chemical waste quantities expected by SDG 12. The fact that these substances are not explicitly accounted for in the XBR but, according to NPRI, are moving across borders in substantial and recently increasing quantities (see Fig. 3 ) suggests that i) these may merit consideration under the XBR regulations (if it is determined that they meet the definition for hazardous waste under the regulations, which is analysis beyond scope here), and ii) by focusing the official SDG 12 aim and indicator only on international chemicals agreements, some substantial hazardous chemical releases/wastes may be missed, potentially compounding the inaccuracy of current official SDG 12.4.1 progress tracking. Also of note, the Basel Convention identifies substances of concern in Annex I and Annex VIII - List A (and with which Canada's XBR are aligned) which include several metals that are not on the NPRI (e.g., barium, beryllium, tellurium, tin) suggesting that these metals and their compounds may merit investigation and/or consideration for addition to NPRI, and emphasizing the need for multiple indicators and data sources to ensure adequate pollutant coverage. Further XBR and NPRI program differences and potential improvements for crosstalk, and thus understanding of transboundary movements and sustainability outcomes, are discussed in the SI .  3.2 Minamata Convention on Mercury The Minamata Convention on Mercury entered into force in 2017 and is an international legally binding instrument that describes obligations and measures related to the lifecycle of mercury, ultimately aimed at reducing the use and presence of mercury in the economy, industry and society toward protecting human and environmental health from anthropogenic mercury emissions/releases (United Nations Environment Programme, 2023 ). Like the Basel Convention above, it is a key international agreement counted in the current reporting compliance indicator for SDG 12.4 (One Planet Network, 2024 ) and thus relevant as a case study here to examine the usefulness of NPRI transfers and disposals data as a more direct sustainability indicator. Among other things, the Minamata Convention leverages and extends previous intentions stated in the Basel Convention to reduce mercury waste generation and international movement, and thus minimize associated impacts (Articles 10 & 11). Canada and 128 other nations, including the US, are a signatory to the Convention. The reporting obligations for member parties to the Minamata Convention (Article 21) comprise the submission of short reports every two years, and full reports every four years on the measures taken to implement the Convention, their effectiveness, and challenges in meeting Minamata objectives (United Nations Environment Programme, 2021 ). Per the official SDG 12.4 indicator to inform on progress toward achieving the sound management of chemicals and all wastes (in this case, focusing on mercury) in accordance with international frameworks, Canada has a record of 100% compliance to the information submission requirements (United Nations Environment Programme, 2021 ), indicating that Canadian SDG 12 progress in this regard is fully on track. However, a detailed analysis of the NPRI transfer and disposal data for mercury (and its compounds) in the lens of assessing environment policy performance and transboundary movement provides several insights that can add more meaningful information about actual progress towards Minamata Convention goals and SDG 12 than Article 21 reporting compliance alone. First, the total mercury reported to the NPRI as being sent various on-site and off-site waste streams across 2017–2022 (e.g., the time period since Minamata entered into force) was >1340 t, which is more than 111x the total mercury releases over the same period (∼12 t). Trends over time indicate that overall quantities going to waste management increased over that period by 87% (Figs. SI–4 ). These were driven by increases in: on-site disposals to landfills, tailings, and wasterock; off-site disposals to (mainly) domestic landfills; off-site transfers for recovery at both domestic and international destinations; off-site transfers for physical treatment at (mainly) domestic locations and treatment by incineration at both domestic and international (US) facilities. Note, however, that for this latter category, there was a substantial drop in 2022 (Fig. 4  ). This NPRI perspective emphasizes that the magnitude of mercury generation or circulation in the industrial waste stream is substantial, annual quantities are trending upward, and thus diverging from the downward trend direction intuited by SDG 12, “minimization of waste generation”. However, these upward trends are perhaps in line with expected increases in waste as a consequence of discontinuing demand for mercury use in industry, products and society, and therefore still a potentially useful indicator of Minamata Convention and thus SDG 12.4 performance. As a side note, mercury in waste rock and mine tailings from non-mercury mining operations are excluded from the Minamata Convention, presumably due to their unavoidable and/or low concentrations of mercury. While deliberations are ongoing about a concentration threshold above which this exemption would no longer apply, NPRI data show that mercury in mine tailings (from metal ore and coal mining over 2017–2022) amounts to 94 t, which is roughly 8x more than direct environmental releases for that period, and has trended upwards over this time period. This NPRI perspective presents potentially significant insights in the context of overall SDG 12.4 and adds quantitative insight to the magnitude of this gap in the current Minamata policy coverage. Similar to the coverage gaps discussed in the previous section, these findings suggest again that by focusing the official SDG 12 aim and indicator only on the scope of international chemicals agreements, some substantial hazardous chemical releases/wastes may be missed, potentially compounding the inaccuracy of current official SDG 12 progress tracking. Second, in the context of transboundary movement, of the total mercury in the off-site waste stream reported to the NPRI, 253 t were transferred for treatment (68%, mainly incineration), recycling (30% - mainly metal recovery) or disposal (2% - mainly landfill) to countries outside of Canada. All of the destinations were signatories to the Minamata Convention. Apart from the US, all were also parties to the Basel Convention. This indicates that, as encouraged (but not required) by the Minamata Convention, compliance with the aspect of the Basel Convention that limits the transfer of hazardous waste to member-parties only, was achieved (Fig. 5  ). However, given that the Minamata Convention leverages the goals of the Basel Convention, which has requirements to avoid the international transfer of hazardous waste where comparable and environmentally sound domestic WM practices exist (with some exceptions), the NPRI data suggest that Canadian mercury transfers may be out of alignment with these goals. Specifically, in all instances where there was an international transfer, there was at least one instance of a domestic waste management option that matched (same year, same WM practice), suggesting that there is an opportunity for reducing/eliminating transboundary movement of mercury in wastes (and/or further investigation to confirm whether caveats for such transfers apply (e.g., the transfers were for reasons of efficiency or other environmentally sound management/disposal) (see Fig. 2 ). An example of achieved reduction in the transboundary movement of mercury can be seen by looking at the trends over time for the international transfers for disposal (see Fig. 4 ), which historically went to the US only (coming mainly from the waste treatment and disposal sector and going to US landfills), but trends show a substantial drop in 2017. This trend coincides with both the coming into force of the Minamata Convention and associated rules in the US regarding hazardous waste import process/approvals (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2023b ). Inputs of mercury to domestic landfills increased substantially after 2017, suggesting that mercury landfill waste that would have previously been transferred to the US is now (post-2017) sent to domestic sites instead. This NPRI perspective demonstrates that regardless of Minamata reporting compliance, actual trends of industrial mercury transfers in waste are increasing domestically and, in some cases, internationally (for incineration, up to 2021), and in other cases are decreasing (transfers to landfill), which represent more direct measures of SDG 12 aims. And though examination of the potential anthropogenic exposures from these waste stream movements is beyond scope here, this NPRI perspective flags that further investigation is needed to better understand whether the ultimate Minamata and SDG 12 objectives of human health and environmental protection are being met.   4 Conclusion While global evaluation of progress toward SDG target 12.4 has historically focused on analyzing release reductions of chemicals (to air and water), here, more attention has been placed on advancing insights on SDG 12 progress for pollutants in waste. These perspectives were not previously knowable with the official SDG indicator 12.4.1, which focuses on measuring the rate at which members of multilateral environmental agreements fulfil information submission commitments, but not actual measurements of intended absolute reductions. By using NPRI transfers and disposals data to analyze both the transboundary movement of chemicals in waste and the environmental performance of several international (and related domestic) chemicals agreements, this work demonstrated the OECD-defined role that PRTR data could play in providing more direct measures of progress towards SDG 12 aims. Specifically, this work showed that despite 100% fulfillment of reporting commitments to the Basel and Minamata Conventions, intended reductions of the generation and movement of pollutants in waste across borders are not necessarily achieved, meaning that SDG 12 aims are not being achieved as fully as the current indicator suggests, or are potentially being achieved despite a lack of chemical reductions in waste. Unveiling this important SDG 12 indicator nuance using NPRI data sets a precedent for other PRTRs globally to follow suit, enabling national and global management efforts to focus on these potential problem areas and advance the understanding of true progress towards SDG 12. Opportunities to improve the substance crosstalk between the NPRI and various environmental management efforts discussed were noted here. Addressing these would both strengthen the NPRI as an indicator of SDG 12 and extend waste-related insights and/or streamline tracking efforts. Finally, because the NPRI (like other PRTRs around the world) is a legislated public dataset, it gives access to these insights to a broad and diverse audience (not just policymakers). Thus, this precedent for connecting NPRI to SDG 12 progress can be a template for other public audiences to do so, which fundamentally supports public participation in sustainability decision-making, as intended by the Rio Declaration, the Aarhus Convention, and SDG 16.
