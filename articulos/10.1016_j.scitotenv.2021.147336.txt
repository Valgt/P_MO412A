                  In 2015, 193 countries committed to 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG/SDGs). Assessing the impacts of policies or actions on SDGs can help countries to improve actions towards achieving SDGs. There is a need for quantitative methods for assessing the impacts of international agreements on regional SDGs. To fill this research gap, we constructed a composite methodological framework, including a difference-in-differences (DID) model (based on the interactions between SDGs), a lag-effects model and a difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) model. Specifically, the DID and lag-effects models were used to analyze the basic effects of the agreement and the effects lag period. The DDD model was used to analyze the impacts of heterogeneity among countries on the outcomes of the agreement. We aim to construct a general methodological framework that can assess the impacts of an agreement on any one SDG. To test this method empirically, we chose the “Belt and Road” Initiative (BRI) and assessed its effects on SDG 1 (no poverty), evaluating data from 20 countries, 15 of which participated in the BRI. The empirical results showed that SDG 1 exhibits spatial agglomeration and spillover effects, and the impacts of BRI may be underestimated if the spatial characteristics are not considered. The BRI appears to promote SDG 1 in 15 participating countries, but the effects have a 2-year lag. The positive effects of BRI on SDG 1 are most pronounced in the 12 upper-middle- and high-income countries among the 15 participating countries. Finally, we analyzed the advantages and limitations of the methodological framework.

Key Laboratory of Land Surface Pattern and Simulation Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing China       Editor: Jay Gan In 2015, 193 countries committed to 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG/SDGs). Assessing the impacts of policies or actions on SDGs can help countries to improve actions towards achieving SDGs. There is a need for quantitative methods for assessing the impacts of international agreements on regional SDGs. To fill this research gap, we constructed a composite methodological framework, including a difference-in-differences (DID) model (based on the interactions between SDGs), a lag-effects model and a difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) model. Specifically, the DID and lag-effects models were used to analyze the basic effects of the agreement and the effects lag period. The DDD model was used to analyze the impacts of heterogeneity among countries on the outcomes of the agreement. We aim to construct a general methodological framework that can assess the impacts of an agreement on any one SDG. To test this method empirically, we chose the “Belt and Road” Initiative (BRI) and assessed its effects on SDG 1 (no poverty), evaluating data from 20 countries, 15 of which participated in the BRI. The empirical results showed that SDG 1 exhibits spatial agglomeration and spillover effects, and the impacts of BRI may be underestimated if the spatial characteristics are not considered. The BRI appears to promote SDG 1 in 15 participating countries, but the effects have a 2-year lag. The positive effects of BRI on SDG 1 are most pronounced in the 12 upper-middle- and high-income countries among the 15 participating countries. Finally, we analyzed the advantages and limitations of the methodological framework.   Graphical abstract Unlabelled Image       Keywords Sustainable Development Goals  International agreement  Impact assessment  Policy evaluation  Difference-in-differences  Belt and road initiative    1 Introduction Initiated and committed to by 193 countries in 2015, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG/SDGs) are one of the most important international cooperative achievements of this century (United Nations, 2015 ). The SDGs will direct global development at least until 2030 (Hák et al., 2016 ). Currently, most member countries have incorporated the core concept of “promoting the achievement of SDGs” into their national development strategies and policies (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2016 ; Alzhanova, 2017 ). National development policies or international agreements (we use ‘agreements’ to refer to policies signed by multiple countries) will have long-term impacts on the achievement of the SDGs. The assessment of impacts may provide clear information for decision makers and stakeholders, so that countries can optimize the policies and better take targeted actions for progress towards the SDGs (Cucurachi and Suh, 2017 ). However, there is little research on the impacts of specific policies or agreements on SDGs. There have been some assessments of the impacts of policies on “composite sustainable development” (e.g., Setboonsarng and Parpiev, 2008 ; Reidsma et al., 2011 ; Gutiérrez Rodríguez et al., 2016 ; Xiao et al., 2018 ; Bakucs et al., 2019 ; Ren et al., 2020 ; Zhao et al., 2020 ). They assessed the implications of policies on a broad range of topics (including microfinance, land use, forest, the “Belt and Road” initiative (BRI), rural development, provincial revitalization and air quality), and were conducted at a national level or below. However, “composite sustainable development” subsumes impacts on and interactions between the environment, economy, and society. Sustainable development will result from minimizing the adverse trade-offs between the different dimensions of the SDGs, and maximizing the synergies between them (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2016 ; Warchold et al., 2020 ). Several quantitative assessments ignored the complex and interrelated nature of sustainable development. Some assessments selected a few or inappropriate control variables (i.e., factors affecting “composite sustainable development” performance), potentially compromising the accuracy of the assessment (Jia et al., 2020 ), since performance is influenced by many factors (Huan et al., 2021 ). Finally, with the acceleration of globalization, more and more transnational agreements have emerged. However, few studies use quantitative methods to assess the impacts of those agreements (e.g., Xiao et al., 2018 ). This study aims to outline and test a general method to assess quantitatively the impacts of any agreement on regional progress towards any one SDG, incorporating the interrelationships between the SDGs. Quantitative methods on the casual implications of policy can be classified into three main kinds. Experimental studies are represented by Rubin's casual model (e.g., Rubin, 1974, 1978, 1980 ; Gans et al., 2013 ; Hanna and Oliva, 2015 ). Time-series methods include Granger Causality (e.g., Omri et al., 2014 ; Long et al., 2015 ; Wang et al., 2016 ), convergent cross mapping (e.g., Van Nes et al., 2015 ; Tsonis et al., 2015 ), and transfer entropy (e.g., Kumar and Ruddell, 2010 ). Finally, observational studies (OS) include regression-based techniques (e.g., Hsiang and Meng, 2014 ) and combined matching and regression techniques (e.g., Setboonsarng and Parpiev, 2008 ; Miller et al., 2011 ; Hallstein and Villas-Boas, 2013 ). Each method has its own disadvantages (Supplementary Information). For the assessment of the impacts of policies or actions on sustainable development, many researchers have chosen observational studies that are easy to use (Cucurachi and Suh, 2017 ). Difference-in-differences (DID) models are an important observational method. Since first used in 1854, DID models have developed (Lechner, 2011 ) to better control the systematic differences between the treatment and the control group (Yang et al., 2020a ), and to analyze possible internal mechanisms. DID models have been widely used in economics (for Gross Domestic Product growth (e.g., Levine and Zervos, 1993 ; Chen et al., 2020 ; Yang et al., 2020b ), wages (e.g., Card and Krueger, 1994, 2000 ; Conyon et al., 2019 ), and labor markets (e.g., Ashenfelter, 1978 ; Heckman et al., 1998 ; Blundell et al., 2004 ), public health (e.g., Harper et al., 2012 ; Sommers and Kronick, 2012 ; Bramson et al., 2015 ), management (e.g., Pierce et al., 2015 ; Bruno et al., 2016 ; Kumar et al., 2016 ), and environmental protection (e.g., He and Zhang, 2018 ; Li et al., 2018 ; Sun et al., 2020 ). Although the application of DID models for “comprehensive sustainable development” has improved (e.g., Setboonsarng and Parpiev, 2008 ; Xiao et al., 2018 ; Bakucs et al., 2019 ; Ren et al., 2020 ), only Xiao et al. (2018)  have used the DID model to assess the impacts of an international level agreement (BRI). Their study has two shortcomings. First, the selection of control variables did not consider the interactions between economic, social and environmental sustainability. Second, “sustainable development” is affected by many factors, and their study only used three control variables (location, income level and social stability), potentially omitting important variables. Using DID models to assess cause-effect relationships between policies and their outcomes on SDGs remains a challenge (Cucurachi and Suh, 2017 ). Such analyses are made difficult by the complexity of interactions between SDGs, the data requirements and assumptions required for formal experiments, and the global nature of SDGs. Thus, to assess quantitatively the impacts of specific agreements on regional SDGs based on the interrelationships between 17 SDGs, we built a composite assessment framework (Section 2 ), including a DID model (based on the assessment of interrelationships between 17 SDGs), a lag-effects model, and a difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) model. This framework aims to be useful for assessing the impacts of any agreement on any one SDG (or on each SDG in turn, providing a comprehensive assessment of the impacts of that agreement on SDGs). To test the effectiveness of this assessment framework, we conducted an empirical evaluation (Section 3 ) of the “Belt and Road” agreement, illustrating the system's operation by focusing on SDG 1 (no poverty) in 20 countries. Finally, we discussed the advantages and limitations of this assessment framework (Section 4 ).  2 Methodological framework This study aims to construct a general methodological framework that can be used to assess the impacts of an agreement on any one SDG. The methods include three interrelated models and robustness tests (Fig. 1  ). 2.1 DID model We use four steps to clarify the interactions between a focal SDG and the other 16 SDGs (interactions can be synergistic, neutral, uncertain, or trade-off) (Section 2.1.1 ). Then, based on the interactions between SDGs, we construct the DID model (Eq. (1) ) (Ashenfelter and Card, 1985 ) to provide a baseline assessment.(1) Y it  = β 0  + β 1  × treat i  × post it  + γ × X it  + γ i  + σ t  + ε it      In Eq. (1) , Y it   is the dependent variable (the SDG to be assessed) that represents the value of the outcome observed for the country i  at time t  (t  can be yearly, quarterly or monthly). β 0  is the regression constant; treat i   is the dummy variable of the group that indicates whether country i  officially signed the agreement at a specified time (the unit of the time should be the same as the unit of the time t ). If yes, the country belongs to the treatment group, and its dummy variable treat i   = 1; if not, the country belongs to the control group, and its dummy variable treat i   = 0. post it   is the dummy variable representing the implementation time of the signed agreement (the unit of the time should be the same as the unit of the time t ). Starting from this time, the value of post it   is 1 for the treatment group and is 0 for the control group. For the treatment group, the magnitude of the coefficient β 1  reflects the net effects of the agreement. X it   represents the control variables (the other SDGs which influence the focal SDG). We control the regional effect γ i   and the time effect σ t   in the regression; ε it   is random error, which we assume is independent of the control variables. The values of Y it   and X it   are standardized between 0 and 1 (without units). Although the unit of t  can be year or quarter or month, in our applications, we set time units in the models to a year due to data availability. 2.1.1 Choosing the variables and calculating their values The accuracy of the results is affected by the selection of variables. Simple qualitative selection may overlook important control variables that interact with the dependent variable. In the following four subsections, we outline our procedures for selecting and calculating variables (Fig. 2  ). 2.1.1.1 Choosing the dependent variable and its initial control variables The methodological framework aims to apply in the context of SDGs to assess the impacts of the agreement on any one SDG. Therefore, after selecting a focal SDG (i.e., the dependent variable), we select control variables from the other SDGs, which means we assume that there are no omitted variables. Specifically, we assess the interrelationships between this SDG and the other 16 SDGs qualitatively (within categories reflecting synergy, neutral, uncertain, or trade-off). The SDGs that influence the focal SDG (i.e., non-neutral interrelationships) are selected initially as control variables.  2.1.1.2 Calculating the values of variables To calculate the values of the dependent variable and its control variables, we use the following five steps. First, compile a set of indicators that can assess 17 SDGs. Indicator sources can include existing recommended indicators lists. For practicality, the set needs to be adjusted according to the data availability. Since SDGs were proposed globally, it is necessary to collect data from many countries across regions to increase the broad application of the indicator framework. Specifically, we collect the time-series data, then, for each indicator in turn, we simultaneously compare the data of all countries, and delete the indicators that not all countries have at least one year of data. Eventually, all countries' indicators are same, and each indicator of each country has at least one year of data. Thus, this new indicator framework can be further used in the second step. Second, for the SDGs selected as the dependent and control variables, indicators from the indicator framework are used to calculate their values. For the time-series data of each indicator of each country, we use boxplots (Tukey, 1970, 1977 ) to test outliers sequentially (Frigge et al., 1989 ). Notably, each test sample should contain at least five or more data points (Krzywinski and Altman, 2014 ). After testing, outliers are deleted. Furthermore, since complete time-series data are essential for constructing assessment models (Little and Rubin, 2002 ), we need to interpolate the missing data (Sachs et al., 2018 ). Since different SDGs studies have not agreed with a unified standard for data interpolation, researchers need to make their own choices. We recommend researchers to use a combination of various interpolation and prediction simulation methods (Supplementary Information). Third, we use the method of linear extremum standardization (Zhu et al., 2019 ) to normalize the data (after interpolation), to account for the different scales and directions of the indicators, resulting in values for each indicator within the interval [0,1]. Specifically, we use Eq. (2)  for the positive indicator (the higher data value of the indicator, the better performance of sustainable development), Eq. (3)  for the negative indicator (the lower data value of the indicator, the better performance of sustainable development), and Eq. (4)  for the moderate indicator (for which, values closer to a nominated quantity represent better performance), respectively.(2) y ijk  = x ijk  − x i min   x i max  − x i min       (3) y ijk  = x i max  − x ijk   x i max  − x i min       (4) y ijk  = 1 − x q  − x ijk   max x q  − x i min   x i max  − x q      , x ijk  < x q    1 − x ijk  − x q   max x q  − x i min   x i max  − x q      , x ijk  > x q     1 ,  x ij  = x q           In Eqs. (2)–(4) , y ijk   is the data value of indicator i  for country j  in the year k  after normalization; x ijk   represents the data value of the indicator i  for the country j  in the year k ; x i  min   and x i  max   represent the minimum and maximum data values of the indicator i  for all countries in all years, respectively; x q   is the moderate (nominated) data value for a moderate indicator. Fourth, the weight for an indicator is a quantitative expression relative to the importance of other indicators (Böhringer and Jochem, 2007 ). Since SDGs studies have not agreed with a unified standard for weighting, we use the widely used improved entropy method (Huan et al., 2021 ) for weighting the indicators of each variable based on the normalized data (Eqs. (5)–(8) ). If there is only 1 indicator for calculating a variable, the weight of this indicator equals 1.(5) s ijk  = y ijk  ∑ j = 1  n  y ijk       (6) e i  = − ∑ j = 1  n  s ijk  ln s ijk   ln n      (7) g i  = 1 − e i     (8) w i  = g i  ∑ i = 1  m  g i        In Eqs. (5)–(8) , s ijk   is the proportion of y ijk   in indicator i ; e i   is the entropy value of the indicator i ; g i   is the information utility value of the indicator i ; w i   is the weight of the indicator i . The other variables in Eqs. (5)–(8)  are the same as in Eqs. (2)–(4) . Fifth, we use the arithmetic mean to aggregate indicators' values to calculate each variable (Eq. (9) ).(9) Goal jk  = ∑ i = 1  n  w i  y ijk      In Eq. (9) , Goal jk   is the value of a variable for country j  in the year k . The other variables in Eq. (9)  are the same as in Eqs. (2)–(8) .  2.1.1.3 Sensitivity analysis of the values of the variables We conduct a sensitivity analysis (Turner et al., 1994 ) by applying a widely used sensitivity index (Liu and Ashton, 1998 ) (Eq. (10) ).(10) SI = MGoal jk  − Goal jk   Goal jk   My ijk  − y ijk   y ijk        In Eq. (10) , My ijk   represents the modified normalized data value of the indicator i  for the country j  in the year k ; MGoal jk   represents the value of a variable for the country j  in the year k  under a modified condition caused by the change in the value of indicator i  for the country j  in the year k ; SI  represents the change in the score of a variable due to the change in the data value of a given indicator. We separately decrease and increase the value for each indicator by 10% for all countries and recalculate their scores of variables.  2.1.1.4 Finalizing the variables The following two tests are required to determine the final selection and use of variables. First, we may not be able to determine that the appropriate control variables were selected through qualitative screening in Section 2.1.1.1 . To outline the mechanism of the interactions between variables more explicitly, after obtaining the variables values, we use Spearman rank correlation coefficients (ρ) as an auxiliary method to verify the interrelationships between the dependent variable and each of the control variables quantitatively. We assume that values for Spearman rank correlations of 0.5 < ρ ≤ 1 and −1 ≤ ρ < − 0.5 indicate a synergy and a trade-off between two variables, respectively; the value in the interval −0.5 ≤ ρ ≤ 0.5 represents an uncertain interrelationship between two variables (Warchold et al., 2020 ). Second, to ensure the independence of the control variables, it is necessary to test whether there is multicollinearity among them using the variance inflation factors (VIF). If the value of a variable's VIF is greater than 10, it is considered that the variable has multicollinearity with others (O'Brien, 2007 ), and the variable needs to be dropped, otherwise it is impossible to run the regression.   2.1.2 Tests before the model is used Only stable time-series data can be used for regression, to avoid the problem of pseudo-regression (Giles, 2007 ). The unit root test can be used for assessing whether the time-series data of variables are stable (i.e., by testing whether there are unit roots in the time-series data). We use the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) (Schwarz, 1978 ) to test (if the p value > 0.1, we conclude there is a unit root). In general, a unit root can be eliminated by the difference method. However, if both the dependent variable and a control variable have unit roots, and the unit root processes are the same, there is cointegration between variables, and there is no need to eliminate the unit roots. We use Kao (1999)  method for the cointegration test. If the p value < 0.1, there is cointegration between variables. The critical prerequisite for using the DID model is that the treatment group and the control group must satisfy the common trend assumption before implementing the agreement (Yang et al., 2020a ). That is, if the agreement is not implemented, there is no systematic difference in the trends of the dependent variable values of two groups over time (the gap should be generally within 10%). In this way, the DID model can provide unbiased effect estimates. Specifically, we calculate the dependent variable's average values for the treatment group and the control group in each year, and compare the trends of the average values of two groups to test whether the common trend assumption is met (Xiao et al., 2018 ).  2.1.3 Propensity score matching Countries do not randomly participate in an agreement. The reason might be related to the country's original sustainable development performance and the quality of its institutions. Since these characteristics are possibly dynamic, the country fixed effects cannot control it, and may results in selection bias (Cucurachi and Suh, 2017 ). The propensity score matching (PSM) approach (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983 ) is widely used to minimize such confounding factors (endogeneity) (e.g., Blackman and Naranjo, 2012 ; Stuart et al., 2014 ; Bakucs et al., 2019 ; Cheng et al., 2019 ). The propensity score is a conditional probability that a country is assigned to the treatment group. Generally, it is estimated by using the logit regression with the covariates gathered from the countries as X  (non-treatment variables such as the countries' background characteristics) and countries' statuses on the treatment variable as Y  (Setboonsarng and Parpiev, 2008 ). The estimated propensity scores abstract these covariates information. Using these scores, we can match a country from the treatment group with a country from the control group to balance two groups (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1985 ). Thus, we introduce PSM into our model (i.e., PSM-DID model) as follows: 1. perform the logit regression on the control variables through the dummy variable treat  to calculate the propensity score; 2. use the kernel density function to generate the weights for matching; 3. check whether the distribution of every matched variable between the treatment group and the control group becomes balanced (i.e., balance test), and calculate the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT). Control variables that still have significant differences between two groups after matching are removed. Two assumptions of the PSM application should be satisfied. First, there is a conditional independence assumption (for a given set of covariates, participation is independent of potential outcomes) (Rosenbaum, 1984 ). Second, the ATT is only defined within the region of common support (Bakucs et al., 2019 ). In empirical research, for variables with unit roots, if they pass the cointegration test, they do not need to be matched.   2.2 Lag-effects model Since the impacts of an agreement may have a lag period, we used Eq. (11)  to evaluate this lag effect.(11) Y it  = β 0  + ∑ n = 1  2  β n  × treat i  × post i t − opentime i    = n     × Z i  + γ × X it  + γ i  + σ t  + ε it      In Eq. (11) , opentime i   is the year when country i  officially signed the agreement (as mentioned before, the unit is uniformly set to a year). n  is the difference between the year t  and the year when the countries formally signed the agreement; when n  > 0, post i   = 1, otherwise post i   = 0. The other variables in Eq. (11)  are the same as in Eq. (1) . In particular, β n   reflects the lag effects of the agreement's impacts. If β n   is significant, it indicates that the impact of the agreement on the dependent variable has a lag period n .  2.3 DDD model Countries can be classified by characteristics such as the different income levels or the country size. To further analyze the impacts of the agreement on an SDG in countries with different characteristics, we introduce new feature variables and expand the DID model (Eq. (1) ) to the DDD model (Eq. (12) ) (Angrist and Pischke, 2009 ).(12) Y it  = β 0  + β 1  × treat i  × post it  × Z i  + γ × X it  + γ i  + σ t  + ε it      In Eq. (12) , Z i   is the characteristic classification variable for each country, i . Taking income level as an example of heterogeneity, Z i   includes three dummy variables; the dummy variable LLMI represents low- and lower-middle-income countries (for countries belonging to this income level, LLMI equals 1, if not, LLMI equals 0); UPI represents upper-middle-income countries (if the country belongs to this income level, UPI equals 1, if not, UPI equals 0); HI represents high-income countries (if the country belongs to this level, HI equals 1, otherwise HI equals 0). β 1  reflects net effects of the agreement on the dependent variable for countries with specific features. The other variables in Eq. (12)  are the same as in Eq. (1) .  2.4 Robustness test Three methods are used to test the robustness of the assessment. 2.4.1 Placebo test To check whether results are biased due to the omitted variable at the country-year, referring to La Ferrara et al. (2012)  and Cai et al. (2016) , we conduct a placebo test by randomly assigning “agreement status” to countries. First, 40% of the countries in the treatment group are randomly selected and put into the control group. Then, we recalculate the regression using Eq. (1)  to obtain the coefficient β 1 . The randomization ensures that this coefficient's value should be 0, which means no significant effects. Second, to avoid contamination by rare events, we repeat the first step 5000 times. If 5000 random coefficients conform to a normal distribution with mean of 0, the baseline results pass the placebo test.  2.4.2 Spatial autoregressive DID model Considering the dependent variable has potential spatial correlation (e.g., economic activities (SDG 8) or climate change (SDG 13)) and spillover effects (e.g., air pollution in one country can affect neighboring countries) (Xiao et al., 2020 ), we re-assess the impacts of the agreement, to compare and modify the baseline results obtained by using the DID model. First, we test the global spatial correlation of the dependent variable by calculating Moran's I (Moran, 1950 ) and test its local spatial correlation by drawing the local Moran's I scatterplot (Anselin, 1995 ). Values of −1 < Moran ′s I  < 0 and 0 < Moran ′s I  < 1 represent negative and positive spatial correlations, respectively. Moran ′s I  = 0 indicates that the spatial correlation is random. If the results indicate that there is significant spatial correlation in the dependent variable, we conduct a second step, that is, to consider the spatial characteristics of the dependent variable when assessing the impacts of the agreement on the dependent variable. Second, the spatial autoregressive model (SAR) is one of the most basic spatial econometric models for correcting spatial dependence problems (Anselin, 1988 ; Fang et al., 2015 ). Referring to Dubé et al. (2014) , Zhang et al. (2018) , and Xiao et al. (2020) , we combine the SAR and DID to construct a spatial DID model (i.e., SAR-DID model) (Eq. (13) ) to re-assess the impacts of the agreement.(13) Y it  = ρ ∑ j = 1  20  w ij  Y jt  + β 1  × treat i  × post it  + γ × X it  + γ i  + σ t  + ε it      In Eq. (13) , w  is the spatial weight matrix. Since there is no unified standard, we set it based on the inverse distance weight matrix and assume that the correlation pattern is reflected in centroid distances. The value of w ij   is equal to the reciprocal of the centroid distances between country i  and country j . If i  equals j , the value of w ij   is 0. ρ  is the spatial autoregressive coefficient, representing the spatial dependence degree of the dependent variable. When ρ  is significant, it denotes that the dependent variable has spatial spillover effects, that is, the baseline results obtained by using Eq. (1)  are biased, and the assessment results obtained by using the SAR-DID model should be adopted. The magnitude of the coefficient β 1  reflects the net effects of the agreement when the spatial effects of the dependent variable are considered. The other variables in Eq. (13)  are the same as in Eq. (1) .  2.4.3 Changing the study region It is important to experiment with different treatment and control groups and check how the results change (Yang et al., 2020a ). Thus, we use a new study region (selecting different countries) and re-assess by using previous three models (Eqs. (1), (11), and (12) ). If the results are similar (the β 1  is significantly positive or negative), the previous baseline assessment results are robust.    3 Empirical research BRI was initiated by China in 2013, with an overall goal of building “a community with a shared future for mankind”. Although the progress of BRI and SDGs inevitably influence each other (Yin, 2019 ), there are few quantitative assessments of the impacts of the BRI on SDGs. Such analyses could help countries to proceed the future “Belt and Road” construction, to enhance performance towards SDGs. Furthermore, the implementation of the “Belt and Road” agreements formally signed by the participating countries constitutes a policy experiment (Xiao et al., 2018 ). Therefore, we use it to test empirically the effectiveness of the methodological framework we constructed. Two types of the agreements were signed by different countries when they joined the BRI. They include agreements for comprehensive cooperation between two countries, and agreements for the cooperation on a specific aspect (e.g., trade or investment). We only focus on assessing the impacts of the comprehensive cooperation agreements, and we refer to them collectively as the “Belt and Road” agreement. The methodological framework we constructed aims to assess the impacts of an agreement on any one SDG. We selected SDG 1 (no poverty) as our focus (i.e., the dependent variable) because the BRI particularly aims to provide opportunities for poverty reduction and economic growth (Yin, 2019 ). In addition, among 17 SDGs, SDG 1 is a core goal (International Council for Science and International Social Sciences Council, 2015 ; Pradhan et al., 2017 ; Lusseau and Mancini, 2019 ). 3.1 Mechanism and hypotheses 3.1.1 Hypothesis 1 SDG 1 (no poverty) contains 7 targets (United Nations, 2015 ). BRI can influence them in different ways (see specific analyses of the mechanism in Supplementary Information). Thus, this context underpins hypothesis 1: the BRI can significantly promote progress towards SDG 1 in the 15 participating countries.  3.1.2 Hypothesis 2 Countries with different economic development levels or income levels have different cooperation models and outcomes when participating in BRI (Tian and Li, 2019 ). A sound policy system is prerequisite for positive impacts from BRI projects (e.g., constructing the transportation corridors) (World Bank, 2019 ). Middle- and high-income countries have significantly better performance in this regard (see specific analyses of the mechanism in Supplementary Information). Thus, this context underpins hypothesis 2: among the 15 participating countries, the positive effects of BRI on SDG 1 are most pronounced in the 12 upper-middle- and high-income countries.   3.2 Empirical methods We use the three models (Eqs. (1), (11) and (12) ) constructed in Section 2  to conduct the empirical research. Several details of the methods are further described in the following 5 subsections. 3.2.1 Choosing the variables and calculating their values As mentioned above, we chose SDG 1 (no poverty) as the dependent variable. Since 2015, research on the interactions between SDGs has focused mainly on building a network of interrelationships (e.g., International Council for Science and International Social Sciences Council, 2015 ; Le Blanc, 2015 ; Zhou et al., 2017 ; International Resource Panel, 2019 ; Lusseau and Mancini, 2019 ; Dawes, 2020 ) and analyzing the degree of interactions (e.g., Vladimirova and Le Blanc, 2015 ; Coopman et al., 2016 ; Nilsson et al., 2016 ; International Council for Science, 2017 ; Le Blanc et al., 2017 ; Pradhan et al., 2017 ; Weitz et al., 2018 ; Hickel, 2019 ). This work shows that SDG 1 is a core goal among all SDGs. Its achievement can have compounding positive effects on the other SDGs (especially in low-income countries) (Lusseau and Mancini, 2019 ), and the achievement of SDGs 2–17 can also promote SDG 1 (International Council for Science and International Social Sciences Council, 2015 ; Pham-Truffert et al., 2020 ; Warchold et al., 2020 ). Thus, we chose SDGs 2–17 as the control variables. Using the methods constructed in Section 2.1.1 , we calculated the values of variables to test the suitability and finalize variables selection. First, to compile a set of indicators to assess the 17 SDGs, we chose as many evaluation indicators as possible from three sources (SDGs global indicator framework provided by the United Nations Statistics Division (Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators, 2019 ; United Nations, 2019 ), the World Development Indicators provided by the World Bank (World Bank, 2020a ), and the Sustainable Development Report 2019 (Sachs et al., 2019 )). To broaden the application of the indicator framework, we collected data from 34 countries located in different regions (Table S1) between 2000 and 2019 (also from the above three sources) (Supplementary Information). Based on data availability, the indicator framework was then adjusted (Table S2). It includes 45 indicators for each country (there is at least one year of data for each indicator for each country). Since 17 SDGs were chose as variables, these 45 indicators can be used to calculate their values. Fig. S1  and Table S3 show the data availability (Supplementary Information). First, to compile a set of indicators to assess the 17 SDGs, we chose as many evaluation indicators as possible from three sources (SDGs global indicator framework provided by the United Nations Statistics Division (Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators, 2019 ; United Nations, 2019 ), the World Development Indicators provided by the World Bank (World Bank, 2020a ), and the Sustainable Development Report 2019 (Sachs et al., 2019 )). To broaden the application of the indicator framework, we collected data from 34 countries located in different regions (Table S1) between 2000 and 2019 (also from the above three sources) (Supplementary Information). Based on data availability, the indicator framework was then adjusted (Table S2). It includes 45 indicators for each country (there is at least one year of data for each indicator for each country). Since 17 SDGs were chose as variables, these 45 indicators can be used to calculate their values. Fig. S1 and Table S3 show the data availability (Supplementary Information). Second, we tested for outliers in time-series data, in 1457 test samples. Outliers of 9 indicators were eventually deleted (Fig. S2 ). Referring to Huan et al. (2021) , we used a combination of interpolation and prediction simulation methods to interpolate the missing data (Supplementary Information). Second, we tested for outliers in time-series data, in 1457 test samples. Outliers of 9 indicators were eventually deleted (Fig. S2). Referring to Huan et al. (2021) , we used a combination of interpolation and prediction simulation methods to interpolate the missing data (Supplementary Information). Third, to verify the suitability of selected variables (Section 2.1.2 ), we used the data from 34 countries to calculate the values of 17 variables for each country from 2000 to 2019 (Table S4). In addition, the sensitivities of the scores of 17 variables to changes in each indicator's data were small (<2) (Table S5). Fourth, using the values of 17 variables (Table S4), we used Spearman rank correlation coefficients to assess quantitatively the interrelationships between the dependent variable and its control variables. Results include synergetic and uncertain interrelationships (Table S6a). It can be further analyzed that 17 SDGs can be used as control variables (see detailed mechanism analyses in Supplementary Information). We also used the values of 17 variables (Table S4) to test the independence of the control variables. Results show that there was no multicollinearity among the 16 control variables (Table S6b). Therefore, we continued to use 17 SDGs as variables. Table 1   presents the descriptive statistics of variables (Supplementary Information).  3.2.2 Selecting treatment group and control group When selecting the variables above, we used data from 34 countries. Since the indicators data availability before 2010 were poor (Table S3), the variables values for the period before 2011 are more likely to be inaccurate. Thus, we used the variables values from 2011 to 2018. Since countries signed the agreement in different years (Table S1), to obtain as many samples as possible, we selected 15 countries as the treatment group, and 5 countries as the control group (Fig. S3 ) (Supplementary Information). When selecting the variables above, we used data from 34 countries. Since the indicators data availability before 2010 were poor (Table S3), the variables values for the period before 2011 are more likely to be inaccurate. Thus, we used the variables values from 2011 to 2018. Since countries signed the agreement in different years (Table S1), to obtain as many samples as possible, we selected 15 countries as the treatment group, and 5 countries as the control group (Fig. S3) (Supplementary Information).  3.2.3 Choosing the implementation time of the agreement Since the agreement may not have been immediately executed when countries formally joined the BRI, we set the implementation time as the year after the signing year, which means the value of dummy variable post it   of the treatment group equals 1 since 2016, and the value of dummy variable post it   of the control group is 0.  3.2.4 Tests and PSM before the models were used The dependent variable and one control variable had unit roots (Table S7a), indicating that their time-series data were unsteady. However, since there was cointegration between these two variables (Table S7b), the unit roots did not need to be eliminated. The trends in the average values of the dependent variable of the treatment group and the control group from 2011 to 2015 met the common trend assumption (Table S8, Fig. S4 ). Thus, the three models can be used for this empirical assessment. The trends in the average values of the dependent variable of the treatment group and the control group from 2011 to 2015 met the common trend assumption (Table S8, Fig. S4). Thus, the three models can be used for this empirical assessment. The results of the PSM and related balance test shows that the distribution of every matched variable between the treatment group and the control group became more balanced (Table S9, Fig. S5 ). Therefore, the PSM-based DID (i.e., PSM-DID) model could be further used. The results of the PSM and related balance test shows that the distribution of every matched variable between the treatment group and the control group became more balanced (Table S9, Fig. S5). Therefore, the PSM-based DID (i.e., PSM-DID) model could be further used.  3.2.5 Lag effects We analyzed the lags of the agreement's impacts by using the lag-effects model constructed in Section 2.2 . Given that the implementation time of the agreement was set in 2016 and the time-series data of variables values were from 2011 to 2018, we tested 2 lags (1 year and 2 years, respectively). Thus, in Eq. (11) , we set n  equals 1 or 2.  3.2.6 Heterogeneity test According to the classification of income levels (World Bank, 2020b ), 20 countries were classified as low- and lower-middle-income countries (6 in total), upper-middle-income countries (8 in total), and high-income countries (6 in total) (Table S1). To analyze the impacts of the agreement on SDG 1 (no poverty) for countries in different income levels, we used the DDD model (Eq. (12) ) constructed in Section 2.3 .  3.2.7 Robustness test In Section 2.4 , we designed three robustness tests. The placebo test is outlined in Section 2.4.1 . For the test using the SAR-DID model (Section 2.4.2 ), we collected data of centroids distances between 20 countries. Table S10 shows the reciprocal of those data. For the last test (Section 2.4.3 ), we re-assessed using 16 countries as a new study region. Based on the average value of GDP Per Capita (PPP (current international $)) from 2000 to 2010 for each country (World Bank, 2020b ; Xu et al., 2020 ), the countries can be classified as developing (Fig. S3b). Among these 16 developing countries, 12 countries were placed the treatment group, and four in the control group. In Section 2.4 , we designed three robustness tests. The placebo test is outlined in Section 2.4.1 . For the test using the SAR-DID model (Section 2.4.2 ), we collected data of centroids distances between 20 countries. Table S10 shows the reciprocal of those data. For the last test (Section 2.4.3 ), we re-assessed using 16 countries as a new study region. Based on the average value of GDP Per Capita (PPP (current international $)) from 2000 to 2010 for each country (World Bank, 2020b ; Xu et al., 2020 ), the countries can be classified as developing (Fig. S3 b). Among these 16 developing countries, 12 countries were placed the treatment group, and four in the control group.   3.3 Empirical results 3.3.1 Baseline results: The impacts of the agreement on SDG 1 (no poverty) The study region (20 countries) was assessed by using the PSM-DID model (Eq. (1) ). Results show that the regression coefficient β 1  is significantly positive at the 5% significance level, but the value of the coefficient is small (0.0162) (Table 2  ). It indicates that the BRI has significantly promoted the achievement of SDG 1 (no poverty) in 15 participating countries, but only by modest amounts (the performance of SDG 1 was promoted by 1.62%). These baseline results passed two robustness tests (Table 2 , Fig. S6 ). First, the results of the placebo test show that 5000 random coefficients β 1  basically conform to the normal distribution with a mean value of 0 (Fig. S6 ). Second, after re-assessing the impacts of the agreement on SDG 1 using a new study region (16 developing countries), the agreement has a significant, positive impacts on SDG 1 in 12 developing countries (1% significance level) (the performance of SDG 1 was promoted by 2.20%) (Table 2 ). These baseline results passed two robustness tests (Table 2 , Fig. S6). First, the results of the placebo test show that 5000 random coefficients β 1  basically conform to the normal distribution with a mean value of 0 (Fig. S6). Second, after re-assessing the impacts of the agreement on SDG 1 using a new study region (16 developing countries), the agreement has a significant, positive impacts on SDG 1 in 12 developing countries (1% significance level) (the performance of SDG 1 was promoted by 2.20%) (Table 2 ). As for the other robustness test, results can be discussed in two aspects. First, 1. the value of Moran's I for SDG 1 from 2014 to 2018 in the study region (20 countries) is 0.103 (and is significant at the 1% significance level); 2. the values of local Moran's I range from 0.034 to 0.068 (Fig. S7 ), and the points (indicating countries) in the scatterplots (Fig. S7 ) are concentrated mainly in the first and third quadrants. These results mean that SDG 1 exhibits spatial agglomeration (significant positive correlation). Thus, the results obtained by using the PSM-DID model are biased. Second, since the results are biased, we used the SAR-DID model to re-assess. Results (Table 2 ) show that 1. the spatial autoregressive coefficient (ρ ) is significant and negative (5% significance level), which indicates that SDG 1 (no poverty) has significant, negative spillover effects (this again shows that the results obtained by using PSM-DID model are biased); 2. the regression coefficient β 1  is significant and positive (0.023) at the 1% significance level, which indicates that the BRI has significantly promoted the achievement of SDG 1 (no poverty) in 15 participating countries (the performance of SDG 1 was enhanced by 2.3%). Thus, results that ignore the spatial spillover effect of SDG 1 will underestimate the effects of the BRI. As for the other robustness test, results can be discussed in two aspects. First, 1. the value of Moran's I for SDG 1 from 2014 to 2018 in the study region (20 countries) is 0.103 (and is significant at the 1% significance level); 2. the values of local Moran's I range from 0.034 to 0.068 (Fig. S7), and the points (indicating countries) in the scatterplots (Fig. S7) are concentrated mainly in the first and third quadrants. These results mean that SDG 1 exhibits spatial agglomeration (significant positive correlation). Thus, the results obtained by using the PSM-DID model are biased. Second, since the results are biased, we used the SAR-DID model to re-assess. Results (Table 2 ) show that 1. the spatial autoregressive coefficient (ρ ) is significant and negative (5% significance level), which indicates that SDG 1 (no poverty) has significant, negative spillover effects (this again shows that the results obtained by using PSM-DID model are biased); 2. the regression coefficient β 1  is significant and positive (0.023) at the 1% significance level, which indicates that the BRI has significantly promoted the achievement of SDG 1 (no poverty) in 15 participating countries (the performance of SDG 1 was enhanced by 2.3%). Thus, results that ignore the spatial spillover effect of SDG 1 will underestimate the effects of the BRI. Overall, the empirical results support the hypothesis 1.  3.3.2 Lag effects of the agreement We used Eq. (11)  to analyze whether the impacts of the agreement have a lag period (1 or 2 years). For the study region (20 countries), although the regression coefficients (β 1 ) of two lagging periods (1 year and 2 years) are both positive, only the β 1  of the 2-year lagging period is significant and positive (10% significance level), and its value (0.0162) is greater than the β 1  of the 1-year lagging period (0.0120) (Table 3  ). Therefore, the BRI has a slightly significant 2-year lag effect on 15 participating countries' achievement of SDG 1. These results passed the robustness test. Specifically, when substituting a new study region (16 developing countries), the agreement also has a slight, marginally significant 2-year lag effect on 12 developing countries' achievement of SDG 1 (at 10% significance level and β 1  is 0.0196) (Table 3 ).  3.3.3 Impacts of income heterogeneity on agreement effects We used the DDD model (Eq. (12) ) to assess the impacts of BRI on SDG 1 in countries with different income levels. The β 1  values of countries from all three income levels are positive, and the β 1  values of upper-middle- and high-income countries are significant (Table 4  ). It represents that BRI has positive impacts on achievement of SDG 1 in countries from all three income levels, but the effects in the 12 upper-middle- and high-income countries are larger (the SDG 1 performance increased by 1.48% and 2.3%, respectively). Thus, the empirical results support hypothesis 2. These results passed the robustness test. When substituting a new study region (16 developing countries), the effects of the agreement on SDG 1 remained positive in all three income leveled countries (12 in total), and all β 1  values are significant (Table 4 ).   3.4 How to better proceed BRI to accelerate SDG 1 (no poverty) achievement Given the potential of the BRI, its delivery could lead to long-lasting positive effects on sustainable development. To that end, it is important to strengthen the strategic coherence between the BRI and SDGs (Wolff, 2016 ), with a particular focus on synergies with SDG 1, which is a core goal of all SDGs (Pradhan et al., 2017 ; Lusseau and Mancini, 2019 ). See more analyses and advice in Supplementary Information.   4 Discussion This study aims to construct a general methodological framework to assess the impacts of an agreement on any one SDG, rather than the impacts of BRI on SDG 1. The details of those analyses in Section 3  are merely an empirical example used for testing the effectiveness of the methodological framework. Thus, this section focuses on the discussion of the methods themselves. 4.1 The advantages of the methodological framework The methodological framework we constructed contains several advantages. First, it can be expanded by adding more dummy variables to help researchers to analyze possible internal mechanisms, that is, whether the agreement's effects in a region result from one or several intermediate factors. For example, for our empirical research, we could explore whether the BRI's enhancement of SDG 1 achievement in low-, lower-middle, and upper-middle income countries (10 in total) are associated with the intermediate effects of the opening of China-Europe Railway Express. Second, the methodological framework assesses the impacts of the agreement on SDGs based on the analysis of interrelationships between SDGs. Future research could expand this framework to select several SDGs as the dependent variables (Supplementary Information). However, since the classification of SDGs may be quite different due to the differences in the core concerns of various researchers, using single SDG rather than different dimensional SDGs (such as economic, social, and environmental) as the variables can help to avoid one-sided and misleading assessment results. Third, we use Spearman correlation coefficients to assist in variable selection. The coefficient provides a measure of the strength of the correlation between two variables that is insensitive to non-linear correlations and outliers (Hauke and Kossowski, 2011 ). Fourth, to ensure the wide application of the models, we recommend researchers collect the data from many countries located in different regions, when they constructing the indicator framework that can assess 17 SDGs. According to this indicator framework, researchers can further select indicators to calculate variables values. The flexible construction steps and principles of this indicator framework ensure that it can change dynamically as the assessed countries and data availability changes and researchers can assess the impacts of an agreement on the achievement of SDGs at regional levels. Fifth, the use of SAR-DID model explicitly tests the presence of significant spatial spillover effects, instead of relying on the unchecked assumption that such effects are not significant. This model can control possible spatial autocorrelation processes over the dependent variable, and the potential omission of latent spatial variables uncorrelated with the control variables (Dubé et al., 2014 ).  4.2 The limitations of the methodological framework Some limitations and challenges in the methodological framework presented here need to be resolved in future research. First, since the methods aim to be applied in the context of SDGs, after choosing an SDG as the dependent variable, we choose control variables from the other SDGs. However, this may omit variables and produce potential bias. For example, development economics studies have shown that the quality of a country's institutions tends to determine economic outcomes (e.g., SDG 1) (Acemoglu et al., 2005 ). Thus, in our empirical research, in which SDG 1 was chosen as the dependent variable, we may have omitted control variables. It is difficult to consider all potential control variables other than SDGs when constructing a general methodological framework for assessing the impacts of any agreements on any one SDG (Section 2 ). Thus, when stakeholders use this methodological framework to conduct empirical research, they should consider other possible non-SDGs as control variables. Second, the lack of data was a critical challenge for the selection of indicators in this study, as it has been in other assessments (e.g., Bakucs et al., 2019 ; Ren et al., 2020 ). It also affects the heterogeneity tests. For example, in our empirical research, the investment size of the “Belt and Road” construction could not be tested. Third, interpolating the missing data may increase the uncertainty of the analyses, and various interpolation methods have different focuses and errors (Huan et al., 2019 ). Therefore, we recommended researchers to use a combination of various interpolation and prediction simulation methods to interpolate the missing data. We also recommend that the steps taken in interpolation and the assumptions underlying each step are clearly and comprehensively documented. Fourth, many studies have shown that the PSM approach can address selection bias (Stuart et al., 2014 ) and make the common trend assumption more plausible (Ren et al., 2020 ). However, several studies have argued that the PSM approach is not much better than using controls in the DID regression, and it may accomplish the opposite of its intended goal (King and Nielsen, 2019 ). Thus, whether the PSM approach that we used in DID model can address the endogeneity effectively needs more discussion. For the assessment context of this study (i.e., constructing a general methodological framework based on regional data availability), a matching approach might be the most appropriate way to address the selection bias. In empirical research, whether PSM can be used to minimize bias might depend on the fit between assumptions in the analytic model and the process of data generation (Guo et al., 2020 ). Fifth, there are multiple methods for constructing the spatial weight matrix of the SAR-DID model (Xiao et al., 2020 ). For example, whereas we used centroids, the matrix can be set by the edge distances between countries. A combination of methods may be considered in developing a spatial weight matrix.   5 Conclusion Effectiveness analysis of agreements can help countries to adjust SDGs policies and their implementation, to achieve those ambitious SDGs as soon as possible. This study constructed a methodological framework for assessing the impacts of agreements on the regional progress towards SDGs. The methods are constructed mainly based on the DID model that considered spatial spillover effects and the interactions between SDGs. Notably, although the methodological framework focuses on regional and international levels, it can be easily applied to assessments at more local scales, depending on data availability. To test the effectiveness of the methodological framework empirically, we chose the BRI and assessed its effects on SDG 1, evaluating data from 20 countries, 15 of which participated in the BRI. The results showed that SDG 1 exhibits spatial agglomeration and spillover effects. Results obtained by using a traditional DID model that ignores the spatial characteristics might underestimate the BRI impacts on SDG 1. The BRI appears to have had a beneficial effect on SDG 1 in 15 participating countries, but the effects have at least a 2-year lag. The positive effects of BRI on SDG 1 are most pronounced in the 12 developing countries, as well as in the 12 upper-middle- and high-income countries.
