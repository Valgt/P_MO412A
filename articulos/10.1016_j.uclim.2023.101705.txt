                  This research aims to investigate the repercussions of an anomalous early summer Land Surface Temperature (LST) surge on food, energy, and human health within the National Capital Region (NCR) of India, with a specific focus on its potential influence on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To attain this objective, the study employed various methods to evaluate the magnitude of the deviation in LST. MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) images were utilized to compute the monthly diurnal LST range, and the Standard Anomaly (StA) approach was employed to account for data dispersion. Additionally, Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA) and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) were conducted to perform regionally specific trend analysis. Furthermore, the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression method was applied to investigate the relationship between StA and crop yields. The findings indicate a significant temperature increase in March, with a deviation of 3.5 °C above the average range. Additionally, the study reveals the standard anomaly (StA) of Land Surface Temperature (LST) during March fell within the range of −0.706 to 2.783 °C, while in April, it ranged from −0.781 to 3.263 °C, and in May, it ranged from −3.001 to 0.525 °C. The key significance of the study lies in the impacts of this early summer warming on the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals. The reduction in crop yields as a result of this warming poses a substantial threat to achieving the SDG-2 target of Zero Hunger. Moreover, the adverse health effects stemming from the early summer warming impede the achievement of the SDG-3.4.1 target. Additionally, the high energy consumption induced by the warming directly affects SDG-6 on affordable and clean energy. The research underscores the critical importance of addressing the impacts of early summer warming to ensure the successful achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals in the National Capital Region of India. Policymakers and stakeholders should take into account the findings of this study to implement targeted strategies that mitigate the adverse effects of early summer warming on food, energy, and human health, and thereby contribute to the realization of the SDGs.

Special Centre for Disaster Research Jawaharlal Nehru University New Delhi 110067 India       This research aims to investigate the repercussions of an anomalous early summer Land Surface Temperature (LST) surge on food, energy, and human health within the National Capital Region (NCR) of India, with a specific focus on its potential influence on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To attain this objective, the study employed various methods to evaluate the magnitude of the deviation in LST. MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) images were utilized to compute the monthly diurnal LST range, and the Standard Anomaly (StA) approach was employed to account for data dispersion. Additionally, Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA) and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) were conducted to perform regionally specific trend analysis. Furthermore, the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression method was applied to investigate the relationship between StA and crop yields. The findings indicate a significant temperature increase in March, with a deviation of 3.5 °C above the average range. Additionally, the study reveals the standard anomaly (StA) of Land Surface Temperature (LST) during March fell within the range of −0.706 to 2.783 °C, while in April, it ranged from −0.781 to 3.263 °C, and in May, it ranged from −3.001 to 0.525 °C. The key significance of the study lies in the impacts of this early summer warming on the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals. The reduction in crop yields as a result of this warming poses a substantial threat to achieving the SDG-2 target of Zero Hunger. Moreover, the adverse health effects stemming from the early summer warming impede the achievement of the SDG-3.4.1 target. Additionally, the high energy consumption induced by the warming directly affects SDG-6 on affordable and clean energy. The research underscores the critical importance of addressing the impacts of early summer warming to ensure the successful achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals in the National Capital Region of India. Policymakers and stakeholders should take into account the findings of this study to implement targeted strategies that mitigate the adverse effects of early summer warming on food, energy, and human health, and thereby contribute to the realization of the SDGs.

These anomalies may result in warmer or cooler temperatures than what is typical for the season in a particular region (Liu et al., 2022a ; Liu et al., 2022b ). The causes of such anomalies can vary, but they are often associated with changes in weather patterns, ocean currents, and other natural factors. In recent years, there has been a noticeable trend towards warmer early summer temperatures in many parts of the world. This trend is believed to be linked to climate change, which is caused by the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. As the concentration of these gases continues to increase, it leads to an overall warming of the planet's climate, resulting in more extreme weather patterns, including temperature anomalies. At COP26 (2021) (26th Conference of the Parties) several important reports and agreements were reached regarding climate change, including efforts to limit global warming to 1.5° Celsius above pre-industrial levels (https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/cop26 ). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a report stating that the world must rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, including more frequent and severe temperature anomalies. Large portions of South Asia, notably India, have been suffering from extended hot weather since the start of the meteorological summer of 2022 (Tasgaonkar et al., 2022 ; Quan et al., 2022 ; Ullah et al., 2022 ). As per the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the month of March was the warmest in India within 122 years (Nandi and Swain, 2022 ). Temperatures in numerous sections of the nation, notably the western parts of the Himalaya, the Punjab plains, Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh, were routinely 3 °C–8 °C above average, shattering several decades and some all-time records (Sarangi and Pai, 2020 ). In the latter days of March, heatwaves hit Odisha, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and Telangana, with temperatures reaching from 40 °C to 44 °C in certain locations (Bisht and Madem, 2021 ; Sikdar and Basu, 2021 ). Positive temperature anomalies are common in this region during the pre-monsoon (MAM) season. However, previous studies have shown that warm extremes occur later in the season, particularly in May and June (Alghamdi, 2022 ; Iordache et al., 2022 ; Pińskwar, 2022 ). Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect-related enhanced warming indicates that dangers are connected to early summer warming are significantly greater in the metropolitan areas as compared to less developed regions (Fan and Sengupta, 2022 ; Liu et al., 2022 ; Tong et al., 2022 ). Since the 1990s, the Delhi-NCR region has experienced significant economic expansion and fast urbanisation, which have resulted in a sharp rise in population of urban areas (Çağlıyan and Dağlı, 2022 ; Singh et al., 2022a ; Wang et al., 2022a ). The National Capital Region (NCR) of India includes the capital city of Delhi along with several other cities and towns in the surrounding regions of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan. Some of the major cities in the NCR region are: Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Meerut, Alwar, Panipat, Rohtak, Sonipat, Bahadurgarh, Bhiwani, Karnal, Muzaffarnagar, Bulandshahr etc. The intensified impacts of UHI on the expanding population of urban areas have become increasingly significant as lethal heatwaves are becoming more frequent and stronger (Yao et al., 2022 ; Wang et al., 2022c ). For instance, the majority of the recorded instances of heat-related sickness through the summer in the NCR region were found in metropolitan regions (Aghamohammadi et al., 2022 ). Early summer warming amplification and UHIs can have cascading consequences on the economy in addition to having a detrimental impact on people's health in regards to increased mortality and morbidity (Li et al., 2022a ; Wang et al., 2022b ). The population of India is particularly susceptible to external heat, owing to the fact that agriculture employs roughly 60% of the workforce of the country, with the majority of work performed outdoors, leaving millions of citizens with the tough choice of continuing to work in dangerous temperatures or foregoing their livelihoods (Islam et al., 2022 ; Krishnaveni et al., 2022 ). The effects on wheat harvests and yields in the districts of wheat-growing in Northwest India, the subcontinent's “bread basket,” in which the wheat harvest time runs from the month of February to May, were a particularly notable result of these exceptionally early and extended hot temperatures. Because of excessive heat, early estimates show a 20% deficit in all-India wheat output this year (Singh et al., 2023 ; Venugopalan et al., 2022 ). An export embargo on wheat from India (from May 13) due to local food security issues is already placing further pressure on world food prices and food production in a tight market due to the Ukraine conflict (Ben Hassen and El Bilali, 2022 ; Benton et al., 2022 ). The extreme temperatures the need for air conditioning to keep houses cool. According to a review of case studies spanning numerous nations, the need for air conditioning grew by around 1–9% for every 2 °F rise in temperature (Alawadhi and Phelan, 2022 ; Salata et al., 2022 ). The countries with the largest rise in power usage are those where most buildings have air conditioning. As a result of the increasing demand, power costs have increased. India had an extreme temperature anomaly in March–April 2022 that had climate change been in effect, it would have been 30 times more likely to occur (Clarke et al., 2022 ). Despite widespread underreporting, 90 deaths were linked to lower wheat harvests, which made the world's wheat shortages from the Ukraine conflict worse (Romanello et al., 2022 ). The entire health effects of lost income, higher hospitalizations, food and energy poverty, together with a glacial lake's outburst and forest fires, have not yet been fully assessed. The NCR region is the second largest urban agglomeration in the world (population: over 28 million) (Dadashpoor and Malekzadeh, 2022 ; Qin et al., 2023 ) and has extensive wheat production cultivation land with high electric consumption (Kumar et al., 2022a ; Guo et al., 2023 ). Several studies have been conducted to investigate how rising temperatures during early summer can affect the achievement of the SDGs, which aim to ensure a sustainable future for the planet and its inhabitants (Howden-Chapman et al., 2017 ; Meftahi et al., 2022 ). One of the primary SDGs that is affected by early summer temperature anomalies is SDG 13− Climate Action. Climate change and its associated impacts, including rising temperatures, have significant consequences for human and natural systems. This can include increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, which can damage infrastructure and harm communities, leading to displacement and poverty. Early summer temperature anomalies can exacerbate these effects, leading to increased challenges in achieving SDG 13. SDG 2− Zero Hunger also affects as rising temperatures can have a negative impact on crop yields, leading to food insecurity and malnutrition, particularly in vulnerable populations. This can also increase economic inequality, leading to poverty and a lack of access to basic needs. SDG 6− Clean Water and Sanitation is also affected by early summer temperature anomalies. Higher temperatures can lead to drought conditions and reduced water availability, making it more difficult for communities to access clean water and maintain adequate sanitation. This can lead to health problems, including disease outbreaks, and can hinder progress towards achieving SDG 6. Early summer temperature anomalies can also have an impact on SDG 11− Sustainable Cities and Communities. Higher temperatures can lead to increased energy demand for cooling, which can have a negative impact on the environment and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, urban areas with poor infrastructure and lack of green spaces can experience higher temperatures, leading to health problems and a decreased quality of life. Climate change has become one of the most significant global issues of the 21st century, with its impact felt across all sectors of the economy. Recent studies have shown that early summer warming has amplified over the years. Despite this, there is still a research gap on the impact of these warming threats on sustainable development goals. The research gap is the need to understand the potential impact of these warming threats on the attainment of sustainable development goals. Sustainable development goals (SDGs) are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030. Early summer warming amplifications can impact SDGs in various ways, such as reducing crop yields, leading to water scarcity, and increasing the incidence of vector-borne diseases. However, there is still limited research on how these warming threats affect specific SDGs. Hence, the objectives of the study are to investigate the early summer warming intensification pattern in relation to the average of previous years, try to identify any potential causes, and also assess how it might affect human health, energy security, and food security in the NCR region. The research methods utilized in this study involved employing the Standard Anomaly (StA) approach to handle temperature data dispersion, as well as conducting Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA) and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) for regionally specific trend analysis. Furthermore, the relationship between StA and crop yields was investigated using the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression method. The novelty of this research lies in its focus on early summer warming amplifications, which have received less attention compared to other aspects of climate change. The study uses a combination of climate modeling, remote sensing data, and field observations to assess the impacts of early summer warming on sustainable development goals. By doing so, the research provides new insights into the complex relationships between climate change and sustainable development.  2 Study area The 2001 regional plan defined the “Delhi Metropolitan Area” (DMA), which included Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Noida, Gurgaon, Bahadurgarh, Sonipat, and Kundli (Kulshrestha and Kulshrestha, 2022 ). The “Central National Capital Region” (Central NCR), which includes an additional 2000 km2  of land in addition to the 1483 km2  of NCT Delhi, was given a new designation in the 2021 plan (Mookherjee and Mookherjee, 2020 ). According to the 2021 plan, the population of the NCR's outer part of Delhi was over 2.8 million in 2001, while the population of the Delhi NCT was 13.8 million, for a total population of 16.6 million in the NCR. The most current population figures ranged from 25.7 to 26.5 million as of 2016 (Guttikunda and Nishadh, 2022 ). The Central NCR covers the following suburban areas: Sonipat-Bahadurgarh Complex, Sonipat-Kundli Complex, Noida-Greater Noida Complex, Gurgaon-Manesar Complex, and Faridabad-Ballabgarh Complex, Ghaziabad-Loni-Bulandshahr Complex. Based on the employment, activities related to economy, extensive transportation, accommodation, social infrastructure, life quality, and environment, the region of Central NCR is intended to be comparable with the region of Delhi NCT after delineation (Kulshrestha and Kulshrestha, 2022 ). The urbanisable lands in this area should be utilized along with these significant businesses. The NCR was formed in 1991 when the urban centre of Delhi was enlarged to include surrounding interstate city regions including Ghaziabad, Meerut, and Noida in Uttar Pradesh, and Faridabad and Gurgaon in Haryana (Naikoo et al., 2022 ) (Fig. 1  ). The landscape pattern in the region has undergone quick spatial alterations as a result of its enhanced prominence (Sharma et al., 2022a ). Housing patterns, cultivation practises, thermal environment of urban region, and urban forest distribution in the city have all been influenced by these modifications, whether they are the transformation of farmland to industry and civic amenities or sparsely populated areas to densely populated areas (Singh et al., 2022b ). Impermeable cemented surfaces predominate in the commercial, industrial, and housing parts of NCR, Delhi, and there are pockets of woodland in the north and south of the city, in addition to very complicated land use patterns. The banks of Yamuna River and the peri-urban regions are mostly occupied with the agricultural land (Patel et al., 2019 ). The tremendous dynamism of landscape alterations on both long- and short-term time periods is made possible by the great variety of land use. The area experiences tropical steppe weather (Roy et al., 2022 ). Arid situations and hot summers are caused by overall predominance of continental air. The average monthly temperature ranges between 3 °C in January and 35 °C in June. Winter (from November to February), spring (from February to March), summer (from April to June), monsoon (from July to September), and post-monsoon (October to early November) are the 5 major seasons in the region of NCR, Delhi (Chalakkal and Mohan, 2022 ). In rural NCR, agriculture is the main activity and covers approximately 82% of the land. Large areas in Haryana, Western Uttar Pradesh, Alwar, and Bharatpur are used to cultivate various food grains such as wheat, paddy, sugarcane, and cash crops, as well as crops like mustard, vegetables, and fruits. In Delhi, crops grown include paddy, wheat, mustard, and vegetables. The NCR is also known for its vibrant dairy activities. During 2017–18, the average yield in the NCR was around 3668 kg per hectare.  3 Material and methods The utilization of the aforementioned data products was imperative for conducting this research, as they provided critical information and insights across multiple parameters. The Land Surface Temperature (LST) data sourced from MODIS (MOD11C3) enabled a comprehensive analysis of land surface thermal characteristics, while the Crop production data from Agro-MAPS databases facilitated a thorough understanding of agricultural productivity patterns. Additionally, the inclusion of MODIS Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data allowed for an exploration of oceanic temperature dynamics. Moreover, the Energy consumption data from Power System Operation Corporation Limited (POSOCO) contributed to an in-depth assessment of energy utilization patterns. Lastly, the Precipitation data derived from The Integrative Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) played a crucial role in examining rainfall patterns. Collectively, these data products enriched the research endeavor, enabling a comprehensive and robust analysis across various interconnected factors, thus enhancing the overall scientific rigor and reliability of the study. 3.1 Land Surface Temperature (LST) data This study employed products from MOD11C3 V6 between 2000 and 2022. The MOD11C3 product is created by averaging and combining daily data from each individual month of MOD11C1 (Singh and Gautam, 2022 ; Tariq et al., 2022 ; Yoo et al., 2022 ). In this study, MOD11 products are more appropriate and were chosen because the values from LST are meant to represent the entire day or night, not just the extreme observation. The products were acquired and pre-processed using the MODIS R-package (MODIS acquisition and processing package v1.1.4). The package is executed using the R software environment and system for statistical computing and visualisation (Team, 2013) (https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/MODIS/versions/1.1.4 ). The MODIS R-package offers automated data processing and downloading, including mosaicking, sub-setting, changing the file format, and temporal filtering. The tool was used to convert digital MODIS Terra LST product numbers (DN) to LST in degrees Celsius (°C).  3.2 Crop production data The Agro-MAPS databases ((http://www.earthstat.org/harvested-area-yield-175-crops/ ) were used to gather statistics on crop productivity, including data on agricultural census and survey information on the acreage and yields of 175 crops. Data availability varies by country, with national statistics for some crops and subnational data for others. Agro-MAPS is the main source of subnational data, providing information from 22,991 political units one level beneath the national and 19,751 units two levels beneath, from 150 and 73 countries, respectively. This study focused on wheat, barley, and chickpeas. The harvested area in hectares was multiplied by the yield per hectare to obtain the overall crop yield in tonnes.  3.3 Sea Surface Temperature data The MODIS Sea Surface Temperature (SST) monthly Aqua MODIS Global Mapped 11 μm Daytime SST Data, version R2019.0 was obtained from the NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG) data archive. The data covers the period from January 2002 to present and has a spatial resolution of approximately 4 km. The data was processed using the MODIS Level 2 SST algorithm, which combines brightness temperature measurements from the MODIS instrument on board the Aqua satellite with ancillary data such as atmospheric profiles and sea surface height anomalies. The resulting SST estimates have an accuracy of ±0.5 °C in clear-sky conditions and ± 1.0 °C in cloudy conditions. The data was processed and quality controlled by the OBPG using a suite of automated and manual algorithms to remove invalid and low-quality data. The data was then mapped to a global 0.05° grid using the multi-scale two-dimensional interpolation method, which provides high-quality, gap-free maps of SST. The final product is a monthly composite of daytime SST estimates, which provides a reliable and consistent dataset for monitoring and understanding the variability of sea surface temperatures at a global scale. The data is available in netCDF format and can be accessed from the OBPG data archive.  3.4 Energy consumption data Power System Operation Corporation Limited (POSOCO) of India, monthly energy data for India for summers 2021 and 2022 has been obtained from POSOCO's official website (https://posoco.in/en/ ). The data includes actual energy supply and demand for each month of the summer season, i.e. March to May. The data was then compiled and analyzed to compare the energy supply and demand for the two summers. The percentage increase or decrease in energy supply and demand was calculated for each month and the overall trend was analyzed. To ensure the accuracy of the data, it was cross-checked with other reliable sources and any discrepancies were resolved by consulting with experts in the field. The data revealed the main differences in energy supply and demand between the two summers. The limitations of the study were also discussed, including the reliance on publicly available data and the possible impact of external factors such as weather patterns and government policies.  3.5 Precipitation data For this analysis, March and April precipitation data from 2017 to 2022 were taken into consideration. The Integrative Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) provided this data (Kim et al., 2022 ). The estimations of rainfall from the different precipitation-relevant satellite passive microwave (PMW) sensors that make up the GPM array are computed using the Goddard Profiling Algorithm 2017 (GPROF2017). Following the gridding process, the precipitation estimations are intercalibrated to the GPM Combined Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) product and coupled into half-hourly 0.1° × 0.1° (approximately 1010 km) fields. The month wise Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Satellite-Gauge (SG) output throughout high-latitude ocean and tropical land is adjusted to CORRA in order to correct known biases.  3.6 Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA) Sen in 2012 was the first to develop an innovative trend analysis (ITA) method that uses a Cartesian coordinate system (Swain et al., 2022 ). The temporal data must be classified into two parts for the ITA technique to work. Eq. 1  (Pastagia and Mehta, 2022 ) is used to represent the actual trend indicator:(1) φ = 1 n  ∑ 1 n  10 X j  − X i   μ      If the number of entire observations is given by n, and the marker of trend is denoted by φ, The data of the first sub-series is denoted by Xi , while the data of the second sub-series is denoted by Xj  and the average value of the data of the first subseries is denoted by μ. The positive and negative values of φ can be used to identify a growing or declining trend.The x-axis in the ITA plot is the information from the first subseries (Xi), while the y-axis is the information from the second subseries (Xj). If indeed the climatic or hydrological data series is shown in the middle of the 1: 1 (diagonal) line, there seems to be no trend. The growing or declining tendency is determined by the location of the information series on the 1:1 line. Whether they are just above diagonal line, it might be regarded a positive or growing trend. The information series is on a falling or declining trend when it is below the diagonal line. If the data does not exhibit a monotonic trend, it enables the detection of tendencies in low, moderate, and high classes depending on the position of the points of data for comprehensive trend identification. ITA offers several advantages in data analysis and decision-making. Firstly, it enables the identification of emerging trends and patterns, providing valuable insights into changing market dynamics or evolving customer preferences. Secondly, ITA helps in early detection of potential risks or anomalies, allowing businesses to proactively address issues before they escalate. Thirdly, ITA facilitates predictive modeling and forecasting, empowering organizations to make more accurate predictions about future trends and plan accordingly. Additionally, ITA promotes data-driven decision-making by extracting meaningful information from complex datasets, leading to informed and strategic choices.  3.7 Method for Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) Many researchershave used detrended fluctuation approach to evaluate the long-term timewise link among previous events and future occurrences (Santos et al., 2022 ). As a result, it forecasts future trends and examines severe events in climatic and variables related to climate studies. The DFA was employed in this work to identify pattern of the monthly LST trend of NCR.(2) y t  = ∑ t '  = 1  t  x t '   − c   ,    where, x (t ′) is the temporal data and constant is c. The latest temporal y is classified into parts L and the cumulative summation for kth part;(3) y k  t  = y k − 1   L + t      (4) z k  t  = y k  t  − a k  − b k  t ,    where, the constants are ak  and bk , the original data is represented by x (t ′), the cumulative integral is defined by y(t). z(t) is the cumulative integral which is detrended. For the parts of K and L length, the variation F(L) of z is computed by subsequent Eq. 5 (5) F 2  L  = 1 kL  ∑ kt  z k 2  t  ,     Where, F(L) is linear in a log–log plot, i.e., F(L) ∼ Lα, and the slope (α), which is also referred to as the exponent of Hurst, is computed by Eq. 6 :(6) G 2  L t  = 1 k  ∑ k  z k 2  t  ,     The ultimate detrended indicator is defined by following Eq. 7 (7) f t  = a t − T   2  − T 2  3    ,    where, the constant is a. DFA is a robust and versatile method that can be applied to both short and long-term data sets, making it suitable for analysing a wide range of signals. It provides a reliable measure of the long-range correlations or self-similarity inherent in a time series, allowing for the detection of underlying patterns or trends that may not be apparent through traditional statistical methods. DFA is also particularly useful in studying non-stationary signals, as it incorporates detrending techniques to remove trends and focus on the intrinsic fluctuations of the data.  3.8 Standard Anomaly (StA) of LST The mean and standard deviation of LST for each month from 2000 to 2022 were listed in order to calculate the standard anomaly (StA) of LST for month of March, April, and May for the year 2022. Both daytime and night-time computations were made based on the StA of month wise data (Equation). For this, separate LST pictures were created using Landsat images for each month that was taken into account for both the time of day and night. Both negative and positive anomalies are possible. Positive anomalies show that the LST of a required timeframe is higher than the mean, and deleterious anomalies show the opposite. Therefore, by dividing the anomaly by the standard deviation throughout StA estimation, dispersion impacts were eliminated (SD). StA was calculated using a raster calculator.(8) Std . anomaly = X − X ¯    / σ     Where, X represents the value throughout a certain year, whereas the mean and standard deviation are defined byX and σ respectively.   4 Result 4.1 Spatial pattern of LST Fig. 2   displays the daytime land surface temperature (LST) during summer months in relation to the average LST from 2000 to 2022 and the LST of 2022 in order to assess the LST condition of 2022 compared to the mean of Delhi. In March, the mean LST for 2020–2022 ranged from 21.78 to 39.41 °C, while in 2022 it ranged from 23.11 to 41.57 °C, 3.5 °C higher than the average. The condition worsened in April, where the mean LST (2000−2022) ranged from 28.27 to 46.26 °C, and was 4.14 °C higher in 2022 than in 2000. May typically records the highest LST, ranging from 30.31 to 45.70 °C. However, in 2022, it was only 0.39 °C higher than the mean, with a range of 23.11 to 50.07 °C. These findings suggest that early high temperatures in 2022 led to temperature rise in late March to early April, despite the fact that the highest temperatures usually occur in late summer. The western, southwestern, and central regions of the research area experience high summer temperatures, with April consistently having the largest spatial extent of extreme temperatures, including the NCR region in 2022 (Fig. 2 ). The standard deviation of the average Land Surface Temperature (LST) at the pixel level ranges from 0.969 to 3.616, indicating low variability. However, during the summer season, there is a high degree of variability due to the seasonal shift in March, with the highest level of dispersion during this period. This high variability is reduced during the summer months due to the increase in temperature homogeneity (Fig. 2 ). The average nighttime temperature during March, April, and May reaches a maximum of 20.82 °C, 25.38 °C, and 27.34 °C, respectively (Fig. 3  ). In 2022, there was an increase in nighttime temperatures during these months, with an increase of 2.41 °C, 1.75 °C, and 0.83 °C, respectively. This increase is similar to the earlier rise in daylight temperatures during the summer. While the regional pattern throughout the night largely remained the same, LST strengthening was observed in 2022. The highest LST variation during the night is often between 35 and 45% less than during the daytime throughout the summer season. Overall, these findings provide insight into the variation and trends in LST during the summer season.  4.2 Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA) of LST In this study, the trends in monthly mean Land Surface Temperature (LST) were analyzed for three distinct months, March, April, and May, during the day and night time hours (Fig. 4  ). The results showed a negative trend for daytime hours in March and April, while a favourable trend was observed for May. However, the trends were not statistically significant at the 95% level of significance, indicating that no substantially positive or negative relationships were discovered between them. The trend slope values ranged from −0.108 to 0.120, and the trend indicator values ranged from −0.406 to 0.346 (Table 1  ). These findings suggest that while there may be slight variations in LST trends over different months and times of day, the overall trends are not significant enough to establish a clear pattern. Further research is needed to investigate the factors that contribute to these trends and to determine their potential impact on the environment and human health. Overall, these results provide a baseline for future studies exploring the relationship between LST trends and other environmental factors such as land use, vegetation cover, and urbanisation.  4.3 Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) of LST The long-term correlations of daytime and nighttime Land Surface Temperature (LST) changes in India were assessed using the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) (Fig. 5  ). The DFA slope was computed for each analysis, with a value of α = 0 indicating an arbitrary method, 0< α < 0.5 indicating no trend, and 0.5< α < 1 indicating a positive trend. For daytime, a strong positive relationship was observed in March with a DFA value of 0.796, while April and May showed moderately strong relationships with DFA values of 0.578 and 0.552, respectively (Table 2  ). In contrast, for nighttime, a strong positive relationship was found in April with a DFA value of 0.763, while low to moderately strong relationships were found in March and May with DFA values of 0.450 and 0.585, respectively. The results indicate that daytime and nighttime LST changes in India show different patterns and trends over the months of March, April, and May. These findings have implications for understanding the effects of climate change on LST, which could have significant impacts on human health, agriculture, and the environment.  4.4 Standard Anomaly (StA) of LST The standardized anomaly of Land Surface Temperature (LST) during the summer months was analyzed to evaluate variation without the magnitude of the anomaly. The positive and negative StA in Fig. 6  indicates heat anomalies with respect to the mean. During the summer months, the StA fluctuated from −0.706 to 2.783 °C in March, −0.781 to 3.263 °C in April, and −3.001 to 0.525 °C in May. Despite the very small mean monthly variance, April 2022 had the highest StA. The north and south eastern regions had several locations with higher positive StA during daylight hours in March and April. In May 2022, the area covered by the greater positive anomaly considerably shrank. However, it was still considered weak for the NCR region as a whole. Nighttime LST StA of the summer months displayed anomaly in the months of March, April, and May 2022, with a range of 1.008 to 3.093 °C, −1.476 to 2.229 °C, and −1.406 to 2.278 °C, respectively (Fig. 6  ). This shows that the magnitude of temperature variation in March was higher at night compared to April and May, which had similar temperature ranges. The overall StA suggests that temperature variability was at its peak during summer owing to seasonal shifts, and the high level of variability was primarily seen in March. However, the night-time temperatures in March, April, and May 2022 were higher compared to the previous year, with an increase of 2.41 °C, 1.75 °C, and 0.83 °C, respectively. The results show that positive anomalies are more common across the NCR region, with a larger spatial growth in early summer compared to late summer. March brings strong positive anomalies to the majority of the NCR region, even though the absolute LST was not too high all night. StA, on the other hand, was rather audible, with lower values throughout the night than during the day. The presence of significant amounts of anomalous was observed both day and night in several northeastern Indian regions. Surprisingly, the positive departure of StA in April 2022 was found to be abnormally high in the north and south-eastern regions, while the entire NCR area saw unusually high positive anomalies in March 2022. These findings suggest that there is a high degree of variability in StA across the NCR region, with different regions exhibiting different patterns of anomalies at different times of the year. Additionally, the results indicate that the NCR region experiences more positive anomalies than negative anomalies, with March being the month with the most positive anomalies. The results also suggest that anomalous behavior is not limited to daytime hours, as significant anomalous values were observed during nighttime hours as well.  4.5 Diurnal Temperature Range (DTR) This study investigated the variations in Land Surface Temperature (LST) range during the summer months (March to May) of 2022 and their impact on the survival and comfort of humans. The results revealed that LST range varied significantly across the study region during the summer months (Fig. 7  ). The LST range in March varied from 6.47 to 23.54 °C, while in April, it varied from 8.51 to 31.02 °C. May showed the lowest range of LST, varying from 4.67 to 21.56 °C. April was found to be the most favourable month. The south-western region showed the highest LST range, which was unusual, as this variation typically occurs in May. The study also observed a positive correlation between the LST range and Standardized Anomaly (StA) behavior during these months. In March, the north and north-eastern portions of the study region had low diurnal temperature ranges, while in April and May, the western and south-western regions showed higher fury. The month of April showed the widest temperature variation, with the highest LST of 31.02 °C and the lowest LST of 8.51 °C. The findings of this study suggest that temperature range significantly impacts the survival and comfort of species. The results highlight the importance of monitoring and managing temperature variations, particularly in the south-western region, to ensure human survival and wellbeing.  4.6 Causes of early warming Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies in the Indian Ocean often increase temperature anomalies in the Indian territory, as evidenced by the present significant positive temperature anomalies (Divu et al., 2021 ; Govil et al., 2022 ) and high temperature amplifications in 2015, 2016, and 2019. In April 2016, a favourable temperature anomaly occurred across a larger portion of the Indian Ocean, which supported severe anomaly of temperature in India's northwest and east central regions. The influence of the underlying local, regional, and global processes on the positive LST StA over the Northwest, Central North East, and Central India on mean StA maps from 2000 to 2022, specifically in 2022. This outcome is pretty consistent with Panda et al. (2014) , Panda et al. (2017) , Revadekar et al. (2018) , and Dubey and Kumar (2022) . Unexpectedly, there was no significant SST anomaly discovered in April 2022. In Fig. 8  , The question of how it happened prompts serious worry in the scholarly community. A hint for comprehending the current scenario came from a regional rainfall assessment of March and April 2022 and the average over the preceding five years. According to Fig. 9  , between 0.342 and 62.168% of rainfall, or 0.979 to −58.606 mm, was observed in March and April 2022. In Fig. 9 , Rainfall in March and April, however, was much lower than the average for the same months (2017–2021), falling by −82.36% and −79.61%, respectively. It may be a sign of early warmth and a record-breaking rise in temperature if there is a significant temperature anomaly and a sustained absence of rainfall over broader portions of India. The NCR is extremely dry and prone to drought because to the high rainfall deficit (Jiang and Zhou, 2021 ; Marengo et al., 2021 ).   5 Discussion 5.1 Magnitude of temperature anomalies in NCR The geographical distribution of LST and StA as well as the current inquiry were calculated throughout the full summer. The dispersion effect is avoided and a more factual result regarding the magnitude of the abnormality is supplied since this approach estimates StA by dividing the anomalous portion by standard deviation. The ITA computation also offered the average trend and the departure of StA by year for the NCR region. It is important to anticipate the possibility of future occurrences as well as the potential for change in the existing trend by understanding the characteristics of the clustering for both positive and negative StA. You may also determine the difference between the StA of this year and past years by comparing the departing value of the year 2022 to other specific years. Subtropical monsoon climates that are dominated by the continental climate typically see severe temperature events throughout the summertime (viz., March, April, May, and June). Extreme heat is experienced in the NCR region throughout the summer, although its frequency, amplitude, and persistence are not consistently observable. However, the north-eastern NCR region is particularly vulnerable to positive temperature anomalies that cause heatwaves. In 2022, the early heat surge as detected through positive StA mapping from MODIS data was 122 years old. ITA analysis revealed that along with the potential areas of extreme LST, the north eastern part of NCR region recorded increasing positive StA both during day and night times. This finding is very suggestive, and more thorough investigation is needed to determine the reasons for this newly appearing positive STA. Nevertheless, the persistence of positive LST and heatwave is correlated with both local and global climatic regimes, including the existence of anomalies in the anticyclonic rhythm over the northern part of India, quasi-stationary Rossby waves, and significant climatic oddities like the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), etc. (Minobe et al., 2016 ; Casazza, 2017 ; Yu et al., 2022 ).  5.2 Escalation of temperature anomalies in the Indian subcontinent In addition, the anomalies in the global climate in the tropical Indian Ocean and middle Pacific are associated with similar LST abnormal conditions. Kenyon and Hegerl (2008)  and Arblaster and Alexander (2012)  describe the impacts of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDQ) and El Nino/Southern Oscillation (PDQ) on the variance of large magnitude thermal anomalies with prolonged duration. ENSO-related warming of the tropical Indian Ocean's surface increases the likelihood that higher temperatures may occur (Yue et al., 2021 ; Pontes et al., 2022 ). An increase of one degree in the temperature of the sea surface can cause temperatures to rise throughout much of India (Weldeab et al., 2022 ; Napier et al., 2022 ). The chance of ENSO being induced by climate change might increase the frequency and severity of such thermal abnormal conditions across the Indian subcontinent (Sarda et al., 2022 ; Kumar et al., 2022b ; WMO, 2022 ). In India in 2022, a high positive thermal anomaly over a prolonged period of time and a water shortage caused by imprudent soil moisture usage served as the context for rising temperatures. The analysis unequivocally stated that there will be a persistent rainfall shortfall in the months of March and April 2022. High rainfall deficits were also recorded by Mandal et al. (2019)  in the temperature anomalous regions of India. A temperature anomaly of >2 °C and such a precipitation shortfall may lead to soil moisture deficiency, which encourages extreme heating. Because there is less opportunity for evaporation when the soil is dry, the atmosphere receives less moisture, which causes the heating of both the surface and the atmosphere (Folwell et al., 2022 ; Dannenberg et al., 2022 ; Schumacher et al., 2022 ). Several recent studies have shown a clear correlation between global LST and temperature of air increases and the expansion of urban landscapes that recover green and blue space (Li et al., 2021 ; Agache et al., 2022 ; Chen et al., 2022 ). Therefore, this transition is highly consistent with the current research topic. The extremes of StA are increased by the frequently suitable climatic background coupled with regional level land use transformation.  5.3 Dissecting the causes of temperature anomalies Strong positive anomalies and abnormal anti-cyclonic conditions over northern regions of India at 500 hPa and 200 hPa encourage persistently positive LST anomalous situations (Xie et al., 2021 ; Diallo et al., 2022 ). One of the main causes of the event of early warming in this area is the abnormal cyclonic and anti-cyclonic circulation in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere in response to the existence of the Rossby wave. The existence of abnormal cells of high and low pressure across the north Atlantic, near Europe, and central Asia, as well as an abnormal low over those regions, respectively, demands an anti-cyclonic situation over northern India, in which such a strong LST and positive StA LST anomalous situation prevails (Li et al., 2020 ; Zhang et al., 2022 ; Sarda et al., 2022 ). According to Perkins (2015) , Anti-cyclone blocking also contributed to significant temperature rise across Europe and Russia. In reality, the blockage brought on by an anti-cyclone prevents the absorption of hot tropical and cold polar air and instead encourages warming of the surface. In the Indian context, the influence of a persistent or subtropical high, as well as the associated flow of anti-cyclone at the middle and upper troposphere, induce sinking movement, resulting in a warmer surface produced by shrinkages in the adiabatic process (Zhu et al., 2022 ; Holden, 2019 ; Qiu et al., 2023 ). Once more, this circumstance is to blame for the ongoing loss of soil moisture and the decline in perceptible water in the atmosphere (Li et al., 2021 ; Sharma et al., 2022b ; Pei et al., 2023 ). Stronger anticyclones, longer days with a balance in positive diurnal radiation and very little precipitation in April 2022 could be the main causes of this unusually strong StA of LST occurrence. Additionally, the development of positive StA in the NCR region is caused by the summer solstice and a positive diurnal heat balance during long days. The situation is horrifying in the northwestern region of India, where the Thar desert, a lack of rainfall, and lengthy photoperiods are present. An important factor in determining the variation of such high LST conditions may be the availability of antecedent moisture. For example, with higher antecedent moisture, the risk of a strong positive StA may be lower this year.  5.4 Recent temperature anomalies effect on food, energy, and human health During April 2022, there were abnormally high temperatures observed in India, which resulted in a decline in food production, particularly rabi crops, which are harvested during this time. The premature ripening of crops due to the early rise in temperature reduces their overall productivity. Kumar (2022)  studied the effects of temperature rise on wheat crops from 1951 to 2015 and found that the yield significantly decreased in Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh by 4.9%, 4.1%, and 3.5% respectively. This research confirms that the relationship between thermal anomalies and the production and yield of crops is significant. As India experienced a significant temperature anomaly in 2022, the consequences for food production were expected to be severe. People tried to prepare for the warming by using air conditioners, freezers, and other electrical devices, but this led to electricity shortages in some areas, as seen in India in April 2022. India had a huge energy footprint, which was greater than the potential of energy consumption, during a prolonged period of high temperature rise in March and April 2022 (Fig. 1  ). Past studies have shown that thermal hyperthermia can have a significant impact on human health, resulting in a variety of medical issues, including death (Taib and Adnan, 2022 ; Jung et al., 2022 ). These issues may arise from heat accumulation in the human body caused by excessive ambient heat and metabolic heat (Błażejczyk et al., 2022 ; Joshi et al., 2022 ). Heat stroke caused by such an occurrence has previously been documented in India.  5.5 Impact of temperature anomalies on SDGs Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) contain 17 goals and 169 targets. The SDGs were created with the intention of going beyond the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and offering a comprehensive framework for future national progress (Joshi et al., 2022 ). If the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are to be achieved by the 2030 target, the risks posed by human-induced climate change must be understood and addressed. Early summer warming is directly affecting some of SDG targets (Fig. 1 ). Early summer temperatures coincided with wheat grain filling and development stage, forcing maturity, causing grain to yellow and shrivel, and reducing yields by up to 15 to 25%. In horticultural crops such as kinnow, pomegranate, mango, and lemon, high temperatures led to moisture stress, sunburn, flower loss, and fewer fruit setting. This is threatening the SDG-2, ‘Zero Hunger’. Under the target 2.4, the 2.4.1 indicator (proportion of agricultural area under productive and sustainable agriculture) has been hindered directly by this reduction in crop production. Similarly, due to heat stress induced physiological health effects, reducing the possibility to achieve target 3.4 (Indicator-3.4.1) by 2030. High energy consumption leads to an energy deficit in India during the summer season. It impacted the SGD-6 on ‘affordable and clean energy’. Under this goal, summer warming directly distresses target 7.1 (proportion of population with access to electricity). The framework for the SDG urban index has 77 indicators and 56 Urban Local Bodies (ULBs). At least one million people live in 44 of the 56 urban areas. 12 capital cities are left, and they all have a population under a million. The 77 indicators cover all 15 of the SDGs; SDG 14 (life below water) was left out since it only applies to coastal regions, and SDG 17 (partnerships for the objectives) was left out because it is not applicable at the ULB level. The indicators span the areas of reducing poverty, nutrition, health, education, women's empowerment, water and sanitation, clean energy, economic growth, industry, infrastructure, lowered inequality, urban development, addressing climate change, preserving forests, and governance. With a score of 67.36, Delhi placed 20th out of 56 ULBs. The index will further improve localization of the SDGs and provide effective SDG monitoring at the local level. It draws attention to the advantages and disadvantages of ULB-level data, monitoring, and reporting systems. This index will aid in the development of an ecosystem where all stakeholders will be prepared to accept and put data-driven decision making into practise.  5.6 Mitigation strategies To mitigate the adverse impacts of anomalous early summer LST, comprehensive and interdisciplinary strategies are required. Implementing climate-smart agricultural practices, such as crop selection, optimizing planting dates, and improving irrigation efficiency, can enhance resilience to temperature extremes and mitigate the impacts on food production (Sikka et al., 2022 ; Zhao et al., 2023 ). Encouraging the adoption of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, can reduce the reliance on fossil fuels for electricity generation, thus lowering energy-related greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change (IPCC, 2018 ). Additionally, developing and promoting energy-efficient technologies, along with sustainable energy sources, can help reduce energy demand during extreme heat events (Buonomano et al., 2022 ). To protect human health, it is essential to strengthen early warning systems for heatwaves and improve public awareness of heat-related risks and protective measures (Hasan et al., 2021 ). Implementing urban heat island mitigation strategies, such as increasing green spaces, incorporating reflective surfaces, and improving urban planning, can help reduce the intensity of heatwaves in cities, minimizing health impacts (Hondula et al., 2019 ). India has anticipated some mitigation strategies to combat climate change impacts in COP27 (2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference or Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC) (Fig. 11  ).  5.7 Study limitations and future research directions LST is the temperature of the Earth's surface as measured by remote sensing instruments such as satellites, and it reflects the thermal energy emitted by the surface. It takes into account not only air temperature but also factors such as solar radiation, humidity, wind speed and vegetation cover. LST The data can provide a more comprehensive picture of temperature conditions in a region’, which can be useful in analysing temperature anomalies. Air temperature data, on the other hand, is usually measured by weather stations and gives the temperature of the air at a given height above the ground. This can be affected by factors such as local topography, land use and urbanisation, which can lead to variations in temperature readings. In addition, air temperature data may not accurately reflect the temperature conditions of various surfaces, such as bodies of water, which can have a significant impact on local climate. Therefore, using LST data in addition to air temperature data can provide a more comprehensive understanding of temperature variability and anomalies by taking into account more factors that contribute to surface temperature. While the current study sheds light on the potential impact of soon-to-be warming on food, energy supply and human health in the Indian Capital Region, there are several limitations that need to be addressed in future research. One of the most important limitations of the study is the unexpected absence of any significant sea surface temperature anomaly for several years, suggesting that the role of SST in regulating summer warming in the long term needs to be re-examined. Future research could investigate this anomaly by analysing data over a longer time period and reviewing existing studies. Another limitation is the use of MODIS data, which provide relatively coarse spatial resolution and may not capture local variability in temperature. The use of higher spatial resolution data could help overcome this limitation and provide more accurate estimates of LST. Moreover, the study only examines the impact of early warming on the National Capital Region of India, and future research could examine the broader regional and global implications of this phenomenon. Moreover, the study only examines the impact of early warming on crop yields and energy availability. Future research could examine the impacts on other sectors such as water availability, air quality and biodiversity. Finally, the study focuses on the potential impact of early warming on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Future research could explore the potential policy interventions and adaptation measures that could be used to mitigate these impacts and achieve the SDGs. Overall, future research could build on the findings of the current study and provide more comprehensive insights into the impacts of early warming on different sectors and regions.   6 Conclusion In conclusion, the study highlights the potential impact of early summer anomalous Land Surface Temperature (LST) insurgence on food, energy, and human health in National Capital Region (NCR) of India, and how it could hinder the fulfilment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The authors employed innovative techniques such as ITA, DFA, and OLS regression to determine the magnitude of the deviation, investigate StA and crop yields, and calculate the energy surplus/deficit. The results suggest that the protracted rain deficit over larger portions of India, rather than SST, was responsible for the unusual summer heating observed in 2022. Strong positive summer StA negatively impacted yields in rabi, and there was an energy shortage in the states afflicted by the heat, with additional effects on human health. Surface heating is typically induced by global meteorological anomalies like the rise in Sea Surface Temperature (SST), but in 2022, it was not the cause. Long days, high temperatures, and heatwaves are predicted to have an impact on food security in India and other dependent nations. Yields of rabi crops such as wheat, barley, and chickpeas were negatively impacted due to the high temperature. Premature ripening of wheat caused a reduction in wheat production, which can have a significant impact on food security in the region. Energy security was also affected in the National Capital Region (NCR) of India. The study suggests that the energy deficiency in the production system caused a production blackout that negatively affects economic growth. The negative impact on crop yields highlights the need for the development of heat-tolerant crop varieties and efficient irrigation systems to ensure food security. The energy deficiency in the production system suggests the need for alternative and sustainable energy sources to ensure energy security and promote economic growth. By recognizing the potential impacts of early summer warming on sustainable development goals, policymakers can make informed decisions to address this issue. The study provides a useful foundation for creating resilience and readiness plans to address these issues and underscores the need for urgent action to mitigate the potential impacts of climate change.
