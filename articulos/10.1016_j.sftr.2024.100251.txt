                  This interdisciplinary study addresses a critical gap in environmental behavior research by focusing on Gen Z's engagement with tree planting, a key yet underexplored activity in the context of achieving sustainable development goals. Motivated by the need to understand how cultural practices and environmental policies influence young people's participation in sustainability efforts, this research examines how integrating psychological theories with sociocultural dynamics can enhance our understanding of proactive environmental engagement. Leveraging frameworks from psychology, sociology, environmental science, and cultural studies, this research integrates the Value-Belief-Norm theory and the Theory of Planned Behavior to analyze how Gen Z's values, environmental beliefs, and perceived behavioral control influence their intentions and actions toward tree planting. The methodology involves a two-phase empirical investigation: initially developing and validating measurement items with 141 Gen Z participants, followed by a second phase with 203 participants to validate the proposed model using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The findings highlight that the environmental value of Gen Z significantly shapes its attitudes and behavioral intentions toward tree planting. Additionally, this study reveals the crucial role of personal norms and perceived behavioral control in steering individuals’ pro-environmental behaviors. The Vishu Thaineetham initiative, which has a global footprint and has transformed a cultural tradition into a sustainable tree-planting movement, is a case study for innovative ecological preservation. This initiative demonstrates the potential of culturally adapted practices to foster collective environmental engagement and promote cleaner production strategies. The implications for theory and practice, emphasizing insights into environmental behavior models, are also provided.

This interdisciplinary study addresses a critical gap in environmental behavior research by focusing on Gen Z's engagement with tree planting, a key yet underexplored activity in the context of achieving sustainable development goals. Motivated by the need to understand how cultural practices and environmental policies influence young people's participation in sustainability efforts, this research examines how integrating psychological theories with sociocultural dynamics can enhance our understanding of proactive environmental engagement. Leveraging frameworks from psychology, sociology, environmental science, and cultural studies, this research integrates the Value-Belief-Norm theory and the Theory of Planned Behavior to analyze how Gen Z's values, environmental beliefs, and perceived behavioral control influence their intentions and actions toward tree planting. The methodology involves a two-phase empirical investigation: initially developing and validating measurement items with 141 Gen Z participants, followed by a second phase with 203 participants to validate the proposed model using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The findings highlight that the environmental value of Gen Z significantly shapes its attitudes and behavioral intentions toward tree planting. Additionally, this study reveals the crucial role of personal norms and perceived behavioral control in steering individuals’ pro-environmental behaviors. The Vishu Thaineetham  initiative, which has a global footprint and has transformed a cultural tradition into a sustainable tree-planting movement, is a case study for innovative ecological preservation. This initiative demonstrates the potential of culturally adapted practices to foster collective environmental engagement and promote cleaner production strategies. The implications for theory and practice, emphasizing insights into environmental behavior models, are also provided.

This research focuses on Gen Z, a demographic trait critical to the sustainability agenda, due to its unique environmental engagement and substantial influence on future trends [1 ,2 ]. Numerous studies have examined the various aspects and precursors of pro-environmental behavior [3 ,4 ]; however, the understanding of Gen Z's engagement in such behaviors is insufficient [5 ]. This study examines Gen Z's pro-environmental behaviors through tree planting activities, representing a tangible measure of ecological commitment and the potential for large-scale impacts on sustainability goals. In 2015, world leaders agreed to the 2030 Agenda for 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), aiming to ensure the rights and welfare of all on a sustainable planet [6 ,7 ]. Despite challenges such as economic downturns, conflicts, and environmental crises, some progress has been made in areas such as poverty reduction, healthcare, and access to basic services since the adoption of the agenda. Nonetheless, the journey toward these goals, particularly those related to environmental sustainability (SDGs 13, 14, and 15), faces significant obstacles. Recent findings indicate minimal progress in crucial areas, with only two out of 36 SDG targets reviewed being on track, notably in mobile network access and internet usage. Conversely, 12 targets, including those related to poverty, safe drinking water, and ecosystem conservation, show no progress, with eight targets, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and deterioration [8–10 ]. Specifically, this study delves into Vishu Thaineetham , an initiative involving Generation Z in tree planting, a cultural tradition that focuses on environmental sustainability. This was initiated by a University Chancellor in Kerala, India, thus leveraging its role in contributing to SDGs [11 ]. The Vishu Thaineetham  initiative exemplifies how cultural traditions can be transformed into impactful environmental actions, serving as a model for integrating cultural heritage with contemporary environmental efforts. This study integrates factors from the theory of planned behavior (TPB), as outlined by Ajzen [12 ] and Conner and Armitage [13 ], and the value-belief-norm (VBN) framework proposed by Stern et al. [14 ] to construct a comprehensive model for analyzing Gen Z's pro-environmental actions. Recent research underscores the multifaceted nature of pro-environmental behavior, revealing its underpinnings in diverse theoretical frameworks. The selection of VBN and TPB is motivated by their comprehensive coverage of both the internal and external factors influencing environmental behaviors. Although other frameworks, such as Goal-Framing Theory and Value-Attitude-Behavior Theory, provide valuable insights into behavioral motivations, they lack a specific focus on normative and control components that are crucial for understanding the proactive environmental engagement of Gen Z, making VBN and TPB particularly apt for Gen Z, whose environmental actions are often driven by a blend of deeply held values and the social and normative contexts they navigate. The value-belief-norm theory posits that personal values, beliefs, and norms critically inform individuals' environmental attitudes and actions, offering a robust basis for understanding motivations behind tree-planting practices among students. Concurrently, the theory of planned behavior highlights the influence of intentions, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control over behaviors, suggesting a complementary perspective for analyzing PEB. The synthesis of VBN and TPB theories presents a potent analytical lens for delving into the cognitive and motivational drivers of PEB, particularly tree planting. Pro-environmental behavior (PEB), such as tree planting, is vital for conservation efforts [15 ]. Recent studies have delved into various aspects of pro-environmental behavior, offering insights through diverse theoretical frameworks. Farrukh et al. [4 ] emphasized the utility of integrating multiple theories to uncover new antecedents to PEB. Tang et al. [16 ] highlighted the significant roles of stringent legal frameworks and community-based initiatives in fostering PEB. Shanmugavel and Balakrishnan [17 ] expanded the theory of planned behavior, illustrating how environmental knowledge and personal norms influence intentions toward eco-friendly actions, such as the adoption of electric vehicles. Duong and Pensini [3 ] discovered that a propensity for prosocial behavior enhances PEB through connections with nature, community, and humanity, while national allegiance may diminish it. In the tourism sector, Gao et al. [18 ] identified cognitive attitudes, perceived behavioral control, positive emotions, personal norms, and habitual green behaviors as key drivers of tourists' PEB, aligning with SDG 11′s aim for sustainable cities and communities through initiatives such as urban tree planting [19 ]. Wang et al. [20 ] demonstrated that empathy with nature fosters environmental commitment and PEB, establishing a causal relationship between the two. Salim et al. [21 ] observed that last-chance tourism destinations, which are indicative of climate change, motivate tourists' PEB intentions. Foroughi et al. [22 ] applied cognitive appraisal theory to show that environmental evaluations trigger emotional responses leading to PEB. Foster et al. [23 ] found that green lifestyles positively impact workplace PEB. Hao et al. [24 ] identified physical stress, environmental awareness, and the complexity of construction processes as predictors of PEB in construction waste management. Coelho et al. [25 ] applied regulatory focus theory to show how promotion and prevention strategies indirectly influence PEB. The urgent need to address climate change and environmental degradation necessitates a shift toward sustainable practices and environmental stewardship. Tree plantation plays a pivotal role in environmental preservation and life sustenance, as trees contribute significantly to ecological balance, climate change mitigation, resource provision, and quality of life enhancement [26 ,27 ]. It is imperative for collective action against deforestation, pollution, and biodiversity loss, aiming for global environmental and social problem solving [28 ]. Cagnoni et al. [29 ] reported that diverse tree planting offers a scalable and cost-effective strategy for sustainable production with economic and environmental benefits. Encouraging PEB, such as tree planting, is vital for reducing carbon emissions and limiting global climate change, aligning with SDG 13′s objective for urgent climate action [30 ]. Whitburn et al. [19 ] also noted the PEB of tree planting and urban nature exposure. This study investigated tree plantation alignment with SDG 13, emphasizing the crucial role of trees in climate mitigation, biodiversity support, and climate change adaptation through natural environmental protection barriers. Koutika et al. [31 ] demonstrated that planting nitrogen-fixing trees on nutrient-poor soils not only leads to successful forest plantations but also yields socioeconomic benefits, including increased family incomes and educational opportunities, in addition to environmental advantages. Sharma et al. [32 ] highlighted that forest management approaches, including afforestation and reforestation, are essential at the local and landscape levels for restoring degraded forests, thereby contributing to ecological, social, and economic well-being and aiding in achieving SDG 15. In the context of university sustainability practices, Thondhlana and Hlatshwayo [33 ] noted that student apathy toward PEB is often due to laziness, forgetfulness, and convenience preferences. Conversely, Suárez-Perales et al. [34 ] argued that environmental education fosters PEB among students with the requisite motivation. Shafieli and Maleksaeidi [35 ], using protection motivation theory, identified environmental attitudes, self-efficacy, perceived costs, and perceived rewards of behaviors as critical determinants of PEB. These findings collectively suggest a multifaceted approach to enhancing PEB, encompassing legal, educational, psychological, and community-based strategies. Notably, Han [36 ] and Gkargkavouzi et al. [37 ] employed an integrated VBN-TPB framework to examine factors such as moral obligation, perceived behavioral control, attitude, intention, and habits, underscoring their significance in fostering environmentally friendly behaviors, including green lodging and general environmental stewardship. However, the literature does not explicitly address the role of tree planting in shaping the environmental attitudes and behaviors of Gen Z. This research gap is addressed by examining 'Vishu Thaineetham ,' an environmental initiative promoting tree planting among Gen Zs in Kerala, India, through a multidisciplinary approach. This approach not only investigates Gen Z's engagement with tree planting but also considers the broader environmental impact of increased green cover, including biodiversity enhancement, carbon footprint reduction, and soil erosion prevention. Furthermore, this study aimed to enrich the understanding of psychological theories influencing the behavioral changes of Gen Z toward greater participation in tree planting. Exploring the research gap regarding Gen Z's attitudes toward tree planting is crucial [1 ], as their engagement is vital for both immediate ecological benefits [38 ] and long-term environmental stewardship. As digital natives are poised to influence sustainability efforts [2 ], understanding and influencing their behaviors is critical for shaping effective future environmental policies. This study integrates insights from psychology, social sciences, environmental science, and cultural traditions, offering a nuanced understanding of environmental stewardship and directly contributing to sustainable development goals (SDGs). It explores how personal values, societal influences, and cultural practices such as the Vishu Thaineetham  tradition drive environmentally beneficial actions. Specifically, the focus on tree planting aligns with SDG 13 (climate action) by promoting carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation. It also supports SDG 15 (Life on Land) by emphasizing ecosystem enhancement, biodiversity preservation, and combating land degradation. Moreover, by highlighting the impact of community engagement and cultural initiatives, this study links to Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11), which advocates for integrating green spaces into urban planning to create more sustainable cities. Engaging Gen Z is pivotal, as its participation in tree planting and environmental advocacy through social media leverages SDG 4 (quality education) by fostering environmental awareness and action among youth [39 ]. This interdisciplinary approach underlines the critical importance of blending psychological motivations with social and environmental actions, showcasing how such a synthesis can offer effective strategies for environmental conservation. By doing so, this research not only seeks to enrich the participation of younger generations in ecological preservation efforts but also underscores the interconnectedness of these efforts with the broader goals of sustainable development. Thus, this study provides a framework for understanding and advancing multiple SDGs, highlighting the role of informed and motivated communities in driving the global sustainability agenda forward. Accordingly, our study answers the following research questions:• RQ1: What roles do attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control play in shaping Generation Z's intentions and behaviors toward tree planting practices?  • RQ2: How do personal values, beliefs, and norms influence Generation Z's intentions and behaviors related to tree planting practices?  • RQ3: What is the interaction between the factors outlined in the TPB and VBN frameworks, and how does it drive Generation Z's pro-environmental behavior in the context of tree planting practices?    The following section discusses the theoretical approaches of value-belief-normal and the theory of planned behavior, how they contribute to tree planting practices, and the study context of Vishu Thaineetham . The subsequent section discusses the hypothesis development and the research model. The following section discusses the measures, data collection, and findings. The study concludes with implications for theory and practice.  2 Theoretical background Various psychological and sociological frameworks have enriched the theoretical exploration of pro-environmental behavior (PEB), each providing distinct insights into the factors that motivate individuals to engage in environmentally friendly practices. This section delves into several key theories that have been instrumental in understanding and predicting environmental behaviors, specifically within the context of tree planting among Gen Z. Goal framing theory [40 ] suggests that individual behavior is driven by hedonic, gain, and normative goals—spanning immediate pleasure, long-term benefits, and social duty, respectively. This theory provides a foundational understanding of the various motivations that drive behavior, which is further enriched by social cognitive theory (SCT) [41 ]. SCT emphasizes observational learning and the influence of social and environmental factors, which are crucial for understanding how digital environments shape Gene Z's behaviors. Diffusion of innovations theory [42 ] complements this theory by examining how new behaviors such as tree planting are adopted across communities (indicating that social networks and communication channels are vital for adopting sustainable practices), while ecological modernization theory [43 ] posits that technological and institutional advancements can align economic and environmental goals. VAB theory [44 ] maps the transition from personal values to specific behaviors, highlighting the progression from internal beliefs to proactive environmental actions. The theory of planned behavior (TPB) [12 ] posits that an individual's behavioral intentions and actions are influenced by their attitudes toward the behavior, perceived social norms, and perceived behavioral control over the behavior. The theory of planned behavior (TPB) and the value-belief-norm (VBN) framework are particularly suitable for our study of Gen Z's engagement with the Vishu Thaineetham  initiative. The TPB focuses on how individual attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control shape intentions and is crucial for understanding practical and social influences on tree planting decisions. The VBN links personal values, beliefs, and norms to motivations, offering deep insights into the ethical and normative drivers of Gen Z's environmental actions, which is especially relevant given the cultural significance of Vishu Thaineetham. Together, these frameworks comprehensively address both the attitudinal and normative aspects of pro-environmental behavior. The TPB provides a lens for examining direct behavioral intentions, while the VBN delves into deeper moral motivations. This integration effectively captures the dynamic interplay between cultural traditions and individual behavioral choices, uniquely positioning it to promote environmental sustainability among Gen Z. 2.1 Value-belief norm theory and tree planting intentions The value-belief-norm (VBN) theory is a framework for understanding how individual values, beliefs, and personal norms may influence and shape pro-environmental behavior. The VBN suggests that individuals' values, such as the appreciation of nature and concern for its protection, form environmental beliefs [45 ]. Such environmental beliefs shape their norms for specific actions, such as environmental conservation, through controlling pollution by increasing tree plantations [27 ]. Individuals with strong values related to nature and its issues are more likely to create environmental protection awareness and attain SDGs [46 ]. Tree planting is one such activity through which one can help increase fresh oxygen, absorb harmful gases, and create a healthier and cleaner environment for the survival of all living species [28 ] and soil restoration from heavy metals [47 ]. As a result, such individuals are motivated by personal norms to have greater responsibility to engage in activities that can attain SDGs, aiding in environmental conservation [46 ]. Individuals with such personal norms are more likely to engage in tree-planting activities as they focus on developing a healthier planet. Therefore, the VBN perspective helps us understand the importance of sensitizing appropriate values and beliefs toward the environment, which can promote tree planting as a pro-environmental behavior. Thus, this study sought to understand the role of VBN in driving the pro-environmental behavior of Gen Z .  2.2 Theory of planned behavior and tree planting intentions The theory of planned behavior is a widely used psychological framework for understanding and predicting individual behavior. The TPB [13 ] suggests that one's intention to engage in a specific behavior is influenced by one's attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control for that activity [12 ]. Vishu Thaineetham , as a cultural practice with deep-rooted connections to nature, can positively affect attitudes toward tree planting by reinforcing the cultural significance of such actions. It can also strengthen subjective norms, as the tradition provides a social context in which tree planting is a communal value. Furthermore, Vishu Thaineetham  could enhance perceived behavioral control by equipping individuals with knowledge of traditional environmental stewardship practices, empowering them to participate in tree planting activities." Therefore, the TPB can predict one's intention to engage in tree planting activities based on one's attitude toward tree planting, one's subjective norms, and one's perceived behavioral control over tree planting. Therefore, individuals who want to help them attain SDGs and a cleaner and healthier environment [48 ] are more likely to have a positive attitude toward tree planting and, hence, are more likely to intend to plant trees. Subjective norms describe the influence and pressure of one's peers in personal, social, and professional circles [12 ] and therefore play a pivotal role in shaping one's intention to plant trees. Recently, there has been increased awareness of the SDGs and the need to create a healthier environment. Therefore, tree planting practices are widely encouraged and hence recognized as a socially desirable behavior in general by all individuals [27 ]. Thus, subjective norms for tree planting encourage individuals to engage in such activities due to the peer influence of working in a healthier and cleaner environment [26 ]. Perceived behavioral control is an overall ability to execute specific tasks and activities [12 ]. If one is concerned about environmental sustainability and allied goals, perceived behavioral control reflects one's capacity to engage in actions aimed at promoting a cleaner and greener environment. For tree planting activities, individuals who are driven by a positive attitude and appropriate subjective norms [13 ] are more likely to have better control over engaging in such activities. By understanding these factors, the TPB can help encourage tree-planting practices by recognizing and resolving barriers to appropriate individual behavior. Furthermore, the TPB can highlight the importance of developing a positive attitude, social support, and a proactive desire to save the environment through a collective effort by engaging in pro-environmental behaviors such as tree planting practices such as Vishu Thaineetham . The synergy between VBN and TPB is exemplified in the Vishu Thaineetham  initiative, where cultural norms (VBN) and perceived control over environmental actions (TPB) collectively drive the tree planting behavior of Gen Z. This integration highlights how cultural traditions can serve as a powerful medium for environmental engagement. For example, similar tree-planting practices are increasingly adopted in different parts of the world. Krasny and Delia [49 ] argued that students must participate in natural campus areas and open space stewardship to ensure sustainability initiatives and their success. Based on their systematic review, Ardoin et al. [50 ] found that different environmental education programs ensure some environmental action for participants, often resulting in enhanced awareness. Zhongguo [51 ] found that creating environment education-focused "green schools" can effectively educate students and teachers and help develop a curriculum that considers environmental conservation. Whitburn et al. [19 ] reported that the level of neighborhood vegetation and involvement in a planting scheme are significantly associated with residents' pro-environmental behavior. Furthermore, environmental attitudes and connection with nature mediate this relationship. Kalungwizi et al. [52 ] explored how to engage different villagers in tree-planting initiatives. Their study revealed that trust and information transparency are key factors in engaging them in tree-planting practices. Based on their systematic review, Othman et al. [53 ] found that psychological restoration is closely tied to one's pro-environmental behavior. Punzalan and Balanac [54 ] reported that tree-planting activities significantly improved students' perceptions of life, the community, and the environment in the Philippines. Meijer et al. [55 ] reported that Malawian farmers generally favor farm-level tree planting. However, a lack of food and poverty constrain their tree-planting initiatives. More recently, Jama et al. [56 ] reported that young people's climate action or inaction is mainly shaped by climate change knowledge, biocentric value orientation, and attitudes toward forestation. Table 1   summarizes the utilization and integration of the theory of VBN and the TPB for attaining sustainable development goals:   3 Study context Vishu, which signifies "equal" in Sanskrit celebrated in Kerala, India, symbolizes equilibrium and renewal, coinciding with the vernal equinox—a time of balance between day and night, as noted by Nishanth et al. [64 ]. This festival celebrates the bloom of the Kani Konna flower, heralding prosperity and the new season, embodying traditional ecological wisdom and the symbiotic relationship with nature. However, the festival's Grangerdeur celebration, including the bursting of crackers, negatively impacts the environment [63 ]. A transformative approach to this tradition is Vishu Thaineetham,  which reimagines the practice of Kaineetham . Traditionally, elderly people give monetary gifts to the younger generation, a gesture symbolizing the transfer of auspiciousness and well-being [11 ] (Fig. 1  ). Vishu Thaineetham  adapts this tradition to environmental stewardship by transitioning from monetary gifts to gifting saplings. This shift infuses the age-old tradition with contemporary ecological relevance, directly supporting environmental conservation and sustainable living principles, thereby aligning with SDG 13 (Climate Action). Typically, the saplings are pomegranate, mango, rose apple, guava, etc. During the last five years, more than 350,000) saplings in Kerala through 230 Vishu Thaineetham  events were conducted in all 14 districts. The Vishu Thaineetham  event brought together communities, academics, and youth in a concerted effort to promote ecological sustainability. This initiative has grown beyond its local origins to become a global movement celebrated in more than 40 countries. The World Malayalee Council (WMC) has expanded the reach of participation to the diaspora at the global level and is now initiated by all 69 WMC provinces in India and abroad in six regions across the world, as well as by several other international associations. This wide-reaching impact demonstrates the universal appeal of integrating cultural heritage with environmental action, emphasizing the initiative's role as a cultural conduit for environmental advocacy. The cross-cultural adaptation and adoption of Vishu Thaineetham  showcase the potential for cultural practices to evolve into influential platforms for global sustainability and collective action toward achieving sustainable development goals. In this era of global warming and climate change threatening humanity, this initiative has revolutionized compassion. It is an inner revolution. By engaging participants in tree planting, Vishu Thaineetham  ensures a deeper understanding of and commitment to environmental preservation. This practical approach to environmental education encourages a shift in cultural customs toward greater eco-consciousness, forging a globally resonant initiative that underscores the interconnectedness of cultural practices, environmental stewardship, and sustainable development.  4 Hypothesis development 4.1 Personal values: Impact on attitude and behavioral intentions toward tree planting Our values strongly influence our feelings regarding tree-planting practices. This is also supported by the integrated Value-Belief-Norm (VBN) theory and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The VBN suggests that individuals who possess high environmental values naturally develop beliefs that support environmental conservation. Such values develop a sense of duty in individuals to care for the environment [65 ]. Such a value system, when it coincides with one's positive view of tree planting, strengthens one's desire to plant trees [66 ]. TPB further complements this by underscoring one's attitudes, peers' opinions (i.e., subjective norms), and the extent to which individuals have control over their actions to shape their intentions [12 ]. Thus, individuals with strong environmental values and faith in the benefits of tree planting for future generations are more likely to have positive attitudes and intentions toward tree planting [67 ]. Accordingly, we hypothesize the following: H1 Personal values positively influence one's attitude toward tree planting.    Individual attitudes toward tree planting can significantly shape individuals’ intentions to plant trees. This becomes evident considering the VBN-TPB integrated framework. The VBN suggests that individuals who care for the environment develop strong pro-environmental beliefs [68 ]. Individuals guided by such beliefs have a positive attitude toward environmental conservation activities. Tree planting is one such activity, for which individuals are likely to have a positive attitude [5 ]. According to the TPB, individuals’ actions and intentions are more shaped by their attitudes, subjective norms, and control over their actions. Therefore, when an individual has a strong positive attitude toward tree planting, supported by strong environmental values, they are more likely to plant trees [60 ]. As a result, such individuals are more likely to actively engage in Vishu Thaineetham. Based on this, we hypothesize the following: H2 Attitude toward tree planting influences behavioral intentions.    The value-belief-norm theory suggests that personal values, along with other factors, primarily shape individuals' pro-environmental behavior. Personal values reflect the value orientation of an individual, which often influences one's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors [69 ]. When an individual's values coordinate with a familiar issue or situation, it creates a sense of enthusiasm with purpose, leading to a positive attitude. In contrast, a negative attitude may result in resistance or discomfort when individual values do not conform to one's situation [70 ]. For example, individuals with high environmental values always have a positive attitude toward tree plantation practices. At the same time, those with materialism may not be concerned about saving and preserving the environment. Therefore, personal values act as a moral lens through which individuals interpret words and develop attitudes, consequently shaping their decision-making and actions. This suggests that personal values may positively shape one's attitude toward tree plantation and behavioral intentions toward the tree planting practices of Vishu Thaineetham . Accordingly, we hypothesize the following: H3 Personal values positively influence one's behavioral intentions toward tree planting.     4.2 Environmental beliefs: Impact on subjective norms and behavioral intentions Subjective norms reflect self-realized perceptions of social pressures and expectations relating to a specific behavior. As individuals strongly consider environmental conservation and sustainability issues, such beliefs may influence their perceptions of what their allied social circles expect of them. Such individuals are likely to feel a sense of duty and responsibility to follow environmental norms and associated practices, e.g., tree planting [59 ]. Cachero et al. [71 ] reported that university students generally have limited knowledge of the SDGs but are strongly interested in SDG-oriented education. They often adhere to and demonstrate environmentally friendly behavior that conforms to the expectations of their peers, family, and friends [12 ]. In this way, environmental beliefs can result in an increased realization of the need to adhere to subjective norms [59 ]. In such a situation, individuals feel obligated to align their actions with environmental values [72 ]. Furthermore, such alignment often creates a desire to engage in actions that conform to the expectations of eco-friendly social circles and contribute to attaining SDGs. Accordingly, we hypothesize the following: H4 Environmental beliefs positively influence one's subjective norms for tree planting.    Individual societal influences cannot be discarded when considering tree-planting practices. What others think, i.e., subjective norms surrounding an individual, shape their behavioral intentions toward tree planting [72 ]. The VBN suggests that individuals who want to protect nature from further damage and conserve it for future generations would be interested in respecting societal norms and favoring tree planting. Furthermore, as these societal norms align with one's values, they enhance faith in such activities [72 ]. According to the TPB, there is peer and societal pressure to engage in environmental conservation activities that strongly shape one's intention to engage in tree planting [16 ]. Thus, as individuals realize that their peers and society expect them to engage in environmental conservation activities, such as tree planting [68 ], they are more likely to have strong reasons to engage in these activities. This societal influence plays a pivotal role as a norm in shaping one's intention to engage in tree-planting activities. Therefore, we hypothesize the following: H5 Subjective norms may positively influence one's behavioral intentions toward tree planting.    Considering the integrated VBN-TPB framework, it can be easily seen how environmental beliefs can prominently shape one's intention to plant trees [21 ]. With individuals emphasizing the need to prevent environmental damage and save forests to arrest climate change [1 ], individuals are also more likely to engage in activities that can increase forest cover [68 ]. Tree planting is one such activity. TPB further supports this by underscoring the important role of attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control. With strong environmental beliefs, individuals are more likely to have positive support for tree planting practices [5 ]. They also realize strong societal and peer support for the same. A combination of all these factors results in stronger intentions to engage in tree planting activities among these individuals. Accordingly, we hypothesize the following: H6 Environmental beliefs may positively influence one's behavioral intentions toward tree planting.     4.3 Perceived behavioral control: Impact on behavioral intentions and pro-environmental behavior related to tree planting Perceived behavioral control reflects one's evaluation of one's capacity to execute a specific action and may significantly influence behavioral intentions [12 ]. With a perceived feeling of high control over a specific activity, e.g., tree planting, individuals are more likely to have intentions to execute the same activity. Their confidence in successfully leading tree planting activities may result in a greater belief that they can safeguard the environment [73 ]. Furthermore, if one perceives that they have limited control over tree planting efforts, the subsequent behavioral actions may be weaker. In that case, their ability to successfully contribute to environmentally friendly action may be doubtful. Therefore, perceived behavioral control plays a crucial role in shaping an individual's commitment to tree planting and their subsequent likelihood of taking concrete steps toward environmental conservation [74 ]. Therefore, one may demonstrate more pro-environmental behaviors with greater perceived behavioral control for the tree planting practice of Vishu Thaineetham . Accordingly, we hypothesize the following: H7 Perceived behavioral control may positively influence behavioral intentions toward tree planting.    H8 Perceived behavioral control may positively influence pro-environmental behavior.     4.4 Personal norms: Impact on perceived behavioral control and behavioral intentions for tree planting Personal norms may significantly shape perceived behavioral control for tree planting. For many, personal norms focus on environmental conservation through increased tree planting [57 ]. Personal norms for such individuals consider SDG issues a priority; therefore, they exercise greater control over their behavior. With a greater commitment to environmental protection and values, such individuals are endowed with greater confidence and belief that they have the resources and capabilities to conserve and protect the environment [75 ]. Consequently, such individuals are more likely to be strongly determined to engage in tree-planting practices. Individuals with suitable coordination of personal norms and perceived behavioral control are more responsible for environmental conservation [76 ], especially for attaining specific SDGs. They are driven by greater confidence in their ability to make a positive environmental impact, aided by environment-based personal norms. Accordingly, perceived behavioral control for tree planting during Vishu Thaineetham  will likely positively shape corresponding behavioral intentions and pro-environmental behavior [17 ]. Recognizing the crucial role of individuals in addressing these challenges, researchers have focused on understanding the factors that influence pro-environmental behaviors. Pro-environmental behavior suggests an individual's actions to protect the environment [14 ]. Accordingly, we hypothesize the following: H9 Personal norms may positively influence one's behavioral intentions toward tree planting.    H10 Personal norms may positively influence one's pro-environmental behavior.    Furthermore, behavioral intentions for tree planting can prominently influence pro-environmental behavior as an essential antecedent. When individuals genuinely intend to engage in tree planting practices, they demonstrate a strong commitment to safeguarding the environment and reducing waste and pollution [66 ], helping them attain several SDGs. Such intentions often motivate them to engage in related specific activities, for example, searching for suitable species and understanding environmental conditions such as soil and temperature, which would help them thrive well [26 ,27 ]. Furthermore, as they express their intentions to engage in tree-planting practices, they also influence their peers’ families and friends to follow them, engaging in collective responsibility for the environment [77 ]. In addition, tree-planting experiences can result in a sense of gratification and satisfaction among individuals, reinforcing pro-environmental behavior as they witness the benefits of their actions. Such individuals, therefore, are more likely to work for environmental conservation and sustainability issues [28,77 ]. Therefore, behavioral intentions for tree planting during Vishu Thaineetham  are a prominent trigger for individual pro-environmental activities, encouraging environmental consciousness and underscoring individuals' important role in attaining SDGs. Accordingly, we hypothesize the following: H11 Behavioral intentions toward tree planting may positively influence pro-environmental behavior.    Fig. 2   summarizes the proposed eleven hypotheses in the form of a theoretical model. It shows the enabler role of attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control toward tree planting intentions, including personal values, personal norms, and environmental beliefs on behavioral intentions toward tree planting intentions, and how this interplay shapes one's pro-environmental behavior.   5 Methodology 5.1 Study 1: Measure development and pretest Vishu is one such festival held in Kerala, India, to celebrate the spring equinox and a rejuvenating period. Some of the traditional events include the process of Kani Konna, the first blossom of this vernal equinox, which is regarded as bringing prosperity. On the other hand, the firing of firecrackers is environmentally damaging. In this context, Vishu Thaineetham  reinvented traditional money-giving to gift saplings. This practice is dedicated to conserving and safeguarding the surroundings and is one of the best international cultural practices under SDG 13. This act has been embraced by almost all countries and supported by the World Malayalee Council and other nations, turning Vishu into an international day for the well-being of the environment and a common determination to conserve and protect the environment. Using an integrated model combining the theoretical lenses of the value-belief norm and theory of planned behavior, our study explored the interrelationships among the different antecedents, outlining their influence on an individual's behavioral intentions toward tree planting. Using established measures after a comprehensive literature review, the author's team developed a preliminary list of items for the deployed constructs in the study. The items for measuring the personal values of the environment were developed by Lind et al. [78 ]. The items evaluate one's moral obligation to maintain the greenery of the surroundings and preserve the forest cover. The items for measuring environmental beliefs were developed by Huang [76 ]. The items aimed to evaluate whether one is concerned about the adverse effects of deforestation, along with the support one received from the social circle for tree plantation. Bertoldo and Castro [79 ] developed items for measuring personal norms. The items aim to evaluate whether one feels responsible for protecting trees and increasing green cover by planting more trees. The attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control for tree plantations were developed by Ibrahim et al. [60 ]. The measures for attitude evaluate one's orientation toward tree plantation. The items measuring subjective norms suggest that one's social circle, friends, family, and teachers support one's initiative in tree plantations. Items measuring perceived behavioral control evaluate whether one can make independent decisions and actions regarding tree plantation initiatives. The items measuring behavioral intentions for tree plantations were developed by Ibrahim et al. [60 ] and aimed to evaluate whether one is interested in planting trees and actively participating in allied activities. Finally, the items for measuring one's pro-environmental behavior were developed by Zhang et al. [65 ] and aimed to measure one's concerns about reuse, recycling intentions, energy conservation, and carbon footprint awareness. The initial list of items was then subjected to an expert review of three faculty members with extensive experience in SDGs and environmental issues and three sustainability practitioners. Among the experts, two faculty members were from management, with approximately 12 years of research experience related to sustainability issues, and one faculty member was from natural science, with 8 years of research experience in sustainability. The three practitioners had an average of 7.8 years of work experience in waste recycling, waste management, and environmental management. The expert panel was given a definition of the concepts/constructs and the scope of the study. Furthermore, they were requested to indicate the suitability of the items for measuring the respective constructs on a 3-point scale (1 = not suitable, 2 = somewhat suitable, and 3 =completely suitable). Finally, the author's team retained those items that obtained a "completely suitable" rating from at least four panel members. This resulted in 26 final measurement items for the eight constructs employed in the study. Subsequently, the authors' team developed a questionnaire in Google forms sent to young Gen Zs aged between 16 and 22 years using purposive sampling in two cities in India, namely, Kochi, Kerala, and Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. Specific filtering criteria were used in the questionnaire to ensure sample representativeness. The respondents were asked to indicate whether (1) they were aware of sustainability development goals, (2) they were interested in saving the environment, and (3) they wanted to participate in activities aimed at increasing environmental and sustainability awareness. After several follow-ups and reminders, 152 responses were received, 141 of which fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The authors' team then analyzed the principal component with SPSS 27 with varimax rotation. Table 2   below shows the rotated factor loadings, with the expected items loaded on the same factor. Furthermore, the Bartlett test of sphericity and KMO satisfied the minimum thresholds (chi-sq.= 3571, d.f. = 325, p = 0.000, KMO = 0.740). Therefore, the measures deemed suitable for final data collection for validating the proposed relationships. Table 1  below shows the rotated loadings. A 5-point Likert scale (1=strongly disagree, 5=strongly agree) was adopted for the measurement items in the pretest and final rounds of data collection.  5.2 Study 2: final data collection Next, the authors developed another questionnaire in Google Forms with the final measurement items and the filtering questions. The questionnaire also included an option to indicate voluntary participation and informed consent to ensure that the respondents did not experience coercion. Furthermore, the questionnaire also included definitions of essential terms, study objectives, and assurance of anonymity of responses. The study did not collect personal information such as the respondents' names or email IDs to ensure anonymity. The final questionnaire was shared with Gen Z students aged between 16 and 22 years living in Amritapuri, Kochi, and Coimbatore of the university who participated in the Vishu Thaineetham . Specific filtering criteria were used in the questionnaire to ensure sample representativeness. The respondents were asked to indicate whether (1) they were aware of sustainability development goals, (2) they were interested in saving the environment, and (3) they wanted to participate in activities aimed at increasing environmental and sustainability awareness. The pretest validated questionnaires were fit for measuring responses from these areas, as they all belong to the same states where the measurement items were validated. The data collection procedures were conducted from July to August 2023. After several reminders, 209 responses were received. However, 203 responses were deemed suitable because they satisfied the filtering criteria. Table 3   below gives the final sample profile. Next, the final responses were evaluated for internal consistency tests using partial least squares in ADANCO 2.3 [80 ]. While our study is theory-driven, the theoretical constructs involved are still under examination for their specific applicability to Gen Z's tree planting behaviors. Partial least squares excel in exploratory contexts and when the research focus is on maximizing the explained variance of dependent variables, which aligns with our goals of understanding and predicting the impact of psychosocial factors on tree planting behaviors.  5.3 Measurement model evaluation The final responses were evaluated for internal consistency tests using measurement model evaluation guidelines set by Benitez et al. [81 ] for partial least squares in ADANCO 2.3.2 [80 ]. First, the reliability of the measurement items was assessed by examining their Cronbach's alpha, AVE, and standardized loadings. All the items had loadings > 0.70 and Cronbach's alpha > 0.70, suggesting adequate reliability [81 ,82 ]. Furthermore, the measures exhibited adequate validity, as each of the average variances extracted for the constructs was > 0.50 [81 ,82 ]. Finally, the constructs also exhibited adequate discriminant validity, as (a) their HTMT ratios were < 0.85 [81 ] and (b) their intercorrelations were much less than the square root of AVEs [83 ]. Table 4   below shows the standardized loadings, t values (significant at p< 0.001), and descriptive statistics. Table 5   shows the discriminant validity assessment using the two criteria.  5.4 Structural model evaluation With satisfactory reliability and validity, the study next assessed the structural model. The structural model was evaluated regarding the significance of the paths and variance explained. All the proposed paths were positive and statistically significant, suggesting adequate support for our hypotheses. Furthermore, the proposed model explained 53. Two percent of the variance was in behavioral intentions for tree planting, and 39.9 % of the variance was in pro-environmental behavior. In addition, the model explained 6 % of the variance in attitudes toward tree planting, 17 % of the variance in subjective norms for tree planting, and 16 % of the variance in perceived behavioral control for tree planting. This suggests that our integrated model of the value-belief-norm theory with the theory of planned behavior has adequate predictive ability. Table 6   below shows the results of structural model testing. Fig. 3   below summarizes the hypothesis testing results in a structural model. 5.4.1 Mediation analysis According to the proposed model, we also need to evaluate the potential mediating effects. Based on the established guidelines [84 ], we evaluate the four possible mediating effects in our proposed model. The first model is ATT-TP, which mediates personal values and behavioral intentions. The direct effect of personal values on BI-TP is 0.201 (p=0.005), while the indirect effect through ATT-TP is 0.0416 (p=0.0268). Therefore, as per the guidelines, this reflects complementary partial mediation [84 ]. In the second model, subjective norms seem to mediate the direct effect of environmental beliefs on BI-TP. For this, the direct effect is 0.168 (p=0.0092), and the indirect effect through subjective norms is 0.108 (p=0.002), again suggesting complementary partial mediation [84 ]. For the mediating effect of behavioral intention toward tree planting between PBC-TP and pro-environmental behavior, the direct effect is 0.298 (p=0.000), and the indirect effect is 0.0720 (p=0.0058), suggesting complementary partial mediation [84 ]. In the fourth mediation model, PBC-TP mediated the relationship between personal norms and BI-TP, with a direct effect of 0.170 (p=0.0129) and a corresponding indirect effect of 0.0656 (p=0.0101). This is again a case of complementary partial mediation [84 ]. The implication is that all four factors partially mediate the direct effect of the enablers on the corresponding outcome variables. Therefore, we suggest that ATT-TP, SN-TP, BI-TP, and PBC-TP are partial mediators of the respective enabler-outcome relationships.    6 Discussion The present investigation sheds light on the effectiveness of the Vishu Thaineetham  initiative in fostering environmental stewardship among university students (RQ1). The initiative leverages existing communal values by embedding tree planting within a significant cultural tradition, enhancing motivation and personal norms toward environmental action. Engaging in tree planting fosters practical engagement with environmental conservation, solidifying students' connection to ecological well-being. To deepen our theoretical understanding, we elaborate on how the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and the value-belief-norm (VBN) framework complement each other in our study. The TPB elucidates the cognitive factors—attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control—that shape behavioral intentions. Concurrently, VBN connects personal values, beliefs, and norms to motivations for environmental action. This dual approach is particularly pertinent for analyzing the cultural impact of the Vishu Thaineetham  initiative on Gen Z's behaviors. By integrating these frameworks, we not only bridge a gap in the literature but also provide a nuanced view of how cultural and psychological factors synergize to promote pro-environmental behaviors among youth. Our study employed the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to explore the tree-planting intentions of individuals (RQ2). This theoretical framework assumes that individuals engage in specific behaviors after carefully considering available information. Therefore, the TPB is a suitable lens for examining individuals’ intentions to engage in environmentally friendly actions when influenced by surrounding conditions (RQ3). However, the prior literature [28 ,72 ] lacked a combined framework incorporating both TPB and VBN perspectives to study individual tree-planting behavior (RQ3). To address this gap, our study developed an integrated framework combining the TPB and VBN [24 ] to explore the factors influencing actual tree-planting performance (RQ1). While Wang et al. [20 ] demonstrated that empathy with nature fosters environmental commitment and PEB, our study developed an integrated TPB-VBN framework within the higher education context, promoting environmental behavior among students participating in the initiative (RQ2). The empirical examination of the proposed framework yielded significant results. Positive and significant path coefficients were observed for values to attitude (0.242**), attitude to behavioral intentions (0.172**), and values to behavioral intentions (0.201*). While Guan et al. [68 ] found PEB and employees’ altruistic values to be important factors, our study further highlighted personal values' statistically significant and substantive effect in shaping environmental attitudes and fostering pro-environmental behaviors (RQ1). Structural model evaluation confirmed a positive relationship between personal values and attitudes toward tree planting, supporting H1 (RQ2). Additionally, attitudes toward tree planting significantly predicted behavioral intentions, confirming H2 and aligning with the attitude-behavior relationship postulated by Ajzen [12 ] (RQ2). The extant literature has underscored the ability of human values to shape attitudes toward forest conservation [85 ]. To this end, our study revealed that attitude mediated the relationship between personal values and their influence on behavioral intentions related to tree planting. The direct positive effect of personal values on behavioral intentions (H3) suggests that individuals with deeply ingrained environmental values are more likely to engage in actions such as tree planting without the mediation of attitudes, supporting the direct pathway outlined by the value-belief-norm theory (RQ2). This finding adds directly to our understanding of the different sociopsychological factors that shape tree planting intentions [60 ]. To cultivate positive attitudes toward tree planting, the initiative provides participants with detailed information on the environmental impact of their actions. Therefore, Schwartz et al. [86 ] explored how climate change and mental health are related, and our study further suggested that knowledge empowers individuals to understand the tangible impact they can have on environmental sustainability. By providing information about the positive environmental effects of tree planting, the initiative shapes positive attitudes and empowers students to recognize the significance of their contributions. This suggests that personal values are the most crucial antecedent influencing behavioral intentions for tree planting, potentially shaping attitudes when necessary (RQ2). Based on the extant literature review of Lee et al. [62 ], our study postulated that environmental beliefs might influence subjective norms and behavioral intentions for tree planting. Our findings suggest that the effect of environmental values on subjective norms for tree planting (H4) on behavioral intentions is positive and significant (0.412***). Subjective norms, influenced by perceptions of social endorsement, are strategically targeted by aligning the initiative with communal and cultural support for tree planting, thereby fostering a conducive atmosphere for pro-environmental actions [71 ]. Furthermore, the effect of subjective norms on behavioral intentions (H5) is also positive and significant (0.263***), with the direct effect of environmental beliefs on behavioral intentions (H6) also being positive and significant (0.168*). This suggests that environmental beliefs shape what one's surroundings think about tree planting [67 ]. Including Vishu Thaineetham  in this context enhances subjective norms, potentially increasing perceived behavioral control by facilitating sapling distribution, thereby making tree planting more accessible and actionable. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the respondents' peers, friends, and family encourage them to plant trees. Similarly, personal norms were found to shape (0.399***) positively perceived behavioral control (H7), which in turn positively shapes (0.164*) the behavioral intentions for tree planting (H8). Our findings show that personal norms also positively shape (0.170*) behavioral intentions for tree planting (H9). The initiative reinforces pro-environmental beliefs and personal norms by linking the festival with ecological renewal and responsibility. Although Gao et al. [87 ] reported that environmental health and values are prominent factors that motivate individuals, our study expands the understanding by highlighting the crucial role played by pro-environmental beliefs and personal norms in tree planting intentions. Finally, perceived behavioral control and behavioral intentions are positive enablers (0.298*** and 0.438***) of one's pro-environmental behavior (H10). Addressing perceived behavioral control through the distribution of saplings and guidance on planting techniques reduces barriers, enabling students to execute environmentally responsible actions effectively. While Nguyen & Drakou [88 ] underscored that perceived behavioral control is a necessary factor for sustainable agriculture, our study further showed that empowerment is crucial in reinforcing the connection between individual agency, cultural tradition, and environmental duty, thereby bolstering the values that underpin sustainable behaviors. The adaptation of Vishu Thaineetham  exemplifies a modern evolution of cultural traditions, enriching the cultural fabric while promoting sustainability (RQ1). The initiative's sustainable gift-giving practice, offering saplings instead of conventional presents, supports Sustainable Development Goal 13 (Climate Action) by shifting cultural norms toward ecological mindfulness. Furthermore, tree-planting efforts contributed to Sustainable Development Goal 15 (Life on Land) by enhancing biodiversity and ecological resilience, signifying the broader impact of the initiative on ecosystem health and sustainability (RQ1). 6.1 Implications for theory The proposed integrated framework potentially pioneers a new trajectory in environmental psychology, emphasizing the multidimensional impact of cultural traditions on environmental behavior. Our study utilized two theoretical approaches to explore behavioral intentions toward tree plantations. To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first to combine the value-belief norm and theory of planned behavior in an integrated framework to explore the influence on behavioral intentions and pro-environmental behavior. The value-belief-norm theory of Stern et al. [14 ] describes the antecedents and dimensions of pro-environmental behavior. The theory suggests that an individual's values influence personal norms and environmental beliefs, shaping one's pro-environmental behavior. On the other hand, the theory of planned behavior suggests that an individual's attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control shape one's intentions and subsequent actions [12 ]. The introduction of Vishu Thaineetham  as a case study into this integrated framework suggests that cultural and traditional practices can reinforce personal values, shape attitudes toward the environment, and normalize the behavior of tree planting within communities. This study's integration of VBN and TPB enriches the theoretical landscape by demonstrating how these models can be applied to younger generations in environmental research. This approach notably supports the achievement of SDG 13 (Climate Action) by detailing how individual and community behaviors related to tree planting can contribute to mitigating climate change effects. Additionally, by examining the role of cultural practices, this research aligns with SDG 4 (quality education) by underscoring the importance of integrating environmental education that respects cultural traditions. The findings suggest new pathways for extending these theories to broader applications, potentially influencing policy-making and educational strategies aimed at enhancing pro-environmental behaviors across diverse contexts. Furthermore, our research addresses a significant gap by underscoring the prominent role played by our cultural practices and environmental policies in shaping our young individuals’ sustainability efforts. With key principles from psychology, sociology, environmental science and cultural studies, our study suggests the significance of the Gen Zs value and belief system for tree planting practices. Vishu Thaineetham is one such case study of the role played by cultural adaptation in supporting environmental engagement for Gen Zs. The first ur study showed through Vishu Thaineetham how traditional practices rooted in the Indian value system and culture can be transformed into sustainable practices. Second, our study underscores the complex interplay between personal norms and perceived behavioral control in generating pro-environmental behaviors among Gen Zs. This also showed how societal norms interact and shape personal values to promote sustainable practices such as tree planting. Third, our study showed that societal norms and peer influence our individual value system, helping in building individual personality. Fourth, our study also revealed that pro-environmental attitudes and belief systems shape Gen Zs sustainability practices by positively influencing tree planting engagement. Fifth, our study confirmed that the pro-environmental value of Gen Zs positively shapes their pro-environmental behavior. Thus, our study shows that by combining VBN-TPB lenses, psychological factors and sociocultural attributes can be integrated to encourage the pro-environmental behavior of Gen Z. Sixth, through the integration of these motivational factors, our study also suggested the need for cleaner production to reduce environmental degradation. This would also help the 2030 agenda for sustainable development goals. Seventh, our study further implied that cultural practices combined with environmental education can motivate youth to participate in sustainability initiatives.  6.2 Implications for practice and policy Our study has several implications for practice and policy. There is an increased need to design programs that can directly influence the value system and quickly draw the attention of Gen Zs and millennials for enhanced participation in such programs. The inclusion of Vishu Thaineetham  is an actionable example of enhancing environmental consciousness. First, educational institutions should consider increasing environmental awareness and directly or indirectly influencing individuals' values through programs such as Vishu Thaineetham , which promotes environmental stewardship as a normative behavior. Educational institutions should integrate comprehensive environmental education into their curricula that not only teach about sustainability but also include practical involvement in environmental projects such as tree planting. Such education should focus on developing skills, enhancing knowledge, and fostering attitudes that support sustainable behaviors aligned with the motivations and values of Gen Z. This can foster a value system that not only shapes positive attitudes toward tree planting but also fortifies the behavioral intentions of individuals, especially among Gen Z and millennials, who may resonate with the cultural significance and collective aspect of such initiatives. By demonstrating how cultural practices embed personal norms and influence behavioral intentions, this research demonstrates the application of VBN and the TPB to culturally diverse environmental actions. Educational and environmental programs could draw from this integrated framework, incorporating cultural elements to design interventions that resonate with the values and norms of the targeted populations. Environmental programs could incorporate cultural elements that are meaningful to local communities, particularly young people. The success of the Vishu Thaineetham  initiative demonstrates the potential of culturally adapted practices to foster collective environmental engagement. Policies that support and promote cultural traditions linked to sustainability can increase participation and commitment among Gen Z. Second, there is a dire need to raise awareness regarding environmental beliefs. Vishu Thaineetham  illustrates a practical means to intensify environmental beliefs and the urgency of adopting a lifestyle that minimizes carbon footprints through its inclusive and globally recognized tree-planting activities. There is a growing need to organize programs to educate the masses regarding sustainable development goals among the general population regarding the SDGs [89 ], especially those with materialistic values. The Vishu Thaineetham  initiative, by promoting the gifting of saplings, aligns with SDG 13 (Climate Action) by emphasizing cleaner production practices. This tradition shifts the focus toward gifts that bear ecological benefits and foster a culture of environmental stewardship. Specifically, it encourages the sustainable production of indigenous trees, contributing to climate change mitigation by enhancing carbon sequestration. This approach not only aids in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but also supports the restoration and protection of terrestrial ecosystems, in line with SDG 15 (Life on Land). By focusing on the production aspect, Vishu Thaineetham  encourages practices that positively impact the environment, promoting the growth and sustainability of local flora without directly addressing consumption patterns. This initiative's global expansion to more than 40 countries demonstrates a commitment to sustainable production and environmental conservation on an international scale. Recognizing the unique characteristics of Gen Z, particularly its high engagement with digital technology and associated psychological impacts, is essential. Inviting input and feedback from Gen Z in policy-making processes not only enhances the democratic nature of environmental governance but also builds trust and accountability. Policies should facilitate open dialogs, workshops, and forums where young people can express their ideas and concerns regarding environmental initiatives. The digital nativity of Gen Z provides access to information, but it also affects people's mental health, which can influence their motivation and capacity to participate in environmental actions such as tree planting. It is important to recognize and address the mental health challenges faced by Gen Z, as these challenges can impact their capacity for environmental activism. Policies should be enacted that provide support for mental health in educational and community settings, creating a supportive environment that enables young people to engage in sustainability. Increasing transparency and public participation in the planning and implementation of environmental policies is crucial. Finally, there is a need to integrate personal values in the environmental and social context with the more practical dimensions of the concept. Awareness and careful consideration of these values can increase the effectiveness of different campaigns by allowing students to find them personally meaningful in several ways. Moreover, these may include campaigns that have students’ values at the core and explicitly target aspects such as planting, a more concise overview of environmental benefits, and a more extensive explanation of the social value associated with planting. This will involve integrating the emphasis on subjective norms, which means that creating a favorable context to develop positive attitudes toward planting is crucial. This may be achieved through student-led campaigns and socially endorsed endorsements of university celebrities and through regular campaigns that normalize planting further as a cultural and community norm. Additional resources would then emphasize the way planting accords with personal value systems, with the response integrated into the university curricula and with student engagement acknowledged and supported. Easier access to external environmental groups and university clubs would help instill this approach and form an even greater wave of social endorsement across the students. Additional student-led events, social media, and active students’ awards would drive that narrative, further strengthening the personal or social identity associated with planting. More theoretically, universities need to ensure that it is easy for students to participate in planting. This covers access to equipment and training so that it is perceived as achievable and available to students. At the same time, individual-centered intentions and commitments strengthened by pledges or other visible commitments will reliably link personal responsibility to the goal, strengthening perceived self-efficacy in the process. Education-oriented measures will deepen the sense of responsibility. College programs should consider ethics for planting more fully to make the goal more achievable and valuable. Thus, students feel that they are competent enough to engage in planting competently, and they feel that this is valuable. Therefore, the university would adequately and significantly stimulate intentions to take action. The continuation of the campaigns and other related programs would help maintain this and transform initial intentions. This would eventually strengthen the campus's culture initiative and future leaders’ innovations in the environment.   7 Conclusion The study's integration of VBN and TPB enriches the theoretical landscape by demonstrating how VBN and TPB can be applied to younger generations in environmental research. This suggests that personal values regarding the environment can influence behavioral intentions toward tree planting by appropriately shaping one's attitude. In addition, environmental beliefs can influence one's behavioral intentions toward tree planting by shaping subjective norms. Furthermore, personal norms influence one's perceived behavioral control of tree plantations and behavioral intentions. The resultant behavioral intentions for tree planting subsequently shape one's pro-environmental behavior. This suggests that the behavioral intentions of planned behavior theory can predict an individual's pro-environmental behaviors [62 ]. The celebration of Vishu Thaineetham , with its underlying value of environmental conservation, could thus catalyze changes in personal norms and enhance perceived behavioral control, resulting in increased behavioral intentions to engage in tree planting [58 ]. Therefore, our study suggests that the combined lens of planned behavior and value-belief norm theory can be used to more effectively identify how an individual's beliefs and value system shape his or her pro-environmental behavior. In essence, adaptations of Vishu Thaineetham  can catalyze environmental action and education, aligning traditional practices with modern sustainability goals. Its influence extends beyond individual behavior change, proposing a scalable model for global environmental initiatives at universities that resonate with cultural values and community participation. This study emphasizes the need for an interdisciplinary approach to enhancing pro-environmental behaviors among Gen Z, merging insights from psychology, sociology, environmental science, and cultural studies. It showcases how personal values, social norms, and cultural practices, exemplified by the Vishuthaineetham initiative, effectively promote sustainability. Highlighting the role of cultural traditions in encouraging environmental action, this research provides valuable perspectives on engaging youth in sustainability efforts. It advocates for comprehensive, culturally informed strategies in environmental policymaking and education, stressing the importance of integrating various disciplines to address the challenges of sustainable development and environmental conservation. Our study, therefore, has interdisciplinary implications. First, this study furthers the understanding of the impact of tree planting practices on ecological balance, biodiversity maintenance, and the prevention of soil erosion. Second, in the psychological realm, our study enriches our understanding of the attitudinal and motivational factors that can shape Gen Z's orientation toward increasing green cover on Earth. Third, our study also enhanced the understanding of various social norms, community influences, and engagement for Gen Z that shape their participation in environmental conservation efforts. Fourth, our study contributes to further understanding the economics of saving trees and increasing green cover through tree planting and their associated benefits in job creation. By understanding the areas where Gen Zs are more interested in participating in tree planting practices, local authorities can accordingly develop awareness programs and encourage participation. Gen Zs are well versed in technology and digital media and share their experiences with social media platforms, influence others, raise awareness, and encourage participation. Furthermore, this study paves the way for understanding the effectiveness of different education programs in terms of the environment and their influence on Gen Zs for environmental conservation efforts. Methodological expansions to include a more diverse demographic and geographic spread could involve stratified sampling or multisite case studies to ensure broader representativity and insights. Although our study contributed by developing an integrated framework for understanding the influence of an individual's behavioral orientation toward tree planting on one's pro-environmental behavior, it also has limitations. First, our study surveyed Gen Zs residing primarily in the southern Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu in a developing nation such as India. This allows for limited generalizability, and further study is required to collect responses from other parts of the country with different tastes and preferences. Second, our study did not include Millennials or individuals older than 23 years, 23-30 years, 30-40 years, or others. Further study, including that of these age groups, is required to understand how the development of pro-environmental behavior varies across different age groups. Third, research must also explore the contingent effects of age and gender on the proposed path. With a decent sample size of 203 Gen Z respondents, our study included a limited sample across each age and gender group to explore the corresponding contingent effects. Finally, a longitudinal study in a specific geographic region may also help discover other interesting characteristics of one's behavioral intentions for tree planting. Furthermore, other factors, such as environmental disaffection, intrinsic motivations, and environmental participation, also require empirical testing within this integrated TPB-VBN framework to understand their interplay in shaping university students’ tree planting intentions. Finally, our study could not assess endogeneity due to a lack of marker variables at the beginning of the study [90 ]. Future studies assessing this integrated framework, therefore, should choose marker variables and assess any potential threat of endogeneity.
