Such conflict has affected China. Along with rapid economic growth, Chinese alcohol consumption (in individuals aged 15 years and older) increased dramatically from 2·5 L per capita in 1978 to 6·7 L in 2010, and an estimated consumption of 8·8 L in 2012.2,3   After a small decline in consumption in 2013 due to the government's anti-extravagance campaign, China's alcohol imports increased in value by 30% between 2014 and 2015,4   and the Australian Government predicts a rapid growth in Australian wine sales in China following the China–Australia Free Trade Agreement, which came into effect on Dec 20, 2015.5   The Chinese Government regards free trade agreements as a new platform to increase national sustainable development, and an effective approach for integration into the global economy and to strengthen economic cooperation with other countries. The potential for adverse public health effects from some commodities covered by the agreements does not seem to be noted or taken into account. Although alcohol has been recognised as an important health risk factor in China, the social and health issues associated with alcohol use and abuse, particularly with respect to non-communicable diseases and injuries, have been largely neglected. The 2013 Global Burden of Disease Study showed that alcohol use was ranked as the greatest risk factor for men in China aged 15–49 years in terms of attributable disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost, contributing to more than 120 000 deaths and over 8 million DALYs among young and middle-aged men each year.6   Furthermore, there is almost no alcohol control policy in China, unlike in other countries.7   The government now urgently needs to establish a public health-oriented commission or agency charged specifically with developing controls over the alcohol market and implementing a strategy to reduce levels of alcohol consumption and associated problems in China. Along with more attention to public health policy on reducing alcohol-associated social and health problems, the policy space for reducing harmful use of alcohol needs to be protected from threats posed by new trade and investment agreements. We declare no competing interests.
