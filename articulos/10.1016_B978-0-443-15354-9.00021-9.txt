Keywords Sustainable development goals  water pollution  waterborne diseases  climate changes  water-energy nexus  food security  green economy   1.1 Introduction  Water is essential for sustainable development, as it is necessary for human health, food security, and economic development. The importance of water in sustainable development is rooted in the fact that water is a finite and vulnerable resource, and the demand for water is increasing  due to population growth, urbanization, and industrialization.1   The availability and quality of water resources are also threatened by climate change, pollution, and unsustainable use.2   Access to safe water and sanitation is critical to prevent waterborne diseases and malnutrition, which are major health challenges in many parts of the world.3,4   Lack of access to water and sanitation also contributes to poverty, as people, especially women and girls in the countryside, spend a significant amount of time and energy collecting water instead of engaging in productive activities. In addition, water scarcity can lead to food insecurity, as agriculture accounts for most of the water used worldwide. Water is also critical for economic development, as it supports many industries, such as energy production, manufacturing, and tourism.5,6   Sustainable management of water resources is essential to ensure their availability for future generations.7   This involves balancing the competing demands of various sectors, such as agriculture, industry, and domestic use, while maintaining the health of ecosystems (see Fig. 1.1  ). Climate change exacerbates water scarcity and variability, making it more challenging to sustain water resources. Therefore, adopting sustainable practices such as water conservation, integrated water resources management, and ecosystem-based approaches is necessary to achieve several of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including those related to poverty reduction, food security, health, and environmental sustainability.9   Promoting the sustainable use of water resources is essential, which includes improving access to safe water and sanitation, reducing water pollution, increasing water use efficiency, and protecting aquatic ecosystems.10,11   In addition, addressing water challenges requires collaboration among different stakeholders, including governments, civil society, the private sector, and communities, to ensure that everyone has access to safe and sustainable water and sanitation services. In summary, the  importance of water in sustainable development cannot be overstated, and sustainable water management practices are necessary to ensure a prosperous and healthy future for all. Key points that have to be taken care of are• Water is essential for human health, food security, and economic development.  • Lack of access to safe water and sanitation can lead to waterborne diseases, malnutrition, and poverty.  • Sustainable use of water resources is important to ensure their availability for future generations.  • Water is also critical for ecosystems and biodiversity, as it provides habitats for aquatic animals and supports various ecosystem services such as water purification and flood control.  • Sustainable management of water resources is necessary to achieve several of the SDGs, including those related to poverty reduction, food security, health, and environmental sustainability.     1.2 Scientometrics analysis of the influence of water on important features 1.2.1 Research articles on a diverse range of topics related to water Water is a vital resource for human society and the natural environment, and water-related research has been the subject of increasing attention from the scientific community and policymakers in recent years.12   A bibliometric analysis of water-related research published in the Scopus database during the period of 2018–22 was conducted to explore the research trends, patterns, and gaps in this field. The study identified a total of 1,182,569 articles related to water, with an average of 236,513 publications per year. The results of the bibliometric analysis revealed that water-related research has been growing steadily over the past 5 years, with a significant increase in the number of publications since 2018, as shown in Fig. 1.2  . The study identified a diverse range of topics related to water research, including water management, water pollution, water quality, hydrology, water resources, and water sustainability. The analysis also revealed that China, the United States, and India were the leading contributors to water-related research, with the highest number of publications. Moreover, the study identified emerging areas of research interest in water-related research, such as the impact of climate change on water resources, the nexus between water and energy, water-agriculture-food security, and water quality and pollution sources.   1.2.2 Insights into the emerging water-related research areas The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the current state of water-related research and can inform future research and policy decisions to address the challenges and opportunities in this critical field. Bibliometric studies provide insights into the key research themes and research trends. In this bibliometric study, the data sources used for the analysis were Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus. Water and climate change are closely linked, as climate change can affect the water cycle and water availability in various regions. Climate change impacts on water resources include changes in precipitation patterns, melting of glaciers, and increased frequency of extreme weather events such as floods and droughts. There have been many significant studies on the impact of climate change on water availability, water demand, and water management strategies. Bibliometric studies depicting the number of publications in the past 5 years on the studies linked between water and climate change are shown in Fig. 1.3A  . The exponential trends indicate that the research studies on the impact of climate change on water resources are increasing. The water-energy nexus is another important area of research that focuses on the interdependency between water and energy systems. Water is used in various stages of energy production and consumption, and energy is required for water treatment and distribution. Research in this area has focused on understanding the complex relationships between water and energy systems and developing strategies to  promote sustainable management. Bibliometric studies depicting the number of publications in the past 5 years on the studies linked between water and climate change are shown in Fig. 1.3B . The trends indicate that the number of research studies is increasing every year. Water, agriculture, and food security are important interconnected concepts that have received significant attention in academic literature. Food security and agriculture are dependent on water availability and quality, and this relationship has been studied extensively in different parts of the world. Researchers have examined various aspects of this relationship, such as the impact of climate change on water resources and crop yields, the role of irrigation in improving water use efficiency, and the implications of groundwater depletion on food production. Bibliometric studies depicting the number of publications in the past 5 years on the studies linked between water and climate change are shown in Fig. 1.3C . The trends indicate that the number of research studies is increasing every year. Water quality and pollution sources have been a significant concern for environmentalists, policymakers, and public health professionals for decades. A bibliometric analysis of research articles on water quality and pollution sources published between 2018 and 2022 in the WOS and Scopus databases revealed that these topics have been the subject of increasing (see Fig. 1.3D ) research attention over the past 5 years.   1.2.3 Insights into the water-related research areas networks Bibliographic network graphs are a powerful tool for visualizing the relationships between different research areas in the field of water resources management. By analyzing the cocitation patterns of scholarly articles, bibliographic network graphs can reveal the most influential papers, authors, and research areas in a given field. One important area in the water-related research area is climate change. Bibliographic network graphs of climate change research in the water sector can identify key papers and authors that have contributed to our understanding of the impacts of climate change on water resources. These graphs (see Fig. 1.4  ) can also show how different research areas within climate change, such as hydrology, water resources management, and environmental science, are interconnected. Another important research area is the water-energy nexus. Bibliographic network graphs on this topic can help understand the complex interrelationships between water and energy, besides identifying key publications and authors. These plots can also showcase the interdependency and interconnectivity of various research areas, such as water policy, energy policy, and environmental science, and their influence on each other. Likewise, water pollution is a critical area of research in water-related research areas. Bibliographic network graphs of water pollution research can identify key papers and authors that have contributed to  our understanding of the sources and impacts of water pollution. These graphs can also show how different research areas, such as wastewater treatment, water quality monitoring, and environmental toxicology, are interconnected and influence each other. Thus, these bibliographic network graphs are valuable tools for identifying the most important research areas, papers, and authors in water-related research areas and for visualizing the connections between different areas of research.  1.2.4 Insights into funding agencies on the research on water-related areas Further, to understand and identify the prominent funding agencies, a bibliometric analysis was conducted on the research funding of published articles between 2018 and 2022 in the WOS and Scopus databases in four research areas: water and climate change, water and energy nexus, water and agriculture and food security, and water treatment and pollution sources. In the water and climate change  research area, a bibliometric analysis (see Fig. 1.5  ) revealed that the top funding agencies were the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), followed by the National Science Foundation (NSF), European Commission, and the United Kingdom Research Innovation (UKRI). The most productive countries in terms of publications were the United States, China, Germany, and  England. The top research topics included the impacts of climate change on water resources, water scarcity, and adaptation strategies. Similarly, in the water and energy nexus  research area, the top funding agencies were the NSF, followed by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), followed by NSF National Key Research and Development Program of China, European Commission and the United Kingdom Research Innovation (UKRI). The United States, China, and England were the most productive countries in terms of publications. The top research topics included the water-energy-food nexus, renewable energy and water desalination, and energy efficiency in water treatment. Likewise, the top funding agencies in the research areas “water and agriculture and food security ” and “water treatment and pollution sources ” research areas are given in Fig. 1.5 . The top research topics included water use efficiency in agriculture, water scarcity and irrigation, and water quality and food safety. Whereas the top research topics, “water treatment and pollution sources,” research areas are water treatment technologies, wastewater treatment and reuse, and the impacts of emerging pollutants on water quality. This bibliometric analysis reveals important patterns in funding agencies, productive countries, and research topics. This information can be useful for researchers, funding agencies, and policymakers in identifying research gaps and priorities in these areas.   1.3 Linkage of water and various sustainable development goals The SDGs include a specific goal on water and sanitation (SDG 6), which highlights the importance of ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water resources for all. This goal recognizes that access to safe water and sanitation is critical to achieving many other SDGs, such as those related to health, food security, gender equality, and economic development. SDG 6 calls for universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water and sanitation, as well as for improving water quality, increasing water use efficiency, and protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems. In addition to SDG 6, several other SDGs are relevant to water, including those related to poverty reduction, health, food security, energy, climate change, oceans, and ecosystems.5,13   For example, SDG 2 on ending hunger and promoting sustainable agriculture requires sustainable water management practices to ensure adequate and reliable water supplies for crops and livestock.14   SDG 3 on ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all includes the need for safe water and sanitation to prevent waterborne diseases. SDG 13, on taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts, recognizes the importance of adapting to changes in water availability and quality caused by  climate change. Therefore, achieving the SDGs related to water requires a comprehensive and integrated approach that addresses the interlinkages among different SDGs and sectors and considers the needs and priorities of different stakeholders, especially the most vulnerable and marginalized populations.7   Various sustainable development goals are directly or indirectly linked with water, as shown in Fig. 1.6   are:• SDG 6 : Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.  • SDG 2 : End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture, which requires sustainable water management practices.  • SDG 3 : Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all, which includes access to safe water and sanitation to prevent waterborne diseases.  • SDG 7 : Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all, which includes the promotion of renewable energy sources that reduce water use.  • SDG 13 : Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts, which includes the need to adapt to changes in water availability and quality caused by climate change.  • SDG 14 : Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development, which includes the need to manage freshwater inputs into coastal ecosystems.  • SDG 15 : Protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and biodiversity loss, which includes the need to manage water resources to support healthy ecosystems.      1.4 Water quality and its importance to human health and the environment Water quality refers to the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of water that determine its suitability for specific uses, such as drinking, irrigation, and aquatic life. The quality of water can be affected by natural and human-induced factors, such as climate, land use, pollution, and industrial activities. Poor water quality can have significant impacts on human health and the environment.3   Contaminated water can cause waterborne diseases, such as cholera, typhoid fever, and diarrhea, which are major health challenges in many parts of the world, especially in developing countries. These diseases can lead to illness, death, and economic losses due to medical expenses, lost productivity, and increased healthcare costs. Water quality is a complex issue that requires ongoing monitoring and management to ensure its safety and suitability for various uses. The World Health Organization sets guidelines for drinking water quality and recommends regular testing and treatment to ensure its safety. Treatment processes such as disinfection, filtration, and chemical treatment can remove contaminants and improve the quality of drinking water. Similarly, wastewater treatment is essential to prevent pollution of water bodies and ensure the safe discharge of treated effluent. Sustainable management of water resources, including measures such as watershed management, integrated water resources management, and pollution prevention, can also help improve water quality by reducing pollution sources and protecting ecosystems.10   The importance of water quality is further underscored by the impacts of climate change on water resources. Changes in precipitation patterns and increased temperatures can affect water availability and quality, leading to more frequent droughts, floods, and water scarcity. This can exacerbate water quality problems, as reduced water flows can concentrate pollutants, and increased runoff can carry contaminants into water bodies. Therefore, addressing water quality challenges requires integrated approaches that consider the complex interactions between water resources, ecosystems, and human activities and that are resilient to the impacts of climate change. This requires collaboration among different stakeholders, including governments, civil society, the private sector, and communities, to ensure that water resources are managed sustainably and that everyone has access to safe and sustainable water and sanitation services. Water quality is also critical for the health of ecosystems and biodiversity. Contaminants in water can harm aquatic life, alter ecosystem functions, and reduce the availability of ecosystem services, such as water purification and nutrient cycling. This can have cascading effects  on other species and ecosystems and ultimately affect human well-being, as many ecosystem services are essential for food production, water supply, and climate regulation. Therefore, protecting and improving water quality is essential for achieving several of the SDGs, including those related to health, ecosystems, and sustainable water management. This requires adopting sustainable practices that prevent or reduce pollution, promote ecosystem health, and ensure the safe and sustainable use of water resources for current and future generations. Fig. 1.7   shows the interlinkages between the water bodies (lakes and reservoirs) and actions in the framework of the SDGs that are necessary to implement for achieving a better and more sustainable environment. 1.4.1 Factors affecting water quality (e.g., pollution and climate change) Several factors can affect water quality, including natural and human-induced factors, as shown in Fig. 1.8  . One of the most significant human-induced factors affecting water quality is pollution. Pollution can come from various sources, such as industrial and agricultural activities, sewage and wastewater discharge, and urban runoff. Pollutants can include nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, which can cause harmful algal blooms and eutrophication; toxic  chemicals such as pesticides and heavy metals, which can harm aquatic life and human health and pathogens such as bacteria and viruses, which can cause waterborne diseases. Climate change is another significant factor affecting water quality. Changes in precipitation patterns, temperature, and extreme weather events can affect water availability and quality, leading to more frequent droughts, floods, and water scarcity.2   This can exacerbate water quality problems, as reduced water flows can concentrate pollutants, and increased runoff can carry contaminants into water bodies. Climate change can also affect the distribution and abundance of aquatic species, alter water temperature and chemistry, and increase the risk of harmful algal blooms and other water quality problems.17   Other factors that can affect water quality include land use changes, such as deforestation and urbanization, which can increase erosion and runoff and alter water chemistry and temperature, and invasive species, which can outcompete native species and alter ecosystem functions. Human activities that cause soil erosion, such as agriculture and construction, can also affect water quality by increasing sedimentation and nutrient loading in water bodies. Therefore, addressing water quality challenges requires an integrated approach that considers the complex interactions between water resources, ecosystems, and human activities and that is resilient to the impacts of pollution, climate change, and other stressors.   1.4.2 Strategies for improving water quality (e.g., regulation and monitoring) Improving water quality requires a combination of strategies that address pollution sources, protect ecosystems, and promote sustainable water management practices. One key strategy is regulation, which involves setting standards for water quality and enforcing them through monitoring and enforcement activities. This can include regulations on discharges of pollutants from point sources, such as wastewater treatment plants and industrial facilities, as well as regulations on nonpoint sources of pollution, such as agricultural runoff and urban stormwater. Regulatory approaches can also include water use restrictions and incentives for adopting sustainable practices, such as pollution prevention and water conservation. Another key strategy for improving water quality is monitoring, which involves regular testing of water quality parameters to assess compliance with standards and identify emerging issues. Monitoring can also help identify pollution sources and inform management strategies to address them. Monitoring can be conducted at various scales, from local to regional and global, and can involve various methods, such as remote sensing, water sampling, and biological monitoring. Protecting and restoring ecosystems is another important strategy for improving water quality. Healthy ecosystems can provide natural water purification services, regulate water flows, and support biodiversity and recreational opportunities. This can be achieved through measures such as watershed management, wetland restoration, and sustainable land use practices, such as conservation agriculture and smart urban design. Protecting ecosystems can also involve engaging local communities and stakeholders in conservation and management activities, such as water quality monitoring, citizen science, and stewardship programs. Overall, improving water quality requires a comprehensive and integrated approach that considers the complex interactions between water resources, ecosystems, and human activities and that is resilient to the impacts of pollution, climate change, and other stressors. This requires collaboration among different stakeholders, including governments, civil society, the private sector, and communities, to ensure that water resources are managed sustainably and that everyone has access to safe and sustainable water and sanitation services.   1.5 Waterborne diseases Waterborne diseases are illnesses caused by microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, that are transmitted through contaminated  water. These microorganisms can enter water sources from various sources, such as untreated sewage, agricultural runoff, and animal waste.18,19   They can survive in water for extended periods, especially in warm and stagnant water. When people consume contaminated water, they can become infected with the microorganisms, which can cause symptoms ranging from mild gastroenteritis to severe and life-threatening diseases. Some of the most common waterborne diseases include cholera, typhoid fever, and dysentery, as seen in Fig. 1.9  . Cholera is a bacterial infection caused by Vibrio cholerae , which can cause severe diarrhea and dehydration and can lead to death if left untreated. Cholera is endemic in many parts of the world with poor sanitation and hygiene, and outbreaks can occur in areas with contaminated water sources, especially after natural disasters or conflicts.11    Typhoid fever is another bacterial infection caused by Salmonella typhi , which can cause fever, headache, and abdominal pain. Typhoid fever is also associated with poor sanitation and hygiene and can be transmitted through contaminated food and water, especially in areas with inadequate water treatment and sanitation facilities. Dysentery is a type of bacterial or protozoal infection that can cause severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever. It is usually caused by consuming contaminated water or food, especially in areas with poor sanitation and hygiene. Other waterborne diseases include hepatitis A, cryptosporidiosis, and giardiasis, which can cause similar symptoms and can be transmitted through contaminated water sources. Preventing waterborne diseases requires a combination of measures, including improving water treatment and sanitation facilities, promoting good hygiene practices, and raising awareness about the risks of consuming contaminated water. It also requires addressing underlying social, economic, and environmental factors, such as poverty, inequality, and inadequate water and sanitation infrastructure, that contribute to the spread of waterborne diseases. 1.5.1 Causes of waterborne diseases (e.g., poor sanitation and contaminated water sources) Waterborne diseases are caused by microorganisms that can enter water sources from various sources, including untreated sewage, animal waste, and agricultural runoff.18,19   These microorganisms can survive in water for extended periods, especially in warm and stagnant water, and can infect people who consume contaminated water. The causes of waterborne diseases can be categorized into three main groups: poor sanitation, contaminated water sources, and inadequate water treatment.11   Poor sanitation is one of the primary causes of waterborne diseases. This refers to the lack of proper disposal of human and animal waste, which can contaminate water sources and spread waterborne diseases. In many parts of the world, access to proper sanitation facilities, such as toilets and wastewater treatment plants, is limited, which leads to open defecation and the contamination of water sources with fecal matter. This can contribute to the spread of waterborne diseases such as cholera, typhoid fever, and dysentery. Contaminated water sources are another significant cause of waterborne diseases. This can include both natural sources, such as rivers and lakes, and man-made sources, such as wells and piped water systems. Sources of contamination can include agricultural runoff, industrial effluents, and untreated sewage, which can contain a range of microorganisms and chemicals that can cause waterborne diseases. In  some cases, water sources can become contaminated during extreme weather events, such as floods or droughts, which can disrupt water treatment and sanitation facilities. Inadequate water treatment is another cause of waterborne diseases. Even when water sources are not initially contaminated, inadequate treatment can lead to the survival of microorganisms that can cause waterborne diseases. Water treatment processes, such as chlorination, filtration, and disinfection, are essential for removing contaminants and reducing the risk of waterborne diseases. However, in many parts of the world, water treatment facilities are inadequate or not functioning, leading to the spread of waterborne diseases.  1.5.2 Strategies for preventing waterborne diseases (e.g., improved sanitation and access to clean water) Preventing waterborne diseases requires a combination of strategies, including improving sanitation, promoting access to clean water, and implementing effective water treatment and monitoring systems. Improved sanitation is one of the most effective strategies for preventing waterborne diseases.20   This includes providing access to safe and hygienic toilets, as well as establishing proper wastewater treatment and disposal systems. In addition, promoting good hygiene practices, such as handwashing with soap, can also help to reduce the spread of waterborne diseases. Access to clean water is also critical for preventing waterborne diseases. This can include improving the quality of water sources through water treatment and monitoring, as well as providing access to safe drinking water through piped water systems, wells, and other sources. In some cases, water purification technologies, such as ultraviolet (UV) disinfection and reverse osmosis, can be used to treat water sources and remove contaminants. Effective water treatment and monitoring systems are also essential for preventing waterborne diseases. Water treatment facilities, such as chlorination and filtration systems, can remove microorganisms and chemicals from water sources, while regular water quality monitoring can help to identify and respond to contamination events. In addition, community-based surveillance systems can help to identify outbreaks of waterborne diseases and prevent further spread. Addressing underlying social, economic, and environmental factors that contribute to the spread of waterborne diseases is also critical for preventing future outbreaks. This can include addressing poverty, inequality, and inadequate water and sanitation infrastructure, as well as promoting sustainable water management practices that protect water sources and reduce the risk of contamination.    1.6 Sanitation and its importance to human health and the environment Sanitation refers to the safe management and disposal of human waste, including urine and feces, as well as other forms of wastewater generated by households, industries, and agriculture.21   It also includes the provision of hygiene facilities, such as toilets and handwashing stations, and the promotion of good hygiene practices to prevent the spread of diseases. Sanitation is essential for protecting human health and the environment, particularly in areas where water sources are scarce or contaminated.3   The benefits of improved drinking water supply and sanitation are given in Table 1.1  .  Poor sanitation can lead to the spread of diseases, particularly waterborne diseases, which are responsible for millions of deaths each year, mostly in developing countries. Contaminated water sources, which can result from poor sanitation practices, can transmit a range of diseases, including cholera, typhoid fever, and diarrhea.23   These diseases can have serious health consequences, particularly for children and the elderly, and can also result in economic losses due to reduced productivity and increased healthcare costs. In addition to its impact on human health, poor sanitation can also have significant environmental consequences. Untreated human waste and wastewater can contaminate water sources, leading to the eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems and the spread of waterborne diseases.18   This can have a negative impact on biodiversity and ecosystem services, as well as on industries such as fishing and tourism that depend on healthy aquatic ecosystems. Improving sanitation is, therefore, critical for achieving SDGs related to health, water, and biodiversity. 1.6.1 Challenges to achieving universal sanitation access (e.g., lack of infrastructure and funding) Despite progress made in recent years, achieving universal access to sanitation remains a major challenge, particularly in low-income countries. A range of factors contributes to this challenge, including lack of infrastructure, inadequate funding, and social and cultural barriers. One of the main challenges to achieving universal sanitation access is the lack of infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. Many communities lack access to safe and hygienic toilets, and wastewater treatment and disposal systems are often inadequate or nonexistent. This is particularly true in low-income countries, where access to basic sanitation infrastructure is often limited by poverty, geographic isolation, and other factors.24   Inadequate funding is another major challenge to achieving universal sanitation access. Despite the high cost-effectiveness of sanitation interventions, funding for sanitation has historically been limited, particularly in low-income countries. This has resulted in a significant funding gap for sanitation infrastructure and services, which has slowed progress toward universal access. Social and cultural barriers also contribute to the challenge of achieving universal sanitation access. These can include traditional beliefs and practices related to sanitation, as well as social norms that prioritize other needs, such as food and education, over sanitation. In addition, a lack of awareness and education about the importance of sanitation can  hinder progress toward universal access. Addressing these social and cultural barriers is therefore critical for achieving sustainable and equitable sanitation access for all.  1.6.2 Strategies for improving sanitation Improving sanitation requires a range of strategies, including policy reforms, education campaigns, and infrastructure development.• Policy reforms are critical for improving sanitation, as they can create the necessary enabling environment for sanitation services and infrastructure to be developed and maintained. This can include legislative and regulatory frameworks that promote sustainable sanitation practices, as well as policies that prioritize sanitation investment and funding.  • Education campaigns are also essential for improving sanitation, particularly in areas where social and cultural barriers to sanitation exist. These campaigns can raise awareness about the importance of sanitation for health and the environment, as well as promote good hygiene practices such as handwashing and safe food handling. Education campaigns can also help to address traditional beliefs and practices related to sanitation and can promote the adoption of innovative sanitation technologies and practices.  • Infrastructure development is also critical for improving sanitation. This can include the construction of toilets and other sanitation facilities, as well as the development of wastewater treatment and disposal systems. Infrastructure development should be guided by principles of sustainability, ensuring that sanitation facilities and services are accessible, affordable, and appropriate for the local context.24   In addition, infrastructure development should prioritize the needs of vulnerable populations, such as women, children, and people with disabilities, and should be implemented in a participatory manner, involving local communities in decision-making processes.      1.7 Water conservation and its importance for sustainable development Water conservation is the practice of using water efficiently and reducing water waste. It involves the careful management and use of water resources to ensure their availability for future generations.25   Water conservation aims to reduce the amount of water used without compromising essential needs such as drinking, sanitation, and food production. It is essential for sustainable development because water is  a finite resource that is essential for all aspects of life. The growing global population and increasing demand for water in various sectors, such as agriculture, industry, and domestic use, have led to water scarcity and depletion of water resources. This has negative consequences on the environment, human health, and economic growth. Conserving water can help to reduce water scarcity and protect water resources. It can also contribute to sustainable development by promoting the efficient use of water in various sectors, reducing energy use and carbon emissions, and improving the economic efficiency of water use.13   Water conservation can also support the achievement of SDGs such as clean water and sanitation, food security, and sustainable production and consumption patterns. It is essential to adopt water conservation practices in all aspects of life to ensure the availability and sustainability of this precious resource for future generations. A quantitative assessment of water security should be carried out, taking into account physical, socioeconomic, and governance dimensions through the assessment of indicators covering four main criteria: availability, accessibility, safety and quality, and management. Various water security indicators are used to assess the current status of global water security. Table 1.2   presents various water security indicators along with data sources. 1.7.1 Prominent water conservation practices (e.g., efficient irrigation and low-flow fixtures) Water conservation practices involve a range of activities and technologies that aim to reduce water consumption and prevent water waste. Some examples of water conservation practices include efficient irrigation, low-flow fixtures, and water reuse. Efficient irrigation is one of the most effective water conservation practices in agriculture. This involves the use of irrigation technologies that minimize water loss through evaporation, runoff, or deep percolation. Techniques such as drip irrigation, micro-sprinklers, and soil moisture sensors can help to deliver water directly to the plant roots, reducing water waste and improving crop yields. Low-flow fixtures are another water conservation practice that is widely used in households and commercial buildings. These fixtures include showerheads, faucets, and toilets that are designed to use less water without compromising their function. Low-flow fixtures can help to reduce water consumption by up to 50% and save energy by reducing the need for heating water. Water reuse is another important water conservation practice that involves treating and reusing wastewater for nonpotable purposes such as   irrigation, industrial processes, or toilet flushing. This can help to reduce the demand for freshwater and prevent the discharge of untreated wastewater into the environment. Water reuse technologies such as membrane filtration, reverse osmosis, and UV disinfection can help to produce high-quality treated wastewater that is safe for various reuse applications.  1.7.2 Strategies for promoting water conservation (e.g., education campaigns and pricing mechanisms) Promoting water conservation requires a combination of strategies that incentivize individuals, businesses, and governments to adopt sustainable water management practices. Some of the strategies for promoting water conservation include education campaigns, pricing mechanisms, regulations, and technology innovations. Education campaigns are an essential strategy for promoting water conservation. Governments, organizations, and businesses can educate the public on the importance of water conservation, the impact of water use on the environment, and the benefits of adopting sustainable water management practices. Education campaigns can also provide practical tips on water-saving techniques and technologies, such as efficient irrigation, low-flow fixtures, and water reuse. Pricing mechanisms are another effective strategy for promoting water conservation. Governments can implement water pricing policies that reflect the true cost of water, including its extraction, treatment, and distribution. This can encourage individuals and businesses to use water more efficiently and reduce water waste. Pricing mechanisms can also provide incentives for investments in water-efficient technologies and innovations, such as rainwater harvesting, graywater reuse, and water-efficient appliances. Regulations are another important strategy for promoting water conservation. Governments can implement regulations and standards that mandate individuals, businesses, and industries to adopt sustainable water management practices. This can include regulations on water use in agriculture, industry, and domestic use, water quality standards, and water efficiency standards for appliances and fixtures. Finally, technological innovations can play a crucial role in promoting water conservation. Innovations such as water-efficient irrigation technologies, low-flow fixtures, and water reuse technologies can help to reduce water consumption and prevent water waste. Governments can invest in research and development of new water-efficient technologies, support technology transfer to developing countries, and provide incentives for private sector investment in water-saving technologies.    1.8 Wastewater management and its importance for sustainable development Wastewater is any water that has been used in domestic, commercial, or industrial activities and contains impurities, pollutants, or contaminants.35   Wastewater includes sewage, graywater, and industrial effluents. Proper wastewater management is essential for sustainable development because it protects public health, preserves the environment, and supports economic growth.9   The importance of proper wastewater management lies in its impact on human health. Wastewater contains pathogens, bacteria, viruses, and other harmful substances that can cause waterborne diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and diarrhea. Improper wastewater disposal can lead to the contamination of water sources and the spread of waterborne diseases. Proper wastewater treatment and disposal can prevent the spread of diseases and protect public health.36   Proper wastewater management is also essential for protecting the environment. Wastewater contains nutrients, organic matter, and pollutants that can cause water pollution, eutrophication, and ecological imbalances.37,38   Wastewater discharges into rivers, lakes, and oceans can harm aquatic life, degrade water quality, and reduce biodiversity.39,40   Proper wastewater treatment and disposal can prevent environmental damage and promote sustainable use of water resources.41,42   Wastewater can also be a valuable resource for agriculture, industry, and energy production. Proper treatment and reuse of wastewater can contribute to sustainable development by reducing the demand for freshwater, conserving natural resources, and promoting circular economy practices. 1.8.1 Challenges to proper wastewater management (e.g., lack of infrastructure and funding) Despite the importance of proper wastewater management, there are several challenges that prevent its implementation and hinder sustainable development. Some of the challenges to proper wastewater management include lack of infrastructure, inadequate funding, lack of technical expertise, and weak regulatory frameworks. One of the significant challenges to proper wastewater management is the lack of infrastructure. In many parts of the world, especially in developing countries, there is inadequate infrastructure for wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal. The absence of sewer systems, treatment plants, and proper disposal facilities leads to uncontrolled discharge of untreated wastewater into the environment, polluting water sources and harming public health.  Inadequate funding is another challenge to proper wastewater management. Building and maintaining wastewater infrastructure, including treatment plants and collection networks, requires significant financial investments. Many countries, especially in developing regions, face budget constraints and competing priorities, leading to insufficient funds for wastewater management. As a result, many wastewater treatment facilities are underfunded, understaffed, and poorly maintained, resulting in poor performance and inadequate treatment capacity. Lack of technical expertise is also a challenge to proper wastewater management. Wastewater treatment and disposal require specialized skills and knowledge that are often lacking in many regions. The absence of trained personnel and technical experts in wastewater treatment can lead to substandard treatment performance and low-quality effluent. Weak regulatory frameworks that do not enforce standards and regulations also hinder proper wastewater management, allowing industries and individuals to dispose of wastewater improperly and pollute water sources.  1.8.2 Strategies for improving wastewater management (e.g., wastewater treatment and reuse) Improving wastewater management requires a range of strategies that promote sustainable use of water resources, protect public health, and support economic growth. Some of the strategies for improving wastewater management include wastewater treatment, reuse, recycling, and resource recovery. Wastewater treatment is an essential strategy for improving wastewater management. Wastewater treatment involves removing pollutants and contaminants from wastewater, making it safe for disposal or reuse. Wastewater treatment plants use physical, chemical, and biological processes to remove solids, organic matter, nutrients, and pathogens from wastewater, producing treated effluent that meets quality standards. Treated wastewater can be discharged into rivers, lakes, or oceans or used for irrigation, industrial processes, or energy production. Wastewater reuse is another effective strategy for improving wastewater management. Wastewater reuse involves using treated wastewater for beneficial purposes such as irrigation, industrial processes, or toilet flushing. Wastewater reuse reduces the demand for freshwater and supports the sustainable use of water resources. In some regions, such as water-scarce regions or regions with limited access to freshwater, wastewater reuse is an essential source of water supply. Recycling and resource recovery from wastewater is another innovative strategy for improving wastewater management. Recycling and resource recovery involve recovering valuable resources from wastewater, such as  nutrients, energy, and biosolids. Nutrient recovery involves extracting nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater and using them as fertilizers. Energy recovery involves capturing biogas produced during wastewater treatment and using it for energy production. Biosolids are the residual sludge generated during wastewater treatment and can be used as fertilizers, soil conditioners, or energy sources. Recycling and resource recovery from wastewater promote circular economy practices, reduce environmental impacts, and support sustainable development.   1.9 Green economy and its importance to the sustainable development A green economy is an economic system that prioritizes sustainability and environmental protection while also promoting social and economic well-being. The green economy is characterized by a shift away from resource-intensive, polluting industries towards cleaner, more efficient technologies and practices. This can include the adoption of renewable energy sources, the implementation of circular economy models, and the development of green infrastructure and services.5,13   The green economy is important for sustainable development, as it offers a pathway towards achieving environmental, social, and economic goals simultaneously. By promoting sustainability and environmental protection, the green economy can help to mitigate the negative impacts of economic activity on the environment, such as air and water pollution, deforestation, and climate change. At the same time, the green economy can also promote social and economic well-being by creating new job opportunities, improving public health, and reducing poverty and inequality. Furthermore, the green economy can help to build resilience to environmental and economic shocks, such as natural disasters, resource scarcity, and economic downturns. By promoting resource efficiency, the green economy can help to reduce reliance on finite resources and minimize waste and pollution. This can help to create a more sustainable and equitable economic system that is better equipped to address the challenges of the 21st century. 1.9.1 Green economy sectors (e.g., renewable energy and sustainable agriculture) The green economy is a growing sector that encompasses a range of activities, products, and services that contribute to sustainable development while also minimizing negative impacts on the environment.  One key area of the green economy is renewable energy, which includes technologies like solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power. These sources of energy are considered “green” because they produce very little pollution, unlike traditional fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas, which emit large amounts of greenhouse gases and other harmful pollutants. Renewable energy is becoming increasingly important as we try to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and transition towards a more sustainable future. Another area of the green economy is sustainable agriculture, which is focused on producing food and other agricultural products in a way that is environmentally and socially responsible.43,44   This includes practices like organic farming, crop rotation, and conservation tillage, which help to reduce soil erosion, conserve water, and minimize the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. Sustainable agriculture also supports local economies and communities by promoting small-scale farming and providing access to healthy, locally grown food. In addition to these sectors, the green economy encompasses many other areas, such as green building, eco-tourism, and waste management, all of which are focused on creating a more sustainable future while also supporting economic growth and job creation. The concept of a green economy is centered on the idea of creating sustainable growth and development while minimizing negative environmental impacts. Green economy sectors refer to industries and economic activities that are designed to be environmentally friendly and promote sustainability.45   The green economy is a diverse and growing sector that encompasses a range of industries and activities. Some examples of green economy sectors are renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, green building, and eco-tourism.46,47   Renewable energy is one of the fastest-growing green economy sectors, and it includes energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass.5   These sources of energy are considered sustainable because they do not emit harmful greenhouse gases or pollutants into the environment, unlike traditional fossil fuels. The renewable energy sector has enormous potential for growth as the world seeks to transition towards cleaner energy sources and reduce carbon emissions to combat climate change. Sustainable agriculture is another important green economy sector that promotes food production without compromising the environment’s long-term health. Sustainable farming methods include organic farming, agroforestry, and permaculture, which aim to minimize the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, conserve soil, and promote biodiversity. Sustainable agriculture also supports local economies by creating jobs and increasing food security while reducing the environmental impact of food production.   1.9.2 Strategies for promoting the green economy (e.g., incentives and regulations) Promoting the green economy requires a combination of strategies that incentivize environmentally sustainable practices and regulate harmful ones. Some of the strategies for promoting the green economy include the use of incentives, regulations, education, and investment in research and development. Incentives are a powerful tool for promoting the green economy. Governments can offer tax incentives to businesses that adopt sustainable practices such as reducing carbon emissions, using renewable energy sources, or implementing eco-friendly technologies. Incentives can also be offered to consumers, such as rebates or tax credits for purchasing electric vehicles, installing solar panels, or upgrading to energy-efficient appliances. Regulations are another strategy for promoting the green economy. Governments can impose regulations and standards that mandate businesses to adopt sustainable practices or limit their environmental impact. For example, governments can implement emission standards for industries such as transportation or manufacturing, require companies to report on their environmental impact, or ban the use of harmful chemicals or materials. Education and awareness-raising are also critical strategies for promoting the green economy. Governments, organizations, and businesses can educate consumers and employees on the benefits of adopting sustainable practices and the environmental impact of their actions. This can include promoting recycling, reducing waste, conserving energy, and supporting sustainable agriculture. In conclusion, investment in research and development is crucial for promoting a green economy. Governments can invest in research on new technologies and innovations that promote sustainability, such as renewable energy sources, energy storage, or carbon capture and storage. This can also include investments in sustainable agriculture practices, eco-friendly materials, and circular economy models.   1.10 Conclusions and future prospects 1.10.1 Summary Water conservation is an essential strategy for sustainable water management, reducing demand for freshwater and protecting water resources. Sustainable agriculture practices promote efficient use of water resources, reduce water pollution, and support food security.  Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power offer sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and supporting sustainable development. Proper wastewater management is critical for protecting public health and the environment, and strategies such as wastewater treatment, reuse, recycling, and resource recovery can promote sustainable use of water resources. However, inadequate infrastructure, funding, technical expertise, and weak regulatory frameworks pose challenges to proper wastewater management. To achieve SDGs related to water and the environment, governments, businesses, and individuals must work together to promote sustainable water management practices. Governments can provide policy incentives, regulations, and funding for sustainable water management projects, businesses can adopt water-efficient technologies and practices, and individuals can contribute to sustainable water management by practicing water conservation and proper waste disposal. In summary, several key points related to water, the environment, and their impact on sustainable development were discussed. The importance of water conservation, sustainable agriculture, renewable energy, and wastewater management for achieving SDGs was explored. The challenges and strategies for promoting sustainable water management practices were highlighted. It can be derived that the implementation of sustainable water management practices is crucial for achieving SDGs and protecting the environment. Further, by prioritizing sustainable water management practices and working together, we can create a sustainable future that provides clean water for all and preserves our planet for future generations.  1.10.2 Call to action for achieving sustainable development goals related to water and the environment Achieving SDGs related to water and the environment requires urgent action from governments, businesses, and individuals. The challenges of water scarcity, pollution, and inadequate wastewater management are becoming more severe, affecting public health, the environment, and economic growth. It is crucial to prioritize sustainable water management practices, such as water conservation, wastewater treatment, and reuse, and to adopt innovative and integrated approaches that promote sustainable use of water resources. Governments, businesses, and individuals must work together to promote sustainable water management practices. Governments can provide policy incentives, regulations, and funding for sustainable water management projects, such as wastewater treatment plants, water conservation  programs, and water reuse schemes. Businesses can adopt water-efficient technologies and practices, reduce water pollution, and promote sustainable use of water resources. Individuals can contribute to sustainable water management by practicing water conservation, using water-efficient fixtures, and properly disposing of household waste. In conclusion, achieving SDGs related to water and the environment is a collective responsibility that requires action from all sectors of society. We must prioritize sustainable water management practices, such as water conservation, wastewater treatment, and reuse, and adopt innovative and integrated approaches to protect public health, preserve the environment, and support economic growth. By working together, we can achieve a sustainable future that provides clean water for all and protects our planet for future generations.    References 1. Y. Yu  Y. Pi  X.
