                  There remains a pressing need for systematic water quality monitoring strategies to assess drinking water safety and to track progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). This study incorporated water quality testing into an existing national socioeconomic survey in Yogyakarta province, Indonesia; the first such study in Indonesia in terms of SDG tracking. Multivariate regression analysis assessed the association between faecal and nitrate contamination and drinking water sources household drinking water adjusted for wealth, education level, type of water sources and type of sanitation facilities. The survey observed widespread faecal contamination in both sources for drinking water (89.2%, 95%CI: 86.9–91.5%; n=720) and household drinking water (67.1%, 95%CI: 64.1–70.1%; n=917) as measured by Escherichia coli. This was despite widespread improved drinking water source coverage (85.3%) and commonly self-reported boiling practices (82.2%). E.coli concentration levels in household drinking water were associated with wealth, education levels of a household head, and type of water source (i.e. vender water or local sources). Following the proposed SDG definition for Target 6.1 (water) and 6.2 (sanitation), the estimated proportion of households with access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation was 8.5% and 45.5%, respectively in the study areas, indicating substantial difference from improved drinking water (82.2%) and improved sanitation coverage (70.9%) as per the MDGs targets. The greatest contamination and risk factors were found in the poorest households indicating the urgent need for targeted and effective interventions here. There is suggested evidence that sub-surface leaching from on-site sanitation adversely impacts on drinking water sources, which underscores the need for further technical assistance in promoting latrine construction. Urgent action is still needed to strengthen systematic monitoring efforts towards tracking SDG Goal 6.

Graphical abstract       There remains a pressing need for systematic water quality monitoring strategies to assess drinking water safety and to track progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). This study incorporated water quality testing into an existing national socioeconomic survey in Yogyakarta province, Indonesia; the first such study in Indonesia in terms of SDG tracking. Multivariate regression analysis assessed the association between faecal and nitrate contamination and drinking water sources household drinking water adjusted for wealth, education level, type of water sources and type of sanitation facilities. The survey observed widespread faecal contamination in both sources for drinking water (89.2%, 95%CI: 86.9–91.5%; n = 720) and household drinking water (67.1%, 95%CI: 64.1–70.1%; n = 917) as measured by Escherichia coli.  This was despite widespread improved drinking water source coverage (85.3%) and commonly self-reported boiling practices (82.2%). E.coli  concentration levels in household drinking water were associated with wealth, education levels of a household head, and type of water source (i.e. vender water or local sources). Following the proposed SDG definition for Target 6.1 (water) and 6.2 (sanitation), the estimated proportion of households with access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation was 8.5% and 45.5%, respectively in the study areas, indicating substantial difference from improved drinking water (82.2%) and improved sanitation coverage (70.9%) as per the MDGs targets. The greatest contamination and risk factors were found in the poorest households indicating the urgent need for targeted and effective interventions here. There is suggested evidence that sub-surface leaching from on-site sanitation adversely impacts on drinking water sources, which underscores the need for further technical assistance in promoting latrine construction. Urgent action is still needed to strengthen systematic monitoring efforts towards tracking SDG Goal 6.   Keywords Drinking water safety  Sanitation  Hygiene  Indonesia  Sustainable development goals    1 Introduction 1.1 The need for linking water safety and WASH surveys Improvements to WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) services can reduce diarrhoeal disease (Wolf et al., 2014 ). Water quality improvement and the impact of water quantity improvements have both been shown to have diarrhoea morbidity reductions (Waddington et al., 2009 ) while distance to the water source has been shown to positively impact on hygiene and so was associated with a reduction in diarrhoea prevalence, improved nutritional status and reduction in under-five child mortality (Pickering and Davis, 2012 ). A significant association between poor water quality and diarrhoea has been noted (Gruber et al., 2014 ), while Luby et al. (2015)  found an increasing risk of diarrhoea with higher levels of water quality contamination (significant above 100 E. coli  colony forming units (cfu)/100 mL). Though some examples exist of linked water quality work, for example in Ghana (WHO/UNICEF, 2015 ) Bangladesh (BBS/UNICEF, 2011 ), Nepal, Pakistan and Congo, there have been few examples of testing of water quality parameters into regular national household surveys and few, if any, to the authors knowledge, in the East Asia and Pacific region. Indeed such an approach is essential to better understand these interactions and design policy and operational responses (Cronin et al., 2015 ).  1.2 Indonesian and millennium development goals & Sustainable Development Goals for WASH Though expenditure in the water & sanitation sector has grown consistently in Indonesia, measured as a share of GDP, water supply and sanitation sector spending remains small at 0.2% of GDP or just less than 1% of total expenditure (World Bank, 2015 ); this is extremely low from an international perspective (OPM and UNICEF, 2016 ). One pressing concern is the low level of piped water supply onto household premises; currently only 22% nationally but the rural value is only 9% (WHO/UNICEF, 2015 ). Although 29.5% of the public use bottled and refilled water (i.e. water filled to a container belonging to the household) as their primary drinking source, the majority of these use re-filled water bottles (SUSENAS, 2015) and this entire supply mechanism is poorly regulated. The Millennium Development Goal (MDG) relating to water targeted increasing the access of the population to an improved water source and Indonesia has made good progress on provision of water from improved sources rising from 123 million in 1990–222 million in 2015 resulting in Indonesia meeting the water target of the MDGs. However, there is strong evidence that even improved water sources are not always safe Bain et al. (2014) . This is especially urgent in Indonesia given the high rates of open defecation (51 million) (WHO/UNICEF, 2015 ). I The need for integrated approaches on sanitation, hygiene and water management at household level are well understood by the Ministry of Health. An underlying piece of the national strategy towards Universal Coverage to safe water and sanitation in Indonesia is called “Scaling-up and Strengthening Community Approaches to Total Sanitation” (Sanitasi Total Berbasis Masyarakat  or STBM in the Bahasa Indonesia language). STBM prioritizes behaviour, as well as social change and community empowerment, across key pillars of WASH. A better understanding of drinking water quality could inform better messaging on the water handling pillar at household level. The Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs) have shifted the emphasis to quality and the proposed Goal 6 focuses on the achievement by 2030 of universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water and safely managed sanitation systems (UNICEF, 2016 ); however no national baseline for safe water exists in Indonesia which is required to track progress towards the SDG Target 6. To this end, BPS Statistics – Indonesia (the national bureau of statistics), Ministry of Health’s Centre for Environmental Health Engineering and Control of Diseases in Yogyakarta (BBTKLPP Yogyakarta), Ministry of Health (MoH), and the National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas) piloted a dedicated WASH survey with a water quality testing component as part of a national socio-economic survey (SUSENAS) in Yogyakarta province as a model with technical support from UNICEF. Primary findings were published in government reports (BPS, 2016a, 2016b ) and disseminated in government-organized national and sub-national meetings with a strong focus on the water quality elements though addressing sanitation and hygiene also. The present study builds on the government-led water quality survey by using their data and learnings to address following specific objectives:• to develop and test a water quality component into a well-established national socioeconomic survey along with a dedicated WASH questionnaire,  • to better capture current drinking water quality status at the water source and household levels in Yogyakarta province, Indonesia,  • to establish a baseline estimate for the SDG Target 6.1 on safe water (i.e. access to safely managed drinking water) and also for SDG Target 6.2 (on safe sanitation) in the study area and as a model for other Provinces in Indonesia,  • to explore the factors associated with faecal and chemical contamination at the water source and at the household level,  • to develop recommendations, based on the lessons learnt, both for interventions to mitigate water quality contamination at community and household levels as well as on future scaling up the integration with a water quality-household survey.      2 Material & methods 2.1 Planning process, study area and design The study was carried out in Yogyakata province, Indonesia, with a population of approximately 3.6 million and comprising of one Municipality and five Districts. The Province is regarded as one of the best served in Indonesia in WASH terms (and hence, potentially, a good comparative Province for any future potential similar studies) with 81.7% of the population with access to an improved water source and 72.1% with access to improved sanitation though access to piped water supply is still limited (14.1%) (RISKESDAS, 2013 ). BPS led the survey work and MoH analysed the water samples at BBTKLPP Yogyakarta. UNICEF provided technical support on both aspects. Water quality samples were taken by the staff of BPS who were trained by BBTKLPP based on the water sample collection protocol developed by BBTKLPP (BBTKLPP, 2015 ). Water samples were collected by BPS staff as part of the national socioeconomic survey (SUSENAS), while these samples were analysed in BBTKLPP which is nationally accredited for water quality testing. In addition to the collection of water samples and the administration of the planned SUSENAS survey questionnaire, that included standard socio-economic and demographic variables, an additional dedicated WASH survey was designed by BPS (with inputs from the other partners) and administered alongside the water quality sampling process (See Supplemental Material). In addition to a physical examination of the drinking water and direct observation of the place of handwashing by the enumerator, the household respondent was asked a series of questions concerning water storage, treatment, source of water and collection, hygiene, household and infant sanitation and recent illness among family members. This critical part of the work allowed a direct comparison of WASH parameters, water quality and socio-economic indicator making this one of the most comprehensive surveys of this type undertaken to date. The WASH survey was developed over a series of meetings between March and August 2015, hosted by BPS and attended by MoH, BBTKLPP Yogyakarta, Bappenas and UNICEF. Water quality parameters were discussed in preparatory meetings with BPS, MoH and UNICEF. All samples were analysed for Escherichia coli , nitrate and chloride in BBTKLPP by the full-time staff in the laboratory. Escherichia coli  is the standard indicator parameter for faecal contamination. E. coli  was enumerated using the membrane filtration method with rapid E. coli 2 agar (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Indonesia), following the manufacturer protocol. Laboratory blanks (i.e. sterile distilled water) were included every day to ensure no contamination occurs in the laboratory, while a duplicate sample was tested every 20 samples Both Nitrate and Chloride were included in the study given their potential as markers of anthropogenic contamination in water. Nitrate and chloride was measured by a spectrophotometer and chloride photometer, respectively and following the laboratory duplicate protocol. Nitrates in soil and groundwater are typically derived from the microbial degradation of organic nitrogenous material such as protein to ammonium ions that are then oxidised to nitrite and subsequently to nitrate by aerobic chemolithotrophs; anthropogenic sources include human waste and fertilizers (Hounslow 1995 ). Prevention of excessive N loadings to aquifer systems used for water supply is the optimal control option. No health-based guideline value is proposed for chloride in drinking-water though concentrations in excess of about 250 mg/litre can give rise to detectable taste in water and so this is regarded as the maximum allowable guideline value (WHO, 2004 ). Chloride values in groundwater may be affected by intrusion of seawater or brackish water; which is of interest in the coastal areas of the Province. Detailed sampling and transport planning were coordinated between BPS and BBTKLPP; all sampling was done in the morning with samples transported to the laboratory for analysis within a maximum period of 4 h post sampling. Samples were transported in cool boxes with ice packs inside. A dual coding system developed to cater for both organisations nomenclature standards. In addition, at the end of the survey, a handout on water quality and safe storage, handling and treatment methods were shared with households to encourage improved water handling and storage practices. All households identified to be visited by the SUSENAS sampling team were targeted for water quality sampling also; the number of sampled households in Yogyakarta city, Kulon Progo, Bantul, Gunung Kidul, and Sleman districts was 161, 158, 197, 190 and 211, respectively. Sampled households had two water quality samples collected − one at the point of consumption and one, when possible, at the corresponding source. In total, 917 household drinking water (HDW) samples were taken at the point of consumption, of which 183 HDW were from vendors (i.e. bottled or refilled drinking water). 734 drinking water sources were sampled over the entire month of September 2015. Source type was not a factor included into the survey design and so source type distribution is not representative of the source type per District; though such data was available (Table S1, Supplemental Material). All ethical and consent issues were part of the standard BPS process for national household surveys in Indonesia.  2.2 Estimation of the Sustainable Development Goal for drinking water According to Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) WHO/UNICEF, “safely managed drinking water” is defined as “population using improved drinking water source which is located on premises, available when needed and free of faecal (and priority chemical) contamination.” in the SDGs 6.1 (UNICEF, 2016 ). In this study, improved drinking water sources follows the JMP definition (WHO/UNICEF, 2015 ) and include piped water, tubewells, protected dug wells and spring, and rainwater; bottled water was considered improved drinking water source when households have another improved water source for domestic use. Drinking water sources on premises include drinking water sources located in their house or compound (i.e. yard) via direct observation, while water availability relied on self-reported results (each household was asked if they had ever had difficulty with daily use of their water sources last year in terms of water quantity.). Free from faecal contamination was defined as E. coli  less than 1 (cfu/100 mL) in the drinking water sources, which is in line with the Indonesian national drinking water standard (i.e. no detection of E. coli  in 100 mL). When improved drinking water source met all three criteria, it was counted as safely managed drinking water source.  2.3 Estimation of the Sustainable Development Goal for sanitation JMP WHO/UNICEF defines “safely managed sanitation” as “population using an improved sanitation facility which is not shared with other households and where excreta is safely disposed in situ or treated off-site, including a handwashing facility with water and soap”. Similar to drinking water sources, improved sanitation follows the JMP definition (WHO/UNICEF, 2015 ) and include pour-flush toilet connected to piped sewer system, septic tank and pit latrine; a pit latrine was considered improved sanitation when slab was present. Presence of a handwashing facility as well as availability of water and soap was directly observed by enumerators. Due to very limited data on faecal sludge management in Indonesia, proportion of sanitation facilities where excreta was safely treated was estimated based on methodologies described in the JMP methodological note (WHO/UNICEF, 2016 ). Briefly, proportion of households using improved sanitation connected to piped sewer and septic tank was calculated, separately. Each proportion was multiplied by integrated safety factors of which “Flush/pour flush to piped sewer” and “Flush/pour flush to septic tank” are 40% and 75%, respectively in the lower middle income country category (WHO/UNICEF, 2016 ). In this study, however, it was assumed that faecal sludge in on-site sanitation facilities in rural areas was 100% safely managed and treated, given that latrine emptying is rare (i.e. rare unsafe sludge collection/transportation/disposal and so safely containing faecal sludge) though little data exists on associated risks. Data on access to improved sanitation and handwashing facility are at household-level, while safely managed sanitation facilities cannot be specified at household level. Therefore, we first calculated the proportion of households with both improved sanitation and handwashing facility with water and soap, and then safe-excreta management/treatment component was factored in as described above to estimate overall proportion of safely managed sanitation coverage in the study area.  2.4 Conceptual model of faecal contamination in drinking water sources and HDW for statistical analysis A conceptual structured framework of faecal contamination in drinking water sources and HDW was developed to aid the analysis (Victora et al., 1997 ). As contamination pathways can be different in public and domestic domains, as described elsewhere (e.g. Cairncross et al., 1996 , Jensen et al., 2002 ), factors were categorized at three levels, namely socio-economic factors, public domain contamination factors and domestic domain contamination factors (Fig. S1 in Supplemental Material). Independent variables tested for each factor include:• Socio-economic factors: wealth tertile (i.e. each contains one third of the sampled population) based on expenditure (“richest”, “middle” and “poorest”), education level of a household head (“secondary or higher education” and “none or primary education”), residence status (“urban” and “rural”), and size of household (“less than 5 members” and “more than or equal to 5 members”).  • Public domain contamination factor: type of drinking water sources including three variables (“improved water sources” and “unimproved water sources” according to WHO/UNICEF JMP definition), (“piped supplies” and “non-piped supplies”), (“drinking water from vendors (i.e. bottled or refilled water)” or “drinking water from local sources”), sanitation access including two variables (“improved sanitation” and “unimproved sanitation” according to JMP definition (WHO/UNICEF, 2015 ) and (“private latrine” and “shared/communal latrine”), distance between water sources and the closest general/faecal waste disposal site (“< 10 m” and “≥ 10 m”), time to fetch water (continuous variable).  • Domestic domain contamination factor: access to handwashing facility including two variables (“presence of handwashing facility with water available” and “no access”) and (“presence of handwashing facility with both hand soap and water available” and “no access”), type of water storage container (“gallon/thermos/bottle”, “kettles/teapot”, “kendi/barrel”, “pots” and “dispenser”), water storage container with a lid (“yes” and “no”), regular container cleaning (“yes” and “no”), presence of any toddler in a household (“yes” and “no”), child faeces disposal (“safe disposal” and “unsafe disposal”), water treatment practice (“no treatment”, “boiling alone” and “boiling coupled with other treatment”), presence of any household member experiencing diarrhoea in the past month (“yes” and “no”).    For HDW regression analysis, all three levels were considered, while for DWS (drinking water source) regression analysis, domestic domain contamination factor was excluded as this factor is unlikely to affect contamination pathways of DWS.  2.5 Statistical analysis To construct multivariate models, univariate analysis was first conducted (see Table S2 in Supplemental Material). A predictor variable with a P  ≤ 0.20 from univariate results was included for each factor in the initial multivariate models. When more than one variable in the same category (e.g. three variables in type of water sources) met the inclusion criterion, P  ≤ 0.20, the one with the smallest P -value was included. We, then, sequentially dropped a variable with P >  0.10 at a time, starting from a variable with the largest P -value (i.e. a backward selection process), until the final models retained all remaining predictor variables with P <  0.10. Due to limited sample size and power to perform multivariate regression models, variable retain criterion P <  0.10 was set in constructing final multivariate models in order to capture both significant and potentially significant independent variables associated with faecal and nitrate contamination. In addition to regression models, we used a χ2  test to compare E. coli  detection rates between sample types, while a Mann–Whitney U  test was performed for comparison of median log10 E. coli  concentration. All analyses were conducted in SPSS ver. 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). In all analyses, P <  0.05 was considered significant.  2.6 Regression models for faecal and nitrate contamination in drinking water sources Due to high E. coli  detection rate in drinking water sources, we aimed at modeling E. coli  contamination as log concentration level (ordinal outcomes) using ordered logistic regression. The results, however, suggested violation of proportional odds assumption, and thus logistic regression was performed to model E. coli  contamination as two different binary outcome variables − (“detected (i.e., ≥ 1 (cfu/100 mL))” and “not-detected”) and (“≥ 100 (cfu/100 mL)” and “< 100 (cfu/100 mL)”), where cfu stands for colony forming units. For nitrate contamination, as the Indonesian maximum allowable concentration (MAC) for nitrate is 50 mg/L − nitrate, nitrate contamination was modeled as a binary outcome variable (“≥ 50 mg/L” and “< 50 mg/L”), and logistic regression was applied for the odds ratio calculation.  2.7 Regression models for faecal contamination in household drinking water (HDW) E. coli  contamination was modeled as log10 -transformed concentration level (ordinal outcomes). Factors associated with levels of E. coli  were explored by ordered logistic regression, which calculates odds ratio of being in a higher E. coli  log category. Half their lower detection limit (0.5 cfu/100 mL) was assigned for non-detected samples. Due to a skewed and zero-inflated distribution of E. coli  cfu counts, the data were collapsed into log10  categories (<1 cfu, 1–10cfu, 11–100cfu, and > 100 cfu per 100 mL). We did not examine factors associated with nitrate contamination in HDW because nitrate concentrations in drinking water sources and HDW were highly correlated (Pearson’s r  = 0.962, P <  0.001), i.e. little change in values was observed from source to household, indicating that nitrate contamination is likely to occur in public domains rather than within domestic domains.  2.8 Regression models for HDW faecal additional contamination Detection of HDW with more than one log higher in E. coli  level compared to their paired drinking water sources was defined as an occurrence of HDW additional contamination, i.e. contamination that occurred during transport, storage or handling of the water, and was modeled as a binary outcome variable. Odds ratio of HDW additional contamination occurrence was estimated by logistic regression.   3 Results 3.1 Faecal contamination in drinking water source (DWS) and household drinking water (HDW) E. coli  was detected in 89.2% (95%CI: 86.9–91.5%) of DWS (n  = 720) and 67.1% (95%CI: 64.1–70.1%) of HDW (n  = 917) (Fig. 1  ). Considering improved and unimproved water sources, 88.0% (95%CI: 85.4–90.5%) and 95.6% (95%CI: 91.9–99.4%) were contaminated with E. coli , respectively, and the difference in the detection rate was significant (χ2 , P <  0.05). The detection rate of E. coli  in HDW from local sources (n  = 734) and vendors including bottled and refilled water (n  = 183) was 71.0% (95%CI: 67.8–74.4%) and 50.8% (95%CI: 43.6–58.1%), respectively. E. coli  detection rate of HDW from vendors was significantly lower than that of HDW from local sources (χ2 , P <  0.05). The median log10  concentration of E. coli  in drinking water sources and HDW from local sources and vendors were 1.48, 0.39 and −0.04 (log10  cfu/100-mL), respectively (Fig. S2 in Supplemental Material). The difference in the median log10 E. coli  concentration was significant between all three sample types (Mann–Whitney U  test, P <  0.05). Proportion of samples ranging from 1 to 10, 11–100 and above 100 (E.coli  cfu/100-mL) was 23.5%, 38.7% and 27% of drinking water sources, respectively, 38.9%, 25.7% and 6.5% of HDW from local sources, respectively, and 38.2%, 10.4% and 2.2% of HDW from vendors, respectively (Fig. 2  ). Boiling was found to be the most commonly reported water treatment practice in the sampled households (82.2%), followed by use of a cloth filter (10.4%). Comparing E. coli  concentration between HDW and their DWS, self-reported boiled HDW showed 83% mean reduction of E. coli  levels. However, E. coli  was still detected in 70.4% of the self-reported boiled HDW.  3.2 Nitrate and chloride contamination in drinking water source (DWS) and household drinking water (HDW) Amongst the drinking water source tested, 6.6% (95%CI: 4.8–8.5%) showed higher nitrate concentration than the national drinking water MAC (i.e., 50 mg/L). Of drinking water sources in excess of the MAC for nitrate (n  = 48), 93.8% were from groundwater sources (i.e., wells). A similar rate of HDW from local sources exceeded the national drinking water MAC for nitrate (7.4%, 95%CI: 5.5–9.3%), while only 2.2% (95%CI: 0.0–4.3%) of HDW from vendors did so. Mean nitrate concentration in drinking water sources and HDW from local sources and vendors was 15.0 mg/L (Standard Deviation (SD) 19.9), 15.3 mg/L (SD 20.3) and 8.2 mg/L (SD 13.6), respectively. For chloride measurements, all tested samples met the national drinking water MAC (i.e., below 250 mg/L). Mean chloride concentration in drinking water sources and HDW from local sources and vendors was 20.4 mg/L (SD 19.6), 21.4 mg/L (SD 21.6) and 12.4 mg/L (SD 13.5), respectively.  3.3 Calculation of SDG target 6.1 and 6.2 In the sampled households where drinking water sources were collected and tested for E. coli , 84.1% had access to improved water sources. Improved water sources on premise and improved water sources that were available throughout last year were 73.4% and 77.6%, respectively while improved water sources negative for E. coli  was only 12%. Overall, when combining, the percentage of sampled households with access to safely managed drinking water sources was 8.5%, indicating substantial differences between MDGs (84.1% improved water sources) and SDGs figure (8.5% safely managed drinking water sources) in the study area (Fig. 3  ). Of the sampled households, 70.9% had access to improved sanitation. Proportion of households with access to both improved sanitation and handwashing facility with soap and water was 59.2%. When taking safely-treated faecal sludge on-site and off-site into account, proportion of households with access to safely managed sanitation was estimated to be 45.5% in the study areas (Fig. 4  ).  3.4 Factors associated with E. coli detection in drinking water sources (DWS) In the multivariate regression analysis, the education level of a household head, residence status (i.e., urban or rural) and water source type (i.e. piped or non-piped supplies) were found to be significant on detection of E. coli  (≥ 1 (cfu/100 mL)) in drinking water sources, while the wealth variable was not (Table 1  .). E. coli  was significantly more likely to be detected in drinking water sources collected from (1) households whose heads finished only primary or none of formal education than those finished secondary of higher education (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.98, 95%CI: 1.15–3.41), (2) rural districts than urban districts (aOR: 2.43, 95%CI: 1.32–4.47) and (3) non-piped water supplies than piped water supplies (aOR: 3.58, 95%CI: 2.09–6.16) (Table 2  ). For detection of higher level of E. coli  contamination (i.e. ≥ 100 (cfu/100 mL)), access to unimproved sanitation facility and presence of septic tank or other faecal waste disposal area within 10 m from the water source showed 1.7 times (aOR: 1.74, 95%CI: 1.10–2.76) and 1.5 times (aOR: 1.49, 95%CI: 0.98–2.25) higher likelihood of detecting E. coli  more than or equal to 100 (cfu/100 mL), respectively, in addition to a significant association with wealth tertile. There is no statistical evidence that improved water sources decrease the odds of detection of E. coli  (≥ 1 cfu/100 mL); nor for the very high risk E. coli  category (≥ 100 cfu/100 mL) in DWS.  3.5 Factors associated with nitrate contamination in drinking water sources (DWS) Odds of drinking water sources exceeding the national MAC for nitrate was 13.4 times and 2.6 times greater in urban districts (aOR: 13.38, 95%CI: 3.21–55.79) and in households using a shared/communal latrine compared to households using a private latrine (aOR: 2.61, 95%CI: 1.32–5.16), respectively (Table 3  ). Unlike E. coli  detection in drinking water sources, neither education level of a household head nor DWS type were associated with detection of excess level of nitrate.  3.6 Factors associated with E. coli levels in household drinking water (HDW) In HDW, levels of E. coli  were more likely to be higher in(1) poorer households compared to the richest households (aOR for poorest households: 1.65, 95%CI: 1.15–2.36), (aOR for middle wealth households: 1.51, 95%CI: 1.09–2.08),  (2) households with less educated household heads (aOR: 1.45, 95%CI: 1.11–1.91),  (3) rural districts (aOR: 1.37, 95%CI: 1.03–1.82)  (4) households using local sources (i.e. not from bottled and refilled water source) (aOR: 1.77, 95%CI: 1.25–2.50) (Table 4  ).    Both the lack of a handwashing facility with water and hand soap available at the handwashing facility were shown to be significantly associated with higher levels of E. coli  in HDW in univariate analysis. These variables, however, did not reach statistical significance in the final model (multivariate regression) and were not retained.  3.7 Factors associated with household drinking water (HDW) additional contamination occurrence Analysis of the HDW samples originating from local sources (i.e., not from bottled nor refilled water but instead wells etc.), found that 9.3% showed more than one log-level higher E. coli  concentration than their corresponding drinking water source result. The median log10  concentration of E. coli  in HDW where additional contamination occurred and in their drinking water sources were 1.86 and 0.00 (log10  cfu/100-mL), respectively (Fig.S3 in Supplemental Material). Odds of additional E. coli  contamination occurrence in HDW was significantly greater in households relying on shared/communal sanitation facilities than on private sanitation facilities (aOR: 1.87, 95%CI: 1.01–3.48) and in households without access to handwashing facility or with access to handwashing facility but no available water at time of survey (aOR: 1.95, 95%CI: 1.02–3.76) (Table 5  ). In addition, the type of water container was found to be significant in the occurrence of HDW additional contamination, while non-piped water supplies appeared to significantly decrease odds of HDW additional contamination (aOR: 0.47, 95%CI: 0.26–0.84).   4 Discussion This study has helped to better characterize the WASH situation in one Province in Indonesia which is of importance given the WASH impact on high levels of morbidity (RISKESDAS, 2013 ) and stunting (Torlesse et al., 2016 ) in the country. The high rates of positive E. coli  detection, two thirds at the point of consumption, are very worrying in this respect. While over 95% of the unimproved sources were contaminated, 88% of improved water sources had positive E. coli  detection. This is in line with the findings of Bain et al. (2014)  where over a quarter of samples from improved sources contained faecal contamination in 38% of 191 studies. Piped water supply had a significantly lower chance of E. coli  contamination compared to other drinking water sources (i.e. groundwater, spring and rainwater), but still 77% of piped supply samples taken as part of this study were found to be contaminated. While Bain et al. (2014)  estimated that 10% of improved water sources in low- and middle-income countries may have high risk of faecal contamination ( > 100 E. coli/ 100 mL), the results from this study found 6% of DWS have this level of contamination and this value is 27% for improved sources only (Fig. 2 ). It is apparent, that improved water source definition of the MDG is not sufficient for ensuring safe water and so the more comprehensive SDG Target 6.1 definition may help in this respect. In this study the coverage value drops significantly, going from 84% improved water coverage to 8.5% safely managed water (Fig. 3 ). The difference between improved sanitation coverage and safely managed sanitation coverage was less but still a decrease from 70.9% to 45.5% was calculated (Fig. 4 ). A similar analysis for Nepal found a drop from 91% improved water source coverage to 17% improved water sources free from faecal contamination (WHO/UNICEF, 2017 ). A recent analysis using Demographic Household Survey (DHS) or Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) data for 25 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa estimated 4.4% combined basic SDGs coverage (i.e. combined basic water, sanitation and hygiene access) (Roche et al., 2017 ). These findings suggest that Governments around the world may expect to see much lower starting rates for the SDGs targets as opposed to finishing rates for the MDGs. For achieving universal access to safely manage sanitation, it is critical to collect country-level data around faecal sludge management, and to improve the full sanitation chain in order to minimize any adverse impacts associated with on-site and off-site faecal sludge treatment processes. Another important element of the SGDs is around equity, i.e. levels of services reaching the poorest and most marginalised. It is clear that the poorest and least educated are significantly more likely to be accessing contaminated water (1.7 and 1.5 times are the respective increased likelihoods that these groups are accessing drinking water of a higher risk category of E. coli ). This is similar to the findings of Sodha et al. (2011)  and is consistent with the highest impact of poor WASH service provision in Indonesia also falling on these groups, both in terms of diarrhoea (Cronin et al., 2016 ) and stunting (Torlesse et al., 2016 ). While Chloride values measured in the study were low, Nitrate values in excess of MAC were observed (Fig. S4 and Fig. S5 in Supplemental Material). The Nitrate values in excess of MAC were more likely in urban areas and in households using a shared/communal latrine compared to households using a private latrine. This suggests a linkage between higher density sanitation areas and elevated nitrate levels, as suggested by others and that may be quantified by the N:Cl ratio (ARGOSS, 2001; Cronin et al., 2007 ). Previous work in Yogyakarta city suggested rapid urbanization and lack of sewered systems resulted in elevated nitrate and chloride levels in the city due to on-site sanitation (Putra, 2010 ). Our study found raw water N:Cl ratios (N = 723) ranged from 0 to 633 with a mean value of 2.1 and a median of 0.66. Median ratio values for Yogyakarta city, Kulon Progo, Bantul, Gunung Kidul, and Sleman districts were respectively 1.1, 0.1, 0.3, 1,1 and 1.1. The mean ratio for Yogyakarta city was 1.5, lower than the values of 2–2.5 found by Putra, (2010)  but still indicating excess nitrate from faecal origin. The high median values for Gunung Kidul, and Sleman districts may be similarly affected. The finding that improved sanitation and the presence of a septic tank within 10 m from a DWS were risk factors for detection of a high risk level of E. coli  (> 100 cfu/100 mL) also support the potential adverse effects of on-site sanitation on DWS quality. Further investigation around quality of construction, maintenance and faecal sludge management practices may help to better unpack these relationships; our results indicate that it may not be assumed that even improved sanitation will automatically result in adequate groundwater protection. The SDG focus on safely managed sanitation should help to better resolve this issue in the future. We did not find evidence that WASH facility and practice factors were associated with higher levels of E. coli  in HDW in this setting, although a few variables such as improved sanitation access and handwashing facility with water and soap were found to be significant or nearly significant in univariate regression analysis. This is likely due to relatively small variations within study communities (e.g. majority of households have access to handwashing facility with soap, practice safe child faeces disposal, etc.), in addition to high correlation with wealth tertile, resulting in insufficient statistical power to detect the effects across wealth levels. However, looking at risks of additional faecal contamination occurrence in HDW (i.e. one log level higher E. coli  level in HDW than in DWS), no access to handwashing facility with water was found to be a risk factor. It has been reported that contaminated hands could play a role in additional household drinking water contamination in developing countries (Mattioli et al., 2013; Schriewer et al., 2015; Pickering et al., 2010 ), and access to handwashing facility with water could be a proxy for handwashing practice, possibly minimizing such contamination within the domestic domain in this setting. Interestingly, we found evidence that use of shared/communal sanitation facility was a risk factor for additional faecal contamination occurrence of HDW, although there was no statistical difference in detection of E. coli  between households with private sanitation facility and shared/communal sanitation facility. A study in urban slums, India, found no statistical differences in faecal contamination of drinking water or hand-rinses, as measured by thermotolerant coliforms (TTC), between individual household latrine and shared sanitation users (Heijnen et al., 2015 ). However, the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) demonstrated that shared sanitation facility was a significant risk factor for moderate-to-severe diarrhoea in Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, and Pakistan, highlighting the need for better understanding of public and domestic domain contamination impacted by shared sanitation facility (Baker et al., 2016 ). In the study area, boiling was commonly reported as being practiced in the majority of households (82.2%), the value is similar to the value (87.6%) found in a previous study from South Sulawesi province, Indonesia (Sodha et al., 2011 ). It is, however, important to note that despite a 83% mean reduction of E. coli  in self-reported boiled drinking water, E. coli  contamination was not eliminated in 70% of these samples from our study area. Several studies also reported that boiling was associated with reduction of faecal indicator bacteria level, but did not result in a water that was completely free of contamination. In semi-urban India, rural Vietnam and Nepal, 40%, 61% and 72% of stored drinking water from self-reported boilers were contaminated with TTC or E. coli , respectively (Clasen et al., 2008a, 2008b; Kandel et al., 2016 ), while 40% were contaminated with E. coli  in rural Indonesia (Sodha et al., 2011 ). A study in post-disaster situations, conducted in three districts of Aceh province, Indonesia, demonstrated that reported boiling was not associated with decreased odds of E. coli  detection in stored drinking water in any of the study areas (Gupta et al., 2007 ). Plausible explanations for E. coli  contamination in self-reported boiled water include improper boiling procedure, post-boiling contamination due to unsafe water storage and handling, and self-report bias (Gupta et al., 2007 ). This underscores the fact that self-reported boiling practice may not be assumed to lead to safe water (i.e. reinforcing the importance of water quality monitoring at point of consumption), and that household-level safe water practice need to be further strengthened in order to achieve household drinking water free from faecal contamination. It is clear that action is required at several levels to address the serious water quality challenges identified by the survey. At the household level the STBM program provides clear messages on the importance of safe water transport, handling and storage. More intensive engagement with communities on these messages is required to reduce potential for water contamination from the source to the point of consumption. However, other messages also need to be addressed − for instance the sub-optimal treatment impact of boiling but also on sanitation − for instance almost 40% of the faeces of children 0–4 years of age are not safely disposed of to a latrine, a serious driver of child diarrhoea in Indonesia (Cronin et al., 2016 ). Community level interventions are also needed to address the almost ubiquitous contamination of sources. Water Safety Planning (e.g. WHO, 2009 ) is an approach that communities can use to reduce risks of contamination of water sources and may also be actively explored by local water supply bodies and local community water associations. Together the community identify and address risks to drinking-water safety and take preventive action and the concept can be applied from the household well to the distribution network for an urban area. The key is to take simple measures to reduce the risk of contamination of the water system or to optimise the treatment required. Such practical but systematic approaches to monitoring and management could help enormously poor households to have access to safe water. Finally at the higher administrative levels, routine analysis could be better compiled to track progress towards the SDGs by developing an alert system to trigger corrective action. This may also be linked to process level indicators to ensure the focus of the monitoring system is on corrective action and improvement and not solely for the purpose of reporting (e.g. Cronin and Thompson, 2014 ). In addition, further scale-up of such an approach in other Provinces to Indonesia is required to track progress of the SDG Target 6 around increasing access to safely managed WASH services. The design and implementation of this survey was a time intensive process but this experience now has led to the development of all of the necessary protocols and questionnaires (see Supplemental Material) and capacity building materials (e.g. BBTKLPP, 2015 ) to facilitate scaling up. Scaling up will also increase understanding of local and regional drivers of contamination as well as to better fit the most appropriate solutions to the local context.  5 Limitations This study has several important limitations. First, our sample size was determined based on the September 2015 SUSENAS survey that was designed for provincial level estimates. However, due to temporal and spatial heterogeneity of water quality data, and varying hydrogeological conditions, our results should not be generalized beyond the sampled population. Second, our study design, where samples were collected at point of collection (i.e. drinking water source) and consumption (i.e. household drinking water), did not allow us to identify drivers of contamination between the point of collection and consumption. A greater suite of parameters (organic, inorganic and microbiological) would also be ideally measured − future research or routine monitoring may consider to expand this parameter range. Third, this cross-sectional study was conducted over one month just before the onset of the rainy season, and hence potentially important temporal and seasonal variability of faecal and chemical contamination could not be captured. Fourth, wealth tertile calculations were based on expenditure per capita in this study, which may have limited ability to reflect actual socio-economic status due to the approximate current household wealth status. Fifth, better country level data would have allowed for more accurate estimation of the safely managed sanitation coverage. However, due to the absence of detailed faecal sludge management data in Indonesia, it was estimated based on the global approaches. Lastly, despite our efforts to confirm survey results by direct observation, some of our data were self-reported and are potentially subjected to recall, social desirability and other types of biases.  6 Conclusions Water quality testing and a dedicated bespoke WASH survey were successfully developed and piloted into an existing national socioeconomic household survey through strong cross-Government collaboration; this is among the first known examples for Indonesia and the South-East Asia region. Further work may look at how to further replicate and strengthen the approach, especially in terms of helping to better track progress on the SDG Targets 6.1 and 6.2. This would be especially important to ensure equitable service provision as this pilot presents strong evidence that risks of faecal exposure via drinking water are the greatest in the poorest households. This would indicate that access to safe water is unevenly distributed and effective interventions targeting poorest households are needed to achieve SDGs. Given the observed frequent and widespread faecal contamination in both drinking water sources and household drinking water, as measured by E. coli , water safety cannot be always assumed by access to improved water sources, purchase of water nor self-reported water treatment practices, pointing to the urgent need for strengthening water quality programs at the source and point of use; routine analysis currently on-going could be employed to trigger corrective action. Water safety measures around source management and water supply needs urgent attention. Behaviour change communication leading to the improvement of household practices is also critical; an opportunity to intensify such efforts lie under the MoH’s STBM program in Indonesia. This would also support efforts on handwashing with soap, found to be important in this study as a potential barrier to additional water contamination in the home. The observed protective benefits against additional faecal contamination of household drinking water by private sanitation facility and handwashing facility with water suggest that sanitation and hygiene promotion, together with proper water treatment, handling and storage practices are critical to prevent faecal contamination in the domestic domain. Shared/communal sanitation facility appeared to be a risk factor for nitrate contamination in drinking water (i.e. public domain contamination) and additional faecal contamination of HDW (i.e. domestic domain contamination), suggesting that there are multiple public and domestic contamination pathways associated with shared/communal sanitation facility. Further research is needed to better understand risks associated with shared/communal sanitation as well as the need to collect more country-level data around faecal sludge management. From N:Cl ratios it may be deducted that groundwater is impacted by sub-surface leaching from on-site sanitation, especially in more densely populated areas. This underscores the continued need for standards of construction, and systems to ensure adherence to these standards in order to minimize risks of both faecal and nitrate contamination in public domain as well as looking beyond faecal waste containment to safe sludge management, as aimed for with SDG Target 6.2. Towards universal access to safely-managed water, and sanitation and hygiene, this is the first study to establish the baseline for SDGs Target 6.1 on water and Target 6.2 on sanitation within Indonesia, with Yogyakarta province as a model. From the significant drop from the calculated MDG improved service to the SDG safely managed values it may be expected that many countries will experience similar decreases. The results underscore the pressing need for urgent and accelerated action, based on practical, scientifically sound evidence and socially acceptable approaches, to strengthen systematic monitoring frameworks to track progress towards the SDG goals of universal sustainable and equitable WASH access by 2030.
