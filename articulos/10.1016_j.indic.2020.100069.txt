                  Natural capital protection is critical to humanity because biodiversity and ecosystem provide not only goods (e.g., food, energy, water) but also services (e.g., climate regulation, cultural amenities). The article discusses the performance on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) for natural capital protection, by framing the green growth concept into four pillars (i.e. environmental quality, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction, ecosystem and biodiversity protection, and cultural and social value). Natural capital protection is one of the four dimensions of the Green Growth Index developed by the Global Green Growth Institute to measure country performance in green growth transition. The indicators selected for natural capital protection are either SDG indicators or directly contributing to SDG targets. Benchmarked against sustainability targets for the SDGs, Aichi Biodiversity, and the Paris Climate Agreement, the performance scores directly measure the distance to achieving the SDGs. Because the indicators for natural capital protection have not been explicitly framed in other global green growth indices and benchmarked against sustainability targets, hence, the article fills in an important research gap. The results revealed that many regions are performing better in environmental quality and GHG emissions reduction, but struggling to improve the low performance in biodiversity and ecosystem protection as well as cultural and social values. Many countries in Asia and Oceania face an enormous challenge of improving performance in the share of Key Biodiversity Areas covered by protected areas and the potential level of soil biodiversity. If biodiversity loss due to deforestation and intensive farming will continue, the countries will lose the ability to achieve sustainability targets in reducing GHG emissions and environmental quality. The highest average performance scores for the regions are only about 80. Thus, there is still a significant gap in achieving sustainability targets (i.e. 100) in natural capital protection, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa region.

Natural capital protection is critical to humanity because biodiversity and ecosystem provide not only goods (e.g., food, energy, water) but also services (e.g., climate regulation, cultural amenities). The article discusses the performance on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) for natural capital protection, by framing the green growth concept into four pillars (i.e. environmental quality, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction, ecosystem and biodiversity protection, and cultural and social value). Natural capital protection is one of the four dimensions of the Green Growth Index developed by the Global Green Growth Institute to measure country performance in green growth transition. The indicators selected for natural capital protection are either SDG indicators or directly contributing to SDG targets. Benchmarked against sustainability targets for the SDGs, Aichi Biodiversity, and the Paris Climate Agreement, the performance scores directly measure the distance to achieving the SDGs. Because the indicators for natural capital protection have not been explicitly framed in other global green growth indices and benchmarked against sustainability targets, hence, the article fills in an important research gap. The results revealed that many regions are performing better in environmental quality and GHG emissions reduction, but struggling to improve the low performance in biodiversity and ecosystem protection as well as cultural and social values. Many countries in Asia and Oceania face an enormous challenge of improving performance in the share of Key Biodiversity Areas covered by protected areas and the potential level of soil biodiversity. If biodiversity loss due to deforestation and intensive farming will continue, the countries will lose the ability to achieve sustainability targets in reducing GHG emissions and environmental quality. The highest average performance scores for the regions are only about 80. Thus, there is still a significant gap in achieving sustainability targets (i.e. 100) in natural capital protection, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa region.   Keywords Biodiversity  Ecosystem services  GHG emissions  Green growth  Natural capital  Sustainable development goals    1 Introduction Among the five forms of capital1  1 Financial capital includes savings, income, and pensions; human capital includes knowledge, skills, and health; social capital includes networks, trust, and mutual exchange; and physical capital includes shelter, water, sanitation, and energy.   – natural, financial, human, social, and physical – natural capital including water, land, forests, and minerals amongst others are considerably the most fundamental form of capital, providing basic conditions and provisions for human existence (Sapountzaki, 2007 ; Jermalavičius and Parmak, 2012 ; EEA, 2015 ). Natural capital covers not only the resources used in production processes (biotic or abiotic), but also in ecosystem services provided by nature (Milligan et al., 2014 ). The latter includes provisioning, regulating, and cultural and supporting services through the natural functioning and interaction of ecosystems (Milligan et al., 2014 ; Costanza et al., 2017 ). These ecosystem functions and interactions provide various benefits to humans, which Costanza et al. (2014)  valued at approximately USD 125 trillion in 2011. The importance of biodiversity in sustaining ecosystem services is widely recognized (Cleland, 2011 ), nonetheless biodiversity loss has become an increasing concern globally. According to a report, “the world is already facing the mass extinction of species” (Earth Day Network, 2018 ). Biodiversity loss is evident worldwide, reducing the ability of natural capital to regenerate and contribute to people's well-being (Suzuki, 2018 ). Combined with impacts of climate change, reduction in ecosystem services due to biodiversity loss will make the earth less habitable not only for a large number of species but also for humans. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions notably increased by 1.2% in 2017 (Olivier and Peters, 2018 ). The pollution increased causing a decline in air quality (CCAC, 2018 ). Every year, 7 million people die due to ambient (outdoor) and household air pollution (WHO, 2018 ). Moreover, overfishing caused a decline in marine fisheries, with 33.1% of stocks classified as overfished in 2015 (FAO, 2018a ). In the face of these challenges, natural capital protection is critical to humanity. It is particularly crucial for green growth since societies depend on biodiversity and ecosystem for their goods and services. According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 2011 ), green growth pertains to the natural resources continuously providing environmental services. Similarly, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN ESCAP, 2013 ) emphasizes that green growth includes the need to improve the natural capital of the earth. One can generate the benefits from natural capital from the interference of human beings (Natural Capital Committee, 2014 ). But in the past, people exploited natural capital mainly for economic benefits with limited considerations of environmental impacts such as biodiversity loss and resource depletion. This threatens the main objective of green growth to balance economic growth and environmental protection (Vazquez-Brust et al., 2014 ). In framing the Green Growth Index, which the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) first published in 2019, natural capital protection is one of the four important dimensions of green growth (Acosta et al., 2019a ). It has close interlinkages with efficient and sustainable resource use, green economic opportunities, and social inclusion. Efficient and sustainable resource use involves using natural capital more productively and producing more economic value with fewer resources (ECN, 2013 ) and without compromising people's future well-being. It thus directly contributes to the protection of natural capital such as water, energy, land, and materials as well as the ecosystem services (Flachenecker and Rentschler, 2018 ). Without natural capital protection, the provisioning, regulating, and cultural and supporting services of the ecosystem are at risk. Moreover, natural capital is core to green growth because of its role in generating new sources of growth and expanding economic opportunities in the form of green investment and jobs, among other opportunities (OECD, 2011 ). But green growth also emphasizes the role of people (Bass et al., 2016 ), where social inclusion becomes a key mechanism for people to not only contribute, sustain, and distribute economic benefits, but also protect the sources of this growth – the natural capital. This article discusses the indicators of natural capital protection that are relevant to green growth and presents an analysis of green growth performance on natural capital protection globally. While there are few global composite indicators and indices that measure performance and progress in green growth (e.g. (AfDB, 2015 , 2014 ; Jha et al., 2018 ; PAGE, 2017a , 2017b ; Tamanini and Valenciano, 2016 ), only GGGI's Green Growth Index has conceptualized natural capital protection as a key composite dimension of green growth. Moreover, it is the only measure of green growth performance that benchmarked natural capital protection to sustainability targets such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Aichi Biodiversity Targets. We structured the article as follows: Section 2  presents the concept of natural capital protection in the context of green growth and its link to the SDGs; Section 3  discusses the data and methods for selecting and analysing indicators for natural capital protection; Section 4  presents and discusses the results; and Section 5  provides the conclusion.  2 Natural capital protection indicators 2.1 Natural capital protection for green growth The Green Growth Index comprises four dimensions: efficient and sustainable resource use, green economic opportunities, natural capital protection, and social inclusion. Its conceptual framework builds on GGGI's definition of green growth:“Green growth is a development approach that seeks to deliver economic growth that is both environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive. It seeks opportunities for economic growth that are low-carbon and climate-resilient, prevents or remediate pollution, maintains healthy and productive ecosystems, and create green jobs, reduce poverty, and enhance social inclusion.”  (GGGI, 2017 :p.12).    The indicators for efficient and sustainable resource use   include the use of the main natural resources such as water, land, energy, and materials. The indicators for green economic opportunities   consist of employment, innovation, investment, and trade. These two dimensions and their indicators are significant to the low carbon economy concept. The indicators for natural capital protection   consist of biodiversity and ecosystem protection, environmental quality, GHG emissions reduction, and cultural and social value. The indicators for social inclusion   consist of social equality, social protection, gender balance, and access to basic services and resources. These two dimensions and their indicators are significant to the resilient society concept. The conceptual framework for the Green Growth Index considers the four dimensions as closely interlinked with each other. For example, the concept of ecosystem health suggests that the protection of natural capital can be achieved from environmental management, which includes the efficient and sustainable use of natural resources. The natural capital protection and resource efficiency dimensions are connected, having natural feedback systems, because natural capital conservation and restoration are also significant in progressing to the green economy (ten Brink et al., 2012 ). Similarly, the inclusive growth concept highlights the co-production of economic growth and social inclusion such as the creation of innovative green opportunities (Walby, 2018 ). Finally, economic opportunities will not be sustainable without people protecting natural capital. This article only focuses on the indicators of natural capital protection, those for other dimensions are discussed elsewhere (Acosta et al., 2019a ). Each sustainability pillar for natural capital protection has three indicators (Fig. 1  ), which were identified through literature review and expert consultations. Details on the indicators including data sources are presented in section 3.2.1  and Appendix A, and their relevance is briefly described below. 2.1.1 Environmental quality Environmental quality refers to properties and characteristics of the environment which may affect the health of human beings and other organisms, including air, water, and noise pollution, access to open space, and visual impacts of buildings (EEA, 2017 , 2015 ). The indicators for environmental quality include particulate matter (PM)2.5 air pollution, disability-adjusted life years (DALY) rate due to unsafe water sources, and municipal solid waste (MSW). Particulate matter has harmful effects on human health. PM2.5 is the most commonly used indicator for estimating the effects of air pollution on mortality. It provides a good indicator on health impacts considering that it is ranked as a fifth mortality risk factor in 2015 and exposure to it over a period of one year or more causes around 95% of the 3 million deaths globally per year (Denier van der Gon et al., 2015 ; Tessum et al., 2017 ). Safe water resources are significant in maintaining human welfare and health (Hunter et al., 2010 ). The demand for safe water has increased because living standards have also improved (Gu et al., 2014 ). Globally, more than 2 billion people do not have access to safe water resources (Wendling et al., 2018 ). In developing countries, diarrhea caused by poor drinking water quality is one of the most common contributors to the disease burden as measured by DALY. Solid wastes affect the quality of water, land, and air. A large amount of household solid wastes is causing many negative impacts on humans and the ecosystem (Azodo and Ismaila, 2016 ). Economic growth, consumption patterns, and the degree of industrialization also contribute to the generation of excessive solid wastes. Solid wastes are a byproduct of urban growth. The rapid growth of the urban population results in more MSW. Additionally, the lack of technology and efficient methods to dispose of solid wastes contributes to the deterioration of air quality (Tahir et al., 2015 ).  2.1.2 GHG emissions reduction Greenhouse gas emission reduction refers to the reduction and removal of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) and non-CO2  emissions from the atmosphere to address climate change (Planton, 2013 ; Symon, 2013 ). In 2012, CO2  comprises around three-quarters of total GHG emissions (Ritchie and Roser, 2019 ). In China, its cities' total carbon emissions are linked to its GDP. The carbon emissions per unit area and the cities’ population density are strongly connected (Wang et al., 2012 ). Therefore, carbon emission per capita is a more significant indicator of measuring impacts on the environment (Guardian, 2016  ). Other sources of GHG emissions include methane and nitrous oxide (non-CO2 ), which accounts for about 17% and 7% of emissions, respectively. Globally, the agriculture and energy sectors contribute around 90% of methane emissions. The agriculture sector alone is the source of more than 60% of nitrous oxide emissions. Thus, it is significant to have a different indicator for this sector due to the significance of non-CO2  emissions in Agriculture (GE3) (Ritchie and Roser, 2019 ).  2.1.3 Biodiversity and ecosystem protection Protection of biodiversity and ecosystem pertains to the conservation of ecosystems, species, and habitats as well as their services. The protected areas are one of the significant measures to attain biodiversity conservation (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN, 2016 ; IPBES, 2018 ). The indicators for this pillar include the share of terrestrial, freshwater, and marine key biodiversity areas (KBAs) covered by protected areas, share of forest area to total land area, and soil biodiversity index. Establishing protected areas has become a major strategy to conserve biodiversity and well-managed protected areas enhance ecosystem health, benefitting humans. These benefits include ecosystem services such as food security, disaster risk reduction, and clean water (Bertzky et al., 2012 ). The integration of protected areas in land use plans addresses issues on species loss and climate change adaptation (Lopoukhine et al., 2012 ). This is particularly relevant for forest areas, which help conserve natural resources and contribute to their sustainable growth by protecting the water resources and enhancing biodiversity. The forestry sector can contribute to climate change mitigation by expanding opportunities to enhance renewable energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Generally, forests contribute to green building and infrastructure and act as carbon sinks (UNECE, 2010 ). Soil biodiversity indicates the potential level of diversity living in soils (Doula and Sarris, 2016 ; FAO , n.d.). They provide significant services to sustain the ecosystem because these living organisms and the different plants and animals in the ecosystems interact with each other. They regulate the dynamics of the organic matter, GHG emissions, and carbon sequestration in the soil (Corsi et al., 2012 ). They also increase the efficiency of getting nutrients and improving plant health (Scialabba, 2000 ).  2.1.4 Cultural and social value Cultural and social value refers to the societal value given to natural capital due to its importance to communities and their local culture which encourages sustainable use and protection of natural resources (Small et al., 2017 ; da Rocha et al., 2017 ). The indicators for this pillar include Red List Index, tourism and recreation in marine areas, and share of terrestrial and marine protected areas to total territorial areas. The Red List Index is a commonly used system to assess the risk of and quantify the threats to a species to go extinct (Kideghesho, 2009 ). There is a significant number of species that are threatened to be extinct despite the different efforts to conserve them. Some of the factors that contribute to their extinction include pollution, overexploitation, destruction, and the introduction of exotic species. The highly valued species are counted as cultural indicators and important in developing rehabilitation projects with the local communities (Harmsworth et al., 2011 ). The value of the symbolic species depends on its existence in a specific cultural area, it increases when they are rare and their habitats are inaccessible (Schirpke et al., 2018 ). Tourism, particularly related to nature, has become an important industry since the 1980s (Zeldovich, 2019 ). Ecotourism is an “environmentally responsible travel and visitation to relatively undisturbed natural areas” for recreation and cultural purposes (IUCN, 1996 as cited in Lanier, 2014 ). Through marine ecotourism, conservation of natural capital becomes a mechanism to contribute to human wellbeing (iLCP, 2016 ). Ecotourism can provide not only sources of income but also recreation. It also improves the locals’ wellbeing and promotes responsible tourism (Zambrano et al., 2010 ). Moreover, it helps in the environment conservation efforts when ecosystems and their inhabitants are managed well (Zeldovich, 2019 ). Protected areas are dedicated and managed geographical space to achieve the long-term conservation of nature's ecosystem services and cultural values (IUCN, 2008 ). At present, there are around 200,000 protected areas. It covers about 14.6% of the land areas and 2.8% of the ocean areas (IUCN , n.d.). Protected areas include not only the scientific areas that cannot be publicly accessed and areas that are managed sustainably but also the cultural and historical areas. Cultural services are distinct characteristics of many protected areas due to their picturesque and pristine nature (Stolton et al., 2015 ).   2.2 Sustainability targets for natural capital Many indicators in the Green Growth Index were derived from the SDGs and benchmarked using SDG targets because the SDGs provide an excellent framework for green growth transition (GGGI, 2017 ). Moreover, aligning the indicators with the SDGs and other sustainability targets such as Aichi Biodiversity and Paris Climate Agreement enhances their policy relevance for green growth performance measurement. Benchmarking against sustainability targets enables the countries to visualize easily their level of performance in achieving the SDGs, similar to the OECD's Measuring Distance to the SDG Targets (OECD, 2019 ). Fig. 2   presents the relationship of the indicators for natural capital protection to the SDG indicators. Half of the 12 natural capital protection indicators are from the SDGs, while the remaining half are directly related to the SDG targets. The indicator on the share of terrestrial and marine protected areas to total territorial areas is in both categories because while the share of marine protected areas is currently in the list of SDG indicators, the share of terrestrial protected areas is not. The latter is, however, included as an indicator for Aichi Biodiversity Target. Soil biodiversity contributes to Aichi Strategic Goal C to improve the status of biodiversity by safeguarding ecosystems, species, and genetic diversity. CO2  and non-CO2  emissions per capita, excluding agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) as well as non-CO2  emissions in agriculture per capita (GE3), have a large impact on the Paris agreement's objective to keep the global average temperature to below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels.   3 Data and methods 3.1 Indicator selection Three main iterative steps were followed for the selection of indicators – determine scientific evidence, check consistency with the objectives, and assess relevance to policy. Each step is discussed below. 3.1.1 Scientific evidence The first step in selecting indicator was to determine the relevance to the concept being measured. The conceptual framework for the Green Growth Index provided guidance on the choice of indicators for the dimensions including natural capital protection. To give scientific evidence on the indicators’ relevance to the dimensions and pillars of green growth, in particular natural capital protection, a literature review was done (examples are presented in section 2.1 ). But the metrics or data selected to measure these indicators can be subjective, particularly when the “desired data” are not available (OECD and JRC, 2008 ). As a result, some indicators are only alternatives because the desired indicators are either unavailable or relevant data are lacking. Table 1   provides the desired improvements on the indicators.  3.1.2 Objective consistency The second step in selecting the indicators was to check their consistency with the objectives and purpose of developing the Green Growth Index. Because the Index aims to measure green growth performance across countries and regions over time, the main criteria used in indicator selection are as follows: (i) coverage of more than 140 countries; (ii) availability of time series data to allow updates of the Index on a regular interval; and (iii) accessibility of the data to allow replication of methods and check the credibility of their sources to enhance data acceptability. The goal was to have wide coverage of data in the number of years and countries; however, some relevant indicators did not meet it. With respect to natural capital protection, there was only a one-year data for the MSW generation per capita and soil biodiversity. These indicators are only alternatives and will be changed in the next few years with a more desired data. Recently, FAO  is developing other soil-related database which will be an alternative source of data for soil biodiversity. The indicator for MSW is expected to be replaced with MSW collection coverage (SDG Indicator 11.6.1) as data availability improves. Detailed descriptions including limitations of the indicators that were selected for natural capital protection are provided in Appendix A .  3.1.3 Policy relevance The third step in selecting the indicators was to assess their relevance to policy relating to natural capital protection. The assessments were conducted through participatory processes such as stakeholder workshops, expert meetings, and online survey (Acosta et al., 2019a , 2019b ). More than 300 experts including policymakers from different regions and experts from different international organizations participated in the process over the period from 2017 to 2019. In 2017, in-country stakeholder workshops were conducted in Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines. The participants were officials from different government agencies. In 2018, regional stakeholder workshops were conducted for the regions in Asia-Pacific, Middle East and North Africa (MENA), Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Participants were mainly government officials working on green growth issues. Other participants were green growth experts from regional organizations (e.g. African Development Bank, United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific) and academe. In 2017 and 2018, three international expert meetings were conducted in Seoul, Geneva, and Rome. In each of these events, the feedback on the policy relevance of indicators in each green growth dimensions, collected from policymakers and experts, was used to iteratively improve the indicators for the green growth framework. Participants were members of the International Expert Group, which was formed to support the development of the Green Growth Index. The members are experts on green growth indicators from the United Nations and other international institutions, non-government organizations, and European governments and academes. Finally, in 2019, an online survey was conducted to collect final feedback from not only the policymakers and international experts who participated in the workshops and meetings, but also experts from GGGI's headquarters and country offices.   3.2 Data collection and preparation 3.2.1 Data availability and sources The data for the indicators in the Green Growth Index are available online. These data were gathered from international organizations, thus, there is an advantage in terms of its consistency and availability to measure the performance across countries. Data for the natural capital protection are available for at least 184 countries, but three indicators lack most recent data for three countries (Table 2  ). Simple imputation was applied to complete the dataset, i.e. by using the data available from the closest year. As mentioned in section 3.1.2 , the MSW generation per capita (EQ3) and soil biodiversity (BE3) indicators currently lack time-series data. But as this article only focuses on results from most recent data, this issue is not relevant and has no implication on the analysis.  3.2.2 Data outliers and capping Because outliers can affect the statistical properties (e.g. mean, standard deviation, covariance, correlation) (Mishra, 2008 ) and normalized values of the indicators (Nardo et al., 2005 ; OECD and JRC, 2008 ), it is important to identify and, if necessary, remedy them. Half of the indicators showed outliers in data for several countries, with the ratio of non-CO2 emissions to population, excluding AFOLU (GE2) showing the highest number of outliers for 17 countries (Table 3  ). The data for these countries were capped using either lower or upper fences, depending on the values of the outliers. Because the outliers for the six indicators were all above the upper fences, these were used for capping (i.e. extreme values were replaced by the upper fence values). The fences were computed using the following equation:Equation 1 I Q R  =  75 t h  p e r c e n t i l e  –  25 t h  p e r c e n t i l e    L o w e r  f e n c e  =  25 t h  p e r c e n t i l e  –  μ × I Q R    U p p e r  f e n c e  =  75 t h  p e r c e n t i l e  +  μ × I Q R        Where μ  =  3.0    the multiplier.   3.3 Data validation 3.3.1 Correlation analysis Correlation analysis was conducted to determine the unnecessary indicators that have a very strong correlation, generating double counting on the coefficient values or weights, and validate if the indicators are associated to their corresponding dimensions. Moreover, bivariate correlation was used in analyzing the association strength between the indicators. Although there is lack of consensus on how to rate the values of the coefficients, many studies agree that “a coefficient of less than 0.1 indicates a negligible and more than 0.9 a very strong relationship, values in between are disputable” (Schober et al., 2018 : p.1765). For this analysis, mid-range values of the coefficients between 0.69 and 0.30 are considered ideal, and values below and above these values (except for less than 0.1 indicates and more than 0.9) are considered acceptable. The correlation can be categorized as within and outside the pillars, where within refers to the indicators that belong to the same pillar. The indicators within the pillars are expected to show some degree of correlation, implying that they have some common characteristics that contribute to a particular pillar. The correlation of the indicators with those outside the pillars should be negligible as possible, or zero, so that the pillars will be independent of each other. Fig. 3   shows that no indicators are redundant because correlation coefficients are all below 0.70 (highest coefficient value that is statistically significant is 0.53, as shown Appendix B ). Out of the 12 coefficients within pillars, about 40% are statistically significant and with ideal level of coefficients. Out of the 54 coefficients outside the pillars, significant numbers of indicators are statistically insignificant. Less than 25% of the significant coefficients have values over 0.30. This implies that there is high level of independence between the indicators outside the pillars. Some of the indicators within the pillars show insignificant coefficients including the three GHG emissions reduction (GE1, GE2, and GE3), soil biodiversity (BE3), and share of terrestrial and marine protected areas to total territorial areas (CV3). The insignificant correlation between the indicators for GHG emissions may have been caused by the presence of relatively large number of outliers for these indicators (Table 3 ). The relationship of these indicators within the pillar was further investigated using scatter analysis.  3.3.2 Scatter analysis To further analyze the relationship between indicators, scatter analysis of the pillar scores (i.e. aggregated values of the normalized indicators) was conducted and plotted against the aggregated scores of the natural capital protection (see aggregation methods in section 3.4.2 ). The scatterplots in Fig. 4   reveal the strong linear relationship particularly above middle range scores. The closest relationship to the natural capital pillar scores is evident in biodiversity and ecosystem protection, with scores gathering more closely on the mean (represented by the line). Although soil biodiversity (BE3) did not show significant correlation with average proportion of Key Biodiversity Areas (BE1), Appendix C  reveals that their scatterplots show almost similar pattern. Similarly, while the correlation analysis showed no significant correlation between the three indicators for GHG emissions reduction, their scatterplots reveal quite similar scatter pattern. Their aggregated values indicate relatively strong linear relationship at the higher end of the scores for the natural capital protection. In all cases, the linear aggregation of the normalized indicators allowed for compensability between the indicators, improving the relationship to the natural capital protection.   3.4 Data analysis 3.4.1 Normalization and benchmarking Indicators with different measurement units such as presented in Fig. 1  cannot be used for aggregation. Normalization offers a mechanism to transform them into the same unit with the objective of facilitating comparison across not only the indicators but also the years and countries. Rescaling method, also known as min-max transformation, was used to normalize the indicators in the Green Growth Index for the following reasons: (i) simple and the most widely used method; (ii) can integrate upper and lower bounds; and (iii) allows application of sustainability targets in the method. Equation (2)  presents a more general mathematical function of the rescaling method to include information on lower bound a   and upper bound b  .Equation 2 X i n o r m   = a + ( x i  − X m i n    X m a x   − X m i n      )  ( b − a  )      where: a = lower bound.b = upper bound    The above equation yielded normalized indicators with values between 1 and 100. The lower bound was necessary to avoid getting the lowest score of zero, which could be misinterpreted as incapability of a country to perform in a given indicator. The lower bound was thus fixed at 1. The upper bound was used to integrate the sustainability targets for each indicator (Table 4  ). A value of 100 was used to imply achievement of the sustainability target for a given indicator. By integrating the targets into the rescaling method, the distance to sustainability targets can be directly measured from the scores of the indicators, or benchmarking. The criteria for selecting the sustainability targets are based on the following (Acosta et al., 2019a : p.40):i. For SDG indicators, SDG targets, both explicit and implicit, which were suggested in the OECD OECD (2019) and Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) (Lafortune et al., 2018 ; Sachs et al., 2019 , 2018 ) reports were used. If the interpretation of implicit targets is different, the SDSN values, which are applied on a global context, were adopted.  ii. For non-SDG indicators, targets suggested in scientific literature and reports from international organizations were used.  iii. For SDG indicators not included in the OECD and SDSN reports, the mean of the top five performers was used.  iv. For non-SDG indicators with no available information from the literature and reports, the mean of the top five performers was used.    Criterion (iv) was based on the approach from SDSN's Sustainable Development Report, which presents the SDG Index and Dashboards (Lafortune et al., 2018 ; Sachs et al., 2019 , 2018 ). The reference year for the SDG targets is 2030. However, the reference year for the share of marine biodiversity is 2020. There are already many countries that attained the 2030 target for the SDG indicators (Table 4 ). The results of the normalization and benchmarking are presented in section 4.1  and Appendix D  (see supplementary material).  3.4.2 Aggregation of indicators and scores To generate scores for the pillars and dimension for natural capital protection, the normalized indicators were aggregated at two levels. At level 1, the normalized indicators were linearly aggregated using the arithmetic mean to generate scores for the four pillars of natural capital protection. Linear aggregation was used because it allows full compensability between indicators in each pillar. Thus, the countries with poor performance in one indicator can be compensated by another indicator. There are cases wherein the correlation level is significant between the indicators in each pillar, meaning they have degree of substitution. At level 2, geometric mean was used to the scores of the pillars because it only allows partial compensability. Both levels allow a missing value. There is no aggregation and no score generated if a country lacks data for more than one normalized indicator or pillar. Results from aggregating the normalized indicators (level 1) and pillar scores (level 2) are presented in section 4.2 .  3.4.3 Monte Carlo analysis To check the sensitivity of the scores to the changes in data inputs, i.e. values of the indicators, Monte Carlo analysis was conducted on data, which were changed using ±20% interval. The simulated data were run over 10,000 times and the resulting average value for each country was computed. Results from the analysis are presented in section 4.3 .    4 Results and discussion 4.1 Performance in green growth indicators Fig. 5   presents a dashboard visualizing the performance on indicators for natural capital protection in five regions – Africa, Asia, the Americas, Europe, and Oceania. Among the four pillars, environmental quality shows the best performance, particularly for PM2.5 air pollution (EQ1) and DALY rate as affected by unsafe water sources (EQ2). All regions showed very high performance in these indicators, except for Africa and, for the PM2.5 air pollution, Asia. The relatively lower score for PM2.5 air pollution was due to the very low performance in Qatar and Saudi Arabia. The “Gulf region is one of the most polluted in the world”, with these two Arab countries recording the highest level of air pollution due not only to their desert climate but also to their dependence on oil and gas production and lenient standards and regulations on fossil emissions (Malek, 2020 ). Although Africa performs the least in reducing PM2.5 air pollution and DALY rate due to unsafe water sources, the region has a very high level of performance in terms of MSW generation per capita (EQ3). However, with the increasing urban growth in African cities, there is a likelihood that MSW generation may increase. The current critical problem, however, is the burning of waste due to lack of waste management services, contributing to a high level of air pollution (van Niekerk and Weghmann, 2019 ) and unsafe water resources and sanitation (Aryampa et al., 2019 ). These contribute to only moderate performance on PM2.5 air pollution (EQ1) and the DALY rate due to unsafe water sources (EQ2) in the region. After environmental quality, the next pillar with the best performance across regions is the GHG emissions reduction. Unlike the former pillar, however, the level of performance for the latter pillar is mostly only high and not very high. The regions with a very high level of performance are Africa for ratio of CO2  emissions to population, excluding AFOLU (GE1), and Oceania for both ratios of CO2  and non-CO2  emissions to population, excluding AFOLU (GE1 and GE2). Except for South Africa, which is the world's 12th largest CO2  emitters (Wolpe and Reddy, 2015 ), the African region contributes the least to global warming due to the lowest CO2  emissions in both absolute and per capita terms (Sy, 2016 ). Unlike South Africa, many African countries have poor access to electricity and energy contributing to their low emissions (Menzies, 2019 ). Meanwhile, South Africa is largely dependent on coal for its electricity generation and it has very energy-intensive industrial and mining sectors (Wolpe and Reddy, 2015 ). With respect to non-CO2  emissions from the non-agriculture sector (GE2), Oceania outperforms the other region due to the very high level of performance mainly in the Pacific Islands. Like other Small Island Developing States, Pacific Islands contribute little to GHG emissions but are showing leadership in climate mitigation (Mcleod et al., 2019 ). Overall, performance in non-CO2  emissions per capita in agriculture (GE3) is relatively lower than the other two GHG emissions indicators. Per capita emission from agriculture is slightly higher in Asia emissions than in other regions. But in terms of absolute emissions, Asia contributes the largest to agricultural emissions, about 43% in the 2010s, particularly from rice cultivation (Tubiello, 2019 ). The region has also the largest share of the global population of 7.71 billion, about 60% in 2019 (Our World in Data, 2019 ). The indicators for biodiversity and ecosystem protection, particularly for KBAs and soil biodiversity, show the poorest performance among all the pillars for natural capital protection. Only Europe has high performance in KBAs covered by protected areas and all other regions have only low to moderate performance. Europe has more protected areas than any other regions in the world, albeit they are mostly of the small size of less than a thousand hectares (BISE , n.d.). The 2015 Mid-term Review of the European Union's (EU) Biodiversity Strategy showed progress in many biodiversity areas, although it was emphasized that the efforts are still short of achieving the Member States commitments (IUCN, 2020 ). A recent study revealed, however, that the size of protected areas is not a strong predictor of biodiversity (Hoffmann et al., 2018 ). As such, it is imperative to understand that in this case, the consideration of protected areas support the ecosystem protection component and in part the biodiversity indicator component. On the other hand, increasing evidence shows limitations of reducing biodiversity loss in marine protected areas from recreational use and fishery (Mazaris et al., 2019 ). With respect to soil biodiversity, the Americas and Oceania show high performance with scores of about 76 and 61, respectively (Appendix D , provided as supplementary material). Soil biodiversity has been affected by soil depletion due to direct intensive land use (e.g. intensive farming, mismanagement) and indirect side effects (i.e. soil pollution, deforestation) from human-induced climate change (Geisen et al., 2019 ; Sylvain and Wall, 2011 ). Soil biodiversity is particularly at risk in drylands and degraded lands, which are found in many African and Asian countries. Intensive farming is widespread in many European countries. EU's Common Agricultural Policy, for example, is criticized for promoting intensive farming and ineffectiveness in restoring biodiversity (Harvey, 2019 ). In the Americas (but mainly LAC countries) and Oceania, intensive farming is not at the level found in many industrial countries in Europe and North America. Finally, performance in the share of forest areas is from high to very high in most regions except for Asia. Despite being an important biodiversity hotspot covering about 15% of the world's tropical forests, Southeast Asia is the “world's major deforestation hotspots” (Estoque et al., 2019 : p.2). Performance in indicators for cultural and social value is also generally low but less divergent than for biodiversity and ecosystem protection. The lowest performers in this pillar are Oceania for both Red List Index and share of terrestrial and marine protected areas, and Africa for tourism and recreation in coastal and marine areas. It is well-known that Oceania has significantly loss its species diversity due to habitat loss and degradation, invasive species, disease, overexploitation, climate change, and pollution from urban, agriculture, and industry (Jupiter et al., 2014 ; Kingsford et al., 2009 ; SPREP, 2016 ). It is the “continent of biological extinctions” and has the “highest rate of endangered species” globally (Payri and Vidal, 2019 ). Terrestrial and marine habitat loss can be best addressed through “designation and implementation of well-managed protected areas” (Jupiter et al., 2014 : p.214). Unlike other regions where conservation is guided by legal laws (e.g. protected areas), in Oceania resource management is linked to a large network of informal and ad-hoc community stewardship (Acosta et al., 2018 ), which in part may have contributed to the low performance of Oceania in the abovementioned pillars. While using community-based resource management is feasible to achieve SDG and Aichi Targets on protected areas, financing and distributing costs and benefits are a challenge. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Regional Assessment for Asia-Pacific reveals that Oceania did not achieve overall progress not only in reducing habitat loss, pollution, and pressure on vulnerable ecosystems but also in increasing financial resources to enhance implementation of resource management (Acosta et al., 2018 ), which is imperative in operationalizing natural resource management at various levels. For the indicator of tourism and recreation, Africa has untapped potential to develop “blue economy” sectors including coastal and marine tourism considering its 38 coastal and island states (Rustomjee, 2018 ). Except for Mauritius and Seychelles, Africa's young tourism sector is challenged by a lack of infrastructure and security (Signé, 2018 ). The tourism sector is at risk from peace and order conditions such as the experience in Comoros and Guinea-Bissau, where tourism collapse after coups and civil war (UNECA, 2014 ). But given the potential of tourism, most African countries have already developed strategic plans for the sector (Signé, 2018 ).  4.2 Distance to sustainability targets Fig. 6   presents the scatterplots of the country scores for the pillars of natural capital protection by region. On the one hand, the scores for environmental quality and GHG emissions reduction tend to gather around the middle and upper range and, on the other hand, those for biodiversity and ecosystem protection as well as cultural and social value are spread from very low to upper range. Moreover, while country scores for cultural and social value range from very low to upper range only for the regions of Africa and Oceania, those for biodiversity and ecosystem protection are spread across all the range for all the regions. This implies that, among all four green growth pillars, achieving sustainability targets for biodiversity and ecosystem protection is the most challenging for many countries across all regions. The challenges are particularly evident in Asia where the largest number of countries have very low scores for this pillar. In contrast, no country in Oceania has low or very low scores for biodiversity and ecosystem protection. The other interesting results from the scatterplots are the presence of country scores that are totally divergent from the regional pattern (Fig. 6 ). The most evident is the country scores for environmental quality and GHG emissions reduction in Oceania. For environmental quality, all country scores are very high in Oceania, except for Guam. The reason for the comparatively lower score for Guam is the low performance in material waste generation per capita of only 39.02 (Appendix D , provided as supplementary material). The small island country is the world's 7th largest producer of solid wastes, generating 4.4 pounds per capita per day and recycling only about 21% of the 311.95 million pounds wastes (George, 2019 ). The waste-management strategy should include both reductions in wastes and an increase in recycling to remedy the crisis (Golabi et al., 2014 ). In the case of GHG emissions reduction, country scores in Oceania also tend to gather on the very-high level range but with one distinct score on the very low level. This country is Australia with one of the lowest performances in non-CO2  emissions from all sectors including agriculture (i.e. GE2 and GE3). Combined with its low performance for CO2  emissions reduction, Australia turned out to have the world's lowest score for per capita GHG emissions. The abolition of the carbon price in 2014 contributed to the annual increase in Australia's national emissions (Morton, 2019 ). Australia is not only a large consumer but also a major exporter of fossil fuels like coal and gas. Moreover, because Australia has the lowest population (0.3% share to global population based on the United Nations population data in 2018), it becomes one of the largest “per capita” emitters among the largest global GHG emitters (i.e. United States, Germany, China, Brazil, and India). Recent estimation shows that Australia will continue to have the highest per-capita emitter in the group of largest global GHG emitters in 2030 (Meinshausen and Ryan Alexander, 2017 ). With the increasingly hot summers due to climate change, consumer demand from fossil-fuel generated electricity increased to operate air conditions and cooling systems (Davidson, 2019 ). But emissions reduction in the electricity sector by 1.2% have already been observed due to increased wind and solar power (Cox et al., 2019 ). In addition to reducing dependence on fossil fuels, investing in these renewable energy sectors will help the country meet its national obligations to the global climate agreement. GHG emissions from agriculture, which contributes 13% of Australia's national emissions, have also been decreasing since 2005 mainly due to droughts (Bourne et al., 2018 ; Cox et al., 2019 ; Paul, 2019 ). Fig. 7   presents the average distance to sustainability targets (i.e. 100) of different sub-regions with respect to their overall performance on natural capital protection. Across sub-regions, distances to targets are still significant, with a gap of at least 20 points. MENA is farthest to the targets with gaps in sustainability targets as high as 57.73 and 51.18, respectively. The MENA region is rich in natural resources, holding about half of the world's oil and gas reserves, respectively (Carrère et al., 2012 ; Tagliapietra, 2019 ). MENA countries thus heavily rely on these fossil fuels for their energy use and exports. But freshwater and agricultural land are naturally scarce in the region. Not only its availability, which is only 1% of available freshwater globally, but also its quality has been affected by population growth, intensified agricultural and industrial developments, and urbanization (Kandeel, 2019a ). A large number of MENA's population (over 60%) live in highly water-stressed areas (FAO, 2018b ). Cereals, which require large amounts of water, are planted in 65% of the cropland (OECD and FAO, 2018 ). The sustainability of freshwater supply will be further aggravated by the impacts of climate change and competition over its use within and outside the region (Kandeel, 2019b ). But several MENA countries have made progress in integrating approaches to manage and govern their natural resources – energy, water, and land (Hoff et al., 2019 ). The Middle East countries, in particular, are among the global frontrunners in decarbonizing energy production and developing renewable energy (Broom, 2019 ), for example, making a world record in solar prices include Saudi Arabia (7.8 USD/MWh), Abu Dhabi (24.2 USD/MWh) and Dubai (29.9 USD/MWh) (IRENA, 2019 ). Middle East countries are making enormous investments in renewable energy, creating “important opportunity to diversify countries' energy mixes” (Anderson, 2019 ). The United Arab Emirates is investing its considerable oil revenues into renewable energy (Broom, 2019 ). These policy initiatives will contribute to improving the region's performance in natural capital protection.  4.3 Sensitivity to input changes The results of the Monte Carlo analysis show that the effect of changing indicator values caused an acceptable level of changes in the scores of natural capital protection. For each observation, 10,000 samples were randomly created by varying the input variables in their uncertainty range that was assumed to be ±20%. The mean and variance of the resulting response variable were calculated for 198 countries. An estimated mean for all observations along with their 95% confidence interval is illustrated in Fig. 8  . It shows a quite stable pattern across countries, with confidence intervals slightly increasing as the scores decrease. This applies, for example, to countries like Palestine (PSE), Afghanistan (AFG), Virgin Islands US (VIR) with higher variability in the estimated mean compared to other countries. These countries have scores below the middle range where the scores have ample space to change. In contrast, country scores of the indicators, which are mostly gathered at the higher end of the range (as shown in the scatterplots in Fig. 6 ) and where there is limited space to further increase the scores, have lower variability. Overall, however, due to the large sample size, the estimated mean approximates the baseline value of the Green Growth Index, i.e. the sample means are tightly clustered around the baseline value. Moreover, in order to identify the shift in the position of the countries, the difference on the rank of the countries between baseline and the estimated mean was calculated. About 75% of the countries kept their position and had no change in the rank, and about 9% of them shifted the position only by one place. Four countries including Belgium (BEL), Guatemala (GTM), Northern Mariana Islands (MNP), and the United States of America (USA) changed the position by two places. Only one country, Virgin Islands US (VIR), had the change in rank by four places. When interpreting the ranks, it should be considered that the shift in the position is always relative to the ranks of the other countries. These results suggest that the methods applied to generate scores for natural capital protection and its pillars are quite robust.   5 Conclusions The article discusses the performance in achieving sustainability targets in natural capital protection in countries across five regions – Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. The performance is measured based on the indicators, pillars, and dimensions relevant to green growth. The natural capital protection consists of 12 indicators, which are aggregated to form three pillars including environmental quality, GHG emissions reduction, biodiversity and ecosystem protection, and cultural and social value. The indicators are either from the SDG indicators or directly contributing to SDG and other sustainability targets (e.g. Aichi Biodiversity, Paris Climate Agreement). Natural capital protection is one of the four dimensions in the Green Growth Index and framed to link to other green growth dimensions including efficient and sustainable resource use, green economic opportunities, and social inclusion. Natural capital is core to green growth because of its role in providing an enabling environment to achieve green growth and its sustainability targets – i.e. as sources of renewable resources, new economic growth, and social well-being. The results revealed that performance across the four pillars of natural capital protection are divergent. On the one hand, regions are performing better in environmental quality and GHG emissions reduction, and on the other hand, struggling to improve the low performance in biodiversity and ecosystem protection as well as cultural and social value. For many regions, particularly Asia and Oceania, the challenges of improving performance in the share of KBAs covered by protected areas and soil biodiversity are enormous. In addition to climate change, biodiversity loss is a critical global issue that threatens the sustainability of economic growth and human well-being. The main driving factor for biodiversity loss in many countries is deforestation. For example, Southeast Asia, which is one of the world's biodiversity hotspot, is the world's major deforestation hotspot. In other regions, intensive farming is an important cause of biodiversity loss. If biodiversity loss due to deforestation and intensive farming will continue, the countries will lose the ability to achieve sustainability targets in reducing GHG emissions and environmental quality. The largest gap to the target is Australia's score for per capita GHG emissions reduction. There are, however, decreasing trends in emissions from Australia's agriculture and electricity sectors which will help contribute to narrow this gap in the future. In particular, significant investments in renewable energy will help Australia further reduce its GHG emissions. Because the results presented in this article measure performance on indicators that not only contribute to SDGs but are also benchmarked against sustainability targets (i.e. SDGs, Aichi Biodiversity, Paris Climate Agreement) they provide an assessment of the countries' and regions’ ability to achieve their commitments in international agreements. Overall, with the highest global score of only about 80, the distance to sustainability targets for natural capital protection is still far away (i.e. target score is 100). Efforts are still needed to achieve the SDGs for the natural capital protection. The MENA region is the farthest to the target with scores of about 55. The challenges for this region are twofold – first, reducing emissions from its rich natural resources such as oil and gas, and second, reducing unsustainable use of its scarce natural resources such as freshwater and cropland. Addressing these problems requires efficient and sustainable use of natural resources as well as investments in renewable energy. Significant progress in the latter is evident in many countries in the Middle East.

Appendix D Supplementary data The following is the Supplementary data to this article:Multimedia component 1 Multimedia component 1      Appendix D Supplementary data Supplementary data to this article can be found online at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indic.2020.100069 .  Appendix A Description of the indicators for natural capital protection PM2.5 air pollution, mean annual population-weighted exposure  Unit: micrograms per cubic meter   Indicator category / code:  Environmental quality / EQ1  Related SDG:  Target 11.6, indicator 11.6.2 (as of June 2019)  Data availability:  Time series, 1990–2016  Data source:  Brauer, M. et al. 2016, for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016, World Health Organization  Online source: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.PM25.MC.M3   Impact on green growth:  Negative  Definition:  The mean annual population-weighted exposure to PM2.5 measures the average exposure level of a population to the concentration of PM2.5, which penetrates deep into the human respiratory system and therefore severely damages human health. The exposure level is computed by weighting the mean annual PM2.5 concentration by urban and rural population. (WB, 2019)  Relevance:  According to the World Health Organization, PM has harmful effects on human health. PM2.5 is the most commonly used indicator for estimating the effects on mortality. In fact, it ranked as the fifth mortality risk factor in 2015 (Van der Gon et al., n.d. ). Moreover, exposure to chronic PM2.5 over a period of one year or more causes around 95 percent of the 3 million deaths globally per year. Thus, prediction of exposure to it is a good indicator for the overall impacts of air pollution on health (Tessum et al., 2017 ).  Limitation(s):  The indicator calculates air pollution using satellite data but using urban populations as denominator factor, which can be defined differently according to the country. Furthermore, consultations with countries can lead to adjustments and bias on the data. Data quality varies between high-, low-, and middle-income countries. (UNSTATS metadata )        Age-standardized disability-adjusted life years (DALY) rate as affected by unsafe water sources  Unit: DALY lost per 100,000 persons   Indicator category / code:  Environmental quality / EQ2  Related SDG:  Target 3.9, indicator 3.9.2  Data availability:  Time series, 2000–2017  Data source:  Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation  Online source: http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool   Impact on green growth:  Negative  Definition:  The disability-adjusted life years (DALY) is the only indicator in health that measures diseases consisting of the total number of years of life lost and the number of years lived with disability. (Kim et al., 2018 )  Relevance:  Clean water access is important for the environment, human development, and economic growth. More than 2 billion people across the globe, however, do not have access to safe water resources (EPI, 2018 ). Urban construction and economic development increase sewage discharges and harshly damages the reservoir environment. The need for safe water has increased because living standards have also improved (Qing et al., 2014 ). In developing countries, diarrheal disease caused by poor drinking water quality is one of the most common contributors to the disease burden as measured by disability-adjusted life years. Thus, safe water resources play an important role in maintaining human welfare and health (Hunter et al., 2010 ).  Limitation(s):  The data on deaths are not up-to-date in all countries as there are not always reliable registration systems, leading to discrepancies between countries and the need to complete the data using other sources. (UNSTATS metadata )        Municipal solid waste (MSW) generation per capita  Unit: Tons per year per capita   Indicator category / code:  environmental Quality / EQ3  Related SDG:  Not in the list of SDG indicators, but contributes to knowledge on Target 11.6, Indicator 11.6.1  Data availability:  2018  Data source:  World Bank What a Waste database  Online source: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/what-waste-global-database   Impact on green growth:  Negative  Definition:  Municipal solid waste is defined as the household waste and other waste generated in the same nature by industrial and agricultural areas, business or commercial establishments, and public spaces (UNSTATS metadata ). The per capita municipal solid waste is an environmental indicator that measures the intensity of generating waste over time (Kawai & Tasaki, 2016 ).  Relevance:  The overload amount of solid wastes from domestic activities of humans disposed in the municipality has caused numerous negative impacts to humans and ecosystem (Azodo and Ismaila, 2016 ). Also, economic growth, consumption patterns, and the degree of industrialization are related to the amount of solid wastes generated. Solid wastes are a by-product of urban growth. The growth of population in urban areas results in more municipal solid wastes. Additionally, if there is a lack of technology and efficient methods to dispose of wastes, air quality will deteriorate, thus adversely affecting human health (Tahir et al., 2015 ).  Limitation(s):  In many developing countries, municipal solid waste collection and treatment is done through the informal sector. Data on adequate treatment of municipal waste is limited. Furthermore, even if data collection is done correctly, interpretation of what makes municipal waste treatment, for instance, recycling, composting, adequacy of collected data varies greatly from country to country. This leads to limitations in data unification. (UNSTATS metadata )        Ratio of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions to population, excluding AFOLU  Unit: Metric tons per capita   Indicator category / code:  GHG emissions reduction / GE1  Related SDG:  Not in the list of SDG indicators but relevant to Goal 13 on Climate action  Data availability:  Time series, 1960–2014  Data source:  Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, Environmental Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Tennessee, United States.  Online source: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC?view&equals;chart   Impact on green growth:  Negative  Definition:  CO2  is a greenhouse gas that is odorless, colorless, and nonpoisonous. It is formed through carbon combustion and respiration of living things (UNFCCC, n.d. ). The indicator is based on emissions ensuing from burning fossil fuels and manufacturing cement, including those produced during the consumption of solid, liquid, and gas fuels and gas flaring (WB, 2019).       Relevance:  In 2012, carbon dioxide accounts for around three-quarters of total greenhouse gas emissions (Ritchie and Roser, 2018 ). In China, the total carbon emissions in the cities relate closely to the country’s GDP. But per unit area carbon emissions are strongly related with population density in cities (Wang et al., 2012 ). It is suggested that a more useful indicator for measuring impacts on climate is carbon emissions per capita (The Guardian, 2016 ).  Limitation(s):  Different calculation methods and energy sector disaggregation methodologies have caused some discrepancies on estimates of CO2  emissions among countries. (UNSTATS metadata )        Ratio of non-CO2  emissions (CH4 , N2 O) to population, excluding AFOLU  Unit: Tons per capita   Indicator category / code:  GHG emissions reduction / GE2  Related SDG:  Not in the list of SDG indicators but relevant to Goal 13 on Climate action  Data availability:  1990–2010  Data source:  FAOSTAT data for both GHG emissions and population  Online source: https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions   Impact on green growth:  Negative  Definition:  Methane and nitrous oxide are also sources of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for around 17 percent and 7 percent of emissions, respectively. In terms of sectors, agriculture and energy contribute about 90 percent of global methane emissions, while agriculture accounts for more than 60 percent of nitrous oxide emissions. Due to the importance of the latter type of emissions, nitrous oxide emissions were included as separate indicator (see GE3 below). (Ritchie and Roser, 2018 )  Relevance:  Non-CO2  greenhouse gases also contribute to climate change. It is, however, not related to cumulative emissions but determined through annual emissions. Thus, it is important to account independently the additional warming from the non-CO2  agents when CO2  emissions compatible with temperature limit is estimated (Friedlingstein et al., 2014 ).  Limitation(s):  The EDGAR database uses a bottom-up approach to determine GHG emissions from country statistics. This method is robust for countries with strong statistical data infrastructure but less so for countries with a weak data measurement and reporting body. (Janssens-Maenhout, et al. 2017 )        Ratio of non-CO2  emissions (CH4 , N2 O) agriculture to population  Unit: Gigagrams per 1,000 persons   Indicator category / code:  GHG emissions reduction / GE3  Related SDG:  Not in the list of SDG indicators but relevant to Goal 13 on Climate action  Data availability:  1961–2016  Data source:  FAO for emissions, WB for population  Online source: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/GL ; https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL   Impact on green growth:  Negative  Definition:  Greenhouse gas emitted from the agricultural sector include non-CO2  gases, such as methane (CH4 ) and nitrous oxide (N2 O). Livestock and crop production and management generate these gases. (FAO, 2018 )  Relevance:  Activities related to agriculture, forestry, and other land uses (AFOLU) generate greenhouse gases through removals by sinks. They comprise CO2  and non-CO2  emissions from forestry and other land uses and non-CO2  from agriculture. AFOLU represents almost 25 percent of greenhouse gas emissions globally. Next to the energy sector, AFOLU is the second largest emitting sector. Action in AFOLU is important to many countries where the sector represents a huge part of their economy, is at risk of climate change, and can greatly benefit from climate funding for GHG reduction, food security, and rural development (Tubiello et al., 2014 ).  Limitation(s):  The indicator for emissions from agriculture is constructed using the Tier 1 IPCC methodology. Using higher tier data modelling would reduce the uncertainty by 10 percent to 20 percent. (Tubiello et al., 2013 )        Average proportion of terrestrial, freshwater, marine, and mountain key biodiversity areas (KBAs) covered by protected areas  Unit: Percentage   Indicator category / code:  Biodiversity and ecosystem protection / BE1  Related SDG:  Target 14.5, indicator 14.5.1; Target 15.1, indicator 15.1.2; Target 15.4, indicator 15.4.1  Data availability:  2000–2018  Data source:  BirdLife International, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC (2018)  Online source: https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/   Impact on green growth:  Positive  Definition:  The indicator is the proportion of main biodiversity areas, whether terrestrial, freshwater, marine, and mountain, covered by protected areas. These areas significantly affect biodiversity preservation globally. Protecting these key ecosystems improves biodiversity and sustains the use of natural resources. (UNSTATS metadata )  Relevance:  As humans encroach on the natural systems, adverse impacts on the terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems also increase. Establishing protected areas has become a major strategy to conserve biodiversity. Well-managed protected areas provide healthy ecosystems and benefits even to humans. These benefits include ecosystem services, such as food security, disaster risk reduction, and clean water (Bertzky et al., 2012 ). Moreover, integrating establishment of protected areas in land use plans can address issues relating to species loss and climate change adaptation (Lopoukhine et al., 2012 ).  Limitation(s):  This indicator does not include how the effectiveness of establishing protected areas in protecting biodiversity and ecosystems, which depends on enforcement and appropriate management. Regarding key biodiversity areas, the list is not complete in all regions, and there are some omissions. (UNSTATS metadata )        Share of forest area to total land area  Unit: Percentage   Indicator category / code:  Biodiversity and ecosystem protection / BE2  Related SDG:  Target 15.1, indicator 15.1.1  Data availability:  1990–2016  Data source:  FAO, electronic files and web site http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/EL   Online source: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.FRST.ZS ;  Impact on green growth:  Positive  Definition:  Forest area is a land with trees with a minimum of five meters in situ. It does not include trees in agricultural areas, such as fruit plantations and agroforestry, and in gardens and parks (WB, 2019). Forest area is important for human as it provides goods, such as nonwood and wood forest products, and services, such as carbon sequestration, coastal protection, soil preservation, water conservation, and biodiversity habitat. (UNSTATS metadata )  Relevance:  Forestry can help conserve natural resources and contribute to their sustainable growth through protecting water resources and enhancing biodiversity. The forestry sector can contribute to green growth through instituting policies on climate change. IT can help expand renewable energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Generally, forests contribute to green building and infrastructure and acts as carbon sinks (United Nations, 2009 ).  Limitation(s):  Forest surveys are conducted at irregular intervals from country to country. Remote sensing can be used but cannot detect long-term tree growth or low canopy cover density forests. The indicator is used to measure the extent of forest preserved and restored but only partially measures the extent of forests that are managed sustainably. (UNSTATS metadata )        Soil biodiversity, or the potential level of diversity living in soils  Unit: Index   Indicator category / code:  Biodiversity and ecosystem protection / BE3  Related SDG:  Not in the list of SDG indicators but provides important contribution to SDG indicator 15.3.1  Data availability:  2016  Data source:  Joint Research Centre, European Soil Data Centre (ESDAC)  Online source: https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/content/global-soil-biodiversity-maps-0   Impact on green growth:  Positive  Definition:  This indicator is based on the soil biodiversity map with an index showing the level of diversity living in soils. Data include the distribution of soil microbial diversity and soil fauna diversity. (Serna-Chavez et al., 2013 )  Relevance:  Soil biodiversity reflects the diversity of living organisms in soils. These organisms interact with different animals and plants in the ecosystem. Moreover, these organisms contribute important services for sustainable ecosystem. They regulate organic matter dynamics, greenhouse gas emissions, and carbon sequestration in soils. Also, they enhance the efficiency of acquiring nutrients and plant health. (El-Hage Scialabba, n.d. ).  Limitation(s):  This indicator uses measurements that uniformly made one meter underground. This is sometimes underneath the organic ground layer and in the sedimentary layer, meaning it does not account completely for soil biodiversity. (Serna-Chavez et al., 2013 ).        Red List Index  Unit: Index   Indicator category / code:  Cultural and social value / CV1  Related SDG:  Target 15.5, indicator 15.5.1  Data availability:  1993–2016  Data source:  BirdLife International and IUCN (2018)  Online source: https://www.sdg.org/datasets/indicator-15-5-1-red-list-index/data   Impact on green growth:  Positive; an upward trend means that the expected rate of species extinctions decreases  Definition:  The Red List Index, which ranges from 0 to 1, measures the variation in the total extinction across species groups. It is based on the variation in the total number of species in every type of extinction risk based on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. A value of 1 means the species is of least concern for extinction; a value of 0 means the species is extinct. The index shows how far the species groups have moved toward extinction. Therefore, it can be used to compare species groups in terms of extinction risk level and the rate that such a risk changes. (UNSTATS metadata )  Relevance:  There is still a significant number of species threatened by extinction despite different conservation efforts. Contributing factors include habitat destruction, pollution, overexploitation, and introduction of exotic species. To boost conservation efforts, many countries have been using the IUCN Red List. The list is a commonly used system to assess the risk of and quantify threats to a species to go extinct (Kideghesho, 2009 ). Species that are highly valued are considered cultural indicators and critical when planning restoration and rehabilitation projects with local communities (Harmsworth et al., 2011 ).  Limitation(s):  The Red List Index includes several sources of uncertainty. Species can be inadequately qualified as to their endangered status, and there can be inconsistency in assessing species. Some species are also too poorly known to be Included in the Red List’s data.  (UNSTATS metadata )        Tourism and recreation in coastal and marine areas  Unit: Scores, 1–100   Indicator category / code:  Cultural and social value / CV2  Related SDG:  Not in the list of SDG indicators but contributes to SDG target 12.B, which is to develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable tourism  Data availability:  2014–2017  Data source:  Ocean Health Index  Online source: http://data.oceanhealthindex.org/home   Impact on green growth:  Positive  Definition:  Tourism in coastal and marine areas contributes to economic growth. The indicator on tourism and recreation represents the cultural experiences of visitors in coastal and marine attractions. This indicator only represents participation in coastal tourism. The Ocean Health Index measures the economic aspects of coastal and marine attractions in Coastal Livelihoods and Economies goal. (OHI, 2019 )  Relevance:  Ecotourism promotes responsible tourism in natural areas, improves the well-being of local communities, and contributes to conserving the environment (Zambrano et al., 2010 ). Determining the symbolic species depends on the existence of that species, and that its value for a particular cultural area increases when it is rare and its habitat is inaccessible (Schirpke et al., 2018 ).  Limitation(s):  The model used for this index is the study of participation rates in 19 marine-related activities per capita. Thus, a wide range of marine activities are not included (Halpern et al. 2014 )        Share of terrestrial and marine protected areas to total territorial areas  Unit: Percentage   Indicator category / code:  Cultural and social Value / CV3  Related SDG:  Target 14.5, indicator 14.5.1, and contributes to Target 15.1  Data availability:  2016, 2017  Data source:  World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA), whose compilation and management is carried out by the United Nations Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) in collaboration with governments, non-governmental organizations, academia, and industry.  Online source: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ER.PTD.TOTL.ZS ; https://www.protectedplanet.net/   Impact on green growth:  Positive  Definition:  Terrestrial protected areas are at least 1,000 hectares of completely or partially protected areas designated by the national government as nature reserves, national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, natural monuments, and protected landscapes. Protected areas also include scientific areas that cannot be publicly accessed and areas that are managed sustainably. Marine protected areas are subtidal or intertidal land, overlying water, and associated fauna and flora preserved by law. It also includes the cultural and historical characteristics of the area. (WB, 2019)  Relevance:  Planning for tourism areas consider the environment and people in protected areas. A tourism planning and development strategy normally takes into account aspects such as adequate zoning, safeguarding guidelines, regulations, and proper management (Yamauchi and Lee, 1999 ).  Limitation(s):  The indicator excludes sites protected under local or provincial law (WB, 2019)         Appendix B Correlation between indicators of natural capital protection Image 1      Appendix C Scatterplots of the indicators of natural capital protection.
