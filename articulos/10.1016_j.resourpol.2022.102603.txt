                  We investigate whether research and development (R&D) and environmental knowledge spillovers aid economies in meeting the targets of the United Nations’ (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns (SDG12). We do so by utilizing panel data from the European Union, Japan, and USA over the period of 2002–2017 and a production function approach. The results show that whereas R&D, in general, works against meeting the targets set in SDG12, environmental knowledge spillovers facilitate achieving the goal. Additionally, and as expected, the results support the positive effect of control of corruption and resource scarcity but a negative impact of environmental policy stringency for SDG12. The latter result might be due to environmental policies facilitating end-of-the-pipe solutions rather than supporting decreased resource and material use and waste generation. The findings indicate that instead of just supporting all (green and dirty) R&D, policymakers should devise measures that specifically facilitate environmental innovation (not just “any innovation”) and knowledge spillovers stemming from such green technologies, to support sustainable development via innovation.

The findings indicate that instead of just supporting all (green and dirty) R&D, policymakers should devise measures that specifically facilitate environmental innovation (not just “any innovation”) and knowledge spillovers stemming from such green technologies, to support sustainable development via innovation.   Keywords Environmental innovation  Knowledge spillovers  Patents  Research and development  Sustainable development goals  SDG12    1 Introduction Incentivizing economic growth at the expense of the nature today compromises the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Therefore, international organizations and countries have adopted measures for promoting and supporting sustainable development that considers our limited natural resources. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set up by the United Nations (UN) are a milestone in this work. The twelfth goal of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDG12) concerns ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns. For meeting the targets set in SDG12 countries are expected to minimize their waste generation and use of natural resources (i.e., their material footprint) and improve their resource efficiency. SDG12 is closely linked to Target 4 of SDG8 (“Decent work and economic growth”) to improve resource efficiency in consumption and production (United Nations, 2021 ). Meeting the targets set in SDG12 requires changes in environmental policies, adopting sustainable lifestyles, re-cycling, novel ways of doing things, green technologies, and environmental innovation. In this paper, we are particularly interested in the impact of the latter in helping economies to meet the targets set in SDG12, since earlier literature has underlined the importance of environmental innovation in adhering to new more stringent environmental regulations and standards devised to promote sustainable development (Brunnermeier and Cohen, 2003 ; Makkonen and Inkinen, 2018 ). The standard definition given for product and process innovation – when measuring the occurrence, sources, and impacts of innovation – is a new or improved product or process that is brought to the market (i.e., commercialization or implementation) and whose technological characteristics are significantly different from existing products or processes in the market (Statistics Finland, 2021 ). As is well-known, there are several other types of innovation and more complex definitions for innovation but here we utilize the above “empirically friendly” definition as the basis for our empirical investigation since it fits well with our chosen indicators (such as patents) to measure knowledge spillovers stemming from innovation. Environmental innovation has also been defined in various ways depending on the source and purpose (Guo et al., 2020 ). For our purposes, we utilize one of the commonly accepted examples of distinguishing environmental innovation: namely, the definition of environmental innovation by the European Commission's Eco-Innovation Action Plan (European Commission, 2011 ) as “any innovation that makes progress towards the goal of sustainable development by reducing impacts on the environment, increasing resilience to environmental pressures or using natural resources more efficiently and responsibly”. While, it is widely accepted by scholar, industry professionals and policymakers that innovation is a key driver for meeting the SDGs (Silvestre and Ţîrcă, 2019 ; Wang et al., 2021 ), many contemporary environmental (green, sustainable, eco-) innovation have been criticized as technological end-of-the-pipe solutions that are not really fixing the problem of unsustainable development but rather just mitigating the impacts of it (Frondel et al., 2007 ). However, environmental innovation is commonly associated with lucrative business opportunities: there are real incentives for firms to invest on research and development (R&D) work directed towards environmental goals. Therefore, environmental innovation has been seen as a sort of a “win-win” solution bringing profits for the firms introducing environmental innovation and at the same time benefitting, at large, the sustainable development of the economy, the environment, and the society (Carrillo-Hermosilla et al., 2009 ; Makkonen and Inkinen, 2021 ). At the same time, the importance of knowledge spillovers has been underlined as decisive in the development of environmental innovation (Aldieri et al., 2020a ): knowledge spillovers from external sources have been deemed to positively affect firm-level innovation processes (Montoro‐Sánchez et al., 2011 ; Arvanitis et al., 2020 ; Rodríguez et al., 2022 ). Knowledge spillovers are commonly defined as the “external benefits of creating knowledge accumulated by others than the creator” (Agarwal et al., 2010 : p. 271). That is, they relate to the capture, integration, and utilization of external knowledge sources (knowledge generated outside the investigated unit such as a firm or a region) into one's own innovation processes (Aldieri et al., 2020b ). In this paper we are specifically interested in knowledge spillovers stemming from environmental innovation (termed here as “environmental knowledge spillovers”). Despite the growing interest towards the topic, there are still knowledge gaps and lack of empirical evidence concerning the impact of environmental innovation and particularly the role that knowledge spillovers stemming from such green technologies play in meeting the goals set in the SDGs (Aldieri and Vinci, 2020 ). We contribute to this literature by focusing on a specific sustainable development goal, namely SDG12. That is, in this paper we investigate the role of R&D and environmental knowledge spillovers (see Aldieri et al., 2019  for a recent literature review on the topic) in facilitating resource efficiency through commonly used metrics in monitoring the progress towards meeting the targets set in SDG12. That is, we utilize R&D, patent, and environmental data to show whether R&D and environmental knowledge spillovers lead to improved resource efficiency, waste intensity and material footprint with panel data from 2002 to 2017 covering three of the major economic areas of the world: the European Union (EU), Japan and the United States of America (USA). Furthermore, we test whether other commonly identified factors – namely, control of corruption, environmental policy stringency and resource scarcity – affect the results. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: First, a literature review section summarizes the most relevant literature discussing the measurement of environmental innovation and knowledge spillovers followed by an overview of the existing empirical literature on the topic leading to suppositions tested in the empirical part of the paper. Second, the theory behind the empirical approach is presented. Third, the material (data) and methods (calculations) utilized in this paper are introduced. Fourth, the most relevant results of the analyses are laid out and discussed vis-à-vis  the existing literature (suppositions). A summary of the main results, derived conclusions, policy implications and limitations (paving the way for further research) concludes the paper.  2 Literature review 2.1 Measuring environmental knowledge spillovers There are two commonly utilized indicators for measuring knowledge spillovers: 1) patent citations (Jaffe et al., 1993 ) and 2) R&D statistics (Fritsch and Franke, 2004 ). Patent citations help to track and observe knowledge spillovers from one invention to another, whereas R&D statistics allow to explicitly track the inputs of knowledge development (Henderson, 2007 ). Galdeano-Gómez and Céspedes-Lorente (2008)  have noted that most studies connect knowledge spillovers with R&D stock and link them to the transfer of environmental knowledge. In this paper, we are also interested in this latter perspective and utilize R&D stock as our measure for knowledge spillovers. However, we go one step further and utilize information depicting environmental innovation to weight the R&D stock (explained in greater detail in Section 3.2 ) for specifically investigating environmental knowledge spillovers rather than knowledge spillovers in general. For measuring innovation, we utilize patent data. There are several shortcomings for utilizing patent data for measuring innovation: for example, not all patents are introduced into the market, not all innovation are patentable, the economic value of patents varies enormously, there are sectoral differences in patenting activity, etc. (Archibugi and Pianta, 1996 ; Mazdeh et al., 2021 ). However, the unavailability of other potentially more accurate innovation metrics – such as innovation counts data gathered with the literature-based innovation output method (Torregrosa-Hetland et al., 2019 ) – for cross-country comparisons hinder their utility for empirical purposes. As such – and in line with earlier literature (Acs et al., 2002 ; Oltra et al., 2010 ; Makkonen and van der Have, 2013 ) – while acknowledging their limitations, we utilize patents as a reasonable proxy measure for product and process innovation. While the same limitations as above apply to the measurement of environmental innovation with patent data, for practical reasons (mainly data availability) patents are among the most utilized proxy measures for environmental innovation (Johnstone et al., 2010 ; Su and Moaniba, 2017 ; Aldieri et al., 2020b ). However, when it comes to measuring environmental innovation an even more pressing question remains: How to distinguish between environmental and non-environmental patents? For this end, we utilize the green patent codes reported in Marin and Lotti (2017)  deemed relevant for environmentally sound technologies. Their list of green patent codes is based on expert opinion by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). While they acknowledge that, on the one hand, the included set of codes might be too broad (i.e., include non-environmental innovation), they also underline that, on the other hand, their extensive list of codes overcomes the risk of labelling environmental innovation into the “non-environmental” category. They further argue that, since the number of environmental patents is much smaller contra the non-environmental ones, the decision serves the purposes of statistical analyses (a statement that we agree with). Therefore, these green patent codes are utilized in generating our environmental knowledge spillovers variable (explained in greater detail in Section 3.2 ).  2.2 Environmental knowledge spillovers and sustainable development goal 12: suppositions The literature on environmental innovation is inherently tied to the so-called green growth vs. degrowth debate (Sandberg et al., 2019 ). Therefore, there are several studies discussing whether environmental innovation and knowledge spillovers can positively affect both sustainable development and economic growth. While the “jury is still out for the final verdict”, there are evidence showing that environmental innovation do not just facilitate economic growth but can also promote SDGs and green growth (Sohag et al., 2019 ; Khan and Ulucak, 2020 ; Omri, 2020 ; Fernandes et al., 2021 ). In this paper, we concentrate on investigating their potential environmental, rather than economic, benefits. Recent discussions and empirical evidence based on national level EU data on R&D expenditure as a share of GDP has linked R&D to positive environmental outcomes (Campanolo et al., 2018 ; Adedoyin et al., 2020 ). Specifically, in relation to resource efficiency, material footprint and waste intensity, Yurdakul and Kazan (2020)  have shown – using survey data on Turkish manufacturing firms – that environmental innovation has a direct effect on resource saving and recycling. The analysis by Wendler (2019)  – using patent data for the EU countries – has indicated that innovation in general had no significant effect on resource efficiency. This applies also to innovation principally depicted as “green”. Only when dividing the environmental innovation data into more specific classes such technological areas as recycling and reuse were shown to reduce material usage. Therefore, not just any innovation will lead to resource efficiency: the innovation needs to be directed towards it. In fact, as evidenced by Cainelli et al. (2020)  – using a cross-sectional dataset of EU firms – R&D, in general (i.e., directed at both dirty and clean technologies) does not sustain environmental innovation aimed at resource efficiency. That is, as it is quite probable that a high share of R&D is directed at developing dirty technologies (Aldieri et al., 2020a ), general investments in R&D do not automatically lead to environmentally desirable outcomes. Rather, innovation activities need to be directed towards environmental goals (i.e., environmental innovation) for them to have a positive effect on minimizing waste generation and the use of natural resources and improving resource efficiency. Therefore, we test the following contradictory suppositions:Supposition 1 R&D, in general, facilitates meeting the goals set in SDG12.  Supposition 2 R&D, in general, does not facilitate meeting the goals set in SDG12. As stated in the Introduction (Section 1 ), relatively few academic works have been carried out to investigate the relationship between knowledge spillovers and SDGs. However, some related notable exceptions do exist. The results by Aldieri et al. (2020a)  – based on patent data on 240 large firms from the EU, Japan, and USA – underline the importance of knowledge spillovers when developing environmental innovation. Similar work on climate change and carbon emissions has further underlined the important role that knowledge spillovers play in the process of decreasing carbon emissions and at the same time improving firms’ productivity (Aldieri and Vinci, 2020 ; Anser et al., 2020 ), while Guzel et al. (2021)  have discussed the beneficial impact of knowledge spillovers in meeting the goals set in SDG3 (“Good health and well-being”). Even failed innovation activities can lead to knowledge spillover, as learning about negative research findings helps others in directing R&D resources more efficiently (Fleming-Muñoz et al., 2020 ). Thus, in this paper we also focus on the connection between knowledge spillovers and SDGs but specify it to relate to knowledge spillovers stemming from environmental innovation (environmental knowledge spillovers) and test the following supposition:  Supposition 3 Environmental knowledge spillovers facilitate meeting the goals set in SDG12. Ever since the seminal hypothesis by Porter (1991) , suggesting that more stringent environmental legislation will induce innovation which in turn will positively affect firm performance, the rationale behind environmental innovation has been discussed to stem both from sustainability but also from economic reasons. Earlier literature – for example, the study by Lin and Zhu (2019)  based on Chinese provincial data – has shown that innovation processes respond actively to pressing sustainability concerns by producing green technologies mitigating pollution or waste generation when there are markets (customer demand) for such products. This has been further evidenced by the results of Liao et al. (2018)  – based on content analysis of annual reports of 120 Chinese firms – and Liao and Liu (2020)  – based on meta-analysis. As suggested by Porter and van der Linde (1995) , these markets are commonly induced by increased environmental policy stringency (see also Aldieri et al., 2020b ; Makkonen and Inkinen, 2021 ). However, according to the “waste haven” (or alternatively “pollution haven”) hypothesis and empirical evidence – for example, the results by Dou and Han (2019)  based on Chinese provincial data – mobile polluting industries have tended to transfer their production to countries or regions with less stringent environmental regulations and standards (see also Davis et al., 2019 ; Gyamfi et al., 2021 ). Thus, increasing the stringency of environmental regulations in one country can lead to environmental deterioration in another country with less strict environmental standards. Both the Porter and waste haven hypotheses are still controversial: there are several previous studies either supporting or refuting them (see e.g., Rubashkina et al., 2015 ; Zheng and Shi, 2017 ; Shao et al., 2019 ; Wang et al., 2019 ). Moreover, while it is certain that the benefits of environmental innovation will accrue to future generations, uncertainty about future environmental regulations leads to uncertainty of the potential economic value and longevity of environmental innovation hindering the zeal to invest resources in developing them (Fleming-Muñoz et al., 2020 ). These notions coupled with the statement expressed in the Introduction (Section 1 ) that many of the environmental innovation, induced by environmental regulations and standards, are end-of-the-pipe solutions mitigating environmental impacts but not necessarily contributing to increased resource efficiency leads us to test the following contradictory suppositions:  Supposition 4 Environmental policy stringency facilitates meeting the goals set in SDG12.  Supposition 5 Environmental policy stringency does not facilitate meeting the goals set in SDG12. The harmful impacts of corruption on the economy are well established (Marchini et al., 2020 ). Therefore, it is not surprising that corruption it also commonly stated to distort sustainable development (Owusa et al., 2020 ). In fact, for example the study by Leal and Marquques (2021)  using data from 23 African countries has underlined that stricter regulation to reduce corruption would mitigate environmental degradation by restricting the relocation of polluting industries. Thus, “the reduction of corruption is considered one of the most important steps to pave the way for sustainable development” (Mugellini and Villeneuve, 2019 : p. 202). Based on this discussion we test the following supposition:  Supposition 6 Controlling corruption facilitates meeting the goals set in SDG12. For the operationalization of environmental policy stringency and control of corruption see Section 3.2 . Finally, the scarcity of resources can induce the demand for environmental innovation: the abundance of existing natural resources works against sustainable development (Pata et al., 2021 ) as it extrudes investment in environmental innovation (Cheng et al., 2020 ). From the economic areas investigated here, Japan is clearly an example of an economy with scarce natural resources, whereas in the EU and USA there are (more) abundant natural resources. Thus, although earlier studies have shown that large Japanese manufacturing firms do consider SDG12 among the most important sustainable development goals (Ike et al., 2019 ), it is important to note that Japan is an extreme case due to its postindustrial economic structure and dependence on imports for final consumption (Wiedmann et al., 2015 ). Thus, we test the following supposition:  Supposition 7 Economic areas with scarce natural resources meet the goals set in SDG12 better than economic areas with abundant natural resources.     3 Theory, material and methods 3.1 Theory To evidence the theoretical foundation motivating the potential impact of R&D and environmental knowledge spillovers on sustainable development, we consider a model – applied also in earlier papers by the same authors (see e.g., Aldieri et al., 2020b ) – in line with the environmental economics approach (Perman et al., 2011 ) where we can assume a production function of country i :(1) Y i  = f i  ( L i  ,  K i  ,  R & D , W i  ( [ R i  ]  )  ,  A [ ∑ j  W j  ]  , S P [ ∑ j  R & D j   ]   )      where L = labor; K = capital; R&D = R&D capital; W = waste generated from the use of resources R; A = measures the quality of environment. Additionally, SP = spillovers, derived from the weighted sum of external R&D investments, as described in Section 3.2 . The following properties can be assumed:(2) δ Y i  / δ L i  > 0 ; δ Y i  / δ K T i   > 0 ; δ Y i  / δ W i  > 0     (3) δ W i  / δ R i  > 0 ;  δ Y i  / δ A < 0 ;  δ Y i  / δ S P < o r > 0      Therefore, if a country uses more resources to improve their growth level it will lead to higher output but also to higher waste generation that may, further, spillover to other countries through negative externalities. There are, however, also knowledge spillovers that are expected to positively affect the innovation processes for sustainable development. Thus, in this paper, we are particularly interested in investigating the extent to which R&D and environmental knowledge spillovers can affect SDG12 proxied by waste intensity, resource efficiency and material footprint. Therefore, from the above equation, we can derive the following function:(4) A = f ( L i  ,  K ,  R & D ,  S P , Z i  )      where Z indicates other variables relative to the socio-economic features of the country.  3.2 Data All data were collected for 2002–2017 (2017 being the most recent year with full data coverage for the variables and economic areas investigate in this paper). The data covers three of the major economic areas of the world: the EU, Japan, and USA. For descriptive statistics see Table 1  . Parts of the data utilized in this paper have been compiled for the purposes of earlier papers by the same authors (see e.g., Aldieri et al., 2020b ). This data combines firm-level data on inputs and outputs with data on patents registered by each firm in the data. Firm-level data have been sourced from the European Commission's Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard  (European Commission, 2017 ) including: net sales (Y), annual R&D expenditure (R), number of employees (L), annual capital expenditure (C) and the industrial sector the firm belongs to (measured at two-digit level). The monetary values, reported in Euros, have been reconverted into their original currency and then converted back to Euros using the exchange rate from 2007 (our reference year). R and C were used to construct a measure of R&D stock (R&D) and physical capital (K) stock by using the perpetual inventory method and, in line with earlier literature (Hall and Mairesse, 1995 ; Aldieri, 2011 ), a depreciation rate of 0.15. Finally, after applying the cleaning procedures introduced in Aldieri et al. (2018)  the final sample consists of an unbalanced panel of 825 large firms active in sectors related to waste, energy, and water resources. Patent data have been sourced from the OECD REGPAT database  (see Maraut et al., 2008 ) in December 2017 including: the technical field of the patent and the patent holder (individual or a company). The information on the patent holder allowed us to match the patent data to the individual firms in the Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard (see Aldieri and Vinci, 2016 ). Knowledge spillovers are typically measured as the stock of R&D conducted outside the focal firm and weighted by an appropriate measure of closeness (or distance) between the source and the recipient of the spillovers (Griliches, 1992 ). For this end, we used the Jaffe (1986)  measure to compute the uncentered correlation coefficient between the corresponding technology vectors (based on the distribution of the patents):(5) J i j   = ∑  k = 1  K  V i k   V j k    ∑  k = 1  K  T i k  2  ∑  k = 1  K  T j k  2         where Vi  = the technological vector of the firm i,  k = 1, ...K stands for patent technological sectors and Jij  = the technological proximity between firm i  and j . Similar to Aldieri et al. (2018 , 2020b) , the weighted stock of spillovers are calculated as:(6) S P i  = ∑ i ≠ j   J i j   R & D j       where R&Dj  = the R&D capital stock relative to company j . In our case, environmental knowledge spillovers (SP) are based on the green patent codes reported in (Marin and Lotti, 2017 ). In particular, the patents are defined as ‘green’ when their technological sector refers to production processes sensitive to greater environmental sustainability. Additionally, we utilize the same firm–country matched measures as in (Aldieri et al., 2020b ) to consider the potential impacts of environmental policy stringency by employing the Environmental Policy Stringency Index (EPSI) as well as information on “control of corruption” (CC) gathered from the Quality of Government database  (Quality of Government Institute, 2021 ). To evaluate the connection between R&D and environmental knowledge spillovers and SDG12 (and Target 4 of SDG8) we utilize the following commonly applied (see e.g., SDG Tracker, 2021 ; Razzaq et al., 2021 ) monitoring indicators: 1) waste intensity (WI), resource efficiency (RE), and 3) material footprint (MF). WI is calculated as the ratio between waste generation and GDP: the lower the waste generation relative to GDP, the better for the environment. RE is calculated as the ratio between domestic material consumption (DMU) and GDP: the lower the DMU relative to GDP, the better for the environment. That is, RE measures how efficiently natural resources are used relative to GDP. Finally, we utilize data on MF, which is measured as the total amount of raw materials extracted to meet final consumption demands. Again, the lower the MF, the better for the environment. The data were collected from the database of OECD Statistics  (2021) . The variation in WI, RE and MF between the three investigated economic areas are presented in Fig. 1  . As we can observe from the Figure, Japan does significantly better in meeting the targets set in SDG12 compared to the EU and USA. A summary of the research design is described in Fig. 2  . The selection of our data sources and the rationale behind data calculations was based on data availability and supported by earlier studies utilizing similar data (Moncada-Paternò-Castello et al., 2010 ; Aldieri and Vinci, 2016 ; Aldieri et al., 2020b ).  3.3 Model specification tests In order to identify the most opportune model specification, we implemented the Hausman (1978)  test to differentiate between fixed effects and random effects models. The test verifies whether there is correlation between the unique errors and the regressors in the model. The null hypothesis is that there is no correlation between the two supporting the use of a random effects model. Based on the results (Table 2  ), the hypothesis that the individual-level effects (in our panel data) are adequately modeled by a random effects model is rejected. Thus, we will estimate a fixed-effects model in the subsequent sections. Moreover, we performed the Wald test for heteroskedasticity: based on the results (Table 3  ), the homoskedasticity hypothesis is rejected. Thus, we will estimate a fixed-effects model with robust standard errors in the subsequent sections.  3.4 Calculation For the empirical part of this paper, and in line with the recent literature on green growth (Fernandes et al., 2021 ), we consider the lagged explanatory variables to deal with the simultaneity problem and estimate three equations to evaluate the impact of innovation processes on WI, RE, and MF (as the dependent variables):(7) ln ( W I )  i t   = β 1   ln ( Y )  i t − 1   + β 2  ln ( L )  i t − 1   + β 3  ln ( K )  i t − 1   + β 4  ln ( R & D )  i t − 1   + β 5  ln ( S P )  i t − 1   + β 6  ln ( E P S I )  i t − k   + β 7  ln ( C C )  i t − 1   + α i  + μ t  + ε i t       (8) ln ( R E )  i t   = β 1   ln ( Y )  i t − 1   + β 2  ln ( L )  i t − 1   + β 3  ln ( K )  i t − 1   + β 4  ln ( R & D )  i t − 1   + β 5  ln ( S P )  i t − 1   + β 6  ln ( E P S I )  i t − k   + β 7  ln ( C C )  i t − 1   + α i  + μ t  + ε i t       (9) ln ( M F )  i t   = β 1   ln ( Y )  i t − 1   + β 2  ln ( L )  i t − 1   + β 3  ln ( K )  i t − 1   + β 4  ln ( R & D )  i t − 1   + β 5  ln ( S P )  i t − 1   + β 6  ln ( E P S I )  i t − k   + β 7  ln ( C C )  i t − 1   + α i  + μ t  + ε i t          4 Results and discussion Table 4   presents the results obtained using the panel fixed effect model for each dependent variable: WI, RE, and MF. The results are similar regardless of the proxy for measuring the environmental impact: environmental knowledge spillovers enhance environmental quality and, thus, facilitate meeting the targets set in SDG12 as expected based on the literature (Supposition 3 ). The literature supporting a positive link between R&D and SDGs (Supposition 1 ) has mainly utilized country-level (macro) data. Our choice to approach the issue through firm-level (micro) data shows contradictory evidence to these earlier notions of a positive link between (all) R&D and sustainability. Interestingly, based on our data and the chosen production function approach, while investments in physical capital work in favor of the environment, investments in R&D activity work against achieving the targets set in SDG12. This is, as discussed in Section 2.2 , probably caused by a high share of R&D directed at developing “dirty technologies” and in line with the earlier literature presented to support Supposition 2 . Regarding the other variables (Table 4 ), control of corruption seems to display an opportune tool to facilitate meeting the targets set in SDG12 as expected based on earlier research on the topic (Supposition 6 ). The result is statistically significant only between control of corruption and material footprint but considering the small variation in CC between the economic areas investigated (Table 1 ), the result suggests that its importance would be more underlined if our data would have included countries with significantly lower performance in control of corruption. Contrarily, environmental policy stringency does not emerge as effective measures to facilitate meeting the targets set in SDG12 in our estimations refuting Supposition 4 . The latter observation is a rather surprising one when contrasting it to the vast literature supporting the Porter hypothesis. However, it is supported by the waste haven hypothesis and criticism towards end-of-the-pipe solutions (Supposition 5 ). That is, the results might be caused by large companies (to which our data is based on) tending to move their production to countries with less stringent environmental regulations and standards rather than improving their resource efficiency. Thus, increasing environmental policy stringency in a single economy would merely result in relocation to jurisdictions with more relaxed environmental regulations and standards. An alternative explanation is that, while inducing environmental innovation (as suggested by the Porter hypothesis), increased environmental policy stringency is not enough to facilitate the minimization of waste generation and use of natural resources nor improving resource efficiency (i.e., they only stimulate end-of-the-pipe solutions). We also estimated our model by including the interactions between R&D, environmental knowledge spillovers, and country dummies (Table 5  ). The findings show that Japanese firms fare better in complying to SDG12 than their EU or US counterparts. The result is as expected based on earlier studies underlining resource scarcity, that the Japanese economy is an example of (or at least more so than the EU or USA), as a facilitator of sustainable development (Supposition 7 ).  5 Conclusions This paper has concentrated on investigating the relationship between R&D and environmental knowledge spillovers and SDG12 aimed at ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns with R&D, patent, and environmental data from the EU, Japan and USA over the period of 2002–2017. The key result of this paper can be summarized as follows:• While, in general, R&D activity seems to be unfavorable for SDG12, environmental knowledge spillovers facilitate achieving the targets set in SDG12 for ensuring sustainable consumption and production.    Earlier studies (e.g., Adedoyin et al., 2020 ) have drawn positive links between R&D and SDGs but our data and approach would suggest going one step further to meet the goals set in SDG12: if the aim is to facilitate sustainable development via innovation, R&D support should be specifically targeted for developing environmental innovation and facilitating knowledge spillovers from such green technologies, not just “any innovation”, related to, for example, material innovation, the reuse of materials and recycling (see Kassouri et al., 2021 ). This is an important takeaway for policymakers. The results also indicate that control of corruption facilitates meeting the targets set in SDG12 supporting the implementation of measures that, for example, facilitate the reporting of corruption and extent the reach of anti-corruption policies to environmental issues (see López-Cazar et al., 2021 ). For the relationship between environmental policy stringency and SDG12 we get a puzzling result that rather than supporting they actually hinder the goal of ensuring sustainable consumption and production. This seems to indicate that, since increased environmental policy stringency often induces end-of-the-pipe solutions, alternative means are needed for supporting resource efficiency. This postulation is in line with the findings of Cainelli et al. (2020)  who have shown that, while product innovation in recycling and innovation related to the after-use (i.e., end-of-the-pipe solutions) are strongly affected by policy, innovation related to (reducing) material inputs reduction present weaker evidence of being induced by environmental policy stringency. That is, increased environmental policy stringency (alone) does not guarantee better environmental conditions (Long et al., 2013 ) in relation to SDG12. Finally, global regulations and standards are needed to tackle the potential negative effects of the waste haven hypothesis (i.e., the relocation to countries or regions with lower environmental policy stringency). It has to be acknowledged that our paper has several limitations that pave way for further research:1. Our data are rather unevenly matched, since results based on comparing national accounts to a dataset of 825 large firms can only be taken as initial indications. Further, there is naturally a degree of heterogeneity between the EU countries (Karakaya et al., 2021 ), which does not come across in our aggregate study design. Therefore, further research with larger sample sizes is needed to produce more robust findings to corroborate our conclusions. Similar work could be extended to investigate the impact of environmental knowledge spillovers on the targets set in other SDGs.  2. Separating the environmental policy stringency measure according to whether the imposed regulations and standards are directed to mitigate environmental impacts (and thus induce end-of-the-pipe solutions) or to actually minimize the use of resources, would help to better disentangle the results concerning the link between environmental policy stringency and resource efficiency.  3. As we have been able to verify from the estimates, environmental knowledge spillovers play an important role in facilitating meeting the goals set in SDG12. Therefore, technological proximity between companies is relevant also at an international level. However, the methodological procedure adopted in this paper considers a symmetrical measure of proximity that does not account for differences in competitiveness, market conditions nor technological similarity. Future research should adopt indicators (or control variables) that consider this potential asymmetry based on, for example, patent citations (as in Aldieri, 2011 ) or migratory flows of inventors (as in Miguelez and Temgoua, 2020 ) to overcome the limitations of symmetrical proximity measures.  4. Achieving the targets of the SDGs is necessarily a global effort. As such, another weakness of this investigation is that – due to the lack of comparable patent data – it neglects several strategically relevant countries outside the ones investigated here (i.e., EU, Japan, and USA). For example, several large economies, such as Brazil, China, India, and Russia, that have an immense impact on the global environment (see Pata et al., 2021 ) as well as a growing role in global technological development, have a significant bearing on the future of sustainable development. Therefore, future research should conduct (world-wide) comparative analysis that consider the overall global conditions for an efficient ecological transition.    We hope that our results, scoping the environmental knowledge spillovers–SDGs nexus, inspires further research on the topic.  Author statement L.
