                  The purpose of this research is to assess China’s sustainable economic recovery and growth through a comparative analysis of China’s global economy following Covid-19. We use the unit root test and generalized method of moments (GMM) to make inferences. The growth scenario is an important consequence of economic recovery, and the study concludes that increased energy use and rising energy costs need greater funding for the energy industry. Green energy financing is urgently required to offset rising production costs of gas and electricity. It is recommended that both Chinese and global financial institutions, banks and finance ministries, take a prominent role in addressing the crisis. This can be achieved by investing in renewable energy to improve sustainable economic recovery, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and accelerate economic recovery. This must be carried out over a long period to achieve the intended results. Strategic development goals (SDGs), such as SDG 7 on clean and cheap energy, and SDG 13 on combating climate change, are urged on all nations in both areas.

The purpose of this research is to assess China’s sustainable economic recovery and growth through a comparative analysis of China’s global economy following Covid-19. We use the unit root test and generalized method of moments (GMM) to make inferences. The growth scenario is an important consequence of economic recovery, and the study concludes that increased energy use and rising energy costs need greater funding for the energy industry. Green energy financing is urgently required to offset rising production costs of gas and electricity. It is recommended that both Chinese and global financial institutions, banks and finance ministries, take a prominent role in addressing the crisis. This can be achieved by investing in renewable energy to improve sustainable economic recovery, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and accelerate economic recovery. This must be carried out over a long period to achieve the intended results. Strategic development goals (SDGs), such as SDG 7 on clean and cheap energy, and SDG 13 on combating climate change, are urged on all nations in both areas.   Keywords Green finance  Sustainable economic recovery  Growth scenarios  COVID-19  China    1 Introduction This research is driven by stable growth requirements which acknowledge environmental resource limitations and other systemic problems, such as energy prices and the technological progress needed for improved corporate governance. According to Wildman (2021) , environmental problems have specific impacts on a products (goods or services), processes (work practices), systems (mechanisms), and organizational change, all of which unintentionally influence the world through comparable technologies (Mohsin et al., 2021, 2020 ). Renewable technologies are added to the natural process but serve as a private and public resource. Green finance, however, covers all kinds of technologies which concentrate on environmental issues and seek to be sustainable (Mohsin et al., 2022a,b ). Green innovation, carbon-neutrality, and green funding have all emerged as key challenges for the emerging seven (E7) economies in recent years, with increasing levels of resource-intensive and carbon-based growth (Sun H. ping et al., 2019; Tiep et al., 2021 ). In contrast, many developing countries are carbon-intensive, which can be inferred from two estimations revealing substantial increases in the supply of primary energy in the United States, Japan, and other countries across the globe (Sun et al., 2020a; Baloch et al., 2020 ). The population of developing nations grew by 36% (from 2.9 billion to 4.0 billion) between 2000 and 2015, with nearly 1.3 billion more projected in the future. There is a huge impact on global food security as both the population and economic impact of Asia continues to grow. Many nations, particularly those in the early phases of development, face a significant risk of loss of habitat variety and global warming. With these population forecasts, Asia needs to increase its low-carbon energy sources to achieve its environmental mitigation aims (Sun et al., 2020b,?,a ). However, there are creative methods of bridging the growing financial gaps which require new and unorthodox approaches (Alemzero et al., 2020b; Sun et al., 2020; Alemzero et al., 2020a ). Forty-five nations have claimed $3.6 billion in climate-friendly infrastructure financing shortfalls from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The United Nations Conference on Trade and Growth (UNCT) and the South-East Asian Nations Association (ASEAN) both believe that, over the next 5 years, Asia will require $110 billion in infrastructure investment. For these issues to be addressed locally, a thorough study of green finance and emissions is required. Innovation in environmentally friendly processes is one option for investigation (Li et al., 2021 ). Governments in many countries encourage companies to generate renewable energy and motivate the public to use the energy generated from renewable sources, because of environmental sustainability concerns (Li et al., 2021; Chien et al., 2021; Iqbal et al., 2021; Sadiq et al., 2022 ). According to the UN’s environmental programme, the greatest contribution to renewable energy technology over the 2010–2019 period has been in solar photovoltaic (PV), at 633 GW, a 27 times increase. Onshore wind has increased by 458 GW, while offshore wind increased by 29 GW over the same period. Biomass energy and trash almost doubled, contributing 62 GW. More moderate increases have been seen in other methods of production. While renewables are now firmly integrated into energy production, they make up only 26.3% of the total electricity generated, and just 12.9% excluding hydroelectricity. At the same time, there is no access to power for 1.1 billion people (Agyekum et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021 ). Renewable energy has the potential to change the global energy sector and provide splendid investment opportunities, as the market is anticipated to reach $2.1 trillion by 2025. Renewables have a bright future for investors, which both practice and research have to take into account. Buildings represent 40% of Europe’s energy consumption. Non-residential buildings, of various kinds, including hotels, account for 25% of the total energy consumption in Europe, and are therefore significant contributors to energy prices. The average energy consumption of non-residential buildings is 40% more than residential buildings (286 kWh/m2  vs. 185 kWh/m2 ) (Iqbal et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021 ). Building energy use varies by nation in the European Union (EU). Climatic conditions, architectural features (e.g., building envelopes, degrees of isolation), and social and cultural variables (lifestyles, habits, etc.) may explain these differences. Non-residential energy consumption may be affected by economic development and job expansion. Energy efficiency (EE) offers a possibility of significantly reducing fuel consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and operating expenses in the service sector. Several studies analyse possible energy savings, reduced energy prices, and EE investment profitability. However, despite the substantial monetary and environmental advantages, the levels of EE adoption are usually modest, as the EE gap shows. To overcome this EE gap and promote more effective purchasing, a deeper knowledge of the obstacles to major expenditure, such as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems, is essential (Zhang et al., 2021; Hsu et al., 2021; Ehsanullah et al., 2021 ). Studies investigating the obstacles in the hotel sector and successful policies for energy development offer valuable information. The Chinese economy offers a highly interesting case study, owing to the substantial energy consumption of tourism in the country. The broad range of climate and type of establishment in the hotel industry provides an opportunity to explore the use of sustainable economic recovery measures, providing insight for other states where tourism is an important part of the economy. As the United States grew, it confronted many challenges, such as natural capital abuse, significant environmental waste, and ecological damage. Climate protection and carbon neutrality promotion are major issues around the globe. Green finance and carbon neutrality are emphasized by the 2019 Strategy of the State Council (Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino, 2019, 2020; Taghizadeh-Hesary and Taghizadeh-Hesary, 2020; Taghizadeh-Hesary et al., 2021 ). Innovation in the green process allows both carbon neutrality and green funding to be optimized in China and other global economies, a win–win situation. Due to the growth scenario and the associated support structure, researchers explore the connection between carbon neutrality regulations and green funding. The support system for carbon neutrality has declined considerably due to innovation in carbon optimization which may lead to externalities in the economy. Government control is necessary to address this issue (Albulescu, 2020 ). Several studies state that laws supporting the Porter theory of green innovation should be implemented, via green funding for carbon neutrality. For this type of innovation, green finance is essential to combat the green corporate research and development (R&D) capital deficit based on possible risks and uncertainties. To minimize the effects of environmental pollution, governments implement environmental controls. Naturally, this is intended to remove pollutants affecting the public. Governments also offer financial incentives for businesses to undertake R&D into green technology to optimize the innovation process. Environmental development and green financial aid would be severely obstructed without such laws. We thus submit several questions. If increasing financing for growth impacts energy prices, does this favour new green financing or existing green financing techniques? What kind of green financing offers a greater growth scenario and can better serve to determine energy prices? This research sheds insight on the relationship between energy policy and green financing and provides important information about developing markets and market-oriented energy price-related activities.  2 Literature review New incentives for the green sector, such as green company taxes or government loans, frequently lead to new inventions. This study focuses on government support for public initiatives. Many studies have been conducted on the impact of public financing on the development of environmental technology in the private sector, and there are no limits to the variation in opinion about whether government support to companies slows this development (Cervellati et al., 2019 ). Government funding has a positive impact on green business. Green engineering reacts to threats and opportunities unexpectedly. Companies can gain economically by creating incentives to reduce risk and encourage additional R&D activities, which have a positive effect (Alemzero et al., 2020a ). Researchers find that government R&D subsidies stimulate entrepreneurial growth and drive innovation, evidence for the idea that various efforts affect one another (Malik and Umar, 2019 ). Alternatively, incentives have been shown to damage renewable technology corporations, with R&D subsidies provided mostly not to those who need them, but to those who cannot otherwise afford them (Alles et al., 2021 ). Government incentives, therefore, slow the mechanism. Although traditional research may overstate the impact of government subsidies by 30% to 50%, it is responsible for under 10% of sales. To improve the efficiency of engineers and scientists, authorities may fund or subsidize R&D activities (Ozturk and Cavdar, 2021 ). Increased spending on R&D reduces corporate innovation. Previous research studies concentrating on small enterprises in the US, show that R&D subsidies drown out Ireland’s industrial sector, and serve as a benchmark for government financing for R&D. It concludes that government-funded initiatives at the national level complement R&D. A US panel analysis from 1997–2009 uses the probability density regression method and reports on the effect of R&D spending on R&D investment in various quantities (Sun et al., 2020 ). Other than this US study, government subsidies are shown to restrict business R&D spending. A three-year study of US government R&D data (from 2003 to 2004) concludes that it impairs productivity and provides no support for innovation. When a business is financed by the government and spends money on programmes rather than purchasing, it can make up for a financial deficit. Moreover, new technologies and equipment may be introduced, existing technologies can be converted, and present equipment can improve its processes. Studies reveal evidence in favour of neutrality of employment energy use, known as the impartiality hypothesis. One reason that the empirical results on the connection between energy consumption and economic development are different, and sometimes contradictory, is the various methodologies used in the analyses. Many studies use basic log–linear models estimated using ordinary lesser squares (OLS) without considering the characteristics of the time series of the variables involved. However, as has been recently shown, most economic time series are non-stationary (Richter et al., 2021 ). Thus, failing to consider these characteristics may lead to false connections between the variables. Following the time series analysis progress over the past decade, new energy intake growth tests have been developed using bivariate causality methods based on earlier tests. However, these tests may not identify other causation pathways and lead to contradictory findings. In recent research, for instance, the causality between power consumption and GDP for South Korea and Singapore is evaluated using the Granger standard test and integration and error correction. Green technology innovation has garnered constant attention from the corporate sector due to increasing environmental concerns. It is, in fact, vital that manufacturing companies, particularly in highly polluting industrial sectors, take responsibility for environmental protection (Vavrek and Chovancová, 2019 ). Companies should also consider the requirements of customers and social responsibility and the advantages of adapting their operations to preserve the environment. Pollution may, in some ways, be seen as evidence of the inefficient use of resources, which impacts the profitability of businesses. New technology is credited with addressing environmental issues via pollution mitigation (Jin et al., 2021 ). Green innovation is important for addressing environmental problems. Sustainable development is essential to enhance competitiveness, a win–win approach, enabling businesses to achieve and maintain competitive advantage via pioneering green innovation initiatives. According to Jinjarak et al. (2021) , adopting green practice is good for financial performance and sustainability for small and medium-sized companies (Karpinska and Śmiech, 2020 ). Development in green technologies is anticipated to provide a double dividend, reducing the strain on the environment while contributing to economic and technological modernization (Li et al., 2019 ). Specific requirements must be fulfilled for green technology innovation to function successfully. Firstly, it has to be founded on new technical knowledge, and secondly, it needs to be already in place (i.e., new products must have already been introduced to the market or new processes must have already been introduced in firms). Many factories have begun to adopt process-oriented, environmentally-friendly methods. The problem is that green technology innovation involves great uncertainty due to the so-called dual externality problem (Yang et al., 2020 ). Firstly, it takes time to realize the possible positive impact of green innovation on a company’s financial performance. Secondly, the transformation of green technology innovations into financial benefits relies on many biological causes (Wu et al., 2020 ). Since innovation failure has become a subject of growing importance, particularly for highly polluting sectors, it is worth examining the variables that influence the investment rewards of companies using green methods. Creativity in green technologies involves two main strategies, green process innovation and green product creativity. Green product innovation seeks to alter or change product design via non-toxic chemicals or biopolymers throughout the manufacturing process to decrease the environmental effect of disposal and increase sustainable economic recovery. Innovative green products need a new perspective on the product lifecycle, from production to distribution, use, disposal, and recycling — in other words, a “cradle to grave” approach (Kahouli and Okushima, 2021 ). In particular, green product innovation concerns enhancing product durability or recyclability, reducing raw materials, selecting ecologically healthier raw resources, and eliminating dangerous components. Meanwhile, innovation in green processes aims to decrease energy consumption during manufacturing, and transform waste into valuable items (López-González et al., 2019 ). In particular, green process innovation involves decreasing air and water emissions, reducing water use, increasing resources and sustainable economic recovery, and transitioning from fossil fuels to bioenergy. Companies which pioneer green technology may thus gain and maintain competitive advantages (Ozcan and Ozturk, 2019 ). The creativity of a company’s processes is strongly related to its product innovation. We argue that the growth scenario of a company is, for many reasons, linked to its green product innovation. Firstly, technology in green procedures requires systematic improvements to the overall operational process to improve resource efficiency, which can promote green product design and production while laying the foundations for innovation in green products. Studies indicate that the growth scenario may assist companies in succeeding in creating new green goods by establishing competitive advantage for green products. Secondly, process innovation enables companies to enhance their product quality, and expand their product range.  3 Methodology 3.1 Study variable measurement Committee studies are used to assess research variables, starting with model expectations to test environmental and government subsidy regulations. Considering that progress in green innovation is a consequence of progressive accumulation, the model accounts for the lag in innovation in the first order. Energy prices typically have a non-linear effect on green processes. As atmosphere management is key, the model includes the quadratic term (Shahbaz et al., 2017 ). We use the following complex model: (1) l n E P  i t   = α + β  1   G P I + β  2   G F s + c X  i t   + ɛ  i t       where i represents each province; t represents time (2009–2017); a is the intercept term; b and c are the coefficients to be estimated; ɛ   is the random disturbance term; lnGPI is green process innovation; lnGPSIit-1 is the first-order lag item of green process innovation; ER is environmental regulation; GFs is green financing in the form of government subsidy, and X represents the control variable. Lastly, as a matter of reality, the procedure is extended to each threshold (Thaler, 2017 ). This builds a panel model to determine whether there is a clear connection between government legislation on climate and environmentally friendly development. The artificial partitioning of the period in this analysis allows for a prediction mistake. The panel model uses the single-threshold scheme introduced by Hansen, and combines it with the double-threshold model: (2) l n E P  i t   = α + β  1   G P I  i t   × I ( G F s  i t   ≤ Y  1   )  + β  2   G P I  i t   × I G F s  i t   > Y  2     c X  i t   + ɛ  i t      (3) l n E P  i t   = α + β  1   G P I  i t   × I G F s  i t   ≤ Y  1     + β  2   G P I  i t   × I Y  1   < G F s  i t   ≤ Y  2     + β  3   G P I  i t   × I G F s  i t   > Y  2     c X  i t   + ɛ  i t         where I (⋅  ) is an indicator function; and υ   is the threshold value (see Table 1 ).     3.2 Variable description This study is based on province data at the national level in China from 2009 to 2017 (excluding Tibet, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, because of a lack of data). All information comes from the US Statistical Yearbook, US Environmental Statistics, and Technology Publication. Green Process Innovation:  Environmental law lacks uniformity, and the adequacy of the protection of the environment may be assessed either by a single indicator or various indicators. A good illustration of this comes from Xu et al. (2021) , who add estimates which match the current environmental status of the United States to their industrial theory. Considerations of environmental control evaluate the environmental effect. This analysis is based on Stoian and Iorgulescu (2020)  and the Gao computation, as a stand-in for completed expenditure on carbon emissions management programmes for one year as a temporary replacement for the surrogate proportion of the industrial effluent management projects to the annual gross benefits of technology firms. In various areas, the proportion of public R&D funding is characterized by; the greater the percentage of government assistance, the greater the reduction. Green financing:  Regional laws and government incentives are inconsistent owing to differences across firms, locales, and businesses. To guarantee that certain discrepancies do not influence the results there is a need for comparability. Control variables:  China’s global economy has a large geographical breadth and varied development phases, with a significant impact on green product innovation. Energy costs impact individuals at various phases of economic development. The better the standard of living, the less environmental protection is needed. We use Dobbins et al. ’s (2019 ) research techniques to assess economic development using quadratic terms. For each level of development, we measure economic growth by the total province GDP. Gross domestic product (GDP):  Varying levels of environmental access may lead to estimations that influence activities and beliefs, resulting in disparities which creativity offsets. The trade-to-dollar ratio defines the total quantity of goods imported per province per capita compared to the country’s GDP (10,000 RMB). Various degrees of access to the environment lead to estimations that influence activities and beliefs, leading to disparities which creativity can compensate for. Energy prices:  Energy prices are taken directly for this study. Human capital:  The most important human capital is those involved in creating and disseminating new ideas. The number of hours of R&D undertaken by employees, proportionate to the size of the field, is calculated. Openness to the outside world:  Investment in R&D programmes inside companies is provided through corporate R&D assets. Government assistance is essential for the reorganization and installation of new equipment, but internal resources also have a major impact on operations. The equation is obtained by computing the logarithm of each province’s internal R&D investment.  3.3 Empirical estimation design We apply the Lin, Levin and Chu (LLC) tests to each variable base to ensure our findings are accurate. The data is presented in Table 2 . All the findings in the panel appear to be stationary. The effect of the generalized method of moments (GMM) is more specific: Model 2 and Model 3 are non-linear models; Model 3 is a model of environmental controls and government subsidies and shows a non-linear interaction between the two; Model 1 and Model 4 are a mixture of static and time-series GMM techniques used to approximate the device predictions.   4 Results and discussion 4.1 Empirical estimation of the panel benchmark model This study analyses the impact of green innovation finance methods in environmental policies on reducing carbon emissions. Businesses with a strong emphasis on green processes and a greater legislative severity have the greatest advantage in improving environmental governance. The primary causal variable, green funding of innovation in green processes, impacts the exogenous variable, affecting the phenomena. This model does not consider possible endogeneity, but all other control variables are considered external. We thus use the Durbin–Wu–Hausman (DWH) endogeneity test. If the null hypothesis is rejected, the ER or unsystematic part is probably endogenous, and the OLS estimator is incorrect. The instrumental shape is best used and is supported in the current research. The empirical results show that the null hypothesis of the research is rejected and green finance enhances the capacity to inspire innovation from green processes to reduce carbon emissions. This research uses a generalized method to deal with explanatory factors and residual heteroscedasticity in its estimate. The results show that the P  -value is below 0.05, which shows that the ER is endogenous, with a DWH test result of p < 0.01.99. This research uses GMM estimates to manage heteroscedasticity. Table 3  shows the GMM estimates for Model 1, Model 2, Model 3 and Model 4. The second model shows the non-linear relationship between environment and laws, and the third model analyses the impact of subsidies and regulations on such processes. Random effect panels : Model 1 and Model 4 are dynamic panels. The findings of these models are used as comparisons for results of the GMM fixed effect (see Fig. 1 , and Fig. 2 ). The first order lag-period coefficient in the OLS is 0.41798 compared to the estimated fixed impact coefficient of the model, which is 0.2543.   The last three rows of Table 3  show the association and over-determination checks. The disruption shows autocorrelation rejection (AR), rejecting the null hypothesis while passing the autocorrelation test. Hence, this is a plausible model. Sargan’s t-test indicates that the chosen variables have a P  -value of zero, indicating they may be included in the research as part of a framework GMM model. The lag terms for all the variables approach zero, indicating that the previous green phase has a beneficial effect on the current green growth. This demonstrates sustainable development in a time of continuous growth and confirms the panel logic. In Model 2 and Model 3, the estimates of the first-order coefficients for environmental laws are all negative, while the estimates of the quadratic coefficients are all optimistic. Additionally, green engineering contributes to better environmental legislation. Energy prices have a growing then decreasing effect on green innovation. Environmental laws become a major concern when critical objectives are not met. Once a tipping point is reached, laws that encourage renewable processes and innovation development begin to take effect. This theory is proven to be true.   We may infer that Hypothesis 2 is correct based on the empirical results of the current research. The results show that company size, intellectual resources, and risk funds have an important influence in supporting green processes. Green process development increases by 0.128% at 0.37% on a business level, 0.129% at 0.03% on intellectual resources, and 0.084% in R&D investment (see Fig. 3 ). Overall, green technology advances at the scale of a company are more beneficial, since larger businesses have more financial power, expertise, and resources and are better positioned to adopt new technologies (see Fig. 4  and Table 3 ). Individuals with significant business intelligence resources put their stamp on technological innovation (see Table 2 ). As companies invest in people, they enhance their processes and increase their chances of profitability by using technology. The more they invests in R&D, the more finances for process innovation are accessible.  Early on, renewable technologies could not thrive in a sophisticated economy. However, as economic growth reaches a critical mass, this paradigm is less applicable. Large companies emphasize technological and operational development. As a result, a beneficial relationship between economic development and green innovation flourishes. The degree of integration in Model 2, to the outside world, has a negligible effect on green innovation, which may be due to companies being heavily exposed to capital failure, using existing equipment, and taking on new technology faster. As a result, firms depend on foreign technology and reshuffle their R&D, no longer pursuing green processes. The shift of government decisions, from an obstacle to a benefit, in Model 3 are seen as a change from negative to positive in the coefficient of net transparency (but this is not statistically significant). The financing of government incentives, on the other hand, implies that, when a company’s finances are larger, it encourages innovation and streamlines the production process using new technology. Companies have begun to spend more on R&D. Open-mindedness to external influences is of little use to green creativity.  4.2 Empirical estimation of the panel threshold model The competitive process model focuses only on the impact of policies and subsidies on green process innovation. The strength of green innovation varies depending on the degree of government incentive. To determine the threshold impact, a panel model is constructed. Before the threshold regression, preliminary estimations of the threshold number and value of government subsidies are required to arrive at the final model. This research runs 50,000 bootstrap simulations to approximate the F-value and P  -value and finds a threshold using this bootstrap method. Table 4  contains the defined effects with a single, double, or triple control of the criterion. Model 1, Model 2, and Model 3 are wrong, according to this study. The range of government subsidy is 0.13 to 0.64, as seen in Table 5 . Low and moderate, subsidies can be divided into two categories under this threshold.   The expected coefficients are found and regressed on these variables to generate model predictions. Table 6  shows the relationship between environmental policy and green process development with a threshold effect, which can be used to determine the point at which government subsidies cease to be effective. When SUBS is less than $13.61, the environmental regulation coefficient is insignificant at the 1% level. When incentives are less than $0.1361, the environmental regulation’s importance, at the 1% significance level, is 0.0028.  Environmental regulation affects the adoption of contemporary green processes when subsidies are relatively low. However, when subsidies reach 0.13 or more, environmental regulation becomes a strong technique component (see Table 6 ). Rising government subsidies can achieve environmental policy goals beginning at this threshold. If the government does not raise the quantity of environmental control sufficiently, it is not easy to promote new processes. The other variable estimates are not repeated in this study.  4.3 Discussion This research yields one major finding, environmental constraints have a U-shaped impact, slowing development in the early stages, but promoting it afterwards (Li et al., 2020 ). This result is consistent with Zannin et al. (2018) . However, there are some discrepancies between these findings and those discussed above. Specifically, this study focuses on manufacturing while Haque et al. (2019)  focus on technique and green processes, while others focus on innovation. This study demonstrates that there is a single barrier for environmental laws and economic development when it comes to green government financing for renewable processes. Any government subsidies for green marketing efforts would have minimal effect, given the U-shaped impact of legislation on company greening (Liu et al., 2020 ). Energy prices sustain green technology at their present level of subsidization. These results are consistent with those of Grigoroudis et al. (2019) , but differ from those of Sánchez-Guevara Sánchez et al. (2020) , who argue that energy prices are meant to supplement technology. The findings of this study agree with those of Yao et al. (2019) . The research is limited to green technology, and green product innovation is not considered. We show a link between greater environmental control and better results from technological development. This research looks at 30 Chinese provinces and cities and GMM and threshold data for seven years from 2009 to 2017, to investigate the connection between government laws, green subsidies, climate, and the status of green technology. Environmental legislation may encourage green innovation, but only to a certain extent. The second major purpose of government subsidy is to assist businesses in investing in green innovation, particularly R&D. Thirdly, environmental policy has a U-shaped effect on green technique innovation. It is non-linear because it is well-funded. When government subsidies exceed 0.13, the environment becomes a significant factor in green operations. Considering the relationship between environmental regulation strength and financial subsidies and incentives, environmental regulation is entirely reliant on financial incentives at certain subsidy levels. Finally, there is a U-shaped stage of economic development, which has an inhibitory and then pro-green innovation effect. The results show that the degree of the green process is lower before the turning point of regional economic development. However, as regional economic development accelerates, the green phase must also accelerate. Another important finding is that the government should promote environmentally sustainable building when drafting climate laws, and improve enforcement and monitoring. According to the model results, the intensity of environmental control is 25.135 on the left side of the U-shaped curve for the bulk of the time. The high cost of environmental regulation hampers the green mechanism. Until environmental regulation reaches the inflection point, there is no link between environmental regulation and corporate green process development. As a result, environmental laws need to be tightened. The main aim of environmental strategies should be to improve the depth and range of management to ensure it is competent. Furthermore, since green process advancement is associated with uncertainty and transaction costs, governments can boost R&D subsidies and achieve a significant rise in green process intensity, which can be offset by increased economic power for businesses. R&D expenditure must be raised to bridge the gap between the United States and emerging nations. The government could improve its fiscal administration and eliminate inefficiencies. The government would have to both increase and tailor its R&D subsidies to businesses in response to mounting environmental pressures. Finally, we see endless industrial expansion and the early years of the popular adoption of green methods, which may help businesses improve R&D productivity by expanding their R&D capacity. Environmental concerns must be considered, as long-term sustainability happens simultaneously with economic development.   5 Conclusion and policy implications Although this work contributes to the corpus of knowledge, there are some limitations. Firstly, the sample period is quite short. Over time, certain metrics change, as the US statistics yearbook underwent revisions. Following worldwide agreement on internal expenditure on R&D in the estimates of scientific and technological operations from 2009, the United States abandoned the previous indicators of internal investment in market science and technology activities. Data from yearbooks before 2017 is presently unavailable. Hence this analysis relies on panel data from 2009 to 2017, which is a fairly short period by statistical standards. This means the findings cannot be regarded as conclusive. Further investigation is needed into the validity of the metrics selected. The world’s most populated and fastest-growing E7 countries expect to cut CO2  pollution by 32.7% and other pollutant emissions by 16.5%, but experience greater pressure from global change and its repercussions, by 19.3%. Even though European nations have taken steps to reduce pollution and promote renewable technologies which work in harmony, pollution levels have dropped due to the successful growth scenario in Europe. There is presently no consensus in research circles on factors such as environmental legislation, government benefits, and green process innovation. No other indexes can be tested, since the conditions are too restrictive. Consequently, the variables in this thesis are measured using an index which is often used in academic literature. Finally, this paper does not understate the role of environmental conservation tools in growth scenarios. Market opportunity environmental rules, and shared participation energy pricing are examples of environmental regulations that impose command-and-control authority over the marketplace. Each sort of environmental regulation affects the growth scenario in distinct ways. Consequently, there are few thorough assessments of the impact of government incentives on the development of new environmental regulatory tools. This is an avenue that might be explored in future studies. 1. Numerous energy pricing plans have attempted to combat pollution but increased the amount of GHG produced by human activity. CO2  emissions from fossil fuel burning power plants have increased, despite efforts to reduce energy costs and CO2  pollution.  2. An important goal of productivity measures is reducing GHG emissions from the transportation sector. However, despite significant progress in this area, total oil consumption and vehicle miles travelled are still rising, increasing carbon emissions.  3. Any policy to decrease GHG emissions is simpler to implement than dealing with the implications of rising energy costs. However, only on a global scale can long-term advantages be realized. The benefits of adaptation are greater in the short term than the long or even medium term. This is a source of worry, since it may be advantageous to go back on mitigation pledges. For the time being, it makes economic and social sense to spend less on prevention, but from a global viewpoint, lower energy costs need a more immediate response. Given the local dynamics of political rivalry, voters and taxpayers tend to be financially cautious when supporting programmes that largely benefit other nations.
