                  Climate actions (SDG-13) aim at limiting global warming by targeting carbon emissions reduction. With the energy industry recognized as a significant CO2 emitter, SDG-13 policies mostly translate energy transition to renewables (SDG-7) and the electrification of end-users, both energy-demanding sectors and society (cities, households, and mobility). The double-layered actions parallel the classical “cascade control” employed in industrial sectors. For achieving deep decarbonization, the ambitious net-zero emissions (NZE), large-scale deployment of renewables demand storage, with hydrogen as a prominent chemical storage alternative, and carbon capture & storage (CCS) for hard-to-electrify sectors. Infrastructure developments need policy and capital investments, and geopolitics and resource availability challenge and offer opportunities. Since decarbonization and electrification have multiple realization paths and impact the industrial metabolism, SDGs are interconnected with synergies and trade-offs. Prioritization of SDGs by policymakers is necessary for resilience and robustness in achieving climate goals within a systems dynamics approach. This critical review identifies niches in decarbonization and electrification, enlightening the industrial metabolism under the lens of SDGs.

Climate actions (SDG-13) aim at limiting global warming by targeting carbon emissions reduction. With the energy industry recognized as a significant CO2  emitter, SDG-13 policies mostly translate energy transition to renewables (SDG-7) and the electrification of end-users, both energy-demanding sectors and society (cities, households, and mobility). The double-layered actions parallel the classical “cascade control” employed in industrial sectors. For achieving deep decarbonization, the ambitious net-zero emissions (NZE), large-scale deployment of renewables demand storage, with hydrogen as a prominent chemical storage alternative, and carbon capture & storage (CCS) for hard-to-electrify sectors. Infrastructure developments need policy and capital investments, and geopolitics and resource availability challenge and offer opportunities. Since decarbonization and electrification have multiple realization paths and impact the industrial metabolism, SDGs are interconnected with synergies and trade-offs. Prioritization of SDGs by policymakers is necessary for resilience and robustness in achieving climate goals within a systems dynamics approach. This critical review identifies niches in decarbonization and electrification, enlightening the industrial metabolism under the lens of SDGs.

The 17 SDGs are inherently interconnected, so interventions in one sector trigger other effects. SDG-7, SDG-8, and SDG-13 illustrate a complex interplay of environmental and socioeconomic issues. SDG-7 [Affordable and Clean Energy] fosters the development and dissemination of renewable and sustainable energy resources. By targeting to limit energy carbon intensity, it enforces SDG-13 [Climate Action], which focuses on urgent measures to combat climate change and its impacts. These environment-oriented goals (SDG-7 and SDG-13) act on industry and society, modifying their economic and social performances, and impacting SDG-8 [Decent Work and Economic Growth]. Such interconnected system – environment, economy, and society – mimics a metabolism named Industrial Metabolism [2 ,3 ]. Despite SDG-8, economic growth has unsustainable paths that jeopardize the environment-oriented SDG-13, SDG-14 [Life Below Water], and SDG-15 [Life on Earth] [1] . Burke and Melgar [4]  warn that SDG-7′s focus on energy access risks ecological boundary breaches affecting SDG-10 [Reduced Inequalities]. The authors recommend reducing fossil sources and energy intensity to achieve SDG-7’s objectives, curbing demand through taxation. Although the SDGs aim for policy coherence in implementation, McGowan et al. [5]  found uneven interlinkages between goals, which may undermine SDG's policy initiatives. Lyytimäki et al. [6]  move from pinpointing SDGs to identifying potential trade-offs and synergies from a cross-matrix examination of targets in Finland, with most SDGs being synergic. Several decarbonization alternatives are underway, from the retirement of fossil-based feedstocks and growth of the share of renewables in the energy matrix to innovative technologies. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is becoming crucial to closing the decarbonization gap by reducing emissions from fossil-fueled power plants (new and existing) and hard-to-decarbonize sectors. Lau et al. [7]  emphasize the importance of regional corridors for scaling up CCS, leveraging public-private partnerships, and creating supportive policy frameworks such as carbon pricing and incentives for technology transfer. Lowering the carbon intensity of products, processes, and services may occur by (a) substitution of feedstocks and technologies [ Reframe] ; (b) retrofitting existing processes [ Reshape] ; (c) Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS), with attention to innovative Vehicle-to-Power (V2P), fuel cell electric vehicle (FVC or FCEV) and nature-based solutions to carbon emissions mitigation [ Recycle] ; (d) Nature positive alternatives to reduce atmospheric carbon results in negative carbon emissions, i.e., beyond Net-Zero-Emissions (NZE) aimed by sustainability-promoting initiatives. Under this classification, the leading technologies are bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) and Direct Air Capture (DAC) with CCS [ Regenerate]. Fig. 1   pictures the scene of decarbonization approached in the present review, which places electrification as a growing decarbonization reshape-oriented alternative: the matrix entry [Growth, Reshape]. The main initiatives highlighted in Fig. 1  are introduced in the sub-sections Electrification & Storage; Decarbonization & CCS; and Systems Dynamics & Policies, paving the way to state the Original Contribution of this work. 1.1 Electrification & storage Industrial processes can use electricity directly (e.g., high-temperature heat pumps replacing fossil-fuel-based alternatives for thermal energy) or indirectly, through electrosyntheses to produce electro-fuels and electro-feedstocks (e.g., electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen followed by hydrogenation of carbon dioxide). Some technologies are already available, while others are in the early stages of development [8] . Kim [9]  pinpoints the characteristics of power-to-heat technologies for thermal heating; the context is process design and site-wide utility management for converting steam-based utility systems to electricity-based ones. Sakamoto et al. [10]  focus on demand-side decarbonization in Japan, showing that the electricity share in energy use must ramp up to 66% in 2050 to reduce emissions by 80%. The intensification of electricity consumption due to electrification parallels the growth of renewables share in electricity matrices. Therefore, much effort is needed to add resilience to intermittency in renewable energy supply through energy storage technologies for safe electrification. Mitali et al. [11]  review Energy Storage Systems (ESS) categorized by the form of energy stored, including thermal, mechanical, chemical, electrochemical, electrical, magnetic fields, and hybrid storage. Pumped-hydro and thermal energy storage systems are crucial for large-scale applications, while batteries are ideal for high power and energy requirements. The authors state hydrogen and methane have great potential but low efficiency [11] . Chemical energy storage remains costly, with ongoing research. Sensible heat storage and compressed-air energy storage have significant spatial and investment demands but offer reliable long-term energy solutions [11] . Renewable energy ancillary services (AS), such as regulation, frequency control, voltage support, and ramping, are essential for integrating renewables into the grid. Xiao et al. [12]  proposed models to evaluate the economic potential of various ESS, including AS, under a comprehensive market environment. The authors underscore the necessity for ESS development in electricity markets to facilitate high renewable energy penetration while maintaining stable ancillary services [12] .  1.2 Decarbonization & CCS Various decarbonization alternatives are being employed, from energy efficiency and energy switching (i.e., energy transition to renewables) to replacing fossil-based feedstocks (e.g., the bio-based economy), as in Fan et al. [13] . Van Dyk et al. [14]  evaluate the drop-in potential of co-processing fossil and bio-based feedstocks in existing oil refineries. Sun et al. [15]  examine decarbonization opportunities for US refineries to achieve plant-level and life-cycle carbon emissions reduction (e.g., scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions). Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and carbon offset initiatives are the ultimate resources for hard-to-decarbonize industries. Byrum et al. [16]  find that switching to clean hydrogen, electrification, and CCS can deeply decarbonize refineries. Additionally, shifting to renewable feedstocks to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) and bio-based fuels for shipping and trucking, known as hard-to-abate sectors, may reduce carbon intensities by up to 80%.  1.3 Systems dynamics & policies Implementing novel policies and strategies is necessary to alter energy intensity in demand-side industries [17] . It is also imperative to align the electrification rate to the decarbonization pace of the power industry, as this is critical in achieving CO2  emissions reduction targets from the power sector in a scenario characterized by escalated electrification. Khanna et al. [17]  report on China's initiative for deep electrification through sectoral policies and more efficient end-use equipment. Qiu et al. [18]  argue that decarbonizing the electricity sector increases the terrestrial ecotoxicity and metal depletion levels per ton of CO2  avoided via DAC, an environmental problem-shifting. Policy initiatives to reduce carbon intensity are the primary policy objective of climate action: SDG-13 commands SDG-7, which acts on a complex and interconnected industrial metabolism supplying society demands while magnifying and underlying the remaining SDGs.  1.4 Original contribution Although the perception of SDG interlinkage has been explored in the literature in a broader context – e.g., Burke and Melgar [4] , McGown et al. [5] , and Lyytimäki et al. [6] , policymakers have mostly overridden the remaining UN SDGs and driven transitions majorly weighted by SDG-13. One main novelty of this work is the vision of how policymakers decide on climate actions. Hierarchically, energy policies are defined from a top-down perspective – climate policies down to industrial metabolism through energy policy, arranged in a cascade structure illustrated in Fig. 2  . In it, climate control tracks global warming deviations from the established goals, acting on energy policies to mitigate climate changes, uniquely targeting to limit carbon emissions. Due to its strong interdependency, the industrial metabolism and society respond to policies affecting other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) besides mitigating global warming. Therefore, a critical review of interconnected sectors, policies, and SDGs is necessary to envision the hidden consequences of climate mitigation actions. This work targets the novelty of fulfilling this gap. The cascade control architecture (Fig. 2 ) is explained to present the novel vision further. It consists of two feedback loops, with the output of the Master Control Loop  (Climate Actions, SDG-13) defining the setpoint for the Slave Control Loop (Clean energy, SDG-7). The Master Loop controls the primary variable (global warming), manipulating the atmospheric carbon concentration target inferred through the economy’s carbon intensity. The Slave Loop regulates the secondary variable (carbon intensity), which impacts the primary variable through the energy sector's carbon emissions, driving the energy transition toward renewables. The cascade control architecture compensates for disturbances in carbon emissions before effects from exogenous factors (i.e., disturbances) alter the performance of the Master Loop. Examples of dynamic disturbances are (a) growth of a country’s gross domestic product (GDP) and population; (b) climate changes that affect the supply of renewables; (c) deployment of new technologies that affect the carbon intensity of the industrial metabolism; and (d) social issues of the local population. The overall performance depends on the dynamic profile of these disturbances and how policymakers tune climate and energy policies. This work surveys the literature to identify the impacts, synergic and antagonistic, of climate policy on energy transition and how SDGs are co-adjuvating in the energy transition. Additionally, the survey intends to capture the industrial metabolism's capacity to adapt to climate, energy policies, and society. Also, the work presents an analysis of companies from each industrial sector through their sustainability reports to infer the industrial metabolism's socioeconomic and environmental responses to climate and energy policies. Finally, the work aims to enlighten how the energy transition is coping with the complexity of the system's dynamics (SD) in electrification and decarbonization. Summing up, answers to three original questions are sought: (i) How is the energy transition coping with the SDGs? (ii) How do the sectors respond to climate and energy policies? (iii) How much aware of SD are the electrification and decarbonization actions? Consequently, this study offers insights that underscore the criticality of aligning policy, industry practices, and sustainability efforts, ultimately steering policymakers and society toward a more sustainable trajectory. Fig. 3   displays the structure and purpose of the work.   2 Methods The review follows a three-step procedure. Firstly, the literature is surveyed to identify how the industrial sectors are coping with the SDGs adapting to the energy transition policies. The following sectors are investigated: Automotive; Aviation; Cement; Chemical & Petrochemical; Cities & Rural Communities; Energy; Heavy truck; Mining; Oil & Gas; Shipping; and Steel. Next, the Sustainability Reports are analyzed, aiming to identify actions of the industrial sectors and eventual gaps from the academic literature in their perception. Since cross-sector interactions occur, Systems Dynamics (SD) becomes relevant in the context of climate and energy policies. Two additional reviews are presented to enlighten whether stakeholders consider SD in their energy transition actions: “SD and Decarbonization” and “SD and Electrification”. 2.1 Procedure and premises of the literature surveys Three literature surveys are proposed to answer the questions “How is the energy transition coping with the SDGs?” – survey (a), and “How much aware of SD are the electrification and decarbonization actions?” – surveys (b) and (c) [19] . For each survey, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) is used to review and identify the most relevant documents. PRISMA is an evidence-based minimum set of items for reporting in systematic reviews and meta-analyses [20] . PRISMA items under the specificities of the present work comprise:(i) Protocol and registration –  The systematic review's structure is a rigorous roadmap formulated under the PRISMA guidelines' criteria.  (ii) Eligibility criteria –  The eligibility criteria are based on the Sustainable Development Goals (survey (a)) and Systems Dynamics (surveys (b) and (c)).  (iii) Information sources –  The bibliographic search includes articles and reviews from the Scopus database published from 2016 to 2023.  (iv) Search –  The keywords applied in the Boolean strings aim to evaluate the questions in each survey.  (v) Classification –  Information in each article is extracted from Title, Abstract, and Keywords. Support classification is defined as (a) analyzed sector; and (b) relevant sustainability development goal (SDG.). The citation of each article is compiled to infer impact.  (vi) Analysis – The information extracted is analyzed with the content of the most relevant articles in each sector and each SDG.    The searches included works published only in the English language. Moreover, Scopus database options search were: “title, abstract, and keywords”. Fig. 4   pictures the Boolean search keywords and architecture.  2.2 Procedure and premises of sustainability reports' analysis The sustainability reports communicate the adoption of decarbonization alternatives in the companies' portfolios. They are the basis for answering the question, “How are the sectors responding to the climate and energy policies?”. Three companies are chosen from each sector among their five most prominent companies. The reports are published by the evaluated industries, ranging from 2021 to 2022.   3 Results: answers to the proposed questions This section presents the literature surveys and the analysis of the Sustainability Reports as findings to answer the three questions: (i) “How is the energy transition coping with the SDGs?” (ii) “How are the sectors responding to climate and energy policies?” (iii) “ How much aware of SD are the electrification and decarbonization actions?” . Fig. 4  shows the literature surveys used to answer questions (i) and (iii). 3.1 PRISMA method results: how is the energy transition coping with the SDGs? Fig. 5   presents the PRISMA flow diagram: 486 documents were identified for the keywords. Application of the eligibility criteria eliminated 352 works (7 exceeded the time window – January 2016 to February 2023; two were not written in English; and 62 were excluded from the final analysis for not being neither articles nor reviews). Table 1   [21–130 ] lists the articles and reviews from the literature survey (Figs. 4 (a) and 5 (a)). Among innovations in the electrification of the automotive sector is the implementation of hydrogen Fuel-Cell Vehicles (FCV), a demand-side decarbonization requiring public policies. While market-driven options may work for long-term FCV adoption, some policy intervention is necessary for the short run to counterbalance macroeconomic curbs and motivate consumer demand. Recommended interventions include motivating consumers and manufacturers, public investment in R&D, incentives for FCV ownership, development of public awareness, transitioning to carbon pricing for conventional transportation, low-carbon fuel policy development, showcasing low-carbon FCVs, and gradually phasing out conventional cars through regulation of the established traditional market of vehicle [21] . Another potential benefit brought to Electric Vehicle (EV) architecture is the dual Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) [23] . Dual HESS-EV offers a driving range-per-cost ratio higher than the best single HESS EV solution. It also has an improved driving-range-per-mass ratio and increased battery lifetime compared to the single HESS EV, which is more attractive for long-term operation [23] . Dual HESS-EV shows the relevance of novel technologies in improving batteries' efficiency. Battery-supported electric cooking offers a way to address the need for access to modern energy, mitigate climate change, and improve the lives of the poor by facilitating grid extension and promoting off-grid solutions [35] . Leary et al. [35]  highlight the need for a policy environment that bridges the gap from the concept to the practice of clean cooking. Aziz and Chowdhury [74]  evaluate the electrification performance of 21 mini-grids in Bangladesh, measuring the cost-effectiveness of bringing electricity to off-grid populations. Results show slight variation in the cost-effectiveness of electricity generation capacity but significant variation in performance in selling electricity to customers and reaching total capacity within a given time. The authors encourage small-scale urbanization, focusing on commercially active areas with more daytime electricity consumption; and investigating the break-even costs and financially-viable capacity, based on population density and distribution [74] . On the materials supply side, Nhuchhen et al. [24]  evaluate the electrification and decarbonization potential of the cement sector with oxy-combustion coupled to CCS using either oxygen from air separation units (ASUs) or byproduct oxygen from water electrolysis to generate hydrogen fuel. However, the cement sector must consider the reliability of the supply and the economic benefit hydrogen producers require from their byproduct. For hard-to-decarbonize sectors, CCS is a large-scale carbon sink. Nevertheless, Grant et al. (2022) [115]  question the assumption that carbon storage is a low-cost and globally available resource in most low-carbon scenarios. The authors introduce the "investable potential" concept, which considers financial, contractual, and institutional barriers to CO2  storage. Their results suggest that low-carbon scenarios which assume abundant CO2  storage may overestimate the role of CCS in deep decarbonization. The authors conclude that the optimal use of CCS depends on the availability of CO2  storage and present an analysis of the potential for cross-border trade in captured CO2  to match sources and sinks. These findings provide insights for policy decisions on the role of CCS in addressing climate change. The Oil&Gas (O&G) or Coal sectors rely strongly on CCS. Bach [112]  states that traditional patterns of interaction between the O&G  industry and the climate regime have been disrupted as firms joined or created climate governance initiatives. The sector is exploring a low-carbon role, relying on technologies (e.g., CCS), economic instruments (e.g., carbon pricing), and process optimization (e.g., flaring reduction and energy efficiency). However, the industry must confront its historical responsibility for climate change and its future role in a low-carbon world; more apparent roles and responsibilities are needed [112] . Fig. 6   displays the Materiality Matrix condensing survey (a). It considers the number of citations for each article (literature impact) and the percentage of articles dealing with a given SDG and sector. From the results presented, the energy transition is biased by SDG-13 and SDG-7, suggesting that the other objectives have been neglected despite their recognized impact on society. Fig. 7   adopts a correlation intensity with the number of citations (Fig. 7 (a)) and documents (Fig. 7 (b)). The illustration uses four clusters of SDGs aligned with economic activity (cluster I), environment (cluster II), land & well-being (cluster III), and social goals (cluster IV). The analysis evaluates titles, abstracts, and keywords to identify which cluster and SDGs relate to each work's scope. SDG-7 and SDG-13 guide climate and energy policies, standing beyond synergies and trade-offs. Wei and co-workers (2023) [131]  show that SDGs are mainly synergistic, while a few (e.g., SDG-13 and SDG-15) pose trade-offs to other SDGs. Pradhan and co-workers (2017) [132]  claim that synergies outweigh trade-offs for most SDGs. Poverty is a barrier to implementing SDGs, amplifying trade-offs, and inhibiting synergies [131] . Fig. 7 (c) presents SDGs connecting to SDG-7 based on the results of Wei et al. [131] , Pradhan et al. [132] , and Shirazi and Simurina [117] . It is worth noting that the interconnections are heuristically perceived and vary according to the origin of the study (techno-economic or social).  3.2 “How are the sectors responding to the climate and energy policies?” The sectors with the most robust alignment towards electrification are the Automotive and Cities and Rural Communities. Both sectors are pursuing integrating renewable energy sources within scope 1 to reduce carbon emissions. The Automotive industry focus on electrifying its production facilities, while Cities and Rural Communities invest heavily in solar panels, hydropower, and wind energy. Table 2   presents the analysis of the companies sustainability reports, identifying and classifying the decarbonization technology by scopes 1, 2, and 3. Solar energy has a relevant application niche in sustainable cities, while CCS is the most used emissions reduction technology among industrial sectors. Aviation heavily invests in alternative low-carbon fuels, the SAFs (Sustainable Aviation Fuels). The Automotive industry relies on Electric Vehicles (EV) to reduce scope 3 emissions, and renewable energy to power EVs. On the other hand, a significant technological investment in enhanced storage technologies is observed mainly in EVs, such as new batteries material and fuel cells (Fuel-Cell Vehicles, FCV). Additionally, fast-loading power stations are pledged to improve the charging period and auxiliaries for the electrification of Heavy Truck  industry (scope 3). For scope 3 emissions, all sectors rely on COI as the most prominent climate action. Besides the Automotive industry, another sector that is investing in battery advancements is Mining for the electrification of their electric truck fleet and reducing the scope 1 emissions. Mining also invests in renewable energy consumption to minimize the scope 2 emissions. Mining and Steel are both working with recycling, and COI for scope 3 reductions. It is worth noting that the O&G industry must reduce emissions from their operations (scope 1) and use of their products (e.g., fuels and electricity, scope 3). CCS technologies are needed for the remaining emissions, accompanied by protecting natural carbon sinks and offering nature-based solutions to their clients to offset unavoidable emissions. Fig. 8   shows the Technical SDGs and Governance SDGs shared by the sector, which is perceived from the evaluated Sustainability Reports. The sectors respond to the climate and energy policies within identified opportunity niches. For instance, Mining recognizes the relevance of its products to batteries, reducing scope 3 emissions of other sectors (producing transition metals to batteries). Fig. 8  evidences that, for the technical SDGs, the industries with the most significant alignment are O&G,  Automotive,  Steel,  Energy, and Chemical & Petrochemical, with a dominance of SDG-7, SDG-12, and SDG-13. SDGs classified as “Governance SDGs ” show special recognition by O&G,  Aviation,  Automotive, and Chemical & Petrochemical. Finally, the analysis of Cities’ UN Reports selected three medium (≈0.5 MM habitants) and large (>1 MM habitant) cities from different continents and identified a unanimous concern with the SDGs and report actions for advancing in technical and governance objectives. The O&G industry applies CCS and CCUS technologies to decarbonize their scope 1. However, the investigated Sustainability Reports do not evidence consciousness of Systems Dynamics aspects in the companies' strategies for decarbonizing their portfolios.  3.3 “How much aware of SD are the electrification and decarbonization actions?” Decision-making in complex systems demands systems thinking approaches. Selvakkumaran and Ahlgren (2020) [133]  review articles using the Systems Dynamics (SD) approach to analyze “local energy transitions”. Their findings show that most local energy transitions employed Stock and Flow Diagrams in SD methodology. Based on the literature review, the present work presents the complex global system in Fig. 9  , which shows carbon fluxes and inventories cross-interacting with industrial sectors. The overall picture illustrates an industrial metabolism extracting carbon from resources and returning it as atmospheric fluxes, anthropogenic removals that are permanent (CCS) or temporary (CCU), energy substitution by renewables, and the needed energy storage alternatives. Despite the highly interconnected nature of the system, climate and energy policies apparently disregard approach the problem with a Systems Dynamics (SD) framework. Selvakkumaran and Ahlgren (2020) [133]  list justifications provided by authors to employ SD analysis to local energy transitions, with the most cited being “dynamics, feedbacks, delays, and complexity”, followed by “systematic thinking”. Concerning the SDGs orchestration for enhancing sustainability, Voulvoulis et al. (2022) [134]  identify a growing use of SD to enable sustainability. The authors state that even people with strong backgrounds in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are not familiar with the basic elements of complex dynamic systems. The most challenging aspect is that the “controlled system” is self-adapting. As Voulvoulis et al. (2022) [134]  state, the system’s behavior is shaped by policies, infrastructure, pricing mechanisms, and education. Fig. 10   evolves from Fig. 2 , considering the industrial metabolism and society in an interlinked “process” to be controlled under the cascade architecture of climate policies (Master Loop) and energy policies (Slave Loop). Tuning a system for fast responses when multiple challenges are posed (e.g., industrial metabolism interacting with society) is cumbersome because the system to be controlled is self-adaptive and presents long time constants and time delays. Policymakers must be conscious of the system's stability limits before specifying the system's settling times, such as deadlines for Net Zero Emissions. 3.3.1 Electrification and systems dynamics Despite addressing a global consequence (i.e., global warming), climate policies act primarily on local initiatives and specific sectoral concerns with a safeguard of addressing two sustainable development goals, SDG-7, and SDG-13. A literature survey crosses Systems Dynamics (SD) and Electrification to identify systems thinking levels, shown in Table 3  [135–171] , following Figs. 4 (b) and 5 (b). Garces et al. [137]  assessed the feasibility of transitioning off-grid communities in Colombia from diesel to renewable energy sources through an SD model. The current electricity access deficit in low and middle-income countries, and the limited availability of electricity in off-grid communities, often powered by expensive and polluting diesel, are discussed. The authors suggest that not only is a transition from diesel to renewables achievable, but it is also economically viable and desirable. Riva et al. [141]  suggest that the SD approach may be more appropriate due to its requirement for less quantitative data and its ability to provide a holistic modeling framework for understanding the complexities affecting electrification in off-grid areas. Ercan et al. [162]  examine the potential electrification and environmental impacts of autonomous electric vehicles (AEV) compared to other transportation options, including public transportation, carpooling, walking, cycling, and transportation policy applications such as limiting lane-mile increases and carbon tax. The results suggest that adopting AEV can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 34% of the total emissions from transportation by 2050. The authors highlight the need for a paradigm shift in the transportation industry's practices with disruptive automation, electrification, and shared transport reforms to reduce transportation-related impacts. Laimon et al. [146]  propose an SD approach to examine the impact of renewable energy systems and energy efficiency on the Australian energy sector. The authors suggest that improving energy efficiency by 1% could significantly reduce domestic CO2  emissions by 2030/2050. Switching to renewable energy for transportation, increasing renewable electricity usage, and electrifying other sectors with renewable energy could lead to zero domestic CO2  emissions by 2050 while energy consumption remains stable [146] . The analysis of the surveyed literature suggests that the mature sectors investing in SD and electrification are Automotive and Cities and Rural Communities. Fig. 11   shows only a few sectors in the search guided by SD and Electrification. As the academic literature suggests, the remaining sectors deal locally with their climate actions and energy transition pathways. The energy sector initiatives mainly substitute fossil sources with renewable energies; electrification is a demand-side initiative. Thus, SD crossed with electrification is not an issue in the literature. Electricity demand will expand remarkably in developing countries and be challenged by providing access to electricity in remote areas, with off-grid technologies, notedly mini-grids (from a hundred to a few thousand costumers). Their complexity suggests that System Dynamics is essential for successful implementation [158] . On the industrial side, electricity consumption is expected to increase with decarbonization through electrification and might cause overburden where the national electricity grid has inadequate infrastructure [8] . Hard-to-electrify sectors will remain dependent on decarbonization through CCS. Cities and Rural Communities and the Automotive industry leads in the holistic perception of the transition, although mainly guided by SDG-13. Shared and automated mobility brings concepts such as Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) and transportation network companies (TNCs), such as Uber and Lyft, adding flexibility on the demand side (customers), which may impact emissions and energy consumption [172] .  3.3.2 Decarbonization and systems dynamics Table 4   [150,152,173–204 ] displays the results from the “SD and Decarbonization” search, analogously to the “SD and Electrification,” as shown in Figs. 4  and 5(c) . Fig. 12   shows Energy, Cities & Rural Communities,  and the Automotive sector as the leading perception of Systems Dynamics. Again, as the academic literature suggests, the remaining sectors deal locally with their climate actions and decarbonization pathways. Blanco et al. [200]  explore strategies to overcome the high initial cost of fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) by combining a detailed simulation model of the passenger transport sector with an energy system model. Gas reforming combined with CO2  storage provides a low-cost hydrogen source for FCEVs in the early years of deployment. The authors focus on an energy system with 95% CO2  reduction by 2050 and do not include country-specific incentives or shifts across modes of transport. Eker et al. [203]  investigated the built environment as a primary focus of decarbonization policies. Still, these policies often have narrow objectives and focus, resulting in “policy resistance” and unintended consequences. The authors present an integrated approach to address these issues by considering housing performance, energy, communal spaces, and well-being, and exploring the System Dynamics of these relationships. Their findings suggest that monitoring is critical to improving housing stock performance, and investments in communal spaces positively affect energy-efficiency measures and resident well-being. Beuse et al. [196]  evaluate the competition between six low-cost electricity-storage technologies (EST) until 2030 and propose policy options to mitigate risks associated with technological lock-in thru decarbonization and SD models. The component-based experience curves with cost floors for battery materials were assessed to derive cost benchmarks for alternative market and technology scenarios. The authors indicate that lithium-ion batteries are likely to outcompete alternative EST by 2030, posing risks associated with technological lock-in. Three policy options are assessed, and the combination of supporting breakthrough technologies and utilizing the improved dynamics of lithium-ion batteries to support alternative active materials, battery designs, and adjacent technologies is the most promising approach [196] . Fig. 12  consolidates the survey pointing to Cities & Rural Communities primarily concerned with climate actions leading to decarbonization with an SD perspective.    4 Final remarks and conclusions The work applies a critical literature review and analyzes sustainability reports from selected industry stakeholders targeting to identify interconnected reactions to climate policies. Also, hidden consequences from those policies in other SDGs are evaluated, and prioritized SDGs are identified in large-scale hard-to-decarbonize sectors where electrification finds barriers. The interconnection of industries and society in a metabolic-like structure shows missing bridges among climate, social and environmental objectives when three questions are investigated: (a) How is the energy transition coping with the SDGs? (b) How are the sectors responding to climate and energy policies? c) How much aware of SDS are the electrification and decarbonization actions? The climate and energy policies that have driven the substitution of fossil-fuel-based energy for renewables follow SDG-13 and SDG-7, as most references reviewed show. From the communicated actions through sectors’ sustainability reports, the Energy, Oil&Gas, and Chemical & Petrochemical industries are more actively acting to reduce emissions, primarily due to their recognized impacts. Nevertheless, efforts are uncoordinated and lack a Systems Dynamics perspective. Cities & Rural Communities and Automotive are the two sectors adopting a systems approach, with electrification efforts. Electrification is thus a demand-side decarbonization alternative conducted in non-orchestrated case-to-case applications, missing a Systems Dynamics control. The main exception comes from mobility, where the demand-side meets supply-side business objectives.   Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.
