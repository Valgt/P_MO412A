The implementation of the Agenda requires strong commitment and accountability. However, as stated in The Lancet  by the University of Oslo Commission on Global Governance for Health,2   mechanisms to hold states accountable for their obligations under international conventions are generally weak. In a recent issue of The Lancet  (Oct 8, p 1813),3   a new monitoring system was introduced for measuring progress towards implementation of the 17 SDGs. Although monitoring the SDGs is undoubtedly important, we believe that the indicators for monitoring the achievement of the goals must be accompanied by critical attention to ambiguities of accountability inherent in the Agenda itself. The Agenda is making big promises, such as “we are determined to end poverty and hunger, in all their forms”.1   At the same time, the Agenda distinguishes between the “we” making the promise and the “we” that is responsible for keeping it: “we have mapped the road to sustainable development; it will be for all of us to ensure that the journey is successful”.1   By mapping the road, the first “we” has done its deed. It is now up to a new and broader “we” to “ensure that the journey is successful”.1   This journey will “involve Governments as well as parliaments, the United Nations system and other international institutions, local authorities, indigenous peoples, civil society, business and the private sector, the scientific and academic community—and all people”. The UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development declaration (Oct 25, 2015) launches a double-duty paradox: sustainable development is about both committing oneself to a promise and committing others to an obligation. Responsibility becomes both all-encompassing and non-existent. The SDGs become everyone's business but no-one's major responsibility. Indeed, should we even come close to achieving the SDGs, we must be able to hold specific agents to account. The responsibility for achieving the goals cannot be entrusted to an unidentifiable and all-encompassing “we”. If everyone is accountable in theory, no one is accountable in practice. In addition to adequate measurements and indicators, we believe that there is a need for a robust formative evaluation system that scrutinises accountability mechanisms and possible double-duty paradoxes embedded in the operationalisation and implementation of the SDGs. We declare no competing interests.
