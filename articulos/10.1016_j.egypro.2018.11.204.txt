                  A review on the challenges faced by Nigeria researchers, in other to meet up with the sustainable development goals has been carried out. The roles of researcher in the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals cannot be taking for granted. This paper has reviewed some aspects of the challenges faced by researcher in terms of policies making, funds, populations, inadequate research equipment and quality education. The outcome of this study shows that the greatest limitations affecting researchers from development and survival in Nigeria to meet up the sustainable development goals are lack of funding supports, poor organization, fraud, absence of training for gaining knowledge, poor infrastructure, poor technology and low request for product and services. When all this are put in place this will help the researchers to carry out effective research on how Nigeria can meet the demand for the SDGS.

The 15th International Symposium on District Heating and Cooling Assessing the feasibility of using the heat demand-outdoor  temperature function for a long-term district heat demand forecast I. AndriÄ‡a,b,c*, A. Pinaa, P. FerrÃ£oa, J. Fournierb., B. LacarriÃ¨rec, O. Le Correc aIN+ Center for Innovation, Technology and Policy Research - Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, Av. Rovisco Pais 1, 1049-001 Lisbon, Portugal bVeolia Recherche & Innovation, 291 Avenue Dreyfous Daniel, 78520 Limay, France cDÃ©partement SystÃ¨mes Ã‰nergÃ©tiques et Environnement - IMT Atlantique, 4 rue Alfred Kastler, 44300 Nantes, France Abstract District heating networks are commonly addressed in the literature as one of the most effective solutions for decreasing the  greenhouse gas emissions from the building sector. These systems require high investments which are returned through the heat sales. Due to the changed climate conditions and building renovation policies, heat demand in the future could decrease,  prolonging the investment return period.  The main scope of this paper is to assess the feasibility of using the heat demand â€“ outdoor temperature function for heat demand  forecast. The district of Alvalade, located in Lisbon (Portugal), was used as a case study. The district is consisted of 665  buildings that vary in both construction period and typology. Three weather scenarios (low, medium, high) and three district  renovation scenarios were developed (shallow, intermediate, deep). To estimate the error, obtained heat demand values were  compared with results from a dynamic heat demand model, previously developed and validated by the authors. The results showed that when only weather change is considered, the margin of error could be acceptable for some applications (the error in annual demand was lower than 20% for all weather scenarios considered). However, after introducing renovation  scenarios, the error value increased up to 59.5% (depending on the weather and renovation scenarios combination considered).  The value of slope coefficient increased on average within the range of 3.8% up to 8% per decade, that corresponds to the  decrease in the number of heating hours of 22-139h during the heating season (depending on the combination of weather and  renovation scenarios considered). On the other hand, function intercept increased for 7.8-12.7% per decade (depending on the  coupled scenarios). The values suggested could be used to modify the function parameters for the scenarios considered, and  improve the accuracy of heat demand estimations. Â© 2017 The Authors.

OECD  nations need to better adjust their residential approaches to environmental change targets. They likewise need to  present market-based measures, for example, discharge exchanging frameworks, carbon assessments and  appropriation changes, and to join these arrangements with centered projects for innovation advancement and  dispersion (for example, low carbon emanations vitality sources). Lastly, they have to grow long haul relief  strategies and to fortify their organizations with creating nations, keeping in mind the end goal to balance out  fixations at levels that dodge risky impedance with the atmosphere framework.

In moving in the direction of these objectives, most  OECD nations are guided by the generally acknowledged focus of 0.7% of GNP as a fitting goal for ODA  levels.   ï�¶ Continuing to enable the poorest nations to enhance their ability to partake in the practical advancement  of the worldwide economy. This incorporates building up the arrangement and institutional systems  expected to pull in private capital streams to those nations, while limiting unfriendly ecological or social  effects related with such streams and giving fitting help to innovation co-task.   ï�¶ Where improvement co-task assets are utilized to help the arrangement of worldwide open merchandise  (for example environmental change), concentrating on those exercises that have clear neighborhood  advantages, and which additionally create auxiliary advantages at the local and worldwide levels.    2.1.1 Challenges Faced by Nigeria Researcher in Terms of Policies Making in Responding to Climate  Change    Tending to environmental change is an especially critical test, requiring solid worldwide co-activity and initiative  from OECD nations to act quickly to accomplish the moderation levels imagined under the Kyoto Protocol. OECD  nations need to better adjust their residential approaches to environmental change targets. They likewise need to  present market-based measures, for example, discharge exchanging frameworks, carbon assessments and  appropriation changes, and to join these arrangements with centered projects for innovation advancement and  dispersion (for example, low carbon emanations vitality sources). Lastly, they have to grow long haul relief  strategies and to fortify their organizations with creating nations, keeping in mind the end goal to balance out  fixations at levels that dodge risky impedance with the atmosphere framework.   Utilize a far-reaching way to deal with atmosphere moderation by:   ï�¶ Extending relief to all wellsprings of ozone harming substances and carbon evacuation through sinks.   ï�¶ Incorporating into atmosphere strategies both the auxiliary advantages of moderation arrangements, and  the atmosphere advantages of different approaches (e.g. vitality effectiveness and enhancement).   396 O.S.I. Fayomi  et al. / Energy Procedia 157 (2019) 393â€“4044 Author name / Energy Procedia 00 (2018) 000â€“000  ï�¶ Reforming appropriations that expansion outflows or lessen take-up by sinks, particularly in transport,  vitality and horticulture, and think about measures to ease change.   ï�¶ Assessing and giving an account of the suggestions for discharges of ozone harming substances of help  gave by Export Credit Agencies.   ï�¶ Supporting exploration and innovation extends that expel boundaries to the take-up of more vitality  proficient advancements and less carbon-concentrated vitality sources, and research on the social changes  liable to emerge from approach changes.   ï�¶ Developing predictable methodologies for observing and following outflows, to empower straightforward  revealing, check and audit, and to improve consistence.   ï�¶ Developing adjustment techniques to diminish presentation to dangers of environmental change and to  encourage the progress to examples of living that are less defenseless against atmosphere impacts.   ï�¶ Raising attention to environmental change, its effects, costs and the advantages of approach activities,  through data and exchange with the groups and divisions most influenced, to encourage the progress to  new types of work and utilization.     Create arrangements to manage alleviation over the long haul, for balancing out fixations at levels that keep away  from risky impedance with the atmosphere framework by:   ï�¶ Identifying and assessing discharge limits reliable with the destinations of the Framework Convention on  Climate Change.   ï�¶ Encouraging cooperation of creating nations in moderation approaches â€“ a fundamental advance for  decreasing environmental change over the more drawn out term.   ï�¶ Using different types of budgetary and specialized help to help creating nations to upgrade their ability to  actualize atmosphere alleviation and adjustment arrangements.    2.2 CHALLENGES FACED BY NIGERIA RESEARCHER IN TERMS OF FUNDS    When driving subjective research, the bleeding edge expert has a combination of options open with a particular  ultimate objective to assemble data from individuals. But standard eye to eye interviews remain prominent,  imaginative correspondence developments, for instance, inspectors have empowered new techniques for  correspondence. While potential research masses have ended up being dynamically geologically scattered,  mechanical types of progress and programming have made granting over extensive detachments more possible.  Thusly, investigate is never again limited to eye to eye open individuals, as online procedures have urged access to  overall research individuals [5].  The part of colleges in human capital advancement, examine and mechanical development can't be thought little of.  Everywhere throughout the world interest in college instruction is a basic part of national advancement exertion.  Countries today depend progressively on information, thoughts and abilities which are delivered in colleges (World  Bank, 1998; OECD, 2001). As a country's learning industry, colleges increment the gainful limit of the work drive.  Since industry and general society area request abnormal state labor the part of the college is to fulfill this request.  Be that as it may, higher instructive organizations in Nigeria are stood up to with a few difficulties. Initially is the  issue of financing.     The subsidizing of Nigerian colleges had deteriorated. The impacts had stayed smothering for college managers,  which were prompted absence of responsibility, misuse of open assets, inefficient expenditure, debasement and  removal of needs [6-8]. Contrasted with other creating nations in Africa through increment in instructive  expenditure, Nigeria has kept up a little level of financial portion to training. The rate extent of real to planned use  was just about 100% in Zimbabwe from 1990 to 1993 individually. This was trailed by Kenya having 90.1% in 1990  and increases to 94% in 1993 to 1995 respectively.     The previous politically-sanctioned racial segregation South Africa likewise expanded its genuine to spending use  from just about 90% of every 1990 to 94% out of 1995. Nigeria in actuality performed nearly more awful than these  different nations as well as its proportion of genuine to spending use on training really deteriorated from 85% in  1990 to 77% in 1993 to 1995 separately (UNESCO, record Yearbook, 1997). In alternative manner, World Bank  (1999), demonstrated that the instructive expenditure in Botswana, ascended from 6.0% in 1980, and increases   Author name / EnergyProcedia 00 (2018) 000â€“000 5  10.4% in 1996; Ivory Coast from 7.2% in 1980 also increases to 7.7% of every 1990; Ghana from 3.1% to 3.3%  from 1980 to 1995; Kenya from 6.0% to 7.1% from 1980 to 1995; and South Africa from 6.0% to 7.9% from 1980  to 1995. On account of Nigeria instructive expenditure nose-plunged from 6.0% to 1.2% from 1980 to 1985 and in  this manner declined relentlessly to a grim 0.9% since 1995. Due to the above situation, the unexpected issue of the  mind networks, modern strikes and decrease in registration for graduate examinations in the run is no longer a  special case in Nigerian colleges today. Today the Nigerian college framework keeps on affliction from scholarly  discharge made by the issue of mind deplete [9].     The ramifications of this improvement are that in view of migration of innovative know-how, the economy can't  develop. Numerous great understudies who likely would have selected for graduate courses in the basic controls to  advance the essential social ability in Nigeria have no educators to direct their investigations. Subsequently, the truly  necessary scholarly limit with regards to the future can't be manufactured. Once more, this issue of declining  accounts to the colleges is unavoidable everywhere throughout the African mainland. According to the ADB  distributed give an account of African Development Indicators, the association infers that the accomplishments of  African colleges are compelled by poor financing with regards to rising asset prerequisites and heightening swelling.  This circumstance additionally clarifies some portion of the human investment departure from the landmass (African  Development Bank (ADB), 1998). Second is the of instructor/understudy proportion. As per UNESCO record  Yearbook (1997) and Federal Office of Statistics (1995), have the proportion of 1:8 for Kenya and Zimbabwe, while  Ethiopia, (1:18), Nigeria, (1:19) and South Africa (1:28.5). Utilizing the above proportions as markers of fragment  of the duties of college instructors for the five African nations, it ends up clear that the normal college teacher in  Ethiopia, Nigeria and South Africa worries about substantially heavier concern than his partner in Kenya or  Zimbabwe. For instance, of Nigeria may even be more regrettable on account of the requirements under which the  scholarly staff in this nation is compelled to work [10]. Thus, several authors presume that the nature of graduates is  poor to the point that their effect on the nationwide economy as far as profitability is for the most part beneath the  compulsory standard for a creating economy. Because of absence of competent scholarly staff, the registration for  graduate examinations has likewise deteriorated.    A few teachers really lecture at least two courses or more than that in a semester. Far more detestable, numerous  speakers instruct for a long time with sub-doctorate degrees. The Nigerians colleges can never again draw in  youthful brilliant personalities. The rein of veteranâ€™s well-past retirement-age instructors tying down the framework.  Third, the effect of the monetary change program on the colleges has been extremely grave. The human investment  that is lost from the colleges has been connected in different segments of the budget [10]. The teachers who left the  colleges have received various procedures to adjust to the effect of the change. As a gathering of experts, with their  exchange association the Academic Staff of Union of Universities (ASUU), communicated sentiments of distance  and hardship. They have regularly set out on modern strikes which have influenced the lives of their understudies.  These strikes have been over issues of pay rates, incidental advantages, work fulfillment and self-completion. The  Nigerian college framework today is ugly to any youthful and eager gentleman and lady in respect to their partners  in other West African states.     The consequences of the examination uncover that the most well-known imperatives impeding scientists from  development and survival in Nigeria are absence of money related help, poor administration, defilement, absence of  preparing and experience, poor foundation, inadequate benefits, and low interest for item and administrations [11].    2.3 CHALLENGES FACED BY NIGERIA RESEARCHER IN TERMS OF POPULATIONS    In general, globalization has given chances to rising economies and creating nations, and lately their development  rates have been reliably higher than development rates in the created world.

Normal per capita  development likewise stows away expanding disparities inside nations, which are additionally somewhat identified  with globalization. A critical piece of the worldwide populace thusly does not profit by union [12].     398 O.S.I. Fayomi  et al. / Energy Procedia 157 (2019) 393â€“4046 Author name / Energy Procedia 00 (2018) 000â€“000  Meanwhile in 1990s, per capita salaries in rising economies have become reliably quicker than in the created world.  Since the turn of the thousand years, development in creating nations has quickened too, driving a general pattern of  meeting in the worldwide economy as appeared in Figure 1. Merging is incompletely determined by globalization,  which has encouraged access to innovation and know-how through more tightly exchange and venture connections  and in this way higher efficiency development in assembling. Actually, fabricating divisions have encountered an  unrestricted union in labor profitability, in other words, a union autonomous of topography or arrangements [13].  Since this does not hold for different parts of the economy, auxiliary changeâ€”a diminishing dependence on the  essential area and a move of assets to higher esteem including assembling and present-day administrations  exercisesâ€”will remain an important state of managed monetary development.   Because of quick development in creating and rising economies, the global economy is wind-up more multipolar,  which unavoidably prompts the production. The progressions should be obliged inside a worldwide. Extending  globalization has encouraged development in creating and rising economies, however has additionally made national  economies more defenseless against outside stuns  Figure 1: Annual development of GDP per capita, high-, low-and center salary nations, 1990-2011 administration.  [14]  .   The extension of worldwide exchange related with the discontinuity of creation likewise adds to worldwide carbon  dioxide (CO2) outflows, with the vehicle area a noteworthy wellspring of those discharges. By and large, globally  exchanged products create discharges that are 50 for every penny higher than those created by privately exchanged  merchandise [14]. Relatedly, the huge extension of worldwide utilization and of changing utilization designs in  rising economies will add to the solid ecological manageability challenge driven initially by unsustainable utilization  designs in created nations (see promote underneath). Financially, preceded with development in rising economies  specifically can be a motor of development for the world economy and gives chances to other creating nations, yet  the gravity moves to China and India, the significant drivers of this procedure, will likewise change the idea of end  showcases and is probably going to posture new difficulties for monetary improvement.     The overall masses accomplished 7 billion out of 2011, this development continue, however at the decreasing rate,  to accomplish a foreseen 9 billion in 2050 [15]. Past total of people advancement, measurement change is depicted  by heterogeneity, as nations are at different periods of their measurement advance. While overall masses  improvement is directing, it is still high in some making countries, and remembering that the aggregate people when  all is said in done is developing rapidly, a couple of countries are seeing an extension in the degree of youth in their  general people. Such better than average assortment, joined with energetic incongruities, along these lines makes  momentary weights both inside countries and all around. These measurement designs act genuine tests for future   Author name / EnergyProcedia 00 (2018) 000â€“000 7  progression plans at all levels: close-by change will be framed by advance development, national change  philosophies should conform to creating measurement structures, and short-lived weights ought to be tended to at  the overall level.     People components are determined by lavishness rates and passing ratesâ€”changes in which are as often as possible  depicted as together constituting the measurement advanceâ€”and development plans. Bona fide cases in made  countries propose a measurement change from a hidden state of high lavishness and high death to a state of low  productivity and low death, where mortality usually rots originally took after at a advanced stage by sudden  lessening in readiness. At the universal level, fruitfulness rates have for quite some time been tumbling from their  peak and the universal richness rate at present stands at 2.52 youngsters for every lady. It is relied upon to fall  further, to 2.17 youngsters for each lady, in 2045-2050. Nonetheless, these midpoints veil incredible heterogeneity  between nations. Ripeness is beneath substitution level in nations that record for half of the worldwide populace, in  particular, most created nations, yet in addition China. It has fallen quickly in numerous creating nations too, while  it stays at any rate created nations, and is anticipated to remain altogether above substitution level in coming decades  (in the same place.). The strengthening of ladies, better access to conception prevention and the delay of marriage  are quick drivers of richness decreases; however, fruitfulness rates are likewise subject to financial advancement,  mortality decays and changes in instruction levels. Attributable to changes in sustenance and general wellbeing and  social improvement all the more extensively, mortality is declining all through the world. Future during childbirth is  at present at 67.9 years and is relied upon to increment to 75.6 years by 2045-2050, in view of increments in all  districts and advancement gatherings. Despite the fact that mortality patterns have been more uniform, there is local  decent variety regardless, with the effect of HIV/AIDS on future in sub-Saharan Africa especially obvious.     Relocation is the third driver of populace flow. Net movement from less created to more created areas has been  expanding relentlessly from 1960 ahead. In the vicinity of 2000 and 2010, created districts pulled in 3.4 million  transients yearly by and large. While these streams rule worldwide movement designs, relocation between creating  nations is additionally noteworthy, and a few of them have pulled in vagrants in substantial numbers, for instance, as  visitor laborers (in the Middle East) and as outcasts (in Africa). Viewing forward, movement designs are harder to  foresee, as they are impacted by a perplexing transaction of monetary, social, statistic, natural and political elements;  however general relocation from less to more created districts is anticipated to proceed, but at a leisurelier pace, in  the times ahead [15].     These statistic drivers prompt four noteworthy worldwide populace drifts: the total populace will keep on growing;  it will develop at a much slower pace than already; it will end up more established; and it will be progressively  urban [16]. These worldwide patterns cover substantial fundamental heterogeneity amongst nations, and they  posture essential difficulties to reasonable advancement, both all around and in particular locales and nations. With  respect to populace development, it achieved its crest in the vicinity of 1965 and 1970, and has decelerated from that  point forward. This pattern will proceed, and by 2050 populace in created nations is required to nearly stagnate, and  populace development in creating nations other than minimum created nations will be 0.50 for each penny every  year, while the number of inhabitants at all created nations will develop at the rate of 1.42 for every penny yearly,  altogether beneath the present rate, yet at the same time sufficiently high to empower populaces to twofold like  clockwork as seen likewise in Figure 2.     This decent variety infers that future increments in total populace will be exceedingly thought geologically. Just  eight nationsâ€”the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, the United  Republic of Tanzania, and the United Statesâ€”will represent half of the anticipated worldwide populace increment.  More troubling is the way that fast populace development proceeds in nations that are the slightest all around  prepared to furnish the vital ventures to manage bigger populaces. Populaces are relied upon to dramatically  increase at all created nations amongst now and 2050, and shy of real improvement advance in these nations, this is  probably going to challenge their economic advancement prospects in various ways. An endless loop of neediness,  absence of training, sick wellbeing, high ripeness and high baby mortality can sustain disparities. Breaking it will  require advance interests in wellbeing and training frameworks, and in addition better access to regenerative  wellbeing administrations and the assurance of ladies' conceptive rights. In the meantime, these speculations must be  supplemented by extending gainful work openings, as a developing number of youngsters enter work markets. Last,   O.S.I.

Future during childbirth is  at present at 67.9 years and is relied upon to increment to 75.6 years by 2045-2050, in view of increments in all  districts and advancement gatherings. Despite the fact that mortality patterns have been more uniform, there is local  decent variety regardless, with the effect of HIV/AIDS on future in sub-Saharan Africa especially obvious.     Relocation is the third driver of populace flow. Net movement from less created to more created areas has been  expanding relentlessly from 1960 ahead. In the vicinity of 2000 and 2010, created districts pulled in 3.4 million  transients yearly by and large. While these streams rule worldwide movement designs, relocation between creating  nations is additionally noteworthy, and a few of them have pulled in vagrants in substantial numbers, for instance, as  visitor laborers (in the Middle East) and as outcasts (in Africa). Viewing forward, movement designs are harder to  foresee, as they are impacted by a perplexing transaction of monetary, social, statistic, natural and political elements;  however general relocation from less to more created districts is anticipated to proceed, but at a leisurelier pace, in  the times ahead [15].     These statistic drivers prompt four noteworthy worldwide populace drifts: the total populace will keep on growing;  it will develop at a much slower pace than already; it will end up more established; and it will be progressively  urban [16]. These worldwide patterns cover substantial fundamental heterogeneity amongst nations, and they  posture essential difficulties to reasonable advancement, both all around and in particular locales and nations. With  respect to populace development, it achieved its crest in the vicinity of 1965 and 1970, and has decelerated from that  point forward. This pattern will proceed, and by 2050 populace in created nations is required to nearly stagnate, and  populace development in creating nations other than minimum created nations will be 0.50 for each penny every  year, while the number of inhabitants at all created nations will develop at the rate of 1.42 for every penny yearly,  altogether beneath the present rate, yet at the same time sufficiently high to empower populaces to twofold like  clockwork as seen likewise in Figure 2.     This decent variety infers that future increments in total populace will be exceedingly thought geologically. Just  eight nationsâ€”the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, the United  Republic of Tanzania, and the United Statesâ€”will represent half of the anticipated worldwide populace increment.  More troubling is the way that fast populace development proceeds in nations that are the slightest all around  prepared to furnish the vital ventures to manage bigger populaces. Populaces are relied upon to dramatically  increase at all created nations amongst now and 2050, and shy of real improvement advance in these nations, this is  probably going to challenge their economic advancement prospects in various ways. An endless loop of neediness,  absence of training, sick wellbeing, high ripeness and high baby mortality can sustain disparities. Breaking it will  require advance interests in wellbeing and training frameworks, and in addition better access to regenerative  wellbeing administrations and the assurance of ladies' conceptive rights. In the meantime, these speculations must be  supplemented by extending gainful work openings, as a developing number of youngsters enter work markets. Last,  400 O.S.I. Fayomi  et al. / Energy Procedia 157 (2019) 393â€“4048 Author name / Energy Procedia 00 (2018) 000â€“000  populace development, specifically in mix with environmental change, can add to nearby natural anxieties and asset  and land shortage.     Inferable from the decrease in fruitfulness and death rates, the worldwide populace will likewise wind up more  seasoned at a quickening pace [17]. The presents of matured people of 60 years and over will increment to 22% for  every naira in 2050, which is on the increase side when compared with 2011 which is 11.2% and in 1950, it was 8%.  In any case, nations are altogether in different stages in their statistic change. Populace maturing is most progressive  in developing nations, prompting sharp increments in reliance proportions and putting a strain on those nations'  wellbeing and annuity frameworks. Developing nations are made up of more young peoples, yet their populaces are  becoming more established also. Fundamentally, the maturing procedure is anticipated to happen at a substantially  higher speed, while family structures experience real changes and family emotionally supportive networks  subsequently assume a littler part. In the event that essential annuity frameworks are inadequate with regards to a  developing offer of more seasoned people will along these lines be in danger of falling into poverty.     Then again, due to their constantly high maturity rates, the minimum producing nations will keep on seeing the  quantity of youth and young people rising. A developing offer of youngsters presents open doors for harvesting a  statistic profit, if a statistic change happens and fruitfulness rates and reliance proportions fall, which, now, is  anticipated to occur in slightest created nations in Asia [19]. Be that as it may, this profit will pay out just if those  economies can make work openings, which will be a noteworthy test for slightest created nations in the decades  ahead. Such aberrations in universal populace progression, in blend with existing wage incongruities, are  additionally adding to proceeded with transitory weights at the worldwide level. On the off chance that tended to in  an intelligible way, relocation can be helpful for the two nations of inception and nations of goal, by mitigatingâ€”in  spite of the fact that in no way, shape or form disposing ofâ€”issues emerging from statistic patterns, and adding to  populace maturing will prompt sharp increments in reliance proportions, while worldwide aberrations in populace  elements and steady wage inconsistencies will increment transitory weights at the worldwide level     Figure 2: Projected populace by improvement district, medium variation, 1950-2050. [14]    The exchanges of knowledge and assets as no satisfactory components at the worldwide level for tending to the  worries of today world. The fourth real pattern is expanding development. Effectively, the greater part of the total  populace lives in cities and urban areas, the most forthcoming populace development will happen in the inner-city  regions of creating nations. At all created nations, the rate of development in urban regions is 4 for every penny for  each year, for the most part determined by rustic urban relocation looking for business [15]. A significant number of  these vagrants live in casual settlements and urban ghettos where they are presented to ecological dangers and   Author name / EnergyProcedia 00 (2018) 000â€“000 9  expanded wellbeing dangers. Environmental change can additionally build these dangers; the same number of urban  communities is in areas especially presented to its belongings [18]. Then again, urbanization offers chances to give  good access to administrations work and bring down cost with lower natural effect. While developing the  framework that will enable chances to be acknowledged, involves tremendous venture and arranging needs, the truth  of proceeded with populace development will render such an endeavor basic to any feasible advancement technique.     With a present populace surpassing 170 million, the Federal Republic of Nigeria is the seventh-biggest nation on the  planet and the most crowded in Africa. Regardless of the presentation of approaches and projects throughout the  most recent 30 years to address Nigeria's fast populace development and the difficulties it postures for advancement;  the nation is anticipated to wind up the third-biggest country on the planet by midcentury [19]. These proceeding  with statistic patternsâ€”combined with rising national needs and new global improvement systemsâ€”made the need  to evaluate the usage of Nigeria's 2004 Policy on Population for Sustainable Development (consequently NPP, or  the strategy). Results from the appraisal are expected to direct the detailing of an amended arrangement and the  methodologies expected to understand its objectives and targets. Accordingly, there are requirements for the Nigeria  analysts to build up a few strategies or scientific model on the most proficient method to talker the rate at which the  populaces of Nigeria increment.    2.4 CHALLENGES FACED BY NIGERIA RESEARCHER IN TERMS OF INADEQUATE RESEARCH  EQUIPMENT AND QUALITY EDUCATION    Human activities constitute the greatest threats to human survival today in the world. Though these activities vary  along socio-cultural line, the greatest problem seems to be the threat to the natural resources. While fossil fuels and  greenhouse gas emissions may constitute the greatest challenge to the industrial nations, the sub-Saharan African  countries face the problem of deforestation (felling of logs) and environmental hazard caused by the activities of the  individuals. There is also the problem of CO2 (acid rain) whose effects are felt everywhere since it is climate-related  [20]. Developing countries are more prone to CO2 since they lack the means to prevent its effects on the region. The  felling of logs is an avoidable act if the people have had access to a climate-friendly source of energy; poverty does  not allow the people to seek an alternative source of energy. No doubt poverty contributes more to how the people  cause harm to the environment.   The United Nations set the Millennium Development Goals to tackle the problems of poverty, hunger etc. especially  in the developing countries. It was assumed that by 2015 most countries in the developing world would have  minimized the effects of famine, drought, poverty, hunger, HIV/AIDS and others in their environments. Most of  these countries managed to achieve marginal results in reducing the effects of famine, drought, poverty, hunger, and  HIV/AIDS; the need to consolidate on these marginal results must have informed the creation of sustainable  development goals with 17 items and a focus on the eradication of poverty and hunger by 2030. Because of the  importance of achieving the goals, the United Nations decided to declare a Decade for Education for Sustainable  Development (DESD). Its main focus is to inculcate in individuals such a critical reflection on actions which impact  negatively on the earth's resources. According to UNESCO [21] ESD â€œis a vision of education that seeks to balance  human and economic well-being with cultural traditions and respect for the earth's natural resources.â€� What is at  stake is how to achieve human well-being without depleting the source of such well-being.    In a paper by American Association of College of Teacher Education (AACTE) [22] entitled: set 21st Century  Information and in Educator Training, the authors argue that most assessment of students in the developing world  are designed to measure students' capability to recall distinct facts using multiple-choice examinations rather than to  measure a student's capability to engage in and comprehensive complex intellectual and problems resolving tasks.  Markovic [23] too confesses that in traditional education students are passive participants on all the education levels.  Further to say that the knowledge students learnt in the course of their education process has regularly turned out not  to be truly applicable or rather inadequate to meet the current requirements of critical education. Still in traditional  education, especially in Nigerian school system, some elements of African culture are noticeable. Marinho [24] says  â€œstudents expected to speak only when spoken to, and student's participation in dialogue, discussion, debate or  reflection is discouraged.â€� It is simply a product of cultural conflict; young people are hardly allowed to engage  elders in debates as this would be regarded as disrespectful in every respect. For instance, culture does not permit a  young person to correct an elder when the elder does something wrong, e.g. felling of logs in the wood. Because   O.S.I.

For instance, culture does not permit a  young person to correct an elder when the elder does something wrong, e.g. felling of logs in the wood. Because  402 O.S.I. Fayomi  et al. / Energy Procedia 157 (2019) 393â€“40410 Author name / Energy Procedia 00 (2018) 000â€“000  ignorance and superstition pervade the local communities, it may be necessary to make such a correction for the  purpose of sustainability, but indeed, African culture sometimes frowns at it. The only condition the young person  can make the correction is for him/her to act with reasonable caution in his/her choice of words.    As reported by American Association of College of Teacher Education (AACTE) [22] some of the competencies  students required are being able to â€œadapt to change, be flexible, manage goals and time, work independently, be  self-directed, work effectively in diverâ€™s teams, manage projects and produce results, guide and lead others and be  responsible to othersâ€�. Ananiadou and Magdalena [25], therefore, stress that the 21 century skills and competencies  are â€œthose skills and competencies young people will be required to have in order to be effective workers and  citizens in the knowledge societyâ€�. Besides, students should be able to think critically and make good decisions on  their own lifestyles, values, and behaviour for sustainable reason.    The problem of poor access to quality education by Nigerian children may stall their ambition to achieve meaningful  lifestyles and well-being [20], [26]. The problem also spilled into how the country prepares to meet the SDGs. Thus,  poor access to quality education is likely to prevent the country from participating in the current global drive to  achieve the sustainable development goals. This is one of the problems the country is facing today. Verspoor [27]  uses Cameroon, Kenya and Niger to illustrate his point while explaining the problem of poor access to education in  Africa. According to him, no children from the poorest income quintile, in these countries, are enrolled in tertiary  institutions, yet Berthelem (as cited in Verspoor, [27]) believes that crossing the human capital threshold and  moving to higher levels of economic performance will require 'ambitious investment in education'. Berthelem's  study seems to suggest that countries in Africa affected by poor budgetary allocation to education risk further  deprivation in human capital development [28].    The issue of quality education in sustainable development program entails providing adequate learning experience  for the young people [29]. UNESCO [21] declared in chapter 36 of Agenda 21 four goals of education to be  provided.   ï�¶ To advance and enhance the nature of instruction to refocus long lasting training on information, abilities  and qualities which the nationals need to enhance the nature of their life.   ï�¶ To reorient the current training programs from essential to college to fill in as a vehicle of learning,  thought examples and qualities expected to assemble a reasonable world.   ï�¶ To rise open mindfulness and comprehension of the idea of manageable improvement to create  illuminate, dynamic and dependable citizenship locally, broadly and globally.  ï�¶ To train the work force - current technical and vocational education involving directors and workers â€“ to  enable them to adopt sustainable methods of manufacture and Consumption    In order to promote the four goals, Nigeria may have to adopt a policy reform option.  The basic policy reform  option may be to make teacher education rigorous enough to emphasize adequate knowledge of the content area and  mastery of teaching methods. The emphasis should be to prepare students adequately for the contemporary  challenges in the global community, and to make the teaching of fundamental skills and competencies teacher's  teaching/learning paradigm [30-42].    Hypothetical ideas of systems in training as per systems constitute another social morphology in the public arena,  where overwhelming capacities and procedures are progressively composed around systems. These systems are  upgraded through new data innovations that give the material premise to their development all through the whole  social structure. Castells [30] conceptualizes the idea of 'arrange' as an exceedingly powerful, open framework  comprising of hubs and streams.    3. CONCLUSION    This paper as successfully reviewed the effects of researchers in achieving the sustainable development goals and  the challenges researchers faced in other to meet up this SDGS demand. From this review it is more clearing that  developing country cannot meet up this sustainable development goals without the researchers, so the government   Author name / EnergyProcedia 00 (2018) 000â€“000 11  need to acknowledge the worthy and the role of the researchers in Nigeria and their challenges faced, from this  study, the conclusion drawn and the recommendation are as follows  ï�¶ The government need to make good policy that will aimed the training of researchers to developed good  and quality research skills  ï�¶ Provide good equipment and technology for researchers to use in carrying out their research duties  ï�¶ Provide all necessary funding for research in this country to be successful.

Hypothetical ideas of systems in training as per systems constitute another social morphology in the public arena,  where overwhelming capacities and procedures are progressively composed around systems. These systems are  upgraded through new data innovations that give the material premise to their development all through the whole  social structure. Castells [30] conceptualizes the idea of 'arrange' as an exceedingly powerful, open framework  comprising of hubs and streams.    3. CONCLUSION    This paper as successfully reviewed the effects of researchers in achieving the sustainable development goals and  the challenges researchers faced in other to meet up this SDGS demand. From this review it is more clearing that  developing country cannot meet up this sustainable development goals without the researchers, so the government   Author name / EnergyProcedia 00 (2018) 000â€“000 11  need to acknowledge the worthy and the role of the researchers in Nigeria and their challenges faced, from this  study, the conclusion drawn and the recommendation are as follows  ï�¶ The government need to make good policy that will aimed the training of researchers to developed good  and quality research skills  ï�¶ Provide good equipment and technology for researchers to use in carrying out their research duties  ï�¶ Provide all necessary funding for research in this country to be successful.

The roles of researcher in the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals cannot be taking for granted. This paper has reviewed some aspects of the challenges faced by researcher in terms of policies making, funds, populations, inadequate research equipment and quality education. The outcome of this study shows that the greatest limitations affecting researchers from development and survival in Nigeria to meet up the sustainable development goals are lack of funding supports, poor organization, fraud, absence of training for gaining knowledge, poor infrastructure, poor technology and low request for product and services. When all this are put in place this will help the researchers to carry out effective research on how Nigeria can meet the demand for the SDGS.
