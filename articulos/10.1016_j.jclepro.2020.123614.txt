                  This research demonstrates a novel method to communicate in Higher Education and raise awareness of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and particularly of Sustainable Development Goals, a vital step in accelerating action for their fulfillment. Students of the Faculty of Engineering during the “Ecology” course participated in groups in ten Ecological Projects covering a wide range of fields. These creative and experimental Ecological Projects focused on Sustainable Development Goals 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15 were inspired by Environmental science and Ecology. Their presentation occurred as event for the World Environment Day and the European Sustainable Development Week in the central square of the capital city of a region, which is a lignite mining region and the country’s energy heart. The Ecological Projects’ overall impacts were investigated through questionnaires completed by the participating students. Various statistical techniques were conducted. Nineteen questions establish as a measurement tool in its final form the questionnaire, whose Cronbach’s alpha is 0.895 indicating that an excellent reliability was estimated. The central tendency of the responses in Questions such as Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6, Q8, Q10, Q14, Q15, Q16, Q17, Q18, Q19 indicates that Ecological Projects had enough impact on students’ cognitive, social and moral level. The Ecological Projects’ implementation and presentation sufficiently raised awareness of the Sustainable Development Goals. In three questions were detected statistically significant differences between the genders. Finally, according to the questionnaire responses, pairs of questions with moderate or strong monotonic association between them are presented too.

Keywords Ecology  Sustainable development goals  Ecological projects  Education  2030 agenda    1 Introduction Sustainable development “is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.”  (UN. Secretary-General and World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987 ). In September 2015, 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) linked with 169 targets demonstrated the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. A new broad and global policy Agenda. Never previously the leaders of the world promised common action and effort across such an agenda (UN. General Assembly, 2015 ). Nevertheless, according to a recent report, public awareness of the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda seems to be modest especially at the community levels in spite of an amount of actions undertaken at entire levels (UN. Secretary-General, 2019 ). Except for that, one of the key messages of the SDG Summit 2019 is that governments cannot do it on their own and they are reaching out to build new collaborations with civil society, scientific community etc. (President of the UN. General Assembly, 2019 ). The awareness of the citizens functions as a prerequisite to formulate policy preferences and apply pressure on policymakers (Otto et al., 2019 ). Also, the public sector has to be sustainable to influence and other sectors improving their performance too (Figueira et al., 2018 ). The current study highlights the following issues that deserve policy action for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. One such issue is raising awareness of the SDGs in higher education. This is a focal point as the Universities disseminate knowledge and research inspiration to young people. As far as we know from the current literature there is a gap in raising awareness of the SDGs through a creative, practical and appealing way among the University students. An other issue which deserves policy action is the incentivizing of such initiatives that finally proved to be effective. For that reason, it is important the assessment on how effectively such practical actions raised awareness of the SDGs among the University students. According to literature (Tchamyou, 2020 ), in addition to the investment in technologies which are high-end, the creation as well as the dissemination of knowledge are vital too via universities and institutes of research in a variety of disciplines and fields. The research question of the present study is how the higher Education could raise awareness of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and particularly of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through specific applicable and appealing actions. The related aim of the current research is to raise awareness of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in higher Education through specific Ecological Projects (which are focused especially on SDGs 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15). One more related aim is to investigate through questionnaires and also to highlight the impact of these ten Ecological Projects on University students. Raising awareness of the SDGs in Universities is crucial not only for their implementation but also for future innovations as the SDGs could be a basis of inspiration and motivation for the young scientists in search for solutions. In the present study it is examined the process of communication, the feeling of active citizenship, the personal interest, signs of communication leadership, the feeling of community, connection’s aspects, the cultivation of ethos, etc. The present research compared to the other studies is innovative as it implements in an appealing and applicable way a wide range of creative and experimental Ecological Projects focused on SDGs, in a Faculty of Engineering presenting these in city’s central square too. These Ecological Projects’ implementation and presentation sufficiently raised awareness of the Sustainable Development Goals. The Ecological Projects combined with questionnaire’s profound and thoughtful questions can incite relevant initiatives too. Thus, this new applicable and appealing approach can inspire similar actions in the higher Education in order to raise awareness of the Sustainable Development Goals by simplifying experimental processes, popularizing the scientific knowledge and preserving at the same time its scientific value.  2 Literature review Sustainable development and the protection of the environment are difficult to be achieved without three principal elements. These elements are transparency, accountability and the broader public participation combined with information flow (Chemutai, 2009 ; Asongu et al., 2018 ). The third element needs the availability of a tool of communication, which enables the spread of knowledge, in order the deficiencies of information/knowledge that are related to the deterioration of the environment to be reduced (Asongu et al., 2018 ). Higher Education Institutions are starting to create to a greater extent systematic changes for sustainability by the reorientation of their education, operations, research and community activities at the same time or more often a subset thereof (Wals, 2014 ). The University could be the venue of value transition acting coordinately on two paths. By applying sustainability education and by carrying out what it preaches (Sonetti et al., 2019 ). As an educational institution, the University dedicated to respect human person and to protect and foster human rights should encourage a sustainability culture, that contributes to the integral human development (Silvia et al., 2018 ). Sonetti et al. (2019)  outline the framework within which universities can with collaboration contribute to trigger values of sustainability, behavior and attitudes in future societies. Education is closely engaged with other SDGs, and particularly education is vital in order almost all SDGs to be accomplished and other aspects of SDGs exert positive impacts on education (Asongu et al., 2019 ). Education for sustainable development and in particular implementing SDGs in the higher education could be a chance in order to establish synergies between the departments of University, between the University and the society and between degrees (Silvia et al., 2018 ). Developments in higher education in achieving the SDGs have reviewed by Moon et al. (2018) . Higher education institutions’ governance is not entirely committed to the achievement of the SDGs (Moon et al., 2018 ). Khalili et al. (2015)  propose a methodology through which higher education’s leaders could assess the need and the urgency for the design of training programs assisting with developing human capital required to support Sustainable Development. The study of Fuertes-Camacho et al. (2019)  seeks to apply a universal and systematic way in resolving socio-environmental problems and in examining whether education for sustainable development assists in developing and supporting actions which promote sustainable development. There is a unique chance to combine the course content with SDGs and also may the Institutions of the Higher Education use new learning methods and approaches (Leal Filho et al., 2019 ). Globally, the higher education enrolment has been steadily increasing (Owens, 2017 ). Additionally, as higher education stimulates and accelerates innovative and critical thinking, focusing on higher education for SDGs could be integrated even more the SDGs in research methodologies and consequently their implementation in future projects. According to scientific literature (Leal Filho et al., 2019 ), the Institutions of the Higher Education should be more energetic in engaging the community of the students in committing to and in taking action in order to support the SDGs. According to the Global Sustainable Development Report 2019 (Independent Group of Scientists appointed by the Secretary-General, 2019 ), enhanced education for sustainable development required to take place in schools and inside adult population too at large to expand the challenges’ awareness as well as the information’s level about how to cope with them. According to scientific literature (Disterheft et al., 2013 ) the Education for Sustainable Development and the science of the sustainability shape the basis for sustainability research in higher education and could be seen as a path for transition.  3 Methods 3.1 Study area The presentation of the ecological projects took place in the city of Kozani in northwest Greece and particularly in the city’s center, at the central square (Nikis Square ). Kozani is the capital of the administrative region of Western Macedonia, which is Greece’s energy heart since in this region is produced the largest amount of the country’s electricity. Raising awareness for the SDGs in such a lignite mining region is crucial for a just transition in low-carbon economies looking forward to reach climate neutrality by 2050. Initially, the initiative was taken by the Instructor of the “Ecology ” course in the 4th semester of the Department of Chemical Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Western Macedonia (According to Greek legislation (L. 4610/2019) the Department of Environmental Engineering renamed Department of Chemical Engineering). The design and preparation process of the ecological projects lasted 6 months before the beginning of the course. Also, considerable emphasis was placed on the pedagogical approach throughout the design and implementation of the ecological projects.  3.2 Ecological projects During the “Ecology ” course and after detailed presentations by the instructor, the 44 students in order to participate chose by themselves and according to their interests, one of the following 10 ecological projects (and thus forming 10 groups most of them consisting of 4–5 students).1. “The 17 Sustainable Development Goals”.  The students in this key ecological project informed the public audience in the Central square about all the Sustainable Development Goals. In parallel, they played with the citizens the board game for the Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations, 2017 ), while they gave directions to the public audience about the specific SDGs that the rest ecological projects are focused on. In addition, they presented a table maquette representing in general view the contrast between the current lignite mining region and the desirable greener transition to the Sustainable Development gradually through the time.  2. “Ocean acidification”.  This ecological project focused especially on the SDG 13 (Climate action ) and SDG 14 (Life below water ). In short, the students informed the public audience about the additional consequences of the carbon dioxide, a crucial greenhouse gas, which as it is produced by the burning of fossil fuels it is released not only in the atmosphere but also it is absorbed by the ocean. Thus, the ocean becoming more acidic causes harm to the life of the ocean. The above process was demonstrated with simple materials (e.g. soda, vinegar, water, pH indicator, conical flask and beakers) in front of the Central Square’s passers-by. The popularization and the consolidation of a such global threat to marine ecosystems is very important especially for the lignite mining region of Western Macedonia, the only Greek region which is not surrounded by sea.  3. “Ecological Engineering-Ecosystem restoration after Forest Fire”.  This ecological project focused specially on the SDG 13 (Climate action ) and SDG 15 (Life on land ). Briefly, the students informed the citizens in Central Square about the erosion and the flood control techniques after forest fires. They explained according to scientific literature (Karetsos et al., 2014 ) the front line measures that should be applied in the burned area to retain the soil and support the seed germination and the second line measures that take place in the hydrographic network. In a table maquette it was demonstrated a combination of the post-fire projects such as the log erosion barriers, the wooden dams and the implementation of the hydroseeding technique (seeds, mulch, adhesive substance, jute geotextile etc.). Generally, in this lignite mining region restoration processes are crucial for the post-lignite era too.  4. “Dendrochronology”.  This ecological project focused especially on the SDG 4 (Quality education ) and SDG 15 (Life on land ). In short, the students trained the public audience how to identify the trees’ age. With simple materials (magnifying lens, wood discs etc.) wood discs of coniferous (i.e., Pinus nigra ) and broad-leaved (i.e., Quercus  spp.) tree species were analyzed (tree-rings, sapwood and heartwood area etc.) by students and citizens. Depending on tree ring analysis the citizens were educated to calculate the tree’s age and were informed about how this procedure can offer some clues about the local climate. Also, the students informed citizens about the scientific tools in dendrochronology’s field procedure (e.g. increment borer). Finally, the students provided information about the laboratory’s procedure of measuring the width of annual rings (i.e. through laboratory’s stereomicroscope).  5. “Bee hotel”.  This ecological project focused particularly on the SDG 15 (Life on land ). In short, the students informed the citizens about the importance of pollinators for the ecosystems (e.g. pollen transport and plant reproduction etc.). They emphasized on the need to conserve the wild bees’ natural habitats and also to increase their habitats especially in the urban environments where there is absence. The students presented a wooden bee hotel consisted of 5 hexagons. The students filled up each hexagon with materials (i.e. bamboo canes, drilled wood logs with small holes, etc.) in order to be as much as possible suitable for several wild bee species (i.e. mason bees, bumble bees, etc.). According to European Commission (2018)  there is a considerable decrease in the diversity and occurrence of the European wild insect pollinators, involving the wild bees too. In addition, the significance of pollinators is highlighted and their contribution to achieving specific SDGs is recognized by the Convention on Biological Diversity (Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, 2016 ; European Commission, 2018 ). The students informed also the citizens that about 1 million plant and animal species are threatened with extinction according to the findings of the recent report of IPBES (2019) , which also mentions that local decrease of insect populations (e.g. wild bees) has frequently been reported.  6. “The greenhouse effect”.  This ecological project focused especially on the SDG 12 (Responsible consumption and production ) and SDG 13 (Climate action ). Briefly, the students informed the public audience about the greenhouse effect. The students explained how specific human activities (e.g. burning of fossil fuels, deforestation etc.) increase greenhouse gases (e.g. carbon dioxide, methane etc.), enhance the greenhouse effect and cause global warming. According to IPCC (2018) , the activities of humans are estimated to have result in about 1.0 °C of global warming above the pre-industrial levels. The students informed with simple materials (e.g. candle, soda, vinegar, conical flask and bakers etc.) the passers-by about the properties of carbon dioxide and the global warming. The simplification and popularization of the scientific knowledge is vital especially for the young people growing up in a such lignite mining region of Western Macedonia. In order to limit global warming to bellow 2.0 °C, emissions of CO2  are projected to decrease approximately 25% by 2030 in most pathways (IPCC, 2018 ).  7. “Microplastics”.  This ecological project focused especially on the SDG 15 (Life on land ), SDG 14 (Life below water ) and SDG 3 (Good health and well-being ). Shortly, the students explained to citizens the definition of microplastics and the potential sources that microplastics are originated from. Particularly, they focused on marine and terrestrial ecosystems as well as on living organisms in which particles of microplastics have been detected. The scientific literature (Schwabl et al., 2019 ) provides proofs for the microplastics’ presence in human stool. In the ecological project’s practical part the students presented particles of plastic with very small dimensions (e.g. microbeads etc.) which can be found in daily use products. Also, they presented alternative bio-based solutions for several single-use plastics. Finally, they informed the citizens about the European Commission’s proposal for the recent Directive (EU) 2019/904  which applies to specific single-use plastic products restrictions on placing on the market.  8. “Eco-walk on suspension bridges on trees”.  This ecological project focused on the SDG 15 (Life on land ) and SDG 3 (Good health and well-being ). Briefly, the students informed the public audience about the contribution of a forest walk to the mood and health. In a table maquette it was demonstrated an adventurous walk, specifically an eco-walk on bridges suspended from trees aesthetically compatible with the forest landscape. Also, they gave emphasis on the benefits of ecotourism on the Sustainable Development especially of the forest mountainous areas. Worldwide there are ecotourism attractions offering the exceptional experience of walking above the forest floor from one tree to another having a panoramic view of the forest landscape’s, as for example the Capilano Suspension Bridge Park (www.capbridge.com ) in Canada, the Redwoods Treewalk (www.treewalk.co.nz ) in New Zealand etc.  9. “Renewable Energy Sources and Agriculture: Solar power and drip irrigation systems”.  This ecological project focused on the SDG 13 (Climate action ) and SDG 7 (Affordable and clean energy ). The students informed the citizens about the Renewable Energy Sources emphasizing on the solar power. Also, they informed them about the advantages of drip irrigation systems in agriculture (e.g. water efficiency etc.). These were combined in a small scale demonstration on a table for the ecological project’s practical part. For this demonstration several materials were used such as a small solar panel (12W/12V), a charge controller (5A/12V), a deep cycle battery (9Ah/12V), a submersible water pump (12V), a small open top water tank, a short mainline tubing with 2 pressure compensating emitters, and 2 pots with plant seedlings. Thus in a small scale these plant seedlings were watered by this drip irrigation system powered by solar power in front of the passers-by in the city’s central square.  10. “Photographic exhibition entitled: The diffusion of the basic colors (Red, Yellow, Blue) in the nature”.  This ecological project focused on the SDG 15 (Life on land ) and SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation ). Briefly, the students approached artistically the nature’s aspects by taking photographs depending on the diffusion of the basic colors with a symbolic sense too. The basic colors gave the opportunity to the students to focus on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Especially due to blue color in topic, the quality and quantity of the water of the natural resources was emerged at the photos. Eleven photos, the most representative ones, were chosen and exhibited in front of the passers-by.    The above 10 ecological projects covered a wide range of interesting topics and thus all groups (4–5 students in each group) were shaped according to the students’ interests. Each ecological project combined the theoretical and applied aspect. Thus the students and the passers-by acquired the knowledge through an experiential process. All the materials for each ecological project provided by the Instructor of the “Ecology” course, who since the beginning of the course continuously supervised and supported each group separately. At the end of the semester the students presented the ecological projects under the general title “ECOnstructive activities in the town for the World Environment Day and the European Sustainable Development Week ” at the central square of Kozani in Greece, on Wednesday, 5 June 2019, at 6–9:30pm (Fig. 1  ). The event was uploaded onto the website of ESDW-European Sustainable Development Week (2019)  as well as onto the University’s website (University of Western Macedonia, 2019 ).  3.3 Questionnaires One week after the event took place, 39 of these 42 students who were participated in this final presentation in the Central square completed each one an anonymously questionnaire in the University’s auditorium. Before the completion of the questionnaire all the students were asked to answer with absolute sincerity. Thus, this motivation for completing the questionnaires with anonymity and absolute honesty contributed to the actual opinions’ measurement of the students. The questionnaire had the following two parts, the introductory and the main part. The introductory part had a small introduction about the scope of this questionnaire, also about the absolute confidentiality and the use of the answers only for research purposes. This introductory part had also 3 closed-ended questions in order to depict the student’s basic profile. These questions were about the gender (Male/Female), the age (18–30) and the place, where they grew up (one of the 13 administrative regions of Greece). The main part of the questionnaire consisted of 29 likert scale questions. For all these 29 questions it was used the same 5-point Likert scale responses, where “Not at all ” is 1, “A little ” is 2, “Moderately ” is 3, “Sufficiently ” is 4, and “A lot” is 5. Thus the codification of the answers was achieved. At this point, it should be clarified that the word “Sufficiently ” is the english translation of the greek word “Αρκετά ”. Further details are provided by the following dictionaries too. The entry “Αρκετά ” which is adverb means “enough , sufficiently , amply , adequately”  (Georgacas, 2005 ). The entry “Sufficiently ” is defined as “To an adequate degree; enough. ” (Oxford University Press, 2020 ). The questions’ content was shaped in order to investigate the impact of ecological projects on the fourth semester’s students at cognitive, social and moral levels, focusing on the role of higher education in raising students and community’s awareness for the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.  3.4 Statistical analysis Various statistical techniques were conducted for the data analysis process. In order to check the internal consistency of the questionnaire the Cronbach’s alpha was used through the reliability analysis process. According to literature (Tavakol and Dennick, 2011 ), the Cronbach’s alpha is the most broadly used measurement of reliability and is important for the evaluation of questionnaires. During the reliability analysis process, the questions which did not meet in overall the appropriate prerequisites were excluded. After this purification process, the statistical analysis continued with the frequencies. Percentages of responses were calculated for each one of all the questions, which consisted of 5-point Likert scale responses. Furthermore, the median was used as measure of the central tendency. According to the literature (Wright, 1994 ), for ordinal data the statistically appropriate measure of the central tendency is the median. As specified by Norušis (2011)  the variables whose values indicate only order or ranking are measured in ordinal scale. The measurement scale of the variable is ordinal, in case of the variable is qualitative and in order (Chalikias et al., 2015 ). In the present questionnaire’s main part, responses to the likert scale questions measured in ordinal scale, as it was used the 5-point Likert scale responses. According to Norušis (2011) , if summarizing a variable whose values can be classified from the smallest to the largest, the median is more useful measure of central tendency. After this basic part of statistical analysis several nonparametric tests were followed. According to Norušis (2011) , when analyzing data especially from small samples then processes like nonparametric tests are needed. According to Parker et al. (2002) , nonparametric methods are frequently used for Likert scale data analysis as it is considered that ordinal scale data are produced by Likert scale. Also, having a 5-level ordinal scale it could be easy, assumptions of normality related to parametric hypothesis tests to be violated (Parker et al., 2002 ). In the present study the Mann-Whitney U  test was used in each question, which consisted of 5-point Likert scale responses, for investigating the difference between the genders. Finally, the Spearman’s rank-order correlation was used to investigate the correlation between all possible pairs of questions, which consisted of 5-point Likert scale responses. Statistical analysis has been performed with the software IBM® SPSS® Statistics, Version 24, © (IBM Corp. 2016 ).   4 Results 4.1 Impacts of ecological projects As described above, to guarantee reliability 19 questions were eventually included and these are discussed here. These 19 questions (Table 1  ), which establish the questionnaire as a measurement tool in its final form, passed the appropriate checks in the reliability analysis process. Thus, nineteen questions establish as a measurement tool in its final form the questionnaire, whose Cronbach’s alpha is 0.895 indicating that an excellent reliability was estimated. According to the literature (Tavakol and Dennick, 2011 ), the acceptable values for the Cronbach’s alpha are 0.70–0.95. However a maximum value of 0.90 for alpha is recommended because a high alpha value over 0.90 may suggest redundancies and indicate that the length of the test should be shortened. On the other hand, a low alpha emerges if specific assumptions aren’t met (Tavakol and Dennick, 2011 ). Additionally in the reliability analysis process of the present study, the Mean Inter-Item Correlations is 0.322 which is an acceptable value. According to the literature (Piedmont, 2014 ), the average inter-item correlation ideally should be 0.20–0.40. Inter-item correlations refer to matters associating with how nicely the tool measures some construct as for example its internal consistency (Piedmont, 2014 ; Cronbach, 1951 ). The general profile of these 39 students who participated in the final presentation in the Central square and also completed after the anonymously questionnaire is provided below. As regards their gender, 61.5% (24 students) were males, while 38.5% (15 students) were females. This ratio is usual for a Department which belongs to a Faculty of Engineering. As regards their age, 51.3% (20 students) were 20 years old. Also, 23.1% (9 students) were 19 years old and 20.5% (8 students) were 21 years old. Finally, 5.1% (2 students) were 22 years old. The above ages reflect the very sensitive period of these young students who seemingly can acquire scientific knowledge and new skills through experience but also to transmit their own shaped notions. Concerning the places, namely the 13 administrative regions of Greece that the students grew up in, 53.8% (21 students) grew up in Central Macedonia . Also, 15.4% (6 students) grew up in Western Macedonia  and 10.3% (4 students) grew up in Epirus . Finally, 5.1% (2 students) grew up in Attica , 5.1% (2 students) grew up in Eastern Macedonia and Thrace , 5.1% (2 students) grew up in Peloponnese  and 5.1% (2 students) grew up in Thessaly . After the general profile of the students, their responses over the questions follows (Table 2  ). Initially and as regards the question Q1 “Did the implementation of the practical part (e.g. experiment, construction etc.) of the ecological project play a role in consolidating better its content? ” the median, which measures the central tendency of the responses was 5 which stands for “A lot ”. Particularly, 53.85% (21 students) stated “A lot”, 25.64% stated “Sufficiently ”, 17.95% stated “Moderately ”, 2.56% stated “A little ”, while no student stated “Not at all ”. Next question is Q2 “During all the presentation of the ecological project in the Central square, within the event’s framework, did you feel that the use of right arguments could persuade somebody to perceive the facts in the light of your scientific field? ”. A median of 4 which indicates “Sufficiently ” identified the central tendency of the responses. In particular, 46.15% (18 students) declared “Sufficiently ”, 33.33% declared “A lot”, 15.38% declared “Moderately ”, 5.13% declared “A little ”, while no student declared “Not at all ”.

After it follows the question Q6 “How much of your free time have you devoted to search of personal interest additional information connected with your ecological project? ”. A median of 4 which denotes “Sufficiently ” described the central tendency of the responses. Specifically, 38.46% (15 students) declared “Sufficiently ”, 28.21% declared “Moderately ”, 17.95% declared “A lot ”, 10.26% declared “A little ”, and finally 5.13% declared “Not at all ”. As regards the question Q7 “Whether would you be interested in focusing later on the more specialized academic level (e.g. graduate thesis, postgraduate thesis, etc.) to any of the specific Sustainable Development Goals on which the event was focused as a whole? ” the median, which measures the central tendency of the responses was 3 which stands for “Moderately ”. Particularly, 33.33% (13 students) stated “Sufficiently ”, 28.21% stated “Moderately ”, 23.08% stated “A little ”, 15.38% stated “A lot”, while no student declared “Not at all ”. Next question is Q8 “During all the implementation or presentation of the ecological project, to what extent did you interest to be informed from your fellow students belonged to the rest teams for the content and the Sustainable Development Goals on which they had focused their ecological projects? ” A median of 4 which indicates “Sufficiently ” identified the central tendency of the responses. In particular, 33.33% (13 students) declared “A lot”, 30.77% declared “Sufficiently ”, 23.08% declared “Moderately ”, 7.69% declared “A little ”, and finally 5.13% declared “Not at all ”. After it follows the question Q9 “During the implementation process of the ecological project of your team did you take initiatives in order obstacles to overcome with the purpose of the feeling of a common mission? ” A median of 3 which denotes “Moderately ” described the central tendency of the responses. Specifically, 35.90% (14 students) stated “Moderately ”, 25.64% stated “Sufficiently ”, 23.08% stated “A lot”, 15.38% stated “A little ”, while no student declared “Not at all ”. As regards the question Q10 “Did you inform on your own initiative relatives, friends or generally your social environment (that they are not actively involved in the event) for the framework of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals? ” the median, which measures the central tendency of the responses was 4 which stands for “Sufficiently ”. Particularly, 46.15% (18 students) declared “Sufficiently ”, 20.51% declared “Moderately ”, 17.95% declared “A lot”, 7.69% declared “A little ”, and finally 7.69% declared “Not at all ”. Next question is Q11 “Did the ecological projects and the interaction which you had with the people they influence you at level which could make you think seriously the possibility for organizing a corresponding awareness - raising activity in the future for the general public for the 17 Sustainable Development Goals? ”. A median of 3 which indicates “Moderately ” identified the central tendency of the responses. In particular, 41.03% (16 students) stated “Moderately ”, 25.64% stated “Sufficiently ”, 17.95% stated “A little ”, 12.82% stated “Not at all ”, and finally 2.56% declared “A lot”. Just underneath this current question, as a sole exception to the main part of the questionnaire’s structure (only likert scale questions consisted of 5-point Likert scale responses), the following individual subquery was set out. “In case of being organized by an Institution in your area an awareness raising activity that would focus on one and only Goal from the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, who sole Goal would you like to be that? ”. This individual subquery as a sole exception did not participate in the statistical analysis process and thus is not included in the establishment of the questionnaire as a measurement tool in its final form. Nevertheless, it makes sense as the students had the opportunity to place emphasis on one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which were provided written to them. In this subquery as was expressed, the students drew attention to one Goal without isolating it from the rest Goals. Specifically, 10.26% (4 students) declared “SDG 4: Quality education ”, a same percentage of 10.26% declared “SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth ”, also 10.26% declared “SDG 11: Sustainable cities and communities ”, and furthermore 10.26% declared “SDG 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions ”. Thereafter, 7.69% declared “SDG 2: Zero hunger ”, similarly 7.69% declared “SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure ”, also 7.69% declared “SDG 10: Reduced inequalities ”, and furthermore 7.69% declared “SDG 13: Climate action ”. Next, 5.13% declared “SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy ” and an identical percentage of 5.13% declared “SDG 14: Life below water ”. Lastly, 2.56% declared “SDG 1: No poverty ”, a same percentage of 2.56% declared “SDG 3: Good health and well-being ”, similarly 2.56% declared “SDG 5: Gender equality ”, also 2.56% declared “SDG 6: Clean water and sanitation ”, a percentage of 2.56% declared “SDG 12: Responsible consumption and production ”, also 2.56% declared “SDG 15: Life on land ”, and finally 2.56% declared “SDG 17: Partnerships for the goals ”. After it follows the question Q12 “Did you use one or any other of the social networks (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram e.t.c.) where you maintain an account in order to promote anything relevant with the event “ECOnstructive activities in the town for the World Environment Day and the European Sustainable Development Week”?  ”. A median of 3 which denotes “Moderately ” described the central tendency of the responses. Specifically, 23.08% (9 students) stated “Not at all ”, 20.51% stated “A little ”, 20.51% stated “Sufficiently ”, 17.95% stated “Moderately ”, and finally 17.95% stated “A lot”. In this question, the Mann-Whitney U  test resulted in statistically significant differences (p = 0.029, Asymp. Sig. (2-tailed)) between males (24 students) and females (15 students). Through this nonparametric test it emerged that female ranks (mean rank = 24.93, Mann-Whitney U  test) were higher than these of males (mean rank = 16.92, Mann-Whitney U  test). At this point, the responses for each gender in this question are provided separately. As regards the males, a median of 2.5 which indicates an intermediate state between “Moderately ” and “A little ” described the central tendency of the responses. In particular, 33.33% (8 male students) stated “Not at all ”, 25% stated “Moderately ”, 16.67% stated “A little ”, 16,67% stated “Sufficiently ”, and finally 8.33% stated “A lot”. While, as regards the females a median of 4 which denotes “Sufficiently ” described the central tendency of the responses. Specifically, 33.33% (5 female students) declared “A lot”, 26.67% declared “Sufficiently ”, 26.67% declared “A little ”, 6.67% declared “Moderately ”, and finally 6.67% declared “Not at all ”. As regards the next question Q13 “In your engagement with the ecological project and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals did you search on one of the social networks (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram e.t.c.) for an official foundation or person who is related directly or indirectly with these Goals (for example on Twitter: @GlobalGoalsUN, @antonioguterres, or for example on Facebook: @EuropeanSustainableDevelopmentWeek @unenvironment e.t.c.)?  ”, the median which measures the central tendency of the responses was 2 which stands for “A little ”. Particularly, 46.15% (18 students) stated “Not at all ”, 23.08% stated “Sufficiently ”, 17.95% stated “A little ”, 10.26% “Moderately ”, and finally 2.56% stated “A lot”.

At this point, the responses for each gender in this question are provided separately. As regards the males, a median of 4 which indicates “Sufficiently ”, described the central tendency of the responses. In particular, 45.83% (11 male students) stated “Sufficiently ”, 25% stated “A lot ”, 12.50% stated “Moderately ”, 8.33% stated “A little ” and finally 8.33% stated “Not at all ”. While, as regards the females a median of 5 which denotes “A lot ” described the central tendency of the responses. Specifically, 53.33% (8 female students) declared “A lot ”, 40% declared “Sufficiently ”, 6.67% declared “Moderately ”, while no female student declared “A little ” and also no female student declared “Not at all ”. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (rs ) was calculated for each possible pair of questions. The monotonic relationships between the questionnaire answers were explored. Consequently, and according to the questionnaire responses, pairs of questions with moderate or strong monotonic association between them are presented below. According to the questionnaire responses, there is a statistically significant (p = 0.000) positive and strong (rs  = 0.716) monotonic relationship between the question Q17 and the question Q15. This strong correlation depicts the close perception between the feeling of the global community and the sense of active citizenship for the majority of the students. The question Q15 has a statistically significant (p = 0.000) positive and moderate (rs  = 0.536) monotonic association with the question Q4. This moderate correlation indicates that for the majority of the students through the implementation and presentation of the ecological projects there is a close view between the sense that they are part of the global community and the enhancement of the communication skills. The question Q4 has also a statistically significant (p = 0.000) positive and moderate (rs  = 0.561) monotonic relationship with the question Q3. This moderate correlation depicts that during the ecological projects’ implementation and presentation, for the majority of the students there is a close view between the sense of active citizenship and the enhancement of the communication skills. In addition, the question Q4 has a statistically significant (p = 0.000) positive and moderate (rs  = 0.545) monotonic association with the question Q1. This moderate correlation depicts that there were elements of communication e.g. the human communication or the communication of the knowledge, which were promoted through the implementation of the ecological projects. There is a statistically significant (p = 0.000) positive and moderate (rs  = 0.623) monotonic relationship between the question Q19 and the question Q16. This moderate correlation indicates that for the majority of students there is a close perception between the sense of belonging to the global community through this action for the SDGs and the nurturing through the SDGs of a new global ethos of sustainable development. It was emerged a statistically significant (p = 0.000) positive and moderate (rs  = 0.540) monotonic association between the question Q9 and the question Q6. This moderate correlation indicates that the implementation process of the ecological projects evolved skills of communication leadership as well as the personal interest for almost the majority of the students. Finally, it came out a statistically significant (p = 0.000) positive and moderate (rs  = 0.536) monotonic relationship between the question Q7 and the question Q5. This moderate correlation depicts the close perception between the personal interest of almost the majority of the students in focusing on specific SDGs during their future scientific investigations and the aspects of active citizenship like the sense, which the majority of students felt, for responsible participation in the society for the common good.   5 Discussion 5.1 Impacts of ecological projects As regards the results of the question Q1, it is emerged the importance of the Ecological Project’s creative part in communicating its content to the University students. According to Political declaration of the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development Convened under the Auspices of the General Assembly in 2019, it is promised the promotion of attempts in communicating the 2030 Agenda to the public of the world to raise awareness and motivate speeding up action (UN. High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development Convened under the Auspices of the General Assembly and UN. General Assembly, 2019 ). Concerning the results of the question Q2, since most of the students acknowledged that reasoning during their social interaction can result in persuasion then this process shapes their ethos. This experience contributes to the development of their scientific confidence too. According to the Global Sustainable Development Report 2019 (Independent Group of Scientists appointed by the Secretary-General, 2019 ), it needs intentional transformations in order the 2030 Agenda to be achieved. The implementation needs societal consensus. There are challenges which demand communications attempts for raising awareness (Independent Group of Scientists appointed by the Secretary-General, 2019 ). Considering the results of the question Q3, as most of students recognized that several of their aspects were involved during the process, this cultivates active citizenship’s characteristics like responsibility, volunteering, and energy for creation which can accelerates processes. According to a recent report, producing awareness about SDGs is necessary for shifting mindsets and incite creative action from entire society’s levels (UN. Secretary-General, 2019 ). As regards the results of the question Q4, the answers reveal that most of the students enhanced their soft skills. Activating such personal traits for harmonic and valuable communication, especially in a society with individualistic signs, could enhance the effective cooperation for SDGs achievement. Concerning the results of the question Q5, aspects of active citizenship are reflected in the students’ answers. Such initiatives can develop the sense of offering and contribute to responsible and selfless concern for the broader community. According to Owens (2017) , higher education has a significant role to play in fulfilling the challenges of sustainable development. Nevertheless, the sector could do more than provide skills and training in advanced level. It holds the capability to associate services with communities too (Owens, 2017 ). Considering the results of the question Q6, the sum of the percentages of the responses “Sufficiently ” and “A lot ” which is 56.41% indicates that most of the students not only had personal interest in the entire process of their ecological project but also they were motivated to search for answers in queries and aspects which emerged by investigating the content. As regards the results of the question Q7, this outcome, which reveals the students’ personal interests too, is a promising sign since almost about half of the students (summing the percentages of the responses “Sufficiently ” and “A lot ” which is 48.71%) responded positively to the focus on specific SDGs during their future scientific investigations. According to the Global Sustainable Development Report 2019 (Independent Group of Scientists appointed by the Secretary-General, 2019 ), science can forward the 2030 Agenda. Science involves the scientists, the produced evidence by them and the motivations that force their research (Independent Group of Scientists appointed by the Secretary-General, 2019 ). Concerning the results of the question Q8, the majority of the answers shows the positive personal interest of the students for the rest ecological projects too. That encourages the scientific curiosity and the exchange of views and knowledge among the teams. Considering the results of the question Q9, it is encouraging that almost about half of the students (summing the percentages of the responses “Sufficiently ” and “A lot ” which is 48.71%) unfolded such communication leadership skills through this osmosis process. Focusing on the big picture of the common mission while bridging the gaps are valuable abilities for facing the global ecological challenges. As regards the results of the question Q10, it is revealed that the majority of the students communicated the SDGs to their social surroundings too. Such important initiatives, which come from raising students’ awareness, illuminate the notion of communication leadership too. According to the scientific literature (Martiskainen, 2017 ), community leadership isn’t a closely defined concept but is described also by the lines of community within it functions and community leadership can be composed of a person or a group of persons. Community leadership can assist in evolution of grassroots innovations (Martiskainen, 2017 ). Concerning the results of the question Q11, it was explored the intentions of the students to go one step further. These intensions were reflected in the central tendency of the responses. The ecological projects sowed the seed for organizing such activities and also it could be matured from the students’ side too the idea for organizing on their own such activities. Just underneath this current question, as a sole exception to the main part of the questionnaire’s structure, the individual subquery was set out. Summing up the responses of the students in total, they did not leave any of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals unselected, although in this individual subquery each one student had the chance and checked one and only Goal. That is one more important sign of the awareness raising process that achieved through the Ecological Projects. In addition, according to the scientific literature (Caeiro et al., 2020 ) particularly the SDG 4 is an additional pilot in order the sustainability at Higher Educational Institution to be applied. According to (Asongu et al., 2019 ) the SDG 4 about quality education is also associated with other SDGs as it consists the origin of specialized knowledge and awareness which are connected to sustainable management of the environment and exhaustible resources. Considering the results of the question Q12, since the social media play an essential role in the dissemination of information, greater effort should be made on the promotion of such creative events trough the social media too. In the present research it emerged that the females communicated information as regards the event through the social media more than the males. Thus, greater emphasis should be placed on males as regards their motivation in order to contribute more to the communication of such events’ content through the social media too. As regards the results of the question Q13, it can be noticed (summing the percentages of the responses “Not at all ” and “A little ” which is 64.1%) that the connection as regards the social media between the students and the basic information sources is limited. Obviously there should be a better awareness of them, but also these sources should be more digitally attractive to young people. According to Asongu and Le Roux (2017) , policies planned to increase the penetration of information and communication technology (ICT) will expand inclusive development in post-2015 agenda for sustainable development. Concerning the results of the question Q14, the findings demonstrate that students’ cooperation as well as the development of the specialized knowledge needed to accomplish the Ecological Projects in accordance with the overall framework of SDGs, assist in holistic approach and connection of the knowledge. According to the literature (Chambers, 2013 ) there will be numerous advantages obtained when interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary teams work with each other to develop subjects. According to the Global Sustainable Development Report 2019 (Independent Group of Scientists appointed by the Secretary-General, 2019 ), the worldwide engineering and scientific communities should assist more to create our societies’ future, specifically by enhancing the revealing interdisciplinary field of the science of sustainability. According to the literature (Annan-Diab and Molinari, 2017 ), the range and interconnectedness of SDGs make it obvious that experts from different fields and sectors should collaborate for delivering the goals. Issues which are multifaceted need abilities and knowledge from distinct areas in an integrated way (Annan-Diab and Molinari, 2017 ). According to Asongu and Odhiambo (2019) , it is significant to mention that inequality and poverty still constitute glaring challenges in order SDGs to be achieved in most sampled countries. Additionally, in the scientific literature (Asongu, 2016 ) it is mentioned that the eradication of poverty and the economies’ transformation by way of sustainable development are essentials of post-2015 development agenda about priority transformations. Considering the results of the question Q15, it is obvious from the responses that with this action in the city center most of the students felt part of the global community and joined their voices informing the society about ecological issues and the sustainable development goals. According to the literature (Garcia et al., 2017 ), the search for sustainable development doesn’t interest just one group of persons or just one agenda. Making ready the people for the challenges of the future demands a society with skills and knowledge and thus education is the only direction (Garcia et al., 2017 ). According to a study (Asongu et al., 2017 ), a defect that is shared to a large extent by the emphasized literature is the collective defeat to engage a variable policy with which emissions of CO2  can be decreased for the enhancement of human development and the sustainability of the environment. As regards the results of the question Q16, the majority of the students, by this local action associated with the sustainable development, felt a sense of belonging to the global community putting into practice the phrase “Think global, act local” which has inspired environmentalists. According to (Disterheft et al., 2013 ) Education for Sustainable Development and the science of sustainability besides universities, constitute vital vehicles to explore, try and develop circumstances for transformative change. According to the Global Sustainable Development Report 2019 (Independent Group of Scientists appointed by the Secretary-General, 2019 ), nowadays there are challenges which are complicated and demand communication attempts to raise awareness and cause social request for action too. Concerning the results of the question Q17, the majority of the students perceived a sense of active citizenship by taking part in preparation and presentation of this effort which was enhanced with its global visibility as it was registered in the platform of ESDW together with other thousands of initiatives too. In the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it was pledged the fostering of an ethic of global citizenship as well as shared responsibility (UN. General Assembly, 2015 ). Considering the results of the question Q18, and discussing overall this question, it can be noticed generally by summing the percentages of the responses “Sufficiently ” and “A lot ” which is 94.87% that the ecological projects had an important impact on cultivating respect for nature and the harmonious coexistence between humans and nature. Thus, such activities not only shape the ethos of the students but also illuminate the field of environmental ethics which can play an important role in the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. As regards the results of the question Q19, the responses emerge the important role that the SDGs can play too in nurturing in the long term a new global ethos of sustainable development. The combination in such Projects of as much SDGs as possible is a future challenge. Since the Projects of the present research inspired by Environmental science and Ecology focused on SDGs 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15 the embodiment of as much as possible SDGs is a future challenge. Consequently, future research could include all the SDGs. An other challenge is to incite the students to take initiatives themselves for organizing awareness - raising activities for the SDGs.  5.2 Practical implications and future research The current research reveals an innovative and effective way of raising awareness of SDGs through creative Projects inspired by Environmental science and Ecology. At the same time this study provides not only the scenario of these Projects but also a reliable questionnaire which investigates their impacts on participating students of their higher Education. Thus, this methodology could be implemented further by other University Departments worldwide. To summarize the answers of the participating students, it was revealed that the implementation and the presentation of the Ecological Projects sufficiently raised awareness of SDGs. Future research could also investigate the impacts of such Projects on the public audience during the presentation from the participating students. Future research based on the present study could stay focused on the creation of such experimental projects inspired by a variety of other science fields and SDGs. An additional future research direction includes the generation of new Ecological Projects or the design of similar practical and novel initiatives focusing on raising awareness of the SDGs. Raising awareness of SDGs in higher education matters because future research and development could be based on them. The new knowledge of this study is crystallized in the impacts of the Ecological Projects whose implementation and presentation sufficiently raised awareness of SDGs in the participating students. Such creative Projects could be one of the vehicles for the communication and the dissemination of SDGs in higher education.   6 Conclusions These 10 Ecological Projects sufficiently raised awareness of the Sustainable Development Goals in these fourth semester’s university students during the “Ecology ” course. Their impacts according to the central tendency of the students’ responses for each question are summarized as follows. The implementation of the ecological projects’ practical part contributed a lot to consolidating better its content. During the presentation the students sufficiently felt that the use of right arguments contributed to scientifically persuasion. Also, during the presentation they sufficiently felt multidimensional scientists with creative mood. The implementation process sufficiently improved the team-working skills of the students. After the event’s implementation the students sufficiently felt that they responsibly participated in the society for the common good. Also, sufficient free time was devoted by the students to searching for additional information as regards their ecological projects. The students are moderately interested in focusing on specific SDGs during their future scientific investigations. They were sufficiently interested in be informed for the content and SDGs of the ecological projects of their fellow students. They moderately took initiatives teams for overcoming obstacles, feeling the common mission. Also, the students sufficiently on their own initiative informed the relatives or generally their social environment about SDGs. The students moderately were influenced for organizing in the future a such public event for the SDGs. Furthermore, they moderately used the social networks for promoting event’s information. They searched a little on social networks for official accounts related with the Goals. The students think that the SDGs sufficiently reinforce the interdisciplinarity. The students during the action sufficiently identified themselves with the ecological concerns of the young people worldwide. They sufficiently felt that their local action can force globally the planet to sustainable development. Also, the registration of the event in an official webpage together with other pan-European actions sufficiently caused collective responsibility and happiness to the students. The ecological projects sufficiently cultivated the respect for the limits of nature. Finally, the students sufficiently believe that the 17 SDGs can instill in the societies a new global ethos of sustainable development. The present research is unique and innovative as these original Ecological Projects integrated with questionnaire’s sophisticated questions could be applicable globally in the Higher Education Institutions. The Ecological Projects’ implementation and presentation sufficiently raised awareness of the Sustainable Development Goals and that can incite similar initiatives too.
