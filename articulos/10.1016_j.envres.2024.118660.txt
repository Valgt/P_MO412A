                  The development and utilization of renewable energy (RE) is crucial for achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs). The northwest China, endowed with abundant RE sources such as wind and solar power, accounts for over 70% of the country's total resources. The assessment and utilization of RE in this region has become a critical means to achieve the SDGs, particularly SDG7. However, lack of knowledge regarding the RE potential poses a barrier to achieving high-quality energy development. Thus, through a Geographical Information System (GIS) based multi-criteria analysis, we assess the solar and wind energy potential in northwest China, quantitatively examine the energy potential and its contribution towards achieving the SDGs. Our results show that a substantial portion of RE can be harnessed in northwest China, with wind energy generation reaching up to 9.84PWh/km2/yr at 110m and 12.43 PWh/km2/yr at 140m. Concurrently, solar energy can contribute up to 15.16 PWh/km2/yr. Xinjiang province has the highest RE potential for it contains a large share of suitable area with good resource quality. The findings illustrate the contribution of northwest China towards achieving SDGs and facilitate the formulation of more targeted resource policies.

The development and utilization of renewable energy (RE) is crucial for achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs). The northwest China, endowed with abundant RE sources such as wind and solar power, accounts for over 70% of the country's total resources. The assessment and utilization of RE in this region has become a critical means to achieve the SDGs, particularly SDG7. However, lack of knowledge regarding the RE potential poses a barrier to achieving high-quality energy development. Thus, through a Geographical Information System (GIS) based multi-criteria analysis, we assess the solar and wind energy potential in northwest China, quantitatively examine the energy potential and its contribution towards achieving the SDGs. Our results show that a substantial portion of RE can be harnessed in northwest China, with wind energy generation reaching up to 9.84PWh/km2 /yr at 110m and 12.43 PWh/km2 /yr at 140m. Concurrently, solar energy can contribute up to 15.16 PWh/km2 /yr. Xinjiang province has the highest RE potential for it contains a large share of suitable area with good resource quality. The findings illustrate the contribution of northwest China towards achieving SDGs and facilitate the formulation of more targeted resource policies.

As shown in Fig. 2  ., IEA (2023)  reports that CO2  emissions resulting from energy combustion and industrial processes reached a new peak, with a growth rate of 0.9% or 321 Mt, totaling 36.8 GtCO2 . Fossil fuels have taken an instrumental role in the advancement and shaping of human society. However, the substantial emission of greenhouse gases is also the primary catalyst for global warming (Li et al., 2018 ; Tian et al., 2023 ). Thus, emerged as an effective way, the development of eco-friendly and sustainable energy sources, including solar and wind power, contribute to the enhancement of energy security and to the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions (Jain et al., 2020 ; Jung and Schindler, 2020 ; Neupane et al., 2022 ; Luo et al., 2023 ) (see Table 1  ). In this context, it is imperative to align energy transitions with the SDG 7 strategy (2024Estevão and Lopes,). The core objective of SDG7 is to reduce the proportion of fossil fuel consumption and fulfill energy demands in an environmentally sustainable manner, with the aim of effectively mitigate environmental pollution levels and carbon emissions. China has been actively enhancing and adjusting the energy mix since the United Nations proposed the SDGs, with the primary objective of establishing a clean, low-carbon, secure and highly efficient energy system. The proposed Carbon Peaking and Carbon Neutrality Goals (CPCNGs) in 2017 also emphasizes the importance of low-carbon and sustainable development. Focused on the development of RE, by the end of 2022, the country's installed capacity exceeded 12 billion kilowatts, with wind and solar power generation contributing respectively 3.65 and 3.93 billion kilowatts. The total electricity generated by RE amounted to 2700TWh, representing 31.6% of the overall electricity consumption in society. The significance of RE in ensuring a stable energy supply is becoming increasingly evident (NDRC, 2023 ). In addition, China has successively commenced large-scale RE projects, showcasing its unwavering commitment to green development and goals of carbon neutrality (NDRC, 2021 ). An example is the almost 100 billion yuan invested in Gansu, Ningxia, and other provinces in North China, where, as for a series of national RE policies, including the 14 th Five-Year Plan for Modern Energy System,  the first batch of large-scale wind power and photovoltaic (PV) base projects with an installed capacity of approximately 100 million kilowatts has been initiated and implemented. On a national scale, the RE resources in northwest China constitute over 70% of the total resources, with wind and solar resources accounting for approximately 85% and 90%, respectively. Considering that the vast expanse of the Gobi and desert in northwest China is relatively unaffected by land use, the abundance of natural resources in this region makes it an ideal area for the development of RE and a further investment from the Chinese government (Montero et al., 2022 ; Luo et al., 2023 ). Our study aims to comprehensively assess the potential of wind and solar energy in northwest China, in line with a series of policies implemented by the Chinese government to promote the advancement of RE sources. From a regional perspective, our analysis of the energy potential provides theoretical evidence for elucidating why northwest China holds such a significant strategic position in the country's energy transition (Zhu et al., 2021 ) and its contribution towards achieving SDGs. It is a complementary approach to previous studies that focused exclusively on the national level, and is closely aligned with the specific context of China. It is worth noting that, despite the large-scale electricity generation, there are still challenges related to wind and solar curtailment and market consumption. The contradiction between the relative overcapacity of RE and underconsumption continues (Tian et al., 2023 ). Since 2020, the Chinese government has implemented the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) to address consumption issues, which legally promotes the scaling up of RE. In this context, we conducted supplementary studies to investigate whether northwest China can meet the electricity consumption demand under the RPS target, considering the existing RE potential. Furthermore, how can northwest China achieve CPCNGs by pursuing the energy transition of substituting fossil fuels with clean energy sources? The remaining framework is outlined as follows. Section 2  provides a review of the pertinent literature, and the research methodology is introduced in Section 3 . Assessment results of geographical, technical, and economic potentials are presented in Section 4 . Section 5  focuses on the contributions of northwest China. Finally, research summary and policy discussion are offered in Section 6 .  2 Literature review 2.1 The effect of low-carbon policies The signing of the Paris Agreement  and the proposal of SDGs have directly influenced the setting of RE targets in many countries. Widely acknowledged green and low-carbon concepts, along with the implementation of environmental policies, have directly contributed to the current assessment of RE potential in various countries and region. Continuous enhancement and innovation in theoretical research have led to the development of a comprehensive framework for evaluating RE source potential. For example, Yushchenko et al. (2018)  used GIS and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) to evaluate the potential of rural solar power generation in West Africa, and their findings indicate that concentrated solar power production has the technical potential for 700 to 1800 TWh/year, while for PV it ranges from 900 to 3200 TWh/year. It establishes a theoretical foundation for governments, non-governmental organizations, private investors, and other stakeholders to identify potential solar power regions in West Africa. To better accomplish the objective of the Indian Government to enhance the proportion of RE in the nation's energy mix, Jain et al. (2020)  assessed India's wind and solar energy potential using detailed land suitability analysis and quantification of spatial and temporal variability. The authors suggest that India's energy needs can be met with adequate RE at competitive costs, as evidenced by maximum energy potentials reaching 16,846 GW for solar and 3102 GW for wind respectively. The development of RE has greatly benefited from the prominent role played by onshore wind energy, which boasts lower production costs. According to Enevoldsen et al. (2019) , the existing onshore wind power generation technology in Europe is sufficient to meet the entirety of energy demand by 2050. Their study provided and updated analysis of the 2009 EEA potential results using advanced technological methods. In addition to traditional geographical analysis, Enevoldsen and Permien (2018)  also incorporated stakeholder groups' perceived risk into the development of new wind projects in Sweden. This approach reflects a more comprehensive consideration of technological and societal challenges facing wind energy generation. The socio-technical wind atlas they developed unveiled the potential of wind energy in Sweden, while also addressing the social challenges arising from the implementation of new wind projects.  2.2 Research in China 2.2.1 Geographic potential Energy potential is typically defined as the total amount of energy estimated in a given geographic area, based on the available technology. The energy potential concept can be further classified into various types, including geographical potential, technical potential, and economic potential, depending on constraints and barriers. Geographic potential refers to the total land area suitable for the installation of wind turbines and PV modules while considering various constraints. For China, areas with high elevations, steep slopes, urban built-up regions, and high-coverage forests and grasslands are unsuitable for installation and need to be excluded. The establishment of buffer zones is a prerequisite for implementing exclusions in the case of highways, waterways, ecological reserves, etc. In PV power generation, the corresponding upper and lower limits for elevation, slope and land use have been described by He and Kammen (2016)  in their production of provincial solar energy availability maps. These maps utilized 10 years of hourly solar radiation data for 200 representative regions from 2001 to 2010. However, the study oversimplified the complex factors that influence human socio-economic life, including transportation and urban development. Zhang et al. (2020)  suggested that the establishment of large-scale PV power stations is not feasible in areas where there were protected areas, surface slopes exceeding 5°, water bodies, and unsuitable land use conditions. China's offshore wind potential was assessed by Hong and Möller (2011) , who concluded that it should be regulated by implementing buffer zones for shipping, cables, oil and gas platforms, as well as marine archaeology.  2.2.2 Technical potential Technical potential is considered to be the process of electricity generation using a specific technology type, taking into account geographic constrains and feasible area. The solar energy technical potential of China was estimated to range from 0.9 MJ to 479.49 MJ by Zhang et al. (2020) . The most significant factor that affected technical potential in their study was the availability of feasible land area, which revealed a distinct scarcity of suitable land in the Eastern region for large-scale PV station operations, while the northwest had abundant land resources. According to Qiu et al. (2022) , who conducted a comprehensive assessment of land suitability and theoretical power generation, China's PV power generation potential in 2015 was estimated at 131.942PWh. The GIS + MCDM method was employed by Chen et al. (2023)  to assess the potential of solar power generation in China, revealing a capacity of 100.8PWh. The technical potential of wind energy is also being considered. The study conducted by Lu et al. (2009)  demonstrated that the estimated onshore wind energy potential in China was approximately 3,9000TWh. The technical utilization rate of onshore wind farms in China was estimated to range from 2000 to 2500TWh, according to He and Kammen (2014) . Based on the range primarily determined by assumptions regarding turbine spacing, Davidson et al. (2016)  proposed that, after excluding unsuitable areas for wind farm construction, the physical potential was 13.1–39.5 PWh/yr. It was equal to 1.3–4 times China's projected electricity demand in 2030, which stands at 9.9 PWh/yr. Feng et al. (2020)  considered the impacts of local topographic factors like surface roughness and air density. They found that China's technical potential for onshore wind energy was 2560TWh/yr under a scenario of 0% agricultural land and 3501TWh/yr with a 70% agricultural land scenario.  2.2.3 Economic potential The Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) is an economic indicator for evaluating the overall competitiveness of different power generation technologies, with the entire life cycle of an energy project. It is expressed as the ratio between the net present value of total costs over the project lifespan and the annual net electricity generation. There are minor variations in how LCOE models are constructed across organizations and research. For example, the International Energy Agency analyzes the repercussions resulting from fluctuations in financial expenses (Lantz et al., 2012 ), while the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in the United States considers the investment costs for construction and capital expenditures (Christopher et al., 2015 ). Technical potential assessments have revealed a similar diversity in economic potential of RE in China. The assessment conduct by Zhang et al. (2020)  revealed that the economic potential of solar energy in China ranged from 0.12$/MJ to 6.02$/MJ. Among all regions in China, the northwest region had the highest economic potential, whereas the eastern part of North China and East China had relatively lower potentials. The economic potential of solar power generation was projected to reach 79.7PWh by 2021, achieving cost parity with local coal power tariffs, as reported by Lu et al. (2021). Regarding wind energy, Liu et al. (2017)  found that China's onshore wind power can generate up to 8.13PWh with a 2.5 MW wind turbine. Davidson et al. (2016)  analyzed China's economic potential of wind energy and found a total available wind energy potential of 17.9PWh.  2.2.4 Research gaps By consolidating and synthesizing the existing evaluations of China's RE potential, certain characteristics can be discerned. Firstly, assessments of China's energy potential exhibit relatively large disparities in their findings, which can be attributed to various factors. According to Davidson et al. (2016) , wind energy potential assessments are influenced by various factors, such as the dataset selection, geographic constraints, anticipated tariff levels, and future cost. Tian et al. (2023)  ascribed the uncertainty in the findings to disparities in climate data and criteria for terrestrial (or oceanic) suitability, alongside divergent assumptions regarding energy technology and economic parameters. Generally, existing studies have identified a wide range of sources for meteorological data, including MERRA, GEOS-5DAS, 3TIER satellite data and ERA5 reanalysis data. These data sources are crucial in obtaining information pertaining to meteorological elements. Disparities in data quality and granularity can significantly impact energy potential, with previous studies typically employing coarser spatial resolution data (Qiu et al., 2022 ). Secondly, existing studies have primarily focused on measuring RE while neglecting a meaningful discussion on its relevance in the context of low-carbon development. In other words, most studies have concentrated on the “where” and “how much” of China's energy potential, failing to establish a comprehensive understanding of why it is crucial to assess China's RE potential in relation to the current economic and social context. Additionally, limited attention has been given to the impact of Chinese government policies on driving RE advancement and utilization, thus diminishing the distinctiveness of existing studies in relation to China. Thirdly, discussions on energy potential have predominantly focused on the national level, with comparatively less emphasis placed on the provincial and municipal levels. It can be challenging for energy assessments at the national level to capture regional characteristics for analyzing supply and demand. The spatial disparity between the supply and demand of energy resources, coupled with the increasing adoption of RPS, has necessitated an evaluation of energy resource distribution and potential at the provincial level. The focus of this paper is to examine the comparative advantages of wind and solar energy in northwest China while considering the policy drivers behind CPCNGs and SDGs. GIS + MCDM methodology is initially employed to assess regional energy potential. A supply-demand perspective is used to analyze the contribution of energy potential in northwest China to achieving low-carbon development and SDGs. We also offer relevant policy suggestions and recommendations to facilitate the formulation of a strategic long-term development plan for RE in northwest China.    3 Research design In this part, GIS + MCDM methodology was introduced for the evaluation of wind and solar energy potential. This approach combined ERA5 reanalysis data with a spatial resolution of 0.1° × 0.1° and incorporated geographically constrained layers to unveil the spatial heterogeneity. The energy potential at different levels was evaluated using the Analytic Hierarchy Process, after dividing it into 1kmx1km grid units. For geographic potential, we considered the technical suitability of RE development, aiming to exclude unsuitable areas and determine the feasible total area under external constraints. To analyze annual capacity for technical potential, we primarily calculated hourly energy production specific to each technology type. The LCOE was utilized as a metric for assessing the economic feasibility of wind and solar power generation (Davidson et al., 2016 ; Jain et al., 2020 ; Tian et al., 2023 ). The process of this research is shown in Fig. 3  . 3.1 Research area Situated deep within the Asian-European continent, northwest China is geographically distant from the sea, encompassing a latitude and longitude range of 73°E−123°E and 32°N-50°N. In terms of administrative divisions, the region comprises three provinces and two autonomous regions, namely Shaanxi Province, Gansu Province, Qinghai Province, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The corresponding provincial areas are 20,5600 km2 , 6,6400 km2 , 42,5800 km2 , 72,2300 km2 , and 166,4900 km2  in size, respectively. In total, they cover an area of 30,4000 km2  which accounts for approximately 32% of the country's entire land area. The climate in northwest China is characterized by aridity, with the terrain predominantly composed of plateaus, basins, and mountains. Ground vegetation includes grasslands, Gobi Desert, and others. The region is shown in Fig. 4   (see Table 2 ).  3.2 Data Original data were collected from the National Climatic Data Center, which obtained 10m wind speeds from 51 observation stations in five provinces in northwest China from 2000 to 2022. Solar radiation data sourced from ERA5 reanalysis information (Muñoz, 2019 ) was utilized, featuring a spatial resolution of 0.1°x0.1°and temporal coverage ranging from 1950 to present with monthly updates. Comparative analysis also incorporated ERA5 wind speed data. The data layer sources used in the geographic potential assessment is listed in Table 3   .  3.3 Methodology The GIS + MCDM method is widely used for optimal location planning worldwide. The importance of geographic information lies in the utilization of GIS (Shao et al., 2020 ). It integrates data storage, management, calculation, analysis, and other functionalities, and visually represents original geographic data in a meaningful format based on the researcher's subjective initiative (Janke, 2010 ). Meanwhile, MCDM is recognized methodology for addressing intricate decision-making problems through the evaluation and comparison of attributes that characterize alternatives, ultimately facilitating optimal choices (Villacreses et al., 2017 ). The unique and interconnected framework formed by combining both GIS and MCDM approaches can be used to effectively address complex spatial planning problems (Lantz et al., 2012 ). 3.3.1 Methodology for assessing geographic potential In this study, we incorporated various land use constraints, including topography, land cover, socio-economics, history and culture, to determine the available area for installing RE power facilities in the region. The required layers can be found in Table 3 . ArcMap 10.1 software was used for GIS analysis. All vector and raster data layers were projected onto a consistent coordinate system utilizing the Projections tool in the Data Management Toolbox. Subsequently, differentiated treatments of these layers were carried out to address the specific needs of RE potential assessments. The procedural steps undertaken are outlined as follows.(1) Based on the provincial administrative boundaries of northwest China, regional geographic information was extracted by applying a mask tool to process the DEM and land cover model of China.  (2) The extracted DEM was reprocessed to generate a slope model. Then, the elevation model, slope model, and land cover model were reclassified to exclude unsuitable areas and land types.  (3) Based on different standards, buffer zones were set for vector layers of railroads, highways, waterways, water bodies and protected areas.  (4) The unsuitable layers were merged and superimposed together. The erase tool excluded all unsuitable sites from the administrative boundary of the region. Ultimately, areas with potential generating capacity were calculated.    Individual layers underwent GIS operations to meet siting criteria for RE plants, as explained below.(1) Elevation. The installation of RE equipment, particularly wind turbines, is threatened and challenged by the harsh climatic conditions at high elevations, characterized by strong winds and low temperatures. Therefore, areas where elevation exceeded 4000m were excluded.  (2) Slope. Due to its impact on the optimal orientation and inclination of PV panels, areas with slopes exceeding 5° were excluded from the analysis of solar energy potential. Considering the challenges posed by steep slopes in construction, areas with slopes exceeding 30° were excluded for wind energy development.  (3) Land use land cover. The dataset used in this study was based on a LUCC classification system (Table 4  ) by the Chinese Academy of Sciences that included six primary land types and 25 secondary land classes, including cultivated land, grassland, forested land, water bodies, settlements, and unutilized land. Considering the energy development standards and policies in China, labels 21–22, 31–32, 41–44, 51–53 and 64 were considered unsuitable for wind power generation. Labels 11–12, 21–22, 31–32, 41–46, 51–53 and 64 were unsuitable for PV generation.  (4) Rail and road network. The exploration of RE was conducted with the exclusion of transportation factors. In anticipation of future expansion, a buffer zone of 300m were set for the existing road networks.  (5) Water bodies. The development of RE necessitated the exclusion of natural water bodies, such as rivers, streams, lakes, marine areas and glaciers, along with the establishment of a 300-m buffer zone.  (6) Protected areas. Protected areas and their surrounding 1 km radius were deemed unsuitable for wind and PV power generation, as it was necessary to preserve the natural ecosystems, rare flora and fauna, as well as natural monuments.  (7) Urban built-up areas. The siting of wind turbines and PV modules is generally avoided in densely built-up areas where people live and work. A buffer zone of 5 km was recommended to account for the expanding urbanization trends.    Based on the final results of layer processing and overlay analysis, the Zonal Statistics as Tables Tool was used to calculate the total suitable land area in northwest China and obtain detailed information about provinces. The maximum geographic limits for power generation at the provincial level provided a fundamental basis for subsequent assessments of technical potential.  3.3.2 Methodology for assessing energy technical potential This subsection focuses on the methodology used to evaluate wind and solar potential and the types of technologies that were chosen. Based on the calculated feasible area, an estimation was made for the total wind and solar power generation over a year, taking into account relevant parameters associated with selected wind turbines and PV modules.(1) Wind power analysis    The data collected represents wind speeds at a height of 10m. Wind speeds at specific hub-height (110m and 140m) were initially derived using the log-law equation. Equation (1) (2) demonstrate this process (Manwell et al., 2009 ; Jain et al., 2020 ; Tian et al., 2023 ).(1) α = [ 0.37 ‐ 0.088  ln ( v 1  )   ]  / [ 1 ‐ 0.088  ln ( z 1  10  )   ]          (2) v 2  = v 1  ( z 2  z 1   )  α          Where α    is the wind shear coefficient. z 1  and  z  2     are the observed and desired heights. v 1     and v 2     are the wind speeds at the observed and desired heights. By adjusting the 10m wind speed, the hub height wind speed was obtained. Goldwind Sci & Tech Co., Ltd., as a leading enterprise in China's wind power industry, boasts a substantial installed capacity. The parameters of Goldwind's GW155-4.5 MW were therefore chosen for wind power calculation. This turbine utilizes “PMDD + full-power converter” technology and can be tailored to suit the medium and high-speed wind conditions and environment in northwest China (with hub height options of 95m, 110m, 140m). Wind power output can be calculated as follows.(3) TP wind  = ∑ i = 1  n  P i  × S i   5 D × 9 D   × 8760         (4) S i  = 1 2  × ρ × v 3  × δ × A         Where TP wind     is wind power potential (MWh). S i     is suitable land area (km2 ). The ground area assigned to each turbine in a windfarm is determined by 5 D × 9 D    (Liu et al., 2017 ), and D    is rotor diameter (m). The standard year consists of 8760 h. ρ    represents the air density (kg/m3 ). V is the wind speed at the desired height (m/s). δ    indicates the wind turbine coefficient of performance. A    represents the swept area of the rotor (m2 ).(2) Solar PV analysis    The following equation was utilized to calculate solar power generation (Saraswat et al., 2021 ).(5) TP solar  = ∑ i = 1  n  GHI i  × S i  × AF × θ         Where TP solar     is solar power potential (MWh). GHI i     is the average annual total solar radiation (W/m2 ). S i     is suitable land area (km2 ). The area factor AF    reveals the maximum area that can be covered by solar panels with a minimal shadow effect. Prior research has found that AF is regarded as 0.7 (Saraswat et al., 2021 ). The current conversion efficiency of mass-produced cells is approximately 24%–25% due to the application of high-efficiency N-type TOPCon cell technology. Therefore, θ    was set to 0.25.  3.3.3 Methodology for assessing economic potential The LCOE parameter is an important indicator of energy project feasibility, informing government initiatives and private investments towards the advancement of RE. The LCOE in this study was calculated using the following equation.(6) LCOE = I 0  ‐ VR ( 1 + i  )  n   + ∑ t = 1  n  A n  + D n  + P n   ( 1 + i  )  n    ∑ t = 1  n  Y n  ( 1 + i  )  n             Where I 0     represents the initial investment cost (CNY/kW). VR    represents the salvage value of fixed assets (CNY). I    is the discount rate (%). A n     is the operating cost in nth year (CNY). D n     is average annual depreciation (CNY). P n     is the interest in the nth year. The lifetime of the technology is n (years). Y n     represents the yearly electricity production (KWh/yr). The relevant parameters are specifically listed in Table 5  . In addition, the learning curve describes how the unit cost of increased investment in a specific technology decrease as the accumulated installed capacity increases. It measures future change in the cost of capital for wind and solar technologies (Lantz et al., 2012 ). Equations (7) and (8)  are used to determine future alterations in unit investment costs.(7) C t  = C 0  × ( I t  I 0   )  ‐ α           (8) LR = 1 − 2 ‐ α           C t     represents the capital expenditure of energy technology in the nth year. C 0     denotes the initial capital expenditure in 2020. I t     is the cumulative capacity in the nth year. I 0     is the cumulative capacity in 2020. α    is a learning index and LR    represents the learning rate. Tian et al. (2023)  calculated the learning curves for each technology with historical installed capacity data from 2010 to 2020. The future costs of wind and solar power generation in the medium level scenario are reported in Table 6  . This study used future cost data for subsequent predictive analysis.    4 Results 4.1 The geographical potential of northwest China Results were obtained using MCDM and GIS software, and feasible land areas that are suitable for installations were identified (Table 7  ). The wind energy potential area in northwest China was 155,6125 km2 , while the solar energy potential area was 144,2692 km2 . Analyzed in terms of province and region, Xinjiang had the largest feasible area. It possessed 10,564,497 km2  and 9,810,680 km2  of wind and solar energy resources respectively. On the other hand, Ningxia had the smallest area with only 27,083 km2  of wind energy and 21,602 km2  of solar energy. The wind potential area generally exceeded that of solar, which indicated that installing PV power generation equipment could be more constrained compared to wind power generation. The results of the GIS operations conducted on the layers are presented in Fig. 5  . Fig. 5 (a) shows the results of the elevation reclassification in the northwest China. In this study, areas exceeding 4000m were considered unsuitable for RE development and were primarily located in western Xinjiang, northern and western Qinghai Province. The slope models generated and reclassified using the DEM are presented in (b) and (c). As a result of extensive plateaus, desert grasslands, and the Gobi, the topography of northwest China appears relatively flat. Slopes exceeding 5° are predominantly found in areas where mountain ranges, such as the Tianshan Mountain Range and Qilian Mountain Range, are situated. The existence of places with slopes exceeding 30° is rare. The land cover labels that were unsuitable for wind and solar power generation according to the CAS classification system are shown in (d) and (e).  4.2 The technical potential of northwest China The NCDC and ERA5 datasets were used to estimate the wind energy technical potential of northwest China. However, due to the unavailability of solar radiation data in northwest China, only the ERA5 dataset was used to estimate solar potential. The total wind energy technical potential results calculated using NCDC were 9.84PWh/km2 /yr at a height of 110m and 12.34PWh/km2 /yr at a height of 140m. Furthermore, based on ERA5 wind speed data, the wind potential at 110m was 2.86 PWh/km2 /yr, while total wind potential was 3.59 PWh/km2 /yr at 140m. The total solar technical potential was 15.16 PWh/km2 /yr. The potential for solar energy in northwest China was greater than for wind energy, as depicted in Fig. 6  . This can be attributed to the temperate arid and semi-arid climate in the region, where annual precipitation is mostly less than 500 mm, with some areas like the Hexi Corridor receiving less than 100 mm. Given that a significant portion of this region falls within China's solar resource-rich zones, it experiences over 3000 h of sunshine annually, providing a natural advantage for the development of solar energy. However, high wind speed areas are primarily concentrated in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and coastal regions. In the west-central part of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, the average annual wind speed at a height of 100m was higher than 7 m/s, with over 75 windy days per year. Nevertheless, overall average wind speeds in northwest China have not yet met the required standards, resulting in relatively limited development potential for wind power. The wind energy potential of northwest China, as shown in Fig. 7  ., was calculated based on various datasets. However, discrepancies were observed between the ERA5 reanalysis data and the NCDC site data calculations. The province and region analysis showed that Xinjiang had the highest technical potential for wind and solar energy development, whereas Ningxia had relatively lower potential (Table 8  ). This finding was consistent with the outcomes of the land suitability analysis, which indicated that the area of suitable land directly influenced the energy potential. The wind energy potential distribution, calculated using the NCDC dataset at a height of 110m, is shown in Fig. 8  (a). Regions with high wind energy potential (>20GWh/km2 /yr) were primarily located in northwest Gansu, whereas areas with medium-high potential (8-20GWh/km2 /yr) can be found in the west, north, and northeast of Gansu as well as northwest Qinghai. Conversely, low-potential areas (0-8GWh/km2 /yr) were distributed throughout the central part of Xinjiang, central Gansu, northeastern Qinghai, and Ningxia and Shaanxi. The wind energy potential distribution at a height of 140m is shown in Fig. 8 (b). Elevation plays a role in influencing wind speed; within a certain range, higher elevations generally experience stronger winds and theoretically possess greater wind potential. Notably, the distribution of potential areas at 140m closely resembled that at 110m. Fig. 8 (c) shows the distribution of solar potential in northwest China. The high solar potential area (>11GWh/km2 /yr) was predominantly concentrated in southern Xinjiang, northern Qinghai, and southwestern Gansu. The second-highest solar potential area (10-11GWh/km2 /yr) was found in the central part of Xinjiang, most parts of Gansu, and the central part of Ningxia. On the other hand, the low solar potential areas (0-10GWh/km2 /yr) were roughly distributed across northern Xinjiang, southern Gansu and Ningxia, as well as Shaanxi.  4.3 The economic potential of northwest China The LCOE methodology was used to estimate the cost of wind and solar energy generation in northwest China in 2020. The spatial distribution results are shown in Fig. 9  (a) and (b), illustrating the LCOE for each grid cell as it corresponds to a specific technology type for both solar and wind energy. The spatial distributions of the economic and technical potential in northwest China were consistent. In regions with high technical potential for wind energy, such as western and northern Gansu and northwestern Qinghai, the cost of electricity generation was typically low throughout the entire region. The cost of electricity generation in the central part of Xinjiang, where the technical potential was relatively lower, tended to be higher. Compared to the decentralized distribution of wind power generation cost, solar power generation cost in the northwest was primarily concentrated within the range of 0.3–0.4CNY/KWh, with higher cost predominantly observed in southern Shaanxi. The wind power and PV industry have to be economically viable in order to fully capitalize on their pollution-free and renewable advantages under the current market economy conditions. The implication is that RE power generation costs should be competitive when compared to conventional energy sources. When comparing the prices of desulfurized coal power across various provinces in 2020 (Table 9  ), it becomes apparent that wind and PV power generation costs demonstrate economic efficiency in the majority of northwestern regions in China. However, there are still a few regions, such as the southwestern and eastern parts of Xinjiang, where the topography results in increased costs for wind power generation. Therefore, priority should be given to regions with low power generation costs that are close to load centers, while ensuring orderly development and utilization of wind and photovoltaic energy resources within each province.   5 Contribution to SDGs and carbon neutrality Under the SDGs framework, SDG7 aims to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable modern energy (Pandey and Asif, 2022 ). This objective necessitates uninterrupted availability of clean and RE sources, which aligns seamlessly with China's pursuit of carbon neutrality. The abundant clean energy sources such as wind and solar power in China's northwest region has emerged as a viable alternative to conventional fossil fuels, playing a pivotal role in mitigating carbon emissions and air pollution. Based on the evaluation, the findings demonstrate that northwest China has abundant technical potential for RE that would enable it to meet the demand for low-carbon electricity and align with China's development objectives, making a certain contribution to the achievement of SGD7. The technical feasibility, however, does not mean there will be rational development and utilization of all RE sources. The frequent occurrence of wind and solar power wastage is a typical manifestation of uncoordinated development. This is because China's new energy consumption market mechanism is not comprehensive, which poses numerous obstacles to consumption. Due to uneven distribution patterns, northwest China has concentrated wind and solar power generation potential while economically well-developed regions such as eastern and southern China emphasize electricity demand. In the process of establishing the market system for the northwest Regional Power Grid, most existing electricity market trading mechanisms fail to facilitate competitive market transactions, resulting in limited growth in traded power and fixed trading tariffs. Therefore, drawing from international experience, the Chinese government introduced the Renewable Portfolio Standard in 2009 as a strategic measure to address the challenge of energy wastage. It is believed that the system will align with China's overall energy development strategy by facilitating high-target and high-speed growth in RE (NDRC, 2023 ). With generation costs below the 2020 desulfurized coal electricity price for each province in the region, the economic potential of northwest China was screened out using it as a benchmark. The summarized results were compared with the electricity demand calculated based on the 2030 provincial non-hydro RPS targets to assess whether northwest China can fulfill its own green electricity consumption requirements and contribution towards achieving SGDs and CPCNGs. The results obtained by multiplying the provincial non-hydro RPS targets established by the central government with the electricity demand forecasts are shown in Table 9  (He and Kammen, 2014 ; Tian et al., 2023 ). Fig. 10  (a), (b) and (c) depict the results of matching wind and solar energy potential in northwest China for 2020, 2030, and 2050 with the non-hydro RE consumption target set for 2030. We compared wind and solar energy potentials with consumption targets for non-hydro RE, because wind and solar energy account for nearly all of China's non-hydro RE generation. The utilization of distinct provincial background colors in Fig. 10  (a) and (b) served as a criterion to assess the fulfillment of RPS targets by the five northwest provinces. The maps are accompanied by a separate pie scale chart that compares the combined wind and solar potential with the cost of desulfurized coal electricity in each province. The findings indicated that, in 2020, except for the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, the remaining four provinces surpassed their respective targets and exhibited a predominant focus on onshore wind energy development. According to the projections, by 2030, all five northwest provinces will be capable of achieving their non-hydro RPS targets through independent RE development. The growth rate of PV power is expected to surpass that of wind power, positioning it as a pivotal component in the advancement of RE. Fig. 10 (c) shows the distribution of energy potential in 2050 and the comparison with demand for non-hydro RE in 2030. The share of wind and solar development in northwest China will become more stable by 2050, with PV generation surpassing wind generation in terms of power output. In terms of the ratio between energy potential and electricity demand by province, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Gansu Provinces will significantly surpass their own electricity demands. Although Ningxia and Shaanxi have slightly lower ratios compared to other provinces, they will still exceed their energy potentials by more than twice their own electricity demands. Thus, the RPS ensures that northwest China, as an “energy base”, will play an indispensable role in China's pursuit of carbon neutrality under the SDGs framework. Thanks to its abundant resources, northwest China will not only achieve self-sufficiency in terms of wind and solar generation, but also facilitate the transmission of green power to regions like south and east China, meeting their power demands that are well beyond what northwest China requires (this relies on further advancements in transmission lines and energy storage technology). This contribution supports the overall realization of a carbon-neutral power system in China.  6 Conclusion and policy implications 6.1 Conclusion The energy and environmental prospects in northwest China align well with the SDGs, considering the context of sustainable development and its advantageous energy resources. This study began with an evaluation of wind and solar energy potential in northwest China. By considering terrain, climate, economic and social factors, the feasible area for wind energy was determined to be 155,6125 km2  using the GIS + MCDM method. Additionally, the feasible area for solar energy was calculated to be 144,2692 km2 . In terms of technical potential, the annual power generation results for wind energy were 9.84PWh/km2 /yr at 110m, and 12.34PWh/km2/yr at 140m. The solar energy potential amounted to 15.16PWh/km2 yr. The spatial distributions of both technical and economic potential were consistent. Directly influenced by the feasible area, Xinjiang had a relatively greater potential for energy development among the five provinces, while Ningxia ranked last. However, the uneven distribution of wind and solar resources across China has further complicated the challenge of market consumption, thereby constraining the development and utilization of RE. The implementation of RPS by 2020 has emerged as a pivotal measure to address this issue. Based on the results of energy potential assessments and projections, northwest China demonstrates significant potential for wind and solar power generation. It will not only have the capacity to meet its own power demands but will also be able to export green power to other provinces, thereby supporting China's objective of achieving carbon neutrality. The potential for clean energy generation not only directly contributes to carbon reduction and haze control but also serves as a crucial means of achieving SGD7. In addition, the implementation of west-to-east transmission lines and advancements in energy storage technology are important measures.  6.2 Policy implications In this subsection, we offer three recommendations that would continuously promote wind and solar sources being effectively utilized. The first is that the abundant wind and solar energy reserves in the desert, the Gobi, and the arid regions of northwest China should be used to their fullest potential. This can be achieved by expediting the construction of large-scale wind power and PV bases to optimize land utilization, exploit energy resources on a massive scale, and promote intensive development. The region can respond to the demand for low-carbon transformation by exploring techniques such as PV sand control, windbreaks, grass consolidation, and ecosystem protection and restoration. The second is to facilitate the integration of RE and energy storage in northwest China. The focus lies on the layout of demonstration projects aimed at utilizing highly efficient RE and advanced energy storage. It would actively promote large-scale power generation and advanced solar thermal technology, while also perfecting the application of demand-side interactive, power virtualization, and power trading platform technologies. A novel internet plus service model would be established, augmenting the share of RE in consumption and mitigating the carbon intensity of the urban integrated energy system. The third initiative involves efforts to overcome interprovincial transmission barriers and expand northwest China's power consumption pathway. This would involve new DC transmission channel construction and enhancing the transmission proportion of clean energy power. The key strategies for enhancing the utilization of new energy power would involve: improving the medium and long-term power, spot, and power auxiliary service markets; utilizing price signals to guide new energy power consumption; and facilitating resource regulation through market-oriented means.  6.3 Future work The limitations identified in this study should be further explored in future assessments. Firstly, the capacity factor can be determined by comparing the expected energy potential (average annual hourly power over multiple years) to that at rated wind speed or STC, then conducting a province-by-province analysis with that index. Secondly, the energy potential estimates for northwest China should be re-evaluated from both temporal and spatial dynamic perspectives. Thirdly, enhanced precision in ground truth data and increased granularity are essential for augmenting RE potential assessment accuracy, as supported by the data itself. Additionally, this study only presented a moderate level of RE contribution in northwest China, so an exploration of diverse scenarios would enhance the real-world connections.
