                  Since the adoption of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, the world oceans, to which a specific goal was assigned, have been high on the global agenda. At the national level, the ocean has received increasing consideration, with many coastal states and islands adopting blue economy strategies and frameworks, and putting the ocean at the centre of development. SDG 14: Life Below Water includes ten targets, four of which (14.2, 14.4, 14.5 and 14.6) expired in 2020. This paper presents the state of progress on these four targets that address marine protection and fisheries management. The study is based on an assessment of the indicators established by the United Nations for each target, using publicly available databases allowing to measure the achievement of the targets. The analysis shows that achievement of these four targets is meagre. Only two countries achieved three of the four targets, while no country achieved all four. Most countries were classified as far from achievement or having made low progress. Across the four targets, SDG 14.5 on marine protected areas saw the highest number of achievers but also a high number of countries still far from achievement. Europe and Oceania had the highest number of countries having performed well in terms of achievement while Africa and the Middle East showed the most countries with limited achievement. These results indicate that there is still a long way to go to achieve these four targets in 2030. To move towards achievement, more investment is needed towards priority countries that have seen limited achievement but also some adaptation might be needed in terms of monitoring processes. Finally, it seems useful at this point to reflect on what has been achieved and how countries, especially those facing various socio-economic and political challenges, can fully benefit from current processes towards implementing SDG 14.

On June 1st, 2021, Ambassador Peter Thomson, the United Nations Secretary General's Special Envoy for the Ocean reflected on the progress towards achieving SDG 14 at the UN General Assembly's High-Level Thematic Debate on the Ocean. He highlighted that “Compared with the indifferent waters through which we were sailing before SDG14's arrival, Ocean Action is now flourishing around the world […]” but also that “[…] we have much work to do and should not be satisfied until the Ocean's well-being has been secured […]” (United Nations, 2021 ). These words highlight and confirm two facts. First, SDG 14 remains very high in the international agenda aligning with the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development. As research has shown, the achievement of SDG 14 is a prerequisite to the achievement of other SDGs. It has a positive correlation with the achievement of at least 10 other SDGs (SDGs 1,2,3,5,6,7,11,13,15,16) and also generates trade-offs with some of the SDGs, such as marine protection potentially leading to displacement of communities (Singh et al., 2018 ). Second, while progress is acknowledged, limitation is also recognised. Globally, it has been found that SDG 14 is one of the most difficult goals to achieve (Salvia et al., 2019 ). Despite the critical role of SDG 14, funding and research towards SDG 14 has also been limited (Johansen and Vestvik, 2020 ). These limitations are also illustrated by the paucity of literature currently available on the achievement of SDG 14 (considering that four of the goals expired in 2020). Existing research on SDG 14 often looks at individual national achievements (Gulseven, 2020 ; Rivera-Arriaga and Azuz-Adeath, 2019 ), debating the SDG itself (Armstrong, 2020 ; Cormier and Elliott, 2017 ) or highlighting the importance of the SDG in different areas of the ocean economy (Techera and Appadoo, 2020 ). Considering the current high profile of SDG 14 (UNEP, 2021 ), more research is needed to provide insights for decision-makers on how to effectively move forward in the next 10 years. To address this gap, this paper provides a global overview of current progress in terms of achieving SDG 14 and the challenges that remain. The aim of this paper is to present a global assessment of the level of achievement of the four SDG 14 targets that expired in 2020. These are: SDG 14.2,1  1 SDG 14.2: By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans.   SDG 14.4,2  2 SDG 14.4: By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics.   SDG 14.53  3 SDG 14.5: By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information.   and SDG 14.6.4  4 SDG 14.6: By 2020, prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies which contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, eliminate subsidies that contribute to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and refrain from introducing new such subsidies, recognizing that appropriate and effective special and differential treatment for developing and least developed countries should be an integral part of the World Trade Organization fisheries subsidies negotiation.   The analysis was conducted based on the UN established indicators under each target and existing databases that contain data by country regarding these targets. Existing assessments of SDG achievement either present aggregated data on each SDG5  5 https://www.unsdsn.org/sdg-index-and-monitoring .   or have limited coverage on the different goals.6  6 https://sdg-tracker.org/oceans .   This analysis complements these assessments by providing a clearer picture on SDG 14. Assessing the four SDG 14 targets presents the opportunity to reflect on using SDG 14 as a way to way advance ocean sustainability. It also allows us to think about potential improvements still needed to achieve these targets and the others that are due in 2025 and in 2030. The paper provides insights on how countries could still achieve these four targets and on potential processes needed to achieve the other SDG 14 targets due in 2030.  2 Methods 2.1 Use of existing databases The work is based on existing databases that were chosen based on two criteria. First, they had to provide data that responded closely to the established UN indicator for the 152 coastal states or the majority of them to allow comparison between countries (Table 1  ). As the list of coastal states differed slightly between databases, the list of 152 coastal states in the IUU Fishing 7  7 www.iuufishingindex.net .   (Macfadyen and Hosch, 2021 ) (used to assess SDG 14.6) was chosen. The list was also fully covered in the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) used to assess SDG 14.5. The analysis was closely aligned to what is suggested by various UN manuals on the four SDGs targets. Second, the databases chosen were established for at least three years to ensure that the data was not based on one-off assessments, that it has been used by others since and that it was updated since the adoption of the SDGs in 2015. For SDG 14.5 and 14.6, data until 2020 was available. For SDG 14.2 and 14.4, the two databases of choice held data until 2018. They were complemented by one other database respectively, providing data up to 2020. Three of the 7 databases analysed covered all the 152 coastal countries. For the other four databases, 3%–22% of countries were not covered. This was taken into consideration in the classification of achievement with two sources of data used for each SDG target apart from SDG 14.6 which covered all countries (see Tables 1–4  in supplementary material 1).  2.2 From indicators to achievement To assess the level of achievement of each of the four SDG 14 targets, a four level classification system was developed for each indicator. The four-level classification provided a view of achievement, from classification 1 ‘achieved/effective (for fisheries related goals)’ to classification 4 ‘far from achievement’ but also of progress in between, classification 2 ‘good progress’ and classification 3 ‘low progress’. Supplementary material 1  provides a more detailed explanation of the four levels of achievement as relating to each of the four targets. For 14.2 (indicator: proportion of EEZ under ecosystem-based approaches), the UNEP Global Manual (UNEP, 2021 ) suggests to assess (1) the level of implementation of frameworks like MSP and ICZM and (2) the level of ecological parameters (e.g. state of biodiversity, water quality, habitat quality, ecosystem health). To be close to these criteria, two elements were combined. First, we assessed the level of implementation of MSP in countries. We used available information in Frazão Santos et al. (2020)  which provided a global status of MSP implementation until mid 2019. For countries that were not covered by Franzão Santos et al., information was extracted from three sources: the IOC-UNESCO MSP Roadmap database providing status of MSP in countries between 2018 and 2020, an assessment of integrated coastal zone management by Barragán Muñoz (2020)  covering Latin American countries until 2020, and the Compendium of LME initiatives published in 2021 (UNESCO-IOC, 2021 ) that presents the status of LME initiatives until 2020 included. From these four sources, data was still not available for 29 countries, which was considered in the classification (Table 1  supplementary material 1). The second element of the assessment was the ecological parameters. For these, we used the 2020 Ocean Health Index (OHI) database which provided for the 152 countries the state of ocean health based on 10 components ranging from marine biodiversity to clean water and food provision (Ocean Health Index, 2021 ). Countries that achieved the target (class 1) had implemented frameworks and high OHI, countries far from achievement (class 4) were in pre-planning phase for frameworks and low OHI or no information available and low OHI. Levels in between were established from a combination of various levels of implementation of frameworks and OHI. Table 1  in Supplementary material 1 provides a detailed explanation of the four levels of achievement for SDG 14.2. For 14.4 (Indicator: Percentage of stocks within biologically sustainable levels), the FAO8  8 Metadata from https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-14-04-01.pdf .   suggests assessing stock status at both global/regional and national levels. To allow comparisons between countries, we assessed national data. Since national assessments by the FAO were based on a questionnaire which in 2021 had only been filled by 12 countries,9  9 Data extracted from http://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/indicators/1441/en/ (Accessed July 5th, 2021).   we used instead the Sea Around Us  reconstructed catch database which provides an assessment of national stocks of countries through its stock status plots [16]. To conduct the assessment, we combined the percentage of developing, exploited and rebuilding stocks (excluding over-exploited and collapsed) for the year 2018 to provide an idea of stock sustainability. To complement stock status data, we also used the Marine Trophic Index (MTI); based on the Sea Around Us  database of reconstructed catches for the period 1950–2018 (Pauly and Palomares, 2005 ). The MTI measures the changes in the annual mean trophic level of the catch of large exploited fishes in response to fishing pressure in an EEZ (Pauly and Watson, 2005 ). Countries that achieved the target (class 1) had a high proportion of sustainable fish stocks and MTI, countries far from achievement (class 4) had low proportion of sustainable fish stocks and MTI or did not have any data available on both indicators – implying to a conservative assessment in cases of data unavailability. Levels in between comprised various levels of sustainable fish stocks and MTI. Table 2  in Supplementary material 1 provides a detailed explanation of the four levels of achievement for SDG 14.4. For 14.5 (Indicator: Coverage of MPAs), the UNEP Global Manual suggests to assess the coverage of marine and coastal protected areas as well as various parameters relating to coverage of important biodiversity areas, management effectiveness, and connectivity and equity within MPAs. The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) was used to assess the MPA coverage for each country. This was complemented by the Key biodiversity areas (KBA) database to determine the extent of MPAs that covered biologically important areas. Countries that were classified as having achieved the target (class 1) had 10% or more of their EEZ covered by MPAs and more than 50% of key biodiversity areas included within these MPAs, countries far from achievement (class 4) had less than 2% of their EEZ covered by MPAs regardless of key biodiversity areas status. Levels in between comprised differing ratios of MPA coverage and KBA inclusion. Table 3  in Supplementary material 1 provides a detailed explanation of the four levels of achievement for SDG 14.5. For 14.6 (Indicator: implementation of international instruments to combat IUU fishing), the FAO suggests using the degree of implementation of international instruments to combat IUU fishing as its indicator. The underlying information is self-reported to FAO biannually by its members through an online questionnaire. The questionnaire assesses countries’ adherence to five international instruments10  10 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea; the 1995 United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement; the establishment of a National Plan of Action to Combat IUU Fishing in line with the International Plan of Action; the 2009 FAO Agreement on Port State Measures; and The FAO Voluntary Guidelines for Flag State Performance.  . At the time of writing (2021), data for 80 countries was available for 2020 and 103 countries for 2018.11  11 Data extracted from http://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/indicators/1461/en/ (Accessed July 7th, 2021).   To achieve a broader coverage of countries we used the data from the IUU Fishing (Macfadyen et al., 2021 ) which assesses exposure and response of 152 States to IUU fishing. Given that the SDG 14.6 exhorts countries to combat IUU fishing, the 17 IUU Index indicators and scores relating to state action to combat IUU fishing (i.e.  “response”) were used – going far beyond the mere ratification of instruments.12  12 See supplementary materials for more details regarding the response indicators.   Countries that achieved the target (class 1) had low IUU Index response scores (below or equal to 1.7), meaning that they adhere to most or all international instruments, that they achieve high scores across a majority of component indicators, and that they are engaged in actively combatting IUU fishing. Countries far from achievement (class 4) had high IUU index response scores (above 3.0), indicating that they have few response elements in place, and combatting of IUU fishing is generally not understood as a policy prerogative of such states. Table 4  in Supplementary material 1 provides a detailed explanation of the four levels of achievement for SDG 14.6. In addition to assessing levels of achievements of SGD 14 sub-indicators, we also did a correlation analysis between sub-indicators, and with external variables: gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, human development index (HDI) and the coastal population density. Data about GDP come from World bank database,13  13 https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD .   data about HDI come from UNDP database14  14 http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/latest-human-development-index-ranking .   and data about coastal population density come from Maul and Duedall (2021)  and UN database.15  15 https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/ (used for small coastal and island States only).     3 Results 3.1 Achievement status of ‘by 2020 goals’ As a whole, achievement of SDG 14 has been meagre, with no single country having achieved the four targets aimed for by the SDG 14 indicators (Figs. 1 and 2   ). Only two countries worldwide (Belgium and Germany) have achieved three of the targets (as indicated in Table 2  ). Less than 30% (45 countries) have achieved at least one of the targets, resulting in the significant finding that more than two thirds of coastal states globally (107 out of the 152) have not achieved a single of the four SDG targets under assessment. (See supplementary material 2  for more details on achievement of each country per indicator). The analysis for SDG 14.2 (EBA) indicates that more than half of countries (51.3%) are making low progress. Four countries (2.6%) (Belgium, Germany, Netherlands and Norway) have succeeded in meeting this target, while 17 countries (11.1%) have made no progress at all. 53 countries (34.8%) have made good progress towards this goal. Good progress according to our assessment means that countries have integrated ecosystem-based approaches for managing coastal and marine resources, including marine spatial planning, and they are achieving good ecosystem health responses. For SDG 14.4 (Fish Stocks), the achievement is notably low, with the majority of countries (61.8%) having achieved ‘low progress’. This is followed by 31.5% of countries which have made ‘good progress’. This target has only been achieved by 3 countries (the Marshal islands, Papua New Guinea and Tuvalu), all of which are in Oceania, making up less than 2% of all countries. However, this is also the target with the least data available, with data for 33 countries missing in one of the databases used for this analysis. Interestingly, this is the target that shows the lowest number of countries that are far from achievement (4.6%). SDG 14.5 (MPA) saw the most diverse result amongst the four targets. It shows a high rate of full achievement (28 countries, or 18.4%) mostly in Europe but also a high number of countries far from achievement (81 countries, or 53.3%), the majority of which are located in the African and Middle East regions. Furthermore, only 15 countries (9.8%) have made good progress towards this goal. With regards to SDG 14.6 (IUU), 24 countries have ‘achieved’  this target by mounting an overall comprehensive and effective response to IUU fishing. This target has the highest proportion of coastal States (40.1%) that are making good progress towards putting in place a comprehensive and effective response. Very few countries achieved both targets addressing similar issues, i.e.  marine protection (through SDG 14.2 and SDG 14.5) or fisheries management (through SDG 14.4 and SDG 14.6) (Table 2 ). Only three countries achieved both SDG 14.2 and SDG 14.5 linked to marine protection and no country achieved both SDG 14.4 and SDG 14.6 on fisheries. Similarly, only little correlation was found between the scores of the four SDGs analysed, the most visible correlation being between 14.2 (“EBA”) and 14.5 (“MPAs”), with a positive coefficient of 0.43. However, some degree of positive correlation was found between national income levels, human development indexes and the achievement of SDG 14.2 and SDG 14.5, the correlation underpinning the higher level of achievement of this target in developed countries. In terms of countries far from achievement, some 10% (15 countries) failed to achieve two of the targets and around 3% (5 countries) failed to achieve three of the four SDG targets analysed (Table 3  ). On fisheries related targets (SDG 14.4 and SDG 14.6), one country failed to achieve both targets. In terms of marine protection related targets, 17 countries did not achieve SDG 14.2 and SDG 14.5. No substantial correlation in lack of achievement between the different SDG 14 targets was established. The African and Middle East regions saw the highest number of countries far from achievement, mainly related to SDG 14.5. and 14.2. The North and South American regions had the lowest number of countries far from achievement.  3.2 Overall achievement in regions When comparing the number of countries in each region, there exists a large disparity between those countries which have been able to achieve at least one target, and those which have failed to do so, particularly when contrasting the values between targets related to marine conservation and those related to fisheries. Fig. 3   outlines the percentage of countries per region which have either achieved or made no progress at all towards the targets in question. Across the 8 regions analysed, the European and Oceania regions showed the most achievement with countries in the highest classification for three of the targets. Three other regions, Africa, the Caribbean and Central America and South America had achievers across two of the targets. The overall full achievement in regions vary from as low as 5%–51% of countries whereas countries far from achievement ranged from 3% to 66% of countries in regions. SDG 14.5 saw the highest number of achievers but also the highest number countries far from achievement in 7 of the 8 regions. In contrast, SDG 14.4 had the least number of achievers (one region) and countries far from achievement (three regions). The European region showed achievement for SDG targets 14.2, 14.5 and 14.6 with more than 51% of its countries achieving SDG 14.5. In contrast, it also hosted countries far from achievement in each of the four targets even if these were not more than 15% of the countries. The Oceania region showed consistent performance across three targets (SDGs 14.4, 14.5 and 14.6) with 20% of countries in the region showing achievement for each of them. It is also the only region that showed full achievement for SDG 14.4 and the only region without countries far from achievement in two of the targets. The Caribbean and Central American as well as the African and South American regions had achievers in SDG targets 14.5 and 14.6. The Caribbean region hosted countries far from achievement in all of the four targets (from 4% to 52% of countries) whereas the African region had countries far from achievement in three targets, SDG 14.2, 14.5 and 14.6 (from 12% to 27% of countries), and the South American region in two targets, SDG 14.5 and 14.6 (20% and 40% of countries respectively). The North American region consisting of two countries had one achiever across the four targets in SDG 14.5 and none of its countries far from achievement. Similarly, the Asian region saw some countries score full achievement for only one target, SDG 14.6. However, the same region hosted 5%–65% of countries far from achievement in three of the targets, SDG 14.2, 14.5 and 14.6. The Middle East region saw the most limited achievement across all four targets analysed. Full achievement was only seen in target SDG 14.5 (less than 7% of countries) and with a range of 13%–80% of countries in the region being far from achievement in all four targets. In looking at regional performance, it is noted that while percentage values have been used to indicate the relative achievement of regions, some regions are made up of as little as two countries (North America) whereas others have over thirty (Africa, Europe). Thus, the percentage figures within each region may sway significantly as a function of this.   4 Discussion 4.1 Explaining progress and delays towards SDG 14 targets Based on the foregoing analysis, it arises that the achievement of the four assessed 2020 targets of SDG 14 has been underwhelming. This result embodies both a reality-check and a wake-up call showing that not enough has been done, and that the global achievement of the 2020 SDG 14 targets is a round and inclusive failure. Over the past 5 years, the rate of political declarations and commitments seems to have outweighed actual progress towards achieving the goals established in 2015 – by a wide margin. Actual achievement is strongly skewed towards developed countries. Island states of the Oceania region have also shown a good level of achievement across four targets. The lack of achievement in most developing states is particularly striking but may also show that challenges remain in terms of means and investments in these countries. It could also be linked to a recognised lack of reporting or limited data in these countries (Failler et al., 2020 ; Stephenson et al., 2017 ). The WDPA, for example, is relying on the countries to transmit their data relating to the coverage of MPAs (SGD 14.5). However, low-income countries often have limited technical, human and financial capacities to digitize the spatial data relating to this target (Failler et al., 2019b , 2020 ; Stephenson et al., 2017 ). The lack of achievement was not surprising considering the ambition of the 4 targets and especially that two indicators (14.2 and 14.4) were entirely new compared to the other two (14.5 and 14.6) that were monitored relatively well through other existing targets or indexes. What came as a surprise however is the case of SDG 14.5 (MPA coverage) which found many countries still far off from achieving the goal. The goal is not new and builds on the CBD Aichi target 11 set in 2011 which also aimed at achieving 10% of MPA coverage by 2020. Even so, the achievement of SDG 14.5 could also be questioned as achievement can also be linked to the gazetting of large marine areas that harbour few coastal communities (the case of countries like France, the UK or New Zealand gazetting overseas and outermost uninhabited territories) and can greatly increase the global achievement of MPA coverage. These areas currently make up 17.8% of all EEZs, and 7.68% of all marine areas. Furthermore, implementing such a quantitative target is not without controversy. These objectives can distract attention, among other things, from the real “outcomes” expected of these MPAs, for instance, to guarantee general functionality of natural environments (Visconti et al., 2019 ), while low-income countries lack capacity to create and maintain large offshore MPAs. SDG 14.6 on combatting IUU fishing is the target that has seen the most progress of the four assessed, more than half of countries having achieved or made good progress. By developing national plans of action to combat IUU fishing, and signing up to response-related instruments, such as the FAO Compliance Agreement or the Agreement on Port State Measures, nations are gradually improving their ability to establish better systems to combat IUU fishing. Although it is impossible to ever fully eliminate all fishing-related offences and crime, these can be minimized by assuring that sound mechanisms are in place. However, signing up to binding instruments serves little purpose when effective implementation and enforcement do not follow. Developing countries in particular experience greater difficulties in vigorously tackling IUU fishing, which is directly associated with their limited resources to build the mechanisms to combat and eliminate IUU fishing. Finally, it has been shown (Hosch et al., 2019 ) that the corrosive effect of corruption – which is by no means limited to developing countries – hampers the establishment and effective implementation of mechanisms to curb IUU fishing. This implies that in a number of countries, change must occur in other domains – relating to the quality of governance for instance – for solid progress to be made in terms of combatting IUU fishing. Achievement of SDG 14.2 and SDG 14.4 appears to be the most challenging as reflected by the very low number of countries that have achieved the targets and high number of countries in no/low progress. This shows that much more efforts will be needed to address both marine conservation and fisheries management issues including meeting basic and essential needs of data availability. With regards to SDG 14.6, the issue of harmful subsidies in particular remains problematic since despite strong evidence of their negative impacts (Schuhbauer et al., 2020 ; Skerritt and Sumaila, 2021 ) and ongoing advocacy for their removal (International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development, 2016 ; Sumaila et al., 2021 ), global agreement was only reached in June 2022 and yet to be implemented (WTO, 2022 ).  4.2 The challenges of monitoring SDG 14 achievement While analysing the databases available, it was challenging to interpret what exactly was expected from the four SDG 14 targets. The indicators were either too broad, unclear or largely unrelated to the goal, which can create difficulty to assess progress from a country perspective. For SDG 14.2, the indicator for this goal [proportion of national exclusive economic zones managed using ecosystem-based approaches] was difficult to assess. The challenge is strongly evidenced by the fact that the manual for its assessment was published only in early 2020. The 2020 manual suggests that the adoption of EBA tools such as MSP or ICZM should be used. Adoption however does not necessarily mean effective implementation nor always provide a proportion of the EEZ covered. Our assessment has shown that very few countries have tools in place that are fully implemented. Another issue was that missing countries did not necessarily mean that there were no related activities undertaken. It meant that no activities were recorded within the existing platforms used for this study. This could be as a result of varying factors including limited reporting or lack of information regarding some coastal countries. For instance, MSP implementation in The Bahamas is not recorded despite efforts since 2015 to develop it through its marine protected areas and Risk and Disaster Plans, especially following the Hurricane Dorian event in September 2019 (Failler, 2020 ). In Bangladesh, ICZM has been in place since 2009 while a MSP has been drafted in 2019 alongside the Delta Plan 2100 that takes into account the climate change effects on the Ganges Brahmaputra Delta (Failler et al., 2019a ). Similarly, progress at the local level through community-based management for example are often not accounted by national and global assessments (Gurney et al., 2021 ). For SDG 14.4, the assessment is one of the most difficult as it stands, considering the limitation of national data on stock assessments. Since the adoption of the goal, the FAO has been promoting stock assessment tools and trained officials in various countries.16  16 https://elearning.fao.org/course/view.php?id=502 .   The uptake of this initiative at the national level is yet to be seen. The indicator for this goal also appears to be insufficient compared to the target it wants to achieve (regulate fishing activities). First, the sustainability level of stocks can indeed provide an idea of how well fishing activities are regulated within one country, but it does not necessarily factor in other aspects that enter into play such as ecological changes or positive change in policy and tools in place (Costello et al., 2016 ; Vaidyanathan, 2017 ). Second, data analysed from existing stock assessments has shown that recovery of stocks still remains uncertain within the current trajectory of global fisheries (Britten et al., 2021 ).This goal therefore might need to be complemented by an assessment of effectiveness of fisheries governance for example through the Global Fishing index (released in November 2021), although critics have also been raised regarding that assessment (Hilborn, 2021 ). SDG 14.5 provided a clear indicator [10% coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas] and data was available on the criteria used to assess the goal. The WDPA platform is currently used as the main platform to track this SDG. However, the WDPA have limited accounting of other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) like locally managed marine areas and territories and increasingly popular areas conserved by indigenous peoples and local communities also used as an alternative to gazetted MPAs (Newell et al., 2019 ; Rocliffe et al., 2014 ). While the addition of these areas is debated, as they may not provide the same conservation guarantees as MPAs, they are recognised as essential to achieve global goals including SDG 14 (Gurney et al., 2021 ; Reimer et al., 2021 ). In addition, the target based on the amount of protected surface area doesn't inform on the effectiveness of management processes in place in the protected areas nor prevent the creation of “paper parks”. This goal was different to the Aichi target on MPAs which had more comprehensive sub-goals including effective and equitable management, connection, and integration to wider seascapes (https://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/ ). For SDG 14.6, the official indicator used [progress by countries in the degree of implementation of international instruments aiming to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing] is not useful in gauging the degree of achievement of the stated goal [prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies which contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, eliminate subsidies that contribute to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing] – with the indicator and the goal being largely unhinged from one another. Subsidies are not normally understood to drive IUU fishing, but to drive overcapacity. The adoption of instruments to combat IUU fishing does therefore not necessarily mean achievement of this goal, implying the elimination of certain harmful subsidies. While using index values for response to IUU fishing will always remain an approximation, in practice, gauging the breadth and quality of the response levelled against IUU fishing is highly relevant and applicable to real-world examples. Previous studies have shown that the quality of governance directly impacts levels of IUU fishing (Agnew et al., 2009 ; Hosch and Macfadyen, 2022 ). Yet, addressing fisheries subsidies through the implementation of instruments against IUU would only lead to limited results in the absence of a focus on law enforcement aspects (Lee, 2019 ). To provide a picture of achievement, it was necessary to establish what was considered as level of achievement for three of the four targets assessed. The maps would therefore look differently if different levels of achievement had been established otherwise. However, the overall picture of “full achievement” would remain identical, in that all countries have failed to achieve all of the four targets, and that many countries have failed to achieve any of the targets at all. The analysis points to the need of existing indicators and goals to be reviewed or adapted according to national or regional situations, so that various forms of progress from the local to the national level may be accounted for, and so that indicators are more robust and clearer - as suggested in other similar processes such as the setting of biodiversity goals (Maron et al., 2021 ).   5 Pathways towards improved achievement Our analysis has shown that moving towards the achievement of SDG 14 will require more substantive efforts in both implementation and monitoring. Assessing the four targets of 2020 provided three insights on how goals could be better achieved. The first one is that reflecting on past achievement can inform on ways to achieve goals, as the world moves towards the endpoint of UN Agenda 2030. To achieve existing goals, indicators might need to be adapted according to available data or the monitoring capacity of countries. Measuring achievement could also focus more on quality than quantity. While the usefulness of having numerical targets is not questioned, considering the limited data available and generated, especially in low achieving counties, adopting a contextualised method that would adopt a more narrative approach to achievement in such contexts could prove useful. Such approaches, addressing holistically ecological, social and economic aspects already monitored in-country have been promoted in the Western Indian Ocean (Obura, 2020 ). Moreover, monitoring of achievement should also ensure that different types of progress from the local to the regional level are taken into consideration beyond the established indicators, to allow positive learning and exchanges beyond reporting. At the local level for example, initiatives such as locally-managed marine areas, gear restriction areas or fisheries closures can all contribute to the achievement of at least SDG 14.2, 14.4 and 14.5 (Reimer et al., 2021 ). At the national level, Novaglio et al. (2022)  highlighted that the development agenda of countries under the blue economy needs to be both sustainable and equitable within the offshore area in order to achieve SDG 14 and other SDGs. At the regional level, Haas et al. (2021)  have shown that around 50% of measures adopted by general regional fisheries management organisation contribute not only to fisheries related targets (14.4 and 14.6) but also targets linked to marine ecosystems (14.2 and 14.5). Okafor-Yarwood (2019)  has shown that better management of fishing access agreements in coastal countries can help achieve the SDG on IUU (14.6) but also marine conservation related goals. Countries and regional entities can mobilise these examples of initiatives and policy changes to better account their progress towards SDG 14. The second lesson is that the substantial disparity in achievement highlights capacity gaps between countries. Countries differ in capacity to both implementing actions towards SDG 14 and in monitoring achievement. As the flow of funding continues to increase towards SDG 14 (evidenced by various funding streams such as the blue natural capital or the blue action fund), an important part of this funding needs to be directed at improving national capacity at different levels from governments to national NGOs and research entities that are usually underfunded, understaffed, with limited resources to implement change and even less means and resources to undertake monitoring tasks. International support and funding could be directed to priority countries that are far from achievement. More investment should be made into processes that can help countries towards not only rushed achievement but especially positive change in the long term. For the four targets analysed, two parallel processes could be envisaged: establish missing processes for countries far from achievement and support existing processes for low achievers. These could include investment in data production and related training regarding stock status, as already led by the FAO. While tools such as stock assessment tools are key, they also require given levels of human capacity that are not uniformly distributed at the global level. Therefore, increasing investment in training for the data poor and low achievers would help advance SDG 14 achievements. As the decade for Ocean Science has been launched this year and the need for assessment of progress becomes pressing, a third lesson points to the importance of ocean equity within agenda 2030 as already pointed out by others (see for example Bennett (2022)  and Österblom et al. (2020) ). Beyond capacity development for priority countries, achieving SDG 14 also requires addressing structural imbalances that exist between countries such as the ability of some countries to transfer destructive activities such as overfishing or pollution to the waters of other countries through trade, fishing access agreements or other economic and geopolitical ties. This requires global collaboration to holistically implement SDG 14 and high level commitment of countries to implement SDG 14 beyond national waters. Secondly, as global initiatives continue to gain momentum, actors that are most affected by the management of the ocean and marine resources need to be at the centre of processes. They include national decision makers and local actors. Implementing actions towards SDG 14 should involve not only participation of local stakeholders, but also the elicitation of their views, ensuring that national and local views are actually taken into consideration, and may actively drive processes. Striving for the achievement of SDG 14 in the future should embody an opportunity for stakeholders to discuss, debate, agree and disagree on how to advance in an equitable, inclusive and effective manner (Bennett, 2018 ). Similarly, monitoring achievement should be done in an inclusive manner where countries feel that they are actively taking part in a process, and that they are not merely voiceless data or information providers. As various independent assessments are undertaken on different goals, these assessments should directly support the improvement of processes towards SDG 14 achievement.
