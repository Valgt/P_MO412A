                  The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have directed attention towards sustainable development and contributes to coordinating firm activity in this realm. Responsible research and innovation (RRI) is necessary to achieve goals such as eliminating poverty, eradicating hunger, and reducing inequality, as well as for reducing the environmental impact. This study analyzes the extent to which these goals are being implemented by large, innovative firms featured in Fortune's Change the World list. A content analysis of the corporate reports made available by 40 firms was conducted to act as the basis of an analysis of the sustainable measures currently being undertaken. We have conceptualized firm engagement as a constraint map for RRI where frugal and other constraint-based innovation may be suitable for firms acting in areas with low engagement. Conversely, when many firms address the same goal, large firms may better leverage their efforts if acting in innovation ecosystems. The findings indicate that companies are prioritizing the reduction of greenhouse gases, implementation of data security, promotion of diversity at the workplace, and the health and safety of employees. Overall, there is a tendency towards corporate measures that not only contribute towards the SDGs but also create clear financial value and target regulatory compliance. Sustainability reporting must thus be developed to avoid the SDGs becoming a tool for green washing and similar behaviors.

Such challenges to sustainability have led to many initiatives all over the world with many different sustainability types (Degler et al., 2021 ). To this extent, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted in 2015 by the United Nations (UN) with a strong economic, social, and environmental focus to strengthen the three dimensions of sustainable development and protect the planetary and human future. However, the 2021 progress report concludes that advancements towards the goals is too slow and additionally has suffered a severe setback due to the Covid-19 pandemic leading to the first rise in extreme poverty in a generation (United Nations, 2021 ). These goals can only be achieved with a joint endeavor using innovative approaches and including all stakeholders of the society. To accelerate on the path to goal achivement, comprehending stakeholder engagement in this matter is therefore necessary. This article aims to contribute specifically to the understanding of firm engagement in the SDGs. For this, the concept of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) is ideal: an integrative approach to involve stakeholders from all different areas along the whole research and innovation process (Von Schomberg, 2011 ). RRI is an inclusive and risk-mitigating approach to innovation contextualized within broader techno-socio-economic transformations (Wiarda et al., 2021 ). Organizations can be responsible in terms of anticipating implications of the innovation, auditing these implications, including stakeholders, and be responsive to concerns raised (Owen, 2014 ). The specificity of the SDGs provides concrete areas for firms to consider when anticipating implications during the innovation process as well as when considering the stakeholders influenced by these implications. In addition, the 169 targets associated with the SDGs give specific guidance with reference to auditing the firm's RRI activities. The RRI of firms typically matures from unawareness through reactiveness towards proactive and strategic approaches (Stahl et al., 2017 ). Concrete targets are key to initiating this maturity process and can give firms the tools necessary to advancing towards reacting to gaps in target achievement, which sets the stage for later RRI activities with a more strategic outlook. The SDGs have contributed to creating a consensus regarding terms such as sustainability and responsibility, particularly with regards to RRI (Stahl et al., 2019 ). Targets regarding innovation are centered in SDG 9 Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure, but are also associated with other goals. For example, innovation in agricultural technologies help reducing poverty, hunger, and inequality, as well as environmental impact (Nylund et al., 2021 ). Thus, the clarity of SDGs is helpful to break down, measure, and improve RRI (Yaghmaei and Poel, 2021 ). Vice versa, the concepts of RRI help us conceptualize the requirements of firms in order to achieve the SDGs and address the related grand challenges (Stahl et al., 2019 ). While the 17 UN SDGs are intended to ensure global sustainable development, achievement is often evaluated on a regional or national level for specific SDGs e.g., sustainability sciences in Indian Universities (Priyadarshini and Abhilash, 2020 ), the potential of health literacy in Nepal (Budhathoki et al., 2017 ), and the implementation of the UN goals in Russia (Mukhlynina and Vedysheva, 2020 ). There is however no evaluation of the efforts towards the SDGs across the different goals and targets, nor across firms. We therefore aim to address this gap in literature. Once we identify the extent of firm SDG involvement, we can apply RRI to explain the specific maturity level of this involvement. The measurement of progress towards the SDGs is still lacking and the operationalization of progress indicators are in need of further study (Bouma et al., 2019 ; Lozano et al., 2018 ). Increasingly, companies are not only mentioning SDG-related activities in their annual reports, but are also preparing reports specifically for this purpose, such as corporate sustainability reports. The analysis of sustainability reports is a recognized method for the evaluation of sustainability measures of a company (Aras and Crowther, 2009 , p. 279). The external evaluation of SDG implementation depends on the level of disclosure of the studied firms. This disclosure has improved over time, making the reports more reliable as a data source for the analysis of firm engagement in the SDGs. Three significant stages in the development of disclosure of corporate sustainability information can be identified: In the beginning, mainly social measures were taken and published, as there was tremendous pressure from many groups of the population pushing for fair and safe working conditions. The next stage of sustainability reporting was more focused on the environment, with the publication of the Brundtland report about preserving the planet for future generations. The third and final revolution was originated in the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development, where the Triple-Bottom-Line Approach was adopted focusing on economy, ecology, and society (Tsalis et al., 2020 ). Such increased sustainability reporting should improve the results of content analyses of sustainability reports. Considering the gap in our understanding of firm engagement in the UN SDGs, this study aims to consider to what extent and in what way the SDGs are currently being addressed by corporations. To date, there is no comparable research investigating company reports on the sustainable practices used to achieve SDGs. Former work has concentrated on examining sustainability reports concerning the general understanding of companies of sustainability and analyzing sustainable practices (Amini et al., 2018 ). However, it neglects the analysis of sustainability reports in connection with the implementation of sustainable measures for the achievement of SDGs. This paper, therefore, examines digitally published sustainability corporate reports with regard to the sustainable measures of companies and assigns them to the SDGs. The result is a holistic overview of what sustainable measures companies are taking to achieve the SDGs and the identification of specific patterns regarding the prevalence of measures across sectors. Based on the theoretical background offered in this section, the following section explains the applied content analysis methodology in further detail. Then, the results of the individual goals are presented as well as cross-goal evaluations. Finally, the results are discussed, and implications are identified for research and practice.  2 Method 2.1 Sample and data The data collected for this paper was obtained from corporations listed on the Fortune's Change the World 2019 list, which identifies the most sustainable companies of the year. Rankings of the largest and most influential companies are published annually. Fortune's credibility has been long-established. The outlet is a business magazine that is renowned for its annual rankings, such as Fortune 500 or Global 500. Each year the magazine publishes a list of companies that have positively impacted the world in the past year. Most of these companies have annual sales of over one billion dollars, which helps them do good and make the world a better place (Fortune, 2019 ). The selection of companies for the Change the World list is based on their social impact, corporate integration, degree of innovation, and business results (Shared Value Initiative, 2020 ). To investigate the companies in the sample in terms of SDGs implementation, the published corporate sustainability reports are used. The corporate sustainability reports are usually disclosed annually on the company website, where they are freely accessible to all stakeholders. If companies did not provide separate sustainability reports, the sustainable part of the company's annual reports was reviewed. As the top 50 list includes globally represented companies, different countries, sectors, and sizes of companies are considered. A total of 50 companies' websites were searched for corporate reports, resulting in 40 useable documents. Keeping in mind inclusion criteria of public access and English language, 80% of the most sustainable companies thus publicly shared details of the environmental and social responsibility of their business activities (Appendix A ). To analyze the measures taken by the companies, corporate sustainability reports were used, which were disclosed by 85% of the firms that shared sustainability information. Sustainability reports offers a recognized and reliable data source to analyze company's engagement in the SDGs. These reports follow the Triple-Bottom-Line Approach and focus on impact on economy, ecology, and society (Tsalis et al., 2020 ). However, unlike public companies, private companies are not obliged to publish corporate information. They disclose some information on their SDG related efforts as part of their annual reports therefore, where sustainability reports were not published, we used annual reports. In addition, the examination of the information reveals that the data on the company websites are not always regularly updated. In this context, the evaluation concluded that 78% of the firms uploaded current facts and figures from the years 2019 and 2020. The remaining reports are from 2017 to 2018, but not older. 90% of the investigated enterprises are public, and only 10% are privately owned. Still, as with all regulations and laws, the specific wording and definition are country-specific (Borden and Yunis, 2021 ). The headquarters of the sample companies span across 17 countries as reported in Table 1  , with the majority (56%) being in the United States. France, the United Kingdom, and China have a total share of 18%, which is the highest behind the USA with 6% each. The remaining countries (Switzerland, Netherlands, Mexico, Denmark, Belgium, Sweden, Ireland, South Africa, India, Canada, Brazil, Indonesia, and Australia) account for 26%, but over half of these minority countries are Western-European. The industry profiles are reported in Table 2  . Industries where all firms in the sample reported sustainability information are Technology, Retailing, Business Service, Chemicals, and Food & Beverages. Hence, assuring representativeness of the sample.  2.2 Content analysis The methodology of content analysis is used for text analysis, where the core statements or features of a text are examined to evaluate the information (Landrum and Ohsowski, 2018 , p. 132). This method is frequently used to assess corporate reports e.g., Bowman (1984)  analyzes the annual reports of companies with regard to their corporate strategy and the elements of risk and return. Other examples include Amini et al. (2018)  who examine sustainability reports of companies from different industries and Jang and Ardichvili (2020)  who investigate responsibility reports to understand the role of human resources. In content analysis, the texts at hand are analyzed by following a fixed procedure. The procedure should first divide texts into thematic blocks and then repeatedly revise the assignments by inductive categorization to be as specific as possible (Mayring, 2021 ). The focus themes were identified from the content of the reports and were subsequently assigned to one of the 17SDGs. This was done in a three-step procedure of content analysis proposed by Mayring (2021) : Reduction, Explication, and Structuring. The aim was to reduce and understand the content to such a level of abstraction that, in the end, the themes and the corresponding measure could be aligned to specific SDGs. The identified themes were iteratively compared and standardized using spread sheets following an inductive procedure. Finally, all the themes were assigned to a specific SDG. The coding structure was thus not imposed, but rather induced by the analyzed content. While this content contemplates the target and indicators related to each SDG, the coding arises from the prevalence of common themes within the content. The frequency measures were then counted for each theme across firms. In addition, the frequency of these themes was used to derive a ranking of the most important goals for the companies.   3 Results 3.1 Content analysis per SDG In order to screen the various sustainable measures employed by companies to achieve the SDGs, the published company reports were analyzed in detail. It is worth noting that 65% of the companies directly mentioned and addressed the SDGs in their publications. The measures were categorized inductively as described in the methodology section and Table 3   indicates the share of firms in the sample that implemented each category. Table 3  offers an overview of comparable measures companies are implementing to attain specific goals. The first SDG – to globally end poverty in all its forms everywhere -is on a reactive RRI level, one of the least addressed goals, for which only few measures have been taken. The most common way that the firms in the sample engage in fighting poverty is through paid leave for employees. This essentially denotes that the employer compensates their employees with an allowance that goes beyond hourly wages. The next most frequently occurring measures were the provision of lifesaving financial assistance and the payment of a livable wage. A livable wage should be high enough to cover necessities e.g., food, drink, and rent. The strongest represented sectors addressing SDG 1 are business services, financials, hotels, and apparel. Ending world hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture are targets within SDG 2. The few firms that prioritized food safety mainly focused on reducing risk in the value chain and operations and education in this area. Eight out of eleven sectors are working towards this goal, involving all firms in the catering sector, but only half of the food and beverage industry. Except for the food and beverage industry, this goal is more at the unawareness level in the RRI scale for other industries. In SDG 3, to ensure good health and well-being in the work environment, companies are working on minimizing the injury rate of their employees through means such as ensuring all factory employees complete mandatory safety training. Companies are approaching this more on a proactive level. The use of health technologies reduces rates of maternal death and injury, which in turn indirectly reduces the number of neonatal deaths, supports the independence of the elderly, etc. Another way of promoting a healthy lifestyle is through off-site health programs such as, for instance, discounted gym memberships, health courses, and workshops available to employees. The health care industry and the financial sector are among the most strongly represented in this SDG. SDG 4 is to ensure an inclusive, equitable, and high-quality education. In this case, only a third of the firms that contribute to this goal has provided access to further education for both employees and other people in emerging countries. One of the main activities of the companies studied is to provide equal access to quality school education, which also involves preparing youth from underserved communities for their careers. All companies from the financial sector are represented in this goal because financial resources and credits play a key role in this area. SDG 5 is dominated by the relatively convenient measures regarding gender diverse and inclusive workplace and workforce. Fewer firms engaged in the empowerment of women including female empowerment in emerging markets, enabling access to the mobile internet, providing access to a good education for girls and women, and fostering women's careers in leadership and management. Proactive approach to this goal is shown by companies in retailing, hotels, restaurants, and leisure and apparel sectors. The analysis of SDG 6 showed firm engagement in water stewardship, which ensures efficient water consumption and enables high water quality. Regarding the provision of modern water and sanitation technologies, programs include methods that enable natural resources such as rainwater to be harnessed through special systems or technologies that monitor urban water quality and provide water administrators with instant access to accurate, real-time data. Industries that work with household and personal products or hotels, restaurants, and leisure are increasingly represented in implementing the sixth SDG but more on reactive level. Ensuring affordable and renewable energy of SDG 7 is pursued through a variety of initiatives with some companies providing technologies for affordable tickets and a reliable, sustainable, and modern energy. A few firms try to counteract the energy-related issues with energy management, which means to improve energy efficiency and to increase the use of renewable energy. Further, a share of the companies is fostering sustainable power sources, such as wind power through wind farms. The healthcare and industrial sectors are the least involved and least committed to this goal hence more on the unaware level on the RRI model. The promotion economic growth and decent work of SDG 8 mainly consists of committing to human rights and labor rights in the workplace, especially the prohibition of forced labor, bonded labor, child labor, slave labor, human trafficking, and recruitment fees. This work is carried out across the value chain, including improvements regarding wages, working hours, health and safety, freedom of association, non-discrimination, and harassment prevention. To support and develop talent, the firms in the sample continuous evaluation of outsourced talent options to optimize efficiency, use technology to identify talent, fund training, retraining, and ongoing talent development. The firms support small businesses and entrepreneurs by financial assistance, sourcing from small businesses, and conveying knowledge about the market and production. This is one of the goals strategically pursued by companies. The crucial SDG 9, fomenting integrative and sustainable industrialization, supporting innovation, and strengthening infrastructure is dominated by green transportation and other innovations in green technology. This means taking full advantage of the possibilities of the existing technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, or the Internet of Things (IoT) to create innovations and technologies which operate environmentally friendly. Research and development in and around cities also generated high firm engagement, which highlights the importance of the continuous acquisition of new knowledge and using this knowledge to create new and innovative processes and products to make cities more sustainable. Proactive approach is strongly represented by technology sector, reflecting the relevance of technological innovation. The reduction of inequalities of SDG 10 is mainly implemented by our sample firms through the creation equal employment opportunities, including opportunities for lower-skilled workers. Some enterprises are fighting for equal business opportunities, especially for women-owned and diverse businesses. The financial or household and personal product industries are fully represented in this target, as opposed to the health industry is assuming a reactive approach, where only 40% of companies are engaged. The promotion of sustainable cities and communities of SDG 11 is supported through employee volunteering, which strengthens the communities and includes supporting education programs, helping to promote gender equality and life necessities such as fighting hunger. Many sample companies are promoting volunteering not only in the free time of the associates but also offering paid time off for those who volunteer. For disaster relief, companies offer instant aid. They also tackle this goal by helping develop early warning systems for disaster risk areas with technologies such as mobile applications. In all sectors studied, at least half of the companies in the sector is proactively trying to contribute to this goal. To strengthen the sustainable production and consumption patterns of SDG 12, the studied firms target carbon emissions in production. Sourcing of green and renewable energy for production and the whole facilities is obtained by wind, solar, hydropower, biomass, or landfill gas. Energy and water is conserved throughout production through low consumption, but also through the use of treated water. This goal was pursued strategically by all firms with the exception of a few representatives of the health sector. In order to mitigate climate change in SDG 13, the sample firms worked at reducing the number of greenhouse gases produced e.g., in relation to food or people. Reducing waste in landfills is done by measures such as avoiding soap and plastic bottles and reusing and upcycling waste when possible. Sustainable product design that enables customers, among others, to reduce their carbon emissions. All sectors have participated proactively in realizing measures to achieve SDG 13, but the most committed sectors include financials, apparel, and gastronomy. SDG 14 to preserve and sustainably use oceans, seas, and marine resources was implemented by the sample firms partly through the provision and development of technologies for the health of the ocean. For example, they contributed to early warning systems concerning water quality or a critical rise in the water level. Overall, it can be observed that the financial and healthcare sectors have been the least committed to this goal with a reactive approach. SDG 15, which aims to protect terrestrial ecosystems, combat desertification, and establish sustainable forest management has received particularly high engagement by the retail sector. All the other sectors show a reactive approach towards this goal. SDG 16, achieving peace, justice, and strong institution is supported by the companies guaranteeing data security for customers and partners primarily through the IoT and AI. Furthermore, the firms work to ensure that rights of everyone are respected, no unauthorized disclosures are taken, and that children's privacy is protected. Further, all sectors represented were highly committed to contribute to this goal. The last goal of the 17 UN SDGs, which requires partnerships to achieve the goals, was implemented strategically by all the companies. A more precise evaluation of the associations and collaborations was not possible due to the different levels of detail in which they were described. In some of the company reports, it was only mentioned in one sentence that partnerships exist and are promoted to achieve the goals, and in others, the contribution to the plan was described in more detail. Some of the most frequently cited partnerships are with suppliers, non-governmental organizations, third-party business partner, educational institutions, communities, public authorities, and governments. On the other hand, associations serve to pass on existing know-how and provide financial support and further advance the achievement of the goals in 2030.   4 Discussion In order to better understand the principal sources of engagement of large firms in the SDGs, we conducted a cross-goal assessment of all measures. We also mapped the frequency of these measures to the RRI maturity level as reported in Table 4  . The most popular measures relate to reducing greenhouse gas emissions of production facilities as well as in procurement and consumption. This is partly achieved by sourcing green and renewable energy, and by conserving both energy and water. Diversity and inclusiveness in the workplace is also popular. Safety is another prioritized area, both regarding data privacy and cybersecurity and regarding a safety-focused work environment ensured by regular safety training, good education, and actions to decrease injury rates. The three areas with highest firm engagement are thus areas which are subject to government regulation, and firm measures could be a matter of regulatory compliance (Fu and Geng, 2019 ). On the one hand, the limitation of firm engagement to compliance shows a lack of alignment of firm motivation with the goals. On the other hand, the compliance underlines the importance of achieving synergies between the SDGs and environmental policy ( Gusheva et al., 2022 ). Policy makers may rely on the SDGs as a policy-guiding instrument, and the widespread adoption of the SDGs lend legitimacy to policy initiatives that address these goals. The frequency of occurrence provided us with an estimate on RRI maturity level from unawareness through reactiveness towards proactive and strategic approaches (Stahl et al., 2017 ). Frequency above 90% was mapped to strategic approach, 70–90% proactive, 40–70% reactive and below 40% to an unawareness level. On specific goals of Decent work and economic growth, responsible consumption and production and partnership for goals, across the industry, companies show a strategic approach and higher maturity level on RRI scale. Proactive approaches were seen on goals which have direct relevance to specific industries for example, good health is well-being actively pursued in healthcare and financial industry, gender equality un retailing, hotel, restaurants, apparel industry, Industry Innovation and Infrastructure in Technology sector. Also, for the two goals on Sustainable Cities and Communities and Climate Action, proactive approach was observed across industry. No Poverty, Quality education, Clean water sanitation, Reduced Inequality, Life below Water and Life on Land show reactive approach by industry which could be due to several factors such as senior management focus, brand connect, CSR activities etc. For less popular goals, not having direct link to the industry focus areas like zero hunger, affordable and clean energy the maturity level is low at unawareness level. Only exception is the food and beverage industry which has a direct link to zero hunger SDG. The aim of the content analysis of corporate reports was to consider to what extent and in what way the SDGs are currently being addressed by corporations. The results have implications for research on sustainability reporting as well as RRI which are discussed below. We then discuss critical implications for practice. Finally, the limitations of the study are identified and contextualized in terms of opportunities for future studies.  5 Implications and future research This article aimed to contribute to the understanding of firm engagement in the UN SDGs. The findings have implications for research on sustainability reporting. The results show that 80% of the companies have implemented some form of sustainability reporting, either through a specific corporate sustainability report or through a chapter in the annual report and have been included in this investigation. Our cross-goal analysis has shown that firm engagement is centered in areas where government regulations are prominent, i.e. greenhouse gas emissions, workplace diversity, and safety. Financial benefits or public relations may be driving forces for framing compliance measures as SDG engagement (Aras and Crowther, 2009 ). Since the SDGs cover a broad range of topics, firms may use compliance with firm-friendly goals as a tool for green washing even though this is not always the case (Nishitani et al., 2021 ). Reporting should thus be developed to show when firms go beyond compliance and avoid the SDGs becoming a tool for green washing and similar practices. The analysis also has implications for RRI scholarship. Fig. 1   conceptualizes firm engagement in the SDGs as a constraint map for responsible research and innovation. For SDGs with low engagement e.g., SDG 2, 7, 10 and 15, the lack of firm action represents constraints to RRI implementation. One could argue that RRI in these areas may need to take into account constraint-based and frugal innovation which center on innovation processes subject to resource scarcity, which is a key issue not only in emerging markets (Agarwal et al., 2021 ; Brem et al., 2020 ). Some recent research also indicates that such frugal innovations can make an impact on SDGs (Ebolor et al., 2022 ). For SDGs with high engagement, e.g. SDG 3, 4, 5, 8, 11, 12, 13, and 16, large (and international) firms are in a better position to make significant RRI efforts. Compared to small and medium sized firms, large firms can better leverage their RRI efforts by acting in innovation ecosystems, so that the efforts are multiplied through the entrepreneurial efforts of other entities in the system (Nylund et al., 2021 ). Further results indicate that most corporate sustainability activities are centered on activities that improve company results or regulatory compliance. Our examination of the most used practice for each goal further substantiates the assumption that most sustainability measures are company or compliance centered (Table 3 ). This is also reflected in the cross-goal evaluation of the measures (Table 4 ). This indicates that companies are primarily involved in SDGs because they mostly benefit from their own investments. Against this background, many managers justify limiting their actions to only internal measures by saying that all general measures to promote sustainability and their implementation are the responsibility of the government and should be regulated by law (Kiron et al., 2017 ). As greenwashing is incresingly identified and may cause future reputational issues (Uyar et al., 2020 ), managers may want to assess those practices are implemented with a real impact on sustainable development. Every study has its limitations, and these limitations are good starting points for future research, which we outline in the following. First, no measures were assigned to two or more objectives, although sustainable measures could have several impacts. An example of which is the provision of affordable housing, which contributes to both Goal 1 and Goal 11. However, a clear delimitation of the measures is not completely possible. This is primarily due to the fact that several measures in effect work towards, due to many measures are cross-goal. Nonetheless, for the purposes of this project, a clear delimitation of the measures was made to allocate the goals to create a clear and unambiguous result. However, perhaps future investigations should consider multiple assignments of measures in order to investigate whether and how much the prioritization of the goals shifts. Moreover, the lack of standardization and consistency in corporate reporting across industries influenced the evaluation of this article. Reports that are 10–15 pages do not offer the depth or content provided by comprehensive reports with 200 pages. As a result, the measures taken by companies with extensive reports could be more effectively analyzed on average than companies with concise descriptions. A further limitation in evaluating the reports was the highly inconsistent level of information on the partnerships, which did not allow a meaningful analysis of this goal. Three quarters of the sampled companies are based in western countries, which can arguably be a result of their stricter sustainability-related regulations and legal requirements. This is evidenced by the investigation conducted by Faisal et al. (2020)  regarding the influence of government regulations on the sustainability of companies. As a result of such investigations, more political bodies have been adopted stricter regulations since the turn of the millennium to usher companies towards better sustainable practices (Zsolnai et al., 2009 , pp. 139–142). Furthermore, it is recommended to repeat the content analysis of company reports in a few years to investigate whether the measures and focus of the companies have changed. Finally, long-term studies could also offer interesting insights into the dynamics of firm engagement in the UN SDGs. Along with the other mentioned factors, this is a fruitful avenue for future research. The impact of SDGs on green washing is also a topic that merits further study. On the one hand, SDGs can foment RRI activities, and on the other hand they may be used as a tool for green washing. Future research could focus on the relative positive and negative impact, and on any modifications of SDGs that may reduce a malicious use of these tools. Finally, another limitation is that fulfilment of RRI characteristics (e.g. anticipation, responsiveness etc.) was not part of the analysis.  CRediT authorship contribution statement Petra A.
