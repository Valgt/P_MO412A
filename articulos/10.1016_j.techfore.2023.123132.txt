                  Ownership concentration (OC) has garnered scholarly attention because it may affect firms' governance, transparency and disclosure of issues related to the sustainable development goals (SDGs). This paper thus investigated the effect of the OC of institutional investors on the disclosure and transparency of firms' SDGs practices. To do so, a balanced data panel is employed; the sample is composed of 353 European listed companies and 1412 observations for the period 2018–2021. The results obtained underline the significant effects that various categories of institutional investors have on the disclosure and transparency of companies' SDGs practices and endeavours. Specifically, there appears to be a positive relationship between financial institutions' OC and SDG disclosure and transparency, as well as a negative relationship between the OC of foreign institutional investors, governments, cross-holdings and pension funds and organizations' SDGs disclosure and transparency. This study contributes to the growing literature on SDGs and institutional investors. Regarding managerial implications, this research highlights the role of institutional investors when seeking to promote environmental, social and ethical practices. The need for norms and legislation to foster adherence to companies' disclosure practices concerning SDGs is also highlighted.

Ownership concentration (OC) has garnered scholarly attention because it may affect firms' governance, transparency and disclosure of issues related to the sustainable development goals (SDGs). This paper thus investigated the effect of the OC of institutional investors on the disclosure and transparency of firms' SDGs practices. To do so, a balanced data panel is employed; the sample is composed of 353 European listed companies and 1412 observations for the period 2018–2021. The results obtained underline the significant effects that various categories of institutional investors have on the disclosure and transparency of companies' SDGs practices and endeavours. Specifically, there appears to be a positive relationship between financial institutions' OC and SDG disclosure and transparency, as well as a negative relationship between the OC of foreign institutional investors, governments, cross-holdings and pension funds and organizations' SDGs disclosure and transparency. This study contributes to the growing literature on SDGs and institutional investors. Regarding managerial implications, this research highlights the role of institutional investors when seeking to promote environmental, social and ethical practices. The need for norms and legislation to foster adherence to companies' disclosure practices concerning SDGs is also highlighted.

National and supranational institutions have thus acted upon this necessity to address these challenges in an attempt to promote socially responsible behaviours and strategies. The rising concerns of stakeholders have compelled companies to engage in corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices and behaviours (Dinçer et al., 2023 ). Scholars describe CSR as a way to implement strategies within organizations that include ethical codes of conduct and principles of social responsibility (Tiwari et al., 2023 ). In fact, CSR principles are often divided into the following three dimensions: transparency, accountability and sustainability (Tiwari et al., 2023 ). Transparency refers to a company's clear and open communication of their social and environmental activities. Accountability translates to companies taking responsibility for their activities and the impact of those activities, and sustainability refers to the integration of social, environmental and economic considerations into business processes and strategies (Tiwari et al., 2023 ). Initiatives such as the United Nations (UN) 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, the aim of which is to calibrate and guide entities' efforts towards sustainable and ethical practices, fall under the CSR umbrella (Dinçer et al., 2023 ). The Sustainable Development Agenda comprises 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that seek to ensure global prosperity, economic stability, responsible resource consumption and distribution, as well as sustainable development; to improve the human condition and to promote peace (Adams et al., 2020 ; UN, 2015 ). Corporations are of foremost importance to the pursuit of the SDGs not only because of their social and environmental impact but also due to their economic perspective in boosting prosperity in society and meeting individuals' needs for goods and services (Beck and Ferasso, 2023 ). Therefore, businesses must engage in socially responsible strategies to promote their CSR procedures and positively contribute to achieving the SDGs (Fernández-Vázquez and Sancho-Rodríguez, 2020 ). In an attempt to embolden investors' focus on social, environmental and ethical concerns, in 2016 the UN published the Principles for Responsible Investments (PRI), which sought to raise awareness of CSR issues and to encourage investor involvement and interest in companies' CSR (Cheng et al., 2022 ; Dyck et al., 2019 ). García-Sánchez et al. (2020c :1) describe the PRI as a “new game rules in the relationship of institutional investors with CSR transparency ”, which underlines the significance that the PRI has on investment strategy and the influence that many institutional investors might exercise over companies' pursuit and disclosure of firms' SDGs efforts. Even so, the PRI is not the sole cause of institutional investors' interest in companies' social, environmental and ethical practices. In fact, the scholarly literature has identified various motivational factors that influence institutional investors' awareness of CSR strategies and practices. First, there is empirical evidence which suggests that institutional investors attentiveness to firms' CSR stems from a genuine concern for our future and development (Amel-Zadeh and Serafeim, 2018 ) due to the continuous depletion of the world's resources and its dwindling habitability (Battisti et al., 2022 ; Nirino et al., 2021 ). Second, multiple authors have suggested that institutional investors' interest in companies' CSR is fostered by governments through continuous norms and legislation, as well as by pressure from the general public and the media (Cong et al., 2021 ; Parsa et al., 2021 ; Ren et al., 2022 ). Third, part of the literature has argued that institutional investors' interest in companies' CSR disclosure and performance is related to firms' ability to overcome distressing situations successfully, thus nurturing organizational resilience (Nirino et al., 2022 ). Fourth, empirical evidence suggests that institutional investors' interest in firms' CSR can be traced back to a financial performance discourse, as both scholars and professionals argue that CSR activities generate value for organizations (Dyck et al., 2019 ). Finally, the scholarly literature has suggested that investors are more likely to engage with companies practising CSR disclosure, because it helps reduce potential information asymmetries, so investors are able to make informed decisions because they possess a better understanding of the organization in which they intend to invest (Amel-Zadeh and Serafeim, 2018 ). On top of that, CSR transparency and disclosure help institutional investors further assess companies' risk exposure and long-term performance (Dyck et al., 2019 ; Lin et al., 2018 ). Due to the above-mentioned relationship that seems to exist between institutional investors and CSR information, several studies have attempted to deepen our current understanding of this potential interplay. Overall, current research has reported mixed empirical findings. Some researchers support the notion that the ownership concentration (OC) of institutional investors has a positive impact on the disclosure and transparency of firms' environmental, social and ethical practices and thus promotes organizations' CSR endeavours (Breitenstein et al., 2021 ; Cheng et al., 2022 ; Mishra, 2022 ). However, part of the literature supports the hypothesis that the OC of institutional investors negatively affects firms' CSR transparency and disclosure (Velte, 2023 ) or that investors' interest and monitoring activities are the real determinants of companies' engagement with CSR disclosure (Xiang et al., 2021 ). The contrasting and mixed evidence within the literature thus highlights the need for further research on the OC of institutional investors and organizations' transparency and disclosure of environmental, social and ethical factors. In so doing, researchers should further deepen our understanding of the possible causal relationship between the OC of institutional investors and organizational transparency and disclosure of CSR practices (Silva, 2021 ; Velte, 2023 ). The need for additional empirical research is particularly relevant when it comes to the exploration of a company's contribution to the SDGs (Silva, 2021 ; Sullivan et al., 2018 ). Our study thus sought to gather empirical evidence to contribute to filling this gap by exploring the relationship between the OC of institutional investors and firms; SDGs transparency and disclosure. Institutional investors are not a homogenous group; hence, their needs, preferences, time horizon and characteristics influence their stance on organizations' CSR transparency and disclosure (Aluchna et al., 2022 ; Beck and Ferasso, 2023 ). Therefore, following the work of García-Sánchez et al. (2020c) , the authors divided institutional investors into six categories (foreign institutional investors, governments, financial institutions, cross holdings, pension funds and “other” investors such as charities, indexers, mutual funds and insurance companies) to overcome the limitations normally associated with utilizing fewer dimensions of institutional investors (Velte, 2023 ). This study employed legitimacy theory as its theoretical framework. To carry out this empirical study, the authors employed regression analysis of a balanced data panel with a sample composed of over 300 companies whose headquarters are located in Europe. The sample consisted of observations spanning from 2018 to 2021. The empirical findings presented here report a positive and significant relationship between the OC of financial institutions and companies' SDGs transparency and disclosure (García-Meca and Pucheta-Martínez, 2018 ; García-Sánchez et al., 2020a ; Mishra, 2022 ). The results support previously published work that indicated a negative yet significant relationship between cross-holding OC and firms' SDGs disclosure practices (García-Sánchez et al., 2020a ; García-Sánchez et al., 2020c ; Kavadis and Thomsen, 2023 ). However, when it comes to other investors' OC, our empirical work challenges existing knowledge (García-Sánchez et al., 2020c ), which thus highlights the complex nature of the direct causality between various dimensions of institutional investors' OC and companies' SDGs disclosure practices (Rees and Rodionova, 2013 ). In fact, our empirical results suggest a non-significant effect between the OC of other investors and firms' SDGs transparency and disclosure. Finally, the obtained findings suggest a negative yet significant relationship between the OC of foreign institutional investors, governments and pension funds and organizations' SDGs disclosure, which diverges from the reported results of Dyck et al. (2019) , Mishra (2022) ; Kavadis and Thomsen (2023) , among other studies. The present study contributes to the literature on the OC of institutional investors and its influence on companies' transparency in their environmental, social and ethical practices and SDGs endeavours (Beck and Ferasso, 2023 ; García-Sánchez et al., 2022 ). First, the obtained results further contribute to the work of García-Sánchez et al. (2020c)  in underlining the importance and effect that separate categories of institutional investors have for companies' willingness to adopt CSR reporting and disclose SDG advancements. Second, our paper contributes to the literature which presents empirical findings supporting the hypothesis that the OC of several institutional investors positively influences companies' CSR reporting practices (Cheng et al., 2022 ; Velte, 2023 ). Third, this manuscript provides empirical evidence that highlights how legitimacy theory is an appropriate tool for investigating the effect of the OC of institutional investors on companies' transparency and disclosure of SDGs and CSR practices. Finally, our empirical findings could prove useful to policymakers seeking to design new legislation to promote SDGs transparency; for instance, ruling bodies may establish legislation which would nurture the OC of some institutional investors. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2  provides a brief contextual background, as well as developing the hypothesis of the paper. Section 3  presents the adopted empirical research framework, as well as the data source, collection process and the sample's descriptive statistics. Sections 4 and 5  contain the main findings of the study alongside a discussion. Finally, the last section contains the paper's implications, as well as its limitations and suggestions for future research avenues.  2 Literature review and hypothesis development 2.1 SDGs inherently challenge sustainable development Unprecedented challenges and concerns such as climate change, resource degradation and poverty led to the introduction of the UN SDGs in September 2015. The 17 integrated and indivisible goals are defined and detailed as non-quantitative targets (Mio et al., 2020 ). To achieve these goals, companies have to actively pursue business models that grant them the opportunity to overcome the challenges posed by the need to develop sustainably (Rosati and Faria, 2019b ). It is thus crucial for businesses to integrate SDGs practices and behaviours into their business strategy while also actively disclosing their contribution and progress on this front (Rosati and Faria, 2019a ). The UN has developed the SDG compass to guide and support companies as they try to align their strategies with the SDGs (GRI, UNGB and wbcsd, 2015 ). The SDG compass serves as a manual for organizations seeking to integrate sustainability within their organizational culture, as well as a guide to their SDG reporting practices (Verboven and Vanherck, 2016 ). Organizations thus have at their disposal a tool to guide their public disclosure practices and efforts to tackle SDG-related challenges (García-Sánchez et al., 2020c ; Rosati and Faria, 2019a ). Other ruling bodies are also pressuring larger companies to disclose the environmental, social and economic effects associated with their business operations (Folkens and Schneider, 2019 ). Directive 2014/95/EU (Directive 2014/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2014, 2014 ) was developed in an attempt to stress the importance of transparency and the disclosure of ethical, environmental and social risks through the reporting practices of both financial and non-financial organizations (Avrampou et al., 2019 ; Perello-Marin et al., 2022 ). Organizations have had to alter their corporate reporting practices to meet ruling bodies and stakeholders' demands and needs. Indeed, it is seen as vital for organizations to effectively communicate how their business operations are performing and contributing to social and environmental goals (Calabrese et al., 2021 ; Kraus et al., 2020 ). Stakeholders want corporations to properly report and disclose their adherence to sustainable development ambitions through SDG practices (García-Sánchez et al., 2020c ; Schramade, 2017 ). Stakeholder demands together with corporations' soaring interest and engagement in sustainability reports and CSR disclosure practices highlight the relevance of topics and thematic areas such as the one taken into consideration here (Moldavska and Welo, 2019 ; Rosati and Faria, 2019b ).  2.2 Theoretical underpinning and hypothesis development: legitimacy theory This paper draws on legitimacy theory, because it is considered a suitable theoretical underpinning for empirical studies investigating CSR and SDG reporting (Deegan, 2019 ). It has gained traction within social accounting and disclosure-based research focusing on the incentives for environmental, social and ethical disclosure (Akhter et al., 2023 ). Legitimacy theory is defined as “a mechanism that supports organizations in implementing and developing voluntary social and environmental disclosures in order to fulfill their social contract that enables the recognition of their objectives and the survival in a jumpy and turbulent environment” (Archel et al., 2009 :4). It postulates that businesses have an obligation towards society; to gain credibility and acceptance, organizations should thus modify their operations and behaviours to meet community demands (Li et al., 2018 ). Indeed, according to legitimacy theory, organizations should focus on meeting the expectations of investors and the general public (Akhter et al., 2023 ). Corporations employ various forms of communication to manage their legitimacy (Deegan, 2019 ), and reporting presents a prominent tool for communication to stakeholders (Silva, 2021 ). Legitimacy theory is employed here to explain organizations' engagement in reporting practices to disclose their environmental, social and ethical performance (Deegan, 2019 ; Silva, 2021 ). Various stakeholders are pressuring companies to contribute to the SDGs based on various motivations, which are presented in Table 1  , and the legitimacy of the organization may be threatened if the organization does not deal with these stakeholder expectations (Silva, 2021 ; Van Zanten and Van Tulder, 2018 ). Legitimacy is of particular relevance for the SDGs (Silva, 2021 ), so companies engage in reporting activities to improve their transparency, as well as to reduce potential information asymmetries (Fernandez-Feijoo et al., 2014 ; Hahn et al., 2015 ). Firms managing their legitimacy engage in symbolic disclosure, which encompasses changes made to their reporting presentation to enhance their reputation rather than actual operational and strategic changes (Wu et al., 2020 ), or substantive disclosure, which is understood as management and operational changes (Maas et al., 2016 ). Scholars postulate that legitimacy carries the risk of companies influencing stakeholders perceptions and opinions rather than focusing on actual change in their managerial and operational performance (Deegan, 2019 ). However, SDG legitimacy management helps corporate sustainability management link internal managerial practices and efforts with external communication through disclosure and transparency of environmental, social and ethical practices (Silva, 2021 ). This research therefore focuses on reporting practices, because the symbolic legitimization strategy should translate into substantive practices and efforts. Institutional investors, which are major stakeholders with a large amount of influence over companies' CSR commitment (McCahery et al., 2016 ), are considered prominent figures that must be addressed by companies if they seek to achieve legitimization (O'Donovan, 2002 ). Therefore, the pressure imposed by institutional investors on firms should foster companies' attentiveness to and disclosure of their CSR and SDG commitment and strategy. Following the work of García-Sánchez et al. (2020a, 2020c) , the authors of this study adopted six categories of institutional investors in an attempt to ensure comparability among various empirical findings underlined by the current body of literature. These six categories have been deemed necessary to overcome the limitations normally associated with fewer dimensions of institutional investors (Aluchna et al., 2022 ; Fich et al., 2015 ; Velte, 2023 ). To represent the involvement of institutional investors in a company, the concept of OC is employed here; OC represents the percentage of ownership held by a specific category of institutional investor (García-Sánchez et al., 2020a, 2020c ). For example, governments' OC of a company is represented by the percentage of ownership held by governmental entities. 2.2.1 Foreign institutional investors Foreign institutional investors are one of the categories of institutional investors identified in the current literature, as there is empirical evidence suggesting that these investors can influence the long-term corporate governance, innovativeness and investments of companies (Bena et al., 2017 ; Ferreira and Matos, 2008 ; Kavadis and Thomsen, 2023 ). Foreign investors will also lean towards the promotion of CSR in companies in which they are invested to reduce the potential information asymmetry (Oh et al., 2011 ). Foreign institutional investors often lack close relationships with firms, so it is in their interest to promote and implement behaviours in firms that help safeguard their position (Bena et al., 2017 ; Ferreira and Matos, 2008 ). The lack of a close relationship between organizations and foreign institutional investors creates a stronger need for disclosure, because these investors have to make decisions based on the reports produced by the firms (Ferreira et al., 2017 ). In fact, there is empirical evidence to suggest that domestic institutional investors have shown patterns that indicate an information advantage (Ferreira et al., 2017 ). These findings further underline the need for foreign institutional investors to address such informational gaps. Foreign institutional investors also tend to have a global business vision; so their OC sets higher expectations on companies to present social and environmental information in their reports (Correa-Garcia et al., 2020 ). On top of that, firms seeking to legitimize their position to foreign institutional investors due to informational asymmetries (Bena et al., 2017 ) may be motivated to engage in CSR disclosure, because it strengthens dialogue and disclosure by reducing those potential information asymmetries (Fernando and Lawrence, 2014 ). Foreign institutional investors' OC should thus promote organizations' interest in strengthening their transparency and SDG disclosure practices. The following hypothesis is thus proposed:H1 : Foreign institutional investors' OC has a positive relationship with companies' pursuit and disclosure of the SDGs.    2.2.2 Governments Governments' investment strategies are often targeted towards the pursuit of social and environmental welfare and development (García-Sánchez et al., 2020a ; García-Sánchez et al., 2020c ). Normally, governments do not chase profit but rather have a long term investment orientation while also evaluating and considering ethical, social and environmental issues (Eng and Mark, 2003 ; Rees and Rodionova, 2013 ). Due to their focus on sustainable and ethical practices, governments positively affect companies' disclosure of CSR information (Ananzeh et al., 2022 ; Kavadis and Thomsen, 2023 ; Prado-Lorenzo et al., 2009 ), as well as ethical and responsible investment practices (Motta and Uchida, 2018 ). Thus, considering the empirical evidence, which suggests that government participation positively influences corporate sustainability and transparency (Rees and Rodionova, 2013 ), it is possible to assume that governments would promote companies' social, ethical and environmental behaviours and disclosure (García-Sánchez et al., 2020a ; Li and Zhang, 2010 ). Indeed, companies may engage in CSR and SDG reporting practices to legitimize their business to governments due to their concerns about these issues (Ananzeh et al., 2022 ; Deegan, 2019 ; Wang and Zhang, 2022 ). However, it is important to note that some studies have underlined the lack of a relationship between government ownership and companies' pursuit of CSR (e.g., Dam and Scholtens, 2012 ; García-Sánchez et al., 2020c ). It is therefore necessary to further explore whether governmental ownership has a positive relationship with CSR. Despite the contradictory findings within the literature, the present authors are in favour of the positive effects that government OC has on CSR and SDG due to governments' continuous commitment to social, environmental and ethical development (García-Sánchez et al., 2020a ; García-Sánchez et al., 2020c ). Moreover, by taking into account legitimacy theory and the information presented in Section 2.2 , it seems likely that governments' OC may have a positive effect on companies' disclosure of SDGs practices. Thus, the following hypothesis has thus been formulated:H2 : Governments' OC has a positive relationship with companies' pursuit and disclosure of the SDGs.    2.2.3 Cross holdings Institutional investors often use equity ownership to exercise control over interrelated firms (He et al., 2019 ), which greatly incentivizes these investors to manage the firms within their investment portfolio by controlling and improving companies' governance (Harford et al., 2011 ), because there are high agency costs associated with the nonalignment of interests within cross holdings (Ojo, 2013 ). Empirical evidence suggests that companies' cross holdings have a negative effect on CSR and its three main dimensions of social, environmental and corporate governance (Rees and Rodionova, 2013 ). This is because those investors tend to influence firms to promote their own ambitions rather than long-term benefits through CSR (García-Sánchez et al., 2020a ; García-Sánchez et al., 2020c ; Kavadis and Thomsen, 2023 ). Indeed, cross holdings tend to exercise a greater degree of control through high levels of OC, as the parent company diminishes the decision-making power of other investors (Correa-Garcia et al., 2020 ). High degrees of ownership by parent companies have a negative relationship with CSR transparency and disclosure, because the parent company establishes policies and processes that are beneficial to the group vision rather than to other investors and external stakeholders, such as legitimization practices through CSR disclosure and transparency (Correa-Garcia et al., 2020 ; Ducassy and Montandrau, 2015 ). Nonetheless, non-confirmatory findings are presented within the empirical results of García-Sánchez et al. (2020c) , so it is necessary to gather substantial additional evidence to clarify how cross holdings affect companies' pursuit and disclosure of SDGs. However, based on the literature concerning the degree of control in cross holdings and the lack of interest from parent companies to engage in legitimization practices through CSR and SGDs disclosure, the authors developed the following hypothesis:H3 : Cross holdings' OC has a negative relationship with companies' pursuit and disclosure of SDGs.    2.2.4 Financial institutions García-Sánchez et al. (2020c)  categorized banks and trust institutions as “financial institutions”, so to maintain consistency across different empirical studies, the authors adhere to this categorization. There are contrasting views concerning the investment strategy and influence financial institutions have on companies (Velte, 2023 ). First, due to rigorous regulations (Kim and Yi, 2015 ) and public scrutiny (Hu and Scholtens, 2014 ), financial institutions tend to put a stronger emphasis on socially responsible behaviours (Mishra, 2022 ; Sharif and Rashid, 2014 ). Consequently, these expectations and regulatory forces thus tend to promote the adoption of CSR practices by the companies in which financial institutions invest (García-Meca and Pucheta-Martínez, 2018 ; Motta and Uchida, 2018 ). Financial institutions often act as lenders for companies, as well, so they are incentivized to promote CSR-related actions to improve companies' value and reduce their associated risks (García-Sánchez et al., 2020c ; Mishra, 2022 ). However, there are empirical findings which underline the short-term orientation that financial institutions have (Kim and Yi, 2015 ; Oh et al., 2011 ), and this short-term orientation does not favour efforts towards the adoption and application of CSR actions, which materialize in the long term (Kavadis and Thomsen, 2023 ; Pucheta-Martínez and Chiva-Ortells, 2018 ). In fact, earlier research has found no effect between financial entities' ownership and companies' socially responsible behaviours (Dam and Scholtens, 2012 ; García-Sánchez et al., 2020c ; Johnson and Greening, 1999 ). Despite the conflict that exists within the current state of the art, the authors of this paper believe that companies held by financial investors show improved CSR pursuit and disclosure, and this is supported by empirical findings obtained in many studies (García-Meca and Pucheta-Martínez, 2018 ; García-Sánchez et al., 2020a ; Khan et al., 2009 ; Oh et al., 2011 ; Mishra, 2022 ; Rees and Rodionova, 2013 ; Rees et al., 2012 ). Moreover, the notion that financial institutions' OC should enhance companies' transparency and disclosure of CSR and SDGs is further supported by legitimacy theory, because financial institutions have to conform to rigorous legislation, regulations and social norms and beliefs imposed by various stakeholders (Ben Fatma and Chouaibi, 2021 ). Therefore, the following hypothesis has been formulated:H4 : Financial institutions' OC has a positive relationship with companies' pursuit and disclosure of the SDGs.    2.2.5 Pension funds Pensions funds are notorious for their long-term investment horizon, which allows them to support CSR actions within the companies held in their portfolio (Oh et al., 2011 ; Velte, 2023 ). Pension funds monitor companies to ensure their long-term growth; this can be achieved through CSR actions and accountability (Kavadis and Thomsen, 2023 ; Sethi, 2005 ). There is empirical evidence to support the positive relationship between pension funds and companies' social and environmental performance (Dyck et al., 2019 ; García-Sánchez et al., 2020a ; García-Sánchez et al., 2020c ; Rees et al., 2012 ; Rees and Rodionova, 2013 ; Velte, 2023 ). Pension funds are, by nature, under a great deal of scrutiny from both governments and the public to pursue investments in virtuous companies that value social and environmental impact and performance (Dyck et al., 2019 ; García-Sánchez et al., 2020a ; Mishra, 2022 ; Oh et al., 2011 ). Indeed, pension funds often shun away from investing in “sin shares” linked to activities such as tobacco, weapons and gambling (Hong and Kacperczyk, 2009 ). Pension funds' OC may nurture the legitimization processes of companies through holistic interpretation of beneficiaries' interests and demands for both non-financial and financial disclosure (Alda, 2021 ; Hoepner and Schopohl, 2020 ). The following hypothesis has thus been formulated:H5 : Pension funds' OC has a positive relationship with companies' pursuit and disclosure of the SDGs.    2.2.6 Other investors Despite the range addressed by the categories mentioned above, many studies have identified and investigated an even larger array of institutional investors (Velte, 2023 ). Following the work of García-Sánchez et al. (2020c) , the authors adopted thus a sixth category to include the remaining type of investors, because they often constitute a smaller portion of the ownership of the companies sampled within this study. First, there is empirical evidence to suggest a potentially positive relationship between institutional investors' OC through index funds (indexers) and companies' disclosure of CSR behaviours and policies (Chen et al., 2020 ; Boone and White, 2015 ), because indexers often seek to minimize costs associated with their transactional behaviours. It has thus been argued that lower informational asymmetry lowers transactional and monitoring costs (Boone and White, 2015 ). Second, some charities are believed to be institutional investors that pursue investments in companies that align with their values, which constitutes an investment policy aimed at acquiring ownership over companies with a strong focus on CSR (Sparkes and Cowton, 2004 ). Charities also have to obey the demands of governments and legislative entities, which often require them to increase their social responsibility through CSR reporting activities to legitimize their own efforts and improve their transparency (Ahunov, 2023 ; Hooks and Stent, 2019 ). This empirical evidence thus supports the notion that charities' OC of companies would promote transparency and disclosure of CSR practices. Third, insurance companies long-term investors, in much the same way as pension funds (Nguyen et al., 2020 ): Insurance companies' investment horizon forces them to manage long-term risks. Thus, insurance companies' organizational culture nurtures companies' socially responsible practices and good governance to ensure business continuity, social growth and inclusive growth (Ullah et al., 2019 ). Insurance companies can profoundly affect society, because they can promote sustainable practices and social well-being, and they are incentivized to engage in legitimization activities to respond to the expectations and concerns of various stakeholders (Ullah et al., 2019 ). Nonetheless, there is empirical evidence to suggest that there is a positive relationship between insurance companies' OC and companies' social and environmental performance and disclosure (Cox et al., 2004 ; Kavadis and Thomsen, 2023 ); although supplemental empirical findings indicate that no significant relationship between the two exists (Oh et al., 2011 ). This misalignment in the research findings highlights the necessity to investigate the potential relationship between insurance companies and CSR transparency. Finally, there are investment/mutual funds, which are concerned with clients' interests. Such long-term institutional investors focus on building an investment portfolio composed of companies that are socially and environmentally responsible in an attempt to promote long-term profitability and resilience and to meet stakeholders' expectations and demands concerning environmental, social and ethical issues (Chen et al., 2020 ; García-Sánchez et al., 2020a ; Kavadis and Thomsen, 2023 ; Velte, 2023 ). Overall, studies conducted on these types of institutional investors tend to underline a positive relationship between their OC and CSR practices. From a theoretical standpoint, the institutional investors included within this section are incentivized by stakeholder expectations and demands for legitimization through social accounting and disclosure of CSR and SDGs practices. Therefore, the following hypothesis has been developed:H6 : “Other” institutional investors' OC has a positive relationship with companies' pursuit and disclosure of the SDGs.      3 Materials and methods 3.1 Research design and sample The sample corresponds to a balanced panel of data consisting of 1412 observations related to 353 European firms between 2018 and 2021. The sample is conditioned and limited to the information provided by the Thomson Reuters database. Use of the Thomson Reuters DataStream is appropriate due to its common use within published papers and research (Emma and Jennifer, 2021 ; García-Sánchez et al., 2020b ; García-Sánchez et al., 2020c ; Mishra, 2022 ; Nirino et al., 2021 ). From a geographical perspective, the authors decided to focus on European companies due to their greater focus on sustainability and other CSR attitudes (Emma and Jennifer, 2021 ). Table 2   details the sample composition. Banks and insurance companies were removed from the initial dataset, because those entities must comply with different accounting standards (Doni et al., 2019 ). By including such companies, the researchers would incur the risk of distorting the obtained results (Doni et al., 2019 ). Companies whose data concerning SDGs and/or institutional ownership were not available were also excluded.  3.2 Description of variables First, the Thomson Reuters database was used to gather information concerning companies' disclosure of SDGs. However, the platform provides this measure as a string, so companies' SDGs disclosure has been transformed into a numerical variable to indicate whether companies disclose a specific SDG (1) or whether they do not (0). An additional variable named aggregate SDG score has also been created; this is determined by the sum of a company's SDGs disclosure for a specific financial year. The present study's independent variable consists of data concerning institutional investors' OC (Mishra, 2022 ), which has been retrieved from the Thomson Reuters database. The authors of the paper have utilized Thomson Reuters' investor subcategories to divide the various institutional ownership percentages into the six categories outlined in the previous section. Table 3   lists which Refinitiv subcategories have been considered for each dimension of the institutional investors' OC variable. In an attempt to overcome the limitations of previous studies (Fich et al., 2015 ; García-Sánchez et al., 2020c ; Mishra, 2022 ; Oh et al., 2011 ; Rees and Rodionova, 2013 ; Velte, 2023 ), the authors have included all institutional investors that have a stake within a firm; hence, no ownership percentage exclusion criteria have been set. Finally, based on previous studies, the following control variables (Table 4  ) have been included in an attempt to avoid biased results (Amorelli and García-Sánchez, 2020 ; García-Sánchez et al., 2020b ; Mishra, 2022 ; Przychodzen and Przychodzen, 2015 ; Tsai and Liao, 2017 ). The chosen variables have been deemed relevant because they have been used in prior research in the field of business and management.  3.3 Research design This study used the following baseline regression models to determine the association between corporations' SDG disclosure and the OC of institutional investors:SDGaggregatte it  = α 0  + β 1  ForeignOC + Controls + ε    SDGaggregatte it  = α 0  + β 1  GovernmentOC + Controls + ε    SDGaggregatte it  = α 0  + β 1  CrossOC + Controls + ε    SDGaggregatte it  = α 0  + β 1  FinancialOC + Controls + ε    SDGaggregatte it  = α 0  + β 1  PensionOC + Controls + ε    SDGaggregatte it  = α 0  + β 1  OtherOC + Controls + ε     These baseline regression model equations take into consideration SDGaggregate as its dependent variable and ForeignOC, GovernmentOC, CrossOC, FinancialOC, PensionOC and OtherOC as its independent variables. These equations were designed to estimate the association of companies' SDG disclosure with the OC of various forms of institutional investors. In all specifications, the authors controlled for firm and time variables (controls). All control variables are described in Table 4 .   4 Results 4.1 Descriptive statistics The following section contains the descriptive statistics and the correlations between the various variables utilized within the present study (Table 5  ). The dependent variable, SDGaggregate, shows an average value of 4.73 with a standard deviation of 4.55. For the independent variables, ForeignOC stands at 0.40 with a standard deviation of 0.87; the mean for GovernmentOC is 0.04, with a standard deviation of 0.17. The third independent variable (CrossOC) has a mean value of 0.72 and a standard deviation of 0.10. FinancialOC has a mean of 0.09 with a standard deviation of 0.25. PensionOC has a mean of 0.03 and a standard deviation of 0.15. Finally, OtherOC has a mean of 0.01 with a standard deviation of 0.07. To test the correlation between the variables employed by this study, Pearson's correlation was performed, as shown in Table 6  . The results indicate that the chosen variables do not have a high degree of correlation. It is thus safe to assume that the data in the present study should not pose multicollinearity problems (Allen, 1997 ). The OCs of governments, foreign institutional investors, pension funds and “other” institutional investors are also negatively correlated with companies' SDG aggregate score, which does not support our hypotheses 1, 2, 5 and 6. The OC of financial institutions and companies' SDG disclosure are, however, positively correlated, which is consistent with our hypothesis 4. Finally, the OC of cross holdings is negatively correlated with companies' SDG aggregate score, which is consistent with our hypothesis 3.  4.2 Empirical findings We established panel data to test the research hypotheses developed in Section 2 . We control for year and firm fixed effects in Columns (1), (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) to observe the impact that the various dimensions of institutional ownership might have on companies' SDG aggregate score. Table 7   presents the empirical results obtained in the baseline regression analysis. The results of Model (1) suggest that foreign institutional investors (b = −1.58; p < 0.1) have a negative yet significant impact on companies' SDG transparency. Additionally, the empirical results obtained from Model (2) also suggest that a negative but significant relationship exists between companies' SDGs disclosure and governmental ownership (b = −5.96; p < 0.01). Therefore, hypotheses 1 and 2 cannot be confirmed, because the obtained empirical results report a negative relationship between the variables included in the first two hypotheses. Model (3) confirms the negative relationship between cross holdings (b = −3.16; p < 0.01) ownership and companies' CSR-related practices, so hypothesis 3 is confirmed. Model (4) tests the impact that the OC of financial institutions has on companies' SDG aggregate score, and the results suggest that financial institutions (b = 1.70; p < 0.1) have a positive and significant impact on companies' disclosure concerning SDGs; thus, hypothesis 4 can be accepted. Finally, the empirical results for Models (5) and (6) suggest that neither pension funds (b = −3.53; p < 0.01) nor “other” institutional investors (b = −1.06; p > 0.1) have a positive effect on firms' SDGs disclosure. The baseline regression model results concerning “other” institutional investors' OC are not, however, significant. Consequently, hypothesis 5 cannot be accepted, whereas the model for hypothesis 6 indicates that there is no association between SDGaggregate and OtherOC.  4.3 Additional robustness checks As noted by de Jong and van der Meer (2017)  and Ho et al. (2012) , different geographical and national contexts can greatly influence companies' and investors' sentiment towards CSR and SDGs practices. Consequently, each specific national context could exert a different pressure on investors to promote CSR practices and ambitions. The following additional tests were therefore conducted. Table 8   presents the results obtained from the regression model which excludes companies whose headquarters are in the United Kingdom, because those companies represent above 30 % of the sample in this study. The obtained results underline the significance of Models (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5). Specifically, Model 1 (b = −1.37; p < 0.1), Model 2 (b = −5.73; p < 0.01), Model 3 (b = −2.98; p < 0.01) and Model 5 (b = −3.01; p < 0.01) have a negative and significant impact, which underlines the negative effect of the OC of foreign investors, governments, cross holdings and pension funds on companies' SDGs disclosure (SDGaggregate). Model 4 (b = 2.07; p < 0.1), however, shows a positive and significant effect, which further corroborates the notion that the OC of financial institutional investors have a positive effect on companies' SDG disclosure. Finally, Model 6 (b = −1.56; p > 0.1) is not significant, which underlines the lack of association between “other” institutional investors' OC and companies' SDGs disclosure. Additionally, the scholarly literature indicates how generic categories of institutional investors can be associated with different investment time horizons (García-Sánchez et al., 2020c ). Their influence and interest in SDGs practices may therefore differ based on their attitudes towards long- and short-term investment strategies (Brossard et al., 2013 ). Due to their potential differences in influence over companies' SDGs transparency, a more in depth analysis was therefore conducted of the effects that long-term (e.g. pension funds, governments, financial institutions and foreign institutional investors) and short-term (e.g. cross-holdings and “other” institutional investors) institutional investors have on companies' SDGs' disclosure (García-Sánchez et al., 2020a ). Table 9   indicates the results obtained from the regression conducted with these two types of institutional investors OC based on their investment time horizons. The results presented in Table 9  highlight how the OC of both long- and short-term institutional investors has a negative effect on companies' SDG practices, which contrasts with previous empirical evidence (García-Sánchez et al., 2020a ). Nonetheless, it is possible to observe how the OC of short-term institutional investors has a stronger negative impact on companies' SDG disclosure. The obtained results could thus further delineate the need for scholars to further explore how short- and long-term investors affect companies' SDG transparency. 4.3.1 Addressing endogeneity effects This empirical analysis could be subject to endogeneity bias resulting from omitted variables, measurements errors and reverse causality. For instance, institutional investors' OC and companies' SDG aggregate score could be driven by omitted variables that simultaneously affect SDG practices and companies' ownership structure, or reverse causality could be involved, in which organizations with a high degree of SDG commitment attract certain types of institutional investors. Therefore, in an attempt to address these endogeneity concerns, propensity score matching (PSM) was used, along with other robustness checks.  4.3.2 Propensity score matching To eliminate potential differences between the contexts of the various countries, the authors of this paper analysed the influence that the OC of institutional investors has on companies' SDG disclosure using samples matched by their propensity to have similar characteristics (Attig and Cleary, 2014 ). The selected sample was thus divided into various subsamples. The first subsample consisted of firms located in countries with a higher degree of institutional investor OC through a dummy variable with the value 1 (CountryIVOC = 1). The second subsample was composed of firms located in countries with lower degrees of institutional investor OC through a dummy variable with the value 0 (CountryIVOC = 0). We then matched the sample based on propensity scores estimated from the model with CountryIVOC as the dependent variable and the other variables employed within the baseline model as independent variables. Table 10   presents the results obtained from the balance test on matching variables. It is possible to observe that there is no statistical difference between the two subsamples, which verifies the validity of the authors' matching. Table 11   presents the regression results obtained from the matched subsamples. Columns (1), (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) of Table 11  report the baseline results obtained from the regression model obtained from the matched samples.    5 Discussion This empirical research explored the relationship between the OC of institutional investors and companies' SDG transparency and disclosure. A regression model was employed through a balanced data panel. This study used data retrieved from European listed companies between 2018 and 2021. Institutional investors were divided into various dimensions to provide a comprehensive view of the effects that the OC of various institutional investors may have on companies' SDGs disclosure practices. Moreover, six different categories of institutional investors were adopted to overcome potential limitations normally associated with fewer dimensions of institutional investors, as well as to improve the comparability of the obtained empirical findings with previous scholarly literature (Beck and Ferasso, 2023 ; Breitenstein et al., 2021 ; Cheng et al., 2022 ; García-Sánchez et al., 2020b ; García-Sánchez et al., 2020c ; Mishra, 2022 ; Velte, 2023 ). Companies communicate sustainability, ethical and social endeavours, such as SDG practices, to reflect their aspirations (Christensen et al., 2021 ). The symbolic presentation of SDG practices thus does translate into substantive efforts. Supported by legitimacy theory, this study is grounded in the idea that SDG reporting practices translate into companies' add-on or core business activities to reach the SDGs (Silva, 2021 ). This empirical research revealed that the OC of financial institutions has a positive impact on companies SDG disclosure, which is in line with previous scholarly publications (Akhter et al., 2023 ; García-Meca and Pucheta-Martínez, 2018 ; García-Sánchez et al., 2020a ; Khan et al., 2009 ; Oh et al., 2011 ; Mishra, 2022 ; Sharif and Rashid, 2014 ). Organizations with greater control and ownership from financial institutions are more likely to present reports disclosing SDG practices. The literature has identified several elements as key drivers of financial institutions' efforts towards promoting transparency regarding CSR and SDG practices. First, financial institutions have to conform to stringent regulations, social norms and beliefs, so they are incentivized to promote CSR and SDG transparency to legitimize organizations and meet the demands and expectations of various stakeholders (Ben Fatma and Chouaibi, 2021 ; Hu and Scholtens, 2014 ; Kim and Yi, 2015 ). This notion corroborates the legitimacy theoretical lens adopted within this study, because societal expectations and beliefs influence financial institutions' socially responsible behaviours and actions (García-Meca and Pucheta-Martínez, 2018 ; Motta and Uchida, 2018 ; Mishra, 2022 ; Sharif and Rashid, 2014 ). Second, financial institutions encourage CSR and SDG practices because doing so helps them evaluate companies' resilience and associated risks (García-Sánchez et al., 2020c ; Mishra, 2022 ). Third, CSR-related actions tend to improve companies' valuation, so financial institutions are incentivized to nurture CSR and SDG practices to promote company value and reduce associated risks (García-Sánchez et al., 2020c ; Mishra, 2022 ). Finally, our results are consistent with Mishra (2022) , who established that financial institutions are long-term investors, so they generally encourage companies to pursue long-term investments such as those associated with CSR and SDG practices (Mishra, 2022 ). Our results are consistent with the scholarly literature on the negative effects of cross holdings' OC on company transparency and disclosure of SDG practices (García-Sánchez et al., 2020a ; García-Sánchez et al., 2020c ; Kavadis and Thomsen, 2023 ; Rees and Rodionova, 2013 ). Cross-holdings' OC is employed to exercise control over interrelated firms (He et al., 2019 ), to reduce agency costs (Ojo, 2013 ) and to control companies' governance and investment portfolio (Harford et al., 2011 ) to promote cross-holdings' own ambitions (Rees and Rodionova, 2013 ), rather than focusing on the long-term benefits associated with CSR practices (García-Sánchez et al., 2020a ; García-Sánchez et al., 2020c ; Kavadis and Thomsen, 2023 ). Higher levels of OC by cross holdings might translate into lower quality standards in presenting CSR and SDG practices (Correa-Garcia et al., 2020 ). Cross holdings also tend to exercise high degrees of control because of their disposition to maintain a majority stake in companies; the parent company is thus able to counteract other investors' ambitions (Correa-Garcia et al., 2020 ), which might be aimed at promoting CSR actions and legitimization (Ducassy and Montandrau, 2015 ). High degrees of ownership by a parent company thus shifts managerial efforts towards establishing behaviours, projects and policies that are beneficial to the group rather than to the legitimization needs of other stakeholders (Correa-Garcia et al., 2020 ). Finally, cross holdings with high degrees of OC tend to suffer low degrees of information asymmetry because of their dominant position, which grants them access to the information they need (Correa-Garcia et al., 2020 ). The parent company is thus generally less interested in directing resources towards voluntary information disclosure related to CSR and SDG. Our results contradict previously published work on the positive effect of the OC of foreign institutional investors, pension funds, governments and “other” institutional investors on CSR and SDG disclosure. First, our empirical results do not align with published empirical studies (Dyck et al., 2019 ; García-Sánchez et al., 2020c ; Oh et al., 2011 ), as the regression analysis presented here indicates that there is a negative relationship between foreign institutional investors' OC and SDG disclosure. This discrepancy might suggest that foreign institutional investors might reduce potential information asymmetries (Oh et al., 2011 ) by prioritizing other forms of informational disclosure instead of focusing on SDG transparency (Phillips et al., 2023 ). The obtained empirical evidence also might suggest that foreign institutional investors are less likely to be affected by societal pressure and beliefs to pursue CSR and SDG practices to legitimize companies in which they have invested. Foreign institutional investors' country of origin and cultural background may thus influence their predisposition to pursue CSR and SDG actions. The propositions in the previous paragraph might also be applicable to the OC of pension funds (Alda, 2021 ). In fact, despite the results in previously published articles (Dyck et al., 2019 ; García-Sánchez et al., 2020a ; García-Sánchez et al., 2020c ; Rees et al., 2012 ; Rees and Rodionova, 2013 ; Velte, 2023 ), this manuscript found a negative relationship between the OC of pension funds and companies SDG disclosure. On top of the foregoing proposition, pension funds' OC might negatively affect companies SDG disclosure due to their fiduciary duties, which aim is to maximize their portfolio value, often at the expense of CSR and SDG actions (García-Sánchez et al., 2020c ). Pension funds' focus on value maximization might thus push them to direct capital and resources towards strengthening organizations financial performance instead of CSR and SDG practices, which are perceived as riskier long-term investments (García-Sánchez et al., 2020b ). Third, our empirical results do not coincide with previous empirical evidence concerning the effects of governments' OC on CSR and SDG disclosure (García-Sánchez et al., 2020a ; Kavadis and Thomsen, 2023 ; Prado-Lorenzo et al., 2009 ). The present study found a negative relationship between governments' OC and SDG disclosure. In fact, scholars have indicated how inefficient governance structures due to high government ownership might slow down companies' decision-making systems due to bureaucracy and political disputes, which would hinder organizations' pursuit of CSR and SDG practices (Jiao et al., 2015 ; Muttakin and Subramaniam, 2015 ). Higher degrees of governments' OC might also pressure companies towards short-term goals over SDG ambitions to support governments' short-term political agenda (Wu et al., 2011 ). These dimensions of institutional investors might also negatively affect companies SDG disclosure and actions because of limited expertise, resources and guidance. It is challenging for entities to link the SDGs to CSR-related actions which seamlessly blend within the core business activities (Silva, 2021 ). These institutional investors might thus struggle to reframe firms core activities which have a meaningful impact on companies' management and operations (Shabana and Ravlin, 2016 ). Finally, previous empirical studies have found a positive relationship between the “other” institutional investors dimension and companies' environmental, social and ethical information disclosure (Boone and White, 2015 ; Chen et al., 2020 ; Kavadis and Thomsen, 2023 ; Nguyen et al., 2020 ; Sparkes and Cowton, 2004 ). However, our results indicated a negative and non-significant relationship between “other” institutional investors' OC and companies' SDG disclosure. 5.1 Theoretical contributions From a theoretical point of view, the obtained results expand the discourse concerning the effect that institutional investors' OC has on companies' disclosure and transparency related to SDG practices. It also makes a key contribution to the scholarly literature investigating the effects that various groups of institutional investors have on firms' disclosure. Indeed, by presenting empirical bodies of work that divide institutional investors into their various identified dimensions, it is possible to further understand the contradictory results previously published (Beck and Ferasso, 2023 ; Breitenstein et al., 2021 ; Cheng et al., 2022 ; García-Sánchez et al., 2020b ; García-Sánchez et al., 2020c ; Mishra, 2022 ; Velte, 2023 ). Finally, this empirical research furthers our current understanding of legitimacy theory, because some institutional investors do not place a strong emphasis on companies' SDG disclosure practices, despite the demands of external entities and stakeholders (Deegan, 2019 ). The obtained findings further contribute to the scholarly literature on the need for various businesses to legitimize their organization through social accounting reporting practices (Akhter et al., 2023 ). In fact, we can postulate that some institutional investors may exercise a stronger need for companies to function within the norms and bounds of society to legitimize their organization and ensure its survival (Fernando and Lawrence, 2014 ). For example, our empirical results indicate that financial institutions' OC has a positive effect on companies' SDG disclosure; hence, those entities might positively respond to social norms and governmental legislation to pursue ethical, social and environmental ambitions (Silva, 2021 ) by engaging in both substantive and symbolic legitimization (Wu et al., 2020 ). Other forms of institutional investors, meanwhile, might emphasize companies' risk management, long-term profitability and resilience (see the table in Section 2.2 ) through substantive practices aimed at promoting operational and managerial changes towards social, ethical and environmental dimensions (Deegan, 2019 ; Maas et al., 2016 ). Moreover, the lack of symbolic disclosure from companies might suggest difficulties in promoting substantive changes concerning their SDG practices and contributions (Silva, 2021 ). Investors and organizations might struggle, in particular, to link SDGs to CSR-related activities. Companies might therefore end up focusing on practices which are outside the core business, thus reducing managerial and operational contribution to SDGs (Shabana and Ravlin, 2016 ). This implies that most companies and institutional investors lack indications and guidance for change to nurture SDG ambitions.  5.2 Practical contributions In terms of practical implications, the obtained results could prove useful to organizations and entities seeking to promote environmental, social and ethical disclosure through the pursuit of the 2030 UN Agenda (Centobelli et al., 2020 ; García-Sánchez et al., 2020c ; Mishra, 2022 ; Rosati and Faria, 2019a, 2019b ; Velte, 2023 ). Organizations and entities could postulate norms and legislation to foster institutional investors' adherence and attention to promote companies' interests in disclosure of CSR practices as well as SDGs (Cong et al., 2021 ; Cox et al., 2004 ; Parsa et al., 2021 ; Ren et al., 2022 ). Second, the presented results could prove useful to companies seeking to engage and attract specific groups of institutional investors, as well as for managing their relationship with those investors groups (García-Sánchez et al., 2020c ). Third, the use of legitimization strategies to contribute to CSR and SDGs underlines the need for legislative entities and governments to develop norms and tools which support companies' substantive changes (Dahlmann et al., 2019 ). Stakeholder pressure and social norms might not be sufficient to promote SDG practices, because organizations might struggle to find ways to implement SDGs within their core business activities (Shabana and Ravlin, 2016 ). While this manuscript centred on companies' reports, some might argue that it does not directly indicate internal management commitment towards SDGs and other social, ethical and environmental practices. Finally, the obtained empirical results indicate the necessity for companies to strengthen their engagement in transforming their business models and SDG compliance; this might highlight potential new opportunities for corporations to generate additional revenue and establish new business models through SDG practices and investments (Van Zanten and Van Tulder, 2018 ). This should be of particular interest for institutional investors, because it might provide capital gains on top of legitimacy and the advantages previously discussed in Section 2.2 .  5.3 Limitations and avenues for future research The present paper contains the following limitations, which also offer opportunities for future research. First, the sample and observations were extracted from companies operating within Europe. Additionally, the study's sample did not include firms such as banks and insurance companies. Thus, the empirical findings cannot be generalized to organizations operating within a different geographical or industrial context. Consequently, future studies might want to target companies listed in countries or geographical areas in which sustainability is not as much of a concern as for European companies (Emma and Jennifer, 2021 ) so as to better explore the relationship between institutional investors and SDG disclosure. In so doing, future researchers should be able to gather empirical evidence concerning the potential effects that social norms and stakeholder demands have in promoting social accounting disclosure. The previously mentioned research gap could prove useful for further investigating the effects that policies and legislation have on both ownership and CSR transparency (Cong et al., 2021 ; Dyck et al., 2019 ). Second, the present study used a dummy variable, which simply indicated whether a company disclosed information concerning the various SDGs. Additional studies should investigate the different impact that various types of disclosure might have on institutional ownership. In so doing, future researchers should be able to better understand what elements and types of disclosure affect institutional ownership the most, which would provide empirical evidence to assist organizations that want to engage with specific institutional owners. Additionally, future studies might want to gather additional empirical evidence concerning all dimensions of institutional investors in an attempt to further our current understanding of the effect that various institutional investors have on SDGs and CSR. Future studies might want to test the effect that different moderators have on the relationship between SDG disclosure and institutional investors. For example, company age, board composition, industry sector and number of shares held by ESG-focused investors could moderate this relationship (Chen and Xie, 2022 ; Emma and Jennifer, 2021 ; García-Meca and Pucheta-Martínez, 2018 ; Mishra, 2022 ; Pucheta-Martínez et al., 2019a ; Zulfiqar and Thapa, 2018 ). Furthermore, future studies might want to explore the effects of institutional investors' OC on companies' CSR and SDG transparency through other theoretical lenses, such as stakeholder theory and institutional theory, to further explore the motivations and organizational behaviours which nurture transparency and disclosure of social, ethical and environmental concerns. By establishing the motivations and organizational behaviours which nurture SDG disclosure, future researchers should then explore which institutional investors tend to adhere to societal norms and expectations the most. Finally, future studies might want to focus on investigating the difficulties institutional investors and companies might have in promoting SDGs and CSR-related activities (Shabana and Ravlin, 2016 ). This could be particularly useful, because the present findings support the notion that the lack of guidance on change does hinder the contribution of institutional investors and companies towards SDG practices (Silva, 2021 ).
