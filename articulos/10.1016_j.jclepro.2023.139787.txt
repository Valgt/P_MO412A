                  In 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) replaced the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), providing guidance and direction for the future development of countries around the world. Both MDG and SDG have established multiple indicators to achieve environmental sustainability. However, few studies have compared the changes in the ecological environment during the two periods. Therefore, this study selected the seven major river basins in China as the study area and comprehensively assessed the changes in ecosystem service importance (ESI) within different basins in the MDG and SDG periods based on six ecosystem services, including habitat quality, soil conservation, water yield, carbon storage, grain production, and aesthetic landscape. Specifically, the changes from 2000 to 2015 and 2015 to 2020 were used to represent MDG and SDG periods, respectively. The results showed that the overall ESI of the seven major river basins showed an increasing trend in both periods, and the proportion of extremely important basins reached 20.39% in 2020, mostly distributed in the Yangtze River basin and the Pearl River basin. Except for carbon storage, other ecosystem services were restored in the SDG period. However, COVID-19 and a series of sudden disasters in 2020 have greatly affected grain production and the aesthetic landscape. The fluctuation of habitat quality also indicated that although the ecological environment has a trend of recovery, there was still some degradation compared to 20 years ago. National protection policies and restoration projects have gradually improved the ecological environment of the seven river basins and are striving to reach the SDG standards step by step. However, many problems still need to be solved urgently, such as the reduction of ecological land, the increase in carbon emissions, and the weak resilience to disasters. China has made significant positive progress in MDG, and more efforts are needed to achieve the SDG goals in the future.

Faculty of Geographical Science Beijing Normal University Beijing 100875 China       Handling Editor: Jun Bi In 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) replaced the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), providing guidance and direction for the future development of countries around the world. Both MDG and SDG have established multiple indicators to achieve environmental sustainability. However, few studies have compared the changes in the ecological environment during the two periods. Therefore, this study selected the seven major river basins in China as the study area and comprehensively assessed the changes in ecosystem service importance (ESI) within different basins in the MDG and SDG periods based on six ecosystem services, including habitat quality, soil conservation, water yield, carbon storage, grain production, and aesthetic landscape. Specifically, the changes from 2000 to 2015 and 2015 to 2020 were used to represent MDG and SDG periods, respectively. The results showed that the overall ESI of the seven major river basins showed an increasing trend in both periods, and the proportion of extremely important basins reached 20.39% in 2020, mostly distributed in the Yangtze River basin and the Pearl River basin. Except for carbon storage, other ecosystem services were restored in the SDG period. However, COVID-19 and a series of sudden disasters in 2020 have greatly affected grain production and the aesthetic landscape. The fluctuation of habitat quality also indicated that although the ecological environment has a trend of recovery, there was still some degradation compared to 20 years ago. National protection policies and restoration projects have gradually improved the ecological environment of the seven river basins and are striving to reach the SDG standards step by step. However, many problems still need to be solved urgently, such as the reduction of ecological land, the increase in carbon emissions, and the weak resilience to disasters. China has made significant positive progress in MDG, and more efforts are needed to achieve the SDG goals in the future.

The core of the MDG was poverty eradication (Jacob, 2017 ). After 15 years of efforts, the 2015 Millennium Development Goals Report stated that the MDG had achieved the most successful anti-poverty campaign in history (Campbell, 2017 ). However, the pressure on the world was not limited to poverty, population explosion, unbalanced regional development, climate change, ecological degradation and other problems, which were becoming increasingly serious. It was urgent to issue more comprehensive, systematic and scientific goals to realize the commitments in the United Nations Millennium Declaration (Basheer et al., 2022 ). In 2015, the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit proposed the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs, hereinafter abbreviated as SDG), which contain 17 general goals and 169 specific goals, involving three dimensions of society, environment and economy (UN, 2015 ). SDG is a system applicable to all countries and an important way to achieve sustainable development globally (Bogers et al., 2022 ; de Jong and Vijge, 2021 ) Fig. 1  . The foundation of MDG and SDG was to rebuild and strengthen the ecosystem services, ensuring that they can provide sustainable benefits for future generations (Mulligan et al., 2020 ). However, the MDG focused on development issues such as poverty eradication, education, and health while ignoring the ecological environment, climate change and other fundamental issues affecting sustainable development (Jacob, 2017 ; Jiang, 2016 ). Only the seventh goal of MDG mentioned “Ensure Environmental Sustainability”, which included three subgoals. The SDG goals and targets, however, provided a more comprehensive and detailed direction for restoring and protecting ecosystems and their functions. Examples include SDG6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG13 (Climate Action), and SDG15 (Life on Land) (Yang et al., 2020 ). Although the SDG is very clear, the ecological problems and implementation progress varied from country to country, from region to region, and from basin to basin (Pires et al., 2021 ). Therefore, it is necessary to carry out ecosystem service assessment to understand its past development and current situation to better correct deficiencies and achieve real sustainable development. Ecosystem services are the benefits that human society can obtain from ecosystems, such as grain production, hydrological regulation, and soil conservation (McPhearson et al., 2022 ; Peng et al., 2021 ). In the past few decades, China has experienced rapid economic growth and has become the second largest economy in the world. However, such success has come at a considerable cost, such as habitat degradation and soil erosion (Ouyang et al., 2016 ). To this end, since the 1970s, the Chinese government has continuously introduced several ecological protection and restoration measures and projects, such as the Three-North Shelter Forest Program, with remarkable results (Li et al., 2021a,b ; Liu et al., 2008 ; Mu et al., 2022 ). Ecosystem service assessment also provides an effective and comprehensive means to understand the extent of ecosystem degradation or protection (Bai et al., 2018 ). Currently, there are many methods to assess ecosystem services, such as physical quality, value and emergy (McPhearson et al., 2022 ). Value can directly calculate the monetary value obtained from the ecosystem, which is a convenient and effective method, but it is vulnerable to the economic level and regional development (Wang et al., 2021a,b ). Emergy is obtained by calculating the flow of matter and energy in the ecosystem, but the parameters are more complex (Liu et al., 2021 ). Physical quality can be modelled to obtain a more realistic ecological change process. InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs) is a comprehensive model widely used at present that can quantitatively assess a variety of ecosystem services (Wang et al., 2022a,b ), such as soil conservation, water production, carbon storage and habitat quality (Ouyang et al., 2016 ; Xu et al., 2020 ). However, different ecosystem services are assessed from different perspectives, which may lead to complex results. Therefore, a comprehensive and effective indicator is needed to integrate all services, which is ecosystem service importance (ESI). The ESI can represent not only the overall change in ecosystem services but also an important standard for delineating ecological sources and an important indicator for understanding ecological security (Zhang et al., 2022 ). The evaluation of ESI places more emphasis on the harmonious development of ecology, society and economy, which is very consistent with the concept of sustainable development (Xie et al., 2015 ). Basins are an important ecological space containing humans and nature and are a very complete and complex system. It is the birthplace of human civilization and still carries the survival and reproduction of human society and the natural environment. Therefore, the health of the basin is very important (Wang et al., 2022a,b ). A basin in its normal state can provide a wide variety of service functions, but human activities have had many negative impacts on the basin, making it unable to adequately supply services (Duan et al., 2022 ; Mosaffaie et al., 2021 ). Therefore, to understand the degradation of the ecological environment in basins, it is necessary to carry out the assessment of ecosystem services and ESI. From the above research progress, it was not difficult to find the following problems (Aznarez et al., 2022 ): The proposal of MDG and SDG was an important node to achieve sustainable development, but there was still a lack of analysis on the changes and comparisons of ecosystem services in these two periods (Bai et al., 2018 ). Basin is an important ecosystem, and most of the current studies assessed them from the whole basin or the upstream and midstream, etc. Few studies have carried out more detailed analyses at the tertiary basin scale (Basheer et al., 2022 ). Ecosystem services are diverse and vary in magnitude and spatial distribution. Using a comprehensive index can better understand the overall evolution and development trend of ecosystem services, and it can better identify the extremely important areas and change areas. The above problems existed not only in Chinese basins, but also in other countries and basins, where there was a lack of comparative studies of MDG and SDG at multiple scales. Therefore, the research framework and ideas constructed in this study are also applicable to other basins and regions around the world, and the research results provide important references and bases for future conservation and management. Therefore, this study selected the seven major river basins in China as the study area, and tertiary watersheds were used as the study unit. In order to explore the issue of “How has the importance of ecosystem services in major river basins in China changed during the MDG and SDG periods?”, the following research content was conducted (Aznarez et al., 2022 ): to understand the land use changes in different basins in the MDG and SDG periods (Bai et al., 2018 ); to evaluate the changes in water yield, soil conservation, habitat quality, carbon storage, grain production and aesthetic landscape in each basin in the MDG and SDG periods; and (Basheer et al., 2022 ) to comprehensively analyse the changes in ESI in each basin in the MDG and SDG periods. Finally, the discussion fully explored the mutual support between MDG and SDG and ecosystem services and ESI, as well as the contribution of national ecological policies and engineering to ecological restoration, and put forwards some practical suggestions for each basin based on the research findings.  2 Methodology 2.1 Study area The seven major river basins in China include the Songhua River (SHR), Liaohe River (LHR), Haihe River (HAR), Yellow River (YER), Huaihe River (HUR), Yangtze River (YAR) and Pearl River (PER). This study used the tertiary basin of each basin as the statistical unit (Figs. S1–S7 ). The total area of the study area is more than 5 million km2 , accounting for more than half of all China, and the population accounts for more than 90%. The terrain in the region is complex, including plains, hills and mountains, and the climate is diverse, ranging from the cold temperate zone to the subtropical zone (Wang et al., 2020 ). The SHR is located in north-eastern China and is one of the three major black soil belts in the world. The LHR and HUR have large areas of farmland, which are important grain production bases in China (Su et al., 2015 ). China's three major urban agglomerations are located in the HAR, YAR and PER, which have also become the engines of China's economic development. In recent years, due to the impact of a series of human activities, such as social development and urban expansion, the ecological environment of the seven major river basins has been damaged and degraded (He et al., 2022 ). According to previous studies, there has been varying degrees of reduction in grass, forest, wetland and other ecological types within the basins (Shen et al., 2019 ; Li et al., 2021a,b ; Du et al., 2023 ). During the MDG and SDG periods, China introduced a number of protection and restoration measures to promote the coordination and unification of ecological environment protection and high-quality economic development. Therefore, it is very important to understand the changes in ecosystem services and ESI (Fig. 2  ).  2.2 Data sources This study collected a variety of data, including land use, meteorology, soil, topography and socioeconomics. To correspond to the start and end years of MDG and SDG, the data for 2000, 2015 and 2020 were selected. Therefore, the MDG and SDG periods refer to 2000–2015 and 2015–2020, respectively. Specifically, the land use data were collected from the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research (CAS), including 20 land types (Liu et al., 2014 ) (Table 2 ). Precipitation and evapotranspiration were from NASA's Global Precision Measurement mission (GPM) monthly precipitation dataset and MOD16A3, respectively, and the digital elevation model (DEM) was also from NASA. Temperature data were collected from the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center (Peng et al., 2019 ). Since the MODIS data in 2000 are less than one year, 2001 was used instead. The soil texture, organic matter content and depth data were obtained from CAS and the soil dataset, respectively (Shangguan et al., 2013 ). The grain yield and tourism income were derived from the China Statistical Yearbook. First, the tourism income and grain yield of all cities covered by the seven major river basins were counted, and then the average value was calculated with the river basins as the statistical unit. All data were resampled to 1 km resolution (Table 1   ).  2.3 Ecosystem importance assessment method Under the background of MDG and SDG, this study aimed to evaluate the completion of the two goals from the perspective of ecosystem services and ESI. At present, ecosystem services can be roughly divided into regulation services, supply services, support services and cultural services. In this study, grain production, water yield, carbon storage, soil conservation, habitat quality and aesthetic landscape were selected to characterize different types of service functions, and these functions could directly or indirectly support and reflect the indicators of MDG and SDG. Among them, the more relevant indicators include MDG1 (Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger), MDG7 (Ensure environmental sustainability), SDG2 (Zero hunger), SDG6 (Clean water and sanitation), SDG7 (Affordable and clean energy), SDG11 (Sustainable cities and communities), SDG13 (Climate action), and SDG15 (Life on land). First, various data from three times were collected and performed statistical analysis on land use change. Habitat quality, water yield, soil conservation and carbon storage were calculated using the InVEST model, and grain yield and tourism income were used to characterize grain production and aesthetic landscape, respectively. Then, the changes in ecosystem services and ESI in each basin and their tertiary basin were analysed in detail. Finally, the mutual support between ecosystem services and ESI and the two goals were discussed, as well as the development and contribution of national protection and repair policies. In addition, according to the current situation of ecosystem services and ESI in different basins, corresponding suggestions were given (Fig. 3  ). 2.3.1 Water yield assessment The water yield assessment model of InVEST is based on Budyko's water-heat coupling equilibrium, which is calculated by subtracting the actual evaporation from the precipitation in each grid cell (Sharp et al., 2015 ). Actual evapotranspiration includes vegetation transpiration and surface evapotranspiration, so the water yield is easily affected by precipitation, vegetation type, land use, soil and other factors. The core formula is as follows.(1) Y ( x )  = ( 1 −  A E T  ( x )   P ( x )    ) ∙ P  ( x  )      where Y (x ) represents the annual water yield of each grid cell x  (mm), and AET (x ) and P (x ) are the annual evapotranspiration (mm) and annual precipitation (mm) of each grid cell x , respectively. The parameters required by the model include precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, soil depth, effective water content of plants, land use, basin boundary, and biophysical parameters (Sun et al., 2020 ). The details are provided in the supplementary material.  2.3.2 Soil conservation assessment Soil conservation is one of the important regulation services provided by ecosystems. The principle of the soil conservation module is the revised universal soil loss equation, which is obtained by calculating the difference between the potential soil erosion (RKLS) and the actual soil erosion (USLE). RKLS refers to soil erosion without vegetation cover and soil conservation measures, while USLE refers to soil erosion with vegetation cover and soil conservation measures (Li et al., 2020 ). The formula is as follows.(2) S C  ( x )  = R K L S  ( x )  − U S L E  ( x )      (3) R K L S  ( x )  = R ( x )  ∙ K  ( x )  ∙ L S  ( x )      (4) U S L E  ( x )  = R ( x )  ∙ K  ( x )  ∙ L S  ( x )  ∙ C  ( x )  ∙ P  ( x )      where SC (x ) is the soil conservation of each grid cell x  (t/hm2 ∙a), R (x ), K (x ), LS (x ), C (x ) and P (x ) represent the rainfall erosion factor (MJ∙mm/hm2 ∙h∙a), soil erosion factor (t∙hm2 ∙h/MJ∙hm2 ∙mm), topographic factor, vegetation cover and crop management factor, and soil conservation measure factor, respectively. The details are provided in the supplementary material.  2.3.3 Habitat quality assessment Habitat quality has an important impact on biodiversity. The better the habitat quality is, the higher the ecosystem services. InVEST uses the sensitivity of land type to threat factors and the intensity of threat factors to assess habitat quality, and the different threat factors may exhibit linear decay or exponential decay with distance (Zhang and Lang, 2022 ). The formula is as follows.(5) H Q  x j   = H j  ( 1 −  ( D x j  z  D x j  z  + k z    )   )      where HQ xj   is the habitat quality of grid x  in habitat type j , H j   is the habitat quality score of habitat type j , k  is a half-saturation parameter, generally set as 1/2 of the maximum value of habitat degradation, Z  is an empirical parameter, and D xj   is the habitat degradation degree. The details are provided in the supplementary material.  2.3.4 Carbon storage assessment The process of carbon absorption and accumulation is conducive to regulating the global climate and mitigating the greenhouse effect. In 2020, China proposed the “Double carbon” target, that is, to achieve carbon peak by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. In this context, understanding past changes in carbon storage is of great significance for future national and regional policies. The carbon storage calculated by InVEST includes four parts: aboveground, belowground, soil and dead organic matter (Niu et al., 2022 ). The specific calculation is as follows.(6) C = A × ( D  a b o v e   + D b e l o w   + D s o i l   + D d e a d    )     where C is the total carbon storage (ton ha−1  year−1 ); D above  , D below  , C soil  , and C dead   represent the carbon densities of above-ground, below-ground, soil, and dead organic matter, respectively (Deng et al., 2022 ). The calculation process and carbon density are shown in the supplementary material.  2.3.5 Ecosystem service importance (ESI) assessment The ESI is an important and comprehensive indicator to characterize the importance of ecosystem services and the effectiveness of regional protection. Previous studies have defined this indicator as ecological importance, but this study considered that ecological importance included not only ecosystem services but also vulnerability and other indicators. For this reason, it was more reasonable to define it as the importance of ecosystem services. Therefore, the six ecosystem services were divided into four grades according to the natural breakpoint method: generally important, moderate important, more important and extremely important. Then, the ESI was obtained by the product method (Xie et al., 2015 ).(7) E S I  = ∏ i = 1   n  E i   n      where ESI  represents the comprehensive index of ecosystem service importance and S i   represents the importance level of ecosystem service i .    3 Result 3.1 Analysis of land use change in seven river basins The land use types of the seven major river basins were dominated by farmland, forest and grass, but they declined to different degrees in the MDG and SDG periods and more in the SDG than in the MDG, with declines of 2.77%, 0.50% and 2.23%, respectively, from 2000 to 2020. In addition, the area of water and construction land increased during both the MDG and SDG periods, with water increasing by 4.28% and 10.89%, respectively, while the construction land increased by 24.11% and 22.14%, respectively. The wetland area decreased in the MDG but increased in the SDG, with an overall increase of 8.15%. In the secondary category of land types, although the area of forest and grass decreased, the area of woodland and low-coverage grass increased by 2.33% and 28.80%, respectively. There was a significant increase in rivers, reservoirs, ponds, and swamps in the natural environment, while the areas of urban, rural and other construction land in the human environment also rose significantly and increased more rapidly in the SDG period. The map spatial information showed that farmland was mainly distributed in the SHR, LHR, HAR and HUR, and paddy fields were mainly located in the HUR, YAR and PER. Forest mostly grew in the Greater Khingan Mountains of the SHR, Changbai Mountains of the SHR and LHR, Qinling Mountains of the YER, Hengduan Mountains of the YAR and Nanling Mountains of the PER. Grass was mostly located in the western part of the SHR and YAR and the whole area of the YER. Among the secondary categories of water, there were more lakes in the SHR and YAR, more rivers in the LHR and YER, and more reservoirs and ponds in the rest of the basins. Wetlands were mostly distributed in the SHR, upstream of the YER and upstream and downstream of the YAR. Construction land has obviously expanded in both MDG and SDG periods and was basically around farmland (Fig. 4  ). In different basins, the land types in the SHR were mainly dry land, woodland and high-coverage grass, accounting for 23.60%, 38.74% and 10.12% in 2020, respectively. In addition to construction land, paddy fields and other woodlands grew significantly in the MDG period. River, reservoir and ponds, swamp increased significantly in the SDG period, mainly located near Heilongjiang River, Nierji, Jiangqiao (SHR-1/3/4). The area of forest and floodplain has reduced more, mainly concentrated in Heilongjiang River, Harbin, Tonghe (SHR-1/11). The main land types of LHR were consistent with those of the SHR, and the dry land area was approximately one-third of the total area. Except for tidal flat and construction land, the area change of other land types was not significant during the MDG period. During the SDG period, woodland, water and construction land increased by more than 10%, especially in rivers, urban areas, reservoirs and ponds. Special attention should be given to tidal flats, which are reduced by 20.00% and 20.12% in the MDG and SDG periods, respectively, and are mostly concentrated in the Liuhe River, Taizi River and Daliao River (LHR-7/10). The area of farmland in the HAR was nearly 50%, but paddy fields were rapidly decreasing. Different from other basins, the areas of farmland, forest and grass decreased significantly in both periods. The reduction in farmland was mainly concentrated in the eastern plains. In addition to construction land, the area of water and wetlands in the HAR increased significantly during the SDG period, and the growth of lakes and tidal flats even more than doubled, mostly distributed in coastal basins. The situation of HUR and HAR was similar. The proportion of farmland area was more than 60%, and the paddy field area still increased during the SDG period. However, the overall area of grass and forest decreased, and the change areas were mainly concentrated in Wangbeng and Wangjiaba (HUR-8/13/14/15). In addition, the land types with obvious growth include rivers, tidal flats, reservoirs and ponds, which are distributed in the Xiaoqing River, Jiaodong Peninsula (HUR-1/2). Except for construction land, the land type change in the YER was not significant. During the MDG and SDG periods, the farmland area was reduced and transformed into forest and grass. The growth of water was also obvious, especially in rivers, reservoirs and ponds. Marsh increased by 10.64% during the SDG period, but floodplain decreased by 10.2%. These changes were mainly concentrated in the river source, Datong River and Shizuishan (YER-6/10/24). The main land types of the YAR and PER were forest, with the area accounting for 41.28% and 59.7% in 2020, respectively. The forest of the YAR decreased in the MDG and increased in the SDG. But the PER was different, the forest in this basin continued to decrease, mainly located in the basins of the Beipan River, Nanpan River and Youjiang River (PER-1/6/11). The area of grass and farmland in the YAR was more than 20% but decreased slightly. In addition, the change in tidal flat area was also relatively obvious, increasing by 79.98% in the MDG but decreasing by 33.34% in the SDG, and the change places were concentrated in Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake (YER-27/28). The areas of river, lake, marsh, reservoir and pond in PER were slightly restored in the SDG, with more significant recovery in the West and North River Delta, Bailian of Hanjiang River and the rivers in eastern Guangdong (PER-10/18) (Fig. 5  ).  3.2 Analysis of the change in ecosystem services in seven river basins The overall habitat quality of the seven major river basins did not change much, showing a process of first decreasing and then increasing. The habitat quality of SHR and PER was higher, followed by the YAR, LHR, YER, HAR and HUR. During the MDG and SDG periods, HAR, HUR and PER all decreased, while the SHR, LHR and YAR first decreased and then increased, and only the YER increased all the time. At the importance level, the extremely important basins were mainly distributed in the Heilongjiang River, Erguna River, Nierji, and Tumen River in SHR (SHR-1/2/3/17); Qingjiang River, Xiuhe River and Ganjiang River in YAR (YAR-25/32/41/44); and Guihejiang River in PER (PER-5). Most of the basins with high soil conservation were located in the YAR and PER, where the extremely important areas were the Yalong River, Dadu River, Qingyi River and Shigu in the YAR (YAR-3/6/9/10/34). From 2000 to 2020, the soil conservation function of the seven basins first decreased and then increased and increased by more than 50% in the SDG period. The functional values of YAR and PER were much higher than those of other basins, and both showed an increasing trend. The water yield function showed a gradual upwards trend from northwest to southeast in space and increased significantly in the MDG and SDG periods, increasing by 27.44% and 64.60%, respectively. The water yield function was weakest in the YER and strongest in the PER. The extremely important basins were mainly located in the middle and southeast of the YAR and PER. The overall carbon storage function of the seven major river basins gradually decreased, with decreases of 0.31% and 0.09% in the MDG and SDG periods, respectively, and the rate of decline slowed slightly. The functions of YAR and PER were higher, and extremely important basins were basically distributed in these two areas. The SHR, HUR and YAR increased slightly over the study period, while other regions decreased. The overall grain production significantly increased in the MDG and remained stable in the SDG. The SHR, HUR and YAR decreased slightly within the SDG period, while other basins continued to increase over both time periods. The extremely important areas for grain production were distributed in various basins, such as Fengman in SHR (SHR-16/18), Dongliao River in LHR (LHR-2), Tuhaimajia River in HAR (HAR-12), Shizuishan in YER (YER-1/2/6) and Lixia River in HUR (HUR-9). The aesthetic landscape in the MDG and SDG periods increased by 1633.78% and 4.23%, respectively, and the functional values of HAR, YAR and PER were higher. However, due to the impact of COVID-19, the aesthetic landscape of SHR, LHR and HAR has been significantly reduced. The extremely important basins were mainly located around the first-tier cities in China. These areas have higher tourism revenue, but they are also more vulnerable to the impact of external factors such as the epidemic (Fig. 6  ). The range and extent of changes in the six ecosystem service functions within the SDG were more intense than those in the MDG. Here, the changes in each basin during the two time periods were counted. In both periods, there were more basins with decreasing habitat quality than increasing ones. Most of the reduction areas of MDG were in the YAR and PER, with Wuyang District and Huangpu River district in YAR (YAR-13/18) and Dongjiang River Delta and West and North River Delta in PER (PER-17/18) being the most serious. The areas of improved habitat quality in the SDG increased significantly and were mostly concentrated in the Hunjiang River and coastal areas in LHR (LHR-6/9/11/12) and the Qujiang River and Sinan in YAR (YAR-17/30). The decreasing areas were most serious in Zhimenda to Shigu of YAR (YAR-9) and Youjiang River of PER (PER-11). The decreased area of the soil conservation function was greater than the increased area in the MDG period. In the SDG period, the recovery area increased significantly and was more distributed in the YAR, but there was a significant decrease near the Beijiang River and Dongjiang River in the PER (PER-7/8/9). In both periods, the increased basins of water yield were far more than the decreased basins, and the areas with obvious increases were concentrated in the YAR and PER, but there were also some significant reduction areas in these two basins, such as the upstream of the YAR and the coastal areas of the PER. The variation in the carbon storage level in the SDG was more drastic than that in the MDG. Most of the reduction areas in MDG were distributed in the coastal areas of PER, but in the SDG, they were spread over the whole PER. The carbon storage of some tertiary basins in the YAR increased significantly in both periods, while some basins decreased slightly in the SDG period. Grain production showed a significant increase in the MDG period, especially in the SHR and LHR, but there was a significant decrease in the PER in the West and North River Delta and Beijiang River (PER-7/9/18). In the SDG period, there were some basins with obvious reductions in SHJ and the middle and lower reaches of YAR, especially in the Qingjiang River, Danjiangkou and Wuhan of YAR (YAR-15/19/21/25). The aesthetic landscape of different basins showed an upwards trend during the MDG period, and the regions with larger increases were mainly close to Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chongqing and other first-tier cities. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 caused a greater impact on the tourism industry, and the basins around the first-tier cities were first affected. SHR and LHR were also greatly affected (Fig. 7  ).  3.3 Analysis of the change in ESI in seven river basins Grain production and aesthetic landscapes were more vulnerable to human activities, especially the emergence of COVID-19 in 2020, which has had a greater impact on agriculture and tourism. Therefore, to better understand the changes in ESI, two scenarios were set up here. One scenario calculated the ESI to include grain production and aesthetic landscape (ESI-A). The other scenario removed these two ecosystem services to better understand the current state of natural ecosystem service importance (ESI-B). Both analytical methods were used in this study. The average ESI for the seven major river basins as a whole increased regardless of the time period and scenario, and the number of basins with increased levels was always greater than that with decreased levels. In terms of spatial distribution, the importance levels of the basins were lower in the north and higher in the south. Most of the extremely important regions were distributed in the YAR and PER, such as the Xinjiang River, Fuhe River, and Lishui River in the YAR (YAR-29/33/37) and the Guihejiang River, Qianxun River and Xijiang River in PER (PER-5/12). Important basins were mostly distributed in the YER and LHR. In ESI-A, the proportions of basins in 2020 from generally important to extremely important were 31.58%, 28.29%, 19.74% and 20.39%, respectively. Important and moderately important basins declined in both MDG and SDG periods, more important basins increased among SDG, and extremely important regions increased in both time periods. The level change of YAR was most obvious. For example, the Yalong River, Fujiang River, Qingyi River and Minjiang River main streams declined in MDG but recovered in SDG (YAR-3/10/14). The coastal basins of PER decreased in both MDG and SDG periods, both from extremely important to more important, and the LHR had no basins with level restoration in the two periods. In ESI-B, the overall importance levels of the seven major river basins were higher than that of ESI-A, and moderately important became the main level in 2020. In the same year, the number of extremely important basins far exceeded that of more important basins, accounting for 24.34%. All these results showed that the overall ecological status of the study area showed a recovery trend in the past 20 years when the influence of more human activities and external factors was excluded. In ESI-B, the importance levels changes in the MDG were much less than those in ESI-A, which indicated that the changes in grain yield and aesthetic landscape profoundly affected the ESI of each basin. However, the basins where the importance levels declined under this scenario required more attention, as these changes were closely related to the natural environment. In addition, in the SDG period, the basins with rising importance levels in ESI-B occupied a larger proportion, not only in the YAR but also in some areas of the LHR, SHR and HUR (Fig. 8  ). Here, the importance averages of all basins were calculated separately for two periods and two scenarios. The importance levels of LHR, HAR, HUR and YER in ESI-A were higher than those in ESI-B, indicating that the grain yield and aesthetic landscape in these basins were very important. The results of SHR, YAR and PER were opposite, indicating that the ecosystem services of the natural environment in these regions were better. In the MDG period, the importance of HAR decreased in ESI-B and increased in ESI-A, indicating that the ecological environment of HAR was damaged. However, in the SDG period, the importance of SHR and LHR decreased in ESI-A and increased in ESI-B, indicating a slight decrease in grain yield and aesthetic landscape during this period. The importance levels of PER decreased in both scenarios, indicating that the whole system in the basin was deteriorating. However, the level of ESI-B was higher than that of ESI-A, which indicated that natural functions still played a dominant role in the region (Fig. 9  ).   4 Discussion 4.1 Mutual support of ecosystem service functions with MDG/SDG In fact, people gradually realized the growing urgency of sustainable development worldwide, which led to the creation of MDG and SDG. These two goals have clarified the existing problems in the current economy, society and ecology. Only by solving these problems can we achieve sustainable development (Wijayanti et al., 2016 ). At present, ecological and environmental issues are a priority on the agenda of many national governments. Only by understanding the current problems of ecosystems can we better achieve the goals (Castelló et al., 2010 ). The ESI assessment of this study integrated six ecosystem services, including habitat quality, soil conservation, water yield, carbon storage, grain production and aesthetic landscape, which could correspond to the goals and indicators of MDG and SDG, respectively. The development idea of MDG was to eliminate global extreme poverty, which focused more attention on social problems such as poverty, hunger and disease in developing countries (de Jong and Vijge, 2021 ). China is the largest developing country in the world, and grain production and food security are very important (Pan et al., 2020 ). Previous research showed that China has achieved a continuous increase in grain production from 2003 to 2015 through active agricultural policies and advanced agricultural technologies (Wang et al., 2018 ). Similarly, the results of this study showed that grain production in each basin has increased by different magnitudes. In 2015, the report "China's implementation of the Millennium Development Goals” pointed out that the MDG1 goal had been achieved (Ministry of Foreign Affairs People's Republic of China, 2015 ). However, in 2021, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations released the report “The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World”, stating that the global food security situation was critical due to the impact of COVID-19, international conflicts, extreme climate and pests and diseases (FAO et al., 2021 ). In China, the grain production of SHR, HUR and YAR was indeed slightly affected. Compared to MDG1, in SDG2, in addition to eliminating hunger, it is more important to achieve food security and develop sustainable agriculture, which needs to be further strengthened in the future. MDG7 was to ensure environmental sustainability and contained four specific goals, namely, reversing resource loss, reducing biodiversity loss, obtaining safe drinking water and infrastructure, and improving living conditions. According to the report "China's implementation of the Millennium Development Goals”, there was still much work to be done to achieve the goals, especially the goal of reducing biodiversity loss, which had not been achieved at all (Ministry of Foreign Affairs People's Republic of China, 2015 ). The problem of biodiversity loss was imminent not only in China but also globally. Therefore, the specific goals of SDG15 were to curb biodiversity loss and integrate ecosystem and biodiversity conservation into national and regional planning. Habitat quality was critical in supporting biodiversity (Aznarez et al., 2022 ), and the results of this study also showed that habitat quality in most basins showed a downwards trend in the MDG but a slight recovery in the SDG, indicating that although habitat quality restoration and biodiversity conservation have been effective, there was still much work to be done (Hu et al., 2021 ). Second, water resources are also a matter of importance. The success of almost all goals depends fundamentally on water (Mulligan et al., 2020 ). While MDG1 only mentioned the problem of drinking water, SDG6 expanded it to many aspects, such as improving water quality, restoring water-related ecosystems, and integrated management of water resources. In this study, the water assessment was carried out from soil conservation and water yield, and the results showed that the water yield function was continuously increasing, and soil conservation also increased significantly in the SDG period. These assessment results, especially at the basin scale, indicated that there was great progress and effectiveness in the conservation and management of water resources in China. After the industrial revolution, a large number of greenhouse gases were emitted, which caused a series of severe climate and environmental problems, making the world in great danger. In this context, China has introduced many emission reduction measures and promised to achieve carbon peaking by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060 (Wang et al., 2021a,b ; Wei et al., 2022 ). In this paper, the assessment results of carbon storage showed a continuous decreasing trend, so the carbon emissions were undoubtedly increasing. SDG7 and SDG13 focus on sustainable energy and climate change, respectively, which are both inextricably linked to carbon storage and carbon emissions. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen social management and public science to achieve these goals in the future. The reason why tourism income was chosen to represent the aesthetic landscape was to understand the well-being and intangible benefits that people could obtain from the ecological environment. It can directly characterize the connection between human and natural systems. From the analysis results, with the growth of the social economy, people began to focus more on entertainment and aesthetic experience. In the MDG period, the aesthetic landscape of all basins showed an obvious increasing trend. However, due to the impact of COVID-19, tourism in many basins was affected in 2020, especially in more developed areas. Therefore, to achieve the goal of sustainable development, SDG1, SDG3 and SDG11 all pointed out the need to have disaster management and early warning capabilities and to have adequate response measures in the face of unexpected disasters and epidemics to avoid more losses.  4.2 Impact of protection policies on basin ecology In the 1970s, the proposal of reform and opening-up led to unprecedented economic development everywhere in China, but this also led to very serious ecological degradation and environmental pollution, resulting in some unprecedented natural disasters (Zhou and Liu, 2021 ). To change this situation, China has started to introduce ecological protection policies and restoration projects, and various ecological environment protection legislation has been issued continuously (Xie., 2020 ). In addition, China has successively carried out many projects, such as natural forest resources protection, returning farmland to forest, returning farmland to grassland, etc., all of which have produced great ecological and social impacts (Liu et al., 2008 ). In 2000, the National Ecological Environment Protection Program was issued, which provided a general idea for future ecological protection work in China. The goals of the program fit well with the MDG and SDG, such as curbing ecological deterioration and strengthening natural resource management. Since then, China has started to carry out several plans for important regions to delay the decline of biodiversity and key ecosystem services, such as key ecological function reserves and main function areas, as well as natural reserves and national parks (Xu et al., 2017 ). In 2015, the “Ecological Red Line” was incorporated into the Environmental Protection Law to compulsorily and strictly protect the abovementioned important areas (Jiang et al., 2018 ). At present, China's ecological protection work has entered the stage of ecological civilization. The proposition of a series of important ideas, such as Beautiful China and Clear waters and green mountains being as good as mountains of gold and silver, has placed more emphasis on the harmonious coexistence and sustainable development of humans and nature (Hou et al., 2021 ). The South-to-North Water Diversion and the Three Gorges Dam are very important water conservancy projects in China. The Three Gorges Dam, located in the YAR, was fully put into use in 2006. It played an important role in water resource regulation, flood control and power generation in the basin (Yang et al., 2022 ). The South-to-North Water Diversion is the largest interbasin water transfer project in the world, which can transfer water resources within the YAR to HAR, HUR and other basins (Rogers et al., 2020 ). It can alleviate the problem of water shortages in the north, improve the ecological environment and indirectly promote economic development (Zhao et al., 2021 ; Office of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project Construction Committee, State Council, PRC, 2016 ). After 2013, comprehensive planning documents were issued for each basin, which could provide an important basis for the development, utilization, management and protection of the basin. The YAR and YER are the first and second largest rivers in China and play an important role in ecological protection work in China. The Yangtze River Protection Law and the Yellow River Protection Law were promulgated in 2020 and 2021, respectively, and played an important role in maintaining China's ecological security and promoting high-quality regional development (Sheng et al., 2022 ). At the same time, the introduction of these two laws shows that river basin management is gradually systematized and legalized, which will be of great significance for the sustainable development and ecosystem service importance enhancement of basins in the future (Fig. 10  ).  4.3 Current issues and policy recommendations for different basins From the results of this study, it could be found that the problems vary from one basin to another. For this reason, recommendations and measures according to the current situation of land use, ecosystem services and ESI in each basin were listed below.(1) In recent years, the areas of forest and grass in the SHR, LHR and HUR have decreased, and many floodplains and tidal flats have also been damaged. Affected by land use, climate change and other reasons, habitat quality and carbon storage decreased to varying degrees during the study period. In addition, the reduction in dry land area and the occurrence of epidemics and disasters in 2020 have affected grain production and tourism in the basin. Therefore, the future management of these three basins should focus on the restoration and protection of forests, grasslands and wetlands to enhance ecosystem services. Additionally, emergency measures and management plans should be in place to deal with unexpected disasters to reduce losses.  (2) During the study period, forest and water in the HAR and YAR increased, especially the increase in woodland in the SDG period. However, the decrease in grass made the habitat quality within the region only maintain a steady state. HAR and YAR are the core basins of the South-to-North Water Diversion and Three Gorges Dam. They have brought a lot of positive benefits, however, the environmental problems caused by the projects have been constantly emerging, such as the fragility of lake stability, degradation or even disappearance of wetlands, deterioration of water quality, and reduction of biodiversity (Yan et al., 2023 ; Li et al., 2023 ). Therefore, it is still necessary to pay attention to the protection of the ecological environment in these two basins, and the degradation and destruction of ecological land should be curbed in time to ensure the stability of the ecological environment. In addition, there are many important domestic cities in the HAR and YAR, so carbon storage and carbon emission issues need to be continuously considered. In particular, the carbon storage of HAR continues to decline in the MDG and SDG periods. How to speed up the promotion of green and low-carbon development also needs to step up the introduction of emission reduction measures.  (3) The YER is affected by natural, social, historical and other factors, and the ecological environment is very fragile. Although the ESI of YER was the smallest, the effectiveness of conservation has been very remarkable in recent years, and the areas of forest, grass, wetland and water have been significantly restored. From the research results, the biggest problem at present is the continuous decline in carbon storage. Therefore, it is very important to develop scientific methods and measures to improve carbon storage according to the actual situation of different tertiary basins.  (4) The PER had the largest ESI but was the basin with the worst decline. The region is rich in ecological resources, but due to the influence of human activities, forest, grass and wetland have been damaged, and the habitat quality and carbon storage have also continued to decline. Compared with other regions, more attention should be given to the restoration of ecological land so that it can provide more complete ecosystem services and values.     4.4 Limitations In this study, the analysis and assessment of land use, ecosystem services, and ESI of the seven major river basins in China were carried out separately, with the aim of understanding the changes and trends of the above elements in the MDG and SDG periods. However, there were a few limitations in the content. First, China is a very large country, and although this study was thorough enough in the study of ecosystem services, it can continue to be improved, such as adding more support and cultural services. Second, this study used the InVEST model to carry out the assessment, and the aesthetic landscape used the tourism output value instead. There may be some uncertainties in these methods and data, which may affect the final results. Third, this study lacked some discussion on the driving factors. Since only the results of 2000, 2015 and 2020 were evaluated, the driver analysis may be unreasonable. Therefore, the evaluation years can be added in the future to conduct more scientific research. Finally, since SDG has only carried out the first phase thus far, this study can be continued as time goes by.   5 Conclusion The environment is an important foundation for the realization of sustainable development. Based on this starting point, this study explored the changes in land use, ecosystem services and ecosystem service importance (ESI) in the seven major river basins by combining MDG and SDG. The results showed that (Aznarez et al., 2022 ) the range and extent of land use change in the SDG were greater than those in the MDG period. The areas of forest, grass and farmland in most basins decreased, while the areas of water and construction land increased (Bai et al., 2018 ). Affected by ecological land change, habitat quality and carbon storage decreased slightly, while soil conservation and water yield increased significantly. In 2020, the occurrence of COVID-19 and natural disasters greatly affected grain production and the aesthetic landscape, but the overall upwards trend was still obvious (Basheer et al., 2022 ). ESI increased during both periods, and the extremely important areas were mainly distributed in YAR and PER. The increase of ESI was more obvious under the natural ecosystem services combination. Although China has issued many protection measures and restoration projects, the future ecological management of the seven major river basins is still very serious. First, it is necessary to curb the degradation of ecological land, which is the key to enhancing ecosystem services. Second, the decline in carbon storage requires more attention and improvement plans should be issued based on the actual problems of each basin. Finally, China has made great progress in MDG and made significant contributions to many goals, while the SDG has entered a new implementation stage. The results of this study provide a reference for the future development and improvement of the SDG.
