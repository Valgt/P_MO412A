                  The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations in 2015 cover the three economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, as well as an additional institutional dimension related to governance. The monitoring framework of the SDGs is composed of 231 indicators. Our objective is to measure interlinkages between these indicators using the UN Global SDG Database, based on the premise that the United Nations from the outset considered that taking into account these interlinkages and the integrated nature of the SDGs would be a prerequisite for achieving these goals. The Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) used to measure the correlation between indicators shows that SDGs related to human development alone contribute to 30 % of the observed variance of all the indicators at the world level, and that country performances in this field are strongly correlated to their income level. These results suggest that successful development policies contribute both to improving the national productive capacity and the different dimensions of human development. We mostly observe synergies (positive correlations) rather than trade-offs (negative correlations) between indicators. The Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) distinguishes three groups of countries according to their performance in terms of SDG indicators. Consistent with our MFA results, we find that the differentiation between countries, and hence the composition of these groups, mainly reflects their economic development as measured by their GNI/capita.

(1) Indicators which should decrease according to SDG targets have been reverse coded, so progress towards sustainable development is always measured through indicators increasing in our analysis. These indicators are marked with an aterisk. (2) The indicators closest to the circle are the indicators best represented on the plane. Only 25 indicators that contribute the most to the construction of the plane feature on this figure. 3  Although GNI/capita is not in the list of indicators used for the MFA, it has been included as an illustrative variable.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations in 2015 cover the three economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, as well as an additional institutional dimension related to governance. The monitoring framework of the SDGs is composed of 231 indicators. Our objective is to measure interlinkages between these indicators using the UN Global SDG Database, based on the premise that the United Nations from the outset considered that taking into account these interlinkages and the integrated nature of the SDGs would be a prerequisite for achieving these goals. The Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) used to measure the correlation between indicators shows that SDGs related to human development alone contribute to 30 % of the observed variance of all the indicators at the world level, and that country performances in this field are strongly correlated to their income level. These results suggest that successful development policies contribute both to improving the national productive capacity and the different dimensions of human development. We mostly observe synergies (positive correlations) rather than trade-offs (negative correlations) between indicators. The Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) distinguishes three groups of countries according to their performance in terms of SDG indicators. Consistent with our MFA results, we find that the differentiation between countries, and hence the composition of these groups, mainly reflects their economic development as measured by their GNI/capita.   Keywords Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  Human development  SDG Indicators  Interlinkages  Multiple Factor Analysis  Hierarchical Cluster Analysis    1 Introduction The 2030 Agenda adopted in 2015 by the United Nations contains 17 goals and 169 targets. It brings together two previous agendas: that of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and that of the World Summits on Sustainable Development.1 Summits between world leaders have been held by the UN every ten years since 1992 with the aim of defining the means of stimulating sustainable development at a global level. The last World Summit, known as “Rio+20”, took place in Rio de Janeiro in 2012, 20 years after the Rio de Janeiro 1992 World Summit.  1   The MDGs, adopted in 2000, only covered developing countries. They focused essentially on poverty and human development, defined by UNDP (1997)  – inspired by Ul Haq and Sen – as the process of enlarging people's choices, knowing that “the three essential choices for people are to lead a long and healthy life, to acquire knowledge and to have access to the resources needed for a decent standard of living” . The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are universal and based on a holistic conception of development: they especially expand their scope to the environmental aspect of sustainable development, as well as to the rule of law and the quality of institutions. The SDGs were prepared in a participatory process led by the UN that lasted several years. It is therefore not a coherent, centrally defined framework, but is the result of a consensus that required accepting a stacking of goals and targets. For example, SDG16 (“Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions”) was added in extremis  just before the adoption of the SDGs, when several major developing countries (China, India, etc.), which had refused its inclusion throughout the negotiations, eventually gave in (Cling, Razafindrakoto & Roubaud, 2018 ). Despite this deeply empirical approach, the SDGs reflect an extension of the “beyond GDP” measure of economic and social progress that was already being used for the MDGs and that has continued to be employed by the UNDP in its Human Development Report for several decades (UNDP, 2020 ). The SDGs are also consistent with the dashboard approach promoted by Stiglitz, Sen, and Fitoussi (2009)  and by Stiglitz, Fitoussi, and Durand (2018) , which they however enlarge significantly. The 2030 Agenda led to the development of a set of 231 monitoring indicators known as the Sustainable Development Goal Indicators.2 We refer here to the list revised by the United Nations Statistical Commission in March 2021. In fact, the number of indicators is much higher if one takes into account sub-indices and disaggregation between different categories of population (gender, age, urban/rural residence, etc.).  2   It is striking that no per capita income indicator (GNI/capita or GDP/capita) is included among the several hundred SDG indicators.3 However, the annual GDP/capita growth rate is included as an indicator for Target 8.1 “Sustain per capita economic growth in accordance with national circumstances and in particular, at least 7 per cent gross domestic product growth per annum in the least developed countries”. This precise growth target is restricted to the 46 least developed countries.  3   There are at least two reasons for this: first, while per capita income has been considered the main indicator of a country's level of development since the middle of the last century, and while it is related to well-being and human development, it is widely accepted that this indicator is more of a means to an end rather than an end in itself (Kanbur, Patel, & Stiglitz, 2018 ). Furthermore, and this is partly related to the previous point, the SDGs do not assign any target related to a level of GNI or GDP/capita (the equivalent of the MDG's target of “halving poverty”) to be reached by 2030, which would require including a national income indicator. In any case, and as we will argue in this paper, it is paradoxical in a way that the objective of going “beyond GDP” ultimately leads in practice to the quasi-abandonment by the SDGs of this indicator, despite it remaining a powerful indicator correlated to many dimensions of development. The SDG Indicators now constitute a reference for monitoring national policies. However, out of 231 indicators, only a slight majority of them are considered by the UN Statistical Commission to be widely available worldwide at the time of writing, meaning that many SDG Indicators are still very insufficiently measured. Apart from the measurement issues, the large number of indicators is also a challenge for the monitoring of the SDGs, hence our objective to go beyond partial indicator-by-indicator analyses so as not to forget the big picture. Detailed progress analyses have been conducted at the world level by the UN (2020a)  and by its Sustainable Development Solutions Network (Sachs, Schmidt-Traub, Kroll, Lafortune, & Fuller, 2020 ), by UN Regional Commissions for their constituencies (ECLAC, 2019; ESCAP, 2020; ESCWA, 2021; UNECA, 2020; UNECE, 2020 ) and by the OECD (2019) .  However, it is clear to the authors of this paper that this silo approach is insufficient. When adopting the 2030 Agenda, the UN underlined that ”the interlinkages and integrated nature of the Sustainable Development Goals are of crucial importance in ensuring that the purpose of the new Agenda is realized”  (United Nations, 2015 ). Indeed, policies aimed towards achieving one objective might have some positive or negative impact on certain other objectives. In the end, defining policies to implement SDGs requires understanding synergies and trade-offs between them. In the light of this, a first question  raised by this paper concerns the extent and the nature of interlinkages, defined as they are as correlations between objectives, targets and indicators. In practice, our analysis mostly refers to objectives and indicators, which is also the case of most previous studies for practical reasons.4 It would be quite complex to conduct an analysis combining the three dimensions (SDGs, targets and indicators), as several indicators are defined for each target, and several targets are defined for each SDG. Mainali et al. (2018)  analyze the interlinkages between targets, but retain only one indicator for each target. As a consequence, their analysis could instead be considered as focusing on indicators only.  4   There is a growing number of quantitative studies on this subject (Bali Swain & Ranganathan, 2021; Mainali et al., 2018; Miola et al, 2019; Spaiser et al., 2016 ; for a survey, see United Nations, 2019; United Nations, 2020b ), focusing mainly on network analysis conducted generally on time series for a given country grouping. Owing to the lack of data in the UN Global SDG Database, these studies resort to using various alternative data sources (World Bank development indicators, data from NGOs, think tanks, etc.) rather than the UN Database (with the exception of Bali Swain and Ranganathan, ibidem), which is the official source for SDG Indicators. They also generally refer to developed (OECD) countries, or to specific country groupings. According to the results of these studies, synergies are manifestly stronger than trade-offs, the one notable exception being the mooted trade-off between growth and the environment (Bali Swain and Ranganathan, ibidem; Spaiser et al., ibidem; ODI, 2017 ). This finding is important for policy-makers as it should encourage them to focus on these synergies, without worrying too much about any trade-offs. A second question  concerns the analysis of interlinkages: can we conduct it at the global level, or should we limit ourselves to regional or country analyses? According to Bali Swain and Ranganathan (ibidem), “… different regions of the world or groups of countries have different regional settings and benchmarking the SDGs makes sense only within the context of each region and not at the world level” . In the same sense, Kanbur, Patel and Stiglitz (ibidem) consider that the ranking of the major priorities might vary in different parts of the world. However, the rationale of the SDGs is that they are universal, hence the expectation that they should not concern a group of countries only, even if some SDGs (as well as specific targets and indicators) are less relevant in some countries than in others. Whatever the case, the answer to this second question is especially important. If the interlinkages between the SDGs and the indicators are relatively robust at the global level, then development policies implemented within the framework of the 2030 Agenda to achieve the SDGs (the precise components of which can obviously vary from one country to another), will have comparable effects in different countries. If not, that is, if the interlinkages are country specific or specific to each group of countries, the relative importance and impact of policies towards each SDG will be largely different from one country to another. To answer these questions empirically, our paper adopts a quantitative approach using standard data analysis techniques, which offers the advantage of employing a systematic and rigorous well-proven methodology. As we conduct our study at the world level, we were bound to use data from the UN Global SDG Database, which contains official data for SDG Indicators for all UN member countries. However, because this database suffers from a good deal of missing data (as mentioned above), we have to carry out a cross-section rather than a time-series analysis. It follows that the results of such an analysis require careful interpretation, since we measure the correlations between countries and indicators in a given year, and not those between the evolutions of indicators over time. We carry out a broad analysis at the world level as well as that of specific country groupings, to check if the results are comparable. This paper is the first to conduct an analysis of interlinkages based on the UN Global SDG Database at the world level. We conduct a Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA), which is a recognized data analysis technique, and which is the best adapted to analyze these kinds of datasets. This method provides a quantitative measure of correlations between indicators and a clear visualization of these correlations. It also compares the situation of countries for their contribution to the variance and their position along the axes that are a linear combination of indicators. In order to complement the MFA, we conduct a Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) on the SDG Indicators, which measures the distance between countries for these indicators and breaks down the world into three country groupings. Our analysis brings four key-results: (1) It concurs with previous studies on the predominant importance of positive interlinkages compared to trade-offs. (2) It underlines the relevance of conducting an analysis at the world level for these indicators, without neglecting the huge differences of context between countries worldwide. (3) According to our analysis, human development (covered mostly by SDGs 1–4) is the main factor differentiating countries at the world level (as it is to a lesser extent for every group of countries considered, regardless of their development level). (4) Overall, the differences between countries for SDG Indicators derive primarily from their level of economic development as measured by their GNI/capita, as already observed by Cling et al. (2020)  for the EU Sustainable Development Indicators. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2  presents the data used for our study. Section 3  presents the methodology used. Section 4  presents the main results of the MFA applied to SDG Indicators on the whole data set. It also details the country groupings deriving from the results of the HCA applied to the same set of indicators for all countries in our selection, as well as the results of the MFA applied for each country grouping Section 5  concludes.  2 Data 2.1 A list of 231 SDG indicators broken down according to their availability The monitoring of the 2030 Agenda required the creation of a list of indicators. The United Nations tasked a group of experts (IAEG-SDGs), composed of representatives of 27 national statistical institutes, with defining those indicators. The list of indicators was adopted in March 2017 by the United Nations Statistical Commission, and in July 2017 by the UN General Assembly (UN, 2017 ). Since the 2020 revision, the list consists of 231 indicators (excluding double counting) for which a common methodology has been adopted and metadata is available (247 indicators overall). The indicators have been broken down into two categories:• Tier I: Indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, and data are regularly produced by countries for at least 50 per cent of countries and of the population in every region5 The UNSD groups all the countries of the world in 4 regions: Africa; Asia-Pacific; Europe and North America (excl. Mexico); Latin America.  5   where the indicator is relevant;  • Tier II: Indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, but data are not regularly produced by countries.    We used the Tier classification of March 29, 2021, which divided the 231 indicators in 130 Tier I indicators, 97 Tier II indicators and 4 indicators that have multiple tiers. The term “multiple tiers” means that different components of the indicator are classified into different tiers, knowing that at least one component is classified in Tier I. Most of these indicators come from official statistics transmitted by each country. A certain number of indicators are established by the custodian agencies on the basis of international models (in particular to compensate for missing data and improve the comparability of data), or derived from international surveys (e.g. the Doing Business  survey of the World Bank). Finally, some indicators are the result of surveys carried out by private organizations in the absence of any official data: for example the indicator 8.10.2 Proportion of adults (15 years and older) with an account at a bank or other financial institution or with a mobile-money-service provider , from the Gallup World Poll. The UN Global SDG Database set up by the United Nations statistical division6 https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/   6   contains more than 210 SDG Indicators, which are either classified in Tiers I or II. It contains a great deal of missing data, particularly for low-income countries for which statistical capacities are the most limited and for the new issues covered by the SDGs (inequalities, environment and climate, governance, etc.). The classification of an indicator as Tier II is in fact undemanding, as it leaves a missing data rate of up to 50% in one or more of the four major regions as defined by the UN.7 For example, the indicator 16.5.2 Proportion of business (…) that paid a bribe to a public official (…) during the previous 12 months  is classified as Tier I in spite of a very high rate of missing data and is therefore excluded from our list. Moreover, the completion rate of 51% for Europe and North America corresponds to a 100 % rate for Eastern European countries (source: World Bank Doing Business  Survey) and only 11% for the rest of Europe and North America (3 countries only).  7   Moreover, even when an indicator is available for a country over this period, there is often only one or two data items for most. For example, the first and most emblematic indicator in the UN Global SDG Database, 1.1.1 Proportion of the population living below the international poverty line , is filled in for only one year at most over the period 2009–2019 for half of the countries in the base (excluding high-income countries, for which this proportion is almost zero). Most of them are low-income countries with the highest poverty rate. Many other indicators, especially those based on survey data (as many surveys are conducted infrequently in developing countries), also suffer from many missing data so that the time series for these indicators contain an insufficient number of observations for any time analysis. In addition to the problem of missing data, there is a problem related to the comparability of the data; according to Dang and Serajuddin (2020) , who carried out the first in-depth analysis of this database, the UN Global SDG Database consists of data coming from around 200 data sources: (often, with different sources for one indicator, according to countries). However, not only this database contains the values of the official list of SDG Indicators adopted by the UN, but it also provides precise metadata for all indicators whose calculation is supposed to follow the same methodology in each country. These characteristics strongly vindicate the use of this database for any international analysis on this subject.  2.2 A selection of countries & indicators derived from the UN global SDG Database From data of the UN Global SDG Database available for the period 2000–20198 The whole database gathers data dating back to 1974 for some indicators, but we kept data only tracing back to 2000, as our goal is to compare data between countries for the most recent period possible.  8   for the 193 member countries of the United Nations, we have built the largest possible base, respecting the criteria required to carry out our statistical study (Annex 3). After building up our database of 100 indicators (i.e., all the Tier I indicators for which international comparisons are possible) for 193 countries, we removed the countries and variables with too much missing data to be able to analyze them. The selection of the data retained was made according to an iterative process, to maximize the number of countries and indicators for which sufficient data exist for a statistical analysis to be carried out. Since our objective was to conduct a global analysis, we set a maximum missing data rate of 25% for each country, bearing in mind that if we set a more demanding constraint the number of countries retained would have fallen sharply (Fig. 1  ). We set a maximum missing data rate of 20% for the indicators, thus setting a more stringent constraint in this case insofar as it is only from this threshold that the number of indicators retained decreased significantly. Then, we built a data set where, for each cell where data is available, we used the most recent observation available, following the “last observation carried forward” method. In the end, we managed to keep 160 countries (Annex 1) and 79 indicators (Annex 2) on which we are carrying our analysis. Our list of 160 countries covers almost all UN member countries, excluding only around twenty micro-states (which are mostly Small Island Developing States, as defined by the UN) whose statistical capacities do not allow the calculation of SDG indicators, as well as a few countries at war or fragile states,9 See the Fragile States Index (https://fragilestatesindex.org/  ).  9   or without a proper statistical system (Annex 3). This comprehensive list of countries allows us to conduct a relevant analysis at the world level. The selected 79 indicators cover 16 SDGs, with the most recent data varying from 2009 to 2019. Among these indicators, 75 of them are Tier I (including multiple Tiers) and 4 are Tier II indicators (added because they comply with the general rules defined for the selection of indicators). Our database thus includes 85% of the total number of Tier I (and mixed) indicators contained in the UN SDG Database that are relevant for our analysis (see Table 1  ). This percentage varies greatly according to the SDGs. It is 100% for six SDGs: SDG1 (“No Poverty”), SDG7 (“Affordable and Clean Energy”), SDG8 (“Decent work and Economic growth ”), SDG11 (“Sustainable Cities and Communities”), SDG12 (“Responsible Consumption and Production”) and SDG13 (“Climate Action”), for which only one indicator appears in Tier I. The coverage rate is around 90% for SDG3 (“Good Health and Well Being”), 9 (“Industry, innovation and infrastructure“) and 17 (“Partnerships for the goals“). For the remaining SDGs covered in our list of indicators, between two thirds and three quarters of the indicators in Tier I were selected, except for SDG 4 (“Quality education”) and 6 (“Clean water and sanitation”) which have a lower percentage (respectively 60% and 50%). Last of all, we could not retain any indicator for SDG14 (“Life Below Water”), whose indicators do not apply by definition to landlocked countries, so that the coverage rate is zero for this SDG. The average rate of missing data in our database is 6% for both countries and indicators. There are no missing data for 16 countries (mainly in Europe and Latin America) as well as for 30 indicators (more than a third of the total). These indicators, which mostly relate to SDG3 (“Good Health and Well Being”), are calculated by United Nations agencies on the basis of econometric models, which explains the lack of missing data. Missing data rates by group of countries are difficult to interpret, given the fact that we are limited here to Tier I indicators which have the highest data availability among all the SDG indicators, and that some indicators are calculated by the custodian agencies, which masks the missing data of the countries for these indicators. However, we observe that the 20 countries in our database with the highest missing data rates are all developing countries, among which eight are Sub-Saharan African countries. Despite recent progress, this observation confirms the difficulty of African statistical systems in monitoring SDG indicators, given that according to some estimates only just over 40% of SDG indicators have data available in African countries (Sustainable Development Goals Center for Africa, 2019 ).   3 Methodology To analyze the relationships between the 79 indicators selected for our list of 160 countries, we start by standardizing all the variables (indicators).10 Which means subtracting the mean from the value of each indicator and dividing by the standard deviation.  10   We then conduct our data analysis using two standard methods - Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) - that we present in this section. The MFA allows us to study correlations (that is interlinkages) between SDG indicators, and symmetrically proximities between countries for these indicators. The HCA uses the proximity between countries, in order to define clusters of countries that share similar performances in terms of SDG Indicators. Both methods are used in very different domains of social sciences, as well as in agronomy, chemistry, etc. 3.1 Multiple Factor Analysis Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) is employed for the analysis of tables in which observations or individuals are observed within different groups of quantitative variables (Abdi, Williams, & Valentin, 2013; Escoffier and Pages, 1990, 2016 ). It is an extension of the traditional Principal component analysis (PCA) method, which makes it possible to visualize correlations, whether positive or negative, between indicators and therefore helps to identify patterns in the data in the case of large datasets (Joliffe, 2002; Lebart, Morineau, & Warwick, 1984 ). The PCA is based on the principle that a database considered as an I × K matrix (in our case, 160 countries × 79 indicators) can be considered as 2 symmetrical point clouds: the I observations of K variables each can be considered as a cloud of I points in ℝK , and symmetrically, the variables can be considered as a cloud of K points in ℝI . In the case we are studying, two countries observed close together on the point cloud of observations have a similar level of sustainable development (i.e. similar values on the indicators used in relation to the other countries), and two close indicators on the point cloud of countries measure similar phenomena (the distribution of the two phenomena over the countries observed is almost the same). The PCA therefore makes it possible to highlight the structuring relationships that exist within these two clouds, which are symmetrical (dual). Starting with the PCA, we figure out the principal components (i.e. eigenvectors or axes), which are new variables that are constructed as linear combinations of the initial variables. The first principal component axis is calculated in such a manner that it maximizes the variance.11 To be more precise, this component is set such that it contains a maximal amount of the initial variance of the data set.  11   The second axis is calculated in the same way, with the condition that it is orthogonal (that is to say, independent) to the first principal component and that it accounts for the next highest variance, then the third taking into account the previous ones, etc. Selecting only the first few axes allows selecting the most essential information. When the variables are structured into groups as is the case with our data which covers 16 SDGs each constituting a group of indicators, the results of the PCA can however be influenced by the unequal number of variables in each group, as well as by the correlation between the variables of a group: the more these variables are linked, the more this group will influence the determination of the first main axes of the global analysis. To take an example, we have retained 21 indicators for SDG3 in our database, or more than a quarter of the total number of indicators selected, and these indicators are moreover highly correlated. These two characteristics (large number of indicators for this SDG and strong correlation between them) tend to overweight the influence of this SDG over the others in determination of the first axes of the PCA. MFA takes into account the unequal size of groups and intra-group correlations, such as the ones concerning SDGs, referred to above. Like PCA, MFA is a dimension reduction program, which therefore consists in looking for a space ℝL  (L < K) in which the cloud of I observations resembles as much as possible what it looks like in ℝK . For this, the program seeks to construct new variables u1 ,…, uL  called principal components, which replace the K initial variables. MFA is a sequential program that can be summarized in two steps:In a first step, J PCA (where J is the number of groups of variables, i.e. here SDGs) are carried out separately on each group of standardized variables, i.e. on each I × Kj  matrix, where Kj  represents the number of indicators associated with each SDG (the sum of Kj  for all SDGs being equal to K, the total number of SDG indicators in our list).  In a second step, a PCA is carried out on the data matrix I × K, by weighting the variables of each group by the inverse of the respective first eigenvalue of the PCA carried out in the first step. The inverse weighting of the variance λj1  (eigenvalue) of the first component ensures in the PCA of this step that no group alone determines the first axis. According to Escoffier and Pagès (ibidem), the optimal representation of the data matrix I × K is the one obtained by this weighted PCA.    At the end of the MFA, we obtain a set of variances of the principal components classified: λ1  ≥… ≥ λL . The choice of the value of L (L can go from 1 to K), that is of the number of principal components to be retained, is left to the user of the program, because it is at this moment that a compromise is made between exhaustiveness of the information of the base retained and reduction of the dimension. Symmetrically to the principal components u1 ,…, uL  found for the variables, the MFA allows to find the principal components for the individuals v1 , …, vL , and thus write the initial database as a sum of K matrices, of which the last K - L terms (with L chosen judiciously) can be considered as negligible (since the λk  decrease with k). The choice of the number of principal components to be retained for the analysis can be done by a variety of methods. We used the scree test method (Cattell, 1966 ): this method consists in identifying a breaking point in the graphical representation (scree plot) of the variances classified in decreasing order of the K potential principal components. Indeed, the scree plot makes it possible to identify the moment when the addition of an additional principal component does not bring a supplement of substantial information compared to the previous ones. We have chosen to use this method because it is not totally automatic (it leaves the user some leeway in the choice of L, depending on the interpretation made of the first principal components), and ensures not to make a completely arbitrary choice. MFA thus makes it possible to switch from an I × K base to an I × L base, which is more easily analyzed and interpretable. Indeed, the L principal components can be used to understand the relationships between the K initial variables: since they are linear combinations whose variance is maximized, the principal components transcribe as much as possible the variance common to several variables. Above all, the principal components make it possible to project the J groups of variables there, since they participate in their construction, and thus to understand the influence that a group of indicators has on the construction of a principal component, in addition to understand the influence of indicators one by one. We can thus study the contribution of each variable xk  (1 ≤ k ≤ K) and of each group of variables Xj  (1 ≤ j ≤ J), knowing that the contribution of each group of variables is the sum of the contributions of all the variables which belong to this group, to each principal component ul . These contributions help us to identify the most contributory variables and groups to the L principal components retained, whose interconnections structure the original data the most. These indicators represent how much the variance of a principal component can be accounted by the variance of a given variable or set of variables. Just as we can study the positioning of the variables with respect to the principal components, the MFA also makes it possible to calculate the RV coefficient. This indicator, which functions as an extension of the Pearson linear correlation coefficient for variables, measures the strength of the association between two groups of variables, and therefore in our analysis, between two SDGs (​Robert and Escoufier, 1976 ). It is calculated as the similarity between two point configurations induced by two different groups of variables.  3.2 Hierarchical Cluster Analysis The Hierarchical Cluster Analysis method (HCA) makes it possible to measure the proximity between countries. This method measures the distance between two countries using the distance between the standardized SDG indicators values for each of those countries. It uses this distance to construct homogeneous groups of countries, for which it maximizes the within-group variance and maximizes the between-group variance. To summarize the information for all countries, we apply Ward's hierarchical automatic clustering method on the principal components obtained by the MFA. Indeed, as explained by Lebart, Morineau and Warwick (1984), “it is of value to use clustering analysis to summarize the configuration of points obtained from a principal component analysis” . Ward's method makes it possible in particular to produce a partition without having to decide ex-an te on the number of desired clusters, by taking into account the variations of intra-cluster and inter-cluster variances, in a manner analogous to the selection of the principal components of the MFA. Hierarchical clustering analysis methods make it possible to group points into gradually agglomerated clusters. The result of these methods is a hierarchy of partitions, not a single partition, calculated using the following procedure: 1. Calculation of the distance between all possible pairs of points in the cloud; 2. Aggregation of the 2 points whose distance is minimum; 3. Repeat steps 1 and 2, with the following distance between 2 aggregations C1  (made up of points, ie vectors, x) and C2  (made up of points, ie vectors, y) of size n1  and n2  (1 point being a single point aggregation). The choice of the number of clusters (country groupings) in the HCA is made similarly as for the choice of the number of principal components to be retained for the MFA: the between-group variance of the partition decreases with each iteration of the algorithm, and therefore we can identify a break point on the variance scree plot. To guarantee the robustness of the chosen clustering, we consolidated it by means of a Hartigan-Wong mobile center algorithm (Hartigan & Wong, 1979 ), repeated thirty times and leading each time to the same clustering. This algorithm is a clustering method where the desired number of clusters is chosen by the user (here, deduced from the results of Ward's classification), which allows to find the clustering which has the highest between-group variance.  3.3 Missing data imputation The MFA and HCA methods described above require imputing missing data. As noted, 30 indicators have no missing data. To impute the remaining 49 indicators without building 49 imputation models, we adopted a mean substitution method. This technique was favored for two main reasons: (1) first, it does not require any auxiliary information, which would imply making hypotheses on the correlations between SDG Indicators and external variables; (2) furthermore, unlike a donor imputation technique which consists of imputing the missing data by copying another country’s with similar characteristics data, this imputation method automatically reduces the variance of the imputed indicators (since missing data is imputed by the mean and therefore the most imputed indicators have more concentrated distributions to the mean). As the aim of the MFA is to identify the most discriminating variables (with variances greater than the others), this method makes it possible to reduce in our analysis the relative importance of variables with a lot of missing data compared to well measured variables with few missing data. The mean imputation was carried out within country groupings, by imputing by the average in the four classes of countries calculated by the World Bank from the GNI/capita.12 The four groups of countries are defined as follows (as of July 1, 2020): high income (GNI / capita ˃ 12.536 USD); upper middle income (4.046 USD <GNI / capita < 12.535 USD); lower middle income (1.036 USD < GNI / capita < 4.045 USD); low income (GNI / capita < 1.035 USD).  12   Indeed, we consider that the GNI/capita and this classification are benchmarks for international comparisons in development economics, and therefore that this framework can serve our analysis on the SDGs.13 We also carried out our analysis on a data set imputed through mean imputation without using country groupings, and found very similar results, to the results we present thereafter. This means that our imputation method has a very limited impact on the country groupings defined by the HCA in section 4.  13   The results that we comment on in the following section come from the calculations carried out on this basis, the missing data of which were imputed as explained above.   4 Results In this section, we start by applying to our database the MFA whose methodology was presented in the previous section, which highlights the SDGs and associated indicators that most differentiate countries from each other. Based on the MFA we then perform an HCA to group the countries into relatively homogeneous clusters in terms of SDG performance. 4.1 Human development is a key factor differentiating countries The results of the MFA lead us to analyze the first three axes of the principal components, which together explain 42% of the total variance of the base (Fig. 2  ). The first axis of the MFA explains 30% of the variance. The first four SDGs (SDG1-4), which cover the essential dimensions of human development, are those that contribute the most to this axis (along with SDGs 8 and 17), the contribution of an SDG to an axis being calculated as the sum of the contributions of the monitoring indicators for this SDG (Table 2  ). These SDGs (with SDG 7 “Affordable and clean energy”) are also the most one-dimensional, i.e. those with the strongest correlation between the associated indicators, and therefore the best represented on this axis.14 Thus, 80% of the variance of SDG1 (“No Poverty”) is explained by the first axis of the PCA carried out on each SDG separately (more than 50% for SDGs 2–4 and 71% for SDG7), which represents the maximum of all SDGs.  14   These SDGs concern human development as traditionally defined by the UNDP in its three dimensions of income and standards of living / health / education. The indicators of these SDGs that contribute the most to axis 1 are the following: 1.4.1 Proportion of population using basic sanitation services,  and far behind 1.1.1 Proportion of the population living below the international poverty line  (SDG1 “No Poverty”);  2.2.1 Prevalence of children moderately or severely stunted  (SDG2 “Zero Hunger”), an indicator obviously related to the health thematic although it belongs to SDG2, and 2.1.1 Prevalence of undernourishment ; 4.1.2 Completion rate at the end of lower secondary education  and 4.2.2 Participation rate in organized learning  (SDG4 “Quality Education”). SDG3 (“Good Health and Well-Being”) is the one that contributes the most to this axis, but without its indicators appearing in the first rank of contributions to axis 1. This particularity lies in the principle of the MFA, which underweights the SDGs made up of many highly correlated indicators. The indicators for this SDG appear thus quite low in the list, the first two being 3.8.1 Coverage of essential health services: universal health coverage index  and 3.2.2 Neonatal mortality rate , two indicators that are highly correlated with almost all of the other indicators in this SDG.15 Of the 21 SDG3 indicators in our selection, 18 are highly correlated with each other. Only 3 indicators are exceptions by being very little correlated to the others and to each other: these are indicators 3.4.2 Suicide mortality rate , 3,5,2 Alcohol per capita consumption  and 3.a.1 Prevalence of current tobacco use .  15   In addition to these four SDGs, two other SDGs contribute a lot to this axis; first of all, SDG17 (“Partnerships for the Goals”) and especially two indicators concerning internet access (17.8.1 Internet users  and 17.6.1 Fixed internet broadband subscriptions , both measured per 100 inhabitants); SDG8 (“Decent work and economic growth “) also ranks high in terms of contribution to this axis, with two indicators such as 8.7.1 Proportion of children engaged in economic activity  and 8.10.2 Proportion of adults with an account at a bank or financial institution or with a mobile-money-service provider . The strong contribution of these two SDGs shows the close link between access to internet and to banking and the development of a country, and therefore the importance of the digital and financial divide between developed and developing countries. The economic dimension (income and standards of living) of human development appears prominently on this axis, which is closely correlated (0.72) with GNI/capita.16 GNI/capita, Atlas Method, current $ as figured by the World Bank. All data are for 2019, except for Iran, Kuwait and Yemen (2018), Syria (2007) and Venezuela (2014).  16   On this axis 1, the countries are thus opposed to each other quite distinctly according to their level of income per capita: the countries of sub-Saharan Africa, which are the poorest of our list, are opposed according to this axis to the most developed countries (Fig. 3  ). Overall, we find the well-known correlation between income level and the other components of human development (Deaton, 2010, 2013; Pritchett, 2020; Yakunina & Bychkov, 2015 ). However, we should not interpret these results, especially the major contribution of human development to the total variance of the data, as establishing a hierarchy in terms of development components. The size of this contribution is partly because the list of SDGs is skewed towards human development, and there are many SDGs (which are highly correlated between themselves) related to this issue.17 Even if (as we saw in the previous section) we avoid overweighting the best-represented SDGs (see SDG3, whose indicators represent two thirds of the indicators linked to the first four SDGs), by reducing the weight of their indicators in the analysis.  17   To take an example, there is only one SDG for new issues such as governance and institutions, in spite that many usually also consider them as strongly linked to development (Chang, 2011; Pritchett, 2020 ). In addition, some indicators that are at the core of development policies might rank relatively low among the contributors to this axis (or to others) because they are important for some countries only but not for others. For example, this is a case to a certain extent of indicator 1.1.1. Proportion of the population living below the international poverty line , which is the most well known SDG indicator. It could seem a bit surprising that this indicator ranks only 12th for its contribution to axis 1. We can explain this relatively low ranking by the fact that this traditional measure of monetary poverty is not very relevant for middle income and even less for high-income countries. Indeed, extreme poverty measured as people living on less than $ 1.25 a day is almost non-existent in these countries (except for lower-middle income African countries).  4.2 A Kuznets-type curve between human development and inequality & the environment The second factor axis explains 7% of the total variance. Four SDGs related to the environment, which correspond to the third pillar of sustainable development, are the main contributors to this axis (Table 2 ). These are: SDG15 (“Life on land”), with indicators such as 15.1.2 Average proportion of terrestrial key biodiversity areas covered by protected areas  and 15.1.1 Forest area as a proportion of total land area;  SDG9 (“Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure”), with 9.4.1 Carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP;  SDG11 (“Sustainable Cities and Communities”) with 11.6.2 Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter in cities;  and SDG7 (“Affordable and clean energies”), with indicators such as 7.2.1 Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption,  and 7.1.1 Proportion of population with access to electricity . As on the first factor axis, a cumulative effect still seems to be at work: targeting one topic of environmental protection seems closely linked to targeting all topics. Social and gender inequality indicators contribute to this axis. In particular, some indicators concerning the share of women in various professional fields: 5.5.1 Proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments  and 5.5.2 Proportion of women in managerial positions  (both of SDG5 “Gender equality”), and one indicator of SDG16 (“Peace Justice and Strong Institutions”) that is 16.7.1 Ratio of the proportion of women in parliament in the proportion of women in the national population  (an indicator very close to the previous one). Some indicators of SDG10 (“Reduced Inequalities”) such as 10.4.1 Labour share of GDP  and 10.a.1 Proportion of tariff lines applied to imports from least developed countries and developing countries with zero-tariff,  are among the main contributors. A parabolic pattern appears on Fig. 3  representing the first plane (axes 1 and 2). This “Guttman effect” (Guttman, 1953 ) is common in factor analysis. As underlined by Camiz (2005) , “this parabolic shape is very informative of a particular data structure, where the data are influenced by a major underlying factor that has a unimodal relation with the variables”  – a remark that precisely applies to the characteristics of our data, the major underlying factor being GNI/capita in our case. As shown in Fig. 3 , there is a quadratic relationship between factors 2 and 1:- at the left top end of the tail, the poorest countries, which are mostly African countries, are characterized by good scores on the environmental and inequality indicators selected; they are less densely populated, less urbanized, and often less polluted (especially in terms of fine particulates18 The annual mean levels of fine particulate matter in Sub-Saharan Africa is much higher than the world average, and four times its average level in Europe-North America. However, there is strong variation of the value of this indicator on the continent, and some African countries have in fact a very low level of fine particulate matter (especially in Southern Africa).  18   and to a certain extent of CO2 emissions/GDP); they may have in some cases more forest and more protected areas; they also use mostly wood for cooking and heating, which is considered as a renewable energy, and few fossil energies because of their low industrial development; inequalities are also relatively low, as measured by indicators such as the labour share of GDP (which is among the highest of our country list);  - the richest countries are situated at the right top end of the tail; they pollute also less than the rest of the world (emissions of fine particulates and of CO2/GDP), thanks to their restrictive environmental policies, but generally consume less renewable energy (except for some Scandinavian countries); the same countries which are most committed to their environmental development also take the most measures to reduce gender and social inequalities (a paragon of this is Sweden, which is the third country of the database which emits the least CO2 per unit of GDP, and the fourth country whose national parliament has the most women);  - the Gulf countries are represented at the bottom of Fig. 2 ; they distinguish by their mediocre performance in the field of ecology and the environment (CO2/GDP, fine particulates, etc.), consuming no renewable energy, which is due to their status as oil-producing countries; they are also far behind when it comes to gender equality and to the share of labour in GDP; large emerging countries, such as China and India, are close to this group, as they also have poor performances in the field of the environment.    As factor 2 includes both environmental and inequality dimensions, this corresponds to a combined Kuznets curve (Kuznets, 1955 ) and environmental Kuznets curve (Grossman & Krueger, 1993; Shafik & Bandyopadhyay, 1992 ). According to the former, inequality rises in the early stages of economic development and then falls after reaching a threshold income per capita. According to the latter, the same kind of relationship exists with pollution and the degradation of environment, which increases until also reaching a threshold income per capita. This rise in income per capita then corresponds to an increasing demand for environmental quality. These curves are inverted U-curves, whereas we have here a U-curve because of the construction of the second axis.19 In the Kuznets curve, going up along axis 2 means that inequalities are increasing, whereas it is by construction the opposite on our curve. The same applies to environmental degradation.  19   This suggests that there is also a relationship between the environment and gender inequalities. It is consistent with OECD (2021) , according to gender equality and environmental goals are mutually reinforcing. Although the quadratic fit is of good quality, it is a bit delicate to interpret this curve for three reasons. First , axis 2 is a linear combination of indicators, but there is no strong quadratic fit between GNI/capita and each of the indicators, which contribute the most to this axis. If we estimate simple quadratic regressions on each indicator taken separately and GNI/capita, except for indicator 7.2.1 Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption  (for which the R2 amounts to 0.28).20 For four other indicators (15.1.2 Protected terrestrial KBA , 11.6.2 Fine particulates , 10.a.1 0-tariff for LDCs  and 9.4.1 CO2 emissions/GDP),  the quadratic coefficient is significantly different from zero, but with a much lower R2 (between 0.04 and 0.13).  20  Second , most of these indicators are rather indirect measures of environment and inequalities. For example, axis 2 relies heavily on the renewable energy share indicator, the meaning of which is ambiguous. Indeed, the poorest countries mainly use renewable energies (wood) in their energy consumption, which can actually have a very negative impact on deforestation and therefore on the environment. In the case of other developing countries and rich countries which generally use mainly oil and coal for their final energy consumption, the objective is instead to increase the share of renewables (the EU has set a 50% renewable energy target by 2030), some European countries being particularly advanced in this area. Likewise, the indicator 10.4.1 Labour share of GDP  is not a precise indicator of inequality, since poor countries can both have a high share of labour in GDP and high levels of income inequality (for Africa, see Chancel et al., 2019 ).21 More precise indicators of inequality, such as the Gini coefficient have been included in the list of SDG indicators, but are classified in Tier II due to their high percentage of missing data, especially in developing countries.  21  Third , we tried to check further the relationship between human development and inequalities/the environment, using an alternative method that consisted of making a selection of the indicators most related to each of this thematic, and then measuring the relationship between them. We found a high linear correlation between indicators related to human development and inequalities/the environment (R2 = 0.60), but no parabolic pattern appears (annex 4). To observe the correlations between the SDG Indicators, we placed the 25 best-represented indicators on axes 1 and 2 inside a correlation circle (Fig. 4). To make the chart more readable, we have reverse coded some indicators, when approaching the target related to these indicators implies reducing the value of this indicator. Such is the case for example for indicators 1.1.1. Proportion of the population living below the international poverty line  and 6.2.1 Proportion of population practicing open defecation . After making this correction, which ensures a common directionality of all indicators, indicator 1.1.1 on Poverty  appears as expected very close to 7.1.1 Proportion of population with access to electricity , and indicator 6.2.1 on Open defecation  to 1.4.1 Proportion of population using basic sanitation services . This proximity indicates that for each of these pairs of indicators there is a very strong correlation between the indicators. As can be seen on Fig. 4  , where the indicators best represented on axes 1 and 2 are near the circle, all but one of these indicators are positively correlated with one another (after reverse coding), with one exception only. Indeed, they are all located in the two right quadrants of the circle, which indicates a positive correlation between them, with the exception of 7.2.1 Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption  (SDG 7 “Affordable Clean Energy”). This negative correlation is in fact interpretable when taking into account, as mentioned above, that for low-income countries, reducing (and not increasing) the share of renewable energy in the short term might be beneficial to their environment. Furthermore, six SDGs, which are among the biggest contributors to these axes, are the only ones that maintain strong links between them, according to the measurement of the RV coefficient (Table 3  ). SDGs 1–4 are also all linked to SDG7, as well as SDG17 (except SDG4). The links with the other SDGs and between these other SDGs are much smaller. More generally, when we seek to move closer to one of the aforementioned SDGs, we will also de facto  move closer to the other SDGs related to it, because of the positive correlation between the different components of human development. In terms of human development, the SDGs are therefore rather cumulative than contradictory.  4.3 Governance, an additional dimension of sustainable development One of the goals of the SDGs is the introduction of an additional dimension of sustainable development, governance, as a measure of the functioning of institutions and the quality of public policies. The third factor axis of the MFA, which brings together 5% of the variance remaining in the base after construction of the first two factor axes, illustrates to a certain extent this dimension of sustainable development. Indeed, the variables whose variance is mainly carried by the third factor axis are variables falling within this concept in the broad sense, linked to the quality of public policies, including in terms of the environment (Table 2 ). These include indicators on the quality of institutions and their inclusiveness, which go well beyond SDG16 (“Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions”) which is the SDG most focused on this issue: 16.1.1 Homicide rate  (SDG16), 5.5.2 Proportion of women in managerial positions  (SDG5) and 15.5.1 Red list index  (SDG15), the latter measuring the extinction risk of threatened species in each country (this index varies between 0 and 1, the higher the index value, the lower the risk of threatened species). Two groups of countries, which contribute the most to this axis, oppose each other. A first group comprises mostly Latin American countries: they combine a high homicide rate (the highest in the world with South Africa, which also belongs to this list) with a high proportion of women in managerial positions, and a generally low Red list index. A second group comprises three European countries (Luxembourg, Denmark and Germany) and a few Arabic countries (especially from the Middle East), which combine a low homicide rate, a low share of women in managerial functions (especially in Middle East countries), and a high Red list index.  4.4 The overall consistency between global results and results on country groupings Are the results at the global level just an effect of averaging? Indeed, one might hypothesize that the average hides different geographical realities in each group of countries, without any relation between them, thereby removing any meaning from these global results. In order to answer this question, we proceeded in two steps. First, we grouped all 160 countries in our database into consistent clusters, performing a HCA. Rather than measuring the distance on the raw standardized variables, we preferred, according to common practice, to take into account for each country its coordinate on each axis of the MFA to reduce statistical noise. The HCA empirically groups countries into three clusters (Annex 1), which happens to be mostly according to their economic development, as measured by their GNI/capita:• A first group (46 countries)., which we call “poor countries”, is composed of lower-middle income and low income countries; this group includes mostly sub-Saharan African countries (34 out of 46); apart from Haiti, all the remaining countries are in Asia (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, Pakistan, etc.).  • A second group (72 countries), which we call “intermediate countries”, is mostly composed of (higher- and lower-) middle income countries; only 10 high income countries belong to this group; apart from Mauritius, 4 of them are oil producers from the Arabic Peninsula (Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia), another 5 being small Latin American countries (Bahamas, Barbados, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago and Uruguay); only 6 Sub-Saharan countries (Botswana, Cabo Verde, Gabon, Mauritius, Namibia and South Africa) belong to this group;  • A third group (42 countries), which we call “rich countries”, is composed of high income countries according to the World Bank classification, with two exceptions only (Belarus and Bulgaria); all OECD (except for Colombia, Mexico and Turkey) and all European Union and EFTA22 The European Free Trade Area (EFTA) comprises Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.  22   countries (+United Kingdom) belong to this group, as well as Singapore, the Seychelles and the United Arab Emirates;    In a second step, we conducted separate MFAs for each of these three groups of countries (Table 4  ). As mentioned before, the fact that some SDGs or indicators contribute more than others to the main principal components should be interpreted with caution. An indicator might have a modest contribution to an axis for two alternative reasons. The indicator could reach a very high value for all the countries of the group, with little variance (e.g. 2.2.1 Prevalence of stunting  in poor countries), without differentiating the countries of this group much from each other. On the contrary, its value might be almost zero for these countries, which means it is therefore irrelevant (e.g. 1.1.1 Proportion of the population living below the international poverty line  in rich countries). It is only on a case-by-case basis that one can decide between these two types of effect. Four main results emerge from this detailed analysis, which confirm the validity of the overall results obtained. First , the variance explained by the main axes is lower when we conduct the MFA separately for each group of countries. While it is equal to 42 % for the first three axes at the global level, the share of variance explained by these axes in the analyses by country groupings is between 29 % (poor countries) and 36 % (rich countries) only. It reaches only 12 % (poor countries) to 18 % (rich countries) for the first axis (compared to 30% at the global level), the intermediate countries being within this range for these two percentages (Table 3 ). The associations between the SDGs calculated by the RV coefficient also become systematically lower. This means that the correlations between SDGs and indicators are lower in each sub-group: the unexplained share of noise is therefore higher in each group of countries than at the global level, and we are less able to explain the variance between countries for these groups, which are more homogeneous. Second , the correlation between axis 1 and GNI/capita is very important for each group of countries, although a little lower than it is at the global level. It thus stands at 0.58 for rich countries, at 0.55 for intermediate countries and at 0.58 for poor countries. This means that the level of economic development is as much predominant in explaining the differentiation of indicators, in particular in terms of human development in the broad sense (mostly SDGs 1 to 4), in each group of countries as it is at the global level. Third , and consistent with the above result, the SDGs playing an important role in the analysis at the global level also generally do so regardless of the group of countries (Table 4 ). This is especially the case with SDGs 1, 2, 3 and 17 for axis 1, for SDGs 5 and 11 for axis 2, and for SDGs 16 and 17 for axis 3. This means that these first three axes correspond to the same theme in the broad sense regardless of the group of countries, even if the most contributing indicators within each SDG may vary from one group to another. Looking at it in more detail, we observe the same stability for each of the first two axes (not so much for the third one, which is understandable as it represents a small share of variance only):- six indicators are among the top thirteen contributors for axis 1 at the global level and for each country grouping; two indicators of SDG 1 related to poverty (1.1.1 Proportion of the population living below the international poverty line ; 1.4.1 Proportion of population using basic sanitation services ), one indicator related to education (4.1.2 Completion rate at the end of lower secondary ), another indicator about living conditions (11.1.1 Proportion of urban population living in slums ) and two indicators related to access to internet (17.6.1 Fixed Internet broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants ; 17.8.1: Internet users per 100 inhabitants );  - five indicators are among the top eleven contributors for axis 2 at the global level and for each country grouping; these are three indicators related to gender inequalities (5.5.1 Proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments ; 5.5.2 Proportion of women in managerial positions ; 16.7.1 Ratio for female members of parliaments ) and two indicators related to the environment (11.6.2 Annual mean levels of fine particulate matters in all areas ; 15.1.1 Forest area as a proportion of total land area ).    Fourth , the MFA highlights the proximity between intermediate and poor countries (which all are classified as developing countries by the United Nations) for the SDGs contributing the most to axes 1 and 2. This is especially the case for SDG3, SDG1, SDG7 and SDG17, which are the first four contributors to axis 1 in both country groupings. This does not mean that these SDGs have the same values for the indicators related to these SDGs, but rather that these SDGs are equally important for differentiating these developing countries in terms of human development, whatever their development level. For axis 2, three SDGs (SDG5-10–15) are among the main contributors in both country groupings. For axis 3, no common pattern appears between the three country groupings.   5 Conclusion As underlined by Kanbur et al. (2018) , the measurement of economic performance and social progress faces the inevitable and enduring tension between the pull to broaden and expand indicators on the one hand, and the imperative to retain a relatively small number of top-level indicators on the other. Following the adoption of the SDGs in 2015, the drawing up of an extensive list of several hundreds of indicators by the UN to assess and monitor progress towards each of the targets of the Agenda 2030 represents a move in the former direction. It is widely recognized that the theoretical foundations of SDGs are weak (Bali Swain & Yang Wallentin, 2020; ICSU & ISSC, 2015 ), and that this is a result of the very process which led to their adoption in the first place. Given the very empirical nature of the SDGs and the lack of a global model, it is understandable that although the three main axes of our analysis explain more than 40% of the variance in our database, there remains a significant level of statistical noise. At the same time, our analysis of the data shows that there is both thematic and geographic consistency regarding the SDGs. The results of the Multiple Factor and Hierarchical Cluster analyses conducted in this paper show that there exists strong (mostly positive) interlinkages between Sustainable Development Goal Indicators. They also show important differences between countries for these indicators. These SDGs are mostly related to economic and social factors (human development), and to a lesser extent, to the environment, inequalities and governance. Additionally, we reveal the existence of a sort of combined Kuznets inequality and environmental curves, which needs to be further investigated. On the other hand, the breakdown of our selection into three groups of countries, which results from this analysis, shows the same kinds of interlinkages for these groups. Even if this observation confirms the robustness of our results, it would be necessary in the future when new data will be available to renew this cross section analysis to check the robustness of these results over time. Although our intention was to broaden the “beyond GDP” approach as mentioned above, our results underline the fact that the differences between countries for SDG indicators derive primarily from their level of economic development, as measured by their income per capita. These results have important implications for development policies, bearing in mind that we have not conducted causality analyses here but only correlation analyses. Thus, it can be inferred that successful development policies are indeed policies of structural change that contribute to increasing the level of per capita income and human development in parallel (Pritchett, 2020; Stiglitz, 1998 ). Although they are connected to both of these elements, the environment and gender & social inequalities, seem to represent partially different dimensions. Last of all, this paper highlights the fact that, at the start of the 2020s, and more than five years after their adoption, SDGs today are still very incompletely measured. Indeed, there are still about a hundred indicators that are not regularly produced in a majority of countries and of the population in every region of the world (i.e. those classified as Tier II), most of which relate to the new issues covered such as Environment-Climate and Governance. Even those indicators considered as measured in a majority of countries (i.e. Tier I) still suffer from serious problems of data collection. This limits the robustness of the quantitative analyses carried out here, particularly as concerns these aforementioned issues. In the future, the progress of interlinkage analyses will ultimately depend on improving the quantity and quality of the available SDG statistics.  After all, this is no more than what are precisely referred to as the very last two SDG targets.

Those duplicates, not included in the data set, are noted in italics in the annex above.  Annex 3 Criteria used to select the list of countries and indicators For the purposes of our analysis, we needed to meet the following four conditions:1. indicators for which data exist for a sufficient number of countries, which led us to limit ourselves to 130 indicators in Tier I and 4 indicators with multiple Tiers, and to exclude indicators in Tier II (with 4 exceptions, for reasons detailed below);  2. indicators expressed in the form of continuous numerical variables, which excludes in particular dichotomous variables (participation in an international agreement, for example) or ordinal variables for which our analysis methodology is unsuitable;23 Multiple factor analysis can take into account dichotomous or ordinal variables, but as separate groups of variables. Taking this into account would greatly complicate the analysis of the results.  23    3. indicators expressed as a ratio, in order to be able to compare countries with each other regardless of their size;  4. variables relevant for all the countries studied and which therefore do not concern only a sub-group of countries.    This last criterion is the most difficult to implement: for example, we had to exclude from our list indicator 14.5.1 Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas  (SDG14 “Life Below Water”), which only concerns countries with a seafront and cannot be calculated for a landlocked country. Conversely, we considered that it was necessary to keep indicator 1.1.1 Proportion of the population living below the international poverty line.  This is because, even if its value is 0 for all rich countries, this indicator can be calculated regardless of the level of development of a country. The same is true for indicator 3.3.3 Malaria incidence per 1,000 population , which concerns only tropical countries, but which is equal to 0 in all other countries. Among the 130 Tier I indicators and 4 multiple Tier indicators, we therefore excluded 34 indicators that did not meet these conditions. We then selected a single indicator to represent each of the remaining 100 Tier I indicators. Many of the SDG Indicators are in fact broken down into several sub-indicators, in the UN Global SDG Database, so that the base includes a total amount of 531 indicators (not taking into account regional, gender, age breakdown, etc.).24 This is more than twice the number of SDG indicators, bearing in mind that several Tier II indicators are not included in the UN Global SDG Database.  24   For each indicator, we selected a single sub-indicator, choosing the one with the lowest rate of missing data and the most variance. We also drew up four indicators classified as Tier II, which were initially classified as Tier I when the list of indicators was drawn up in 2017, by applying the same rules that we applied to select the Tier I indicators used in the base:- The first (1.3.1 Proportion of population above statutory pensionable age receiving a pension ), because the data are sufficiently well completed at the time of writing our study to meet the Tier I classification criterion;  - The following two (6.2.1 Proportion of population practicing open defecation  and 8.7.1 Proportion of children engaged in economic activity ), because the high rate of missing data in the countries of Europe and North America which led to their classification in Tier II actually covers a zero value of the indicator in these countries, as shown by the few responses provided by the countries in this group;  - Finally, the last indicator (16.1.1 Number of victims of intentional homicide ) was included because the data in the UN SDG Database only present detailed data disaggregated by sex with a high missing data rate, while the overall national data collected by the custodian agency (UNODC) presents a coverage rate that respects the Tier I classification criterion (this last indicator being the only one for which we used data not coming from the UN Global SDG database, but which constitutes an aggregation of the data by gender contained in this base and are therefore consistent with them).    Then, we imputed manually, after systematic verification on other international data sources, the missing data for 14 indicators:- in high income countries, data were set to 0 for 10 indicators (after thorough checking international data sources); 6.2.1 Proportion of population practicing open defecation , 8.7.1 Prevalence of children engaged in economic activities,  2.2.1 Prevalence of children moderately or severely stunted , 2.2.2 Prevalence of children moderately or severely wasted  and 3.3.3 Malaria incidence  (also corrected for a few other countries),25 The list of malaria-free countries has been checked on the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention: https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/travelers/country_table/a.html  (accessed April 21, 2021).  25   5.3.2 Proportion of girls and women who have undergone female genital mutilation/cutting, 5.3.1. Proportion of women aged 20 –24 years who were married or in a union before age 18,  1.5.1–11.5.1–13.1.1 Number of deaths, missing persons and directly affected persons attributed to disasters  and 11.1.1 Proportion of urban population living in slums, informal settlements or inadequate housing  and 12.c.1 Amount of fossil-fuel subsidies per unit of GDP ; in this same group of countries, the data were set to 100 for the indicator 3.7.1 Proportion of women of reproductive age who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods ;  - for the countries of the European Union, which are part of a customs union and therefore all practice the same customs duties vis-à-vis the rest of the world, the indicator 17.10.1 Worldwide weighted tariff-average , which had not been completed for any EU country, has been imputed with the EU figure filled in in the base.  - in low income countries, two very poorly completed indicators were corrected by setting their value to 0 (knowing that the countries in this group that transmitted their data had very low values for these indicators), namely 9.5.2 Researchers (in full-time equivalent) per million inhabitants  and 9.4.1 CO2 emissions per unit of GDP ;    We then studied the distribution of the number of missing data by country for this database, and started by eliminating the countries whose percentage of missing data is greater than 25%. As mentioned in section 2, the number of countries retained would have fallen sharply if we had set a more demanding constraint (Fig. 1 ). By doing so, 33 countries were removed from the base. Most of them (22) are microstates, and more particularly Small Island Developing States with populations of at most a few hundred thousand inhabitants,26 Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Comoros, Djibouti, Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Liechtenstein, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Monaco, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, San Marino, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.  26   which due to their small size do not have the capacity to produce the numerous SDG Indicators. In addition, there are five countries at war or fragile states (Chad, Eritrea, Libya, Somalia and South Sudan), and finally six countries on the fringes of the international statistical system for various reasons (Bahrein, Brunei, Cuba,Equatorial Guinea, North Korea and Turkmenistan). We then removed the indicators for which the missing data rate is higher than 20% (this threshold is lower for indicators than for countries, because the missing data is lower for indicators). By analogy with the method used by the IAEG-SDG for classifying indicators, we checked if the missing data rate exceeded 50% for one of the four groups of countries defined according to the World Bank classification by income level. Because of the imputation method we are using (see section 3), it is necessary to avoid imputing more data than there is data available in each of these groups for the indicators concerned. Only for indicator 9.4.1 (CO2 emissions per unit of GDP ), this missing data rate is above this threshold for low-income countries (58%). Finally, we decided to identify a threshold at which the data was considered too old, and that it was better to have missing data rather than old data that would skew the analysis. To determine this threshold, we studied how the percentage of missing data changed in the database based on the oldest year for which we allowed data to be present, and not that we replaced it with missing data. After observing these results, we decided to delete all the data for which the last available data was strictly prior to 2009, which allowed us to keep the most recent data over a period of 10 years. This led us to drop only one indicator (3.8.2 Proportion of population with large household expenditures on health greater than 10% ), for which the response rate then exceeded the threshold of 25% of missing data set.27 For indicators 8.1.1 and 8.2.1 (respectively Annual growth rate of real GDP per capita and per person employed ), we calculated a geometric mean of the data available each year between 2009 and 2019, which was possible because we have data for all years and for all countries for these two indicators. It was better to take this average growth rate into account rather than the annual growth rate by country for the last year, which would have made our analysis too sensitive to the year chosen.  27   In the end, we observe a maximum of 21.5% of missing data for countries (Fiji) and 22.5% for indicators (indicator 9.5.2 Researchers (in full-time equivalent) per million inhabitants ).  Annex 4 An alternative method to estimate the relationship between human development and inequalities/the environment To check further the relationship between human development and inequalities/the environment, we conducted an additional analysis, separating indicators contributing to axis 1 and indicators contributing to axis 2. In order to do so, we selected 31 indicators that measure components of human development and that contribute the most to axis 1 (as we observe axis 1 is mainly composed of indicators traditionally used for measuring human development), and 20 indicators that contribute the most to axis 2, and that are related to inequalities and the environment. The indicators selected amount respectively to 74% and 77% of the variance of the first two axes of the MFA. The two lists of indicators do not overlap. We then ran two separate Principal Component Analyses (PCAs) on those two sub-groups of indicators, and looked at how countries were projected on the first axis of each of the PCAs.28 We ran PCAs and not MFAs because it does not make sense to group indicators by SDGs as we did not keep all the indicators of our database, and as these indicators are assumed to measure a common phenomenon (human development for axis 1, inequalities and environmental progress for axis 2).  28   We observe that the first axis of the PCA made of indicators related to human development amounts to 65% of the variance of these indicators, whereas for the indicators related to inequalities and the environment, the first axis of the PCA amounts to 19% only of the variance of those indicators. When plotting the first axis of the PCA on indicators measuring human development against the first axis of the PCA (Figure Annex 4  ) on indicators measuring inequalities and the environment, we observe a high linear correlation (R2 = 0.60). The parabolic pattern observed on the first plane of the MFA seems flattened along a 39° line. The two concepts measured by axis 1 and 2 of the MFA are strongly linked to a same factor, which is GNI/capita (the first axis of each of those sub-PCAs are respectively correlated at 0.69 and 0.66 to GNI/capita).
