               Innovative materials and processes are imperative for the comprehensive treatment of wastewater to meet sustainable development goals (SDGs) for 2030 stipulated in the United Nations agenda. The SDGs include the reduction of waste by minimizing the discharge of hazardous chemicals into water resources, as well as recycling and reuse. Incomplete treatment of wastewater may reduce primary pollutants but produce significant amounts of toxic intermediates. Ozonation, a promising wastewater treatment option, directly contributes to oxidizing of double bonds and the destruction of aromatic rings of the primary organic pollutant. However, intermediates such as aldehydes, ketones, and acids accumulate, and complete mineralization is not achieved. Ozonation may be intensified with heterogeneous catalysis for sustained generation of nonspecific oxidants, namely, hydroxyl radicals which may completely mineralize adsorbed organic compounds. The extent of degradation must be carefully monitored through TOC and COD analyses. Quantifying the intermediates formed from catalytic ozonation through appropriate analytical techniques will aid in developing accurate degradation pathways and estimation of associated kinetic constants. There is considerable scope for optimizing the combined heterogeneous catalytic ozonation process by adjusting the material surface properties, composition, and operating conditions such as pH, initial concentration of pollutants, ozone dosage, and catalyst dosage. In addition to degradation efficiency, the sustainability of the supported catalysts must be tested for their stability and reusability. The investigated pollutant system may include model pollutants and synthetic and real industrial wastes to identify suitable metal/metal-oxide catalysts for the targeted class of pollutants and optimize process operations.

The SDGs include the reduction of waste by minimizing the discharge of hazardous chemicals into water resources, as well as recycling and reuse. Incomplete treatment of wastewater may reduce primary pollutants but produce significant amounts of toxic intermediates. Ozonation, a promising wastewater treatment option, directly contributes to oxidizing of double bonds and the destruction of aromatic rings of the primary organic pollutant. However, intermediates such as aldehydes, ketones, and acids accumulate, and complete mineralization is not achieved. Ozonation may be intensified with heterogeneous catalysis for sustained generation of nonspecific oxidants, namely, hydroxyl radicals which may completely mineralize adsorbed organic compounds. The extent of degradation must be carefully monitored through TOC and COD analyses. Quantifying the intermediates formed from catalytic ozonation through appropriate analytical techniques will aid in developing accurate degradation pathways and estimation of associated kinetic constants. There is considerable scope for optimizing the combined heterogeneous catalytic ozonation process by adjusting the material surface properties, composition, and operating conditions such as pH, initial concentration of pollutants, ozone dosage, and catalyst dosage. In addition to degradation efficiency, the sustainability of the supported catalysts must be tested for their stability and reusability. The investigated pollutant system may include model pollutants and synthetic and real industrial wastes to identify suitable metal/metal-oxide catalysts for the targeted class of pollutants and optimize process operations.   Keywords Sustainable development goal  toxic intermediates  catalytic ozonation  hydroxyl radicals  stability of catalyst  reusability   11.1 Introduction  Water is indistinguishably linked to the social and economic development of all nations. The global water demand has been increasing due to population growth, urbanization, and requirements from agriculture, industry, and the energy sector. This rapid growth in demand over the next two decades will cause an acute shortage of safe drinking water in various parts of the world.1   The rapid increase in the urban population from 30% in 1950 to 55% in 2018 increased water demand.2   The global population is likely to increase from 7.7 billion in 2018 to between 9.4 and 10.2 billion by 2050, and it was projected that around 67% of the global population will be concentrated in urban cities leading to more water consumption.3   Water scarcity affected more than 40% of the worldâs population and is likely to become even more severe in the coming years.4   By 2030, the global safe water drinking demand is expected to increase by 50%. Therefore the United Nations listed âclean water and sanitationâ as one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).5   11.1.1 Sustainable development goals for 2030 In 2015, member countries of the United Nations agreed on the Sustainable Development agenda for the welfare of the planet earth and  its inhabitants, which should be achieved by 2030.6   This agenda includes 17 SDGs with total targets numbering 169 that should be achieved by 2030. One of these SDGs emphasizes clean drinking water and sanitation and aims to âensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for allâ by 2030.7   The main targets of this SDG are given in Table 11.1  .  11.1.2 Effect of toxic water-borne pollutants on the environment and humans Water sources such as natural springs, lakes, rivers, and wells were widely used for domestic purposes such as irrigation, transportation, producing electricity through hydroelectric dams, and leisure activities. Approximately 70% of all water abstracted from these sources is used for irrigation in agriculture. These water sources often get polluted due to the indiscriminate discharge of human waste and industrial effluents, decreasing water quality.4   Almost 80% of wastewater from different human activities is dumped into lakes and rivers without treatment.9â11   Based on the surveys on drinking water quality from the U.S. environmental protection agency, half of the rivers and almost 1/3rd of the lakes are polluted due to the direct discharge of wastewater.12   Pollution from  various industries such as textile, pharmaceutical, and chemical has drawn considerable attention due to its harmful effects on human health, the environment, and vegetation.10,13   Dyes are used extensively in different industries such as textile, paper, construction, paints, leather, and food, among many others.14   Dyes have complex aromatic structures making them more stable and difficult to biodegrade.15   According to Market Report and Forecast, the dyes and pigments market in India is 133.52 million tons in 2020 and is expected to grow by 11% from 2022 to 2026 due to increasing population, rising demand for cosmetics, paints, and coatings, and the rising globalization and urbanization.16   Similarly, phenolic compounds are considered one of the most hazardous pollutants in wastewater because of their very high toxicity.17   Phenol, 4-nitrophenol, aminophenol, chlorophenol, and others are widely used in industries as intermediates for the synthesis of dyes, cosmetic products, fungicides, plastics, disinfectants, and drugs such as paracetamol, phenetidine, and acetophenetidin. The water containing these compounds could cause damage to the liver and kidneys in humans and poses serious problems to the environment due to their poor biodegradability and very high biotoxicity effects.18,19   According to WHO, approximately 0.8 million people are projected to die yearly because of diarrhea from contaminated water.20   According to WHO, in 2017, around 220 million people were treated with schistosomiasis caused by drinking polluted water.20   Hence, the wastewater discharged from various industries containing organic and inorganic compounds needs to be treated using a suitable process to mitigate the damage to the environment and human health.  11.1.3 Wastewater treatment processes, their advantages, and limitations Several treatment methods have been adopted for treating wastewater. The features of these methods are summarized in Table 11.2  . Each treatment process may be differentiated based on its performance, cost-effectiveness, feasibility, reliability, operation difficulty, environmental impact, and the formation of possibly toxic by-products.21   The selection of the wastewater treatment process to be used for the pollutant removal will thus depend on the wastewaterâs characteristics. Nowadays, there is no single method capable of suitable treatment of industrial wastewater, mainly due to the presence of multiple pollutants in industrial effluents.21,22   Therefore the combination of two or more treatment methods is often used for the removal of organic and inorganic pollutants most economically.    In this work, we consolidate and highlight the combined treatment involving catalytic ozonation, a technology that has made rapid strides. In this chapter, we emphasize both understanding of the key mechanistic features and the practical implementation of the catalytic ozonation techniques. Model pollutants involving dyes and phenolic compounds are chosen to demonstrate the key features of the chosen technology.   11.2 Ozonation and its limitations 11.2.1 Ozone as an oxidant Ozone is a very powerful oxidizing agent. It is five times more oxidizing than oxygen and about twice as oxidizing as chlorine. The standard reduction potential of ozone is 2.07 eV.25   Ozone-based processes have been receiving serious consideration recently in wastewater treatment because of ozoneâs disinfection capabilities, and its degradation properties26   Ozone disinfects water by ensuring cell lysis of microorganisms and oxidizes their proteins, enzymes, and DNA. Ozone enters the wastewater at the pretreatment and intermediate oxidation stages. At the first entry point, it eliminates inorganic compounds, turbidity, color, and suspended solids.27   Inorganic compounds such as iron and manganese are removed through ozone by converting them to ferric hydroxide that precipitates out and manganese (IV) oxide, which is insoluble28   Here, natural organic matter is partially degraded, and microorganisms get inactivated. At the intermediate oxidation step, the micropollutants are degraded, and the biodegradability of the treated waste gets enhanced.28   The structure of ozone is given in Fig. 11.1  .29   The two forms of ozone arise due to resonance. Due to its structure, ozone may act as a nucleophile or electrophile when participating in reactions in the aqueous solutions.29   As an electrophile, ozone may attack the organics at their nucleophilic position and substitute one part of the organic molecule.   11.2.2 Limitations of ozone Ozone suffers from the drawback of being rather selective and slow in its oxidation of pollutants.29   For example, ozone may not oxidize deactivated aromatics rapidly, that is, when the aromatic ring has less electron density due to electrons withdrawal from the ring. The hydrogen substitution reaction will be directed by the deactivating groups (e.g.,: âNO2 , âCHO, âCOOH) to the metaposition while activating groups (e.g.,: âOH, âNH2 , âNHR) will direct to the ortho and para positions.25   Ozonation processes are rather expensive, requiring high purity oxygen supply or oxygen concentrator and ozone generator. Ozone has a short lifetime and poor solubility in water leading to low utilization, and further, it does not completely mineralize the organic compounds.30   The intermediates produced are still present in the aqueous solution and contribute to the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD). Even TOC is not significantly reduced in raw water treatment as only a very small part of the oxidation reactions result in CO2  formation.28   To ameliorate the above shortcomings, ozone treatment is combined with other processes, including ultraviolet irradiation, hydrogen peroxide, and biological treatment. Heterogeneous catalytic ozonation has gained attention since the 1990s.25   We present the essential mechanistic features of catalytic ozonation, its applications, detection of intermediates produced, and typical reaction pathways.   11.3 Catalytic ozonation To utilize ozone in a better manner, catalytic ozonation has been proposed, wherein the ozone molecules are decomposed into hydroxyl radicals. In 1972 Hewes and Davison exhibited that the removal of TOC and COD in municipal wastewater by ozonation may be enhanced by deploying transition metal ions (e.g., Co2+ , Ti2+ , and Mn2+ ) as a catalyst.25   The unpaired electrons in the hydroxyl radicals make them very active. These radicals are more potent, have a higher reduction potential (2.80 eV) when compared to ozone, are nonspecific towards the nature of the pollutant, and achieve a higher reduction in COD. In recent times, heterogeneous catalytic ozonation has been preferred over homogeneous one, as it is difficult to remove the soluble metal catalyst from the aqueous solutions,31   leading to potential secondary pollution. The sequence of steps involved during the decomposition of ozone are represented by the following equations.28,32   The first step generates the hydroxyl radical by oxidizing water.(11.1) O  3   + H  2   O â 2 H O  â¢   + O  2        The next step generates the hydroperoxyl radical HO2 â¢   which is also a reactive oxygen species, and the superoxide ion radical(11.2) O  3   + O H  â    â H O  2  â¢   + O  2  â¢    â       Ozone and hydroxyl radicals react to form the superoxide ion radical, which is in equilibrium with molecular O2  and hydroperoxyl radical [Eq. (11.3) ](11.3) O  3   + H O  â¢   â O  2   + H O  2  â¢   â O  2  â¢    â   + H  +       Further generation of hydroxyl radicals occurs through the following reaction [Eq. (11.4) ](11.4) O  3   + H O  2  â¢   â 2 O  2   + H O  â¢       Finally, hydrogen peroxide is produced by the following reaction.(11.5) O  2   + H O  2  â¢   â H  2   O  2   + O  2       However, hydroxyl radicals may be mopped up by scavengers, as shown by the following reactions.25  (11.6) H O  â¢   + O  3   â O  2   + H O  2  â¢      (11.7) H O  â¢   + HC O  3  â    â O H  â   + HC O  3  â¢      (11.8) H O  â¢   + C O  3  2 â   â O H  â   + C O  3  â â¢      (11.9) H O  â¢   + H  2   P O  4  â   â O H  â   + H  2   P O  4  â¢      (11.10) H O  .   + HP O  4  2 â   â O H  â   + HP O  4  â       To efficiently decompose ozone, a wide variety of catalysts are deployed. These include carbon materials (graphene, activated carbon, carbon nanotubes), metal oxides (Al2 O3 , TiO2 , Fe2 O3 , FeOOH, MnO2 ), metals or metal oxides on supports such as activated carbon, Al2 O3 , CeO2 , TiO2 , silica, zeolites, and carbon nanotubes.33,34   Additional examples of catalyst configurations are copper supported on alumina, ruthenium on ceria, vanadium oxide on silica gel, and titania on alumina. Doped metal oxides involve metal dopants such as Mn, Zr, and Ce. It may be seen from the list of catalysts and their supports given above that metal oxides play an important role in catalytic ozonation, either as supports or as catalysts. The properties of the metal oxide surfaces play an important role during the various steps of catalytic ozonation and are discussed in the next section.  11.3.1 Role of hydroxyl groups on metal oxide surfaces Hydroxyl groups present on the adsorbent surfaces play an important role in determining the nature and strength of the adsorption of organic pollutants.31   Adsorption has a bearing on the catalytic ozonation performance as well. The crystalline metal oxides have a regular charge-compensating arrangement of oxygen (negative) and metal (positive) atoms in the interior of the solid.35   However, this regular structure is disturbed at the surface, and charge imbalances are created. The positive metal ion present free of surrounding oxygen will be neutralized by O H  â     ion, while the coordinatively unsaturated oxygen anion will combine with a proton, leading to OH groups on the surface in both instances. These OH groups attached to the solid surface are represented by â¡SâOH. The nature of the OH groups on the solid surface, that is, protonated (â¡SâOH2 + ) under acidic conditions, normal (â¡SâOH) and deprotonated (â¡SâOâ ) under basic conditions will influence the ozone decomposition and the hydroxyl radical generation. The existence of the different anionic and cationic species may be represented by Eqs. (11.11) and (11.12) .(11.11) â¡ S â OH + H  +   â â¡ S â O H  2  +       If the intrinsic ionization constant for the above reaction is K1 , -log10 K1  is represented by pK1 . Similarly, underbasic conditions, we have the intrinsic ionization constant expressed in terms of pK2  for the following reaction(11.12) â¡ S â OH + O H  â   â â¡ S â O  â   + H  2   O     It may be seen that the solid surface is negatively charged at alkaline pH and positively charged at acidic pH. The net charge on the solid surface is zero at an intermediate pH termed as the point of zero charge (pHPZC ). The pHPZC  is defined according to Eq. (11.13) .(11.13) pH  PZC   = 1  2   ( p K  1   + p K  2   )     The fraction of deprotonated species â¡SâOâ  increases beyond pK1 , and the fraction of the protonated species â¡SâOH2 +  increases below pK2 . In between pK1  and pK2 , the amount of â¡SâOH remains nearly constant. The amount and properties of the hydroxide groups depend upon the choice of metal oxides.33   At pH below pHPZC , the solid acts as an anionic exchanger; at pH above pHPZC , it acts as a cationic exchanger.  The adsorption of different species on the surface of the metal oxides may be through the formation of inner and outer sphere complexes, respectively. In the inner sphere complexes, the adsorptive ions are without surrounding water molecules and are directly and strongly bound to the surface sites by ligand exchange.35   Either one or two surface sites may be involved in the ligand exchange. In the outer sphere complexes, the ions are surrounded by water molecules. The ionic species are weakly bound to the surface sites of the solid, with water molecules still present between the ion and the solid surface. Hence the bond lengths are more, and the binding is weak. In the degradation of p-chlorobenzoic acid (PCB), the PCB is first adsorbed on the ferric oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) surface through the formation of an outer sphere complex.32   A hydrogen bond may be formed between the solid oxide surface and the organic pollutant. The adsorbed species may be mineralized by H O  .    , which is generated from ozone on the catalyst surface. These steps under acidic conditions are given in Eqs. (11.14) and (11.15) .(11.14) â¡ FeO H  2  +   + RCOOH â â¡ FeO H  2  +   â â HOOCR    (11.15) â¡ FeO H  2  +   â â HOOCR + H O  .   â Products     Even the organic species may be ionized in the presence of surface hydroxyl groups [Eq. (11.16) ] and may be converted to organic radicals [Eq. (11.17) ] upon exposure to ozone.32  (11.16) â¡ FeOH + RCOOH â Fe O  â   + RCO O  â   + H  2   O    (11.17) RCO O  â   + O  3   â R  â¢       The organic radicals may be broken down upon further reaction with ozone. Next, we focus on typical catalyst systems and outline the mechanisms proposed for catalytic ozonation reactions.   11.4 Mechanisms of catalytic ozonation using typical catalyst systems 11.4.1 Iron-based catalysts These are widely used owing to their availability, sparing solubility in water, easy synthesis, and relatively less toxicity.33,36   Iron (III) oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) is a popular catalyst as it contains many hydroxyl groups. It is well-known that these groups play a very important role in the adsorption of organic pollutants and their subsequent ozonation.37,38   Sui et al.31   chose oxalic acid as the model pollutant as it was refractory  to ozone attack and was detected as an intermediate in several ozonation studies. Further, it exhibited pH-sensitive ionization, which enables it to be adsorbed on FeOOH catalyst under acidic and neutral conditions.31   Basic conditions were not considered as the authors found ozone to self-decompose, and adsorption of phosphate ions blocked the active sites of the FeOOH catalyst. Catalytic ozonation improved the degradation of oxalic acid by six times at acidic pH and by 2.5 times at neutral pH conditions. TOC correlated with residual oxalic acid in solution indicated that other organic intermediates were completely mineralized. When referring to adsorption by FeOOH and only ozonation, Sui et al.31   found that catalytic ozonation provided a synergistic effect to the extent of about 21%. There appears to be some debate in the literature on the role of pH in catalytic ozonation. This is discussed next. The protonation of OH groups at low pH [Eq. (11.11) ] was considered unfavorable for ozone decomposition due to the reduced nucleophilic nature of the oxygen in the OH2 +  group. However, even in acidic conditions, it was felt that hydroxyl radicals might be generated through the ozone. It was felt that the electron-rich oxygen in the ozoneâs resonance structure (Fig. 11.1 ) might act as a Lewis base to react with the Bronsted acid site, namely, the OH2 +  group. Eqs (11.18â11.20)  show the proposed mechanism under acidic conditions.31  (11.18) O  3   + Fe â O H  2  +   â Fe â O H  â¢    +   + H O  3  â¢      (11.19) H O  3  â¢   â H O  â¢   + O  2      (11.20) Fe â O H  â¢ +   + H  2   O â Fe â O H  2  +   + H O  â¢       When the hydroxyl group was not protonated, it could still generate hydroxyl radicals through steps represented by Eqs. (11.21â11.23) .(11.21) 2 O  3   + Fe â OH â Fe â O  2  â¢ â   + H O  3  â¢   + O  2      (11.22) H O  3  â¢   â H O  â¢   + O  2      (11.23) Fe â O  2  â¢ â   + O  3   + H  2   O â Fe â OH + O  2   + H O  3  â¢       The hydrogen trioxy radical contributes to hydroxyl radical formation at both pH conditions.  11.4.2 Cerium-doped iron catalyst The versatility of innovative catalytic ozonation has been demonstrated.39,40   Cerium was doped into FeOOH to yield the material with the formula Ce0.1 Fe0.9 OOH which was used to degrade sulfamethazine (SMT). Composite iron oxides are rich in hydroxyl groups on the surface and possess oxygen vacancies. These refer to missing oxygen atoms  in the lattice structure and are known as point defects. The effect of pH was explained in detail by these authors. The pHPZC  was 7.8 for the composite catalyst, and the efficacy of catalytic ozonation was high at acidic and neutral pH conditions. Catalytic ozonation was about 20% greater than single ozonation underacidic conditions. The second pKA  of SMT was around seven, after which it existed in an anionic form. This enhanced the electrostatic attraction of SMT to the positively charged catalyst surface at pH above this pKA  and below the solidâs pHPZC . Above this pHPZC , the negatively charged adsorbent will repel the SMT anion. Hence adsorption of the pollutant, an important preliminary step in catalytic ozonation, is successfully accomplished at low and neutral pH. Bai et al.39   explained that the self-decomposition of ozone is inhibited at low pH, and it is the enhanced electron transfer between the water and Ce-doped FeOOH catalyst that is responsible for the generation of H O  .     from ozone. The adsorbed ozone forms a five-sided ring structure and decomposes on the catalyst surface, liberating hydroxyl radicals that nonspecifically attack the pollutant SMT in solution. The redox recycling involving Fe2+ /Fe3+  and Ce3+ /Ce4+  leads to one-electron transfer and aids in the generation of hydroxyl radicals.39    11.4.3 Activated carbon-based catalysts Conventionally activated carbons (AC) are more known for their adsorption prowess.41,42   However, they may also be used as catalysts, and the catalytic property may be enhanced by the impregnation of iron catalysts in their matrix. The effect of different proportions of iron in activated carbon on catalytic ozonation of dibutyl phosphate (DBP) was investigated.43   The presence of iron reduced the key adsorbent parameters such as BET surface area, pore diameter, and pore volume, especially at 30% loading. An iron content of 15%, with minimal blocking of the pores and a pH of 8, was found ideal for maximum DBP removal. Huang et al.43   found that the reduction in adsorbent parameters due to increased iron loadings did not significantly affect DBPâs adsorption. Increased iron loadings led to enhanced agglomeration of the iron particles on the activated carbon surface, thereby reducing the density of the active sites and weakening their catalytic properties. The reaction mechanism is explained in detail in the following sections. There are both acidic and basic groups in the activated carbon. The acidic groups may be neutralized or exchanged with basic groups to enhance the carbonâs basicity and prevent the acid groups from overshadowing the basic properties. The delocalized Ï electrons are located  on the basal planes forming the graphitic layers of activated carbon and located away from the crystallite edges. In addition to resonating electrons of carbon aromatic rings, the activated carbonâs basicity may stem from entities such as chromene, pyrones, and nitrogen-containing groups. These play an important role when activated carbon is subject to ozonation. These act as Lewis bases to form electron donor-acceptor complexes with water.43,44  (11.24) â C Ï + 2 H  2   O â C Ï â H  3   O  +   + O H  â       The electron-rich regions also promote the following reaction, leading to hydroxyl ions.(11.25) O  3   + H  2   O + 2 e  â   â O  2   + 2 O H  â       The chromene and pyrone basic groups react with ozone under acidic conditions to form hydrogen peroxide.44      Both O H  â     and H  2   O  2     are precursors for chain reactions leading to hydroxyl radical formation from the breakdown of ozone. Hence the adsorption capabilities and catalytic activity of activated carbons provide synergy with ozonation to enable rapid mineralization of organic pollutants. Further improvement may be had from the iron particles, which provide additional active sites. Many scavengers are present in aqueous solutions that mop up the free radicals and reduce the degradation rates. However, while direct ozonation suffered considerably from free radical scavengers, there was a relatively lesser effect when iron-loaded AC was used as a catalyst in ozonation.43   An optimum pH for DBP removal was eight, which was close to 8.5, the pHPZC  of the iron-loaded catalyst. Hence the solid surface would be nearly neutral. Interesting events are in play when the solution is either strongly acidic or basic. Under highly acidic conditions, the OH group on the solid surface becomes protonated [Eq. (11.11) ]. Consequently, the oxygen atomâs nucleophilic character decreases, and so does its interaction with ozone. Under basic conditions, the proton in the OH group becomes less electrophilic as it is released into the solution [Eq. (11.12) ], and interaction with ozone declines. Huang et al.43   also discussed the  role played by the iron oxide (goethite) loaded on activated carbon. The DBP was adsorbed on the metal and degraded by concentrated ozone present there and by hydroxyl radicals generated in situ through ozone decomposition. Further, the liberated hydroxyl radicals diffused into the aqueous solution and oxidized the dissolved DBP. The reactions involving the metal oxide and ozone are given by Eqs. (11.26â11.28) .(11.26) FeOOH + O  3   â FeOH ( O  3   )    (11.27) FeOH ( O  3   ) â Fe ( O ) OH + O  2      (11.28) Fe O    OH + O  3   + H  2   O â FeOH + H O  â¢   + O  2  â â¢   + O  2   + H  +        11.4.4 Addition of Mn and/or Fe on granular activated carbon The use of Mn and Fe metal oxides in catalytic ozonation of phenol has been advocated owing to their ready availability and variable oxidation states (Mn: â3 to +7, Fe: usually 0, +2, and +3 but +4 to +6 are also known) contributing to vigorous electron transfer through redox cycling and generation of mobile electrons.18   These reactions are known to generate hydroxyl radicals. Xiong et al.18   proposed that a mixture of Fe and Mn may have an even better effect on the catalytic ozonation. These authors took care to verify whether the Fe and Mn leached out from the catalyst through ICP-OES studies. Ozonation with either granular activated carbon (GAC) or with the supported metal oxide catalysts could completely degrade phenol within 25 minutes, while direct ozonation could only accomplish the degradation to the extent of 89% within the same time. The TOC reductions were 32% for direct ozonation, 47% from GAC alone due to adsorption and slight catalytic action, 56% for Fe/GAC, 60% for Fe-Mn/GAC, and eventually a high 70% for Mn/GAC in 90 minutes. Two things stand out here, namely, the rather long time for expensive ozonation and the relatively less-than-anticipated performance for TOC reduction with catalytic ozonation using different metal oxide/GAC systems. There appears to be considerable scope for optimization involving the mixture compositions and process variable settings. The authors ascribed the decreasing performance at higher loading of metal oxides (>0.1 M) due to pore blockage. The chief aspects of the mechanism suggested are given next.18   As seen above, the redox recycling involving Fe2+ -  Fe3+  and Mn2+ -Mn3+ -Mn4+  was responsible for the generation of OHâ¢  .25   The redox couples (M=Mn/Fe) are represented next.18  (11.29) â¡ M  n + 1   + O  3   â â¡ M  n +   + H O  â¢   + H O  2  â¢   + O  2      (11.30) â¡ M  n +   + O  3   + H  +   â â¡ M  n + 1   + H O  â¢   + O  2        The redox recycling was established by CVV measurements. While GAC alone revealed insignificant redox current, Mn/GAC showed the highest current signal, followed by Fe-Mn/GAC and Fe/GAC. This tracks the order of mineralization efficiency of phenol by the different catalysts. Unexpectedly, synergy was not observed for the Mn-Fe combination on GAC. This was attributed to the magnetite and MnO2  forming a galvanic corrosion current couple, facilitating the dissolution and release of Fe2+  and Mn2+  ions into the solution under neutral pH conditions. The reaction mechanism involving direct ozonation and hydroxyl attack after ozone decomposition, along with galvanic corrosion, is illustrated in Fig. 11.2  .  11.4.5 Manganese oxide supported on alumina The catalytic ozonation of different pharmaceutical compounds using manganese oxide dispersed on mesoporous and nonporous alumina has been studied.45   Changes at the surface were monitored using FTIR (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, and the spectra is given in Fig. 11.3  . Phenazone was degraded in the presence of mesoporous alumina alone, indicating that even the support material enjoyed   catalytic properties. The point of zero charge for mesoporous alumina was more than eight, which led to higher ligand exchange capability. Adding manganese oxide augmented the degradation efficiency of phenazone. Lewis acid sites on the alumina surface played an important role in adsorbing Lewis bases such as water and ozone. When exposed to ozone after complete drying, the fresh catalyst surface revealed a distinct peak at 1380 cmâ1 , and the intensity of the peak correlated well with the catalytic activity in degrading the pharmaceutical pollutant. For instance, mesoporous alumina performed better than nonporous alumina, and the new peak was very distinct in the former. This peak suggested the formation of surface oxide on the Lewis acid site of the alumina, and water inhibited this formation. In addition, the hydroxyl peak at 3497 cmâ1  was enhanced, suggesting that fresh OH groups were formed. These groups may have formed from the interaction of surface oxide species and the water molecules. Interestingly, after introducing phenazone, the peak at 1380 cmâ1  decreased for all catalyst combinations, while the hydroxyl group intensities at 3497 cmâ1  decreased only for the MnOx  -supporting catalysts. This led to strong conclusions that while the surface oxides were centers for pollutant degradation for all catalysts, the hydroxyl groups became active centers for pollutant degradation in the presence of MnOx  .45    11.4.6 Mixed metal oxide catalysts In addition to the usual configurations involving metal oxide catalysts (e.g., FeOOH, TiO2 , CeO2 , MnO2 , Co3 O4 , V2 O5 ) and transition metals (Mn, Mg, Cu, Ni) on supports (e.g., AC, Al2 O3 , graphene, carbon nanotubes), the idea of mixed metal oxide catalysts has gained attention in recent times.46   Spinel ferrites with a general formula MFe2 O4  (M=Mn, Cu, Ni, Co, Zn, Mg, etc.) include a combination of two metals and have been widely used as a catalyst in catalytic ozonation due to their stable structure, high oxygen vacancies, and high density of surface hydroxyl groups that serve as active sites.39   Copper ferrite (CuFe2 O4 ) and bismuth copper oxide (Bi2 CuO4 ) have been used in the catalytic ozonation of organics, including dyes. A novel magnetic porous ferrospinel NiFe2 O4  is used in the catalytic ozonation of the di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP)46   with the objective of elucidating the reaction mechanism involving ozone at the solid-liquid interface. FTIR results revealed the importance of surface hydroxyl groups as active sites in facilitating the H O  â¢     generation. The redox recycle reaction pathways involved the oxidation  of Ni2+  to Ni3+ , and the released electron caused the ozoneâs decomposition into hydroxyl radicals. Ni2+  was regenerated by the oxidation of the lattice oxygen O2â . Almost 100% degradation of DBP could be achieved. Only ozonation was preferred at higher pH conditions where the excess O H  â     led to more O  3     decomposition, which in turn eventually formed hydroxyl radicals as given in Eqs. (11.31â11.33) .(11.31) O  3   + O H  â   â H O  2  â   + O  2      (11.32) O  3   + H O  2  â   â H O  â¢   + O  2  â¢ â   + O  2      (11.33) O  3   + O  2  â¢ â   â O  3  â¢ â   + O  2       The pHPZC  of the catalyst was 7.7. Ren et al.46   attributed the catalytic ozonation enhancement below pH 7.7 to the generation of more H O  â¢    . At pH < pHpzc, the surface of the catalyst became protonated and positively charged, which increased the liberation of OH  â     ions in the bulk solution. Furthermore, the liberated OH  â     ions could accelerate ozone decomposition to produce more H O  â¢     [Eqs. (11.31) and (11.32) ] during the oxidation process. Whereas, at pH beyond the pHPZC , the catalystâs surface got deprotonated and became negatively charged. Due to the liberation of H  +     ions at higher pH (>pHpzc), the catalytic ozonation showed a marked decrease. Maximum degradation could be achieved at a pH of 7.7 when the hydroxide concentration was maximum on the uncharged surface. Using the tert-butyl alcohol, a free radical scavenger, the catalytic ozonation rates were considerably suppressed, which vindicated the hydroxyl radical-based mineralization. Further, the addition of phosphate inhibited degradation as this base underwent ligand exchange with the hydroxyl group on the catalyst surface. Hence, it could be inferred that hydroxyl groups constituted the active sites on the catalyst surface. After exposing the NiFe2 O4  catalyst to ozonation and phosphate solution and drying, the samples were analyzed with FTIR. The FTIR of the original NiFe2 O4  exhibited a peak at 3392 cmâ1  suggesting hydroxyl groups bonded to the surface. After ozonation and drying, the spectra showed a distinct peak at 1383 cmâ1  indicating the formation of a surface oxide due to the ozone reaction with the OH active site. Upon treatment with PO4 2â  solution, this peak disappeared, indicating the phosphate replaced the OH groups and inhibited the latterâs combination with ozone for producing the metal oxide site. XPS peaks indicated that Fe2+  ions were not present along with Fe3+ , with the absence of the former indicating that Fe3+  did not participate in the electron transfer reduction reaction. However, Ni was present in both the +2 and +3 valence states before and after ozonation, with Ni3+  presence increasing after the ozonation. Ni2+  content dominated before ozonation. This indicates the oxidation of Ni2+  during the ozonation process.  The oxygen peaks also had important information. Two peaks characterizing lattice oxygen (O2â ) and adsorbed OH groups changed content before and after catalytic ozonation, thereby confirming their role as active sites in the reactions. The hydroxyl concentration increased while O2â  decreased after catalytic ozonation. These observations are based on XPS spectra, as shown in Fig. 11.4  . Lattice oxygen content was reduced due to it being oxidized to O2  by Ni3+ .

In this table, the experimental conditions and treatment summary are summarized. The catalysts may be divided into three categories, namely, metal oxides (Fe2 O3 , FeOOH, MnO2 , CeO2 , ZnO, MgO, etc.), activated carbon (AC), and metal oxides supported on AC (CeO2 /AC, FeOOH/AC, MnO2 /AC, MgO/AC, ZnO/AC, etc.). These were used to degrade different organic compounds present in an aqueous solution effectively.   11.5 Identification of reaction pathways for intermediates oxidation The organic pollutants oxidize through ozonation via two routes â direct and/or indirect oxidation.55   In direct oxidation, ozone directly breakdown the unsaturated bonds and chromophore groups in organic pollutants. Indirect oxidation is mainly through the decomposition of ozone and the formation of the HO  â¢     which oxidizes the organic pollutants. The reaction mechanism for the generation of HO  â¢     through the decomposition of ozone is given by Eqs. (11.31) and (11.32) .56   As the decomposition of ozone into HO  â¢     is initiated by the O H  â     [Eq. (11.31) ], the pH of the solution plays a significant role.57   The stability of the ozone molecule is poor under alkaline conditions, which results in the formation of more HO  â¢     and the oxidation of organic compounds is dominated by this radical. However, the oxidation of different organic pollutants is controlled by ozone under acidic conditions.25   The complete oxidation of organic compounds by ozonation alone is very difficult because it generates recalcitrant intermediates.18   These are still present in the aqueous solution, thereby contributing to the high COD.58      11.5.1 Intermediates analysis Identifying and quantifying the intermediates generated during the ozonation process is essential to propose degradation pathways for organic compounds.59   The formation of intermediates during ozonation depends on the solutionâs pH. The formation of intermediates from the breakdown of phenolic compounds has been extensively studied.58,60,61   Individual batch studies with 4-chlorophenol (4CP) and 4-nitrophenol (4NP) were used to identify intermediates.58   Catechol was a primary breakdown product for both these pollutants at different initial pH. Hydroquinone was identified as a degradation intermediate from ozonation of 4CP only. Hydroxylation was the major degradation pathway for both compounds. The 4-chloro and 4-nitrocatechol were further identified during the ozonation of both compounds. Hydroxylation with dechlorination due to hydroxyl radical was the major route for the degradation of 4-chlorophenol. 2,4-dinitrophenol, and 3,6-dinitrocatechol were other novel intermediates identified during the ozonation process. The intermediates identified during the ozonation process were 4-chlorocatechol (pH=10), 4-chloro-1,3-dihydroxybenzene (pH=10), trans-muconic acid (pH=3), 2,3-dihydroxybenzoquinone (pH=3), 2,6-dihydroxybenzoquinone (pH=3), 2,4-dinitrophenol (pH=10), 4-nitrocatechol (at all pH), and 5,5-dinitro-2,2-biphenyldiol (pH=10). Other C5 , C4  & C3  compounds after ring opening were also identified.58   Therefore the oxidation of compounds via direct ozone and HO  â¢     attack plays a significant role in the degradation and of mineralization pathways. Typical studies on the identification of the reaction intermediates of the phenolic compounds by the ozonation process are and summarized in Table 11.4  .  11.5.2 Degradation pathways Degradation pathways provide insights into the different routes for the oxidation of primary organic compounds using O3  and/or HO  â¢    . Different possible degradation pathways have been proposed for various phenolic compounds based on the intermediate identified using GCâMS and HPLC. A degradation pathway for the catalytic ozonation of phenol involving Fe/Mn-supported GAC has been proposed.18   The direct oxidation by O3  was explained via the Criegee mechanism for aromatic and aliphatic compounds, whereas the hydroxyl radicals were used to cleave benzene rings and unsaturated bonds through indirect oxidation. The proposed degradation pathways of phenol by catalytic ozonation are given in Fig. 11.5  . The analysis revealed that the hydroxylation of the aromatic compounds was the major route for forming the primary intermediates such   as benzoquinone, catechol, hydroquinone, and resorcinol. Further, the dihydroxybenzenes were oxidized via hydroxylation to form trihydroxy benzenes and reduced to form benzoquinones simultaneously. The aromatic compounds were decomposed via benzene ring cleavage and consequent ring opening. After ring-opening, the compounds were then oxidized to end products such as oxalic and acetic acids. Finally, the aliphatic compounds were completely oxidized and mineralized to CO2  and H2 O.18   A similar study on phenol degradation by ozonation combined with activated carbon was carried out to understand the degradation mechanism.19   The analysis revealed that phenol was first oxidized by the active species (O3  or H O  â¢    ) to form the primary intermediates such as hydroquinone and catechol. The hydroxylated intermediate products, formed during the oxidation of phenol, would lose hydrogen ions and electrons to form quinones. After that, the aromatic rings of intermediate compounds were and oxidized further to form muconic acid at acidic conditions (pH=3) via the Criegee mechanism. Finally, the smaller acidic compounds were oxidized and completely mineralized to CO2  and H2 O. Mei et al.63   proposed a degradation pathway for the p-nitrophenol (PNP) oxidized by O3 , H O  â¢    , and other free radicals. It was reported that hydroxylation was the major degradation route for PNP. The reaction rate constants for hydroxylation reactions of PNP through H O  â¢     and  H O  2  â¢     in the aqueous medium were 1.08 Ã 10  9     and 2.28 Ã 10  â 8    M  â 1   s  â 1     respectively. Hence, the reaction of PNP with hydroxyl radicals was very fast compared to other radicals. Further analysis revealed primary degradation intermediates such as benzoquinone, hydroquinone, and 4-nitrobenzene-1,2-diol, which were identified using GCâMS and HPLC. These three intermediates further reacted with H O  â¢     and their respective reaction rate constants were estimated as 2.13 Ã 10  9    , 6.91 Ã 10  9    , and 6.99 Ã 10  9    M  â 1   s  â 1    . Other studies on the degradation of PNP and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) using mesoporous Mn-Co-Fe and Fe/AC in catalytic ozonation were proposed by Ma and Zhu64   and Huang et al.43   The main degradation process was summarized in three steps, (1) direct oxidation of a primary compound by O3  in the aqueous phase, (2) Pollutants were adsorbed on the catalyst surface to react with O3 , and highly oxidative H O  â¢    , (3) Free radicals formed on the catalyst surface diffused into bulk solution and reacted with the organic compounds. The primary compounds PNP and DBP were completely decomposed by ozone alone, but their degradation intermediates were not. The analysis revealed that oxalic acid was the main intermediate formed and accumulated during the catalytic ozonation of PNP. It has been reported that oxalic acid was hardly oxidized by O  3     molecules but rapidly oxidized by H O  â¢     with the reaction rate constant of 1.4 Ã 10  6    M  â 1    s  â 1    . The removal of oxalic acid in the presence of ozone alone was only 52%, but it has been significantly increased to 78% with the addition of MnâCoâFe43   reported the kinetic rate constants for the reactions of DBP with O3  and H O  â¢     as 0.092 and 4.64 Ã 10  9   M  â 1    s  â 1    , respectively. Hence, the degradation of DBP is very slow by molecular ozone but very rapid when hydroxyl radicals are present. It may be seen from the above sections that to understand the catalytic mechanism, it is essential to understand the physicochemical properties of the catalyst before and after ozonation. Further, we briefly describe analytical instruments and techniques used to detect reaction intermediates and reactive oxidation species (ROS) encountered when developing degradation pathways.  11.5.3 Identification of primary reactive oxidation species The identification and quantification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydroxyl radicals (O H  â¢    ), superoxide radicals (O  2  â¢ â    ), and hydroperoxy radicals (H O  2  â¢    ) in catalytic ozonation are crucial for understanding the degradation and mineralization pathways of recalcitrant organic pollutants. The ROS are highly reactive with a very short lifetime, thus making it very difficult to detect them directly.65   Several methods have been proposed to  identify ROS. Among them, electron spin resonance (ESR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and quenching experiments are the most widely used methods.65,66   ESR was originally introduced to investigate magnetic matters such as transition metal ions and radicals, which contain more than one unpaired electron.67   Later, EPR was established to advance the performance of ESR further. The ESR and EPR methods were used effectively to detect hydroxyl radicals (O H  â¢    ).67â69   The principle of EPR is based on the reaction between the free radicals and the trap. 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TEMP) and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) are the widely used spin trap agents.65   The trap agents react with O H  â¢     to produce an intermediate compound. The characteristic peak of this intermediate compound may identify the radicals. In addition to EPR, HPLC may be used to detect free radicals. The intermediate produced during catalytic ozonation in HPLC is identified using trap agents and reactive species. The commonly used trap agents include salicylic acid, dimethyl sulfoxide, terephthalic acid (TA), hydroxybenzoic acid, and benzoic acid.70â72   The trap agents react with the free radicals and, in turn, produce intermediate compounds that prove the existence of free radicals. The concentration of free radicals may be calculated from the concentrations of the intermediates identified by the characteristic peak of this intermediate compound in HPLC. The quenching experiments are also used to identify the ROS in catalytic ozonation.66   Scavengers that mop up the ROS (free radicals) play an important role in these experiments. The widely used scavengers include ethylene-di-amine tetra acetic acid, TA, tertiary butanol, methanol, ethanol, benzoquinone, chloroform, and isopropanol.65   The principle of this method is based on the reactions rates differences between the free radical and the selective scavenger. The selectivity of the scavenger is very important during the quenching experiments.   11.6 Analytical techniques used in catalytic ozonation 11.6.1 Characterization of catalysts First, the information on the catalyst that may be gleaned from mandatory physicochemical characterization studies is listed.33,73  1. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) are used to find the supported particleâs size, shape, and dispersion state. They help to identify differences between the fresh and spent catalysts and the extent of agglomeration of the catalyst particles. For instance, Xiong et al.18   could infer that the Mn and Fe oxide nanoparticles were uniformly  coated on the surface of the granular activated carbon (GAC) support. Further SEM may be coupled with energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) to identify elemental composition on the catalyst surface.  2. BET analyses yield parameters such as the surface area of the support for N2  adsorption and its pore size and distribution. Supports with high surface areas such as AC, Al2 O3 , and carbon nanotubes are useful in catalysts. When catalysts are doped with metals, their performance increases owing to the addition of acidic and basic active sites. On the other hand, the pore surface areas may be blocked and may become inaccessible. Hence an optimal doping extent is to be determined.  3. Diffraction patterns from XRD analyses are helpful in identifying different phases in a catalyst. For example, it may be used to follow the reduction of alumina-supported Î±-Fe2 O3  into iron. From the width of the diffraction patterns, the volume-averaged crystallite thickness may be obtained from Scherrerâs formula as a quick estimate. The peak positions of the diffraction spectra help to identify the crystallographic phases. Xiong et al.18   found no diffraction peaks of Mn and Fe oxide in their metal oxide-supported GAC catalyst, indicating that these oxides were amorphous.  4. XPS analyses help to estimate the composition and oxidation state of the metals in the catalyst. Reaction mechanisms, catalytic activation, poisoning, and occurrence of redox reactions facilitating catalytic ozonation may be studied using this technique. Based on the Fe2p XPS data, Xiong et al.18   observed that Fe2+  increased at the expense of Fe3+  after catalytic ozonation, thereby establishing the redox mechanism. From the Mn2p spectra, they could establish the presence of Mn in oxidation states from 2 to 4. The decrease in the Mn4+  state after catalytic ozonation indicated that Mn4+  oxidized the pollutant (phenol). Li Yang et al.45   estimated MnOX   concentrations at the surface and bulk of mesoporous Î³-alumina support using XPS and ICP-OES. They found higher concentrations in the bulk than at the surface, which implied the presence of the manganese more in the interior pores rather than dispersion on the surface.45    5. FTIR techniques also help to track the catalytic mechanism. It showed the formation of metal oxides due to the reaction between ozone and Lewis acid sites, along with the production of new OH groups that functioned as active sites in the presence of the metal oxide catalyst.45   Blockage of Lewis acid sites by certain ligands, such as phosphates and sulphates, could also be identified.  6. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) scans help to understand the electron transfer processes at the catalyst solution interfaces. Strong oxidation-reduction cycles involving the catalyst show up as intense anodic and cathodic peaks in the CV spectrum and is a measure of the catalytic activity.74     7. Thermogravimetric analyses help to understand the thermal stability and the changes in the surface chemistry of the catalyst when it is heated.75   Dehydration involving hygroscopic water, subsequent dehydroxylation of the crystal lattice, and structural changes due to dissociation of the catalyst may be inferred from the percentage weight loss plotted against temperature.     11.6.2 Analytical instruments used to identify the intermediates Identifying and quantifying the intermediates formed during the oxidation of organic pollutants, such as phenolic compounds by ozonation or catalytic ozonation, is critical. Many analytical instruments were used to identify intermediates; GCâMS, LCMS, and HPLC are commonly used. The list of instruments used in the literature to identify and quantify the intermediates formed during the ozonation is listed in Table 11.4 .   11.7 Effect of operating variables in catalytic ozonation Operating variables such as the solution pH, initial pollutant concentration, ozone dosage, and catalyst dosage played an important role in the degradation of the pollutant and COD/TOC reduction. The effect of these operating variables on the degradation of phenolic compounds has been investigated in the literature,60â62   mainly through batch studies. 11.7.1 pH of the solution In the ozonation system, the solution pH plays a significant role as it controls the formation of hydroxyl radicals, surface properties of the catalyst, and dissociation of pollutants.34   The degradation reaction mechanism follows two pathways: indirect oxidation through hydroxyl radicals and direct reaction pathway by O3.  The decomposition of ozone into H O  â¢     increases with solution pH, which enhances the degradation of recalcitrant pollutants and results in higher COD/TOC reduction. The increase in degradation efficiency of organic compounds with an increase in the initial pH of the solution has been reported in many studies.76â79   The effects of the solution pH on the phenol degradation and TOC removal in the O3 /AC system have been investigated.19   They concluded that the phenol degradation efficiency increased with solution pH during the first 25 minutes. Further, the reaction solution pH decreased significantly with time and stabilized around a pH of 3 at 90 minutes. This indicated that most carboxylic acids (e.g., oxalic, maleic, and fumaric  acid) were formed during the oxidation reaction. Degradation of the industrial-based wastewater sample in catalytic ozonation has been investigated,80   who found that the %COD removal increased from 33 to 57 when pH increased from 4 to 10. With increasing pH, more HO  â¢     will be generated due to the presence of an excess amount of hydroxyl ions. It was also experimentally verified that the pH of the solution declined with time during the ozonation reaction.81   The point of zero charges (pHPZC ) of the catalyst significantly affects the degradation of the organic pollutants.30   It was reported that if the solution pH is below the pHPZC , then the surface of the catalyst is positively charged, enabling interactions with negatively charged pollutants. Whereas, if the solution pH is above the pHPZC , then the surface is negatively charged, enabling interactions with positively charged pollutants. The ozonation process was effective at high solution pH, whereas catalytic ozonation processes such as O3 /ZnO, O3 /PdO/CeO2 , O3 /Fe(II), O3 /Mn(II), and O3 /Cu(II) were very effective at low solution pH.79,81,82   Most metal catalysts chosen for the catalytic ozonation performed better at neutral/acidic pH values because of their pHPZC .30   It is imperative to avoid studying the effect of solution pH in isolation. The removal of the organic pollutant and the concentration of active sites, namely, OH, groups on the catalyst surface depend strongly on the solidâs pHPZC  and the pollutantâs pKA . The effect of pH has to be hence understood mechanistically. Different pH conditions may be explored to identify the optimal performances of various catalytic ozonation systems.  11.7.2 Initial pollutant concentration The percentage removal of organic compounds and percentage COD/TOC removal decrease with an increase in initial concentration of organic pollutants.64,83,84   The effect of operating variables in catalytic ozonation for degrading reactive red 198 azo dye has been investigated.83   They reported that while the initial dye concentration increased from 100 to 500 mg/L, the %COD removal decreased from 67% to 40%. The degradation of 4-nitrophenol (4NP) in catalytic ozonation with Mn-Co-Fe catalyst has been investigated. The percentage of TOC removal was nearly 100% within 60 minutes at the low concentration of 4NP of 5 mg/L, while only 65% of TOC removal was achieved at the high 4NP concentration of 20 mg/L. The amount of reaction intermediates formed during the ozonation reaction increases with the increase in initial pollutant concentration,79   which increases ozone consumption. The newly formed intermediates compete with the primary pollutant as well for the catalytic active sites and ROS.   11.7.3 Ozone dose An increase in ozone dose enhances the transfer of ozone to organic pollutants. At higher ozone concentrations, increased formation of HO  â¢     led to increased percentage removals of the organic pollutants as well as COD/TOC. Catalytic ozonation of 4-nitrophenol (4NP) with a mesoporous Î± â MnO 2   as a catalyst has been studied,85   and it was found that the percentage TOC removal increased from 50% to 90% within 90 minutes with an increase in ozone dose from 10 to 50 mg/L. On the other hand, the percentage degradation of 4NP was increased from 95% to 100% with an increase in ozone dose from 10 to 50 mg/L. Nearly 100% degradation of 4NP but only 90% TOC removal by catalytic ozonation implies the incomplete oxidation of intermediates. Degradation of p-chloronitrobenzene (p-CNB) using pumice as a catalyst has been studied86   and found that the degradation efficiencies within 20 minutes were 86%, 90%, and 99% with an ozone dose of 0.6, 1.2, and 2.4 mg/L respectively. Similar findings have been reported in several other studies as well for various organic compounds.50,76    11.7.4 Catalyst dosage It is important to determine the optimum catalyst dosage in catalytic ozonation processes. The chemisorption of organic compounds on the surface and degradation by ozone and/or HO  â¢     was an essential step in catalytic ozonation.87   An increase in catalyst dosage provides more surface active sites, thus, enhancing the decomposition of ozone molecules into higher amounts of HO  â¢     and the adsorption. The degradation of phenol in catalytic ozonation with activated carbon as a catalyst has been studied19   and found that while the AC dosage increased from 0.25 to 1 g/L, the percentage of TOC removal was significantly increased from 50% to 76%. Hence, the percentage of TOC removal increases with an increase in catalyst dosage, but an excess amount of catalyst may lead to particle agglomeration, reduction in surface area, and insignificant degradation. The increase in degradation efficiency and COD/TOC removal with an increase in catalyst dosage have been reported in several other works of literature as well.86,88â90    11.7.5 Scope of catalytic ozonation In this chapter, several catalytic ozonation studies involving many organic compounds at a laboratory scale have been summarized. Metal oxides such as iron oxide, manganese oxide, cerium oxide, doped metal oxide, mixed metal oxide, and metal oxide supported on activated carbon or other mesoporous materials have been explored widely as  catalysts. The following aspects should be taken into account to deepen the understanding as well as the application of catalytic ozonation in water pollution abatement.1. The application of catalytic ozonation for treating industrial effluents is essential as the effluents contain multifarious organic pollutants of higher concentration. More studies are required to treat effluents from polymer, mining, and fertilizer industries on which studies, to the best of our knowledge, are scarce.  2. The impregnation of more than one metal oxide on mesoporous support may create new active sites exhibiting different catalytic activities and selectivities. Therefore more studies are required to focus on the bimetallic catalyst support involving mesoporous materials to treat different industrial effluents that mostly have many pollutants to achieve higher degradation efficiencies. The catalyst may be tailored to target specific key contaminants in the industrial effluent. These experimental studies must also be accompanied by sufficient characterization to deepen mechanistic understanding of catalytic ozonation with bimetallic catalyst supports.  3. To sustain the catalytic ozonation process, especially for the treatment of municipal wastewater and industrial effluents, a better understanding of the effect of process variables, including pH, the optimum dosage of both ozone and the catalyst, and better utilization of the expensive ozone are urgently required.  4. Hybrid methods are economically viable techniques for the treatment of various pollutants. More attention should be given to integrating catalytic ozonation with different techniques, such as biological wastewater treatment and electrolytic processes (such as electroperoxone process91  ), to improve the complete degradation of organic compounds in less time.      11.8 Stability and reusability of metal catalysts A major drawback of metal oxide-based catalysts is the leaching of metal ions into the solution.92,93   Leaching will generate secondary pollution in the aqueous stream and gradual catalyst deactivation18,85   over additional cycles. Xiong et al.18   investigated the effect of the Fe and/or Mn-supported GAC catalyst for the degradation of phenol and revealed that the Fe and Mn ions concentration in the reaction solution were considerably higher for O  3   + Fe / Mn   system compared with those of the O  3   + Fe   and O  3   + Mn   systems.18   This was attributed to the galvanic corrosion coupling effects between Mn and Fe. The release of both Mn2+  and Fe2+  into the solution from Fe3 O4  and MnO2  led to an increase in the metal ions concentration. This is further manifested in the reduction of the number of active sites and stability of the catalyst. It is recommended to develop environmentally friendly catalysts with good stability as well as high activity in catalytic ozonation. Although the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation systems demonstrate high performance, further studies on the reusability and stability of the catalysts are needed.  11.9 Conclusions and future perspective Ozonation is an effective advanced oxidation process for the degradation and mineralization of different organic pollutants through direct and/or indirect oxidation. The effect of different operational variables such as pH, pollutant concentration, ozone dose, and catalyst dosage on the efficiency of the catalytic ozonation may be better understood through a formal design of experiments study rather than one variable at a time investigation. The effect of interaction between the parameters will indicate synergetic/antagonistic effects, and superior optimization may be enabled through a formal response surface methodology. Possibilities are rich for incorporating a mixture of metal dopants/metal oxides on mesoporous supports to enhance the number and type of active sites. In recent years, metal nanoparticles have been extensively used in catalytic ozonation process due to their excellent physicochemical properties. In these studies, identifying suitable proportions of metal dopants, nanoparticles, and catalysts on supports will help achieve optimal performance. Fundamental molecular simulations are recommended to provide more insight and validation of the different reaction mechanisms that have been proposed. More studies are required on the quantitative analysis of degradation pathways and rate constants identified for the by-product formation. Rather than a single pollutant, an appropriate mixture of pollutants may be considered. While many studies have been carried out with model pollutants, more are required involving synthetic and real industrial wastewater to test the efficacy of catalytic ozonation in practical field conditions. This needs to be accompanied by estimating the leaching of the metal catalysts, regeneration of the spent catalysts, the number of cycles the catalysts may be reused, and toxicity studies on suitable biological microorganisms. Incorporating the above in future research works will ensure a proper understanding of the promising catalytic ozonation technology and ascertain its sustainability.    References 1. R.K.
