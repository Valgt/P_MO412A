                  UNESCO Global Geoparks (UGGps) are territories that promote sustainable development through a territorial management plan focusing on education, conservation, and local development. In their guidelines, they establish, among others, the relevance of the territorial bottom-up approach. This implies the active involvement and participation of the local communities on the projects and strategies focusing on sustainable territorial development and management. In this sense, the participatory processes should be one of the main strategies for the progress, analysis and diagnosis on the development and management of the UGGps. On this scope, the use of geographic analysis tools, like interpretative maps of the territory and the application of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) through a collaborative approach, could be an asset for the spatial planning required in the UGGps, reinforced by the local knowledge. One of the main applications that can be implemented in UGGps for the improvement, adaptation, and actualization of the spatial planning and management of the territories is the application of collaborative mapping strategies. This work is an example of a methodological proposal for the spatial diagnosis of the sustainable development in four UGGps of the Latin America and Caribbean Geoparks Network (GeoLAC) through a collaborative mapping process. This should be understood as a map's creation practice by local communities' perception. In addition, it also allows the understanding of the dynamics, evolution, and transformation of the UGGps through community knowledge and citizen science, supporting the improvement of the management plans of each territory. The objective of this methodology is to identify and discuss the spatial and territorial distribution of the “geopark” concept and how different activities related to geoconservation, geoeducation and geotourism, as main axes of the principles of the UGGp, are acting for and contributing to the sustainable development in four UGGps of the GeoLAC. Results allow to define new strategies to involve, in a more homogeneous spatial distribution, the impacts and benefits of the UGGps. The final maps become important tools not only for researchers or managers but also for local communities. This methodology has the potential to become a tool for its application in any UGGp willing to analyze the spatial distribution of the territorial strategies, the activities impact, and the benefits for the sustainable development of its territory. Furthermore, it can be an efficient evaluation tool when applied periodically in the territory, allowing to compare the development and evolution of the spatial impacts and territorial dynamics of the strategies defined by the management structure, calibrated by the vision and perception of the local communities.

Quinta de Prados 5000-801 Vila Real Portugal       UNESCO Global Geoparks (UGGps) are territories that promote sustainable development through a territorial management plan focusing on education, conservation, and local development. In their guidelines, they establish, among others, the relevance of the territorial bottom-up approach. This implies the active involvement and participation of the local communities on the projects and strategies focusing on sustainable territorial development and management. In this sense, the participatory processes should be one of the main strategies for the progress, analysis and diagnosis on the development and management of the UGGps. On this scope, the use of geographic analysis tools, like interpretative maps of the territory and the application of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) through a collaborative approach, could be an asset for the spatial planning required in the UGGps, reinforced by the local knowledge. One of the main applications that can be implemented in UGGps for the improvement, adaptation, and actualization of the spatial planning and management of the territories is the application of collaborative mapping strategies. This work is an example of a methodological proposal for the spatial diagnosis of the sustainable development in four UGGps of the Latin America and Caribbean Geoparks Network (GeoLAC) through a collaborative mapping process. This should be understood as a map's creation practice by local communities' perception. In addition, it also allows the understanding of the dynamics, evolution, and transformation of the UGGps through community knowledge and citizen science, supporting the improvement of the management plans of each territory. The objective of this methodology is to identify and discuss the spatial and territorial distribution of the “geopark” concept and how different activities related to geoconservation, geoeducation and geotourism, as main axes of the principles of the UGGp, are acting for and contributing to the sustainable development in four UGGps of the GeoLAC. Results allow to define new strategies to involve, in a more homogeneous spatial distribution, the impacts and benefits of the UGGps. The final maps become important tools not only for researchers or managers but also for local communities. This methodology has the potential to become a tool for its application in any UGGp willing to analyze the spatial distribution of the territorial strategies, the activities impact, and the benefits for the sustainable development of its territory. Furthermore, it can be an efficient evaluation tool when applied periodically in the territory, allowing to compare the development and evolution of the spatial impacts and territorial dynamics of the strategies defined by the management structure, calibrated by the vision and perception of the local communities.   Keywords collaborative methods  territorial management plan  bottom-up approach  participatory process  citizen science    1 Introduction Collaborative mapping is a derived method of the Participatory Action Research (PAR) which can be defined as the “research by, with, and for people affected by a particular problem, which takes places in collaboration with academic researchers. It seeks to democratize knowledge production and foster opportunities for empowerment by those involved” (Kindon, Pain, & Kesby, 2009 ). It is commonly referred that the PAR appeared in the second half of the 20th century as a response to post-industrial societies, which, due to their systematic and institutional structure, led segments of world society to the exclusion and isolation, leaving them without capacity to contribute actively to the creation of their social and governance structures (Park, 1992 ). The PAR approaches had been mainly used in the social sciences in education, health and psychology domains (Lewin, 1946 ; Ana Mercedes Colmenares, 2011 ; Díez Gutiérrez, 2013 ). In this sense, Selener (1997)  defined PAR as “a process by which members of an oppressed group or community collect and analyze information, and act on their problems with the purpose of finding solutions and promoting social and political transformations”. Hence, PAR emerges to empower the populations least involved in the construction of their own societies, so that they can take effective actions to improve their living conditions and the local management of their communities according to their needs and characteristics. Regarding the collaborative mapping, also referred to as the Participative Social Cartography (PSC), this is described as the set of methods and techniques used to link the local organizations with the academic ones for research and decision-making purposes in the management of a territory. Its objective is not only to collect information on a specific problem, but also, above all, operate as an instance that allows activating a collective discussion on a specific territorial imaginary in favor of its transformation processes (Saravia-Ramos, Vega-Valdés, Espinoza-Almonacid, & Gutiérrez-Soto, 2021 ). Based on these considerations, the imaged maps represent the hierarchies and priorities of the local authors (the communities). In this sense, understanding the territory through the vision of the local communities allows us to recognize the studied area as the result of a spatial discontinuity, but with overlapped and united experiences (Haesbaert, 2011 ) by ties of cooperation, common histories of resistance and oppression, reproduction of unwanted practices, conflicts or negotiation, and ways of being in the world. Therefore, the territory is conceived as the result of dialogue and joint work resulting from common points and differentiating elements (Saravia-Ramos et al., 2021 ). The participatory mapping process is understood as the map's creation practice through local communities' interpretation. It is a methodology that allows considering and incorporating the local knowledge in the spatial interpretations and representations of the territories (Karimi & Brown, 2017 ). This approach, based on the local perception, allows the identification of priorities, needs, and issues by the people who live and interact every day in the territory (Pearson et al., 2017 ). Considering this, we can choose axes of action about diverse topics related to specific situations and places (Brown et al., 2018 ). This type of methodologies have been used for different purposes, both for spatial planning and for the formulation of policies in environmental management, taking advantage of local and collaborative knowledge. For example, Beaudoin, Mistry, and Young (2022)  reported the application of several workshops with local stakeholders to characterize socio-ecological systems in order to improve the local policies on the management of public natural environments for recreational and historic values. García-Nieto et al. (2015)  discussed and explored differences in the perception of the spatial distribution of ecosystem services supply and demand between different stakeholders through collaborative mapping. Ribeiro and Ribeiro (2016)  reported the relevance of participative mapping for the characterization and identification of the cultural ecosystem services. Similarly, in the domains of environmental and territorial planning, Zunariyah and Ramdhon (2016)  used the OpenStreetMap  as a free-editing platform with spatial information available for all the users, allowing them to update data and collect information regarding the land use planning of the rivers in Surakarta, Indonesia. In another example, the OpenStreetMap  was previously used to identify the land use patterns in metropolises through a collaborative mapping approach (Arsanjania & Vaz, 2015 ). From the spatial point of view, this methodology has the possibility to be applied at different scales, from local scale to regional and global scales. For example, Kraxner et al. (2017)  applied participatory and collaborative mapping on a global scale, with the objective of mapping the forest certified for sustainable management, creating a global information tool. Moreover, the collaborative mapping has been used to identify territorial inequalities, like the public health services, to support the local administration on the decision-making for the establishment of new infrastructures (Pou-Martí et al., 2021 ). Other works have used collaborative mapping to measure the distribution of environmental noise mapping in cities (Guillaume et al., 2016 ). In the field of social sciences, collaborative mapping to identify socio-territorial conflicts has been also applied (Vavrouchová, Fukalová, Svobodová, Oulehla, & Pokorná, 2021 ) for local indigenous territorial identity and management (Galdino, Neto, da Silva, & Gorayeb, 2016 ), as well as for works on mapping actors, actions, and solidary territorial relations (Esteves, Pereira, & Spink, 2019 ), for the empowerment of local communities (Panek & Netek, 2019 ), and for urban design and planning (Stupar, Mihajlov, Lalovic, Colic, & Petrovic, 2019 ). Regarding UNESCO Global Geoparks (UGGps), few studies have used these methods (Rosado-González, 2020 ; Rosado-González, Palacio-Prieto, & Sá, 2021 ). For example, Leman, Ramli, and Khirotdin (2016)  referred the creation of an integrated Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based assessment for land use planning and identification of environmentally sensitive areas. Samat and Harun (2013)  carried out a study to assess the pressure of urban development and sustainable tourism in the same territory. Additionally, another study in the Xingwen UGGp, China about the tourism development and the territorial management using geospatial analysis was carried out by Shui and Xu (2016) . In the same way, an evaluation of land use with regional spatial plan was carried out using satellite data and GIS in the Batur UGGp, Indonesia (Utama, Osawa, & Adnyana, 2018 ). Regarding geological heritage management, Mampel, Cobos, Alcalá, Luque, and Royo-Torres (2009)  reported the use of GIS to create an integrated system for the dinosaur sites in the Maestrazgo UGGp, in Spain. Moreover, Soncco (2020)  used high-resolution cartography for the management and monitoring of the geosites in the Estrela UGGp, Portugal, and Beserra (2011)  developed a project to stablish a GIS for the geopark territorial management in the Araripe UGGp, Brazil. Although these previous publications have explored the use of mapping technologies and mapping analysis for territorial sustainable management and development in UGGps, the participatory and collaborative approach has not been considered. Research about the UGGps has been done with different collaborative and participative approaches, but without the mapping and cartography components. In this context, some of the applied works have highlighted the importance of working closely with the local communities to involve them with the UGGp processes, initiatives, and management. This is one of the ways to implement the bottom-up development approach for the sustainable development in these territories (Rosado-González & Ramírez-Miguel, 2017 ; Rosado-González, Sá, & Palacio-Prieto, 2020 ; Rosado-González, 2020 ; Rosado-González, Ferraro, Palacio-Prieto, & Sá, 2022 ; Ferraro, Schilling, Baeza, Oms, & Sá, 2020 ; Ferraro et al., 2021 ; Ferraro, 2021 ). Other works about the participative methods applied in the UGGps involve the analysis of the visitor and tourism experiences (Fung & Jim, 2015 ). Also, Stoffelen, Groote, Meijles, and Weitkamp (2019) , and Van Geert (2019)  evaluated the territorial identity in the UGGps and the geopark label as a place branding. In addition, Yang, Gao, Li, and Van Eetvelde (2020) , and Hernández-Aguilar, Durán, de Jong, Velázquez, and Pérez-Verdín (2021)  applied the collaborative approaches for the purpose of identification, evaluation, and evolution of the landscape. In this context, the works regarding collaborative mapping applied to UGGps are scarce, which represents a new field of opportunities in research, citizen science, and territorial management strategies. Considering this, the purpose of this work is to discuss the applicability of this kind of methodology as a supportive tool for UGGps management, pondering the territorial dynamic on their issues and potentials. This work tries to examine the SWOT components of this methodology, and to identify in which cases these methods can be an optimal tool to support decision-making in the UGGps territorial management. The discussion of the application of this method can reveal how to improve and adapt the collaborative approaches and citizen science to be more effective in supporting the management plans of these territories.  2 Methodology In the fields of social sciences and humanities research, the participatory approach can be a fundamental tool for understanding social processes and dynamics. In this sense, one way to study and analyze the UGGps' contribution to sustainable development, regarding territorial planning, is through the inhabitant's perception using the participatory mapping research methods. This kind of research can be strengthened with new technologies such as GIS (Brown et al., 2018 ), which allows interpreting the territorial sustainable development and management of the UGGps in their geographical domain and helps understand the distribution of the spatial phenomena, bearing in mind the improvement of the territorial sustainability planning. The results allow classifying the spatial distribution of the impacts of the geopark in the territory through different aspects, including good practices, potential areas, and issues to be solved, giving guidelines for the management and planning strategies. With these results, it is possible to create new strategies to involve a more homogeneous spatial distribution of the impacts and benefits of the UGGp. This methodology has the potential to become a tool to be applied in any UGGp willing to study the spatial distribution of the management strategies, activity impacts and benefits on the sustainable development of the territories through time. In order to identify and discuss the territorial dynamics, the presence and distribution of the UGGp concept and their activities, four GeoLAC UGGps were selected (Araripe UGGp, Brazil; Grutas del Palacio UGGp, Uruguay; Comarca Minera UGGp and Mixteca Alta UGGp, Mexico). Workshops took place in all territories including activities of participative cartography, with the direct involvement of representative groups of local inhabitants. The following aspects were considered for the construction of maps:(1) areas, sites and/or corridors with high tourism influence;  (2) areas, sites and/or corridors with greatest economic benefits;  (3) areas, sites and/or corridors less engaged with the geopark concept and activities;  (4) areas, sites and/or corridors with more educational activities identified;  (5) areas, sites and/or corridors environmentally more preserved;  (6) areas, sites and/or corridors of local and sustainable production identified;  (7) areas, sites and/or corridors related with well-being and healthy lifestyles;  (8) areas, sites and/or corridors with identified conservation and natural restoration policies;  (9) areas, sites and/or corridors more affected due the climate change;  (10) areas, sites and/or corridors polluted;  (11) areas, sites and/or corridors with highest need of clean water and sanitization;  (12) areas, sites and/or corridors with more needs of security and peace;  (13) areas, sites and/or corridors of women cooperatives created/promoted under the auspice of the management structure;  (14) areas, sites and/or corridors with waste management initiatives;  (15) areas, sites and/or corridors that promotes social equity and justice;  (16) areas, sites and/or corridors with educational potential not considered in the master plan;  (17) areas, sites and/or corridors with touristic potential not considered into the master plan;  (18) areas, sites and/or corridors with environmental conservation that requires management structure action;  (19) areas, sites and/or corridors with sustainable production potential not considered by the management structure;  (20) areas, sites and/or corridors for water environment conservation, sustainable initiatives and/or ecological restoration;  (21) areas, sites and/or corridors with sustainable community infrastructures and services for development;  (22) areas, sites and/or corridors with more community participation and solidarity.    During each workshop, base sketch-maps in greyscale with minimal geographical information were designed to allow the participants to identify the influence areas for each of the 22 aspects mentioned above. Maps included only basic information, such as main roads, municipal limits and/or localities/geosites. The objective behind the application of this methodology was to identify and discuss the spatial and territorial distribution of the geopark concept and how the different activities of geoconservation, geoeducation and geotourism, as main axes of the principles of the UGGps, were acting and contributing for the sustainable development in the four studied GeoLAC UGGp. Two workshops were organized in each geopark to obtain the data through participatory mapping process, with representative groups, which included members of the management staff, tourism services and educational sectors, guides, artisans, coordinators of projects or associations, among other stakeholders of each one of these territories (Fig. 1  ). All the participants provided their informed consent to participate in this study. Maps were prepared in reference to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda. Participants worked in groups identifying relevant information regarding the 22 main aspects defined above (Rosado-González, 2020 ). To analyze the data obtained trough the resulting maps, the first step of the procedure was to vectorize the information in shape file format using ArcGIS 10.7, classifying the marks and traces on the paper in points, lines, and polygon shapefiles of each one of 22 aspects. After uploading and classifying all the information in the GIS, the repeated marks that coincided in the same sites and/or areas were quantified and grouped. Finally, those data already grouped where there was a higher concentration of marks made by the different participants were marked in the GIS with a larger buffer, while the fewer participants marked the same sites, the buffer was less, always respecting a direct proportion between participants and the buffer size.  3 Results In each geopark, two workshops were held with different local actors, from which a total of 88 maps were obtained, 22 aspects of eachterritory and each of the aspects were considered. In this work, two maps were presented as an example for each geopark that show the four most relevant aspects that were considered according to the perception of the participants in the workshops. These maps were the examples due to the impossibility of including the 22 aspects indicated in a single map, although, as mentioned, they represented the distribution of the most relevant ones (Fig. 2   to Fig. 9 ). The mapped aspects were related to some of the SDGs, which allowed us to understand, from a spatial perspective, how the perception of sustainable development in these territories distributed (Table 1  ). For the Araripe UGGp, Fig. 2  represented the distribution of new suitable partners for the local production, and Fig. 3   depicted the information concerning the spatial capability to promote new educative and geotourism initiatives. Fig. 1 , mainly prepared by women and local producers, reflected the importance of initiatives which focused on local production and eventual organization of stakeholders in cooperatives. Women empowerment, in Araripe UGGp as well as in other geoparks, was reflected by a number of initiatives organized under the auspices of the management structures as shown in Juazeiro do Norte, where two non-governmental organizations (NGOs), with a strong participation of women, were strongly engaged with the UGGp management structure. Association of the Cordel Literature and the Lira Nordestina Association were also important, where cultural activities and workshops were promoted to all the communities. Another spot was in Barbalha City, where the Cultural Center of ‘School of Knowledge’ promoted a small market for women producers and artisans every week, without any fee, in order to help them in the promotion and trade of their products. The potential of sustainable production in the four territories were considered, the smallest communities and/or those which already had some types of sustainable production, but were not yet engaged with the management structure, or had the need of further promotion and training, were indentified. Fig. 3  showed the map of the spatial capability for new educative and geotouristic activities; this considered the areas that already had several educative programs and those areas with tourism potential but without initiatives implemented by the management structure of the UGGp. During the participative mapping workshops in the studied UGGps, the main areas where educational activities were implemented, the county seat cities, and/or the main urban settlements of the territories were indentified. In the case of the Araripe UGGp, three cities with the presence of educational institutions were identified. They were the Araripe UGGp Interpretation Centre in Crato City, which was placed in main campus of the Regional University of Cariri (URCA); the Casa Grande Foundation in Nova Olinda City, and the Paleontological Museum in Santana do Cariri City. They, under the URCA coordination, all offered continuous programs of internships for basic education level students, including educational programs. With regard to the touristic potential not considered or exploited in the four UGGps, the participants signalized geosites that were not properly exploited for tourism initiatives, and other areas that didn't have geosites identified but had the potential of geotourism. For example, the Barbalha locality and the waterfall of Missão Velha in the Araripe UGGp were identified, which were geosites with high potential but not properly promoted for geotourism. Regarding the UGGp Grutas del Palacio, Fig. 4   showed the territorial and economic development through geotourism, and Fig. 5   represented the areas with the capacity to develop environmental education programs. In Fig. 4 , the areas with high tourist influx were identified and, consequently, those with the greatest economic benefit in the UGGp due to local initiatives were promoted by the management structure and interest groups. Tourism activities in the four geoparks were often associated with tourist sites of interest prior to their designation as geosites. The relationship between tourist activities and urban areas was also frequent. The foregoing was evident in the case of Grutas del Palacio UGGp, where a tourist corridor could be seen extending along the highway that connected the City of Trinidad and the north of the territory. 6 of the 12 geosites of the geopark were located in this corridor, including the best known one which gave its name to this geopark: Grutas del Palacio. This corridor also included Lake Andresito, which recently became popular throughout the country for water sports. The greatest economic benefits in this geopark were identified mainly in the three most touristic sites in the territory, the Talice Nature Reserve, the Grutas del Palacio geosite and the Andresito Lake. These sites were well integrated by the highway that connected the city of Trinidad (within the UGGp) and Montevideo (Capital of Uruguay) and to the north, with the City of Paysandú. Fig. 5  related to Grutas del Palacio UGGp referred to the areas with the greatest capacity to develop environmental education programs. In this sense, the two aspects represented were the points with educational potential that were not contemplated in the territorial master plan, and the areas with initiatives for ecological restoration and conservation of the water environment. Considering the identified points that are related to the educational potential are not included in the master plan of the four UGGps, it is possible to conclude that although there are already educational programs that have been carried out continuously, there is an interest in expanding them and incorporating a greater number of local participants. In the Grutas del Palacio Geopark, four locations were identified to implement these educational activities. In this context, Lake Andresitos standed out in order to combine recreational activities with educational ones. Regarding the conservation areas of aquatic environments and sustainable initiatives, it was important to note that none of the four UGGps was in coastal areas. In this sense, the identified points were only associated with rivers or lakes. For example, the points identified in Grutas del Palacio UGGp were associated with fish farming initiatives in Lake Andresito. In the maps generated for the UGGp of the Mixteca Alta, Fig. 6   showed the areas where it was necessary to strengthen mitigation and environmental and agricultural conservation, while Fig. 7   identified the places where it was necessary to implement environmental and agricultural policies for better environmental management. Fig. 6  showed the areas most impacted by climate change and the places that require special attention, in order to integrate them into the territorial management plan as part of environmental conservation. In relation to the points most affected by climate change, it was identified that the main problem was related to drought events and the consequent lack of water in the four geoparks. Regarding the Mixteca Alta UGGp, given that the main economic activity of the territory was agriculture, it was identified that the entire territory was significantly affected by climate change, which was evidenced by the change in the temporal distribution of rainfall, and was also reflected in less water availability. Considering the importance of implementing environmental protection policies or strategies in the four studied geoparks, it was possible to identify areas that required direct action and implementation of environmental conservation measures. In the case of the Mixteca Alta UGGp, on one hand, the territory was characterized by extensive erosion (badlands); on the other hand, by the worldview of the local traditional indigenous culture, the perception of the inhabitants was strongly linked to the nature and to the “Mother Earth”. For these reasons, the participants identified that the entire territory needed to make more efforts for nature conservation during the workshop. In addition, the map of requirements to implement environmental management policies of the Mixteca Alta UGGp showed the areas with the greatest contamination and those with the greatest need of clean water and sanitation (Fig.7 ). Regarding the occurrence of contamination identified in the four UGGps, the obtained result  showed that the main sources of contamination occured essentially in the main urban areas and were along the main roads and rivers. In the case of the Mixteca Alta UGGp, the main accessible roads to the territory were related to the most contaminated areas. This was essentially due to the lack of preventive campaigns which focused on the disposal of garbage from vehicles. The need of drinking water and sanitation was a cross-cutting problem for all the settlements in the geoparks studied. As an example, in the case of Mixteca Alta UGGp, it was important to mention that all urban areas were small. Despite this, the territory was quite isolated and poor, so there was a great lack of services and infrastructure for sanitation and water supply, and this problem were identified in all the towns and communities, and the situation in the main urban areas was more complex. In relation to the maps on Comarca Minera UGGp, Fig. 8   showed the potential to build and strengthen areas of social attention, and Fig. 9   showed potential areas to reinforce local commitment. As for the places with the greatest social instability and insecurity, they were mostly correlated with urban settlements in the four UGGps. Despite this, the general perception of the population was that the territories were quite safe and peaceful in the four geoparks. However, for the Comarca Minera UGGp, the main focuses on this issue were found in the poorest areas of the urban settlements of the City of Mineral de la Reforma. Here, in the opinion of the workshop participants, an incipient insecurity related to the expansion of tourism and the lack of management strategies was identified. Considering the points of greatest community solidarity in the four UGGps, the participants identified the most committed places, where the neighbors had been more proactive in cooperating with the territorial management structures. In the case of the Comarca Minera UGGp, the best example of community solidarity was the Magic Town of Huasca de Ocampo, which through the House of Culture, promoted diversified community activities, being an example of good practices of empowerment and solidarity. In the case of the least committed points in the studied UGGps, the areas that had tourism offered or had potential tourist sites were identified, however, neither the municipalities nor the sites, had the management structures of the UGGp that achieved an effective participation of the locals. In the case of the Comarca Minera UGGp, it was verified that tourist and economic activities took place mainly in the municipalities that exhibited the label “Pueblos Mágicos”. The remaining municipalities lagged and were not considered, they did carry out tourist or economic activities either. It was also identified that some geosites had residual tourist activity and could desirably be more involved. Considering the sustainable infrastructures for the benefit of the community, it was identified that all the geosites had good accessibility, museums and interpretation centers in the four UGGps.  4 Discussion After applying the exposed methodology and obtaining the different results in the different themes and territories, it is important to highlight that citizen science is a very powerful tool when we are studying and working regarding territorial management to support the decision-making process. The PAR strategies used in this work assumes the relevance of democratize knowledge production and promotes opportunities for those involved as assumed by Kindon et al. (2009) . This work not only helps understand the value of the PSC in linking the local population and organization with the academic ones for research, but also has benifits for territorial management as what it has presented in the objectives of this research. It is important to notice that the marked areas are the ones identified according to the participant's perception of the priorities for action, this does not mean that there are no other areas with same or similar characteristics. After the development of this research, it is evident that this kind of method can be improved to have more indicators and precision of data, this approach is generic, but may be not very useful for some kind of topics or issues. On the other hand, this allows the local participants to have a more realistic and introspective vision of their own territory by analyzing and discussing aspects that are important to them but not necessarily evident in their day-to-day life, and allows them to underline that it is necessary to act on them. To better discuss how the application of this kind of methodology of collaborative mapping in UGGps can be used, a SWOT analysis are presented and discussed in Fig. 10  .  5 Conclusions In the first place, it is important to point out that the methodology used in this study is based on the perception of the population, which always implies a degree of subjectivity. However, the perception is indicative of how the population, through the groups of participating people, identify the processes that are carried out in their respective territories. Taking this into account, collaborative mapping methodologies are useful tools to better understand the local and spatial perception of the events and the processes that occur in a territory. In this case, this tool can help analyze different realities and dynamics of the impacts of the territorial initiative and potential opportunities to improve the strategic plan in UGGps. However, one of the limitations of this methodology is that the obtained results can be influenced by time and by the perception of the focus group. However, this makes it possible to compare results from different time periods, and results according to the perceptions of different groups help consider different needs. With the obtained results, it is possible to propose and define new strategies that help the management structures establish more homogeneous territorial action plans based on a more precise knowledge of the impacts and benefits in each territorial portion. This makes it possible to resolve specific situations and/or establish territorial priorities for action. In this context, the dynamic maps become useful tools not only for managers but also for local communities, which can continue the citizen science work of recognizing and understanding the territories with a different approach, knowing the problems and contributing to the definition of territorial priorities and solutions. The proposed methodology also has the potential to become an applicable study tool in any UGGp that intends to analyze the spatial distribution of territorial strategies, the impact of activities and the benefits for the sustainable development of its territory. At the same time, it can be an efficient evaluation tool that can be applied in any UGGp during different time periods, allowing UGGp to compare the development and evolution of the spatial impacts and territorial dynamics of the strategies defined by the management structure in the territorial master plan, and calibrating with the vision and perception of local communities. Finally, it is important to mention that collaborative mapping techniques can have different and various approaches to collect and process data. In fact, the use of mobile applications and online GIS platforms, which can be easily accessed nowadays, opens up a wide field of opportunities in this type of initiative. In particular, with respect to the UGGps, the use of these technologies can support real-time monitoring of different natural or social events and phenomena, thus making it possible to have georeferenced and updated databases for the improvement of territorial management and decision-making for the implementation of new and better policies for sustainable territorial development.
