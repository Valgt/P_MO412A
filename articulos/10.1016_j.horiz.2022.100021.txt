                  Higher education has been a key driver of societal changes for centuries. To provide updates on how universities participated and contributed to the transition towards sustainable development, the current study firstly showcased how universities have embedded sustainable development goals into their visions, strategies, management, and plans across different continents. Then it reviewed the landscape of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) commitments across universities based on the Times Higher Education Impact Ranking. Our result revealed that the number of universities that declared their commitment to SDG keeps increasing, from 467 Universities from 74 countries/regions in 2019 to 1406 universities from 103 countries/regions in 2022. Furthermore, universities have shifted their biggest focus from SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) in 2019 to SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in 2022, and SDGs 14 (Life Below Water) and 15 (Life on Land) received the least attention among universities over the years. In the end, we urge universities worldwide to take action to embed sustainable development concept into the curriculum in all disciplines, and equip our students with proper knowledges that enable them to think and act in sustainable ways.

Keywords Higher education  Sustainable development  Social transition    Higher education has been a key driver of societal changes for centuries because it incubates new thoughts (Janssens et al., 2022 ), produces innovative technologies, and cultivates entrepreneurial talents (Milley & Szijarto, 2022 ; Etzkowitz et al., 2022 ). Facing the sustainable development challenges in the 21st century, many universities have embedded Sustainable Development Goals into their visions, strategies, management, and plans. Universities demonstrated their strategies toward SDGs at various levels. A survey of several European universities shows that 82% of 73 members of the European University Association have incorporated sustainability into their development strategies; 70% were already reporting on their sustainable development initiatives (Fassin, 2015 ). For instance, Lund University aspires to be a part of the sustainable solution and has initiated a graduate school focusing on societal challenges and the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development. University-wide and interdisciplinary Ph.D. courses on the 2030 Agenda were provided. Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) takes sustainability as one of four strategic research areas for 2014–2023. The program brings together the best minds from a range of disciplines to create the knowledge that society needs to understand and change unsustainable patterns of behavior and development (NTNU Sustainability, 2022 ). Universities in other parts of the world have also tackled sustainable development challenges. Arizona State University established the first school of sustainability in 2006 with the mission to foster innovative research, impactful education, and engaged communities to achieve environmental integrity, social equity, and well-being in the United States (Arizona State University, 2022 ). The School for Environment and Sustainability (SEAS) at the University of Michigan focused on various themes addressing global challenges at the nexus of environment and society (University of Michigan, 2022 ). Stanford University disclosed information about sustainability efforts across the Stanford campus on its homepage. It has announced a report reviewing the campus operations for the most efficient, sustainable performance since 2009. So far, Stanford Energy System Innovations has reduced campus greenhouse gas emissions by 68% and potable water consumption by 18% (Sustainable Stanford, 2022 ). Furthermore, Stanford University established its first new school in 70 years, i.e., the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability, aiming to catalyze interdisciplinary efforts to tackle urgent climate and sustainability challenges faced by people and ecosystems worldwide (Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability, 2022 ). Tsinghua University also launched its Institute for Sustainable Development Goals in 2017 and reported on SDGs for the first time in 2021 (Tsinghua University, 2021 ). The University of Tokyo also established the Institute for Future Initiatives (IFI) in April 2019, which makes policy and social recommendations on future society issues and pursues research in collaboration with society, aiming to accelerate university-wide efforts to promote and achieve the SDGs (The University of Tokyo, 2022 ). The Southern University of Science and Technology is also devoted to addressing sustainable development issues by establishing the Shenzhen Institute of Sustainable Development, supporting the international open-access journal Sustainable Horizons  that broadcasts the newest development in the field of sustainable development, adopting sponge city and energy-saving concepts in building campus infrastructures, among many other initiatives that were incorporated in the university strategies and management (Southern University of Science and Technology, 2022 ). These pioneering universities have stepped up for urgent sustainable development issues faced by people and the planet and served as role models for higher education worldwide. With the increasing engagement with the SDGs among universities, the Times Higher Education (THE) Impact Rankings started to assess universities’ efforts towards achieving the 17 SDGs in 2019 (The Times Higher Education, 2022 ), while Elsevier provided many data to support the ranking. It is remarkable how the number of universities that participated in this ranking keeps increasing, from 467 universities from 74 countries/regions in 2019 to 1406 universities from 103 countries/regions in 2022 (Figure 1  ). The distribution of these universities is demonstrated in Figure 2  . In 2019, Japan, the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, and Spain were the five countries with the most universities participating in the Impact Ranking (Supplementary Information 1). Turkey replaced the United States in 2020 among the top five, and India replaced Spain in the year after. In 2022, the countries with the most significant number of universities that disclosed their commitment to SDGs were Russia, Japan, Iran, Pakistan, India, and Turkey. The interests in different SDGs varied across universities over the years (Figure 3  ). In 2019, SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) is the most popular SDG among universities, followed by SDG 4 (Quality Education) and 5 (Gender Equality). The data in 2020 demonstrated that the focus on the SDG 3 was still leading the way. Still, it has declined compared to the previous year. At the same time, the number of universities committed to SDG 1 (No Poverty), 4 (Quality Education), 5 (Gender Equality), 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong institutions) was similar. In 2021 and 2022, SDG 4 (Quality Education) was no longer the most popular SDG among universities. In contrast, SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) took first place and was closely followed by SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation). SDGs 14 (Life Below Water) and 15 (Life on Land) received the least attention among universities over the years. These trends revealed that universities keep improving their strategy over SDG commitment. Universities play a crucial role in knowledge transfer and innovation. Facing the urgency for sustainable development, we call for universities worldwide to take action to embed sustainable development concept into the curriculum in all disciplines, and equip our students with proper knowledge that enable them to think and act in sustainable ways. Subsequently, graduates could bring the sustainable development concept to their future paths and benefit the whole society at large. Meanwhile, universities themselves should take action to accelerate their transitions towards sustainability, including but not limited to adopting energy-saving schemes, realizing carbon neutrality, and infusing sustainable development concepts in whole management progress. In addition, universities should establish communication platforms to enable social sectors and governments to accelerate their transition towards sustainability. As the need for sustainable development continues to grow, universities need to take more responsibilities to foster the sustainable transition.
