                  Wetlands, vital ecosystems that support 40 % of the world's species and serve as nature's water filters, are disappearing three times faster than forests. While global research extensively examines the increasing degradation of wetland health, there exists a significant research gap concerning its impact on livelihoods and the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To address this gap, a systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, utilising data from 1270 database records and 350 research studies spanning 1990 to 2023. The study reveals alarming annual wetland health loss rates ranging from 0.02 % to 3.14 %, driven globally by built-up areas, agricultural expansion, climate change, and pollution. Notably, developing countries and those with lower development indices exhibit the highest rates of wetland health degradation, primarily attributed to agricultural and urban expansion, as well as pollution. The analysis establishes a negative correlation between wetland health degradation rates, driving factors, and key indicators such as the Sustainable Development Goal Index (SDGI) (r = −0.38), Environmental Performance Index (EPI) (r = −0.34), Income Classification (r = −0.42), and Human Development Index (HDI) (r = −0.38). The study emphasizes the imperative of improving economic and socio-ecological conditions to enhance conservation and restoration efforts in wetland areas, thereby contributing to the achievement of SDGs. The interconnectedness of wetland health with broader SDGs underscores the need for targeted interventions. Recommendations include prioritizing comprehensive strategies for environmental and societal well-being, urging policymakers and practitioners to consider the holistic implications of wetland health degradation in their decision-making processes.

Table 2      Objectives Study Area Methodology Annual Loss Rate Reference   To determine how wetland status changed between 1945 and 1985 USA wetlands Detecting shifting areas using the Land Use Land Cover (LULC) map (1945–1985) The overall wetland area was 585.1 km2  in 1945; by 1985, it had decreased to 347 km2 , representing a loss of 1.01 % year. Evers et al. (1992)   To determine how flood management in Argentina affects the disappearance of wetlands Wetlands, Argentina Before the major floods (1987–1988) and after channelization took place (2007), the alterations in the south-eastern Córdoba floodplains were evaluated using a non-supervised classification of satellite pictures. In contrast, Córdoba's channelized area lost 12 % of its ponds, resulting in a 14.7 % decrease in the area that was flooded (11,655 ha) from 1987 to 2007 and the annual rate was 0.60 %. Brandolin et al. (2013)   Examining the alteration in land use around wetlands Gediz Delta wetland, Turkey Utilised modifications in various land use categories between 1963 and 2010 utilising a fast bird satellite picture The wetland's extent was 7216.112 km2  in 1963; by 2010, it had shrunk to 5005.491 km2 . It had a 0.651 % annual loss rate. Bolca et al. (2014)   Determining how land use is changing and how that may affect wild species Kimana wetland, Kenya Analysed land use change trend using data from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images from 1980 to 2013 Annua loss rate was 2.08 % Nyamasyo and Odiara Kihima (2014)   In order to comprehend how coastal wetlands are affected by disturbances over the long term and how land reclamation affects the way those wetlands are managed sustainably Wetland in Pudong District (PD), in Shanghai, China. The rate of shoreline changes or movement was determined using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS, version 4.3) created by the USGS. Over the past 24 years, there has been a 3.8 % yearly average loss of wetland. Wu et al. (2018)   Aimed to look into the spatial distribution and temporal changes of wetlands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) at various watershed sizes between 1970 and 2010 Wetland in QTP, China Landsat TM photos to extract wetland information using the visual interpretation method. To precisely evaluate the overall and per-category classification accuracy, a confusion or error matrix was used (Rooney et al., 2012). Loss rate was averagely 0.95 % Xue et al. (2018)   Evaluating the spatiotemporal shifts of the East Kolkata wetland East-Kolkata wetland, India Wetland transformation maps were created using NDWI and NDBI to track changes over time in the wetland. From 2011 to 2017, the annual rate of wetland loss was 7.34 %. Ghosh et al. (2018)   Evaluating the spatiotemporal shift of the wetland in KMC Wetland near kampalamukono corridor, Uganda Pixel-based comparison method for detecting wetland changes At a loss rate of 1.19 % each year, the wetland area shrunk from 10,140 km2  in 1974 to 5410 km2  in 2013. Wasswa et al. (2019)   Examining how urban development affects wetlands Wetland in South central Chile, Chile Wetland area change is quantified by the LULC map. Using the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), the extent of urban development over the wetland has been estimated. Wetland loss was 10 % between 2004 and 2014, with an annual rate of 1.01 %. Rojas et al. (2019)   To look into recent (post 1990) changes in wetland extent to see if wetland loss rates are still a problem for managing natural resources. Southland, New Zealand Main source of information for determining modifications to wetland extent was a mosaic of satellite images from 1990 to 2012. Landsat TM 1990, Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) 2001, Landsat ETM+ 2003, PALSAR 2009, SPOT 2008, SPOT 2009, and SPOT 2012 were used to create the mosaics. Since 1990, Southland has lost 0.5 % of its wetland area annually, which is comparable to the average rate for the entire world. Robertson et al. (2019)   Examining the demise of the wetland Wetland in Kampala district, Uganda Wetland loss rates and urban agricultural encroachment rates between 1986 and 2016 were determined using Land sat TM data for 1986 and ETM data for 2016. The rate of wetland loss is 2.52 % annually. Kabiri et al. (2020)   Evaluating the effects of urbanisation in Sri Lanka's MMNL region MMNL region, Sri Lanka LULC and spatial metrics are utilised to configure and compose the landscape. (41 % of the area is marshland, and 21 % is mangroves). At the grama niladhari division level (n  = 99), a statistical analysis showed a substantial correlation between the change in population density and the loss of wetland as a result of settlement growth (wetland comprises marshes, mangroves, and water). Annual loss rate 4.1 % Athukorala et al. (2021)   Analysing the spatio-temporal LULC change trend over a 35-year period Wetland in Bahir Dar city, Ethiopia The shifting pattern of LULC map from 1984 to 2019 was created using data from Landsat 5 TM (1984, 1994), 7ETM+ (2004), and 8 OLI (2014, 2019). Wetlands lost area at a rate of 2.16 % between 1984 and 2019, or 0.06 % each year. Assefa et al. (2021)   To advance knowledge of how wetland degradation affects community livelihoods, which will aid in the general management and efficient restoration techniques for long-term management of wetlands in Genina Gganda. Lubigi upper catchment area, uganda Parish development model (local government, 2021) Wetland areas decreased by 3.05 % between 2000 and 2022, making the annual loss rate 0.14 %. Kangume (2022)   To investigate how wetland eco-hydrological status and water quality changed after damming, and to evaluate how that affected the fishermen community's vulnerability to loss of livelihood Lower part of the Tangon river basin, India The eco-hydrological status (EHS) of the wetland was modelled using a variety of machine learning (ML) techniques based on 15 field- and satellite-image-driven indices of transformation. Using a balanced weighted LVI score, the livelihood vulnerability index (LVI) of 45 fishing-heavy villages was calculated. Between 1987 and 2020, human activity caused a loss of wetland area of about 60.55 %, with a yearly loss rate of 1.83 %. Singha and Pal (2023a)   At examining the ecological advantages and causes of the Abaya-Chamo lake-wetland's deterioration. The Abaya-Chamo lake-wetland, Ethiopia The vegetation indices and turbidity of the research area were identified using Landsat data from the past 30 years (1990–2019). For picture interpretation, normalised differential vegetation, water, and turbidity indices were utilised. Between 1990 and 2019, the area lost 48.9 % of its marsh area due to siltation, with an annual loss rate of 1.68 %. Zekarias and Gelaw (2023)   To provide an improved historical baseline to aid in assessments of the effects of wetland loss on Earth system processes, conservation planning to safeguard remaining wetlands, and the ranking of sites for wetland restoration. World In order to create a gridded restoration of wetland loss, we combined data from five major sources. This net loss of wetland area over the world is 21 % (confidence interval 16–23 %), which is less than what earlier extrapolations of data from high-loss regions had predicted. In the middle of the twentieth century, wetland loss rapidly increased and was concentrated in Europe, the United States, and China. 0.07 % annual loss rate. Fluet-Chouinard et al. (2023)   Planning and managing initiatives to maintain a specific ecosystem requires careful observation of changes in land use and land cover. Gediz delta,turkey The processing methodology and algorithms used by the Horizon-2020 wetlands observation service on the basis of satellite were used to create the maps. Declines of 33 % in natural wetland habitats between 1984 and 2020, at a rate of 0.91 % per year. Guelmami et al.

Table 4 Data from the world in order to establish the link between wetland health and livelihood condition.  Table 4      Reference Types of wetlands degradation Types of livelihood loss Findings Countries   Bhatta et al. (2016)  Beel Thatch, fish stocks, fodder and tourism In the last century, roughly 50 % of the world's wetlands have vanished, with Asia losing about 5000 km2  of wetlands annually. The consequences of this decline, as highlighted in our study, are substantial, leading to the loss of crucial ecosystem services and negatively impacting people's livelihoods. These findings suggest that this trend may extend beyond the region and have global implications. India  Bezabih and Mosissa (2017)  Riparian, lakes and swamps Fisheries, agriculture, tourism industry Wetlands in Ethiopia are disappearing or changing more frequently. Wetland loss and degradation in Ethiopia have severe repercussions that directly impact rural families' primary source of income. Ethiopia  Zekarias et al. (2021)  Lake Fish, lumber, firewood, fodder, farmland, recreation, tourism, Using saline water for irrigation will cause chemical land deterioration, and the invasive emboch plant will cause a loss of economic and tourism benefits, a change in the local climate, and a decline in aquatic resources. Ethiopia  Marambanyika et al. (2021) . Riparian Crop farming, pasture for livestock, fish, thatch grass Wetland resources are a major source of food and money for households, but agricultural operations are being negatively impacted by the drought. To cope with the effects, alternate livelihood plans are needed to help regional residents cope with the drought without further stressing the wetland resources. Zimbabwe  Adhya and Banerjee (2022) . Floodplain wetland Fisheries, agriculture, fodder, tourism industry and hunting and gathering The main causes of the wetland's degradation, however, were reportedly factory encroachment and obstruction of its riverine link. As a result, many people's lives and livelihoods were negatively damaged, particularly older inhabitants and landless widows. India  Omairo (2022) . Swamp land Agriculture Wetland degradation caused by agriculture practises has negative effects, including diseases, destruction of homes, conflicts, famine, scarcity of water, inadequate transportation, floods, erosion, loss of biodiversity, global warming, and decreased productivity.

While global research extensively examines the increasing degradation of wetland health, there exists a significant research gap concerning its impact on livelihoods and the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To address this gap, a systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, utilising data from 1270 database records and 350 research studies spanning 1990 to 2023. The study reveals alarming annual wetland health loss rates ranging from 0.02 % to 3.14 %, driven globally by built-up areas, agricultural expansion, climate change, and pollution. Notably, developing countries and those with lower development indices exhibit the highest rates of wetland health degradation, primarily attributed to agricultural and urban expansion, as well as pollution. The analysis establishes a negative correlation between wetland health degradation rates, driving factors, and key indicators such as the Sustainable Development Goal Index (SDGI) (r = −0.38), Environmental Performance Index (EPI) (r = −0.34), Income Classification (r = −0.42), and Human Development Index (HDI) (r = −0.38). The study emphasizes the imperative of improving economic and socio-ecological conditions to enhance conservation and restoration efforts in wetland areas, thereby contributing to the achievement of SDGs. The interconnectedness of wetland health with broader SDGs underscores the need for targeted interventions. Recommendations include prioritizing comprehensive strategies for environmental and societal well-being, urging policymakers and practitioners to consider the holistic implications of wetland health degradation in their decision-making processes.

They have a high level of species richness and play a significant role in supporting life on Earth. Wetlands, which cover only a small portion of the Earth's surface, provide a disproportionately large amount of ecosystem services (Zhu et al., 2022 ; Lahon et al., 2023 ; Chakraborty et al., 2023 ). These services include the provision of resources like fish, timber, and medicinal plants, support for agriculture (Altieri et al., 2022 ), carbon sequestration (Nag et al., 2023 ), water and air quality regulation (Imdad et al., 2022 ; Mahato et al., 2023 ), climate regulation, shoreline stabilisation, flood mitigation, habitat maintenance, waste treatment, and utilisation for cultural and recreational pursuits (Mitra et al., 2022 ; Ye et al., 2022 ; Zekarias and Gelaw, 2023 ). Unfortunately, wetlands have experienced decline and deterioration due to various factors such as drainage, conversion for other land uses, pollution from agriculture and industry, invasive species, altered hydrological patterns, and human disturbances (Brain and Prosser, 2022 ; Jamal et al., 2023 ; Chakraborty et al., 2023 ). Both natural and human-related causes contribute to wetland loss or degradation, resulting in the depletion of ecological values and the loss of livelihoods for communities dependent on wetland resources (Vinayachandran et al., 2022 ; Raimi et al., 2022 ; Singh et al., 2023a ). The expansion of crop farming near wetlands has increased in recent years owing to population growth, climate change, globalisation, and policy changes (Pal et al., 2022 ; Agostoni et al., 2023 ; Maru et al., 2023 ). Numerous studies highlight the crucial function of ecosystems, or natural capital, in enhancing access to other forms of capital, leading to poverty reduction and increased resilience to the influences of global change in climate (Carmen et al., 2022 ; Phuong et al., 2023 ; Akamani, 2023 ). The adverse effects of ecological challenges, such as change in climate and degradation of ecosystem, have had a severe impact on the livelihoods of communities reliant on ecosystems (Kadykalo et al., 2022 ; Bennett et al., 2023 ; Ramaano, 2023 ). These impacts include reduced agricultural productivity, limited livelihood opportunities, heightened poverty levels, and diminished the ability to take advantage of opportunities at different scales (Huq et al., 2020 ; Marambanyika et al., 2021 ; Birkmann et al., 2022 ). While diversifying livelihoods is often suggested as a strategy to address these challenges and unpredictability, it is crucial to measure vulnerability of livelihood within the broader framework of sustainable livelihood planning and ecosystem-based adaptation (Angula et al., 2021 ; Sultana et al., 2023 ; Vikas and Hari, 2023 ). An important prerequisite for livelihood development based on ecosystem is a comprehensive perception of the qualitative and quantitative association between the livelihood system and the ecosystem in a specified social-ecological context (Adams et al., 2020 ; Gupta and Dube, 2021 ). The degradation of wetlands and the resulting threats to livelihood sustainability are major concerns for many governments, particularly in developing countries (Sam and Zabbey, 2018 ; Zekarias et al., 2021 ; Maltby, 2022 ). The increasing population and rural poverty have contributed to the deprivation of wetland ecosystems (Phethi and Gumbo, 2019 ; Thamaga et al., 2022 ). These ecosystems are crucial for conservation and sustainable management, given their rich biodiversity (Sarkar et al., 2020 ; Xu et al., 2020 ). Moreover, wetlands play a central character in achieving various Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs ), including improving quality of water, sustainable management of resource, competent resource consumption, zero hunger, eminence education, clean water and sanitation, decent work and economic growth, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, and climate action (Conallin et al., 2019 ; Zahed et al., 2022 ; Bridgewater, 2021 ). Therefore, there is a need to strike an equilibrium between wetland conversion, sustainable utilisation, human well-being, and ecosystem service conservation, especially in developing countries where wetlands are deteriorating rapidly (Watson et al., 2019 ; Hoque et al., 2022 ). Nature-based solutions (NBS ) is a recently introduced term that is closely linked to wetlands (Huang et al., 2019 ; Anderson and Renaud, 2021 ; Martín-Dato et al., 2023 ). It refers to utilising nature to address a wide variety of global environmental and social concerns, including change in climate and water pollution. NBS relies on the natural functions of ecosystems, such as the biological treatment of groundwater contaminants, which is part of the natural attenuation processes (Song et al., 2019 ; Hale et al., 2022 ; Franchi et al., 2022 ). Wetlands are renowned for providing valuable ecosystem services, making them ideal for employing as nature-based solutions to discourse various environmental, economic and social issues (Castellar et al., 2021 ; Agaton and Guila, 2023 ). But unfortunately, wetland areas have been experiencing a continuous and rapid decline worldwide, although the exact extent of this loss remains uncertain. While certain regions like the Europe and US have managed to reduce the wetland health degradation rate, many areas are still facing significant losses (Junk et al., 2013 ; Xu et al., 2019 ). Nevertheless, the annual economic value of wetland ecosystem services is approximated to be $26.4 trillion worldwide, contributing >20 % to the overall value of ecosystem services globally (Ameli and Creed, 2019 ; Ruso et al., 2019 ; Huang et al., 2019b ), surpassing even coral reefs and terrestrial forests. This underscores the importance of assessing how to effectively utilise wetlands as cost-effective and sustainable nature-based solutions to address existing and future challenges. The co-occurrence analysis reveals evolving trends in wetland health research, with distinct keyword emphases in different years. Notably, the increasing attention to wetland management practices, climate change impacts on coastal wetlands, and the driving forces behind conservation efforts reflects the dynamic and multidimensional nature of research in this field over the examined period (Fig. 1  ). The sustainable utilisation of wetlands and their accompanying ecosystems is influenced by various interconnected aspects, including fast population growth, increase of agriculture, utilisation of chemical inputs, irrigation practises, invasive species, variations in societal behaviours, infrastructure development, urbanisation, overgrazing, unrestricted access to resources, drought, climate change, and policy changes (Zekarias et al., 2021 ; Prokopová et al., 2019 ; Li et al., 2023a, 2023b ). Specific threats to wetland biodiversity and services include altering water flow patterns, runoff from agricultural and urban areas, water extraction from lakes, high evaporation rates, recurrent siltation, and pollution (Zekarias et al., 2020 ; Kumar et al., 2021 ; Sarkar and Maji, 2022 ). However, the significance of these factors in degrading wetland functions and services, as well as the livelihoods of people dependent on wetlands, can vary across various regions (Aazami and Shanazi, 2020 ; Das and Bhattacharjee, 2020 ; Das et al., 2022 ). Despite the critical importance of wetland ecosystems and the services they offer to both people and nature, policymakers often fail to fully appreciate the interconnectedness between wetlands and livelihoods (Kakuba and Kanyamurwa, 2021 ; Hidayat et al., 2022 ; Singha, 2023 ). Developing effective policies and management strategies for wetlands necessitates a comprehensive understanding of how natural and human-induced factors impact wetland ecosystem functions and how the reduction of wetland resources affects people's incomes (Roy-Basu et al., 2020 ; Samiee-Zafarghandy, 2023 ). It is also crucial to comprehend how individuals make decisions regarding mistreatment of resource and how sociocultural and policy factors influence those conclusions. The rate of degradation in wetland health and the underlying processes are not solely determined by the regional or local direct sources stated earlier. The overall development, encompassing both environmental and societal aspects, of a nation is influenced by various socio-ecological conditions. This raises the question of how socio-ecological conditions can contribute to wetland health degradation, considering wetlands as a natural capital, and what factors are responsible for this degradation. This review article aims to address this question by examining the association between socio-ecological situations and the causes of wetland health degradation. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP ) defines the Human Development Index (HDI ) as a succinct indicator that gauges a nation's advancement in terms of key dimensions such as education, life expectancy and standard of living (Zeng et al., 2020 ; Jin et al., 2020 ; Dai et al., 2024 ). Countries with high HDI tend to have well-developed healthcare systems, strong educational institutions, and high-income levels (Roghani and Panahi, 2021 ; Singh et al., 2023b ; Zhang et al., 2023 ). These factors can significantly impact the rate of wetland health degradation. The Environmental Performance Index (EPI ), established by the World Economic Forum in 2002, is an international ranking system that assesses a country's environmental health and vitality. A good EPI score indicates that a country is mindful of growth and avoids activities that harm wetlands, which are crucial components of ecosystems (Hajian and Kashani, 2021 ; Ghosh and Pal, 2023 ). The SDGs outline global efforts to create a healthier and mores sustainable future. These goals discourse critical challenges such as inequality, poverty, environmental degradation, climate change and justice (Varotsos and Cracknell, 2020 ; Gupta and Lebel, 2020 ). Several SDGs, including (SDG 1) poverty eradication, (SDG 2) zero hunger, (SDG 6) clean water and sanitation, (SDG 11) sustainable cities and communities, (SDG 13) climate action, and (SDG 14) life below water, indirectly and directly relate to wetlands. Therefore, different countries are increasingly focused on achieving higher SDG scores, which can contribute to the conservation and sustainable management of wetland resources (Chen et al., 2022 ; Jaramillo et al., 2019 ). Numerous studies have emphasized the important role of wetlands in supporting livelihoods, providing a strong basis for this hypothesis (McCartney et al., 2015 ; Aazami and Shanazi, 2020 ; Kakuba and Kanyamurwa, 2021 ). Livelihoods are intimately tied to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which represent a core aspect of sustainable development (Birkmann et al., 2022 ). Essentially, livelihoods encompass the means and resources necessary for individuals and communities to secure the basic necessities of life, including food, water, shelter, and income (Esteves et al., 2024 ). The achievement of the SDGs, which aim to address global challenges such as poverty, hunger, inequality, and environmental degradation, heavily depends on ensuring sustainable livelihoods (Lile et al., 2023 ). The SDGs explicitly recognize the importance of livelihoods by including targets related to poverty eradication (Goal 1), food security (Goal 2), decent work and economic growth (Goal 8), and sustainable cities and communities (Goal 11) (Elamon et al., 2023 ). Sustainable livelihood contributes to these goals by fostering economic empowerment, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability (Mahato et al., 2023 ). Thus, the relationship between livelihoods and SDGs underscores the interconnectedness of the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. Previous literature has explored various aspects of wetland health, including the causes of degradation on different continents (Xu et al., 2019 ; Wen et al., 2024 ; Du et al., 2024 ), the ecosystem services offer by wetlands (Janse et al., 2019 ; Mandishona and Knight, 2022 ), and nonmarket valuation studies (Macaskill and Lloyd-Smith, 2022 ). However, a comprehensive investigation focusing on the spatial variations in the wetland health degradation rate and its connection to livelihood conditions, SDGs, environmental performance, income classification, and human development across countries is lacking. To address this gap in research, this review aims to inspect the spatial variations in the rate of wetland health degradation worldwide and identify the primary causes behind them. Additionally, the paper intends to elucidate the impact of degraded wetland health on livelihood conditions and its implications for achieving the SDGs.  2 Methods 2.1 Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis-guided methodology and meta-analysis procedures The production of this review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines (Page et al., 2021 ). In the realm of systematic reviews, a common challenge lies in the lack of awareness regarding shared guidelines for ensuring replicability and scientific adequacy. PRISMA addresses this by offering a standard and peer-accepted methodology, supported by a guideline checklist, which was rigorously implemented in this paper (Moher et al., 2015 ; Pussegoda et al., 2017 ). This meticulous approach not only contributes to the quality assurance of the revision process but also enhances its replicability. A comprehensive review protocol was developed, delineating criteria for article selection, search strategy, data extraction, and data analysis procedures. The study's metadata was obtained through Clarivate Analytics' Web of Science (WOS ) platform, with the primary dataset sourced from the Core Collection (WOSCC ) database. The literature search was conducted using relevant keywords and databases to identify publications related to wetland degradation, its impacts on livelihoods, and its implications for SDGs. Publications were screened based on their relevance to the research objectives, geographic scope, and publication year. Studies that did not directly address the focal topics or lacked sufficient empirical evidence were excluded from the study. The meta-analysis section comprised five specific tasks. Firstly, quantification of the spatio-temporal frequency of publications on wetland health degradation and associated procedures aimed to investigate shifts in research publication trends. Secondly, an examination of changing patterns in international research collaboration focused on key countries involved. Fig. 2   meticulously details all the reporting items essential for the systematic review, including the number of publications considered in this study. In this study, data on economic and socio-ecological parameters were collected from worldwide accepted agencies, as outlined in Table 1  . The purpose was to establish a correlation between the degradation of wetland health and the status of livelihoods.  2.2 Estimation of wetland health degradation rate and selection of drivers The quantification of the wetland health degradation rate varied across the published articles, and the time frames of the studies were not consistent. To address this issue, annual rates of wetland health degradation were calculated to provide a standardised measure. The annual rate of wetland degradation was estimated by dividing the entire area of lost wetlands by the number of years over which the loss occurred. From the available literature, the sources contributing to wetland health degradation were recognized, with a focus on the foremost factors. To highlight the leading drivers of wetland health degradation, the frequency of articles related to these recognized sources was examined and visualised through spatial mapping, offering a visual representation of the primary drivers.  2.3 Methods adopted for computing the parameters in relation with livelihood However, in the current study, we did not compute the selected socio-ecological and economic indicators pertaining to livelihood. Instead, we gathered information on these indicators from reputable sources such as the World Economic Forum, the World Bank reports and the United Nations Development Programme as indicated in Table 1 . Nevertheless, we have provided a brief overview of the fundamental methodologies employed to calculate these indices in order to provide an understanding of their computation process. We gathered data on various ecological and socio-economic indicators, including the Sustainable Development Goal Index (SDGI ), the Environmental Performance Index (EPI), Income classification, and the Human Development Index (HDI). The HDI is calculated by taking the mean (geometric) of three normalised indices (life expectancy, education, and income) using Eqs. (1) to (6) . The HDI value ranges between 0 (minimum theoretically) and 1 (maximum theoretically). To compute the Environmental Performance Index (EPI), we considered forty performance indicators across eleven issue categories. SDGI: Countries are assigned a score based on a variety of factors, and then ranked according to their scores, which reflects the extent to which they have accomplished all 17 SDGs. The overall score represents the percentage of SDGs achieved, with a score of 100 indicating the fulfilment of all SDGs. EPI: The EPI 2022 score evaluates the effectiveness of state policies in achieving environmental performance. Factors such as environmental health, ecosystem vitality, and climate change performance are taken into account when determining the EPI score. A scorecard generated by the EPI that assesses a country's environmental performance and offers valuable guidance for countries seeking to transition in the direction of a sustainable future. Income Classification: Each year, at the start of the World Bank fiscal year on July 1, countries undergo categorization based on Gross National Income (GNI) per capita statistics from the previous calendar year. This classification utilises the World Bank Atlas technique. For the fiscal year 2023, the GNI per capita data for 2021 is employed to determine the country's classification. The global regions are then divided into four groups: low income, lower middle income, upper middle income, and high income. HDI: In the 2010 edition of the Human Development Report by the UNDP (Mylevaganam, 2017 ), a novel approach was implemented to compute the HDI (Mazumdar, 2003 ). This approach involved the utilisation of three indices (Mazumdar, 2003 ).(1) Life Expectancy Index  LEI  = LE − 20  85 − 20      (2) Mean Year of Schooling  MYSI  = MYS 15     (3) Expected Year of Schooling  EYSI  = EYS 18     (4) Education Index  EI  = MYSI + EYSI  2     (5) Income Index  II  = In GNI PC   − In 100   In 75000  − In 100       (6) HDI = LEI . EI . II  3      (Here, LEI  indicating Life Expectancy Index, EI  is Education Index, and II  represent Income Index) The calculation of the life expectancy component of the HDI takes into account the age ranges of 20 years and 85 years. In terms of the educational index, two indices are considered: the Mean Years of Schooling Index (MYSI ) and the Expected Years of Schooling Index (EYSI ). The MYSI evaluates the duration of education for individuals aged 25 years and older, while the EYSI estimates the projected years of schooling for children starting at the age of five. The education index is computed by combining two normalised indices, each of which has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 15 or 18 years, respectively. The standard of living is measured by the Gross National Income per person (GNIpc ), which ranges from $100 (PPP) to $75,000 (PPP).  2.4 Relationship between wetland health degradation and livelihood condition To examine the link between the state of livelihood and the degradation of wetland health, we analysed multiple publications and explored the correlation between various socio-ecological and economic factors associated with livelihood. We employed Pearson's method for calculating correlation, considering the normal distribution of the data and the interval nature of the variables. Statistical tests were conducted to determine the significance of the correlations at the 0.05 and 0.01 levels. Additionally, a correlation matrix plot was utilised to show the associations between these variables. The study investigated how wetland transformation occurs in different countries, taking into account the specific socio-ecological conditions of each country. The frequency of publications was assessed based on various identified causes of wetland health degradation, including built-up expansion, agricultural encroachment, pollutants, climate change, and others. To evaluate the drivers in relation to the Human Development Index, the publications were categorised into four groups: very high HDI (>0.8), high HDI (0.7–0.799), medium HDI (0.55–0.699), and low HDI (<0.55). The publication frequency was then calculated for each cluster. Similar analyses were conducted for other socio-ecological variables such as the SDG index, environmental performance index, and income classification. The classification criteria are provided in Table 1 . A flowchart illustrating the sequential methods used to achieve the objective was created (Fig. 3  ).   3 Results and discussion 3.1 Rate of wetland health degradation 3.1.1 Wetland health transformation The rate of wetland loss worldwide shows significant variations among different countries and continents. In Africa, countries such as Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia, and Nigeria have experienced relatively high rates of wetland loss, ranging from 0.70 % to 4.42 % annually (Zekarias and Gelaw, 2023 ) (Fig. 4 a ). Ethiopia, in particular, has witnessed a remarkably high rate of wetland degradation within the African continent (Zekarias and Gelaw, 2023 ) (Fig. 4 a) (Table 2  ). Moving on to Asia, the countries examined for wetland loss include India, Bangladesh, and China (Let and Pal, 2023 ) (Fig. 4 a) (Table 2 ). Among these, Bangladesh has recorded a higher rate of wetland loss (Ghosh and Pal, 2023 ). On the other hand, the United States and Canada have shown comparatively lower rates of wetland loss, both below 1 % per year (Campbell et al., 2022 ). South America, specifically Brazil and Argentina, has exhibited moderate to high rates of wetland degradation (Riquetti et al., 2022 ) (Table 2 ). The rate of wetland degradation also varies depending on the location of the wetlands, with continental and coastal zones exhibiting diverse rates of loss (Nevermann et al., 2023 ). Countries like the US, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom have higher rates of coastal wetland loss compared to continental wetlands (Xu et al., 2019 ; Yang et al., 2022a, 2022b ). Conversely, countries like India, Tanzania, Nigeria and Bangladesh have experienced more wetland degradation in continental zones than in coastal zones (Dryden et al., 2021 ; Onyango and Yahya, 2022 ; Jia et al., 2023 ). Some countries, such as Argentina, and Brazil have shown similar rates of loss in both continental and coastal wetlands (Mancuso et al., 2020 ; Let and Pal, 2023 ; Liang et al., 2024 ). Fig. 4 b illustrates the rates of wetland loss categorised into different zones during two phases. In Phase I (1990–2007), the majority of wetland degradation occurred in the “Low” zone, accounting for 85.5 % of the total loss. The “Moderate” zone experienced a lower rate of wetland degradation at 57.2 %. The “High” zone had the lowest rate of wetland loss, with only 20.87 % of the total loss happening in this zone during Phase I (Fig. 4 b). In Phase II (2008 – May 2023), there was a notable shift in the distribution of wetland loss. The rate of wetland loss in the “Low” zone decreased significantly to 14.5 %. Meanwhile, the “Moderate” zone experienced an increase in the wetland degradation rate to 42.8 %. The most substantial change occurred in the “High” zone, where the wetland degradation rate significantly rose to 79.13 % (Fig. 7 b). Overall, comparing Phase I and Phase II, there was a shift towards higher rates of wetland loss, particularly in the “Moderate” and “High” zones. This indicates an increased level of wetland loss in these zones during Phase II compared to Phase I, while the rate of loss in the “Low” zone decreased.  3.1.2 Drivers of wetland health degradation Table 3   provides an overview of the factors contributing to wetland loss globally, with reference to multiple literature sources. Over fifteen causes were identified including agriculture, urbanisation, industrialization, tourism, aquaculture, grassland expansion, dam construction, climate change, water quality changes, groundwater depletion, pollution, illegal hunting, forest fires and poaching, and mining activities. Lead pollution emerged as a significant driver of water and soil quality deterioration, as well as aquatic ecosystem pollution (Campos and Abrantes, 2021 ; Campanale et al., 2022 ; Chen et al., 2024 ). Household chemicals were also identified as contributors to environmental pollution (Mohana et al., 2022 ; Khalil et al., 2022 ). Microcontaminants like pesticides, biocides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products were found to contaminate neighboring environmental components (Ahmad and Imran, 2022 ). Among the various causes reported, four dominant drivers of wetland loss were identified. In order of significance, they are: (1) increase of built-up areas, (2) increase of agricultural land, (3) pollution, (4) climate change, and (5) dam construction (Table 3 ) (Fig. 5 a ). When considering spatial patterns, agriculture increase, built-up area expansion, and pollution were observed primarily in developing countries such as China, India and Brazil (Fig. 5 a). On the other hand, climate change was recognized as a significant driver of wetland loss in developed and developing countries also, although it is worth noting that this distinction is not always universally applicable across all countries within their respective economic domains. Exceptions to these patterns have also been reported. Fig. 5 b highlights the changing dynamics of the major drivers of wetland degradation over the two phases. The increase of built-up areas, the expansion of agricultural land, pollution, and climate change were identified as significant drivers, with their relative importance shifting between the phases.   3.2 Influence of wetland health degradation and livelihood condition An attempt was made to examine the impact of degraded wetland health on livelihood conditions, considering four socio-ecological parameters. This investigation utilised a correlation matrix (Fig. 6  ) and findings from various publications (Table 4  ). Although an extensive literature explores the relationship between wetland conditions and livelihood status, the studies featured in Table 4  were selectively chosen for their direct relevance to this investigation's specific research objectives and analytical approach. These carefully curated publications provided focused insights into the intricate linkages between distinct wetland types, varying forms of livelihood impacts, and the underlying mechanisms driving these connections across diverse geographical contexts. Rather than an exhaustive compilation, Table 4  represents a strategic selection of influential works that effectively illustrate the nuanced relationships between wetland degradation, livelihood status, and the consequential socioeconomic implications for dependent communities (Table 4 ). The correlation matrix and the quantified rate of wetland degradation determined the extent of effect and the significance levels among the parameters (Fig. 6 ). A negative relationship was discovered between the average wetland degradation rate (−0.38) and SDGI (Seifollahi-Aghmiuni et al., 2019 ; Xu et al., 2022 ) and indicating that focused efforts in the direction of reaching SDGs can decrease resource loss, including wetland degradation. The EPI was also negatively correlated with the rate of wetland loss (Papadimitriou et al., 2020 ; Wendling et al., 2022 ;) (−0.34) at a statistically significant level of 0.01 (Fig. 6 ). This suggests that countries that have invested heavily in improving their environmental performance tend to experience lower rates of wetland loss. Furthermore, the income classification exhibited a negative influence on the wetland degradation rate (−0.42), indicating that economically advanced nations are better equipped to minimise wetland degradation. Previous studies (Langergraber and Dotro, 2019 ; Wang et al., 2021 ) support this finding. Lastly, a negative correlation between the HDI and the rate of wetland loss (−0.38) was detected at a significance level of 0.05 (Fig. 6 ), suggesting that countries with higher HDI tend to experience lower rates of wetland health degradation. Therefore, enhancing HDI could be a comprehensive approach to protecting wetlands and mitigating their loss (Aydin-Kandemir and Demir, 2022 ).  3.3 Impact of wetland health degradation on Sustainable development goals The degradation of wetland health stands as a pivotal challenge with far-reaching implications for the attainment of SDGs (Cumming et al., 2017 ; Evers et al., 2017 ) (Fig. 7  ). The intricate interplay between wetland ecosystems and the broader sustainability agenda unfolds with nuanced insights and potential future prospects. Wetlands, acknowledged as providers of essential ecosystem services, play a crucial role in addressing multiple SDGs. The findings of this study accentuate the significance of wetlands in contributing to SDGs related to clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), climate action (SDG 13), life on land (SDG 15), and sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11) (Seifollahi-Aghmiuni et al., 2019 ; Janssen et al., 2021 ). These ecological contributions underscore the irreplaceable value of wetlands in fostering environmental health, biodiversity conservation, and the well-being of human societies. A new dimension emerges as the study reveals a negative correlation between the SDGI (Seifollahi-Aghmiuni et al., 2019 ; Xu et al., 2022 ; Li and Fan, 2024 ) and the average wetland degradation rate. This correlation unveils a potential synergy – concerted efforts directed towards achieving SDGs can contribute significantly to reducing the loss of valuable wetland resources. The SDGI becomes not just a metric for gauging progress in broader sustainability goals but a potential lever for wetland conservation. Preserving and restoring wetland ecosystems are identified as potent strategies that can resonate with the overarching goals of SDGs (Tickner et al., 2020 ; Yin et al., 2023a ; Yin et al., 2023b ). This holistic approach signifies the interconnectedness of environmental conservation with broader sustainability initiatives. The conservation of wetlands is not merely an isolated endeavor but an integral component that, when integrated into the SDG agenda, amplifies the effectiveness of sustainability initiatives. The nexus between wetland health and SDGs gains further depth as the study emphasizes the safeguarding of critical resources and the promotion of sustainable development. The imperative to integrate wetland conservation strategies into the SDG agenda is underscored, offering a pathway towards not only achieving environmental sustainability but also contributing to the long-term well-being of ecosystems and human livelihoods (Bridgewater et al., 2015 ; Johnson et al., 2019 ; Bawa et al., 2021 ). New insights into the future prospects of wetland conservation within the SDG framework unfold with promising possibilities. The negative correlation between SDGI and wetland degradation rate implies that as global efforts advance towards achieving sustainability goals, there exists a potential for positive impacts on wetland health. This opens avenues for exploring innovative policies, cross-sectoral collaborations, and targeted interventions that align with the broader SDG agenda. Moreover, the study prompts a reevaluation of the role of wetlands in addressing climate action (SDG 13). Wetlands, as carbon sinks, can play a more prominent role in mitigating climate change impacts. Recognizing wetlands as integral components of climate resilience and carbon sequestration aligns with global efforts to combat climate change. Future prospects could involve a deeper integration of wetland conservation strategies into climate action initiatives, fostering a holistic approach towards environmental sustainability. The study's emphasis on sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11) introduces a novel perspective for urban planning. The integration of wetland conservation into urban development strategies becomes crucial, considering the often-overlooked importance of wetlands in urban areas. Future prospects could involve reshaping urban planning paradigms to incorporate wetlands as green infrastructure, thereby contributing to the creation of sustainable, resilient cities. As we gaze into the future, wetland conservation stands poised as an integral component of global sustainability efforts. The study's findings underscore the need for innovative approaches, community engagement, and international collaboration to address the ongoing loss and degradation of wetlands. Future research could delve into refining wetland conservation strategies, identifying new indicators for assessing wetland health within the SDG framework, and exploring novel technologies for monitoring and managing wetland ecosystems.   4 Conclusions This study emphasized the critical importance of understanding spatial variations in wetland health degradation and their implications for livelihoods and sustainable development goals (SDGs). Conducted with rigorous adherence to PRISMA guidelines, our review spans from 1990 to 2023, revealing significant insights that demand the attention of policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders. The analysis highlights that wetland health degradation has a profound impact on the livelihoods of communities worldwide, with developed countries showing lower degradation rates due to stronger socio-ecological and economic indicators. In contrast, developing and least developed countries face higher degradation rates, underscoring the need for a holistic and inclusive approach to conservation efforts. This wide-ranging assessment of wetland loss patterns, drivers, and implications reveals regional discrepancies and temporal fluctuations in wetland degradation. The primary drivers identified include urbanisation, agricultural expansion, pollution, and climate change, which collectively highlight the multifaceted challenges of wetland preservation. The relationship between wetland conservation and the SDGs underscores the interdependence of environmental health and broader sustainability objectives. Effective wetland conservation strategies are integral to the SDG agenda, offering a critical pathway to address the complex challenges of wetland degradation. A comprehensive approach to conservation not only enhances sustainability initiatives but also underscores the essential role of wetlands in promoting environmental health, biodiversity, and human well-being. The findings advocate for prioritizing innovative policies, collaborative partnerships, and community engagement to preserve and restore wetland ecosystems. Such efforts are vital to ensuring the long-term resilience and vitality of wetlands, thereby preserving their invaluable contributions to global sustainability and human well-being. Notably, the study reveals that certain developing nations have emerged as prominent research hubs over time, reflecting a shifting landscape in wetland health research. This shift emphasizes the need for inclusive global collaboration to tackle the challenges associated with wetland health degradation effectively. Local approaches to wetland resource management in developing countries often face limitations, highlighting the importance of driver-centric strategies. Tailoring interventions to specific threats, such as releasing ecological flows to preserve wetlands threatened by water diversion or controlling pollution for contaminated wetlands, is crucial. Additionally, considering socio-ecological and economic factors at regional, national, and global levels is essential to protect wetlands from harmful human interventions. One of the significant findings of this study is the correlation between wetland health degradation rates and indicators such as the SDGI, EPI, Income, and HDI. Improving these indicators is crucial for reducing wetland health degradation, demonstrating the interconnectedness of societal well-being, economic prosperity, and environmental health. This study's innovative aspect lies in its emphasis on international planning for wetland conservation. By highlighting the importance of global collaboration and considering socio-ecological and economic factors at multiple levels, the study advocates for a comprehensive approach that minimizes reliance on regional-level planning and offers a nuanced perspective for guiding future conservation strategies. However, the study is not without limitations, providing opportunities for future research. Expanding the literature sample to include a more diverse array of nations and increasing the sample size for each nation could enhance the study's conclusions, offering a more robust foundation for broader inferences. Future research could delve deeper into specific regional nuances and variations, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of wetland health dynamics.
