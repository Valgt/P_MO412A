                  Improvements in prosperity, health, nutrition, and standards of living is a major aspiration for all human beings and nations. The United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were formulated to combine imperatives of economic development with environmental sustainability. Formulated and accepted in 2015, the SDGs comprise 17 goals with 169 targets, to be achieved by 2030. For the field of automatic control, the IFAC is the main international organization and therefore represents the appropriate forum to engage with these goals. In this paper, we present a framework that can be used to develop systematic ways of thinking about how the automatic control community in general, and the IFAC in particular, can contribute to the progress towards the achievement of the UN SDGs.

INTRODUCTION On 29 November 2016, United Nations (UN) Secretary General Ban Ki-moon addressed the Summit on Science and Technology for Sustainable Development Goals at the New York Academy of Sciences. He stated, â€œToday I would like to offer ten ways in which I hope the scientific community will be an even bigger part of this effort. First, I ask you to truly embrace the objectives of the 2030 Agenda and the landmark Paris Agreement on climate change. . . .We also need your innovations and climate-friendly solutions to help further reduce the costs of renewable energy. . . . Sixth, scientists can help us address other inequalities, not just the technology gap. . . . Seventh, I call on you to help us to seize the remarkable potential of the data revolution. . . . Entrepreneurs and innovators depend on your groundbreaking research to bring sustainable solutions to the market. City planners and infrastructure developers are hungry for your help in building livable urban environments.â€� The Secretary General Ki-moon was challenging the sci- ence and engineering community to help achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These SDGs were adopted by the UN at a summit meeting in New York on 25 September 2015 [UN (2015b)]. They replaced and expanded on previous development goals, namely, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). These MDGs were adopted by the UN in 2000. In the 2015 report [UN (2015a)] on the progress on MDGs, it was stated that, â€œAs we reach the end of the MDG period, the world community has reason to celebrate. . . . The data and analysis presented in this report prove that, with targeted interventions, sound strategies, adequate resources and po- litical will, even the poorest countries can make dramatic and unprecedented progress. The report also acknowledges uneven achievements and shortfalls in many areas. The work is not complete, and it must continue in the new development era.â€� The movement towards defining SDGs began at the UN Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro in 2012. The objective of the conference was to produce a set of global goals that met the urgent environmental, political and economic challenges. In a follow-up paper, Griggs et al. (2013) wrote, â€œAs mounting research shows, the stable functioning of Earth systems â€” including the atmosphere, oceans, forests, waterways, biodiversity and biogeochemical cycles â€” is a prerequisite for a thriving global society. With the human population set to rise to 9 billion by 2050, definitions of sustainable development must be revised to include the security of people and the planet.â€� The SDGs were finalized and adopted in 2015. With the notion of â€œleave nobody behind,â€� the SDGs aim to combine goals of economic development, poverty reduction, and peace with environmental sustainability. They represent a global agenda for the future of humanity. The main purpose of this paper is to present an initial analysis of how the IFAC community is contributing to the SDGs, and to recommend how it can further contribute towards their realization. We believe that the automation and control community has a large and compelling op- portunity to help the global human society move forward on a worthy set of goals. We stress that our analysis is preliminary and much more systematic work remains to be done. We hope that this analysis and recommendations for future efforts will be useful to the IFAC community. 2.

UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS As m ntioned above, UN SDGs were formulated i 2015 as the global development agenda, with a vision that extended to 2030. Th y were adopted on September 25, 154 Pramod P. Khargonekar  et al. / IFAC PapersOnLine 58-3 (2024) 153â€“158 2015 by the UN General Assembly [UN (2015b)]. With the title, â€œTransforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Developmentâ€�, the SDGs combined the im- perative of economic development with environmental sus- tainability. We quote a few sentences from the SDG vision that are particularly relevant to our thinking: â€œA world with equitable and universal access to quality education at all levels, to health care and social protection, where physical, mental and social well-being are assured. A world where we reaffirm our commitments regarding the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation and where there is improved hygiene; and where food is sufficient, safe, affordable and nutritious. A world where human habitats are safe, resilient and sustainable and where there is uni- versal access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy. . . .We envisage a world in which every country enjoys sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth and decent work for all. A world in which consumption and production patterns and use of all natural resources â€“ from air to land, from rivers, lakes and aquifers to oceans and seas â€“ are sustainable.â€� There are 17 SDGs, each of which has several specific â€œtar- gets,â€� with each target including one or more measurement â€œindicators.â€� These 17 goals are: (1) End poverty in all its forms everywhere. (2) End hunger, achieve food security and improved nu- trition and promote sustainable agriculture. (3) Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. (4) Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. (5) Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. (6) Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. (7) Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. (8) Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable eco- nomic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all. (9) Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation. (10) Reduce inequality within and among countries. (11) Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. (12) Ensure sustainable consumption and production pat- terns. (13) Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. (14) Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. (15) Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of ter- restrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, com- bat desertification, and halt and reverse land degra- dation and halt biodiversity loss. (16) Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustain- able development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. (17) Strengthen the means of implementation and revi- talize the global partnership for sustainable develop- ment. There are 169 targets accompanying these goals. It was recognized quite early that formulation and agree- ment on global goals was a novel approach to the difficult challenge of global governance, given the sovereignty of nation-states [Biermann et al. (2017)]. SDGs were logical successors to â€œMillenium Development Goals (MDGs)â€� developed by the UN in 2000 with a target year of 2015. Neither MDGs nor SDGs are legally binding. In this sense, they represent common aspirations of various na- tions across the planet to lift billions of people out of poverty and poor life outcomes without damages to the environment. The year 2023 marked approximately the midpoint of the journey towards the 2030 target year. The UN released a somber report [UN (2023)] on the progress towards the achievement of the 17 SDGs. In releasing this midpoint assessment, the UN Secretary General AntoÌ�nio Guterres stated: â€œUnless we act now, the 2030 Agenda will become an epitaph for a world that might have been.â€� The report states: â€œEarly efforts after the Sustainable Development Goals were adopted produced some favorable trends. Ex- treme poverty and child mortality rates continued to fall. Inroads were made against such diseases as HIV and hep- atitis. Some targets for gender equality were seeing positive results. Electricity access in the poorest countries was on the rise, and the share of renewables in the energy mix was increasing. Globally, unemployment was back to levels not seen since before the 2008 financial crisis. The proportion of waters under national jurisdiction covered by marine protected areas more than doubled in five years. But it is clear now that too much of that progress was fragile and most of it was too slow. In the past three years, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the war in Ukraine and climate related disasters have exacerbated already faltering progress.â€� Measurement and tracking of progress on the SDGs and associated indicators has been a major challenge. In the early years of the SDGs, there was a lack of standardized metrics, methodologies, and monitoring mechanisms as well as the required datasets for assessing a substantial subset of indicators [Lu et al. (2015); UN (2023)]. Since that time, appreciable progress has been made. By now, most of the indicators have well-established methodolo- gies, and it is possible to track progress across nations. 3. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSFORMATIONS OF HUMAN-NATURAL-TECHNOLOGICAL SYSTEMS There are complex relationships between economic growth, technological innovation, and environmental sustainabil- ity. In the past, economic growth has often come at the expense of environmental damage. In recent years, how- ever, there are new visions and approaches [Mazzucato and Perez (2023)] to link innovation-led economic growth to progress on environmental sustainability. These new approaches are aligned with the SDGs. The achievement of the 17 SDGs is intricately dependent upon changes to the human, natural, and technological systems that support our human civilization. The SDGs also involve trade-offs that require careful analysis and  Pramod P. Khargonekar  et al. / IFAC PapersOnLine 58-3 (2024) 153â€“158 155 2015 by the UN General Assembly [UN (2015b)].

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSFORMATIONS OF HUMAN-NATURAL-TECHNOLOGICAL SYSTEMS There are complex relationships between economic growth, technological innovation, and environmental sustainabil- ity. In the past, economic growth has often come at the expense of environmental damage. In recent years, how- ever, there are new visions and approaches [Mazzucato and Perez (2023)] to link innovation-led economic growth to progress on environmental sustainability. These new approaches are aligned with the SDGs. The achievement of the 17 SDGs is intricately dependent upon changes to the human, natural, and technological systems that support our human civilization. The SDGs also involve trade-offs that require careful analysis and management using fundamental principles of leave-no-one- behind, equity, circularity, and decoupling. The complex couplings between human, natural, and technological sys- tems have been investigated in the scholarly literature [Nakicenovic et al. (2020); Sachs et al. (2019)]. More specif- ically, these papers have shown that six major transfor- mations in these coupled systems provide an appropriate framework for making progress on the SDGs. While there are different articulations of these transformations, they share many similarities. For our purposes, the six trans- formations are [Sachs et al. (2019)]: (1) Education, gender, and inequality (2) Health and well-being (3) Sustainable energy systems (4) Sustainable food, land, water, and oceans (5) Sustainable cities and communities (6) Digital revolution for sustainable development These transformations are mutually exclusive and col- lectively exhaustive, and are systems-based. As noted in Sachs et al. (2019), these transformations â€œrequire deep, deliberate, long-term structural changes in resource use, infrastructure, institutions, technologies and social rela- tions that must be undertaken in a short period of time.â€� How can such transformative changes be achieved in a short time period? Several strands of research offer key insights on the â€œdynamic interconnected systemsâ€� nature of these transformations [Leach et al. (2018); Dâ€™Amato and Korhonen (2021); Chan et al. (2020)]. In all of them, technological systems play a major role. The authors of Chan et al. (2020) highlight 8 leverage points and 5 levers for actions and interventions to achieve transformative changes. In particular, they note the role of technological innovations as one of the leverage points. We quote from [Chan et al. (2020)]: â€œThis leverage point thus addresses technological and social innovations that are proactive (not only reactive) and that go well beyond the scope of traditional environmental protection policies . . . For example, innovation and investment policy can be designed to transform production systems for a comprehensive suite of improved outcomes, including nature protection and climate mitigation and adaptation . . . â€� The 2030 sustainable development agenda placed a par- ticular emphasis on leaving nobody behind. Indeed, the original UN resolution [UN (2015b)] stated, â€œAs we em- bark on this great collective journey, we pledge that no one will be left behind. Recognizing that the dignity of the human person is fundamental, we wish to see the Goals and targets met for all nations and peoples and for all segments of society. And we will endeavour to reach the furthest behind first.â€� It has since been noted that tech- nological aspects of progress towards SDGs must be such that existing inequalities do not get further magnified. For example, digital technologies have had a very large impact on the development agendas of most nations. While these technologies have had numerous beneficial impacts, they have also exacerbated and reproduced inequalities [Rothe et al. (2023)]. More specifically, a recent study by Omri (2020) examines the role of technological innovation on sustainable development by the stage of development. It comes to the conclusion that technological innovation has no impact on sustainable development in low-income coun- tries. As we consider the IFAC agenda for SDGs, we should pay particular attention to these cautionary lessons. A simplified global socio-ecological model for SDGs was formulated in [Henderson and Loreau (2023)]. This is the sort of model that systems and control community would be comfortable with. Their analysis reveals that the current population size and resource use are not sustainable with the development goals. Their work leads to two options: (1) reduction of consumption levels, or (2) maintaining a balance between people and land by gradual reduction in population. While this model and analysis can be critiqued, it is a good example of systems thinking and analysis that would resonate with the IFAC community. In a seminal paper [Rittel and Webber (1973)] in 1973, Rittel and Weber showed that a significant subset of social planning problems do not admit straightforward techno-economic analysis and solutions. They used the term â€œwicked problemsâ€� to characterize such difficult to solve problems. Wicked problems are characterized by: (1) there is no definitive problem statement, (2) there is no stopping rule, (3) there is no immediate and no ultimate test of a proposed solution, (4) solutions are one-shot operations and are very hard to reverse, (5) it is not easy to describe the set of all possible solutions, and (6) every wicked problem can be seen as a symptom of some other problem. It has been observed that many of the sustainable development problems are â€œwicked problemsâ€� [LoÌˆnngren and SvanstroÌˆm (2016); Kerekes (2023)]. This is a particu- larly challenging issue for engineers and technologists. In this regard, the paper by LoÌˆnngren and SvanstroÌˆm (2016) shows that â€œsystems thinkingâ€� can provide a powerful lever for enabling engineers and technologists to engage with the sustainable development agenda. Systems thinking can be considered an offshoot of control science and leverages dynamical system concepts such as interconnections, feed- back, and delaysâ€“the controls community thus has much to contribute here. The recent paradigm of transdisci- plinary systems engineering pioneered by Madni (2017) is particularly relevant to addressing these sustainable development goals, since they are fundamentally socio- technical-systems problems. 4. THE IFAC AGENDA FOR THE UN SDGS The IFAC is the main global professional organization of the automatic controls community. As such, it is ideally positioned to connect the automatic controls field and people to UN SDGs which are also global. In this section, we will provide an initial approach to analyze and develop this connection. 4.1 SDGs and IFAC CCs and TCs Let us begin by recapping the intellectual agenda of the IFAC community. There are several possible ways to ap- proach this task. One way would be to consider all IFAC journals and conferences. The IFAC is home to eight schol- arly journals and numerous conference proceedings. Here we take the approach of leveraging the IFAC Technical Committees (TCs). The TCs are grouped into 9 clusters: â€¢ CC1: Systems and Signals â€¢ CC2: Design Methods 156 Pramod P. Khargonekar  et al. / IFAC PapersOnLine 58-3 (2024) 153â€“158 â€¢ CC3: Computers, Cognition and Communication â€¢ CC4: Mechatronics, Robotics and Components â€¢ CC5: Cyber-Physical Manufacturing Enterprises â€¢ CC6: Process and Power Systems â€¢ CC7: Transportation and Vehicle Systems â€¢ CC8: Bio- and Ecological Systems â€¢ CC9: Social Systems Each CC has several TCs. It is now possible to map these CCs and TCs to the UN SDGs. We approach this task by leveraging the framework of six societal transformations described by Sachs et al. (2019). A cursory analysis re- veals that Transformation 2 is addressed by the work of TC8.2 and TC8.3; Transformation 3 by the work of TC6.3, TC7.1, TC7.4, and some of the TCs under CC5; Transfor- mation 4 by the work of TC8.1, TC8.3, and TC8.4; Trans- formation 5 by the work of TC9.3 and some of the TCs un- der CC7; and Transformation 6 by the work of TC3.3, and TC5.1-5.3. The work in CC1 and CC2 is more fundamental and offers tools and techniques that are broadly applicable and relevant. Finally, the work of CC9 and associated TC9.1-9.5 is broadly relevant to all six transformations. This is amply illustrated in the recent paper by Stapleton et al. (2023) which reports on the results of an envisioning process for CC9 and its TCs. The IFAC website contains detailed descriptions of the scopes of various TCs as well (https://www.ifac-control.org/areas). This brief analysis points to an opportunity to conduct more comprehensive and deeper exploration of connections and relevance of all the CCs and TCs to the UN SDGs. We also note that the current CC/TC structure was established about 30 years ago [Kahne et al. (2017), pp. 131]. It is our understanding that this structure is under review for potential reorgani- zation. The role of automation and controls in SDGs could be incorporated into this reorganization process. In 2017, led by F. Lamnabhi-Lagarrigue, a group of systems and controls researchers, including the present authors, published a paper [Lamnabhi-Lagarrigue et al. (2017)] on the role of systems and control for the future of humanity. More recently, a large group of control systems researchers, under the leadership of A. Annaswamy, K. Johansson, and G. Pappas, engaged in a large-scale study, over two years, to develop a roadmap for control for societal-scale challenges which resulted in the publication of the report by Annaswamy et al. (2023). Both of these reports have valuable materials for relating automation and control fields to UN SDGs. Specifically, Chapter 2 of [Annaswamy et al. (2023)] addresses Transformations 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The companion paper in this session by Netto et al. (2024) provides a comprehensive analysis of the work in TC9.2 for Transformation 6. As such, we refer the interested reader to that paper for further details. 4.2 Controls for Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation We led the development and writing of Chapter 2.A of [Annaswamy et al. (2023)] on the role of control systems in addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation, which is directly relevant to Transformations 3, 4, and 5, and SDGs 13, 7, 9, and 15. We collaborated with a team of about twenty experts, co-authors of Chapter 2.A, from around the world and covering various application domains and research subdisciplines of control science and engineer- ing. Both areas of opportunity and broader perspectives related to facilitating the impact of control in climate change mitigation and adaptation were covered. Our work is available as Chapter 2.A in [Annaswamy et al. (2023)]. The write-up was subsequently expanded and is to appear soon in the IEEE Control Systems Magazine [Khargonekar et al. (2024)]. We refer to this latter publication as our final paper here. The â€œtargets of opportunityâ€� for automation and controls for climate change mitigation and adaptation were identified as follows: â€¢ Electric Energy Systems â€¢ Electric Power Generation â€¢ Transportation â€¢ Homes, Buildings, and Facilities â€¢ Industry and Manufacturing â€¢ Data, Computing, and Communications â€¢ Hydrogen Ecosystem and Renewable Fuels â€¢ Food and Agriculture â€¢ Water â€¢ Infrastructures and Communities â€¢ Negative Emissions Technologies â€¢ Geoengineering â€¢ Environmental Monitoring â€¢ Socio-Technical Systems We took the â€œroadmapâ€� goal seriously, in that we identified a few (we limited ourselves to three) specific research and development topics in each opportunity target, along with the horizon over which the opportunity could be realized. Three horizons were adopted: â€¢ Short-term: Societal impact by 2030 â€¢ Medium-term: Societal impact during 2030 â€“ 2040 â€¢ Long-term: Societal impact post-2040 We are keenly aware that it is necessary to go beyond technical research and publications. We therefore devoted considerable attention to the larger framework within which research, development, and deployment should be considered. We addressed them as broader perspectives: â€¢ Sustainable economic growth â€¢ From research to large-scale deployment â€¢ Education and awareness â€¢ Equity and social justice â€¢ Transdisciplinary collaborations For further details of the technical opportunities, we refer the reader to (Khargonekar et al. (2024)). 5. LESSONS LEARNED As we reflect on our recently concluded project (see Section 4.2), we offer the following analysis and suggestions, some of which might be useful for others in the control systems community seeking to assess the opportunity space for any of the UN SDGs. Leadership and Team We do not maintain that we were the best people to lead the effort, but as long- term members of the community involved in research, development, and presentations on a variety of topics related to energy, climate, and the environment for a few decades, we had the visibility that was necessary to attract the top experts in relevant areas to the team. We believe the project also benefited from our backgrounds, which  Pramod P.

(2023)] on the role of control systems in addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation, which is directly relevant to Transformations 3, 4, and 5, and SDGs 13, 7, 9, and 15.

LESSONS LEARNED As we reflect on our recently concluded project (see Section 4.2), we offer the following analysis and suggestions, some of which might be useful for others in the control systems community seeking to assess the opportunity space for any of the UN SDGs. Leadership and Team We do not maintain that we were the best people to lead the effort, but as long- term members of the community involved in research, development, and presentations on a variety of topics related to energy, climate, and the environment for a few decades, we had the visibility that was necessary to attract the top experts in relevant areas to the team. We believe the project also benefited from our backgrounds, which included leadership positions in academia, industry, and government â€” several others in our team also covered more than one of these perspectives. A purely academic perspective, in particular, would likely have omitted key considerations such as the state of the industrial and commercial practice, techno-economic and cost factors and trends, and regulatory and policy drivers and implications. Our team came together over the course of many months, and in some cases we added members as we determined that we lacked sufficient expertise in some key opportunity areas â€” and these areas themselves evolved over the course of our discussion. Such openness to revise scope and team will be important for any similar exercise for an opportunity space of societal importance. Organizing Framework As the project work got under- way, there were three stages that were important. First, we needed to ensure that the team had a shared under- standing of the challenges associated with climate change mitigation and adaptation. To this end, we had meetings and presentations summarizing data and analysis from IPCC, IEA, and other sources. Team members at various points contributed additional related information that was new to the rest of usâ€”a case in point, the emissions footprint associated with information and communication technologies, especially given the growth in cryptomining and artificial intelligence. Second, we made the decision early to organize opportu- nities for control technology under industry/application sectorsâ€”as distinct from organizing targets of opportunity under subdisciplines of control (e.g., modeling, optimiza- tion, distributed control, etc.). Although arguments can be made in favor of both alternatives, our approach kept the problem domain in the foreground. In each sector, as noted earlier, we also identified three example opportuni- ties with a time horizon indicated for each. Estimating horizons for impact is a challenge for researchers, who will often underestimate the time and resources needed to scale the technology readiness level ladder to large- scale deployment. But if the research community seeks to make an impact within a time-frame that matters for the climate challenge, it has to become comfortable with the processes and requirements for all that has to happen post- R&D. Any estimates cannot be expected to be accurate, but understanding and appreciation of time-to-scale-and- impact are critical needs. Third, the â€œbroader perspectivesâ€� which comprise the final major section of our report and final paper were not an afterthought but a subject which surfaced early in our dis- cussions and was revisited frequently. These considerations are not ones that are typically prominent in the course of research for control scientists and engineers. However, it is not research for researchâ€™s sake that our focus is on, or that the focus of the control systems community should be on as it seeks to address climate change challenges (or challenges related to any of the UN SDGs). The research-to-societal- impact cycle cannot be left to traditional linear models. We need to expedite the process as much as possible, and extra-research considerations have thus to be integrated early and kept in mind continuously. Target Audiences and Follow-Through We discussed at various points what audiences should be most prominent for us. Our conclusion is that there are three: students and early-career researchers, who have the mindset to be influenced by what we have to say and the runway to make an impact as they get into new areas for research; professional organizations, such as the IFAC and the IEEE CSS, that can launch new initiatives or expand current ones to focus the time and energy of their members and other stakeholders towards challenges and opportunities of societal importance (in this case, climate change); and funding agencies, who can provide the necessary support for the considerable research neededâ€”and the outcomes of our project can suggest funding priorities within the space. Neither climate change nor any of the UN SDGs will be a short-term win for control scientists and engineers. Sustained effort, research along with development, de- ployment, and scaling, will require years and decades of commitment. Broader perspectives of sustainability, eq- uity, justice, awareness, and transdisciplinary collabora- tions will also need to be sustained. Thus, any project like ours cannot end with the dissemination of a report. Doubt- less, updates will be needed as technological developments and societal imperatives evolve. Itâ€™s not clear to us, as we write, whether we are the best ones to take the mission forward beyond the short-term future. At a minimum, we need to get earlier-stage leaders involved. Indeed, a possible criticism of our approach is that we should have engaged more junior, committed researchers earlier and in co-leadership roles. It would behoove readers of this paper who seek to target one or more UN SDGs to keep this lesson learned in mind. 6. RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS It is clear that the IFAC community has much to con- tribute to the UN SDGs. Our work on Chapter 2.A in (Annaswamy et al. (2023)) and in (Khargonekar et al. (2024)) gives us considerable confidence and insight into the importance of the work of the automation and control community to SDGs. The UN SDGs have the greatest importance to developing nations and poorer members of the global society. By and large, the IFAC research community consists of members from developed nations. As such, we need to be particu- larly sensitive to, and inclusive of, developing nations and poorer communities. With this caution, we suggest that the IFAC community and leadership consider the following steps: â€¢ As noted earlier, the companion paper by Netto et al. (2024) shows how the work of TC9.2 maps onto Transformation 6. The work in Khargonekar et al. (2024) addresses Transformation 3 and partially ad- dresses Transformations 4 and 5. We call on the other TCs to systematically consider the Transformations 2-6 from Sachs et al. (2019) and develop detailed descriptions of how their work can enable these trans- formations. As this work is undertaken, TCs and CCs may consider new names and descriptors as part of their reorganization work and connect with sustain- able development imperatives. 158 Pramod P. Khargonekar  et al. / IFAC PapersOnLine 58-3 (2024) 153â€“158 â€¢ The IFAC journals and other publications may en- courage their authors to include appropriate SDGs in the keywords of their papers. This will make it easy for automated information retrieval systems to capture IFAC contributions to SDGs effectively. â€¢ The IFAC conferences should feature SDGs on their websites to inspire authors to frame their contribu- tions so that their relevance to SDGs is clearly artic- ulated. â€¢ The IFAC is fortunate to have a strong industry presence. The IFAC can thus encourage formation of university-industry-government partnerships, with a special focus on developing nations, to further inspire the automation and control community in the pursuit of SDGs. â€¢ The IFAC community should begin to prepare for a successor to SDGs. We expect that discussions to articulate these successor goals will begin as early as 2027. REFERENCES Annaswamy, A.M., Johansson, K.H., Pappas, G.J., et al. (2023).

The United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were formulated to combine imperatives of economic development with environmental sustainability. Formulated and accepted in 2015, the SDGs comprise 17 goals with 169 targets, to be achieved by 2030. For the field of automatic control, the IFAC is the main international organization and therefore represents the appropriate forum to engage with these goals. In this paper, we present a framework that can be used to develop systematic ways of thinking about how the automatic control community in general, and the IFAC in particular, can contribute to the progress towards the achievement of the UN SDGs.
