                  Biosurfactants are biomolecules produced by microorganisms, low in toxicity, biodegradable, and relatively easy to synthesize using renewable waste substrates. Biosurfactants are of great importance with a wide and versatile range of applications, including the bioremediation of contaminated sites. Plants may accumulate soil potentially toxic elements (PTEs), and the accumulation efficacy may be further enhanced by the biosurfactants produced by rhizospheric microorganisms. Occasionally, the growth of bacteria slows down in adverse conditions, such as highly contaminated soils with PTEs. In this context, the plant's phytoextraction capacity could be improved by the addition of metal-tolerant bacteria that produce biosurfactants. Several sources, categories, and bioavailability of PTEs in soil are reported in this article, with the focus on the cost-effective and sustainable soil remediation technologies, where biosurfactants are used as a remediation method. How rhizobacterial biosurfactants can improve PTE recovery capabilities of plants is discussed, and the molecular mechanisms in bacterial genomes that support the production of important biosurfactants are listed. The status and cost of commercial biosurfactant production in the international market are also presented.

				  * Corresponding author      Biosurfactants are biomolecules produced by microorganisms, low in toxicity, biodegradable, and relatively easy to synthesize using renewable waste substrates. Biosurfactants are of great importance with a wide and versatile range of applications, including the bioremediation of contaminated sites. Plants may accumulate soil potentially toxic elements (PTEs), and the accumulation efficacy may be further enhanced by the biosurfactants produced by rhizospheric microorganisms. Occasionally, the growth of bacteria slows down in adverse conditions, such as highly contaminated soils with PTEs. In this context, the plant's phytoextraction capacity could be improved by the addition of metal-tolerant bacteria that produce biosurfactants. Several sources, categories, and bioavailability of PTEs in soil are reported in this article, with the focus on the cost-effective and sustainable soil remediation technologies, where biosurfactants are used as a remediation method. How rhizobacterial biosurfactants can improve PTE recovery capabilities of plants is discussed, and the molecular mechanisms in bacterial genomes that support the production of important biosurfactants are listed. The status and cost of commercial biosurfactant production in the international market are also presented.   Key Words bacterial genome  metal-tolerant bacteria  phytoextraction technology  plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria  rhizospheric microorganism    INTRODUCTION Multi-element-contaminated soils contain a combination of trace and potentially toxic elements (PTEs), including As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Pb (Mu et al. , 2020 ). Soil contamination by multiple PTEs is due to both natural and anthropic causes (Manoj and Kawsar, 2020 ). Natural activities such as volcanic eruptions, erosion, weathering, and continental dust also increase soil PTEs (Zhao et al. , 2019 ). Excessive dispersion of agricultural chemicals, such as pesticides and phosphate fertilizers, often contribute to soil pollution by PTEs (Vareda et al. , 2019 ). Mining, fossil fuel, and industrial sources are more responsible for the multiple PTEs in soil than natural sources (Joshi, 2016 ; Stefanowicz et al. , 2020 ). Soil is a non-renewable agricultural resource and a major PTE sink. Thus, the discharge of PTEs from different industries damages the physicochemical and biological properties of agricultural soil and reduces its usability, leading to food insecurity and causing land tenure problems (March et al. , 2016 ). The removal of PTEs from contaminated soil is therefore of great importance for the protection of the environment and human health (Sarma et al. , 2019b ). Phytoremediation, known as the use of green plants for the removal or disposal of pollutants from the environment, is an environmentally friendly solution for the prevention and control of PTE pollution (Sarma et al. , 2016 ). It is the best alternative compared to the conventional, high cost remediation methods, which often disperse secondary pollution and deteriorate soil fertility, thereby adversely affecting the agro-ecosystem (Prasad and De Oliveira Freitas, 2003 ). The techniques of phytoremediation can be divided into five categories: 1) phytoextraction, 2) phytodegradation, 3) rhizofiltration, 4) phytostabilization, and 5) rhizodegradation (Fig. 1  ). Phytoextraction is used to absorb PTEs from roots and foliage. Valid methods are chosen to recover contaminated areas where plants absorb metals and contaminants, and are effectively removed from the ground by harvesting or the plants (Yu et al. , 2020 ). The roots of the plants are symbiotically associated with rhizobacteria that produce biosurfactants and improve phytoextraction technology (Pankaj et al. , 2020 ). Biosurfactants are surface-active compounds of low molecular weight that are commonly produced by bacteria, yeasts, and other fungi. Characteristically, biosurfactants have the ability to reduce the interfacial tension between two immiscible liquids or between a liquid and a solid (Geetha et al. , 2018 ; Singh and Rathore, 2019 ). They are non-toxic, eco-sustainable, and highly stable. Due to their unique properties of stability and biodegradability, biosurfactants remain active and efficient under a wide range of harsh environmental conditions. Moreover, being bioproducts, biosurfactants are easily degraded, unlike chemical surfactants, which are difficult to degrade. Considering the above qualities, biosurfactants are currently used in a wide range of industrial applications. As documented in the literature, biosurfactants are produced by a variety of microorganisms (Datta et al. , 2020 ). These amphiphilic biomolecules reduce the air/water surface tension, as well as interfacial tension on oil/water interfaces (Banat et al. , 2010 ; Joshi et al. , 2013 ). The types of biosurfactants are defined on the basis of their physical and chemical properties, and include glycolipids, neutral lipids, lipopeptides, phospholipids, fatty acids, and polymers (Sarma et al. , 2019a ). Biosurfactants have highly specific surface activity, are resistant to extreme conditions, and are biodegradable as compared to synthetic surfactants (Yalaoui-Guellal et al. , 2021 ). Rhizobacteria-based biosurfactants can be effectively applied for the removal of both hydrocarbons and heavy metals (Joshi and Desai, 2010 ; Sriram et al. , 2011 ). Restoration of contaminated soils is crucial for a sustainable future and for the ecosystem to remain productive. Many strategies to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs) have been adopted and research is progressing towards the development of viable and sustainable biological methods for soil remediation. Green technology used to remediate soil PTEs is extremely reliable. Biosurfactant-assisted soil remediation technology could be a more efficient choice in the context of cost-effective and eco-sustainable methods (Fig. 2  ). Biosurfactants accelerate the crucial process of desorption of the hydrophobic contaminants closely bound to soil particles. For example, the amendment (400 mg L-1 ) with lipopeptide biosurfactant, produced by the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa  strain LBP9 isolated from soil contaminated with petroleum, increased the aqueous solubility of phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and pyrene by 19, 33, and 45 times, respectively, relative to the unamended control (Bezza and Chirwa, 2017 ). The use of biosurfactants as solvents in soil washing systems for the treatment of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-contaminated soil has the following advantages: 1) it significantly boosts the solubilization of PCBs in the washing solution, resulting in increased efficiency of the removal; and 2) it promotes microbial growth that improves the biodegradation of soil-bound PCBs. This is an important step for the bioremediation process (Zhang et al. , 2016 ). The biosurfactants produced by different microorganisms in the rhizospheres of PTE-accumulating plants are summarized in this review, as well as how they influence rhizobacterial techniques for metal-contaminated soil remediation.  EXPOSURE TO PTEs IS ADVERSE TO LIVING ORGANISMS Exposure to high concentrations of PTEs and trace elements has been proven a serious threat to living organisms, as it poses several health risks (Ali et al. , 2019 ). The global concern is that a rapid rise in economic growth, industrialization, urbanization, and environmental pollution with different pollutants could overwhelm the ability of natural environment to self-clean (Liang and Yang, 2019 ). The effects of pollution on trophic chains have been disruptive in natural ecological cycles and could lead to potential health issues (Sang et al. , 2018 ). Due to their non-biodegradability and persistence in the environment, PTEs may pose a major risk (Du et al. , 2020 ). They can be bioaccumulated within ecosystems and ultimately negatively affect human health through biomagnification in food chains (Esposito et al. , 2018 ). They can be highly toxic to humans, animals, and plants. Cadmium, lead, and mercury are among the most toxic PTEs (Li et al. , 2020 ). Human beings require Fe, Co, Cu, Mn, Mo, and Zn in limited quantities. However, at higher concentrations, all these essential metals are toxic. Excessive levels of PTEs can harm organisms, resulting in impaired physiology and metabolism (Al Osman et al. , 2019 ). The PTEs such as Hg, Pt, and Pb may cause serious illness. Conversely, some elements that are generally toxic are beneficial for certain organisms under certain conditions. However, the impact of vital or beneficial elements on organisms due to continuous accumulation over time is not clearly known. The increase of PTEs in the environment may cause water pollution and agricultural soil pollution (Sarma et al. , 2016 ). In the food chain, PTEs can bioaccumulate and gradually magnify at higher trophic levels, resulting in serious animal health risks (Duri et al. , 2018 ; Saxena et al. , 2020 ). The different types of diseases caused by exposure to PTEs are listed in Table I  . Humans and other living organisms are affected by the exposure to PTEs. Therefore, PTE remediation is vital for the health of all living organisms and the environment.  PTE INFLUX-ACCUMULATION AND DEPOSITION IN SOIL ECOSYSTEM Anthropogenic activities have led to PTE deposition on the soil surface, which has been mainly determined by rock and soil type composition (Fu and Xi, 2020 ). The PTE concentration, distribution, and composition in soil increase with various human activities, such as mining, melting, burning of fossil fuels, disposal of waste, construction, and use of inorganic fertilizers in crops (Xie et al. , 2019 ). Modern agricultural practices, the establishment of new industries, and other anthropogenic activities add a substantial amount of PTEs to the environment. This leads to several toxic effects on all forms of living organisms and also alters soil properties (Uwizeyimana et al. , 2017 ). The concentrations of PTEs, such as Cd, Cu, Cr, Pb, Se, Sb, Zn, Hg, As, and Ni, in the top soil (0–20 cm) and deep soil (150–200 cm) from 31 cities in China were studied by Cheng et al.  (2014) , in relation to the target and intervention values in the National Background Soil Value (NBSV) guideline in China (Chen et al. , 1991 ). Some metal concentrations found are summarized in Fig. 3  . According to the NBSV guideline, the maximum values of Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn in soil are 0.097, 27, 63, and 140 mg kg-1 , respectively. However, metal concentrations in most cities were over the limits set by the NBSV guideline (Cheng et al. , 2014 ).  RHIZOBACTERIA-ASSISTED PHYTOREMEDIATION OF SOIL CONTAMINATED WITH PTEs Phytoremediation is a generally accepted eco-friendly technology and an active field in plant biology research (Ali et al. , 2013 ). Many hyperaccumulating plants have already been recognized as potential candidates for phytoremediation of PTE-contaminated soil (Sarma, 2011 ; Sarma et al. , 2019c ). New opportunities for the use of beneficial rhizosphere and endophytic bacteria to improve plant production, biological control, and PTEs remediation in polluted regions have been demonstrated in recent biotechnological approaches (Ma et al. , 2011 ). Soil and water PTE pollution is a world-wide problem and a major environmental concern. It poses significant risks for human, animal, and ecosystem health. As a result, fast, reliable, and low-cost strategies for remediation of metal-polluted soil and water are required to protect the environment and to safeguard public health (Mishra and Bharagava, 2016 ). Plant-microorganism interactions have been studied to remove PTEs from contaminated soils. Microorganisms can enhance the solubility and plant bioavailability of soil metal elements. Improvement in the plant-microorganisms interactions promotes plant biomass and tolerance to PTEs, and is considered to be a major component of plant remediation technologies (Sarma et al. , 2019b ). Soil PTEs are bound to both organic and inorganic soil components as insoluble precipitates. However, not all metal contaminants are available for plant root absorption. The method of increasing the availability and use of PTE pollutants in soil by plant roots is important for phytoremediation success (Ma et al. , 2011 ). Microbial communities are regarded as influential in the solubility and availability of soil trace metals through the release of biosurfactants, acidification, redox reaction, and chelation (Ullah et al. , 2015 ). Increased availability of PTEs has been reported in plant tissues after rhizobacterial inoculation (Ju et al. , 2020a ). The combination of beneficial rhizobacteria with plants increases plant tolerance to PTEs, which is an essential component of phytoremediation technology (Agarwal et al. , 2020 ). Plant-microorganism interactions lead to higher population densities of microbes and higher metabolism in the rhizosphere under stressful conditions such as soil pollution. Microbial activity aids in plant tolerance and accumulation of PTEs as well as in the stimulation of plant growth (Wang et al. , 2020 ). Plant roots are the principal drivers of phytoremediation, which is facilitated by the communication with a wide variety of specific microorganisms (Gleba et al. , 1999 ). Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) help plants grow in highly contaminated metallic soil by minimizing metal toxicity. The rhizosphere offers a complex and dynamic micro-environment where microorganisms and plant roots create particular communities with substantial waste detoxification potential. Plant root parameters like root morphology and development are affected by the microorganisms (Prasad and De Oliveira Freitas, 2003 ). Increased root exudation of organic solutes can affect phytosiderophore release rate. In addition, rhizospheric microorganisms are symbiotically capable of entering roots to increase the potential for metal uptake (Uroz et al. , 2019 ). Rhizobacteria can increase plant accumulation levels of metals such as Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn. Rhizobacteria have shown a significant role in increasing the abundance of bioavailable metals and thus in improving the metal accumulation potential of hyperaccumulators (Zubair et al. , 2016 ). Co-inoculation of PGPR and Rhizobium  sp. in the plant rhizosphere aids in the removal of metals from contaminated soil by the formation of chelating agents. This method tends to increase the bioavailability of PTEs in soil and facilitates more efficient plant extraction. PGPR and Rhizobium  sp. co-inoculation has enhanced soil nutrition composition and reduced the toxic effects of soil pollution by increasing enzyme activity, microbial activity, and the concentration of ethylenediamine-N ,N '-disuccinic acid (EDDS) (Ju et al. , 2020b ). This can contribute to reduced phytotoxicity and increased soil biological diversity under the environmental pressure of PTEs (Antoniadis et al. , 2019 ). Rhizobium  sp. and PGPR reduce oxidative tissue damage by accelerating enzyme activity, which is an antioxidant system caused by PTE stress (Ju et al. , 2020a ). By improving soil characteristics and biological activity, PGPR can indirectly increase plant growth (Etesami, 2018 ). The PGPR Pseudomonas  sp. DGS6 has been shown to improve plant growth and increase plant uptake of Cu and Zn (Luo et al. , 2015 ). Some rhizobacteria help the host plant by increasing metal storage, siderophores, and metal reduction properties. Examples of host plant and rhizobacteria and their beneficial effects on the phytoremediation of heavy metal-polluted soils are provided in Table II  . Mechanistic functions of rhizobacteria in metal phytoextraction Phytoextraction is a sub process of phytoremediation. In this process, plants remove PTEs and hazardous or metal compounds from soil or water (Napoli et al. , 2019 ). Plants with high metal accumulation capacity are ideal for transporting and concentrating metals from the soil to aboveground biomass, and thus are often used for phytoextraction. Plant rhizobacteria play an important role in rendering PTEs bioavailable to plants. This is due to the existence of colonies of free-living microorganisms that benefit plants by stimulating their growth in PTE-polluted soils (Podile and Kishore, 2006 ). This is accomplished through the reduction of PTE toxicity in plants (Abou-Shanab et al. , 2010 ). The rhizosphere is a complex and diverse microenvironment in which roots form unique communities with substantial detoxification potential for highly toxic waste such as PTEs (Youssef and Chino, 1989 ). In soils where hyperaccumulators are associated with native microorganisms, performance is exceptional even under high concentration of PTEs (Bonfante and Genre, 2010 ). Microorganisms may influence metal solubility and plant uptake by producing iron chelators and siderophores. They also aid in reducing soil pH and/or solubilize metal phosphates to ensure the availability of metals for plants. In addition, plant root parameters such as root morphology and growth influence soil microbial activity. It has been demonstrated that an increased amount of root exudation containing organic solutes may also attract microorganisms. In turn, rhizospheric microorganisms may interact symbiotically with roots to improve the potential of metal absorption. It was previously mentioned that PGPR help accumulate PTEs in the plant system (Gullap et al. , 2014 ). Application of PGPR and atmospheric N fixators to plants as biofertilizers increases the process of plant phytoremediation and the tolerance to PTEs. It is a low-cost, eco-friendly PTE removal technology that is also widely available in nature. PGPR can enhance plant biomass and help plant growth by improving plant N fixation, iron sequestration, phosphate solubilization, hydrogen cyanide production, and antibiotic synthesis (Novo et al. , 2018 ). The ability of genetically modified bacteria to accumulate PTEs when applied to soil has been proven experimentally (Sarma and Prasad, 2018 ). One example is the bacterium Mesorhizobium huakuii  ssp. rengei  strain B3, which accumulates Cd2+  by producing a phytochelatin-metal complex (Sriprang et al. , 2003 ). The engineering of bacterial genomes is a good method for PTE removal. Another bacterium, Methylococcus capsulatus , has been reported to successfully remove Cr using five Cr(VI) reductase genes through successful genetic manipulation (Al Hasin et al. , 2010 ). These genetically modified organisms are likely to be effective inoculants for improving PTE phytoremediation. Several types of rhizobacteria (e.g., Mycobacterium marinum, Pseudomonas putida, Ralstonia eutropha, Escherichia coli, Bacillus idriensis , and Sphingomonas desiccabilis ) were genetically modified for environmental application (Schu et al. , 2009 ; Liu et al. , 2014 ). These bacteria are reported to have an increased PTE remediation capacity. Bacterial cell membranes carry P-type adenosine triphosphatease (ATPase) superfamily transporters, such as P1B-type ATPases, which mediate cytoplasmic substrate (e.g. , Cu, Zn, and Co) efflux and the transport of non-physiological substrates such as Cd, Pb, Au, and Ag. Many bacteria have a cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) factor that exports cytoplasmic metal ions to the periplasm. Periplasm metal efflux and metal thiolate complexes are formed by PB1-type ATPases and CDF transporters. In addition, capsule biogenesis assembly (CBA) transporters (efflux protein complexes) facilitate detoxification of periplasm metal ions and span the inner and outer membranes of bacterial cells (Egler et al. , 2005 ). Transgenic rhizobacterial strains not only remove PTEs but also produce biosurfactants that improve soil regeneration. Some of these modified or genetically engineered bacteria are able to improve soil fertility by fixing atmospheric N during symbiosis with legumes. Bacterial cells have special transport systems for PTEs. Extracellular metal ions interact with a specific transmembrane protein receptor that forms a complex between metal ions and metal receptors (Ananthanarayanan and Kerman, 2006 ). Subsequently, the metal ion flows into the cytoplasm, where it binds to an intracellular metal binding protein (metallothionein/metallochaperone), leading to the chemical alteration and compartmentalization of metal ions (Sarma and Prasad, 2016 ).  Evidence of plant-rhizobacteria effective extraction of PTEs The Chinese National Soil Contamination Survey Report 2014 states that 19.4% of Chinese farmland has been polluted with 82.4% PTEs, which are therefore considered the principal pollutants of soil. Most developing nations have reported soil contamination with multiple PTEs, similar to China (Zhao et al. , 2015 ). All stakeholders should therefore demand the safe removal of such PTEs from the soil. The most common soil PTEs are Cd, Co, Cr, Pb, and Zn, which require major attention due to human toxicity and bioavailability. Zn and other metals are essential plant elements at normal concentration, but become toxic at high concentrations (Arif et al. , 2016 ). These elements are found in high concentrations in the agricultural fields in the vicinity of mining areas or smelters. Agricultural fields contaminated with metals and PTEs are posing an environmental threat (Wuana and Okieimen, 2011 ). Phytoextraction is therefore considered a low-cost, in-situ  technology to remove contaminants from soil. In order to successfully phytoextract metals by plants with high biomass and transfer metals from soil to upper parts of the plant, the following are required: i) metals near plant roots need to be bioavailable and ii) soil quality and health need to be maintained. Over the last two decades, many plants such as Noccaea caerulescens  (Mohtadi et al. , 2012 ) and Sedum plumbizincicola  have been examined for their ability to remove PTEs from soil (Ma et al. , 2015 ). Moreover, a database containing 775 plants (PHYTOREM) with the capability of accumulating 19 key metal elements has been created by Environment Canada (McIntyre, 2003 ). Unfortunately, many hyperaccumulators are ineffective for large-scale phytoremediation due to slow development and slow biomass production. Table III   presents some rhizobacteria that have been developed and genetically modified to help remove PTEs from contaminated soil. In the remediation of metals and metalloids, microbial biotechnology has played an essential role. Metabolic engineering of rhizobacteria is necessary in environmental application to increase plant growth production, which in turn promotes the accumulation of pollutants by creating an ideal rhizosphere environment for speeding up the recovery process and improving the efficacy of phytoremediation by the development of metal-resistant strains (Anesiadis et al. , 2008 ). The use of chemicals typically in the form of chelators, fertilizers, or growth promoters has been suggested to increase the extraction efficiency of high biomass plants (Saxena et al. , 2020 ). Researchers observed that the use of elemental sulfur increased the foliar concentrations of Zn and Cd in willow plants (Hoefer et al. , 2015 ). However, no significant impact on biomass production has been observed. Chen et al.  (2016)  found that the accumulation of Pb in Scripus triqueter  improved with the addition of nitrilotriacetic acid and alkyl polyglucosides. The use of N fertilizers has also been proposed to improve the process of Pb extraction. Nitrogen fertilization in plants increases biomass, which in turn aides in a higher accumulation of PTEs. Thus, stimulating rhizobacterial association with plants increases the accumulation of PTEs by plants.  Biosurfactant-producing rhizobacteria Several bacterial isolates within the genera Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Arthrobacter, Micrococcus , and Rahnella  are reported as effective producers of biosurfactants (Saikia et al. , 2012 ). However, the production of biosurfactant by Rahnella  sp. is not well understood. The endophytic Rahnella  sp. JN6 improved phytoremediation efficiency significantly for Cd-, Pb-, and Zn-polluted soil (He et al. , 2013 ). A new strain of PTE-resistant Rahnella  sp. isolated from Cr-contaminated subsurface soil has been shown to produce large quantities of biosurfactants and remove PTEs. Rhizobacteria not only produce biosurfactants that contribute to the bioavailability of metals, but also increase plant growth. The ability of rhizobacteria to produce biosurfactants was estimated by measuring the surface tensions of a cell-free culture. The drop collapse test and emulsion index were then used to measure the biosurfactant quality (Turkovskaya et al. , 2001 ). Table IV   shows some biosurfactants produced by bacterial isolates from various rhizospheres and contaminated soil environments. Soil pollution is a global environmental problem. The content of PTEs in soil has increased due to anthropogenic contamination. In Qingyuan of China, for example, the soil is contaminated with electronic waste, demonstrating a significant amount of PTEs. However, despite high concentration of PTEs, a risk assessment for defining a soil as contaminated one must be established at each specific site (Fiorentino et al. , 2017 ; Fagnano et al. , 2020 ). Once the concentration of PTEs in the soil is higher than a nation's determined legislative value, the site must be considered eligible for remediation measures (Agrelli et al. , 2020 ). Given that soil PTE pollution is a major problem, numerous in situ  and ex situ  techniques are used to remove PTEs from the soil. The removal of co-occurring toxic pollutants is more complex and difficult than that of a single contaminant (Ye et al. , 2017 ). For this reason, different remediation technologies, such as physicochemical remediation and biological remediation, using microbial biochar or phytoremediation technologies should be used to reduce multiple contaminants simultaneously. Plant-based technologies like phytoremediation and phytoextraction are particularly promising for relatively low concentration of PTEs in soils. Biosurfactants are cost-effective and environmentally sound for the treatment of soils contaminated by multiple PTEs (Table V  ). Glycolipid biosurfactants, such as sophorolipids, are produced in large quantities. For this reason, their market price is around $2–$5 kg-1 . Conversely, artificial surfactants such as iturin and surfactin are produced in small quantities and cost $10 000–$15 000 kg-1  (Dhanarajan and Sen, 2014 ). Companies like BASF-Cognis (Germany and USA) and Ecover (Belgium) started producing biosurfactants fairly recently. Some companies that produce biosurfactants for environmental purposes are Ecochem Ltd. (Canada), Saraya (Japan), Sigma-Aldrich Co. (USA), and Intobio (South Korea). Jeneil Biosurfactants (USA) has also been identified as a leading producer of biosurfactants. AGAE Technologies LLC (USA) and Fraunhofer IGB (Germany) are known to manufacture commercially available rhamnolipids (Ashby et al. , 2013 ). Cost-effective production (Table V ) is still a major constraint on their successful marketing, despite increasing consumer demand for environmentally-friendly biosurfactants (Dhanarajan and Sen, 2014 ). In comparison to synthetic agents, biosurfactants used for soil restoration are generally produced by microorganisms. They are highly biodegradable, have low toxicity, and are highly effective in pollutant elimination (Liu et al. , 2018 ). The most commonly used microbial biosurfactants are rhamnolipids (RAMs). RAMs reduce the surface and interfacial tension of water effectively, thereby indirectly facilitating the removal of pollutants from the soil. The anionic character of RAMs allows for the formation and removal of ionic bonds with cationic PTEs. Due to their stabilizing properties, RAM-metal complexes are more powerful than soil-metal interactions. The mechanism of PTE sorption by biosurfactants is promoted in solid phases in two main ways. First, biosurfactants mediate the complexation of the free form of metal in the solution. Biosurfactants reduce the activity of the metal solvent and promote desorption in accordance with the Le Chatelier principle. The second way is to accumulate metal at the solid-solution interface using a low interfacial tension. This allows direct contact between the biological agent and the metals absorbed. The mechanisms of PTE removal for microbial biosurfactants include ion exchange, precipitation for dissolution, and counter-binding. Anionic biosurfactants act by mechanism of ion exchange. In this process, the negative charge binds the cationic metal ion, which is positively charged, thus facilitating removal. Metals can also be bound to water-soluble microbial polar head groups (Fig. 4  ). Bacillus  species are able to synthesize surfactin, a potent biosurfactant of which the large multi-enzyme peptic synthetase complex is non-ribosomally catalyzed by its biosynthesis. Surfactin synthetase consists of three protein subunits: SrfA, ComA, and SrfC (Fig. 4 ). The function of the protein moiety with the peptide synthetase enzyme surfactin is encoded by four open reading frames (ORFs). The operon containing the above-mentioned genes also contains a comS  gene lying inside and outside the frame of the srfB. Deletion mutant studies have shown that srfAD is not essential for surfactin biosynthesis, while the other three ORFs are essential for this process. Sfp is another gene-encoding phosphopantetheinyl transferase that is required for the activation of surfactin synthetase via  post-translational modification. It is absolutely essential for the production of surfactin. Few mutants have been found to have all the genes required for surfactin biosynthesis, with the exception of Sfp . Acyltransferase is another enzyme that is responsible for the transfer of the hydroxy fatty acid moiety to SrfA. However, it is not yet characterized (Peypoux et al. , 1999 ). Bacillus subtilis  can regulate the production of surfactin by a cell-density responsive mechanism using the peptide pheromone ComX (Steller et al. , 2004 ). When the cell density of the bacteria increases, ComX, a peptide signal, accumulates in the growth medium. The gene product ComQ activates ComX and assembles it to form a peptide signal. The gene expression of SrfA  is controlled by ComX quorum sensing, which activates the signal transduction system when interacting with ComP and ComA. The histidine protein kinase ComP phosphorylates the response regulator ComA, which is activated and stimulates the transcription of the Srf  operon. The ComA-phosphate phosphatase RapC is inhibited by the CSF pheromone, which results in Srf  transcription activation. The introduction of CSF, an extracellular peptide, into the cell is performed by the SpoOK oligopeptide permease. ComR and SinR also influence SrfA  expression. ComR post-transcriptionally enhances SrfA  expression while SinR negatively controls SrfA  by regulating ComR (Chakraborty and Das, 2014 ).   ROLES OF PGPR AND BIOSURFACTANTS IN PHYTOSTABILIZATION Phytostabilization means a decrease of PTE mobility in soil. PTE immobilization may be accomplished by decreasing dust blown by the wind, decreasing soil erosion, and decreasing the solubility or bioavailability of PTEs (Visconti et al. , 2020 ). By adding soil amendments such as biosurfactants, soil solubility can be decreased and groundwater leaching be minimized. PTE mobility decreases the accumulation of pollutants through plant root absorption or due to precipitation inside the root area. Phytostabilization is a particularly potential option if other remediation approaches are not feasible in large areas polluted by PTEs. Plants should be capable of tolerating high levels of PTEs, of generating high levels of root biomass with immobilizing contaminants, and of sustaining root contaminants (Ma et al. , 2011 ). In this case, PGPR can help by producing organic acids as well as biosurfactants. Field work has shown that phytostabilization can effectively stabilize PTEs such as Pb and radionuclides. Studies also indicated that phytostabilization can reduce metal leaching by converting metals to an insoluble oxidation state (Grandlic et al. , 2008 ). Plants reduce toxic Cr(VI) to less toxic Cr(III). Plants can use on-site rhizospheric processes to bioconcentrate (phytoextract) or inactivate (phytostabilize) PTEs. Mobility and bioavailability of PTEs in the soil are key factors affecting plant extraction and phytostabilization, especially in the rhizosphere where root uptake or elimination occurs. The development of new methods for improving (phytoextraction) or reducing (phytostabilization) the bioavailability of metal contaminants in the rhizosphere, as well as improving plant development, growth, and health, could significantly accelerate the process of bioremediation. To assess the phytostabilization potential of Cd-contaminated soil, the effect of bacterial inoculum on plant growth and metal accumulation in plant organs was evaluated. The bacterial inoculation, due to their ability to bioaccumulate, relieved the metal load and phytotoxicity of Cd, suggesting a promising technique for plant-bacterial stabilization.  METAL-RESISTANT RHIZOBACTERIA MODIFIED SOLUBLE-EXCHANGEABLE SOIL METAL FRACTION The interaction of various components in soil ecosystem such as microbial biomass and soil chemicals, including PTEs and radionuclides, can significantly affect the efficiency of the bioremediation method. Furthermore, root exudate, scaly cells, microbial activity, and the diversity and content of metals may affect the bioavailability of PTEs in the soil and plants (Boechat et al. , 2017 ). Microorganisms living in soil contaminated by high concentrations of PTE help solubilize metals and increase metal extraction. These microorganisms promote the growth of plants, which in turn encourage production of metal-sequestering phytohormones and siderophores, biological fixing of atmospheric N, phosphate solubilization, and the production of biosurfactants. These microorganisms change the state of metals by oxidizing in order to immobilize PTEs through bioreduction or biosorption and thus reduce the available forms of biometals (Boechat et al. , 2017 ). Phosphorus is the second largest nutrient-limiting growth substance in organically and inorganically abundant soils (Kumar, 2016 ). Given the P content present in the soil (400–1 200 mg kg-1 ), only a small amount is soluble (Rodrguez and Fraga, 1999 ) at approximately 1 mg kg-1 . Soil P deficiency is attributed to the formation of insoluble complexes with cations such as Al and Fe under alkaline conditions (Balemi and Negisho, 2012 ). This leads to precipitation or fixation of P that therefore becomes unavailable to plants. The P in chemical fertilizers can also be unavailable and ultimately lead to soil degradation. Therefore, certain types of bacteria and fungi have been identified to improve soil quality as they have a considerable impact on the solubilization of insoluble phosphate forms present in soil. This increases the amount of available P and promotes the growth of plants. Microorganisms that solubilize phosphates belong to the class of benign microbes, which help resolve unavailable forms of P and make them available for use by plants, and to the genera of Bacillus, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Rhizobium, Flavobacterium, Penicilium , and Aspergillus  (Li et al. , 2016 ), which can be used as efficient biofertilizers (Kalayu, 2019 ).  CONCLUSIONS In agriculture, the use of large quantities of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and fungicides, as well as various types of detergents, adversely affects soil quality and is ultimately toxic to soil health. Soil pollution increases with PTEs such as Zn, Cd, Cr, Pb, Hg, and Co. At very high concentrations, these PTEs have caused many serious human diseases. Diseases of kidney and lung, dermatitis, poisoning, and anemia are rapidly increasing. The use of rhizobacteria may solve soil contamination with PTEs, which is cost-effective and achieved via  the biosurfactants produced by rhizobacteria such as Pseudomonas  sp. and Rahmena  sp., through transforming metals into bioavailable forms and promoting plant growth. The production of various biosurfactants, phytohormones, and siderophores enhances the plant's ability for the accumulation of PTEs and makes plant extraction a more attainable possibility. Consequently, the use of rhizobacteria-produced biosurfactants in phytoextraction technology promotes PTE-contaminated soil remediation. Biosurfactant-assisted phytoextraction technology is also considered to be environmentally-friendly, cost-effective, and less harmful in the removal of PTEs and thus a possible method for a sustainable future.
