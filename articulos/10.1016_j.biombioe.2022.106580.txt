                  Pine needles are a major cause of forest fires in the western region of the Himalayas in India. There is a need to explore avenues for utilizing this forest bio residue. Pine needles in the form of briquettes are an important source of renewable energy as it has low carbon emissions, low-cost technological interventions, easy accessibility and direct community benefits. The purpose of this paper is to list, classify and rank the enablers supporting energy generation using briquettes made from dried pine needles. This study ranks the enablers by using the fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process which is a multi-criteria decision-making approach. This paper finds that technological enablers are key to such interventions using dried and fallen pine needles for energy generation. The second category is environment-related enablers that directly impact the environment, followed by the market-related factors including good demand for the bio briquettes by the industry, viable fuel linkage, and a sense of business approach among the main actors. Economic enablers are next in importance, including factors such as employment generation, additional income, and self-sufficiency making such initiatives attractive enough to be adopted by people. Government and lastly, social and community-related enablers are next in priority for such projects. This is the first research that recognized, classified as well as ranked these enablers to pine needle-based energy generation in Uttarakhand in achieving United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 such as climate action and affordable and clean energy.

Pine needles are a major cause of forest fires in the western region of the Himalayas in India. There is a need to explore avenues for utilizing this forest bio residue. Pine needles in the form of briquettes are an important source of renewable energy as it has low carbon emissions, low-cost technological interventions, easy accessibility and direct community benefits. The purpose of this paper is to list, classify and rank the enablers supporting energy generation using briquettes made from dried pine needles. This study ranks the enablers by using the fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process which is a multi-criteria decision-making approach. This paper finds that technological enablers are key to such interventions using dried and fallen pine needles for energy generation. The second category is environment-related enablers that directly impact the environment, followed by the market-related factors including good demand for the bio briquettes by the industry, viable fuel linkage, and a sense of business approach among the main actors. Economic enablers are next in importance, including factors such as employment generation, additional income, and self-sufficiency making such initiatives attractive enough to be adopted by people. Government and lastly, social and community-related enablers are next in priority for such projects. This is the first research that recognized, classified as well as ranked these enablers to pine needle-based energy generation in Uttarakhand in achieving United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 such as climate action and affordable and clean energy.

It has direct community benefits and a long list of comparative advantages over several other modes of energy generation. Pine needle is a form of forest-bio-residue of the Chir pine tree (Pinus roxburghii Sarg). It grows in the states of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, West Bengal in India and other neighbouring Himalayan nations. As per the Forest Survey of India (2019) report, Uttarakhand has the highest percentage of chir pine forest cover [1 ]. In the eastern Himalayan range, chir pine rarely grows beyond 1000 m above sea level, while in the western Himalayas, it grows between 450 and 1800 m above sea level [2 ,3 ]. Pine needles are a form of forest-bio-residue having all the characteristics of being seen as an important source of renewable energy [4 ], especially in the western region of the Himalayas in India (refer to Fig. 1  , Fig. 2  ). It must be addressed as a resource because it is highly inflammable and a destructive source of engulfing fires and carbon emissions apart from the huge damage it causes every year [5 ] (refer to Fig. 3  ). As per Uttarakhand Forest Department data [6 ], pine trees range across half a million hectares of the forest area in the state. In 2019, forest fires due to pine residue affected 1244.64 ha of forest. It adds nearly 500 million kilograms of CO2 every year into Uttarakhand's atmosphere [7 ]. There is an urgent need to explore avenues for using this forest bio residue to support affordable and clean energy, and climate action as indicated in the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. It is not just the comparative cost-benefit perspective, which should be the economic reason for pine needle being used as a resource, it includes long-term benefits, which will be complementary to several efforts made concerning climate change mitigation, alternative and renewable energy [10 ], reverse migration [11 ], and structured agriculture related to medicinal and aromatic plants [12 ,13 ]. The paper is based on a practical sponsored experimental research project wherein the research team developed the technology to convert pine needles into briquettes and longitudinally has been studying the related aspects [14 ]. This empirical work aims to review the evidence of enablers supporting energy generation using dries and fallen pine needles, their classification, and prioritization in the state of Uttarakhand in India. Specifically, the following issues in the form of these research questions are addressed: RQ1.What are the potential enablers to pine briquette-based energy generation in India? RQ2. How these enablers be prioritized and categorized from a strategy perspective? RQ3. How shall the government accord priority support to energy generation using pine needles to check forest fires in India? To identify all the enablers to energy generation using briquettes made from dried pine leaves, an exhaustive and extensive review of the literature was done. Five focused group discussions (FGDs) were organized with people, including professors from reputed universities, forest officers and the villagers from the northwestern Himalayas where pine trees exist. This helped the researcher in finalizing the list of enablers. The fuzzy AHP technique was used to assign weights to these enablers for ranking them based on their importance. Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method makes a pairwise comparison of these enablers and defines their comparative position for ranking them and their sub-factors by using qualitative and quantitative methods. The fuzzy AHP technique permits uncertainty and fuzziness in the decision-making process, making it suitable for many real-life applications. This is the first research that recognized, classified as well as ranked these enablers to pine needle-based energy generation in Uttarakhand to support climate action, and affordable and clean energy as indicated in the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. Additionally, it is among the first to use fuzzy AHP to rank enablers and apply sensitivity analysis for robustness checks. Pine needle-based renewable energy generation proposes an opportunity to achieve many other sustainable development goals such as no poverty, gender equality, and reduced inequalities. The organization of the paper is as follows: Second section includes a review of the literature on the factors supporting energy generation using briquettes made from pine needles. Section 3  discusses the research methodology involved and a brief explanation of the AHP method with fuzzy logic. Section 4  highlights the discussion and key results. In section 5 , sensitivity analysis was incorporated to check the technique's robustness, followed by sections 6 and 7, where conclusions, implications and limitations are summarized.  2 Material and methods 2.1 Identification of enablers for pine leaves-based energy generation in Uttarakhand, India An exhaustive literature review was done using different sources such as government reports, and research journals to identify enabling factors for energy generation using briquettes made from dried and fallen Pine leaves. Five FGDs were conducted with participants including senior professors from reputed Universities, forest officers and villagers belonging to the pine forests. Based on their inputs, forty factors were finalized. They were categorized into six categories: technology, environment, economic, government and institutions, and social and market-related enablers. The list of enabler categories and their subcategories are mentioned in Table 1  , and their detailed description is given in the following section: 2.1.1 Technology-related enabler (TG) Briquettes made from dried pine needle is one of the sources of energy generation (Fig. 4  ). The bio-residue briquetting process is technically easy and very reasonable. It includes non-monotonous, least specialized and simple activities that could be easily performed even by women [4 ]. It is a manually operated, portable bio-briquetting machine that runs on Pascal's fundamentals and can produce pressure up to 10 Ton. The machine is purely indigenous and requires basic equipment for its fabrication. The machine can produce one briquette of 25 g at a time and can produce up to 3 Kg per hour. This process has a low maintenance cost because there are no electrical gear and other electrical components. Manually operated bio briquetting machine has benefits such as less maintenance, easy transportation, low operating time, low cost and multiple uses. Such machines are multipurpose as they could work on the fastener technique and might utilize any type of bio buildup to make briquettes [4 ,15 ,16 ]. Low-cost technology has a scope of improvisation and household-level customization to develop new forms of existing products and produce new products as well [17 ]. Awareness among local people regarding the environmental friendliness of the technology and machinery used for pine-based energy generation is another enabling factor.  2.1.2  Environment-related enabler (EV) Most of the people in rural areas still depend on fuel wood/coal to satiate their daily energy needs. Fuel - wood not only puts a burden on the forest but is a source of emission of various harmful gases and smoke in the atmosphere. Forest bio-residue-based fuel in the form of pine briquettes has a calorific value comparable to that of wood and lower-grade coal and is a comparatively cleaner fuel than the other two in terms of emission. The abundance of pine needles and the adoption of low-cost technology ensures the affordability of the fuel in the region. The produced pine briquettes is utilized primarily for meeting their household requirement (i.e., cooking and heating). The pine briquettes are more efficient when compared to traditionally used firewood and coal as fuel. Biomass is inherently carbon neutral and therefore a source of renewable energy. Published studies presume carbon neutrality of biofuels in either of two approaches: implicit sequestration credit or explicit sequestration credit. Most studies apply the former approach, simply ignoring the CO2 flux within a biofuel [52 ], presuming that ‘CO2 in equals CO2 out’, so using a net flux of zero. Others, such as [53 ], use the latter approach, offsetting biomass-combustion CO2 emissions with a sequestration credit that is nearly equal to the combustion emission. Either way, the biomass combustion footprint is zero or close to it, i.e. carbon neutral. One of the environment-related enablers is the impetus toward energy security and climate change. Energy security refers to being made sure about the flexibility of energy with no interruption, and environmental change moderation is one of the significant main thrusts behind the developing interest in renewable energy. The results of quickly rising worldwide temperatures will be broad and destroying for people and the earth except if the dire move is made universally to control emanations [5 ,18 ]. Another driving force for this initiative is to provide safety to nearby broadleaf forests, and other vegetation from forest fires and provide them scope to rejuvenate. Dried pine needles are highly flammable and add nearly 500 million kilograms of CO2  every year into the atmosphere of Uttarakhand [7 ]. This initiative may reduce the discharge of Greenhouse gases and benefit people residing in the surrounding areas in terms of their health because of the reduction of harmful gas from the other traditionally available source of energy like coal and wood [15 ,16 ]. Addressing environmental issues like soil degradation, and wildlife extinction due to forest fires, especially crown fire, which is most dangerous for biodiversity, is another enabler for utilizing pine needles for energy generation [19 ]. Pine briquettes are greener and environment-friendly energy substitutes for wood and coal. It is a thermal concept as it can be used for both household and commercial purposes for cooking using stoves.  2.1.3 Economic enabler (EN) Economic enablers are another driving force behind pine briquettes-based energy generation. Villages situated in the northwestern Himalayas have lesser avenues of employment and revenue generation. This initiative may provide a financial advantage to the residents of these villages close to chir pine forest. Gathering the biomass from the forests and afterwards changing over the equivalent into briquettes helps generate additional income and make people self-sufficient; however, it will also contribute to controlling forest fires in these regions (Fig. 5  ) [15 ,16 ]. Pine needles are available in abundance in the forests of northwestern Himalayas to ensure the sustainable supply of pine briquette manufacturing. It is estimated that around two million tons of dried fallen leaves are shed in the state every year [6 ,20 ]. Such a huge quantity of biomass (pine needles) can be utilized as an alternate fuel source in the region. Dried and fallen pine leaf blocks growth of fresh green grass that could be used for grazing animals is another enabler to pine briquettes based energy generation. Easy availability of other types of bio residue like farm residue (rice husk) and sawdust [5 ,21 ] ensures continuity of production as pine trees shed leaves only from January to April [6 ]. Low moisture content and low ash density make these alternate bio residues more cost-effective compared to other fuels. It is more convenient to transport, handle and store [21 ,22 ]. There is good scope for United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCCC) funding and also earning carbon credits is another enabling factor as pine briquettes decrease carbon emissions and, if blended with some other material, save the environment from lethal Sulfur pollutants [21 ]. Biomass is inherently carbon neutral [50 ]. The smoke index of pine-based briquettes is 1 after 2 min of burning which means there is barely any smoke after 2 min of burning as compared to traditional fuel that produces the highest smoke for the first 2 min [51 ]. In this study, pine needle briquette was prepared and physio-chemical parameters were tested. Beehive briquettes provide poor communities with a clean‐burning, carbon-neutral, low-cost cooking source.  2.1.4 Government and institution-related enabler (GT) Government and institutional support are other important enabling factor for such initiatives. In 2016, one government order related to the free transport of dry and fallen pine needles was passed [23 ]. Government departments have very proactive and trained field staff who are well equipped with detection, communication and suppression of forest fires. There is strong coordination between different government agencies and a strong interface between government and community. Uttarakhand's pine policy has also been introduced in the year 2018, which clearly states regulations related to the usage of pine biomass [24 ]. There are several other acts and policies such as Forest Conservation Act (1980), Indian Forest Act (1927), National Forest Policy (1988) and, The Forest (Conservation) Rules (1981) [25 ,26 ]. This activity has also been awarded the status of the cottage industry. Leading research and educational institutes of national status such as the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee and the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies have been supporting such initiatives by undertaking research projects to develop machinery that is efficient and handy for individual use for manufacturing briquettes from pine needles [14 ].  2.1.5 Social and community-related enabler (SC) Environmental change moderation and the financial health of the people are two main factors behind community cohesion & trust among villagers [15 ,16 ]. Women in these hilly regions consider such initiatives as a secondary source of income for them that could contribute to household income. Community participation in the utilization of the resources like forest bio residue is significant in the region. Enthusiastic entrepreneurs, especially unemployed, but educated youth and villagers, feel pride in addressing an issue like climate change. This initiative is economically viable, socially acceptable, and environmentally friendly [16 ]. There is a change in peoples' mindset towards such a project. Different government organizations in the state attempted to initiate pine needle briquetting [15 ,16 ,19 ]. Community participation in forest bio residue resource utilization-forest user and forest bio residue asset the executives while accomplishing a much crucial objective of environmental change moderation with economic empowerment of nearby networks through essential mechanical mediations. Network cooperation in nature preservation is reliably diminishing essential given expanding guidelines. Different business parts of the forest should be returned in light of a legitimate concern for economic increases of the close-by networks [16 ].  2.1.6 Market-related enabler (MK) One of the market-related enablers is the good demand for value-added products in the marketplace for fuel and smoking. This includes bio-briquettes, Lantana camara briquettes, cottonweed briquettes, Artemisia indica briquettes etc. The smoke produced from these briquettes possesses various medicinal properties ranging from antibacterial, anticancer, anti-fungal and many more. Viable fuel linkage is another, enabling factor as briquettes made from dried pine needles are an alternative energy source for commercial and household purposes. It has a high calorific value that gives it a preferable fuel option over the other alternatives available [18 ]. Local procurement by commercial entities such as restaurants, hotels and sugar mills makes it an attractive fuel option as other alternative fuels such as LPG are either very expensive or non-available. Another enabling factor is the sense of business approach among the main actors and value chain partners is very high. These people feel motivated to be a part of such an initiative, as it protects their environment and is a source of employment and income for them. The sites where these pine needles are collected and converted into briquettes are easily approachable because they are motorable, making it convenient to transport them to the point of final consumption or close to the utilization place [4 ]. The terms "ontology" and "epistemology" refer to the nature of reality, "how do we know the world," and "methodology" allude to how we acquire knowledge in the framework of the "chosen" nature of reality, respectively [54 ]. AHP is an MCDM method that aids in establishing the comparative position and performs pairwise comparisons to rank factors and subfactors utilizing both quantitative and qualitative elements [55 ]. The fuzzy AHP approach allows for fuzziness and uncertainty in the decision-making process, making it suitable for such real-world applications.   2.2 Research methodology In this study, AHP and fuzzy logic has been used to assess and rank these enablers to pine needle-based energy generation in the Uttarakhand state of India, as shown in Fig. 6  . With the aid of one-on-one interviews and concentrated group discussions, factors that affect the production of energy from pine leaves have been compiled from existing literature and comments from experts. They provided suggestions, and a questionnaire was eventually created. For the objective of gathering information for these surveys, in-depth interviews with 65 specialists from the forest department and academicians were undertaken. Finalizing the list of responders required the use of judgmental sampling. AHP employs a small sample size since large samples produce inconsistent results. The weights of each barrier were calculated using AHP and fuzzy logic, and then these enablers were prioritized and ranked. The reliability and validity of this study were improved by the use of triangulation and peer briefing [54 ]. 2.2.1 Fuzzy AHP methodology To rank these enablers based on their importance, this study has used AHP with fuzzy logic. AHP has popularly been used across various researches associated with the prioritization of enablers and barriers, cost-benefit analysis, allocation of resources [27–39 ,41–43] . Vagueness and subjectivity in the data are controlled by using fuzzy logic [38 ,40 ]. To cope with uncertain numerical quantities in a useful manner, Zadeh invented fuzzy numbers [49 ]. A fuzzy number is a generalization of a regular, real number in that it refers to a connected collection of potential values, each of which weights 0 and 1, rather than to a single, discrete value [1 ]. (a, b, c) represents triangular fuzzy number N, and μm  (z) as the membership function. The study is based on convex fuzzy analysis using AHP.(1) μ m  ( z )  = { z − a  b − a     c − z  c − b     0     a ≤ z ≤ b    b ≤ z ≤ c    O t h e r w i s e         with -∞ < a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ ∞. The strongest grade of membership is the parameter b that is, fN (b) = 1, while a and c are the lower and upper bounds. Triangular fuzzy numbers are N1  (n 1 −  , n 1  , n 1 +    ) and N2 ( n 2 −  , n 2  , n 2 +  )   . Steps in the Fuzzy AHP process as per Chang's analysis are as follows [44 ,45 ].Step 1 Calculate the Fuzzy synthetic extent value for ith object:  (2) Gi = ∑  j 1 = i 1  m 1   N g i 1  j 1   ⊗  ( ∑  i 1 = 1  n 1   ∑  j 1 = 1  m 1   N g i 1  j 1    )  − 1   ,  i 1 = 1,2 ,  … … … n     Where,(3) ∑  j 1 = i  m 1   N g i 1  j 1   = ( ∑  j 1 = i 1  m 1   N i 1 j 1  −  ,  ∑  j 1 = i 1  m 1   N i 1 j 1   ,  ∑  j 1 = i 1  m 1   N i 1 j 1  +   )   i 1 = 1,2 ,  … … … n     (4) ( ∑  i 1 = 1  n 1   ∑  j 1 = 1  m 1   N g i 1  j 1    )  − 1   =  [ 1 ∑  i 1 = 1  n 1   ∑  j 1 = 1  m 1   N i 1 j 1  +    ,  1 ∑  i 1 = 1  n 1   ∑  j 1 = 1  m 1   N i 1 j 1     ,  1 ∑  i 1 = 1  n 1   ∑  j 1 = 1  m 1   N i 1 j 1  −     ]      Step 2 For each fuzzy synthetic extent value, calculate the degree of possibility. If N2 = ( n 2 −  , n 2  , n 2 +    ) ≥ N1= (n 1 −  , n 1  , n 1 +    ) then (N 2 ≥ N 1 = [ min ( μ N 1     y ≥ x  s u p      (x), μN2 (y)] x and y are membership values.  Step 3 Define the minimum degree of possibility of the superiority of each enabler with the other. Calculate the weight vector of each enabler category. A convex fuzzy number is denoted as follows,(5) V (G ≥ G1 , G2  … GK ) = minV (G ≥ Gi ), i = 1, 2, … … k   (6) d ( G i  )  = min V ( G ≥ G k  )  = W i ′   k = 1,2 ,  n  a n d  k ≠ I      Weights, W 1 i ,     of the factors are(7) W 1  = ( W 1 1 ′  ,  W 1 2 ′  ,  … … ,  W 1 n ′  )  ⋅ T       Step 4 After normalization, W1′ shows priority weights.  (8) W 1 ′  = ( W 1 1  ,  W 1 2  ,  … … ,  W 1 n  )  ⋅ T .      Studies by authors such as Buckley and Ross [46 ,47 ] provide a detailed explanation of the concepts of fuzzy numbers, fuzzy sets, and fuzzy operations.   2.3 Calculation of final weights of all enablers concerning their enabler categories A pairwise comparison of forty factors categorized under six enabler categories was done by a team of experts where they assigned triangular fuzzy numbers shown in Table 2  : This method discussed above is used to determine the weights of the enabler categories shown in Table 3  . The extent value of each enabler is calculated using equation (2) : G(TG) = (12.00, 16.00, 20.00) ⊗ (79.72, 63.94, 49.04) −1  = (0.15, 0.25, 0.41) G(EV) = (9.20, 11.25, 13.33) ⊗ (79.72, 63.94, 49.04) −1  = (0.12, 0.18, 0.27) G(EN) = (5.40, 7.50, 9.66) ⊗ (79.72, 63.94, 49.04) −1  = (0.07, 0.12, 0.20) G(GT) = (4.74, 6.03, 7.75) ⊗ (79.72, 63.94, 49.04) −1  = (0.06, 0.09, 0.16) G(SC) = (2.60, 2.75, 2.99) ⊗ (79.72, 63.94, 49.04) −1  = (0.03, 0.04, 0.06) G(MK) = (7.40, 10.50, 13.66) ⊗ (79.72, 63.94, 49.04) −1  = (0.09, 0.16, 0.28) The minimum value of each enabler is calculated using equations (6) and (7)  in the steps mentioned below: m(TG) = minV(G1  ≥ Gk ) = 1. Similarly, m(EV) = 0.6202, m(EN) = 0.259, m(GT) = 0.0459, m(SC) = 0.0286, m(MK) = 0.5981. WV  = (1, 0.6202, 0.259, 0.0459, 0.0286, 0.5981)T  Normalized weight: W = (0.3919, 0.2430, 0.1015, 0.0180, 0.0112, 0.2344) Similarly, weights of all enablers are calculated as shown in Table 4  .   3 Results and discussions Results based on the analysis using fuzzy AHP are mentioned in Table 4 , and a brief description is mentioned in the following section:1. Ranking of the categories  2. Ranking of the enablers across the categories - Global ranking  3. Ranking of the enablers within the category - Local ranking    The rank of an enabler in the table shows its extent of criticality and the relevance and importance of these enablers to pine briquettes-based energy generation. Table 4  also represents the global ranks of these enablers. The global rank of an enabler is obtained by the multiplication of the weights of the enabler category and the weight of the enabler itself. These rankings are explained in detail in the following section. 3.1 Ranking of the categories The results show that the enablers grouped under the technology category are the major influencer of the pine needle-based energy generation. This category was then followed by environmental, market, economic, government and lastly, social & community-related enabler categories. Technology-related enablers are key to such interventions using dried and fallen pine needles for energy generation. The second category is environment-related enablers that have a direct impact on the environment by using pine briquettes for the generation of energy. Market-related factors occupy third place, including enabling factors such as good demand for the bio briquettes by the industry, viable fuel linkage, sense of business approach among the main actors, and non-availability of other fuels for self-consumption. Economic enablers are next in importance and majorly include factors such as employment generation, additional income, self-sufficiency etc., making such initiatives attractive enough to be adopted by people. Government and lastly social & community-related enablers are the next categories, in priority for such renewable energy generation-based projects.  3.2 Ranking of the enablers across the categories – global ranking Table 4  shows the global ranking of all enablers across categories. Low maintenance of the machinery used for making briquettes from fallen dried pine needles is the top enabler under global ranking and belongs to technology-related enabler. Controlling forest fires by utilizing pine needles for energy generation, which are a major cause behind these fires is the second-highest ranked individual enabler belonging to environment-related enablers. The third important enabler is minimal technical intervention as the machinery used is non-monotonous, least specialized, protected and involves simple activities that are categorized under technology-related enablers. Viable fuel linkage belonging to market-related enabler is ranked as the fourth enabler. Out of the forty enablers, three enablers falling in the top ten categories are classified under the technology-related enabler category making it an important enabler to pine needle-based energy generation. The lowest-ranked enabler includes enthusiastic entrepreneurs (especially unemployed/educated youth), community cohesion & trust, agendas of individuals, and community participation in forest bio residue resource utilization belongs to the category of social & community-related enabler, making this category least important.  3.3 Ranking of the enablers within the category - local ranking 3.3.1 Technology Technology factors are ranked as the most important enabler among all the categories mentioned. In this category, low maintenance of the machinery used for crushing and making briquettes from the pine needles is ranked as the highest. Minimal technical intervention and easy technology used in the equipment to make briquettes are the next important barriers in this category. The majority of this machinery's users are villagers having little or no technical expertise making these sub-factors major enablers. The efficiency of the machinery available for briquette manufacturing is high. Based on the observation, one machinery could manufacture 1.5 kg/h. Another factor in this category is awareness among villagers who are the ultimate beneficiary of such projects, which mainly traverse through village heads, who are key influencers in the rural areas. Low-cost technology makes such projects attractive and acceptable among the village community.  3.3.2 Environment Environmental factors refer to the sensitivity of people in addressing issues related to the environment as it affects entire humankind directly or indirectly. Controlling forest fires is among the top enabler because pine residue is one of the major causes of forest fires. As per Uttarakhand Forest Department data, pine trees range across half a million hectares of the forest area in the state [6 ]. In 2019, forest fires due to pine residue affected 1244.64 ha of forest. It is a major threat to the vegetation close to the pine forests. Hence, the vegetation safety of nearby broadleaf forests from fire is the second most important enabling factor in this category. Vegetation and other forms of tress may have the scope to rejuvenate. Addressing other environmental issues like soil degradation, water scarcity, wildlife extinction, and a slump in tourism are the next important enablers. Approximately two million tons of dry biomass are produced annually in the form of dried pine needles [6 ,20 ]. Climate change and energy security are other enabling factors as these forest fires are major causes behind climate change. In Uttarakhand, pine needle-led fires discharge approximately 500 million kilograms of carbon dioxide every year into the air [7 ,48 ]. It makes controlling greenhouse gas emissions another key enabler in this category.  3.3.3 Market Enabling factors related to the marketplace have been rated as the third most important factor in pine residue-based energy generation. Viable fuel linkage occupies the top rank in this category. Viable fuel linkage is the backbone of bio residue-based energy generation initiatives. Bio briquettes made from dried pine leaves have a scope of consumption both at commercial and household levels. Sense of business approach among the main actors is ranked second and is a major factor influencing the sustainability of such projects. Good demand for value-added products such as bio briquettes for fuel and smoking purposes. Bio briquettes have good demand as fuel by the sugar industry. Other products such as Lantana Camara briquettes, cottonweed briquettes, and Artemisia indica briquettes can be used for smoking purposes because the smoke produced from them possesses various medicinal properties ranging from antibacterial, anticancer, and anti-fungal. Local procurement by commercial entities is ranked next in this category. Commercial units such as restaurants, and hotels procure this readily available and low-cost fuel for consumption. The next ranked factors carrying less importance include satisfied value chain partners, approachability of these sites and non-availability of other fuels for self-consumption.  3.3.4 Economic Economic enablers are ranked fourth among all the factors. Among these, the employment generation has the highest rank. Hilly regions of Uttarakhand have lesser avenues for employment. Such energy generation projects employ a mass population to collect dried pine needles and manufacture briquettes from them. This helps in generating an additional source of income for the households, which is another driving factor. Females in the hilly terrain, engage themselves in collecting and making briquettes post their household hours to earn additional income for their family and raise their family's well-being. Easy availability of other types of bio residue such as farm residue (rice husk), sawdust ranks next as it ensures continuity of production of briquettes during the off-season when dried pine needles are unavailable. Earning carbon credits is ranked third as it reduces greenhouse gas emissions by removing pine leaves from the forest floor, which is the major cause of forest fire. The abundance and sustainable supply of pine needles in the forests of northwestern Himalayas is the next enabler as approximately 2 million tons of dried fallen leaves are shed in the region every year [6 ,20 ]. Availability of land for grazing purposes, self-sufficiency and the scope of UNFCCC funding are less important factors in this category.  3.3.5 Government and institution Coordination between different government agencies and the strong interface between government and community are the most important driving factors in this category. The second-ranked factor is the presence of proactive field staff from the Government departments. Pine Policy of Uttarakhand introduced in the year 2018 is the next important factor supporting such initiatives. The government has awarded cottage industry status to the activity that further supports and makes it an attractive venture to be opted by people as an income generation activity. Government and departments support such programs, such as one government order related to free transport of dry and fallen pine needles was passed in the year 2016. Leading research and educational institutes of eminence such as the Indian Institute of Technology and the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies support researchers to develop machinery for briquette manufacturing and other value-added products.  3.3.6 Social and community The last category among all the enablers is social and community-related enablers. The primary enabler in this category is a change in peoples' mindset towards such projects. These initiatives will help to protect the environment from forest fires that engulf hectares of forests every year in Uttarakhand. Women empowerment is the next important enabler as these projects involve women in economic activities like briquettes manufacturing from dried pine leaves and other value-added products. This empowers them by making them financially independent. Pride in addressing a social responsibility like climate change issue among all the stakeholders of the program and community participation in forest bio residue resource utilization is the next important enabling factor in this category. Agendas of individuals and community cohesion & trust are the next in the ranking. The last rank in this category is assigned to enthusiastic entrepreneurs, especially unemployed and educated youth, as these energy generation initiatives give them the opportunity for employment generation.   3.4 Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis evaluates the robustness of the proposed framework. Analysis shows that technology-related enablers (TG) with the highest weights are ranked first among all the enabler categories shown in Table 4 . TG may have an impact on the ranking of other enabler categories [27 ]. It would be interesting and useful to analyze the effect on the weights and ranking of other factors on varying weights. Sensitivity analysis was done by changing the values of TG from 0.1 to 0.9 to see the impact on other enablers (Table 5  ). The sensitivity run showed that maximum impact was seen in the weights of environment-related enablers (EV). Further, an impact could be seen on the weights and ranking of other sub-factors on changing weights of TG. In the sensitivity run, when the value of TG is 0.1, EV2 acquires the first rank and SC5 acquires the last rank. At the normalized value, when TG is 0.3919, TG2 holds first rank and EV2 second rank. It is also interesting to note that TG2 remains in the first rank while TG varies from 0.4 to 0.9. Variation in the ranking of other sub-factors is shown in Table 6   and Fig. 7  . It may be concluded that technology-related factors are very important and crucial to mitigate climate change using community-based briquettes manufactured from dried Pine needles for energy generation.   4 Conclusion Climate change is a global challenge and as always, said that ‘emission anywhere affects people everywhere’ therefore it becomes of utmost importance to look for affordable, scalable solutions and enable countries towards a cleaner environment. Pine trees spread across vast forests of Uttarakhand are a major cause of forest fire in the region as dried fallen pine leaves are highly inflammable. There is a need to identify avenues to utilize these leaves to achieve both environmental and socio-economic benefits for the people belonging to the region and the environment as a whole. Energy generation from these fallen leaves has huge potential. This paper identifies and evaluates all the factors that support pine needle-based energy generation using briquettes based on the inputs received from the experts. These enablers were ranked by using fuzzy AHP, which is an MCDM approach. The analysis results show technology-related enablers to be the most important factor supporting pine needle-based energy generation. The order of the criticality of the factors indicates technology-related factors as highest, followed by environmental, market-related, economic, government/institution, and lastly, social/community-related factors. Amongst the ranking of sub-factors across all the categories, low maintenance of machinery is top-ranked. The next ranked important enabler is controlling forest fire, which engulfs hectares of forests every year, causing major loss of flora and fauna and increased pollution levels. Minimal technical intervention is the third important enabling factor, as machinery used in such initiatives does not require any technical expertise and may be resolved with the minimum technological intervention. The reliability of these results was further tested using sensitivity analysis. Making briquettes with pine needles to generate energy for local consumption can be a self-sufficient method of generating green energy to meet the demands of the local and commercial establishments in the neighbouring areas. The idea is plausible and has several driving factors as seen in the literature and substantiated by experts in the energy field. The analysis results in a very logical sequencing of the enablers that will help the government and the policymakers to support climate action, and affordable and clean energy as indicated in the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 by initiating pine needle-based energy generation projects in Uttarakhand. This study also proposes an opportunity to achieve many other sustainable development goals such as gender equality, no poverty, and reduced inequalities.  5 Limitations and future scope of work This study intends to find, categorize, analyze and rank important factors influencing energy generation using dried pine needles in Uttarakhand, India. The findings of the study are centred on the responses obtained from the experts in this area. It is very difficult to remove biases from their opinions and judgements. The findings of this study may not be extended and generalized to energy generation using other forest bio residue. This study can be replicated in other countries with an abundance of pine trees. Another study can be proposed to compare the ranking of the enabling factors to pine-based energy generation initiatives across different countries and developing/developed nations. Additionally, the methodology adopted in this paper can be changed using different MCDM approaches such as TOPSIS, ANP, DEMATEL etc.  Funding source National Mission on Himalayan Studies (NMHS)  for a Project titled “Socio-Economic Value Creation through Forest Bio-Residue Based Energy Generation in alignment with the UN's SDGs".
