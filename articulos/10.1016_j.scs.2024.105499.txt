                  While acknowledging the widespread recognition of artificial intelligence's (AI) potential in achieving sustainable development, there remains a notable deficiency and thorough examination of its specific applications, impacts, and challenges, particularly within the construction industry. A comprehensive investigation is critical to explore and understand the multifaceted applications of AI in fostering sustainability across all phases of a construction project. This paper aims to examine how AI can be effectively integrated across the key project phases—i.e., planning, design, construction, and operation and maintenance, through a systematic literature review to map AI applications, their impacts, adoption challenges, and best practices. The findings revealed: (a) Sustainable development goals (SDGs) pertinent to the construction industry—i.e., SDGs 6-9,11-13,15,17; (b) SDGs that show the highest potential to promote sustainability within the construction industry—i.e., SDGs 7,9,11; (c) Within the spectrum of these goals, AI can potentially transform the construction industry and contribute to the sustainability consideration processes in a more efficient and resilient ways; (d) Ethical considerations, data privacy and security concerns must be addressed, along with an urgent need for specialised training and maintenance of these AI systems; (e) Careful AI implementation and management is essential to harness its full potential, while addressing adoption challenges within the construction sector.

Table 2   AI in Construction Description   Predictive Maintenance AI algorithms can analyse real-time data from sensors embedded in machinery and equipment on construction sites (You et al., 2020 ). By monitoring variables such as temperature, vibration, and usage patterns, AI can predict potential equipment failures before they occur. This enables proactive maintenance, minimising downtime and reducing costly repairs (Yaseen et al., 2020 ).  Safety Monitoring AI-powered cameras and sensors can continuously monitor construction sites in real-time to detect safety hazards such as falls, unauthorised personnel, or equipment malfunctions. These systems can issue alerts to supervisors or automatically shut down operations in hazardous situations, thus improving overall safety on the site (Winge et al., 2019 ).  Resource Optimisation AI algorithms can optimise the use of resources such as materials, labour, and equipment based on real-time data inputs. AI can adjust construction schedules and resource allocations in response to changing weather conditions, material availability, or workforce productivity, thereby maximising efficiency and reducing waste (Ginzburg et al., 2018 ).  Quality Control AI-driven computer vision systems can inspect construction materials and components in real-time to ensure compliance with quality standards and specifications. These systems can detect defects, deviations, or anomalies during the construction process, allowing for immediate corrective actions to be taken to maintain quality standards (Fang et al., 2021 ).     Table 3 Technical uses of artificial intelligence in construction.  Table 3   AI in Construction Description   Data Integration: AI applications in construction rely on integrating data from various sources such as sensors, drones, BIM models, and historical project data. Ensuring seamless data integration requires robust data management systems and interoperability standards to enable AI algorithms to access and analyse diverse data sources effectively (Rakesh et al., 2023 ).  Machine Learning Models AI algorithms used in construction often employ machine learning techniques such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. These models require extensive training on labelled datasets to learn patterns, predict outcomes, and make decisions autonomously (Sacks et al., 2020 ). Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of machine learning models is crucial for their successful deployment in construction applications.  Edge Computing Real-time AI applications in construction often require processing large volumes of data generated by sensors and cameras at the edge of the network, near the construction site. Edge computing technologies enable AI algorithms to run locally on edge devices, reducing latency and bandwidth requirements while ensuring timely decision-making and response in dynamic construction environments (Saeed et al., 2022 ).  Human-AI Collaboration Effective deployment of AI in construction requires collaboration between AI systems and human workers. Human-AI collaboration involves integrating AI tools into existing workflows, providing training and support for workers to interact with AI systems, and leveraging human expertise to interpret AI-generated insights and make informed decisions on construction projects (Sachs et al., 2019 ).

This shift has been characterised by a fundamental redirection in how construction processes are design, planned, and executed (Wang et al., 2023 ). AI's integration has transformed current practices, introducing innovative methodologies and tools that optimise various facets of the construction lifecycle. For instance, AI-powered drones are being used for site surveying and progress monitoring. These drones can quickly and accurately capture data, allowing stakeholders to identify potential issues and make informed decision in real time. It has empowered the industry with predictive analytics, automation, and data-driven insights that streamline workflows, enhance decision-making, and improve overall project outcomes (Pan et al., 2021 ). The 2015 introduction of the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda prompted a strategic shift within the construction industry (General, 2015 ). This shift occurred because the construction industry impacts various dimensions of society, economy, and environment, rendering it a crucial contributor to the realisation of sustainable development goals (SDGs). In shaping the built environment, the industry affects communities, making its role indispensable in advancing the global sustainability agenda outlined by the SDGs (Pan et al., 2023 ). The industry is progressively embracing sustainability principles influenced by the SDGs by incorporating sustainable design, adopting green building standards, concentrating on sustainable materials and technologies, highlighting lifecycle assessment, forging collaborative partnerships, and investing in research and innovation. This alignment with the SDGs is driving the industry towards a more environmentally friendly and inclusive future, with stakeholders throughout the value chain collaborating to accomplish SDGs on a global scale (Bang et al., 2022 ). Moreover, the construction industry is undergoing a significant transformation, acknowledging the imperative to incorporate AI as an essential tool in daily operations (Regona et al., 2022a ). AI's crucial role is evident in its ability to optimise building designs for enhanced energy efficiency and minimised environmental impact. Through extensive data analysis and scenario simulations, AI empowers architects and engineers to make well-informed decisions that comply with rigorous green building standards. In addition to promoting sustainability, AI has played a pivotal role in advancing construction materials and technologies, driving innovation and resilience in structural design (Omer, 2020 ). By harnessing AI algorithms and machine learning techniques, researchers and industry professionals have developed novel materials that enhance the durability, safety, and efficiency of structures. These advancements not only contribute to sustainable construction practices but also address evolving challenges in urbanisation, climate change, and infrastructure development (Yigitcanlar et al., 2008 ). The construction industry is beginning to realise the advantages of sustainable construction practices and technological advancements into their traditional frameworks (Wang et al., 2021 ). This shift signifies a broader recognition of the imperative to mitigate environmental impact and enhance long-term sustainability across all facets of construction activity. As awareness grows regarding the potential advantages of sustainable approaches, stakeholders within the industry are increasingly exploring innovative solutions and integrating them into their established practices (Baduge et al., 2022 ). This evolution reflects a proactive response to emerging global challenges such as, resource depletion, cost overruns, safety issues and urbanisation pressures, signalling a pivotal moment in the industry's journey towards greater resilience and responsibility (Akinosho et al., 2020 ). AI presents itself as a compelling pathway for the construction sector to attain sustainable goals by harnessing its capacity to process vast datasets, anticipate outcomes, and automate tasks. These capabilities serve as a catalyst for driving sustainable practices within construction. Evident by its ability to optimise energy usage in building designs, minimise waste through accurate resource allocation, enhance safety measures by pre-emptively identifying risks, streamline project management for efficiency, ensure real-time compliance with sustainability standards through monitoring, and enable life-cycle assessments for eco-friendly materials (Zhang, 2021 ). These AI-driven tools not only streamline operations but also form the bedrock for advancing the industry's sustainability journey. Despite extensive research on SDGs, a significant research gap exists regarding the construction industry's role in achieving them, particularly concerning AI implementation (Sachs et al., 2019 ). While the industry is vital for sustainability, empirical studies on its contribution to SDGs are limited. This gap highlights the need for focused investigation into aligning construction practices and AI technologies with SDGs to advance global sustainable development (Çetin et al., 2021 ). The intersection of AI, sustainability, and construction remains underexplored, with minimal empirical research on AI's practical applications in enhancing sustainability outcomes in construction projects. Additionally, as AI evolves and becomes more prevalent in construction projects, understanding its coexistence with sustainability is crucial. Existing literature provides theoretical frameworks for addressing broader sustainability aspects of construction projects, but limited sources explore how AI can aid the construction industry in achieving relevant SDGs. This scarcity underscores the need for further exploration and analysis to fully harness AI's potential as a catalyst for sustainable advancements within construction practices (Saeed et al., 2022 ). Bridging this gap requires interdisciplinary collaboration to develop holistic approaches for integrating AI into construction practices. Empirical studies are necessary to identify barriers and opportunities associated with AI adoption in construction, including data privacy, technical challenges, and workforce readiness. Addressing the research gap is crucial for informing policy decisions and industry practices to achieve sustainable development goals effectively. Closing this gap can unlock the construction industry's full potential in advancing sustainability and contributing to SDGs. This study aims to comprehensively explore the intersection of technological innovation, particularly AI, with sustainable construction practices. The objective is to elucidate the role of AI in enhancing sustainability across various phases of construction projects, thereby contributing to the achievement of SDGs. Through an in-depth analysis, the study seeks to identify opportunities and challenges associated with integrating AI-driven solutions in construction processes. Additionally, it aims to provide actionable insights for industry stakeholders on optimal ways of leveraging AI to achieve sustainability outcomes, improve project efficiency, and foster responsible practices within the construction sector. The paper is organised into several sections to provide a structured analysis of the research findings. In Section 3 , the research methodology employed in this study is outlined, detailing the systematic approach adopted to conduct the literature review and map AI applications in the construction industry. Section 4  presents the results and general observations regarding the relevant SDGs in construction, clarifying how AI can contribute to achieving these goals effectively. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the direct and indirect impact of AI on a construction project. In Section 5 , a detailed discussion of the results is offered, providing deeper insights and interpretations into the implications of AI integration for sustainability in the construction sector. Finally, Section 6  concludes the paper by summarising the key findings, discussing their implications for future research and practice, and suggesting potential avenues for further exploration.  2 Literature background 2.1 Sustainable construction At the inaugural First International Conference on Sustainable Construction in November 1994, the concept of sustainability was defined as follows: “Building a healthy built environment through the application of resource-efficient, ecologically sound principles (Poprach et al., 2019 )”. Sustainable construction represents a commitment to three fundamental pillars:■ Economic sustainability involves enhancing profitability by optimising the utilisation of resources, including labour, materials, water, and energy (Oluleye et al., 2022 ).  ■ Environmental sustainability entails preventing harmful and potentially irreversible effects on the environment through prudent use of natural resources, minimising waste generation, and safeguarding (Barros et al., 2021 ).  ■ Social sustainability encompasses meeting the needs of individuals throughout the construction process, from inception to demolition, by ensuring high customer satisfaction and fostering close collaboration with project related stakeholders (Fnais et al., 2022 ).    In traditional design and construction, the focus is on cost, performance, and quality objectives (Opoku et al., 2019 ). However, sustainable design and construction bring in additional considerations, such as minimising resource depletion, reducing environmental degradation, and promoting a healthy built environment. This shift towards sustainability marks a new era within the building design and construction industry, where sustainable goals are embedded in decision-making processes throughout the lifecycle of the facility. Fig. 1   outlines the evolution and challenges of the sustainable construction concept in a global context. In contrast to many other industries, the construction sector in Australia holds a unique position due to its enduring nature and profound, long-lasting impact on society. Buildings and infrastructure developed within this industry can shape communities and landscapes for generations, emphasising the critical importance of thoughtful planning and design (Barbosa Júnior et al., 2023 ). The decisions made during the initial phases of a construction project have far-reaching implications for its sustainable performance over time. For a structure to achieve exemplary performance while minimising its ecological footprint, it is imperative to embed sustainability principles from the outset of the project. This proactive approach ensures that considerations of environmental, economic, and social sustainability are integrated seamlessly into every stage of development and construction. As highlighted by Regona et al. (2022b) , the early incorporation of sustainability principles is fundamental to realising a built environment that not only meets the needs of the present but also safeguards the well-being of future generations. Harmonising the diverse facets of sustainability is essential in achieving sustainable construction practices. This entails not only minimising environmental impact but also fostering economic viability and social equity (Boje et al., 2020 ). Table 1   illustrates the multifaceted nature of sustainability, emphasising the interconnectedness of environmental, economic, and social considerations in construction projects. By embracing this holistic approach, stakeholders can create buildings and infrastructure that not only endure but also contribute positively to the well-being of society and the planet (Gao et al., 2020 ). Drivers for sustainable construction encompass a diverse range of factors that guide the industry towards sustainable beneficial practices (Fayek, 2020 ). These drivers include regulatory frameworks mandating green building standards and emissions reduction targets, increasing consumer demand for eco-friendly and energy-efficient buildings, financial incentives such as tax breaks and subsidies for sustainable projects, innovative technologies and materials that enhance efficiency and minimise environmental impact, as well as broader societal trends emphasising corporate social responsibility, safety, well-being of project stakeholders and long-term viability in their projects and operations (Pizzi et al., 2020 ). Challenges in sustainable construction pose substantial barriers to the broad acceptance of sustainable practices due to several factors. These include the considerable upfront expenses linked to green building materials and technologies, a shortage of skilled labour and proficiency in sustainable construction techniques, complex and inconsistent regulations that hinder adherence to green building criteria, perceived risks and uncertainties regarding the effectiveness and durability of sustainable designs and technologies, and entrenched industry attitudes and practices that favour traditional construction methods. (Fnais et al., 2022 ). Additionally, financing constraints, market barriers, and insufficient awareness or understanding of the benefits of sustainable construction amongst stakeholders further hinder progress towards a more sustainable built environment. Overcoming these barriers requires concerted efforts from governments, industry stakeholders, and the broader community to address policy gaps, promote innovation, provide financial incentives, and foster collaboration towards achieving sustainable development goals. Significant opportunities remain for projects to become more sustainable for the entirety of the building lifecycle (Regona et al., 2023 ). While there are variations from previous studies that investigated the environmental consequences of construction, there appears to be a broad consensus on the need for significant transformation in the industry to embrace sustainability goals and contribute to sustainable development (Wang et al., 2023 ).  2.2 Sustainable development goals in construction SDGs emerged as an outcome of the Rio United Nations Summit in 2013 (Fang et al., 2021 ). The summit concluded by recognising the need to establish global development guidelines that consider human needs, environmental sustainability, human rights, and partnerships (Ma et al., 2019 ). The 17 goals and their 169 targets are structured around the three sustainability pillars – social, environmental, and economic, as seen in Fig. 2  . Unlike the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) predecessor, the SDGs offer better coverage and balance between economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development (Columbus, 2017 ). SDGs represents a comprehensive framework for addressing social, economic, and environmental challenges through predefined targets and indicators (Hovnanian et al., 2019 ). The construction industry has a direct impact on several crucial SDGs, namely SDG 6-9, SDG 11-13, SDG 15, and SDG 17, as illustrated in Fig. 3  . SDG 6, which focuses on clean water and sanitation, is affected by construction projects that can alter water resources and contribute to the development of water infrastructure. SDG 7, concerning affordable and clean energy, intersects with construction through energy consumption and sustainable practices. SDG 8, addressing decent work and economic growth, is influenced by the construction sector's job opportunities and labour practices. SDG 9, emphasising industry, innovation, and infrastructure, is closely tied to construction's role in developing infrastructure and driving economic growth. Additionally, SDGs 11 to 13, which focus on sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, and climate action, are significantly impacted by the construction sector. SDG 11 highlights the critical role of the construction industry in urban development and promoting resilient urban spaces. Furthermore, SDG 12 emphasises resource efficiency and waste reduction through sustainable construction practices such as using recycled materials, minimising waste generation, and promoting circular economy principles. Additionally, SDG 13 underscores the urgent need to adopt low-carbon building materials, energy-efficient design strategies, and climate-resilient infrastructure. Moreover, SDG 15, which addresses life on land, is closely linked to construction practices, particularly concerning land use and biodiversity conservation. Lastly, SDG 17, which emphasises partnerships for all 16 goals, underscores the collaborative efforts required between various stakeholders within the construction industry and beyond to achieve sustainable development objectives. These findings highlight the essential role of the construction industry in advancing SDGs and actively contributing to the global sustainability agenda. While the SDGs are often portrayed as distinct and separate objectives, they are intricately interconnected rather than isolated. This interdependence provides a route for crafting strategic policies and solutions that simultaneously address multiple goals (Nilsson et al., 2016 ). This integrated framework implies that advancements in one target can lead to diverse impacts that influence other targets. Consequently, this raises the potential for unintended consequences arising from trade-offs between goals if policies and actions lack careful planning. Implementing SDGs’ principles in a project presents the construction industry with an opportunity to broaden its focus beyond environmental sustainability. However, achieving these goals isn't solely the responsibility of governments and policymakers; it requires collaborative efforts from various sectors to embed sustainability principles into their practices (Waage et al., 2015 ). To meet the SDGs by the 2030 deadline, it's crucial for all levels of government and sectors of society to integrate these goals into local planning schemes. Local governments have a vital role here, as they can embrace the inclusive nature of the SDGs and identify sectors that may need extra support (Pizzi et al., 2020 ). Therefore, successful implementation relies on effective communication between government, private, and public sectors to come to agreements. By fostering partnerships and facilitating dialogue amongst stakeholders, the construction industry can contribute significantly to advancing the SDGs and promoting sustainable development (Rakesh et al., 2023 ). This collaborative approach not only enhances our ability to address societal and environmental challenges, but also fosters a culture of shared responsibility and innovation essential for lasting impact.  2.3 Artificial intelligence in construction AI is rapidly becoming a cornerstone in the construction industry, reshaping the entire project lifecycle from the design, construction, to the repair and maintenance stage. This transformative evolution is marked by the integration of AI-powered solutions that leverage data analytics, automation, and sophisticated algorithms to optimise every aspect of construction projects (Turner et al., 2020 ). While many definitions exist for AI, it is widely acknowledged that AI within the built environment involves “the creation of intelligent machines and software that emulate cognitive systems for learning and problem-solving” (Baum et al., 2017 ). AI is a broad field of computer science that focuses on creating systems or machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. The following are the three subsets of AI:■ Artificial Intelligence (AI): The broad field of computer science focused on creating intelligent systems capable of tasks requiring human-like intelligence (Baduge et al., 2022 ).  ■ Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI that develops algorithms enabling computers to learn from data and improve performance without explicit programming (Bang et al., 2022 ).  ■ Deep Learning (DL): A subset of ML that automatically employs deep neural networks to learn and represent complex patterns, revolutionising AI applications like image recognition and natural language processing (Baduge et al., 2022 ).    These AI subcategories have garnered increased interest due to notable progress in data collection and consolidation, analytical capabilities, and the availability of adequate computing power. This is evident as the construction industry spent USD 26 billion on engineering and construction technologies from 2014 to 2019, an increase of USD 8 billion over the previous five years (Young et al., 2021 ). In recent years, the construction industry has begun to embrace technology as firms recognise the benefits and operational advantages it offers (Regona et al., 2023 ). This shift reflects a growing awareness amongst industry stakeholders of the transformative potential of technological integration in improving project outcomes and enhancing overall productivity. The adoption of technology in construction holds promise for addressing key challenges faced by the urban built environment, including safety concerns, labour shortages, and cost and schedule overruns (Yun et al., 2016 ). By leveraging innovative technologies, construction companies can navigate these challenges more effectively while also unlocking new opportunities for efficiency and innovation. Tables 2 and 3    provide comprehensive insights into the potential and future real-time and technical applications of AI within the construction industry. The two tables outline the diverse ways in which AI-driven solutions are being deployed to optimise various aspects of construction projects, from real-time monitoring and predictive analytics to advanced automation and decision support systems (Mocerino, 2018 ). By harnessing AI technologies, construction firms can achieve greater precision, accuracy, and efficiency in project execution, thereby improving project outcomes and enhancing overall competitiveness in the market. Moreover, the integration of AI fosters a culture of continuous improvement and innovation within the industry, driving progress towards a more sustainable, resilient, and technologically advanced built environment (Chen et al., 2022 ). These standard technologies allow construction companies to have increased accuracy in data analysis and formulate better strategies that benefit all stakeholders involved (Lee et al., 2018 ). In addition, as projects are temporary and multi-organisational and rely on planning and scheduling models, the construction industry would benefit more than other industries to incorporate technologies (Akinosho et al., 2020 ). Following this introduction and background, the paper is organised into several sections to provide a structured analysis of the research findings. In Section 3 , the research methodology employed in this study is outlined, detailing the systematic approach adopted to conduct the literature review and map AI applications in the construction industry. Section 4  presents the results and general observations regarding the relevant SDGs in construction, clarifying how AI can contribute to achieving these goals effectively. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the direct and indirect impact of AI on a construction project. In Section 5 , a detailed discussion of the results is offered, providing deeper insights and interpretations into the implications of AI integration for sustainability in the construction sector. Finally, Section 6  concludes the paper by summarising the key findings, discussing their implications for future research and practice, and suggesting potential avenues for further exploration.   3 Methodology This study aims to outline key AI technologies aiding the construction industry in achieving the UN's SDGs. Integrating AI can enhance construction efficiency, sustainability, and alignment with SDG principles. A systematic literature review was conducted which adheres to the PRISMA protocol and ensures research replicability (see http://prisma-statement.org ). The chosen methodology was based on the structured and unbiased synthesis that systematic reviews offer. By providing comprehensive overviews of existing research on specific topics, they inform decision-making and guide future actions across various fields as seen in Table 4  . AI-related literature is exclusively sourced from reputable academic journals, covering established and emerging technologies. By examining current applications, maturity levels, and their potential to address sustainability challenges, this study provides insights crucial for advancing sustainable practices in construction. Stage 1 (planning stage) focused on the included research objectives that answer the research questions, keywords, and a set of exclusion and inclusion criteria. The primary aim of this study is to identify and highlight the predominant AI technologies that are making significant contributions towards achieving the UN's sustainability goals. While some research papers examine effective construction methods that contribute to sustainability objectives, there needs to be more research analysing the prevalent AI technologies employed across the four primary phases of Construction. Based on the literature analysis conducted, it was found that nine SDGs emerged as frequently mentioned and emphasised across various studies and sources as seen in Table 5  . These SDGs represent key areas of focus and priority for policymakers, organisations, and stakeholders involved in sustainable development efforts. The following 26 keywords were used to form a defined a search criteria: “Artificial Intelligence” AND “Sustainability” AND “Construction Industry” OR “Buildings” OR “Construction Projects” OR “UN Sustainable Development Goals” OR “Development Goals” OR “Automation” OR “Robotics” OR “Urban Development” OR “AI Application” OR “Sustainable Building Design” OR “Sustainable Urban Planning” OR “Sustainable Architecture” OR “Renewable Energy” OR “Energy Efficiency” OR “Green Building” OR “Sustainable Materials” OR “Waste Reduction” OR “Climate Change” OR “Emissions” OR “Lifecycle” OR “Civil Construction”. Based on the findings from the literature review, keywords co-occurrences for AI in Construction concerning sustainability development goals were established. The results showed that 38 broad technology themes are co-occurrent with sustainability goals. Additional keywords were analysed but did not establish or identify other technology areas. Seven of the thirty-eight key AI themes were frequently mentioned in the journal articles, namely, Decision support systems (n  = 230), Machine learning (n  = 159), Internet of things (n  = 128), Automation (n  = 109), Big data (n  = 76), Deep Learning (n  = 76) and Robotics (n  = 55). The clustering of central keywords not only outlined the research landscape's boundaries but also a comprehensive overview of AI technologies that showcase a notable alignment with the sustainability goals of the United Nations. The keyword search was conducted in July 2023 and obtained 1490 results that met the stipulated search parameters (from January 2000 to July 2023). Following the removal of duplicated journal articles, the retained count settled at 1358 papers, encompassing research contributions that extend beyond the confines of the university library database. The search mechanism encompassed over 400 bibliographic repositories, notably bibliographic repositories such as Scopus, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, the Directory of Open Access Journals and Wiley Online Library. As demonstrated in Table 6  , a set of criteria was systematically formulated to curtail the volume and intricacy of the forthcoming review process, thereby facilitating efficient article screening. In this context, primary data encompasses research outputs meticulously generated by individuals, serving as purposeful tools for comprehending and resolving intricate research questions. Conversely, secondary data assumes the form of research contributions from governmental bodies and construction institutions, collectively contributing to the knowledge landscape. In stage 2 (review stage), the remaining 1263 articles were assessed against category formulation, as seen in Table 7  . As a result of this evaluation, the articles were further refined, which resulted in 578 remaining articles. The title, abstract and keywords of the remaining 578 articles were screened according to the exclusion criteria and the number of relevant articles was eventually reduced to 91. In Stage 3 (reporting), the screening processes aimed to analyse the selected articles according to pre-defined categories to assess similarities and differences (Yigitcanlar et al., 2021a ). The four-step method was then used to classify the reviewed literature into specific themes (Butler et al., 2020 ; Yigitcanlar et al., 2021b ). The first step highlighted significant technologies that play a part in reducing carbon emissions and helping meet sustainability goals. Secondly, the most important ranked themes were categorised and reviewed as aligned with the research aims. The third step was cross-checking the categories with other review studies and identifying any additional relevant SDG in construction. Lastly, the themes were categorised and finalised in the planning, design, construction operation and maintenance under common themes. Fig. 4   displays the overview of the process of selecting papers. Subsequently, the selected papers were examined and categorised based on the specific sustainability development goals (SDGs) they addressed and AI sub-categories that were frequently mentioned in the articles. Additionally, the papers were later organised based on the direct and indirect relationships between SDG targets and the construction industry, as seen in Fig. 5  . They were then assessed to determine which specific AI subcategory would exert the most significant influence on each respective target. Other relevant peer-reviewed studies further evaluated these overarching themes. Additionally, the chosen articles were segmented into four distinct phases: the 'planning phase' (n  = 21), the 'design phase' (n  = 25), the actual 'construction phase' (n  = 27), and the subsequent phases of 'operation and maintenance' (n  = 18). Each phase involves common and distinct AI technologies, which vary in impact on the associated SDG.  4 Results 4.1 General observations The number of publications published in recent years has shown the increased interest in AI helping the built environment become more environmentally sustainable. This is evident as 78% of the 91 articles were published in the last three years (5 in 2020, 9 in 2021, 25 in 2022 and 22 in 2023). Many of the authors were affiliated with academic institutions in China (n  = 12), Australia (n  = 9) and the United States (n  = 8). This global distribution signifies collaborative efforts in utilising AI to address ecological challenges in the industry. China's significant representation underscores its commitment to innovative solutions, while Australia and the United States demonstrate their dedication to sustainable construction practices. This collective international engagement highlights AI's potential for fostering sustainability in construction on a worldwide scale. As shown in Fig. 6  , the growth of AI literature concerning environmentally sustainable practices has drastically increased in recent years. The articles were categorised and analysed based on how often different AI sub-categories were mentioned, as detailed in Table 8  . These findings consistently highlight the importance of AI-related tasks across various project phases. The prevalence of AI tasks across these phases emphasises its significance, showcasing its broad applicability and central role in addressing diverse project needs. ML appears regularly as a contributor, with varying levels of involvement, indicating its supportive role in phases where data-driven approaches are crucial. While DL's consistently lower presence suggests a more specialised application within the project, emphasising its relevance in specific areas where its unique capabilities are essential. In the context of leveraging AI to enhance sustainability within construction projects, an analysis of 91 articles revealed a distinct pattern: only two authors emerged as contributors to more than one paper: Frahzadil (n  = 2) and Kiomarsi (n  = 2). An assessment of the author's h-index scores highlighted three prominent researchers: Kovac (n  = 38), Banins (n  = 33) and Clements-Croom (n  = 28). These scores recognise the influence of these authors in utilising AI to advance sustainability within construction contexts. Interestingly, no single author held a dominant position in the literature. The contributions were widespread across various authors, outlined the diverse and collaborative nature of the literature, and depicted a range of viewpoints and cumulative knowledge. Given the specific focus on AI and sustainability in the literature review, it is unsurprising that a significant portion of the articles (n  = 10) were published in the Sustainability journal. These papers addressed the entire lifecycle of construction. The remaining papers were published in 38 journals, focusing on sustainability and how construction projects can utilise AI technologies to reduce carbon emissions, efficient energy consumption, and project waste. Table 9   presents the relevant SDG and which construction phases were frequently mentioned within the papers. It is essential to highlight that several SDGs are not inherently aligned with the core functions of the construction industry, as seen in Table 10  . While the construction sector plays a crucial role in shaping our built environment, fostering economic growth, and enhancing infrastructure, it does not directly address or encompass the entire spectrum of SDGs, as seen in Table 2 . These goals, each addressing distinct global challenges, require specialised approaches and interventions outside the immediate purview of construction. For instance, SDG 1 focuses on addressing poverty, which requires a broader set of economic and social policies that extend beyond the construction industry's primary functions. Similarly, SDG 2, which seeks to achieve zero hunger, is primarily concerned with food security, an area unrelated to the construction's primary function of building physical infrastructure. Further, although the construction sector can impact worker health and safety, it needs to encompass the comprehensive healthcare and well-being objectives of SDG 3. While construction projects can contribute to educational initiatives, such as constructing schools, the industry itself does not serve as the primary driver of the educational goals central to SDG 4. Gender equality, a pivotal issue in SDG 5, remains a critical social concern but isn't the principal focus of the construction sector, despite ongoing efforts to foster gender diversity and equality within it. Income inequality, a central theme of SDG 10, is indirectly influenced by the construction industry through job creation and wage structures, but addressing income inequality is not the core mission of the sector. SDG 14, addressing life below water, is unrelated to construction, an industry predominantly on land, with no direct impact on marine ecosystems. Lastly, establishing peace, justice, and strong institutions, as mentioned in SDG 16, does not fall within the immediate purview of the construction industry, as this goal primarily involves governance, law enforcement, and related matters.  4.2 Sustainable development goals and artificial intelligence in construction The pivotal role of the construction sector in driving societal development and infrastructure creation underscores the urgent imperative to achieve nine directly related sustainable SDGs goals. Embracing AI within the construction industry has emerged as a critical strategy for projects to elevate sustainability efforts while pursuing SDGs. The seamless fusion of SDGs and AI technologies within construction underscores their transformative potential, catalysing a significant reshaping of the construction landscape. However, the literature review highlights the imperative for the construction industry to expedite the integration of AI and SDGs, attributed to the growing complexity of construction projects and a tendency to prioritise economic gains over environmental and social considerations (Egwim et al., 2021 ). As such, there is a pressing need for concerted efforts from all relevant stakeholders to actively contribute to attaining these crucial goals. Collaboration amongst industry stakeholders is essential to promote sustainable practices that align with the SDGs (Pan et al., 2023 ). Governments can implement supportive policies, local communities can ensure projects meet their needs and adhere to sustainability principles, construction companies can invest in green solutions, and architects and engineers can incorporate sustainable designs (Grabowska et al., 2022 ). This collective effort advances the SDGs and establishes new industry standards, becoming a global model for sustainable construction practices. 4.2.1 SDG 6: clean water and sanitation Providing clean water and sanitation is considered in SDG 6, which consists of 8 targets and 11 indicators. The main objectives centre around water and sanitation availability and sustainability management that promotes responsible construction practices. Construction projects demand substantial water for concrete mixing, dust control, and site preparation. Construction organisations must protect freshwater bodies near construction sites from contamination (Opoku, 2022 ). The design of intelligent, innovative, and sustainable buildings offers improvement in water use and could contribute to minimising its impact on the natural environment.
