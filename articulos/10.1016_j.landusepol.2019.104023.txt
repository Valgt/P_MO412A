                  Significant manifestations of adverse effects of climate change exist for crop agriculture throughout the developing world including Bangladesh. Despite wheat being the second most important staple food, any rigorous analysis of its sensitivity to climate change remains an unexplored area of research. This paper fills this gap by investigating wheat yield sensitivity to climate change over time and across climatic zones using 45-year district level panel data. Results revealed rising trends in average seasonal temperature and number of seasonal dry days and downward trends in planting and flowering stage rainfall. The rise in average temperature and number of dry days adversely affected wheat yield while greater planting and flowering stage rainfall has improved yield. Significant variations across regions and a positive trend over time were evident. The study’s policy implications are explored in terms of the potential to expand wheat cultivation and its role in achieving SDG 2 regarding food security and SDG 6 concerning sustainable water management. Strengthening institutional support systems, market accessibility, science-driven climate change adaptations - including generation and dissemination of drought tolerant wheat varieties and enhancing farmers’ capacity to switch from rice to wheat, constitute key areas of policy intervention critically important for achieving SDG 2 and SDG 6.

Significant manifestations of adverse effects of climate change exist for crop agriculture throughout the developing world including Bangladesh. Despite wheat being the second most important staple food, any rigorous analysis of its sensitivity to climate change remains an unexplored area of research. This paper fills this gap by investigating wheat yield sensitivity to climate change over time and across climatic zones using 45-year district level panel data. Results revealed rising trends in average seasonal temperature and number of seasonal dry days and downward trends in planting and flowering stage rainfall. The rise in average temperature and number of dry days adversely affected wheat yield while greater planting and flowering stage rainfall has improved yield. Significant variations across regions and a positive trend over time were evident. The study’s policy implications are explored in terms of the potential to expand wheat cultivation and its role in achieving SDG 2 regarding food security and SDG 6 concerning sustainable water management. Strengthening institutional support systems, market accessibility, science-driven climate change adaptations - including generation and dissemination of drought tolerant wheat varieties and enhancing farmers’ capacity to switch from rice to wheat, constitute key areas of policy intervention critically important for achieving SDG 2 and SDG 6.   Keywords Climate change  Wheat yield  Panel data  Food security  Sustainable water management  Bangladesh    1 Introduction Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG2) adopted by the United Nations (UN) in 2015 envisions zero hunger. More specifically, it “…seeks sustainable solutions to end hunger in all its forms by 2030 and to achieve food security” and promises to “…end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture” (United Nations, 2015 ). Closely related to SDG2 is SDG6 which underscores the need for ensuring availability and sustainability of water management. Target 6.4 specifically emphasizes increasing water-use efficiency across all sectors, sustainable water withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address economic or physical water scarcity (Target 6b). Growing populations and a dwindling supply of arable land per capita in densely populated countries especially those in South Asia, are factors which are necessitating a sustainable increase in agricultural production. Among the means to achieve this is minimizing food losses due to climate change and climate related extreme events. However, year-to-year non-stationary climatic trends pose a potent threat to agricultural crop production (Gourdji et al., 2015 ; Wang et al., 2019 ). Though anthropogenic warming of the planet has had an influence on many physical, biological and environmental systems (IPCC, 2007 , 2014 ), agriculture has always been considered the most vulnerable sector (Chauhan et al., 2005 ; De Costa et al., 2007 ; Halkos and Tsilika, 2017 ; Mani et al., 2018 ; World Bank, 2011 , 2013 ; Zhang et al., 2018 ). This study espouses two broad objectives. First it examines trends in climatic variables and the sensitivity of wheat yield to climate change over time and across the key wheat growing climatic zones using a 45-year period panel data. Second, it explores the implications for Bangladesh’s prospects of achieving SDG2 (food security) and SDG6 (sustainable water management) by expanding wheat cultivation. This paper contributes to the existing literature in three important ways. First, it uses a richer dataset on both traditional (temperature and rainfall) and non-traditional but important climate variables (bright sunshine and Seasonal relative humidity) to assess their effects on wheat yield. Second, it uses an innovative analytical framework which can be adapted to other countries with similar bio-physical characteristics. Finally, the study explores policy implications for augmenting wheat production compatible with sustainable food security (SGD 2) and sustainable water management (SGD 6). Wheat is highly susceptible to climate change, particularly to increased temperature, drought and humidity. Asseng et al. (2015)  projected that an increase of 1 °C in temperature was likely to decrease wheat yields globally by 6%. Such a substantial predicted decrease in wheat yield has the potential to threaten global food security and increase the incidence of world hunger. This consequently calls for reducing agricultural crop losses by ameliorating unreliable weather effects (Alauddin and Sarker, 2014 ; Hasan et al., 2016 ; Islam et al., 2017 ). Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change due to her unique physio-graphic and socio-economic characteristics (World Bank, 2013 ; Hasan et al., 2016 ; MoEF, 2017 ; Mani et al., 2018 ). In recent decades, Bangladesh has witnessed a higher incidence of recurrent natural hazards (Rashid, 1991 ; Islam, 2009 ; Alamgir et al., 2015 ). The IPCC (2007 ; 2014)  projected that by 2050, Bangladesh will experience an average temperature rise by 1.4 °C (±0.16 °C). Despite no appreciable changes in total annual rainfall, the number of days without rain has risen. This erratic and uneven pattern of rainfall is primarily responsible for extreme droughts and floods (Islam et al., 2016 ; Sarker et al., 2012 ). Moreover, Bangladesh is likely to face an increased number of warmer days, heat waves, longer dry spells and higher drought risks. Rahman and Lateh (2016)  reported that, of the 13 severe droughts which Bangladesh suffered in the four decades to 2010, those that occurred since the 1990s are likely to be related to climate change. The severity of these climatic events heavily damaged crop production, undermined overall agricultural production and economic growth (Fankhauser and Tol, 2005 ; Dell et al., 2012 ). Overall these events exemplified the increasing fragility of the state of food security in Bangladesh. Bangladesh is still predominantly an agro-based economy (Sabiha et al., 2018 ). Even though the relative contribution of agriculture to Bangladesh’s GDP has decreased to less than a fifth due to a significant expansion of the industrial and service sectors, it still employs more than two-fifths of the total labour force (GoB, 2016 ). The performance of this sector therefore significantly affects major macroeconomic objectives including employment, poverty alleviation, human resources development and food security. Of all Bangladesh’s cereal crops, wheat is the second most important. Its cultivation covers 445 thousand ha and produced 1.348 million MT of grains in 2016-17 (GoB, 2017 ). However, this level of wheat output falls far short of the demand making Bangladesh highly dependent on wheat imports which reached 3.65 million MT in 2016-17 (GoB, 2017 ). The demand for wheat is growing every year due to rising population, its use in the bakery industry and people’s health awareness in terms of dietary preference. The glycaemic index (a globally accepted index for measuring blood glucose release) of wheat (62 ± 3) is significantly lower than that of rice (73 ± 4) (Atkinson et al., 2008, p.2282 ; see also Rozendaal et al., 2018 ; Jenkins et al., 1981 ). Therefore, a growing number of diabetic patients in Bangladesh (Biswas et al., 2016 ) are changing their food preference from rice to wheat – a trend similar to that in India (Amarasinghe et al., 2007 ). Wheat import increased significantly as domestic production has not kept pace with rising demand over the years. Bangladesh imported 24% of its total wheat consumption in the early 2000s while by 2016–2017 the imported wheat constituted 82% of requirement (GoB, 2018 ). Fig. 1  (a) displays the import intensity, while 1(b) shows the relative percentage of imported rice and wheat in total food grain imports during 1972–2016. Bangladesh imported more than 10% of the total quantity of available food grains (rice + wheat) in the early 1970s compared to considerably less than 10% during the last 15 years or so - even though the population has more than doubled over that period. A characteristic feature of foodgrain imports is that the volume of wheat imported has been considerably higher than that of rice over the entire length of the time series except for 1998 when rice import marginally exceeded that of wheat. It is noted that excessive import dependence may not only strain Bangladesh’s fragile balance of payments but also make it more vulnerable to food insecurity and undermine sustainable development (CIMMYT, 2017 ; Dioume, 2015 ). Hence, a reduction in import dependency and to meet rising demand warrants a focus on augmenting domestic wheat production. However, wheat yield volatility, strongly associated with unreliable weather effects due to changing climatic patterns, risks achieving this goal. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2  describes trends in wheat production while Section 3  reviews the relevant literature. Section 4  is devoted to analytical materials and methods. Section 5  analyses and discusses the empirical results. Section 6  explores prospects for expanding the area under wheat cultivation and its implications for SDG2 and SDG6. Section 7  presents a summary of conclusions and explores policy implications.  2 Trends in wheat production and nutritional status: an overview Aggregate wheat production in Bangladesh has increased over the years albeit  with periodic fluctuations. Fig. 2  (a) presents wheat area, production and yield over the 45-year period to 2016. Wheat yield portrayed on the right vertical axis typifies a high level of variability. National average wheat yield since 2013 has exceeded 3000 kg ha−1  with the highest figure of 3080 kg ha−1  recorded in 2015. Immediately after Bangladesh’s independence in 1971, wheat production was sluggish because of post-war shocks and natural disasters as well as the low level of cultural and social acceptability of wheat (Ahmed and Meisner, 1996 ). However, its social and cultural acceptability gained momentum in the early 1980s. At the same time, wheat production increased dramatically due to the adoption of green revolution technologies during the1990s (Alauddin and Hossain, 2001 ) albeit  from a very low base. After reaching a peak production level of 1908 thousand MT and a peak cultivated area of 882 thousand ha in 1999, both fell sharply due to loss of cultivated land and the wheat blast epidemic (BARI, 2017 ) before reaching their lowest levels in 2006. Since 2007 production has increased significantly to around 1348 thousand MT while the area under cultivation has remained steady at around 400–450 thousand ha. This increase in wheat production is due primarily to increased yield as explained in the discussion surrounding Table 1   later in this section. Fig. 2 (b) presents the comparative trends over time for wheat yields for Bangladesh’s five major wheat growing regions. A closer inspection of the information contained in Fig. 2 (b) suggests that the regions display broadly similar time patterns to that for Bangladesh as a whole even though there are significant interregional differences. Information underlying Fig. 2  (Panel A and Panel B) indicates five episodic patterns that broadly correspond to the following sub-periods:1 1980: early green revolution phase  2 1990: early expanding phase  3 1999: advanced expanding phase  4 2006: declining phase  5 2016: research-led recovery phase    Table 1  summarises the salient features of growth and changes in wheat cultivation for Bangladesh as a whole according to the five periods identified above. Compared to Phase 1, wheat output in Phase 2 (1981–1990) and Phase 3 (1991–1999) increased by 324% and 372% respectively. The increment declined to 272% during Phase 4 (2000–2006) before rising to 310% in Phase 5 (2007–2016). After increasing by 26% in Phase 2 over Phase 1, average wheat yield registered marginal increases during Phase 3 and Phase 4. In contrast, Phase 5 experienced a significant 73% increase in yield over Phase 1. The wheat output increase during the pre-2007 period resulted primarily from an expansion in area while the output increases since 2007 were primarily due to rising yields. Scientific breakthroughs in wheat research in the last two decades appear to have underpinned the yield increases. The varieties released by the Wheat Research Centre (WRC) and Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) possessed pest and disease resistance as well as drought tolerant characteristics reducing risk and uncertainty reducing in wheat cultivation. Consequently, both output and yield are shown to be more stable during Phase 5 at higher levels as indicated by their respective coefficients of variation. Before 1998 different local and international varieties of wheat such as Sonora  64, Kalyansona , Sonalika , Ananda , Kanchan , Barkat  and Akba r were widely cultivated in Bangladesh (Ahmed and Meisner, 1996 ). Since the mid-1990s onwards, several new high yielding varieties (HYVs) have been released for adoption by farmers in the face of climate change (http://baritechnology.org/en/home/tech_commodity#result ). Among these new varieties BARI Gom 30, BARI Gom 24 (Prodip), BARI Gom 23 (Bijoy) are now widely cultivated by farmers in all Bangladesh’s wheat growing regions. It is noteworthy that BARI Gom  33 developed in 2017 is more heat-tolerant while at the same time being high yielding. However, at this point of time, it has yet to be widely adopted by farmers. Bangladesh’s high poverty and undernutrition rates are exacerbated by the frequency and severity of natural disasters and high population density. During the period 2009–2014, Bangladesh suffered an estimated financial loss of approx. US$ 2.3 billion from natural disasters including floods, cyclones, river erosion, and droughts the respective proportions of the total damages being crops - 36.2%, livestock - 4.76% and land degradation - 26.72% (BBS, 2015 ). The number of undernourished people in Bangladesh stood at 24 million during 2014–2016 (FAO et al., 2017 ), a decline from 26.5 million during 2010–2012 (FAO et al., 2015 ). However, a significant decline of 27% can be noted from the 1990–1992 figure of 36 million (FAO et al., 2015 ). Reflecting these improvements Bangladesh’s ranking in the 2010 Human Development Index (HDI) put it in 3rd quartile (136/189, i.e., above 28% of countries) in 2018 up from its previous 4th quartile ranking (129/169, i.e., above 23.7% of countries (UNDP, 2016 ), i.e., above 14.1% of countries). This epitomizes Bangladesh’s steady progress in HDI ranking which stood at 0.608 in 2018 up from 0.545 in 2010, 0.468 in 2000 and 0.386 in 1990 (UNDP, 2017 ). Moreover, Bangladesh transitioned in the Global Hunger Index (GHI) to the 3rd quartile (86/119, i.e., above 26.1% of countries) in 2018 up from the 4th quartile (68/79 i.e., above 14.1% of countries) in 2012 (FAO, 2018 ; IFPRI, 2017 ). These improvements notwithstanding, Bangladesh, with a GHI score of 26.1 in 2018 Bangladesh suffers from a level of hunger considered serious 1  1 GHI Severity Scale ≤ 9.9 (low), 0.0–19.9 (moderate), 20.0–34.9 (serious), 35.0–49.9 (alarming), ≥ 50.0 (extremely) alarming.   (https://www.globalhungerindex.org/ ).  3 Literature review A substantial body of research has assessed the impacts of climate change on wheat production in a global context. Studies assessing long-term yield responses to climate change have used growing season temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation. For example, wheat yields have declined with warmer temperatures (Hawker and Jenner, 1993 ; Jenner, 1994 ; Stone and Nicolas, 1994 , 1995a , 1995b ; Yang et al., 2002 ; Shah and Paulsen, 2003 ; Wollenweber et al., 2003 ; Spiertz et al., 2006 ; Zhao et al., 2007 ; Asseng et al., 2015 ; Hernandez-Ochoa et al., 2018 ). Studies using simulation models have reported similar findings for Australia (Gifford et al., 1998 ; Godden et al., 1998 ; Asseng et al., 2011 ; Luo et al., 2018 ), China (Yang et al., 2017 ) and Denmark (Patil et al., 2012 ; Ozturk et al., 2017 ). However, Fischer and Maurero (1976)  and Rane and Nagarajan (2004)  found wheat yield to be less sensitive to temperature variation than the above studies. Turner and Asseng (2005)  and Yu et al. (2014)  and Mäkinen et al. (2018)  identified precipitation as a risk-decreasing climate factor. Solar radiation appeared to be an impediment to realizing wheat yield potential in Spain and Mexico (Villegas et al., 2017 ; Hernández-Barrera and Rodríguez-Puebl, 2017 ). In an investigation of the impacts of climate change on wheat production in four Central Asian countries (Kazakhastan, Kyrgystan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan) employing the CropSyst model, Sommer et al. (2013)  found that an increase in temperature had a significant positive impact on wheat yield. Research on the impact of climate change and cereal production in Bangladesh indicates that inadequate attention has been paid to the relationship between wheat yields and climate. Hossain and Da Silva (2012)  reported a negative relationship between wheat yield and heat stress. However, this study was not based on rigorous statistical analysis but on observations and reviews of past studies. Miah et al. (2014)  found that key climate variables (temperature and rainfall) had a significant impact on the incomes of wheat producers in Bangladesh. Increasing temperature was found to decrease net revenue while the opposite was the case with rainfall. Late or early sowing had an adverse effect on wheat yield (Jahan et al., 2018 ). Hussain et al (2012)  noted optimum sowing time to be the second week of November through to the first week of December. They further reported that at least 80% of wheat is grown in rice-wheat crop rotation with a late planting rate of about 50% with the consequence of significant yield loss. Schlenker and Roberts (2008)  found that wheat yield response from small changes in climate variables was too small to attribute the exact nature of adverse effects using their simulation models. The Amin et al. (2015)  study is the only one to use an empirical model to measure the climate-crop relationship in Bangladesh and which includes wheat. Their findings indicated no significant effect of climate variables except maximum temperature which had a negative impact on wheat yield. While Amin et al. (2015)  provided useful information through the use of econometric techniques, the study suffers from several limitations. First, the study used national level aggregate data which masks regional patterns. Second, they used total rainfall growing season data rendering them inadequate for developing stage-specific (planting, flowering, harvesting) impacts of rainfall on wheat yield. Third, they ignored the role of seasonal dry days which is an important factor in the west climatic zone (E), a key wheat growing region of Bangladesh (GoB, 2016 ) but is a severely drought-prone and groundwater depleted area (Alauddin and Sharma, 2013 ; Alauddin and Sarker, 2014 ; Rahman and Lateh, 2016 ). As the first study of its kind for Bangladesh, this research displays novelty in analyzing the stage-specific rainfall impacts on wheat yield which is mostly a rain-fed crop. The study departs from previous research by defining the total number of dry days during the wheat growing period and, therefore, accounts for long dry spells that may be associated with drought-related crop yield declines. The primary objective of this study is to assess the impact of climate change on wheat yield in Bangladesh. It commences with an analysis of climate trends using 45 years (1972–2016) of climate data for the major wheat growing areas. A regression model is then applied to the panel data to estimate the effect of climate trends on wheat yield.  4 Materials and methods 4.1 Major wheat growing areas, their physiographic characteristics and relative significance Bangladesh is divided into seven major climatic regions: South-east (A), North-east (B), Northern parts of north (C), North-west (D), West (E), South-west (F) and Mid-south (G) (Fig. 3  ). Appendix Table A1  presents the physiographic characteristics, a profile of wheat cultivation in each of the districts and their relative significance in the national context. South-east (A) and North-east (B) with 30% of Bangladesh’s geographical area produce less than 0.6% of wheat output. Northern parts of north (C), North-west (D), and West (E) are the key wheat growing areas with a combined wheat output share of 75% in 2016–2017. West (E) is the most wheat intensive region with 5.3% of Bangladesh’s land area producing 21.2% of national wheat output. This is followed by Northern parts of north (C) and North-west (D) wwhich accounted for 9% and 13.6% of Bangladesh’s area respectively but produced 30.4% and 25.3% of national wheat output in 2016–2017. Apart from these three key wheat growing areas, the South-west (F, 13.4% of land area) and Mid-south regions (G, 9.1% of land area) are significant wheat producing areas with a combined national output share of 22.5%. Given the negligible contributions of South-east (A) and North-east (B) zones to wheat production, they are excluded from the econometric analysis undertaken in Section 5 .  4.2 Datasets The monthly weather datasets: average maximum temperature (°C), average minimum temperature (°C), total rainfall (mm), average bright sunshine (hours), and average seasonal relative humidity (%), were collected from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department. This study also used daily records of rainfall to determine the number of days without rain during the wheat growing season. These historical meteorological data from 1972 to 2016 are employed to assess climatic trends. The annual monthly temperature (maximum and minimum) variables are firstly transformed into monthly average temperature (average of the monthly average maximum temperature and monthly average minimum temperature), and monthly temperature range (difference between monthly average maximum temperature and monthly average minimum temperature). Then, monthly average temperature and monthly temperature range are converted to a seasonal average. The same procedure was followed for monthly average bright sunshine and monthly average relative humidity to derive their seasonal averages. The rainfall data were divided into three parts (planting time, flowering time, and harvesting time) to capture the distinct rainfall effects for each period. For the wheat growing season, this study uses two calendar years. The planting period November-December are for previous year and January-April for the following year. Data on wheat yield (kg/ha) from 1972 to 2016 were culled from the various issues of the Yearbook of Agricultural Statistics of Bangladesh. The summary statistics of wheat yield and climate variables are reported in Table 2  . The variations in all three rainfall variables are more noticeable than those in other variables. Four distinct climatic seasons can be recognized: dry winter (December-February), pre-monsoon (March-May), monsoon (June-September), and post-monsoon (October-November). The crop-growing period in Bangladesh is divided into pre-kharif  (March-May), kharif  (May-October), and rabi  (November-February). The Rabi  season covers the months with little or almost no rainfall.  4.3 Regression model specification We define a regression model for cross-sectional time series of regional yield and weather data in the major wheat producing areas as follows:(1) ln yieldit  = β 0  + β 1  average seasonal temperatureit   + β 2  Seasonal temperature rangeit   +β 3  planting stage rainfallit   + β 4  flowering stage rainfallit   + β 5  harvesting stage rainfalli  t + β 6  number of seasonal dry daysit  + β 7  bright sunshineit  + β 8  seasonal relative humidityit  + β 9  trendit   + β 10  time dummy (1981-2006)t  + β 11  time dummy (2007-2016)t  + β 12  northern parts of northi   + β 13  north westi   + β 14  westi   + β 15  south westi   + εit     where, i  = northern parts of north (C), north-west (D), west (E), south-west (F) t  = time dummy (1981–2006 = 1, 0 otherwise), time dummy (2007–2016 = 1, 0 otherwise) β 0 =  intercept ε  = random disturbance term This study employs a fixed effect model instead of a random effect model in order to highlight issues of regional differences and the possibility of correlation between regressors and time-invariant distinctiveness (Sarker et al., 2014 ). This allows region-specific characteristics to be included which are one of the reasons of using this model. In contrast, random effects model necessitates the assumption of no correlation between unobserved time-invariant characteristics and explanatory variables. This selection is consistent with past studies (McCarl et al., 2008 ; Kim and Pang, 2009 ; Cabas et al., 2010 ). In addition to weather variables, time trend, and regional dummies are also included in the model. Four regional dummies for five regions are used to avoid the dummy variable trap. The two time trend dummies attempt to capture technological progress over time while regional dummies characterize the estimation of relatively static soil and management differences across the regions in the mean yield function. Finally, a three-stage feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) method is run in preference to the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to estimate the fixed effect panel model because of the large sample size (N  = 5 (climatic zones) x 45 (years) = 225). However, controlling the impact of unobserved heterogeneity presented by the incidental parameters to obtain valid inference of the structural parameters poses a challenge for panel data methodology (Hsiao, 2003 ).   5 Results and discussion 5.1 Climate trends Table 3   reports significant trends in climate variables for major wheat growing regions of Bangladesh. Trends in harvesting rainfall and Seasonal temperature range are not statistically significant and are not reported here for brevity. Rising temperature affected 85% of the wheat growing areas in Bangladesh. The wheat growing season has witnessed warmer temperatures in all wheat growing areas except the South-west (F). Significant declining trends can be observed in rainfall during the planting and flowering periods in Northern parts of the north (C), Northwest (D) and West (E) affecting three-quarters of the total wheat growing area in Bangladesh. This underscores the need for supplementary irrigation for wheat cultivation. The number of seasonal dry days has shown an increasing trend in regions C, D, and E which may be associated with drier weather for cultivated areas facing drought related risk. Bright sunshine demonstrates a downward trend only in the Southwest (F) which has 14% of the total wheat area of Bangladesh. Seasonal relative humidity exhibits a significant upward trend only in the Northwest (D) with 25% of the total wheat growing area of Bangladesh. Overall then, widespread variations in climate patterns during the wheat growing season exist across regions.  5.2 Data stationarity The unit root test exploits both time series and cross-sectional time series (i.e. panel data) dimensions of the data. The Fisher-type augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test and subsequently the Harris-Tzavalis (HT) to test for robustness have been widely used to examine stationarity. Test statistics (a detailed version is not provided here for brevity) from both tests reject the null hypothesis of all panels containing unit roots implying non-stationarity (p  < 0.01). These results are consistent with McCarl et al. (2008) ; Kim and Pang (2009) , and Sarker et al. (2014) . Therefore, no co-integration causality tests are executed before using the three-stage feasible generalized least squares method.  5.3 Results from the regression model The estimated results presented in Table 4   suggest that the model is satisfactory given an R 2  of 0.62 and a Wald χ2  (78.97, p  < 0.01). Four climate variables significantly affect wheat yield. They decrease with the increase in average temperature (p  < 0.01) and vary directly with rainfall during both planting (p  < 0.05) and flowering (p  < 0.05) stages of the production cycle. Rainfall during the planting phase had a stronger positive effect on wheat yield than rainfall in the flowering phase. On the other hand, an increase in the number of dry days resulted in a decline in wheat yield (p  < 0.01). Other climatic variables such as Seasonal temperature range, harvesting rainfall, bright sunshine and Seasonal relative humidity did not have any significant effect on wheat yield. Wheat yield shows a significant positive trend over time. The two time dummies (1981–2006) and (2007–2016) clearly demonstrated that wheat yields grew at a significantly higher rate relative to the period 1972–1980 (Phase 1). The coefficients of the two dummy variables (0.03 for 1981–2007 and 0.16 for 2007–2016) measure the instantaneous (at a point of time) growth rates, not compound growth rates over a period of time.2  2 Following Gujarati (2003, p.180)  compound growth rates can be found as [exp (coefficient) -1] x100.   The resulting annual compound growth rates for the 1981–2006 and 2007–2016 periods came to 3.05% and 17.35% respectively. Importantly, the spectacular yield growth during the last decade of the time series can be linked to technological breakthroughs in wheat research. Wheat yield varied across climatic regions. In the South-west it was significantly lower (F, p  < 0.01) than that of the Mid-south (G) region while those in Northern parts of north (C, p  < 0.01) and West (E, p  < 0.01) were significantly higher. There does not appear to be any significant difference in yields between North-west (D) and Mid-south (F, p  < 0.14). Additionally, the South-west (F) region had significantly different yields than those of the remaining regions, after accounting for climate variability. This could be due to persistent differences in agro-ecological conditions or management practices.  5.4 Climate elasticities of wheat yield To measure the relative yield response to changes in statistically significant climatic variables we transform the coefficients of the climate parameters into elasticities by multiplying them by the corresponding averages and dividing by the average wheat yield (Chen et al., 2004 ; Sarker et al., 2013 , 2014 ). Table 5   reports these elasticities. A rise in the number of seasonal dry days and average seasonal temperature were the two variables that most adversely affected wheat yield. A 1% increase in both seasonal dry days and average temperature resulted in wheat yield declines of 0.92% and 0.82%, respectively. On the other hand, both planting and flowering rainfall had ameliorating effects on wheat yield. A 1% increase in each of these variables resulted in likely yield increases of 0.43% and 0.29%, respectively.   6 Expanding area under wheat cultivation: implications for food security (SDG 2) and sustainable water management (SDG 6) In light of the preceding discussion, this section explores the potential for expanding the area under wheat cultivation and its implications for food security and sustainable water management. 6.1 Potential for expanding the area under wheat cultivation As stated earlier, the area under wheat cultivation in Bangladesh hovers about the half a million ha mark. On the other hand, land area suitable for wheat cultivation is estimated at 4.842 m ha of which 1.328 m ha is classified as very suitable (VS) and 3.514 m ha as suitable (S) (Hussain et al., 2012, p.43 ). If the estimated 1.350 m ha of moderately suitable categories of land for wheat cultivation is included, the existing wheat area of about 0.5 m ha barely exceeds 10% of the suitable land area. This indicates a significant potential for expanding the area under wheat cultivation. The principal cereal crop that competes with wheat is irrigated boro  rice. Fig. 4   juxtaposes land suitability maps for the two crops (boro  rice in left-hand panel, wheat in right-hand panel). A closer inspection of the two maps and comparison with the climate zone map presented in Fig. 4  clearly suggests that boro  rice cultivation has been extended to areas which are at best moderately or marginally suitable or not suitable at all for boro  rice cultivation in all of climatic Zone C, and significant parts of climatic zones D and E. On the other hand, the bulk of climatic zones C, D and E are endowed with land either very suitable or suitable (zones C and D) or at the worst moderately suitable (Zone E) for wheat cultivation. However, different climate zones have different land suitability/concentration of wheat production (Appendix Table A1 ). For example, climate zones C and D possess very suitable and suitable areas of wheat production. Climate zones E comprises moderately suitable area of wheat production. While zones G and F have a combination of very suitable, suitable, moderately and marginally suitable areas for wheat cultivation, climate zones A and B are largely unsuitable for wheat production aside from a few isolated pockets. This clearly demonstrates the lack of correspondence between cropping pattern and land suitability (Sabiha et al., 2016 ). Thus, the overwhelming boro  rice intensity in the dry season cropping patterns in zones C, D and E is consistent neither with resource endowments (e.g., water availability) nor ecological conditions (land suitability). Switching from boro  rice to wheat at least partially in these areas is likely to ameliorate the existing incongruity between crop suitability and cropping pattern.  6.2 Implications for food security and sustainable water management Exploring the implications of switching from boro  rice to wheat for Bangladesh’s food security and sustainable water management pivots around the key question as to whether wheat area expansion can contribute to sustainable water management without compromising food security. As of 2016, the boro  rice (unhusked) yield in Bangladesh was 3.9 t ha−1  while the wheat yield was 3.1 t ha−1 . Given this yield difference, switching 1 m ha of land from rice to wheat could decrease overall grain production by 800 thousand MT. However, recent developments in wheat research suggest that the yield gap between wheat and boro  rice could be significantly narrowed. The Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI)3  3 Most recently, Bangladesh government has upgraded the WRC to Bangladesh Wheat and Maize Research Institute (BWMRI).   has developed nine wheat varieties since 2010 [BARI Gom -25 and BARI Gom -26 (released 2010); BARI Gom -27 and BARI Gom -28 (released 2012); BARI Gom -29 and BARI Gom -30 (released 2014); and BARI Gom -31 (released 2017); BARI Gom -32 and BARI Gom -33 (released 2017)]. All these varieties, especially those released since 2014, are not only high yielding but also tolerant to terminal heat stress and resistant to stem rust diseases. Once widespread adoption and diffusion takes place, it is estimated that the yield gap between boro  rice and wheat and the resulting shortfall in overall grain production will be minimal. A positive outcome of expanding the area under wheat is that it is likely to be more environment-compatible given that wheat cultivation is less water-intensive than boro  rice (Sharma et al., 2018 ). Employing 31-year time series (1985–2015) data, Kamruzzaman and Sarker (2017, p.6)  reported that in the greater Rajshahi district (Climate Zone E), boro  rice and wheat respectively required 423.6 cm and 164.9 cm of water at the average temperature. On the other hand, the water requirement for wheat is less than 40% for boro  rice. It is well known that boro  rice production is almost completely dependent on groundwater irrigation (see e.g., Alauddin and Sharma, 2013 ). Increased use of groundwater in the absence of full recharge of aquifers has led to depletion of groundwater tables (Shamsuddoha et al., 2011). Alauddin and Sharma (2013, p.217)  using district-level panel data for four decades found that ten districts accounting for about half of Bangladesh’s net cropped area, revealed a two-way causation between groundwater depth and percentage of total area under irrigation from groundwater sources. While Bangladesh's water scarcity is primarily economic in nature, some northwest Bangladesh districts, such as Chapai Nawabganj, Naogaon, and Rajshahi (Climate Zone E) may be approaching physical water scarcity, due to a lack of sufficient water to meet all demands, including environmental flows (Alauddin and Sharma, 2013 ). Furthermore, on a scale of 0 to 1, Bangladesh's water security threat has reached an extreme level (in the 0.8–1.0 range, World Bank, 2013, p. 119 ). This makes the existing practices of high dependence on groundwater unsustainable. Relaxation of pressure on groundwater resources could, therefore, deliver a major saving of environmental capital. That is, expanding the area under wheat replacing boro  rice provides an avenue for sustainable water management without compromising food security. A signficant change in Bangladesh’s climatic trends typified by rising average temperature, and number of seasonal dry days have been observed over time. Rainfall during planting and flowering stages of the produciton cycle of wheat has registered a significant downward trend. Results from the regression model indicate signficant adverse effects of rising seasonal average temperature, Seasonal relative humidity and number of seasonal dry days on wheat yields. The study equally found increased rainfall at planting and flowering stages conducive to wheat yields. Climate change is shown to affect wheat yields in different climate zones differently. Furthermore, positve time trends in yields indicate technological breakthoughs which can mitigate some of these climate stresses on wheat yield. Incompatibility between cropping patterns and land suitability was clearly evident. Boro  rice cultivation takes place on land not suitable for it, but is suitable for wheat cultivation. Extending the area under wheat cultivation by replacing boro  rice therefore offers the opportunnity to save substantial enviornmental capital given that wheat cultivation requires far less (ground) water than boro  rice. Overall, then, expanding the area under wheat cultivation can meet the twin goals of SDG2 and SDG6.   7 Policy implications The findings of this paper have several policy implications centring on the capacity to ensure food security which is compatible with sustainable water management. This is in the face of the on-the-ground realities of a dwindling supply of arable land per capita, unsustainable usage of groundwater resources, and significant manifestations of climate related phenomena including frequent outbreaks of severe droughts and its adverse effect on crop yields and production. The policy implications relate primarily to scientific breakthroughs, the provision of stronger institutional support services for farmers, easier access to relevant information and wider access to community-based farming education to facilitate more effective agronomic and crop culture practices to realise potential crop yields. Given the complex nature of drought as a phenomenon, further development of drought-tolerant and short maturing varieties are of critical importance. Two key areas for policy intervention appear to be appropriate in order to maintain food security compatible with sustainable water management. These relate to R & D-based and institutional support-based policy options. The remainder of this section provides further details in regard to the specific focus underlying these policy areas.  R & D-based option It is clearly of critical importance for Bangladesh to develop crop water-saving varieties. These include wheat as well as non-wheat crops. To date Bangladesh agriculture has been characterised by a virtual rice mono-culture with overwhelming reliance on ground-water irrigation during the dry season. The wheat varieties dveloped in the last two decades especially since 2010 are high yielding, tolerant to terminal heat stress and resistant to stem rust diseases as well. However, a recent study (Mottaleb et al., 2019 ) suggests that in February 2016, the emergence of wheat blast (a deadly fungal disease) affected 15,000 (about 3.5% of total wheat area in Bangaldesh) in climatic zones F and G. The yield losses resulting from this outbreak ranged from 5 to 51% (Cf. BSS, 2018 ) in affected areas. In the following year the outbreak of the disease was reported in parts of Zone C and G implying that the deadly blast might be an established diesease with no apparent propsect for eradication (Mottaleb et al., 2019 ). The elevation of the Wheat Research Centre to the Bangladesh Wheat and Maize Research Institute provides it with a stronger mandate to forge external linkages with the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT). It is encouraging to note that through the use of a breeding line from CIMMYT, Bangladesh has developed and released a bio-fortified variety of wheat, BARI Gom -33 in 2017 which is resilient to wheat blast disease. It is currently in field trials in Bangladesh and Bolivia although it is too early to obain a more definite picture about its true potential (BARI, 2017 ). A key constraint to realise the full yield potential of wheat is delay in sowing and, therefore, missing the optimum sowing period which runs from the second week of November to the first week of December. This is due, among other things, to late harvesting of aman  rice, longer time for land preparation, late monsoons and excess soil moisture (Hussain et al., 2012 , p.43). Avoiding delays in sowing wheat warrants intensifying research on the development of aman  rice varieties of shorter duration (BRRI, 2018 ). The WRC developed many varieties but detailed adoption information is not well documented despite the imperative for access to such data by agricultural scientists and policy makers. Among the varieties, thirteen have been adopted by farmers since 2000. BARI Gom  24 (Prodip ) accounts for the largest cultivated area (41.03% of the total area under wheat cultivation) due to its attractive characteristics including high yield, big spike, large grain, and lodging tolerance. This is followed by BARI Gom  21 (Shatabdi ), BARI Gom  26 and BARI Gom 23 (Bijoy ) with respective percentage shares of 24.97%, 11.43% and 11.06% (Rashid and Hossain, 2016, p. 499 ). However, BARI Gom  30, 31, 32 and 33 (all released since 2014) are likely to be widely adopted given their heat stress, salinity and lodging-compatible attributes as well as being short maturing. Of paramount importance is to extend and intensify research efforts toward developing HYVs of non-cereal crops e.g., pulses and vegetables which are financially attractive to farmers and can partially but effectively replace the rabi  rice crop. These crop varieties must contain multiple attributes involving wider adaptability to temperature variations, higher yields and lower levels of water usage.  Institutional support Assisting farmers to put in place successful strategies to offset the adverse effects of climate change warrants significantly stronger support services such as easier access for farmers to relevant information and improved extension services. The challenge is to use the ICT-literate young people as change agents to disseminate knowledge to the farming community in order to manage drought and other climate related adversities. Local level ICT centres at 4500 unions throughout Bangladesh provide a strong platform for the use of such technologies. There also needs to be significant strengthening of the linkages involving education extension and research. This is critically important for awareness building and sensitization of resource use and resource conservation. The overwhelming dietary dependency on rice needs a rethink. However, this can only be addressed over the long-term given that food habits are inherent in the socio-cultural environment. Reduction in dietary dependency on rice and increased dependence on pulses for example, could deliver significant water-savings and at the same time be more nutritious for consumers. This could be achieved through an awareness building program which encourages dietary change and which can be expanded through integration into the national education curriculum. This may require intervention at the ministerial level. However, this is beyond the scope of this study and warrants further research. Bangladesh has made significant progress on food security particularly in terms of main staple food rice at least at the national level. Currently, Bangladesh does not import rice at government level rather it exported 25 thousand MT coarse rice to Sri Lanka in the 2014–2015 (GoB, 2016 ). However, during the same period, wheat import at the public sector level was 0.416 million MT (GoB, 2016 ). Bulk of wheat import takes place via the private sector channels. Both governmental and non-governmental organizations can play a significant role in demonstrating and disseminating new wheat varieties among farmers. More rapid use of newly developed high-yielding wheat varities that are temperature and drought-compatible along with better crop management technologies will increase wheat productivity, reduce the country’s import dependence and ensure food security. The use of chemicals and fertilizers to control pest management is on the increase for wheat cultivation in Bangladesh (GoB, 2017 ). Large scale use of chemicals and fertilizer is costly and potentially harmful for human and environmental health. So, protecting wheat with inherent pest resistance is a smart alternative. There is, therefore, pressure for genetically complex new wheat varities combining several genes to withstand new mutation of the pathogen to be rapidly released. Furthermore, scientists need to develop less water dependent wheat varieties to eliminate the unfavourable effect of declining rainfall trend over the years.4  4 A typical wheat crop needs to be irrigated 1-2 times in the absence of rain.   In the case of the erratic shifting seasonal period for rain-fed wheat, adding to small-scale supplementary water irrigation can greatly increase the production of farmers who traditionally rely on rainfed cultivation. Given that many parts of Bangladesh face severe groundwater depletion (Alauddin and Sarker, 2014 ; Mustafa et al., 2017 ), switching to surface water irrigation practices clearly presents itself as a better choice for sustainable growth of wheat cultivation. Deficit irrigation strategies suggested by Mustafa et al. (2017)  could be another water-saving option. In Bangladesh, groundwater extraction has produced high energy costs and health risks due to arsenic contamination in contrast to surface water which requires lower energy and produces lower carbon emissions (Santos valle et al., 2014 ). Axial flow pumps (AFPs) can be used to ehance water use efficiency. Although Bangladesh introduced AFPs in 2013 (Santos valle et al., 2014 ), their use has yet to be widespread among local farmers. Thus, organizing comprehensive training programmes for poor native farmers can greatly assist in the adopion of this technology. In addition, agro-forestry and soil conservation measures can be helpful to mitigate the effects of climate change. Equally important is facilitation of region-specific research to account for regional differences and which can deliver appropriate local or micro-level adaptation (Kabir et al., 2017 ) strategies/policies for confronting geographically uneven climate impacts. Finally, these policy recommendations if practised effectively in a well coordinated way, can make an important contribution to meeting Bangladesh’s food security and achieving SDG2 and SDG6.  8 Conclusions Employing 45-year panel data for the five major wheat growing regions of Bangladesh, this study investigates trends in key climatic variables and their effects on wheat yield, the second most important cereal staple. It also explores the scope for expanding the area under wheat cultivation into suitable areas currently occupied by boro  rice and its implications for food security (SDG2) and sustainable water management (SDG6).
