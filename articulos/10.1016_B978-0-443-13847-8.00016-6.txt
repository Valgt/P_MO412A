               Approximately 99% of the primary resources used in producing plastic are derived from nonrenewable fossil fuels. This represents a significant percentage of global oil and gas usage, varying between 8% and 9%. The widespread use of plastic items in our daily lives can be attributed to their cost-effectiveness, lightweight composition, adaptability, and ease of use. Most plastic waste is commonly managed through methods such as incineration, landfill deposition, or environmental discharge, which can pose a substantial risk to both human health and ecological systems. The transformation of plastic waste into alternative energy sources, such as fuel, is a viable strategy for advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) delineated in the 2030 Agenda. This approach has demonstrated efficacy in mitigating the buildup of plastic waste in the natural environment. This chapter offers a comprehensive assessment of plastic waste’s impact on the environment and human health. Additionally, it examines the conversion of plastic waste into fuel, considering the SDGs. This chapter also scrutinizes the obstacles and prospects associated with this approach.

Keywords Sustainable development  sustainability engineering  waste  environmental chemical engineering  water management  energy sustainability  environmental science  energy resource  life cycle assessment  environmental impact   16.1 Introduction  The widespread utilization of plastics is attributed to their high demand in diverse applications, including but not limited to agriculture, residential settings, the automotive industry, packaging, toys, and electronics, among others (Qualhato et al., 2023 ). As per the findings of Callister and Rethwisch (2018) , plastic is a polymeric material mainly composed of extended carbon chains. Plastics are enriched with additives that augment their structural stability and manifest long-lasting chemical bonds that may take several centuries to decompose. Plastic products have been crucial in meeting societal needs in diverse economic sectors worldwide. Since 1990, there has been a steady yearly increase of 5% in plastic demand. Consequently, there has been a commensurate rise in plastic waste produced. Panda et al. (2010)  have identified that municipalities and industries produce two distinct categories of plastic waste. The employment of industrial plastics to downcycle into plastic products of lower grade is considered beneficial owing to their intrinsic consistency and comparatively minimal impurities. The presence of additional constituents in municipal plastic results in more significant heterogeneity. Zhou et al. (2014)  reported that plastic waste constitutes roughly 10% of municipal solid waste. The development of plastic has progressed in parallel with the advancement of human society. Plastic has been instrumental in facilitating numerous technological advancements. The utilization of various plastic materials has resulted in notable improvements in the  functionality, ease of use, and safety of everyday activities, leading to significant transformations. As per Callister and Rethwisch (2018) ’s findings, several notable attributes of these materials encompass their cost-effectiveness, reduced mass, adaptability, robustness, user-friendliness, and production feasibility. The increasing environmental apprehensions regarding plastic pollution and insufficient plastic waste management call for public attention and resolution. A significant disparity between the rate at which societal habits transform and the enduring nature of plastics was observed. As a result, the benefits of using plastic materials in diverse contexts and shifts in human behavior have resulted in significant predicaments, such as a rise in the waste buildup. Governments across the globe have instituted public policies aimed at addressing the problem of plastic waste, with differing degrees of engagement from stakeholders. The aforementioned policies encompass measures aimed at educating the populace on the proper utilization and disposal of plastic materials. Inadequate waste management can lead to socioenvironmental concerns that jeopardize the well-being of the general population. The notion of sustainable development aims to meet the current economic and developmental requirements of the present generation while ensuring the environmental well-being of future generations. The United Nations has instituted the SDGs to preserve natural resources and foster a sustainable future. The SDGs have gained global recognition due to their emphasis on environmental deterioration, sustainability, climate change, and water security concerns. The concomitant progress of both society and technology is crucial to attaining economic expansion while upholding ecological sustainability. The tripartite sustainability framework comprises three fundamental constituents: the natural environment, the economic system, and human development. The achievement of sustainable development requires the satisfaction of all three prerequisites. Utilization of plastic-based products has significantly contributed to the improvement of the quality of human existence and has facilitated the emergence of numerous essential aspects of our civilization. The plastics industry has made significant contributions to sustainable development worldwide and is anticipated to play a crucial role in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Due to the pervasive daily use of plastics, the plastics industry and its products have a significant relationship with the SDGs. The plastics industry has made significant contributions to numerous disciplines, including renewable energy, global sanitation, healthcare services, and the creation of employment opportunities in the waste management and recycling sectors. Although the plastics business has a considerable positive impact on daily living, the general public frequently disregards it. In recent times, there has been a noticeable and increasing reluctance toward the issue of plastic pollution. Ng et al. (2018)  have observed that the deposition of plastics in landfills results from inadequate waste management, overproduction, and inadequate knowledge of recycling practices. Plastic  waste management in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems presents a considerable challenge for expanding populations, particularly in developing nations. The proposition of employing plastic waste for electricity production is advocated instead of landfills, owing to the potential for environmental seepage. According to the research of Cristina Fossi et al. (2020) , the incineration of plastic waste results in large emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other atmospheric pollutants. Shen et al. (2020)  anticipate that plastics will be responsible for 1.34 gigatonnes of yearly GHGs emission by 2030 and 2.80 gigatonnes by 2050. The discharge of GHGs and other atmospheric contaminants is inconsistent with the aims delineated in SDGs 13 and 15, which are concerned with mitigating climate change and conserving terrestrial ecosystems, respectively. The pyrolysis technique for chemically recycling plastic waste into eco-friendly commodities, such as fuel, has gained considerable traction. Miandad et al. (2016)  have described the pyrolysis process, wherein the polymers present in waste plastic undergo thermal degradation without oxygen, forming monomers. Dogu et al. (2021)  have reported that using pyrolysis as a waste-to-energy conversion technique can significantly reduce the emission of GHGs and other detrimental pollutants compared with incineration. This analysis aims to examine the association between the transformation of plastic waste into fuel and its influence on the pertinent SDGs. This study analyzes the current state of plastic pollution and the management of plastic waste, as well as examines the challenges and opportunities linked to these matters.  16.2 Plastic waste-to-fuel The global demand for plastics has experienced a notable upswing in recent years, primarily attributed to the expansion of industry, agriculture, and fisheries. As a result, there has been a consistent increase in plastic waste generated each year. As per the United Nations Environment Programme report, worldwide plastic waste is estimated to have surpassed 360 million metric tonnes. Plastic is a polymeric material characterized by a substantial molecular weight and a structurally stable composition. However, its environmental implications are significant due to its resistance to biodegradation by microorganisms. The fuel conversion technique is a feasible approach for effectively managing plastic waste. Furthermore, this methodology generates sustainable, renewable energy. Passamonti and Sedran (2012)  have outlined various techniques, including hydrocracking, thermochemical, and catalytic conversion, for modifying the chemical bond-cracking process involved in fuel production. Pyrolysis, a widely used technique, refers to the thermochemical conversion process. According to Ding et al. (1997) , the presence of hydrogen and high temperatures facilitate the hydrocracking process, which involves the conversion of more significant hydrocarbons, particularly polymers, into fuel-grade hydrocarbons. Scott et al. (1990)  conducted an investigation centered on polyethylene’s hydrocracking. The process  was carried out at 600°C within an activated carbon bed. The investigators observed that the technique resulted in a twofold increase in the amount of C5 gas fractions compared with thermal cracking executed in an unreactive milieu and that the procedure was free of char generation. In contrast, the primary resulting compounds comprised gaseous hydrocarbons within the C5 range. Sharma et al. (2014)  have reported that hydrocarbons within the boiling point range of 35°C−185°C can be used for the production of motor gasoline, whereas hydrocarbons with a boiling point between 185°C and 290°C can yield diesel #1 and diesel #2. Furthermore, gasoline production involves the extraction of hydrocarbons with a boiling range between 350°C and 538°C. In comparison, the recovery of residual gasoline is achieved through the distillation of hydrocarbons with a boiling point exceeding 538°C. Syamsiro et al. (2014)  have reported that selecting a suitable heat treatment/degradation temperature, plastic type, degradation period, and catalyst type can produce varying proportions. In addition, the incorporation of a catalyst in the hydrocracking process, specifically silica-alumina, alumina, and zeolites, has the potential to increase conversion efficiencies, improve fuel quality, increase selectivity, and reduce both the temperature and duration of pyrolysis, all through catalytic mechanisms. According to Panda et al. (2010) , transition metals such as platinum, iron, nickel, and molybdenum have been integrated into these compounds. Buekens and Huang (1998)  suggest that the conversion rate can be improved by creating on-chain carbonium ions through the protonation of faulty polymer sites. This approach utilizes the acidic characteristics of catalysts that are frequently used. The acidity level of the catalyst impacts selectivity and fuel quality. The application of acid catalysts has led to augmented conversion efficiencies, particularly in the presence of meso- and microporous substances. As per the findings of Miskolczi et al. (2009) , the initial cracking takes place on the surface of macropores, which is then followed by the promotion of further cracking through micropores subsequent to the fracturing of the polymer. Implementing a highly effective catalyst generates hydrocarbons with lower molecular weights, specifically within the C3–C5 range. According to the findings of Aguado et al. (2008) , a polymer-to-catalyst ratio of 10:1 enables full conversion in 1 hour of contact time. Implementing alternative fuels such as plastic oil, diesel, and petrol has facilitated the utilization of this methodology, as noted by Fadillah et al. (2021) . The process of polymer degradation is initiated through the application of thermal energy, transforming plastic waste into liquid oil and combustible gas. The traditional pyrolysis technique has been used to convert plastic waste into a fuel consisting of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, characterized by a carbon range spanning from C5 to C20. The production of flammable gases, specifically carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and methane, was documented by Panda et al. (2010) . The utilization of gases and fuel obtained directly from plastic waste can function as secondary energy sources, improving energy conversion efficiency.  In their work, Chanashetty and Patil (2015)  used a condenser and a reactor to produce a variety of fuels, including diesel, kerosene, and lubricating oil, from plastic waste, including sheet plastic, stiff film, and expanded foam. Karad and Havalammanavar (2017)  exploited pyrolysis at temperatures between 350°C and 500°C to convert diverse plastic waste materials, including food wrap, plastic bags, and oil bottles, into high-value products such as diesel, gasoline, and kerosene. Mathur et al. (2016)  utilized pyrolysis with plastic waste as the major feedstock. As outputs, waste oil and diesel fuel were created. According to the results of the experiment, 1.5 kg of plastic generated 1.65 liters of oil. A study was conducted by Mustofa Kamal and Zainuri (2015)  to investigate the production of liquid fuel from plastic waste through the process of pyrolysis, which was carried out at a temperature of 900°C. The study’s results indicate that the procedure yielded a liquid fuel and effectively decomposed diverse plastic materials, including but not limited to demolish plastic, drain bottles, cleanser parcels, and water funnel containers, in an ecologically sound manner. The study’s findings indicate that the reduction of boric acid and cyclopentanone occurred at a pyrolysis temperature of 900°C. Consequently, the fuel acquired a more excellent calorific value than the one obtained at a temperature of 425°C. Miteva et al. (2016)  conducted a study that examined the thermal pyrolysis of solid waste plastic. The study used a semibath reactor composed of stainless steel, a condenser, and a catalyst. The scholars additionally investigated the process of catalytic pyrolysis as a means of converting plastic waste. The plastic material underwent a chemical transformation process, producing liquid fuel. The yield of the final liquid product ranged from 77% to 88%, a significant amount. On the other hand, current thermal techniques involve the processes of catalytic cracking and hydrothermal liquefaction. As per the research conducted by Shen et al. (2020) , plastic waste underwent a conversion process resulting in the generation of gaseous hydrocarbons and >C13 nonaromatic liquid fuel when subjected to temperatures within the range of 250°C−450°C. Furthermore, according to Weber and Ramasamy (2020) , the degradation of plastic polymers in oxidation systems rich in OH species leads to the production of H2 . The chemical industry can effectively use plastic waste as a valuable carbon resource to produce organic compounds, including carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. Moreover, it is feasible to transform the carbon dioxide generated during the advanced oxidation process into acetic acid using photoreduction or electrocatalysis. The results suggest that the thermal catalytic methodology is viable for converting discarded plastic materials into usable fuel. The utilization of thermal cracking and pyrolysis techniques, combined with the use of aluminum silicates as catalysts for converting waste plastic into fuel, represents a more helpful strategy when compared with the traditional landfill approach. The plastic materials in this procedure comprise polypropylene, polyethylene, and polystyrene, which are converted into plastic oil and diesel fuel.   16.3 Plastic waste and related sustainable development goals The sustainable development goals are an all-encompassing framework that promotes a sustainable and equitable future for all members of society. On September 25, 2015, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly endorsed “Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” as a continuation of the previously attained Millennium Development Goals (United Nation, 2015 ). As noted previously, the set contains 17 SDGs, each with 169 related targets. The sustainable development goals (SDGs) were implemented on January 1, 2016, and are a comprehensive set of global objectives that strive to combine several aspects of development, including social, economic, and environmental factors. The SDGs demonstrate the principles of indivisibility, interconnectedness, and universality, as they encompass nations at varying levels of development, including developed, developing, and least developed nations. Therefore it is essential to implement inclusive and collaborative approaches to guarantee that no individual or group is marginalized from the scope of the SDGs. The principal responsibility of nations is to oversee and assess the implementation of objectives and standards at the national level up to the year 2030. According to Dilekli and Cazcarro (2019) ; Walker (2021) ; and Kumar et al. (2022) , the primary objectives of the SDGs are to safeguard the environment, eradicate poverty, and meet the needs of both present and future generations. The present investigation emphasizes current scholarly inquiry and comprehensively analyzes the fundamental issues of converting plastic waste into fuel. The aim is to reduce the buildup of plastic waste in the surroundings and to achieve the SDGs established by the United Nations. Accessibility, affordability, and purity of energy sources are critical determinants of the quality of life. It is imperative to properly dispose of, repurpose, and convert the significant volume of plastic waste generated annually. Given the nondegradable properties of plastic, the most feasible and eco-friendly strategy for tackling plastic waste is its reutilization for alternative purposes. The environmentally significant matter of producing fuels and other valuable commodities through the conscientious management of plastic waste is paramount. The implications of this extend beyond the energy sector, encompassing material retrieval and applications in the industrial sector. According to Awogbemi and Kallon (2023) , implementing innovative technologies and methodologies to tackle various environmental issues and plastic waste has resulted in economic benefits, as evidenced in the scholarly literature. Additionally, converting waste plastic into fuel can generate cost-efficient and eco-friendly energy for various applications, thereby advancing sustainable development (Awogbemi & Kallon, 2023 ). The forthcoming sections of this manuscript will scrutinize the procedure of transforming plastic waste into fuel and its congruence with the SDGs. 16.3.1 SDG 3: Good health and well-being The SDG 3 focuses on promoting well-being and improving health. By converting plastic waste to fuel, the accumulation of plastic waste deposited in landfills or in the  environment can be reduced. As Walker et al. (2022)  posited, the potential outcome of this approach could be an enhancement in air and water quality, which could have positive implications for human health. This is due to reduced exposure to plastic and microplastics, which could promote overall well-being across all life stages. Furthermore, the application of fuel from plastic waste can reduce reliance on nonsustainable energy resources, thus aiding in the amelioration of atmospheric conditions and augmenting public health. In recent years, plastic exposure has been linked to type 2 diabetes, cancer, obesity, thyroid abnormalities, neurodevelopmental delays, and inflammatory bowel disease, among other long-term health difficulties (Li et al., 2021; Sari et al., 2022 ). It has been discovered that human biological material, including placental tissue, contains microplastics. According to recent studies conducted by Walker (2021) and Naah Angnunavuri et al. (2023) , the existence of microplastics in food packaging, food, and atmospheric particles has the potential to expose humans to health risks through multiple pathways, including ingestion, inhalation, and skin contact. Consuming microplastics can lead to their assimilation by diverse bodily organs, thereby causing deleterious consequences for human well-being, such as cellular harm and the instigation of inflammatory and immunological reactions. However, there are significant gaps in our comprehension of the effects of plastics on human health. As per Walker (2021) ’s observation, unresolved challenges exist in implementing the SDGs that guarantee sound health and well-being for all age groups. The process of converting plastic waste into fuel is subject to certain limitations. Plastic waste incineration has the potential to emit toxic substances into the surrounding air and water, posing a threat to human health and safety. Using plastic waste as a fuel source could also perpetuate our reliance on nonrenewable energy sources and impede the development of sustainable energy alternatives. This may result in unfavorable outcomes for both the environment and human health in the future. Using plastic waste as a fuel source has the potential to contribute to the attainment of SDG 3 significantly. This is due to its ability to reduce plastic pollution and encourage the adoption of sustainable energy practices. Nevertheless, it is essential to assess the potential downsides of its use and to ensure that its implementation is consistent with broader initiatives to promote sustainable development and human well-being.  16.3.2 SDG 6: Clean water and sanitation Naah Angnunavuri et al. (2023)  have reported that a considerable segment of rural populations still depends on freshwater resources, such as groundwater wells, rivers, and streams, to meet their drinking water requirements. The delivery of uncontaminated and secure potable water is a fundamental human right. The global community faces many water-related challenges, disproportionately affecting communities in low-income  countries with limited financial resources to invest in advanced technologies to enhance water sources; Sufiani et al. (2023) and Dilekli and Cazcarro (2019)  reported that in 2008, around 900 million individuals were devoid of access to uncontaminated water, while in 2015, approximately 2.4 billion individuals were deprived of appropriate sanitary facilities. The United Nations has established an objective for SDG 6 to attain global availability of hygienic water, sanitation, and hygiene by 2030, intending to guarantee the equitable allocation of these resources among all individuals (United Nation, 2015 ). As highlighted by Naah Angnunavuri et al. (2023) , prioritizing water safety management is crucial in protecting the public’s health and promoting the welfare of individuals. According to Sari et al. (2022) , the accumulation of plastic waste has substantial effects on a variety of industries, including tourism, the maritime industry, marine ecosystems, and human health. Although there have been several documented approximations, the amount of plastic waste in the ecosystem has yet to be ascertained. As per the findings of Sari et al. (2022) , Indonesia generated the second-highest volume of marine plastic waste, which ranged from 0.48 to 1.29 Mt in 2010. Furthermore, it was reported that in 2016, the coastal communities in Indonesia generated a significant quantity of plastic waste that was inadequately managed, resulting in a global total of 4.28 million metric tonnes. As per the findings of Naah Angnunavuri et al. (2023) , plastic materials possess the capacity to endure in the ecosystem for prolonged durations. Nevertheless, these entities demonstrate instability and are prone to degradation, fragmentation, dimension reduction, depolymerization, and demineralization. Plastic materials are susceptible to degradation caused by various factors such as chemical, microbiological, mechanical, and UV radiation−induced mechanisms, which can ultimately compromise their structural integrity. Naah Angnunavuri et al. (2023)  have demonstrated that the fragmentation of plastic waste into particles of different sizes, ranging from macro to nano, has significant implications for the hydrogeochemistry and microbiology of aquatic ecosystems. Microplastics, nanoplastics, and subnanoplastics refer to plastic particles of different sizes. Naah Angnunavuri et al. (2023)  have posited that consuming particulate plastics in contact with water may lead to unfavorable health outcomes. The efficacy of water treatment facilities in eliminating particle plastics from natural water systems is impeded by technological constraints, leading to a suboptimal removal rate. The presence and potential hazards of microplastics in tap and bottled drinking water were brought to the attention of the World Health Organization (WHO). The levels of particulate plastics in drinking water obtained from treatment facilities display considerable variability, ranging from imperceptible to surpassing 900 particles per liter. The observed variability can be primarily attributed to factors such as the water source, the treatment plant’s design, and the analytical methods utilized. The correlation between particulate plastics in bottled drinking water and the plastic packaging material and frequent usage has been established. For instance, repeated use of plastic bottles results in a twofold  increase in particles discharged into the environment. Although wastewater treatment facilities exhibit clearance rates ranging from 90% to 99%, they are still considered point sources that discharge microplastics into the environment (Walker, 2021 ). The attainment of SDG 6, which endeavors to guarantee the worldwide availability of and enduring management of water and sanitation, may be expedited by using plastic waste as a fuel source. The process of transforming plastic waste into fuel possesses the capacity to alleviate the buildup of plastic waste in aquatic ecosystems, including rivers and oceans. This, in turn, can lead to positive consequences for the quality and availability of water. Implementing these can benefit the welfare of individuals by reducing exposure to pollutants and improving access to untainted water resources. Furthermore, recycling plastic waste into fuel has the potential to generate cash for water and sanitation infrastructure projects in deprived areas. This could contribute to the advancement of sustainable water resource management and the improvement of access to sanitary facilities. The conversion of plastic waste into fuel can negatively impact SDG 6 if implemented in an unsustainable manner. The conversion of plastic waste into fuel exacerbates water scarcity issues in regions already experiencing water stress due to the significant water consumption involved. In addition, converting plastic waste into fuel can release harmful substances into the aquatic environment, negatively impacting human health and the ecosystem if not adequately controlled. The phenomenon aforementioned could exacerbate the problem of restricted availability of potable water and pollution, thereby hindering the realization of SDG 6. Therefore converting plastic waste into fuel can help achieve SDG 6 by reducing plastic pollution and providing funds for water and sanitation services. It is crucial to assess the possible outcomes thoroughly and guarantee that the process is carried out sustainably and conscientiously.  16.3.3 SDG 11: Sustainable cities and communities SDG 11, which concerns sustainable cities and communities, was instituted by the United Nations General Assembly. With the exponential growth of the global population, urban developers and cities face the challenge of ensuring sustainability. Based on recent statistics, around 55% of the world’s population currently inhabits urban regions. As per the projections of The World Bank (2022) , the urban population is expected to reach 6 billion by 2045. The rapid rate of progress has resulted in a multitude of prospects, yet has also instigated substantial unease within society, the economy, and the ecosystem. The rapid process of urbanization presents a range of challenges, including but not limited to the provision of affordable housing, the establishment of efficient infrastructure, the mitigation of pollution, and the assurance of resident safety (Palanivel, 2017 ). The challenges aforementioned require urban communities to address and alleviate them worldwide.  The notion of sustainable urban areas entails giving precedence to optimizing energy consumption, preserving natural resources, and mitigating waste generation. This objective is met through exploiting renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, or by increasing the efficiency of current resources, such as water and electricity (Owusu & Asumadu-Sarkodie, 2016 ). One indicator of a sustainable urban environment is initiatives to convert plastic waste into renewable energy sources. A team of scholars at the University of Cambridge has devised a mechanism to harness sustainable energy to transform refuse into chemical commodities (Bhattacharjee et al., 2023 ). The equipment, as mentioned earlier, can concurrently transform two discrete classifications of waste, specifically greenhouse gases and plastic, into two sustainable and environmentally friendly energy sources, namely glycolic acid and syngas. Glycolic acid finds widespread application in the cosmetic sector, while syngas is a crucial component of sustainable liquid fuels. Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, is recognized as a pioneer in sustainable urban development and planning. Significant progress has been achieved in decreasing the urban area’s environmental impact. By promoting recycling and composting practices among its residents and devoting resources to expanding renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, Copenhagen is establishing itself as a sustainable urban center model (Susantono, 2018 ). In 2009, the municipal government, for instance, developed an underground plant that converts garbage into electrical energy. This process effectively lessens the necessity for additional landfill space. Methane is a component of natural gas. The production and capture of methane gas occur through waste decomposition, followed by its transportation through pipelines to specific landfill locations. Consequently, the generation of electricity in power plants is facilitated by this procedure (Themelis & Ulloa, 2007 ). As per the findings of Geron et al. (2022) , the process of cold plasma pyrolysis can transform plastics into methane, hydrogen, and ethylene. Methane and hydrogen are considered promising alternatives for sustainable fuel owing to their low emission of harmful by-products such as ash, unreacted hydrocarbons, and carbon dioxide (CO2 ). Most plastics comprise ethylene, which can be repurposed through recycling and used in subsequent industrial procedures. Diaz-Silvarrey et al. (2018)  have reported that using cold plasma pyrolysis confers the advantage of improved precision in process control, thereby facilitating the cleavage of chemical bonds in HDPE. The process of fragmentation efficiently converts high-molecular-weight hydrocarbons that are inherent in plastics into lower-molecular-weight substances. The procedure entails the transformation of plastic compounds into substitute substances, such as hydrogen and methane, for energy production and ethylene and hydrocarbons for polymer manufacturing purposes. The prompt response time exhibited by cold plasma makes the procedure efficient and has the potential to be economically advantageous.   16.3.4 SDG 12: Responsible consumption and production SDG 12, also known as “Responsible Consumption and Production,” aims to encourage the effective use of resources, eliminate waste production, and address the environmental implications of consumption and production activities. The primary focus is on waste management, which includes techniques to reduce the generation of hazardous waste and achieve a significant reduction in waste production by actions such as prevention, reduction, recycling, and reuse. One of the goals is to reduce food waste, and plastic packaging has been identified as a major contributor. The significance of plastic packaging lies in its ability to safeguard food products, thereby extending their shelf life in commercial settings. The fundamental purpose of packaging is to offer to safeguard, and it is intimately linked with reducing food wastage (de Sousa, 2021 ). Implementing advanced plastic production and waste management techniques facilitates the conscientious utilization and production of plastics. The prevalent plastic manufacturing techniques are dematerialization, substitution, and enhanced biodegradability. Establishing an economy that effectively manages plastic waste is crucial for mitigating the negative impacts of plastic on the environment. This entails implementing efficient collection and reprocessing mechanisms to minimize the extent of plastic leakage into natural ecosystems. As per the findings of Tulashie et al. (2022) , the primary techniques used for transforming plastic waste into substitute fuels within the context of a circular economy encompass recycling, reusing, and remanufacturing. Tulashie et al. (2022)  have identified that the literature that suggests that the most optimal approach involves the transformation of waste into fuel, which is distinguished by its ease of execution, cost-effectiveness, and applicability for commercial and industrial applications. There is a pressing need for increased investment in waste management, particularly in regions with low-income populations, with a significant surge in plastic production and consumption. Improving the systems necessitates the creation of more robust recycling value chains and the maximization of the economic efficiency of solid waste management. The conversion of plastic waste into fuel technology is congruent with SDG 12 across multiple dimensions. The aforementioned methodology reduces the quantity of plastic waste that would otherwise be disposed of in landfills or contaminate the environment by transforming plastic waste into an energy source. This measure facilitates the achievement of the aim of SDG 12, which is to reduce waste to a minimum. In addition, using plastic waste-to-fuel methodologies involves using nonrecyclable plastic materials that would otherwise be disposed of. Converting plastics into fuel yields significant benefits by enabling the recovery of valuable resources, thereby promoting resource efficiency and contributing to the attainment of SDG 12. This goal seeks to foster sustainable consumption and production patterns. Additionally, the utilization of fuel obtained from plastic waste has the potential to serve as a feasible alternative to  traditional energy sources. This specific fuel has the potential to reduce dependency on nonrenewable energy sources, hence contributing to the achievement of SDG 12 aim of developing sustainable energy use and production patterns. In addition, integrating plastic waste-to-fuel technology into a circular economy framework necessitates the utilization or reuse of waste resources. Converting plastic waste into fuel offers a feasible approach to attaining waste minimization and a circular economy.  16.3.5 SDG 13: Climate action Global climate change is widely observed, including increased ocean temperatures, rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and more frequent and intense extreme weather events. These changes are expected to worsen over time, as Ford et al. (2022)  noted. Firmino et al. (2023)  have proposed the possibility of an interaction between plastic pollution and climate change. The manufacture of plastics is linked to the discharge of greenhouse gases, which arise at different phases of the production cycle, spanning from the retrieval of petroleum to the ultimate degradation of plastic, leading to the liberation of methane and ethylene. On the other hand, the manifestation of extreme meteorological events exacerbates the problem of plastic contamination in both land-based and water-based ecological systems, which originates from insufficient waste management methods. Firmino et al. (2023)  assert that in achieving sustainable development, it is crucial to address plastic pollution and climate change simultaneously. The production and disposal of plastics, which are predominantly produced from nonrenewable resources, result in the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) during several stages of their existence, including the acquisition and manipulation of raw materials, fabrication, and waste management (Harma et al., 2023 ). According to research undertaken by the World Energy Council, the increase in plastic production and the incineration of plastic waste are expected to result in a considerable increase in the emission of harmful gases, such as carbon dioxide. According to the estimates, the emission levels might reach 49 million metric tonnes by 2030 and 91 million metric tonnes by 2050. Recent research by Ford et al. (2022) and Sharma et al. (2023)  projects that the plastics industry will be responsible for 10%−13% of the global warming potential attributable to all industries. It is essential to emphasize that carbon emissions from plastic waste are not confined to the production period alone. According to Sharma et al. (2023) , the decomposition of long carbon chains in plastic materials generates methane and ethylene, which have a significant warming effect. Ford et al. (2022)  have divided the impact of plastic on climate change into three distinct categories: (1) the production, transportation, and use of plastic; (2) the disposal, unregulated waste, and degradation of plastic; and (3) bio-based plastic. Converting plastic waste into fuel holds promise for addressing the issue of plastic waste that is either incinerated or deposited in landfills, thereby decreasing emissions.  The aforementioned assertion is to SDG 13, the aim of mitigating climate change by decreasing the emission of GHGs. In addition, the use of plastic waste-to-fuel technology creates an alternative to conventional finite energy sources such as coal, oil, and natural gas and lessens the dependency on traditional fossil fuels. The transition from fossil fuels to alternative energy sources is crucial in addressing climate change, as the combustion of the former produces greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide. The employment of technology to convert plastic waste into fuel represents a strategy for furthering the goal of SDG 13, which seeks to foster sustainable and clean energy alternatives.  16.3.6 SDG 14: Protection of seas and oceans Goal 14 of the sustainable development agenda pertains to the conservation and sustainable use of marine, maritime, and aquatic resources. The oceans constitute roughly 70% of the Earth’s surface and are a vital source of resources, including water, electricity, and sustenance. The ocean serves as a preventive and mitigative measure against the impacts of climate change by assimilating around 25% of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions annually. Unregulated human activities pose a significant threat to the oceans and seas, which profoundly impact billions of individuals' lives (Duarte et al., 2020 ). The preservation of thriving oceans and seas is crucial for the well-being of both humanity and the broader ecosystem. Therefore it is crucial to implement measures directed toward the restoration and conservation of marine biodiversity, as proposed by Sala et al. (2021) . Diverse marine species are threatened by ocean acidification and rising ocean temperatures, which have a substantial impact on the marine ecosystem. Implementing conservation initiatives would result in a substantial improvement in the current state of the ocean. Hoegh-Guldberg et al. (2007)  reported that a substantial percentage of coral reefs worldwide, approximately 14%, experienced degradation between 2009 and 2018. The year 2021 witnessed a significant influx of plastic waste into the global oceans, with a staggering estimate of 17 million metric tonnes. This amount constitutes a substantial portion of the total microplastic pollution, accounting for approximately 85%. Barnes (2005)  has projected that the accumulation of plastic waste discarded in the ocean is expected to increase or triple by 2040. Discarding of plastic waste into aquatic ecosystems can lead to detrimental impacts on marine organisms and seafood contamination. As per the findings of Gregory (2009) , plastic waste ingestion poses a significant threat to marine organisms, leading to potential mortality due to choking, intestinal blockage, and malnourishment. The increasing demand for food, energy, and water burdens the ocean and its resources. The effects of climate change include increased ocean temperatures, abrupt and severe flooding incidents, and intensified storm patterns. The modifications under  consideration substantially affect diverse facets of human existence, encompassing sustenance, the financial system, and general well-being. This holds significant relevance, considering that nearly half of the world’s population inhabits coastal areas in close proximity (Vaidyanathan, 2023 ). Urgent measures are necessary to reinstate the ecological balance of the ocean in order to cater to the escalating need for seafood and employment prospects. Various approaches are available to conserve and protect global marine ecosystems. The conversion of plastic waste into fuel holds potential for both energy generation and waste management. The process of converting plastic waste is intricate. Belden et al. (2021)  presented a potential remedy for marine plastic waste by utilizing specialized vessels that can extract and transform plastics into fuel. The aforementioned procedure produces the electrical energy that can be used for both the conversion and propulsion of the ship’s engines. As per the findings of Grande et al. (2021) , hydrothermal liquefaction is a process that entails exposing the product to elevated pressures of 27,500 kPa and temperatures of up to 550°C, leading to the disintegration of its constituent polymers. According to Lowe (2021) , a collective of French sailors collaborated to develop a watercraft that could collect plastic waste from the ocean and transform it into fuel for the vessel’s propulsion. The procedure entails the utilization of conveyor belts to collect refuse materials while the vessel is in transit, followed by filtration and subsequent transfer into a combustion chamber. The turbine will be fueled by the combustion of plastic in the burner, enabling electricity production for the vessel. Apart from the process of transforming marine plastics into fuel, there are alternative approaches that can facilitate the conservation and restoration of marine biodiversity. The aforementioned techniques encompass establishing novel conservation zones, rehabilitating deteriorated coral reefs, and reforestation of mangroves, seagrass, and kelp ecosystems. According to Ounanian et al. (2018) , implementing such measures can aid coastal communities in adapting to the dynamic environment and reducing the impact of storms and flooding. Attaining a sustainable future necessitates meticulous governance of oceans and seas, given their pivotal role as the main drivers of the worldwide system that sustains the habitability of Earth for human beings. The ocean is a vital source of resources crucial for human survival, including potable water, sustenance, precipitation, shorelines, weather patterns, and atmospheric oxygen. Therefore the preservation of the ocean should remain a top priority.  16.3.7 SDG 15: Repair ecosystems and retain biodiversity According to Kalervo Ahlberg (2013) , “biodiversity” refers to the multitude of living organisms found in various habitats, including diversity at the species level, between species, and within ecosystems. The term biodiversity has a broader connotation than the sheer variety of species. The concept encompasses the unique genetic differences  and characteristics among members of a given species, including a wide range of cultivated plant types and aquatic and land-based ecological systems. As mentioned earlier, the ecosystems encompass a diverse range of habitats, such as coastal regions, forests, wetlands, grasslands, mountains, and deserts. The 15th goal of sustainable development aims to address the reduction of biodiversity, cessation of desertification, promotion of sustainable forest management, and revitalization of sustainable utilization of terrestrial ecosystems (United Nation, 2015 ). Furthermore, the presence of various biological species plays a crucial role in providing essential resources such as nourishment, hydration, and materials for the production of textiles. According to Frison et al. (2011) , the previously mentioned practice promotes the welfare of individuals and strengthens their resilience to the impacts of climate change. Furthermore, it creates job prospects across diverse sectors, including forestry, fisheries, and agriculture. Undertaking significant efforts toward biodiversity conservation and the sustainable utilization of its constituents is of utmost importance. The inability to attain this goal will lead to the failure to accomplish the 2030 Agenda. Ecosystems are essential foundations for human societies, providing the requisite nourishment for our economic structures. The classification of ecosystems is commonly divided into two primary categories: terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Ecosystem services encompass a range of both direct and indirect mechanisms by which ecosystems facilitate the improvement of human welfare by converting resources, including but not limited to clean water, nutrient-rich food, and fertile soil (World Health Organization, WHO, 2021 ). The preservation of resilient ecosystems is of utmost importance due to their provision of nourishment, conservation of soil integrity, improvement of air quality, regulation of climatic patterns, and facilitation of water filtration. Ecosystems are an essential source of medicinal raw materials and resources, such as medicinal plants, fungi, and fruits. Importantly, the assessment of the health and adaptability of an ecosystem is frequently founded on the measure of its biodiversity. The quantification of biodiversity is achieved by combining the measures of species richness and evenness. The adaptability of ecosystems and their ability to thrive in the face of various threats, such as climate change, pollution, and human activities, are a plausible phenomenon. Despite the potential endangerment of certain species, ecosystems can exhibit resilience and continue to flourish. Eliminating complete ecosystems can lead to the annihilation of diverse species (World Health Organization, WHO, 2021 ) Pollution has a detrimental effect on animals, evident through behavior changes, habitat destruction, and other adverse outcomes. The potential disturbance of the delicate balance of biodiversity is a significant concern arising from pollutants such as chemicals, fossil fuels, and plastics (Sintayehu, 2018 ). Plastic surfaces have the potential to act as a reservoir for pathogenic microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and protists, which can cause a range of diseases. Releasing compounds such as phthalates and  Bisphenol A (BPA) from microplastics can disrupt the endocrine system of both vertebrates and invertebrates. Plastic materials can release various chemical compounds into aquatic and terrestrial environments, encompassing dangerous additives, parabens, flame retardants, synthetic dyes, and other substances. Furthermore, plastics can attach to diverse particles, resulting in protracted existence within ecosystems (Yuan et al., 2022 ). Wildlife frequently comes across plastic containers while foraging for food, resulting in the entanglement of their extremities, heads, or wings owing to their curious and ravenous disposition. Plastic ingestion by animals can cause intestinal obstructions and fatal outcomes (Wadhwa, 2019 ). Palmer and Stewart (2020)  argue that ecosystem restoration is a feasible approach to mitigate the adverse effects of degradation, restore biodiversity, and reinstate ecological functionality. Restoring ecosystems holds promise in realizing a sustainable and resilient future for all members of society. Converting plastic waste into fuel offers a feasible strategy for accomplishing ecological restoration. The process of incineration is regarded as a viable approach for the recycling of plastic materials. The feasibility of converting plastic waste into energy and thermal energy has been established. It is imperative to acknowledge that this particular procedure has the potential to generate perilous substances, including heavy metals and acidic gases. The utilization of chemical recycling has surfaced as a viable and auspicious substitute for transforming plastic waste into fuel. However, the effectiveness of this technology is dependent on achieving exceptionally high temperatures exceeding 300°C, which results in high costs and inefficiencies, according to Lange (2021) . To tackle this problem, the researchers conducted experiments using various metals as catalysts to accelerate the conversion process while manipulating other factors, such as temperature and pressure. Chen et al. (2021)  discovered that using carbon and ruthenium metal as a catalyst at a temperature of 220°C enabled the conversion of 90% of plastic into petrol within 1 hour. This methodology was found to be comparatively more practical and economical. The recently uncovered data have the potential to offer a feasible and economical method for accelerating the plastic recycling process in the near term. The utilization of this technology exhibits potential in pursuing the global goal of reducing plastic waste. The researchers are endeavoring to broaden the reach of their work and introduce it to the market.   16.4 Challenges and opportunities In recent times, there has been a significant surge in attention toward the technology of converting plastic waste into fuel as a feasible resolution to the mounting problem of plastic waste contamination. As aforementioned, technology has the capability to transform gathered waste materials into valuable fuel sources, including diesel and petrol. According to Fahim et al. (2021) , the implementation of this specific methodology  has the potential to significantly decrease the quantity of plastic waste that is deposited in landfills, while also enabling the reuse of valuable resources. Despite the potential advantages of plastic waste-to-fuel technology, several issues must be addressed, such as the irregularity of feedstocks, the financial feasibility of the procedure, and the enhancement of energy efficiency. The conversion of plastic waste into usable fuels involves complex chemical processes that are susceptible to the impact of variations in the feedstock. The variability in the composition and properties of feedstocks used in these procedures presents a considerable obstacle in achieving uniform product quality and output. Maafa (2021)  asserts that fluidized-bed reactors are more advantageous than batch reactors because they can operate without frequent feedstock charging and multiple restarts. The economic viability of plastic waste-to-fuel technologies presents a notable obstacle, given that these methods frequently involve considerable operational expenses and require significant capital outlay. According to Zein et al. (2022) , the significant decrease in financial resources can be primarily ascribed to operational expenses, which total approximately £1.46 million annually. The importance of energy efficiency cannot be overstated in converting plastic waste into fuel, given that the process can be resource-intensive and require significant quantities of water and other resources. The investigation revealed that the overall energy usage (converted to primary energy) associated with manufacturing original polyethylene and its subsequent transformation into packaging amounted to 109.2–115.2 MJ/kg. Marczak (2022)  reported that a factor of approximately 5 increased the calorific value of the polymer. Using plastic waste-to-fuel systems offers a potentially viable resolution to the problem of plastic contamination. This approach entails the transformation of discarded plastic materials into a usable form of energy that can be used for diverse applications. It is crucial to take into account and mitigate the possible environmental consequences that may arise as a result of the conversion procedure. The primary ecological concerns relate to the techniques used to transform plastic waste into fuel. The conversion of plastic waste into fuel has the potential to pose a significant environmental challenge due to the generation of substantial greenhouse gas emissions. The process of converting plastic waste into fuel has the potential to release greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, into the atmosphere, thereby exacerbating the issue of global warming. Royer et al. (2018)  reported that the release of trace gases from virgin low-density polyethylene displayed a rise dependent on time. According to the findings of the study, the production rates of methane, ethylene, ethane, and propylene were observed to be 5.8 nmol/g/d, 14.5 nmol/g/d, 3.9 nmol/g/d, and 9.7 nmol/g/d, respectively, after a 212–day incubation period. The hydrocarbon gases were observed to form upon subjecting environmentally aged polymers to a minimum of 152 days of incubation in water. Furthermore, it has been noted that methane and ethylene emissions originating from low-density polyethylene (LDPE) are notably  elevated when exposed to air incubation compared with water incubation. Specifically, the former displays emission rates that are 2 and 76 times greater than the latter, respectively. Furthermore, the utilization of fossil fuels in the conversion process may intermittently give rise to the discharge of greenhouse gases. The conversion of plastic waste into fuel systems raises environmental concerns related to water usage and potential pollution. The conversion process usually involves a large consumption of water, which may result in a possible water shortage in areas with limited access to water resources (Evode et al., 2021 ). Furthermore, the poor treatment of wastewater produced during the process of conversion has the potential to pollute aquatic environments. The conversion of plastic waste into fuel is a significant environmental concern closely associated with land use. As per the findings of Fargione et al. (2009) , the production of feedstocks required for the conversion process may demand substantial land usage, which could lead to the elimination of natural habitats and a decline in biodiversity. Moreover, the siting of conversion facilities could affect land use, mainly if such facilities are situated in ecologically sensitive areas. In addition to the ecological concerns, it is crucial to consider the possible societal implications of the procedures utilized in transforming plastic refuse into energy. This section analyzes the primary social obstacles to converting plastic waste into fuel. The social concern surrounding using plastic waste-to-fuel techniques and its reception by the general public represents a significant societal challenge linked to these procedures. According to Kumar et al. (2021) , engagement in activities near residential areas may give rise to apprehensions regarding safety and environmental impact among specific segments of the populace. Gaining public endorsement for establishing facilities that convert plastic waste into fuel can be time-consuming and arduous. Integrating equity considerations is vital to the social intricacies of converting plastic waste into fuel. According to Mihai et al. (2022) , it is suggested that ensuring an equitable distribution of benefits and drawbacks among the various stakeholders and factions involved in such procedures may not be assured. Social inequality and resistance toward implementing plastic-to-fuel plants can be observed in specific geographic locations, including rural and urban areas. One further societal concern related to the procedures involved in transforming plastic waste into fuel pertains to the potential impact on the informal waste management sector. Implementing plastic-to-fuel facilities has the potential to result in the displacement of individuals employed in the informal waste sector. The sustenance of these workers is contingent upon the acquisition and monetization of plastic refuse. Within Latin America, a significant number of individuals, ranging from 500,000 to 4 million, engage in subsistence activities by scavenging through refuse (Marello & Helwege, 2014 ). The communities affected by this may encounter significant social and economic disruptions. Although plastic waste-to-fuel technologies present particular difficulties, they promise to improve resource efficiency and advance the circular economy.  Plastic-to-waste conversion process is important as it reduces the environmental pollution and prevents accumulation of waste. According to Nguyen et al. (2021) , the methods entail the transformation of discarded plastic into viable energy, offering a possible resolution to the predicament of plastic waste buildup in landfills and ecological contamination. One of the benefits is the generation of value from refuse. The utilization of the aforementioned techniques possesses the capability to produce value from a hitherto underutilized resource by transforming plastic waste into energy that can be utilized. The comparative analysis of the plastic oil’s quality, both before and after upgrading through slow pyrolysis, can be used to assess its efficacy relative to standard diesel fuel. The pyrolysis process can attain plastic oil yields of as high as 95% by weight. The aforementioned factors have the potential to promote sustainable economic development and reduce dependence on nonrenewable sources of energy. This technology also facilitates the attainment of the SDG targets for sustainable production and consumption. This presents an additional potential benefit of these techniques. Implementing these procedures holds promise for making noteworthy contributions toward achieving diverse SDG targets related to sustainable production and consumption. According to the United Nation (2015) , attaining their objective is facilitated by promoting responsible resource utilization and waste reduction. The implementation of plastic waste-to-fuel initiatives has the potential to generate employment opportunities and foster economic growth by producing novel employment opportunities in energy generation, refuse-to-handle, and engineering sectors (Fahim et al., 2021 ). Furthermore, establishing facilities that convert plastic waste into fuel can stimulate economic growth in regions with limited economic prospects. Moreover, using plastic waste-to-fuel technologies holds promise in providing investment prospects. Sharma et al. (2020)  posit that establishing such protocols has the potential to generate investment prospects in emerging technologies and infrastructure. In addition, producing fuel from plastic waste holds promise in creating a new market for recovered resources, which could lead to the generation of economic prospects for individuals involved in waste collection and recycling. In addition to fostering the growth of emerging markets and industries, advancing technologies that convert plastic waste into fuel can facilitate the expansion of established ones. According to Fahim et al. (2021) , conversion of plastic waste to fuel production can facilitate diversification in the energy industry and reduce dependence on nonrenewable fossil fuels. In addition, manufacturing recycled materials from plastic waste holds promise for promoting the development of environmentally sustainable packaging and other goods. Marczak (2022)  also stated that implementing these processes can aid in mitigating climate change by reducing GHGs emission by decreasing dependence on fossil fuels. Additionally, we were able to lessen our dependency on imported crude oil. The production of sustainable energy is an ancillary benefit that can be obtained through plastic waste-to-fuel methodologies. Renewable energy  sources, such as solar or wind power, can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve sustainability of energy during the conversion process (Maafa, 2021 ). Adopting clean sources of energy can also hasten the development of sustainable energy systems. Success in turning plastic trash into fuel has been demonstrated in several case studies. Fahim et al. (2021)  have reported on the demonstration of the Polymers to Fuel Technology (PFT) program in Indonesia, exhibiting the potential for converting plastic waste into petrol. The project resulted in innovative employment opportunities and economic benefits for waste collectors and recyclers, offering substantial potential for the indigenous population of Indonesia.  16.5 Conclusion and future outlook In summary, the outcomes of this investigation demonstrate significant ramifications for subsequent inquiries in this domain. In subsequent research endeavors, it will be imperative to take into account the constraints inherent in this study and endeavor to rectify them. Additional investigation is required to comprehensively comprehend the intricate connections among the variables scrutinized in this research. This research offers a significant addition to the current body of literature and establishes a foundation for further investigation. The current investigation has provided a comprehensive review on plastic waste, including its implications for SDGs and specific targets related to the advancement of good health and well-being (SDG 3), access to clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), the development of sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), protection of marine life and oceans (SDG 14), and the rehabilitation of ecosystems and conservation of biodiversity (SDG 15). In conclusion, the findings aforementioned lead to a definitive inference. This chapter explored the feasibility of employing plastic waste-to-fuel conversion as a practical strategy to tackle waste management and energy generation issues. The findings underscore the urgent need for coordinated efforts at various levels to address the challenges posed by plastic waste. Accomplishing the SDGs requires a holistic approach involving multiple actors, such as governmental bodies, industries, academic institutions, and civil society organizations. Raising awareness and providing education regarding the adverse impacts of plastic waste on human health, ecosystems, and the environment are of utmost importance. Promoting SDG 12, centered on responsible consumption and production, necessitates implementing and enforcing policies and regulations that provide incentives for reducing, reusing, and recycling plastic waste. The aforementioned measures entail the progress and dissemination of cutting-edge technologies to transform plastic waste into fuel and the establishment of efficient waste management systems and infrastructure. Moreover, efforts to combat climate change, as outlined in SDG 13, play a crucial role in mitigating the environmental effects of plastic pollution. Reducing the production of plastic waste and  emissions can considerably aid in mitigating climate change and attaining global climate goals. The successful execution of efficient methodologies, such as adopting sustainable substitutes, advocacy for principles of circular economy, and endorsement of research and innovation in managing plastic waste, mandates cooperation among heterogeneous domains. To promote the progress of the discipline, upcoming research endeavors should give precedence to evaluating the comprehensive environmental and economic viability of techniques for converting plastic waste into fuel. Moreover, additional analysis is warranted regarding complementary SDGs that intersect with plastic waste management. The systematic and ongoing assessment of progress toward achieving the SDGs can be a valuable mechanism for informing policy development and decision-making processes. A comprehensive approach is required to address the problem of plastic waste. This approach should encompass various facets, including technological advancements, policy interventions, public awareness campaigns, and global cooperation. Achieving a sustainable future can be facilitated by aligning efforts with the SDGs, reducing plastic waste, and significantly decreasing its negative impact on the environment and human health.
