               Environmental change and the projections for a growing population have shifted the way people think about food. Responsible for the rapid deterioration of ecological and human well-being, the Western diet requires a dramatic change to avoid both malnourishment and undernourishment. In recent years, flexitarian ways of eating represent efforts to cut meat intake and the unsustainable high-calorie diets in high-income countries while improving human health and responding to animal welfare. Plant-based meat analogs are emerging as transition foods toward more plant-rich diets for flexitarians, meat-avoiders, and the mainstream consumer. They also contribute to the ambitious global agenda of the United Nations through the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Facilitating flexitarian approaches with plant-based meat analogs aligns with many SDGs, and the chapter explores these synergies while acknowledging the need for further research and improvement to respond to any societal concerns.

It entered the mainstream Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary in 2012 (Italie, 2018 ), the Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries in 2014 (Derbyshire, 2017 ), and then gradually spread to all dictionaries. Microsoft Word’s dictionary also recognizes “flexitarian” but is yet to accept “flexitarianism,” which is the term describing a flexitarian eating pattern. A flexitarian, or a flexible vegetarian, is depicted as a person who adheres to a semivegetarian diet. The origin of this approach lies in reducing the intake of red meat and other animal-based foods due to considerations related to personal health, animal welfare, and environmental concerns (Dagevos, 2021 ). Evidence from the United States shows that age and gender are also factors, with older and female consumers more likely to be flexitarians (Glanbia, 2021 ). Such people sometimes eat meat, fish, dairy, and other animal-based products, but usually they avoid them. Abstaining from eating animal-derived food products, particularly meat, is increasing in popularity, leading to the rise of various plant-rich diets, including flexitarian, vegetarian, and vegan.  The development of alternative protein sources, such as plant-based meat analogs, is contributing to this trend. When desired, meat reduction is easy to follow (Bogueva et al., 2021 ), and many consumers are inclined to do so (Peschel & Grebitus, 2023 ) due to increasing awareness about the environmental, ethical, and health concerns associated with consuming large quantities of animal products. The shift toward more plant-rich diets has the potential to positively impact both human and environmental health by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, preserving natural resources and biodiversity, as well as promoting healthier lifestyles (Derbyshire, 2017; Raphaely & Marinova, 2014 ). Flexitarianism is seen as a moral responsibility and an action that would have an immediate impact with numerous cobenefits for human health, animal welfare, and the natural environment. Alternative plant-based meat analog products are developed with the aim to reduce the high environmental impact of the consumption of livestock-derived foods while offering consumers similar sensory experiences in terms of taste, texture, appearance, and smell (Andreani et al., 2023 ). The popularity of these products is growing faster (The Good Food Institute, 2019 ), and they are seen to support reduced and infrequent meat consumption and the adoption of flexitarianism (Dagevos, 2021 ). They require less land, generate lower GHG emissions, use less water, cause less pollution, and no antibiotics are applied (The Good Food Institute, 2019 ). Their nutritional profiles and health benefits, however, vary with research underway to reduce the differences with livestock-based meats (Gorissen et al., 2018 ). Some researchers argue that plant-based analogs to processed meat have the best chance to replace livestock-based meat (Michel et al., 2021 ). The global sales of plant-based proteins are estimated at US$6 billion in 2022 (The Good Food Institute, 2022 ) and are expected to grow with a compound annual growth rate of 14% until 2024 (Biospringer, 2022 ). Flexitarianism offers a flexible and more sustainable way of eating that aligns with a range of personal and global health and sustainability goals. The plant-based meat analogs are designed to look, taste, and feel like meat, assist in transitioning toward a more plant-rich diet (Marinova, Bogueva, Wu, et al., 2022 ), and can be used by flexitarians. They are often made from ingredients, such as soy, wheat, peas, lentils, or mushrooms, and can be used to replace a variety of recognizable meat products, including burgers, sausages, meatballs, and mince. They aim to provide a source of protein, vitamins, and minerals while reducing the environmental impact of agriculture and not sacrificing consumers’ taste experience. The cooking methods used for the plant-based meat analogs also resemble those of traditional livestock-derived products, including grilling, barbecuing, or pan-frying, with attention given to mimicking the initial and final color of the foodstuffs (Ishaq et al., 2022 ). Consideration is given to the digestibility and gastrointestinal behavior of the plant-based meat analogs as well as to issues related to food safety, allergenicity, and quality control (Ishaq et al., 2022 ). While general consumers are slow in embracing all meat alternatives, plant-based analogs appear to have the highest acceptance level compared to insects or  cultured meat (Onwezen et al., 2021 ). Furthermore, acceptance of plant-based meat analogs seems to be much higher among flexitarians, particularly if no genetically modified ingredients are used in their production (Szenderák et al., 2022 ). In Europe, 53% of flexitarian consumers would eat and 49% would regularly buy plant-based meat analogs to replace animal meat in their diets (Smart Protein, 2021 ). The health and environmental characteristics of the plant-derived meat analogs are shown to outperform their animal-based counterparts with better ecological indicators in terms of GHG emissions, land use, energy, and water consumption, and application of pesticides and fertilizers (Bryant, 2022 ). Their nutritional profiles offer a range of health benefits, including contributing to weight loss, cholesterol reduction, healthy gut bacteria, and potential avoidance of noncommunicable diseases (Bryant, 2022 ). Given the many benefits of plant-based meat analogs compared to their animal-sourced counterparts and their role in flexitarianism, they can also facilitate the achieving of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly in regions where the consumption of livestock meat is high, such as in the United States, Australia, Canada, and Europe. This, however, requires support and active engagement across all sectors of society to transition away from the current preferences for meat to better plant-rich dietary patterns. The UN SDGs are encouraging a global agenda for a sustainability transition in which food plays a major role. With its increasing popularity, flexitarianism is contributing to this global agenda. The shares of people who have reduced their meat intake combined with those who are considering doing so are relatively high, respectively 78% and 92% in China, 65% and 79% in Europe, and 54% and 68% in the United States (Meat Atlas, 2021 ). By supporting such choices, plant-based meat alternatives are also contributing to sustainability. There is, however, a lot more to be done to facilitate flexitarian choices in achieving the SDGs. We first examine the role of awareness-raising, increased availability of plant-based meat and affordability, understanding perceptions and expectations, promoting technology and innovation, and supporting policy change as ways to facilitate flexitarian approaches for the SDGs. This is followed by an analysis of the links between selected SDGs and plant-based meat analogs. The overall message is clear. Any plant-based meat alternatives should not replace healthy food options, such as fruit, vegetables, legumes, seeds, and nuts, but by reducing the share of animal meat in the human diet, they can help achieve many of the SDG targets.  22.2 Raising awareness Publicizing an important cause is a central action in the process of raising awareness, as is the case for the need for dietary change through adopting flexitarianism. The aim of awareness raising is similar to strategic social marketing, where  consumers are informed and educated and their attitudes, behaviors, and beliefs are influenced toward achieving a defined purpose for the broader social good (French & Gordon, 2020 ). Consumers have to be in a position to be willing to take informed decisions about the need to reduce their red meat consumption, the dietary option with the heaviest environmental footprint (Poore & Nemecek, 2018 ), and replace it with more environmentally sustainable options. Educating the currently unaware consumers about the large impact that meat consumption has on the environment and, on the other hand, about the environmental benefits of plant-based foods, is imperative. To this needs to be added general awareness about the environmental footprints of our food choices, including those of the hundreds of plant-based meat analogs and their potential contribution to achieving the UN SDGs. Plant-based meat analogs should be seen as transition foods that allow meat-eaters to cut their dependence on eating livestock-derived products. Role models can also contribute toward speeding up such a transition. For example, during the Happier Than Ever 2022 world tour of the award-winning American performer Billie Eilish, the Support+Feed organization, which she wholeheartedly supports, called for people to replace at least one meal per day with plant-based options. Incorporating plant-based meat alternatives into consumers’ food choices, being on a daily or weekly basis, would be beneficial, especially for heavy meat-eating consumers. These options can be seen, especially by people who are willing to adopt a flexitarian diet, as a means of support for animal meat reduction and toward achieving a stable dietary change. Social marketing to raise awareness can include sharing information about the environmental impact of animal agriculture, health benefits of plant-based diets, and animal welfare concerns (Bogueva et al., 2017 ). From the point of view of consumers, raising awareness is needed to address any concerns they may have about the processing process used in the production of plant-based meat analogs. Many researchers argue that these products aim to replicate the sensory experience but not the nutritional quality of meat (van Vliet et al., 2020 ). If consumers are shifting toward flexitarianism, the specific nutritional quality of these alternatives is less important in the big picture, and they can be used as a transition to dietary change. The nutritional quality of these products may also be tailored to the stage of life and other consumer requirements. Communicating this information is important in awareness raising.  22.3 Increasing availability and affordability There has been a long-standing awareness that climate change will disturb all dimensions of food security, including availability, accessibility, utilization, and food systems’ stability (Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, 2008 ). Increasing the availability and affordability of food and improving its distribution at a global level are very important. However, the challenge of achieving  a sustainable supply of enough food for a still-growing world population cannot be solved by increasing production, even using new technologies, as land and natural resources are limited (Berners-Lee et al., 2018 ). Furthermore, expanding food production will invariably lead to a loss of biodiversity. Major changes in the socioeconomic and geopolitical conditions are needed in many places across the globe to ensure reliable food supply, but even more important are radical shifts in people’s diets in wealthier parts of the world toward more plant-based options (Berners-Lee et al., 2018 ). Plant-based meat analogs should be widely available and easily accessible for consumers at affordable prices. This can include stocking them in grocery stores, incorporating them in restaurant menus, and communicating to people how to use them, including cooking and storage requirements (Yesuraj et al., 2022 ). These products should be seen as a mainstream option and not assigned to be used by people with particular or special dietary preferences. On the other hand, animal meat production continues to be subsidized, and its products are often tax-exempt (Springmann & Freund, 2022 ). The plant-based meat analogs do not enjoy such privileges, which, combined with their nascent markets, makes these food products more expensive. Their price should properly reflect not only production costs but also avoidance of negative health impacts, that is, negative internalities, and positive environmental and population health benefits, that is, negative externalities (Griffith et al., 2018 ). Making plant-based meat analogs available and affordable may require government support as the market develops. For those who are embracing flexitarianism, food should be affordable and not more expensive.  22.4 Understanding perceptions and expectations Understanding consumer perceptions and expectations of livestock-derived meat and meat alternatives, including plant-based analogs, is crucial. Being a flexitarian does not necessarily make a consumer have a higher acceptance rate for plant-based meat analogs (Dagevos, 2021 ). Of importance are also the occasions in which consumers are most willing to substitute meat. The analysis by Dagevos (2021)  argues that consumers perceive meat analogs as not appropriate for more formal situations where they have to avoid peer pressure and being judged for their food choices. Hence, they tend to blend and adopt the eating behaviors of their peers (Dagevos, 2021 ), while they eat meat analogs completely unobserved or with their close family and friends (Dagevos, 2021; Szenderák et al., 2022 ). The effects of a changing human diet on environmental sustainability, and especially the associated GHG emissions along the food supply chain, are clear, but an analysis of the supply of dietary proteins and micronutrients is often lacking (Berners-Lee et al., 2018; Rös et al., 2017 ). In countries where hunger and nutrient deficiencies prevail, animal meat is an important source of nutrition; on  the other hand, overconsumption of animal meat is associated with a range of health concerns, such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain types of cancer (Szenderák et al., 2022 ). More research evidence is needed as to how plant-based meat alternatives meet nutritional requirements. Identifying the characteristics and needs of the people consuming plant-based meat analogs, and how they can be satisfied, could open not only new research directions but, most importantly, opportunities for product design and development.  22.5 Promoting technology and innovation Plant-based meat analogs can be seen as making good economic contributions as they promote the development of new food technologies and businesses. They create such research and development opportunities for the food industry, contributing to all pillars of sustainable development. Encouraging innovation in plant-based meat analogs to improve their taste, texture, appearance, smell, and nutritional content with respect to food safety and nutrition is necessary for maintaining consumers’ interest in these products (Bogueva & McClements, 2022 ). This can help to make them more appealing to consumers and encourage flexitarians and mainstream eaters not only to have a one-off try of these plant-based options but to have repetitive consumption. Plant-based meat analogs are without a doubt the outcome of advancements in food technology. In the search to mimic and re-create with a plant-based meat analog an experience similar to a particular animal protein, various technologies, processing innovations, and new techniques are used, such as high- or low-moisture extrusion processing, shear-cell technology, or freeze structuring. Consumers are aware of this and currently view these products as very heavily processed and, therefore, no better than junk food (Bohrer, 2019; Lacy-Nichols et al., 2021; Michel et al., 2021 ). Responding to such a negative image requires convincing technological arguments that put into perspective the various food groups, including whole fruit, vegetables, nuts, legumes, and tubers, as well as seaweed.  22.6 Supporting policy changes Flexitarianism can be a driver for advocating for policies that support the production and consumption of plant-based meat analogs. These can include policies that promote sustainable agriculture and supply of key plant-based ingredients taking into consideration consumer attitudes toward genetic modification of, for example, soy and other cultures. Other policy changes relate to the reduction of the environmental impact of existing agricultural practices, such as crop rotation circular and other principles of circular agriculture (Marinova & Bogueva, 2022 ). Policies that promote healthy and sustainable diets, including dietary guidelines, are also needed.   22.7 Flexitarianism, plant-based meat analogs, and Sustainable Development Goals Many SDGs can benefit from a flexitarian approach through plant-based meat analogs (see Fig. 22.1  ). These products should not be replacing the healthy intake of fruit, vegetables, nuts, legumes, tubers, and other wholesome plants, as well as macroalgae such as seaweed. However, they can serve as a transition food in a global sustainability agenda where diets are nutritionally adequate, environmentally sound, economically viable, and socially and culturally acceptable (Reisch et al., 2013; Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations & Biodiversity, 2012 ). Many of the 17 SDGs and their 169 targets and 304 indicators are related to sustainable diets and food systems and therefore can be facilitated by flexitarian approaches with plant-based meat analogs. The 2017 FAO report “Food and Agriculture: Driving Action across the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” illustrates the synergies among all SDGs, and the way we feed people across the globe with the overarching aim “to produce more and healthier food in a sustainable way with fewer resources, reducing encroachment on natural ecosystems, including forests and wetlands” (Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, 2017 , p. 14). In Fig. 22.1 , we have represented the SDGs that are most related to plant-based meat analogs, positioning those with a direct link (SDGs 2, 3, 12, 13, and 15) in the internal circle and those with synergistic effects (SDGs 1, 6, 7, 9, 16, and 17) on the external circle. 22.7.1 SDG 2: Zero hunger The global population is projected to increase to 9.7 billion by 2050 (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2019 ), and these people will need to enjoy a healthy diet. At present, we have a large share of the global population overweight or obese, estimated at 38% or 2.6 million people in 2020 and projected to increase to more than 50% or 4 billion people by 2035 (World Obesity, 2023 ), as well as 8.9% of the world population or 690 million people affected by hunger and undernourishment in 2020 (Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations et al., 2020 ). An alarming 30% of the world population, or 2.4 billion people, were food-insecure, lacking regular access to adequate nutrition (United Nations, 2022 ). The disparity between malnourishment and undernourishment is further exacerbated by inefficiencies along the food supply chains, wastage, and poor resource allocation (Bajželj et al., 2014 ). In 2013 it was estimated that 1.3 billion tonnes of food were lost or wasted yearly, which is equivalent to a carbon footprint of 3.3 billion tonnes of CO2 e, 250 km3  in lost water, 1.4 billion hectares of land (or 28% of the planet’s agricultural area), and 24% of the total available calories (Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, 2013 ). With an increasing world population and if all current dietary trends remain unchanged, global food production will need to increase by at   least 60%, notwithstanding the existing natural limitations (Matharu et al., 2017; Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, 2015 ). To this, it should also be added that climate change is intensifying the risk of hunger worldwide (Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, 2015 ). Due to climate change-intensified events, including increased heat waves, flooding, hurricanes, tsunamis, droughts, desertification, social destabilization, and other disasters, human migration, and starvation are exacerbating food insecurity. A major role in this plays the misappropriation of resources for animal-based food production (Marinova & Bogueva, 2022 ). Two compelling avenues to combat world hunger and malnutrition are expanding the adoption of plant-rich diets and curbing food waste. In such a situation, flexitarian approaches would not be enough, and a speedy transition toward more plant-rich diets is required, particularly in Western countries. The existing production of crops is adequate to secure a sufficient amount of food for 10 billion people (Berners-Lee et al., 2018 ; Holt-Giménez et al., 2012 ), which is higher than the predicted rise of the global population to 9.7 billion by 2050 (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2019 ). However, to achieve this, significant changes are needed in replacing meat and dairy with plant-based options, particularly in wealthy societies. There should be greater encouragement and acceptance of human-edible crops currently used as animal feed, particularly corn, and soybeans, for direct human consumption (Berners-Lee et al., 2018 ). Plant-based meat analogs can play a part in the transition to more plant-rich diets and away from livestock-derived foods, particularly for those who are accustomed to the taste and feel of animal flesh. However, further research and development are needed to produce foodstuffs that are safe, nutritious, and protective of the planet’s ecosystems. Furthermore, for achieving SDG 2, it is important to explore new avenues for supplying proteins and other nutrients by exploiting underutilized edible crops or previously unused parts of crops. This will improve the diversity in our food systems. As far as plant-based meat analogs are concerned, the requirement for consumers to be able to make informed and rational choices also needs to be met (Berners-Lee et al., 2018 ).  22.7.2 SDG 3: Good health and well-being Good health starts with nutrition (Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, 2017 ). Together with sustainability, health is an important driver for reducing meat consumption to achieve better physical outcomes. A flexitarian approach can be a facilitator in this direction. Many ingredients are used in plant-based meat analogs, such as soy, peas, wheat, fava, other beans, and legumes. The healthfulness of plant-based meat analogs can be evaluated in different ways, including measuring the effect of eating these substitutes on nutrient content (e.g., energy, protein, vitamins, and minerals) and their nutritional density. Regarding SDG 3, different considerations may apply regarding the various ingredients used in the analogs. For instance, despite the health benefits of soy-based foods, such  as beneficial effects (more pronounced for women than men) on risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Messina, 2016 ), breast cancer, prostate cancer (Applegate et al., 2018 ), and colorectal cancer (Yu et al., 2016 ), many consumers are concerned about potential allergenicity levels and genetic modifications of some of the soy used in the making of plant-based meat analogs (Bogueva & McClements, 2022 ). Based on the nutrient content of foods or diets, several indices have been developed to assess their quality (Arsenault et al., 2012; Drewnowski & Fulgoni, 2014; Drewnowski, 2009 ). Such assessments have some conceptual and technical challenges around which nutrients to include, what type of calculations to present (grams, kcal, or serving size), what references to be used for the recommended daily allowances, and so on (Hallström et al., 2018 ). In addition, any results related to the nutrient quality of foods based on nutrient profiling are highly dependent on the design of the actual profiling method. An example of a designated and established nutrient profiling method is the Australian Five Star system (Commonwealth of Australia, 2014 ). Such indices are informative for consumers interested in looking after their health and well-being who also tend to have better nutritional knowledge (Kopplin & Rausch, 2022 ). A study of the nutritional profiles of plant-based meat analogs available for sale in Australia revealed that overall they had a higher health star rating compared to their animal meat equivalents; however, they had a slightly higher sugar content—0.7 g/100 g more than the meat equivalents (Melville et al., 2023 ). In a flexitarian diet, disease prevention and better health are some of the main benefits, related mostly to the decreased intake of animal-based foods. Health is also the most common motivator for people to follow a flexitarian diet (Malek & Umberger, 2021 ). However, when it comes to plant-based meat alternatives, animal welfare seems to play a major role. A study in Germany found that dietary behavior, such as omnivore, flexitarian, vegetarian, or vegan, played only a minor role in shaping consumers’ attitudes toward plant-based food substitutes, such as plant-based meat analogs, while no influence of health consciousness or environmental concerns was identified (Kopplin & Rausch, 2022 ). This shows that consumer messages regarding plant-based meat analogs should be different to those associated with wholesome fruits and vegetables, as their essence of replacing and mimicking animal meat is distinctly unique. In view of SDG 3, emphasizing the plant-based nature of the analogs is not enough, as transparency about ultra-processing, food safety, and health qualities is also needed (Bogueva & McClements, 2022 ; Lacy-Nichols et al., 2021 ). At any stage, consumers should not underestimate the nutritional complexity and health benefits of eating whole foods (van Vliet et al., 2020 ).  22.7.3 SDG 12: Responsible consumption and production Humanity’s food choices have significant consequences not only for human health and well-being but also affect the planet’s ecosystems in terms of land and  freshwater use, natural resources, deforestation, biodiversity loss, antimicrobial resistance, and so on. Between 21% and 37% of all GHG emissions are credited to the food system (Mbow et al., 2019 ), with meat consumption being one of the highest contributors. Meat, and beef in particular, has one of the least efficient calorie conversions of feed to food (Poore & Nemecek, 2018 ), and to achieve responsible consumption and production of such a highly inefficient food product, a substantial dietary shift and technological innovations are required mainly in the Western world (Marinova & Bogueva, 2022; Willett et al., 2019 ). Adding to the scale of the problem is the amount of food (one-third) lost or wasted (Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, 2017 ). Plant-based meat analogs can be a possible solution for achieving SDG 12 as they have a smaller environmental footprint. For example, according to Beyond Meat, plant-based meat analogs use 72%–99% less water than livestock-derived meat (Heller & Keoleian, 2018 ). A review by Bryant (2022)  found that around 90% of the consumers of plant-based meat and dairy are meat-eaters or flexitarians. Although flexitarians are contributing to SDG 12, they aim to reduce their consumption of animal products but do not eliminate them entirely. Instead, they make a conscious effort to incorporate more plant-based foods into their diets while still allowing themselves some flexibility to consume animal products in moderation.  22.7.4 SDG 13: Climate action Agriculture is the key to responding to climate change (Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, 2017 ). Research shows that plant-based meat products cause lower levels of GHG emissions than the animal products they replace. Plant-based meat analogs emit 30%–90% less GHG emissions than livestock-derived meat (The Good Food Institute, 2019 ). Compared to beef burgers, plant-based burgers are associated with up to 98% less GHG emissions (Bryant, 2022 ). The reduction is predominantly due to cutting down the more powerful methane gas (84 times more powerful than carbon dioxide, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2015 ) associated with enteric fermentation in ruminant animals, as well as decreasing the need for fertilizers to grow feed and consequently less formation of nitrous oxide (265 times more powerful than carbon dioxide according to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2015 ) in the atmosphere. A life cycle analysis (LCA) of some of the popular plant-based meat analogs, such as Beyond Burger and the Impossible Burger, reveals a reduced carbon footprint compared to the American-raised beef fed with mixed rations in feedlots (Heller & Keoleian, 2018 ; Khan et al., 2019 ). In the case of the Impossible Burger, there is an 89% reduction in the global warming potential of the product compared to the beef burger (Khan et al., 2019 ). Detzel et al. (2022)  show that in certain conditions, extruded plant-based meat substitutes could have a very similar carbon footprint to that of chicken meat, which is 10 times lower than that of  beef (Ritchie, 2020 ). Generally, plant-based ingredients generate 10–50 times less GHG emissions than animal products (Ritchie, 2020 ); however, processing, transport, packaging, storage, and retailing add to their carbon footprint. Plant-based meat analogs are considered a potentially important climate solution. Plant-based meat analogs could respond to concerns about the effects of animal-based food, and particularly red meat, on climate change. Combined with flexitarianism, they can be seen as a dietary transition toward more plant-rich diets, specifically needed in Western societies, and decreased environmentally unsustainable consumption (Whitton et al., 2021; Graça et al., 2019 ).  22.7.5 SDG 15: Life on land The demand for land of plant-based meat analogs is much lower than their livestock-derived counterparts. In the case of the Impossible Burger, it requires 96% less land and also contributes 92% less aquatic pollutants (Khan et al., 2019), which ultimately affect life below water (SDG 14). The range of ingredients used in plant-based substitutes includes cereals (e.g., wheat and oat), pseudocereals (e.g., chia and quinoa), legumes (e.g., soybeans, lentils, and peas), and mixtures of those (Smetana et al., 2023 ). They all have lower demands for land, and legumes in particular help restore soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. A shift to flexitarianism decreases the demand for meat. Reducing the demand for land for grazing and growing feed for livestock then can free up space for native vegetation and habitat restoration. Plant-based agriculture also allows for innovative ways of growing the analog ingredients, including vertical farming, aeroponics, and hydroponics, all of which reduce the pressure on land use. Reforesting and rewilding large areas would have many additional benefits, including storing carbon and supporting biodiversity (Maslin, 2022 ).  22.7.6 SDG 6: Clean water and sanitation Sustainable agriculture holds the potential to address water scarcity (Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, 2017 ). Currently, livestock agriculture consumes almost a third of the water used in global agriculture (Lamb et al., 2016 ), with 99.8% of this water employed for forage crop cultivation. This water use drains aquifers and spring sources that otherwise could be used for drinking water, or waste rainwater that could be used to grow food for direct human consumption (Lamb et al., 2016 ). Livestock farming is one of the main causes of eutrophication due to the excess use of agricultural fertilizers, direct sewage discharge, and the manure animals produce (Herrero et al., 2015 ). This also creates direct human health risks. Furthermore, there are the risks overly associated with massive amounts of untreated animal waste and the overuse of antibiotics in agriculture, which leads to the emergence of a silent pandemic of antimicrobial resistance (Bogueva & Marinova, 2023 ). Plant-based meat requires a fraction of the cropland and less  fertilizers, produces no manure, and there is no need for any antibiotics. It causes 51%–91% less aquatic nutrient pollution than conventional livestock-derived meat (The Good Food Institute, 2019 ). Encouraging a flexitarian approach with plant-based meat analogs also contributes to the reduction of water used directly by farm animals and their processing.  22.7.7 SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy Modern food systems are heavily dependent on fossil fuels (Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, 2017 ). For many plant-based products, information regarding their energy use is not available. Despite the lack of data, it is clear that creating plant-based meat analogs involves building an equivalent to the livestock-derived product from plant-based ingredients. The content of the plant-based meat alternatives is 50%–80% water, 4%–20% nontextured based protein, 10%–25% vegetable-texture-based proteins, 3%–10% additives for flavor enhancement, 0%–5% coloring agents, 0%–15% fats, and 1%–15% binding agents (Ahmad et al., 2022 ). The producers’ starting point is choosing the plant protein, mostly soy, pea, wheat, potato, oat, or other plant proteins, and then adding thoroughly selected ingredients to simulate meat-like qualities, taste, texture, flavor, appearance, and so on. Most meat analogs contain coconut oil to resemble the mouthfeel of animal fats, carrageenan for thickening, yeast extract or other flavorings to add meaty flavors, and a plant-derived version of heme iron to imitate animal blood. The majority of existing LCAs of plant-based meat analogs, showing their energy and other environmental parameters, are commissioned by the companies that produce the alternative products (Heller & Keoleian, 2018 ; Khan et al., 2019 ). Independent assessments are needed to have a good understanding of the volume and sources of the energy used.  22.7.8 SDG 8: Good jobs and economic growth Although the plant-based meat analogs sector is still relatively new, there is already evidence that it is likely to generate good job opportunities and contribute to economic growth with reduced pressure on natural resources compared to livestock-derived products. According to the survey conducted in Brazil, the United States and Europe (Morais-da-Silva et al., 2022 , p. 12), these new jobs are to require higher skills as well as appropriate policies and strategies “as the new post-animal bioeconomy unfolds.”  22.7.9 SDG 9: Industry, innovation, and infrastructure The plant-based analogs are also part of the emerging new Seventh Technological Wave focused on human health, clever food production, artificial intelligence, and regeneration of the planet’s ecology (Marinova & Bogueva, 2022 ).   22.7.10 SDG 16: Peace justice and strong institutions Ending hunger (part of SDG 2) can be a drastic factor in achieving peace and stability (Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, 2017 ). Plant-based meat analogs have the potential to contribute to ending hunger, but many factors require to be improved or put in place, such as food safety and nutrition quality controls, availability and affordability, and price parity with livestock-based meat; they all require adequate policies and strong institutions. The issue of labeling plant-based meat analogs to send the appropriate information to consumers is also of interest. While the meat and livestock lobby across the world wants to preserve the use of certain words, including “meat,” for animal-derived products, research from the UK shows that “not using meat-related labels on vegetarian dishes likely decreases the appeal of meat alternatives, and consequently that banning those labels may weaken the ongoing global efforts to reduce meat consumption consumers prefer meat” (Marshall et al., 2022 ).  22.7.11 SDG 17: Partnerships for the goals Through partnerships among industries, research organizations, and the broader society, plant-based meat analogs can play a role in shifting the protein transition toward more plant-rich diets and making our food systems more sustainable. Partnerships help raise the voice of the hungry (Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, 2017 ), who are suffering from the misappropriation of the global resources. Currently, livestock uses 80% of the global agricultural land and its precious resources, such as soil and biodiversity, to produce less than 20% of the food calories (Ritchie, 2017 ). Following the flexitarian approach, plant-based meat analogs could be a solution to world hunger, undernourishment, and malnourishment, as well as other pressing SDGs; however, they should constantly be improved by working together in partnerships across nations and internationally. These partnerships can also address problems related to waste generation, soil, water, and land pollution, packaging, storage, distribution channels, and distorted markets.   22.8 Conclusion The plant-based meat alternatives have become a booming area of innovation, offering diversity and choice to consumers who are health-conscious or concerned about issues related to animal welfare or ecological well-being. There is, however, a need to clarify the potential trade-offs and synergies between the environmental impact and nutritional properties of these meat substitutes (Smetana et al., 2023 ). Promoting flexitarian approaches with plant-based meat analogs can help to address many of the UN SDGs in a sustainability transition  by contributing toward reduction in GHG emissions, improved public health, and sustainable and responsible consumption and production. The journey of making our food systems and dietary choices more sustainable has begun, and the flexitarian approaches with plant-based meat analogs are part of the road toward living more sustainably.
