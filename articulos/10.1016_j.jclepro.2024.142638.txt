                  With less than 6 years left to achieve the global sustainable development goals (SDGs) by 2030, there is a growing urgency to increase the effectiveness of policy actions by targeting multiple SDGs. Mathematical modeling tools facilitate sustainability assessment in support of integrated policymaking. This study examines the interlinkages between the SDGs with commonly used and broadly applicable energy system models (ESMs) using the 248 indicators defined by the United Nations. The SDGs are classified under the environment (SDGs 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15), economy (SDGs 8, 9, 10, 11, 17), and society (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 16) domains governing the sustainability framework. The results ascertain that current ESMs are conceived to prioritize energy-related environmental indicators related to SDG7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG13 (Climate Action) with limited focus on non-energy indicators of the environmental domain, along with little to no coverage of SDGs-indicators allocated within the economic and social domains, respectively. The findings call for expanding the frontiers of ESMs to incorporate emerging systemic interdependencies that extend beyond the traditional “energy-environmental” nexus considering the multi-dimensional facets of sustainable development. For this purpose, a conceptual integrated framework was developed underscoring procedural protocols and technical directives to advance the ESMs-SDGs modeling paradigm through the application of methodological improvement opportunities. Theoretical and practical implications driven by policy and managerial perspectives were also discussed. In closure, this study can inform stakeholders about the gaps (sustainability issues and corresponding targets-indicators) that are imperative to address in modeling the SDGs and how to leverage existing ESMs into integrating a broader range of SDGs beyond traditional considerations. The improved outcomes are expected to facilitate integrated sustainable policy planning and formulation in pursuit of operationalizing the SDGs for the timely attainment of the 2030 agenda.

Several classifications of the SDGs across the EES domains are evident in the literature (Kostoska and Kocarev, 2019; Fonseca and Carvalho, 2019; Vinuesa et al., 2020; D'Adamo et al., 2021; Palomares et al., 2021; Barta et al., 2023; Fang et al., 2023) with no universally adopted standard or common definition. In this context, the SDGs are categorized rather intuitively based on the prevalence of the SDGs-indicators in each of the EES domains forming the sustainability framework depicted in Fig. 2. However, certain SDGs have indicators that may also belong to other domains, and thus the given classification is by no means a rigid or formal proposition. Marking beyond halfway till the 2030 agenda, several studies emphasized the urgent need to advance the SDGs, particularly in light of recent setbacks witnessed through events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russian-Ukrainian invasion, and the Israel-Gaza war, which slow down global progress towards the SDGs (United Nations, 2022; Leal Filho et al., 2023). In fact, Richardson et al. (2023) revealed that six of nine planetary boundaries are transgressed indicating that Earth is now well outside the safe operating space for humanity.These outcomes also support the realization of other global agendas in the context of the UN including the Paris Agreement considering the short-term vision for the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) centering around 2030, and the long-term vision for the net zero emissions (NZE) agenda by mid-century. The analysis provides a useful framework to design and evaluate specific adaptation-mitigation interventions in energy systems to achieve SD such as the adoption of clean production technologies for improving environmental sustainability conjugate with other socio-economic measures. The intertwined nature of the SDGs with NZE underscores a promising avenue for future research to leverage ESMs into driving parallel progress towards achieving the overarching objectives of both global agendas, as the success of the former drives the achievement of the latter (Clarke et al., 2022). The UN has recently emphasized seeking win-win synergies that tackle climate and SD crises together to keep the 1.5\u00B0C goal in reach while ensuring the SDGs are on track (United Nations, 2023).Special thanks are extended to Khalifa University for its support to the PhD programs in Engineering.

Handling Editor: Giovanni Baiocchi With less than 6 years left to achieve the global sustainable development goals (SDGs) by 2030, there is a growing urgency to increase the effectiveness of policy actions by targeting multiple SDGs. Mathematical modeling tools facilitate sustainability assessment in support of integrated policymaking. This study examines the interlinkages between the SDGs with commonly used and broadly applicable energy system models (ESMs) using the 248 indicators defined by the United Nations. The SDGs are classified under the environment (SDGs 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15), economy (SDGs 8, 9, 10, 11, 17), and society (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 16) domains governing the sustainability framework. The results ascertain that current ESMs are conceived to prioritize energy-related environmental indicators related to SDG7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG13 (Climate Action) with limited focus on non-energy indicators of the environmental domain, along with little to no coverage of SDGs-indicators allocated within the economic and social domains, respectively. The findings call for expanding the frontiers of ESMs to incorporate emerging systemic interdependencies that extend beyond the traditional “energy-environmental” nexus considering the multi-dimensional facets of sustainable development. For this purpose, a conceptual integrated framework was developed underscoring procedural protocols and technical directives to advance the ESMs-SDGs modeling paradigm through the application of methodological improvement opportunities. Theoretical and practical implications driven by policy and managerial perspectives were also discussed. In closure, this study can inform stakeholders about the gaps (sustainability issues and corresponding targets-indicators) that are imperative to address in modeling the SDGs and how to leverage existing ESMs into integrating a broader range of SDGs beyond traditional considerations. The improved outcomes are expected to facilitate integrated sustainable policy planning and formulation in pursuit of operationalizing the SDGs for the timely attainment of the 2030 agenda.

They are decision support tools that create simplified images of real-life applications in an organized model structure to examine the behavior of parts or an entire system under specific conditions such as the presence or absence of policy (Farzaneh, 2019 ). Initially, these modeling tools focused on energy crises triggered by the first oil embargo in 1973, but gradually shifted towards developing strategies for the abatement of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with the rise of the climate change issue from the 1990s and onwards (Huntington, 2021 ). In 2016, the sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations (UN) were enacted to promote sustainability by 2030 to satisfy people's present needs while safeguarding the ability of future generations to meet their own (United Nations, 2015 ). These are 17 global goals umbrella to 169 targets and 248 measurement indicators defined as per the UN Global Indicator Framework (United Nations Statistics Division, 2021 ) (Fig. 1  ). The SDGs support sustainability under three governing pillars related to Environment, Economy, and Society (EES ). Several classifications of the SDGs across the EES domains are evident in the literature (Kostoska and Kocarev, 2019 ; Fonseca and Carvalho, 2019 ; Vinuesa et al., 2020 ; D'Adamo et al., 2021 ; Palomares et al., 2021 ; Barta et al., 2023 ; Fang et al., 2023 ) with no universally adopted standard or common definition. In this context, the SDGs are categorized rather intuitively based on the prevalence of the SDGs-indicators in each of the EES domains forming the sustainability framework depicted in Fig. 2  . However, certain SDGs have indicators that may also belong to other domains, and thus the given classification is by no means a rigid or formal proposition. Marking beyond halfway till the 2030 agenda, several studies emphasized the urgent need to advance the SDGs, particularly in light of recent setbacks witnessed through events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russian-Ukrainian invasion, and the Israel-Gaza war, which slow down global progress towards the SDGs (United Nations, 2022 ; Leal Filho et al., 2023 ). In fact, Richardson et al. (2023)  revealed that six of nine planetary boundaries are transgressed indicating that Earth is now well outside the safe operating space for humanity. Amid rapidly approaching deadlines, modeling capabilities have further evolved towards incorporating the broader concept of sustainable development (SD). In particular, advancements in computing power and the availability of electronic data sources revolutionized the modeling process, transforming relatively simple models into highly complex archetypes with richer details (Huntington, 2021 ). This rapid proliferation of modeling tools lead to a surge in ESMs which mainly come in three common forms: hybrid, bottom-up, or top-down analytical approaches. The analytical approach involves breaking a system into fundamental elements to understand the type of interactions that exist between them (Nakata et al., 2011 ; Fattahi et al., 2020 ). Hybrid modeling frameworks, namely the Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), focus on the interaction between the EES domains (Shukla et al., 2022 ). Different IAMs couple the EES domains to different degrees and thus the extent of the SDGs representation across them varies considerably. Indeed, some modeling frameworks started to incorporate socio-economic aspects instead of only focusing on the environmental dimension. However, integration remains limited with only few extending beyond this scope particularly as the number of existing IAMs is limited relative to the other types of ESMs. Other types of ESMs encompass bottom-up techniques which primarily focus on technical engineering aspects or top-down techniques with macro-economic methodologies. Nevertheless, these modeling frameworks hold structures that can readily incorporate a multitude of EES factors related to the SDGs (Niet et al., 2021 ). Models that fail to capture the various and broader interactions envisioned within the SDGs will likely fall short in replicating the dynamic complexities of real-world applications leading to the formulation of inefficient, siloed policies.  1.2 Literature review Within the context of SD, the majority of the reported literature examines the interlinkages among the SDGs (Pradhan et al., 2017 ; Kostetckaia and Hametner, 2022 ; Cling and Delecourt, 2022 ; Song and Jang, 2023 ). Others examined the interlinkages between climate change mitigation measures relevant to the main sectors of the energy system and the SDGs by mapping synergies and trade-offs (Dagnachew et al., 2021 ). However, the definition of the relationship between the ESMs and SDGs remains lacking with only limited efforts examining the SDGs in the context of modeling tools. In particular, Allen et al. (2016)  conducted a comparative assessment of eight models to examine their relevance for national SDGs planning based on a predetermined typology of modeling attributes, while Aly et al. (2022)  examined nine modeling techniques and identified how well they align with sustainability science priorities related to the SDGs. Meanwhile, Niet et al. (2021)  examined the importance and ease of incorporating aspects of the SDGs into three types of modeling frameworks. Earlier, Pollitt et al. (2010)  explored the links between macro-economic perspectives and SD by reviewing their representation in sixty models applying economic principles. A notable observation across the reported studies is the predominant emphasis on examining the SDGs in the context of modeling tools through selected thematic policy areas relevant to SD, or certain predefined criteria or typology related to model attributes and characteristics that are seemingly important for modeling the SDGs. More recently, one study examined how well a selected set of twelve IAMs cover SDGs primarily at goals (macro-) or targets (meso-) level (van Soest et al., 2019 ), while the closest to a comprehensive analysis is provided by (Barbero Vignola et al., 2020a , 2020b ) through the mapping of 108 modeling tools against the SDGs based on how well the model outputs contribute to the targets/indicators. However, the latter evaluates only tools that are in-house to the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission and may not be necessarily accessible or used by external users. Also, some of the assessed tools are toolboxes or platforms, while the rest are models – some are physical, biological, or statistical – not directly relevant to energy systems but rather focus on specific areas like finance, maritime affairs, fisheries, and agriculture. Additionally, most of these models are calibrated to the European region restricting insights to the European policymaking context. Overall, the work simply reports the results of the mapping exercise without addressing methodological recommendations, concluding with a suggestion for future advancement towards an integrated framework for utilizing models in achieving SDGs as the next step forward. As such, reported efforts remain limited at best, leaving much to be desired in exploring improvement opportunities (IOs) for commonly used and broadly applicable ESMs to fully utilize the capabilities of these models in unlocking integrated sustainable policies.  1.3 Research questions This study aims to develop an integrated framework for improving modeling paradigms into devising integrated sustainable policies, informed by the outcomes of an in-depth examination of SDGs coverage across various types of ESMs to fill the identified knowledge gaps. Therefore, the study is guided by the following research questions:1. To what extent are the SDGs-indicators represented in commonly used and broadly applicable ESMs?  2. What prospects can expand the integration of SDGs into ESMs to leverage their capabilities?    In response to these questions, a systematic mapping analysis was conducted to identify SDGs interlinkages with commonly used and broadly applicable ESMs using the 248 SDGs-indicators (micro-level) defined by the UN, to examine the extent to which these modeling tools integrate the SDGs. This study presents an in-depth analysis scrutinizing case study applications employing ESMs across 65 distinct geographical scopes (global, regional, national, and sub-national scales). Based on insights from the comparative analysis, a conceptual ESMs-SDGs integrated framework was developed underscoring methodological IOs to expand the SDGs integration across various types of ESMs. The framework demonstrates a preparatory guideline with advanced procedural protocols and technical directives for modeling practices to accelerate integrated sustainable policy planning and formulation in pursuit of the 2030 agenda.   2 Methodology The degree of representation of the SDGs in ESMs was examined through a systematic approach (Fig. 3  ) encompassing the selection of appropriate ESMs (Step 1), followed by a review and synthesis of relevant literature (Step 2) along with the extraction of pertinent keywords (Step 3), to reach closure through an interlinkages mapping analysis (Step 4) that enables the definition of key improvements. 2.1 ESMs selection process The existing variation and abundance of ESMs pose challenges in selecting the most appropriate models to use. A broad suite of 841 distinct ESMs was initially surveyed drawing upon data collected from papers spanning from 1999 to 2023 (Supplementary Material – Appendix A ). The search for papers was conducted across multiple databases namely Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct using a specific string of keywords – “energy system(s) model(s)” OR “energy system(s) modeling” OR “energy system(s) modeling” OR “energy model(s)”, OR “system(s) model(s)”. Google Scholar was used for final verification to ensure the inclusion of all relevant papers that may have been missed from prior search. Additional ESMs were also identified from various open access repositories.1  1 Open Energy Modelling Initiative, 2023 ; Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium, 2023 ; European Climate and Energy Modelling Forum, 2023 ; Energy Modelling Initiative, 2023 ; Energy Modelling Hub, 2023 ; Open Energy Platform, 2023 ; Modelling Inventory and Knowledge Management System of the European Commission, 2023 ; Modelling Tools to Assess the Impact of the Implementation of Response Measures, 2023    The resulting comprehensive record encompasses different types of modeling tools with relevant applications in energy systems. Four inclusion-exclusion criteria were adopted to screen and narrow down the final selection of ESMs (Fig. 3 –  Step 1). Criteria 1 – “Lack of Information”:  Excluded models that lack publicly available information including technical documentation, an official website, or supporting references that could aid in their evaluation. Criteria 2 – “Specialist Models”:  Excluded models that address a particular sector or application or domain within the broader field of energy systems. These are sector-specific (micro- or operational detail models) that focus on only one or few sectors of the energy system, or consider the demand for end-use sectors in an aggregated form based on the combined load of power consumption in all sectors with simplified technology representations. Specialist models tend to have a narrower scope as they do not fully represent cross-sectoral interactions, nor are they sufficiently rich in characterizing technologies which limits their ability to reflect the complexity of real-world systems. As such, whole system models that cover both the supply (power) and demand (residential, commercial, transport, industry, and agriculture) sectors were emphasized. A whole system perspective better captures the dynamics within and across the sectors of the energy system to best answer questions associated with the SDGs. Criteria 3 – “Territory Models”:  Excluded location-specific models developed to analyze a particular geographic area only. In particular, global-scale models with high spatial configuration were prioritized. Depending on the structural granularity, these models typically disaggregate countries as individual zones (national scale) or group them into respective regions (regional scale) based on the geographical groupings predefined by the model. These groupings commonly encompass regions like Europe, Asia, America, and the Middle East and North Africa, among others, which come in different variants depending on the model's level of detail. These models provide users the flexibility to simulate any area of choice and examine interactions between varying countries/regions, ensuring the findings apply to a broad range of contexts rather than a limited geographic scope. However, models that portray the world as a single aggregated area have been excluded due to their inability to accurately reflect regional variations, country-specific dynamics, and the heterogeneity of environmental and socio-economic related factors, potentially oversimplifying the complexity of the investigated system and overlooking critical challenges. Criteria 4 – “Threshold Publications”:  Excluded models with the least published evidence (peer-reviewed journals) from 2016 to 2023 corresponding to the period since the enactment of the SDGs (January 2016), to select up-to-date and commonly used models relevant to the field. Publications before 2016 were not “specifically” intended for nor targeted towards the SDGs and thus were considered outside the scope of this study. The publication frequency of the models was compared relative to one another to establish their prominence, and those with the least publication count were excluded.  2.2 ESMs case studies selection process The next step was to extract case study applications relevant to the shortlisted ESMs. The selected case studies were retrieved from various databases for a more homogenous sample collection. Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, and a complementary search using Google Scholar were conducted to ensure the coverage of relevant literature. The search was carried out using keywords pertaining to the model's name in both abbreviated and full forms (e.g. “GCAM” OR “Global Change Assessment Model”). Four main inclusion-exclusion criteria were used to screen and narrow down the final selection of ESMs case studies (Fig. 3 –  Step 2). Criteria 1 – “Literature (2016–2023)”:  The search was limited to case studies published between 2016 and 2023 to capture modeling developments since the enactment of the SDGs (January 2016). Criteria 2 – “English Articles”:  Only research papers were considered while other types of grey literature (e.g. conference proceedings and book chapters) were excluded including non-English articles. Criteria 3 – “Diverse Articles”:  Studies were selected to cover a wide range of topics related SD considering the EES domains, to ensure a more representative sample collection and avoid restricting interpretation boundaries for the SDGs. Criteria 4 – “Non-multimodel Analysis”:  Studies featuring multi-model analyses with multiple ESMs of comparable capabilities were excluded to discern the distinct characteristics of individual models and avoid attributing specific outputs to a particular model when multiple models are used.  2.3 Keywords selection process The SDGs-indicators are classified into three tiers (I, II and III) based on their level of methodological development and data availability at global level (Tier Classification for Global SDG Indicators, 2023 ). The UN allocates equal importance to all indicators, and thus an “equal weighting” approach was adopted where each indicator is considered equally significant (Gan et al., 2017 ). Nonetheless, a weighted sensitivity analysis was conducted to check if the order of the ESMs in terms of SDGs coverage would change when indicators with different tiers were assigned higher importance. The importance is assigned to the 248 indicators using varying weights increasing incrementally from a factor of 2–10 by one unit. Two sets of scenarios were generated, each consisting of nine trials. The first set assigns the importance weight to Tier I indicators only, while the second set allocates the weight to Tier II indicators only. Those were compared with the reference case where all indicators were equally weighted (factor of 1) irrespective of their tier classification, to verify how sensitive the resulting ESMs-SDGs interlinkages (output) are to the various types of measurement indicators (input). Moreover, countries examined in the retrieved case studies were discerned into their respective developmental status (least developed, landlocked developing, small island developing, or developed economies) as some indicators are region specific (SDG Indicators Regional Groupings Used in Report and Statistical Annex, 2023 ; World Economic Situation and Prospects 2022 ). Based on the Global Indicator Framework (United Nations Statistics Division, 2021 ), basic text and language pattern processing extracted a representative set of keywords for the SDGs targets and indicators, generating a matrix highlighting key terms/phrases pertinent to the SDGs (Supplementary Material – Appendix B ). The adopted approach follows qualitative and quantitative analyses of published evidence guided by the extracted keywords, drawing inspiration from similar methodologies (McCollum et al., 2018 ; Fuso Nerini et al., 2018 ; Vinuesa et al., 2020 ; Barbero Vignola et al., 2020a ) used to identify relationships in the SDGs context (Fig. 3 –  Step 3).  2.4 Mapping interlinkages Using the predefined set of keywords, a content analysis that scrutinizes qualitative and quantitative material (written and visual) was conducted to determine the degree of SDGs representation in ESMs. In particular, the retrieved case study applications were examined to identify explicit themes and concepts related to the keywords, as well as any evidence of outcomes for the SDGs. The assignment of the interlinkages for evaluating the extent to which ESMs address the SDGs-indicators, was allocated based on two approaches: (i) The endogenous perspective  defines a direct linkage between a particular SDG and ESM if a SDG-indicator is embedded within the mathematical formulation/framework. However, the linkage can sometimes be direct yet simplified or direct but limited. This is the case when the model does not capture the precise definition of the SDG-indicator as defined by the Global Indicator Framework but instead considers only a simplified definition or captures only certain aspects of the indicator in question (proxy indicators related to the key issues of a specific goal/target). (ii) The exogenous perspective  denotes an indirect relationship in which the analysis by the model and subsequent results interpretation derive external insights or offside analysis for policy and practical applications that feed into and support the indicator of a respective SDG. In this context, an indirect correlation does not necessarily imply a model's lack of relevance or thereof lack of capability. Rather, it signifies that the selected applications of the model derive many of the SDGs implications based on external offside analysis. Consequently, a customized scoring system was designed to determine the presence and assess the strength of interlinkages between the SDGs and the shortlisted ESMs (Table 1  ). The system assigns a score of 1 (equal weights) to each indicator (x  i   ) of the SDGs based on its level of relevance to the ESMs judged from the examined case study applications. The accumulated scores earned by each model for each goal (Y  ij   ) are calculated and then normalized by dividing them with the maximum number of indicators that can be attained per SDG (X  ij   ) to ensure the scores are comparable across ESMs. The resulting normalized score (NS  i  j  ), ranging from 0 to 1, determines whether an interlinkage exists and labels its strength accordingly (Rank  ij   ). The use of the extracted keywords systematically guided the mapping analysis to test if SDGs-indicators are directly or indirectly integrated within the shortlisted ESMs to weigh the extent of their coverage. The analysis enabled an evidence-based assessment of the sustainability performance of the selected modeling tools. A Monte Carlo simulation followed to quantify the level of variation associated with the resulting ESMs-SDGs interlinkages and rank the models based on their respective degree of uncertainty. This probabilistic technique employs random sampling running through one million iterations. In each iteration, the simulation generates a large number of random samples based on specified ranges reflecting the interlinkage scores earned by each of the SDGs. These ranges are provided for each ESM to determine the variability associated with the model results. By repeatedly sampling from the ranges and combining the scores according to predefined weights, the simulation produces a distribution of possible outcomes for the overall score representing the uncertainty associated with the interlinkages (Fig. 3 –  Step 4).   3 Results Following the selection process for the initial list of 841 modeling tools, a total of ten up-to-date commonly used and broadly applicable ESMs (Table 2  ) were shortlisted as the most fitting for the evaluation process in line with the criteria defined in Section 2.1 . With respect to the selection process for ESMs case studies as per the criteria defined in Section 2.2 , a considerable number of case studies documenting the applications of some ESMs (LEAP, TIMES and GCAM) in diverse contexts were available. For other models (particularly DNE21 and POLES), a relatively smaller number of case studies met the defined criteria, setting the selection threshold across all models for a uniform comparative analysis. As such, twenty case study applications were shortlisted for each model considering the model's core versions and respective variants. For simplicity, only the core version of the models is referred to hereafter. The selection of case studies followed a reverse chronological approach, starting with the most recent studies in 2023 and moving backwards to 2016. For some models (LEAP and TIMES), recent studies, particularly those published in 2022 and 2023, happen to cut across a variety of sustainability related subjects and thus were prioritized over older ones. Conversely, studies selected for other models spanned from 2016 to 2023 to maintain a diverse representation of thematic topics across the case study applications, while still giving preference to newer publications where appropriate. Some models (DNE21 and POLES) appeared mostly in studies that featured more than one model. Nonetheless, the final case studies for these models were selected in a manner that invariably distinguishes their results separately, allowing for a more accurate assessment of the distinct competence of each model. Accordingly, the analysis of the systematic interlinkages mapping was conducted by scrutinizing 200 case study applications employing the ten ESMs (Supplementary Material – Appendix C ) across 65 distinct geographical scopes (global, regional, national, and sub-national scales) (Fig. 4  ). China and India were the dominant areas of study by ESMs in the context of SD. The outcomes of examining the extent to which each ESM integrates the 17 SDGs considering the 248 SDGs-indicators (micro-level) are detailed in the Supplementary Material – Appendix D . The degree of variation of the SDGs interlinkages within the shortlisted ESMs is delineated in a heatmap (Fig. 5  ), with the models ranked in descending order of their cumulative scores whereby the strength of the interlinkages is defined in a five-level system (None, Weak, Moderate, Substantial, Strong). The results demonstrate the relative sustainability performance of each model based on how well they address the 248 SDGs-indicators. In particular, the analysis reveals that SDG7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) has a “strong” representation in all ESMs except for GCAM, which exhibited “substantial” coverage for this goal. This can be attributed to the model's selected case study applications which mostly examined water, agriculture, land, and climate systems rather than energy systems only. SDG12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG13 (Climate Action) follow as the next most represented with “moderate” coverage observed across the models. The remaining SDGs (17, 8, 9, 6, 15, 11, 2, 10, 3, 14, 4, and 1 in descending order) show mostly “weak” coverage across all models, while SDG5 (Gender Equality) and SDG16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions) were not targeted by any model. Fig. 6   depicts the cumulative interlinkages between the ESMs and SDGs. Among the highest ranked ESMs, notable instances of applications with a fair consideration of SDGs are exemplified by IMAGE/TIMER (van Sluisveld et al., 2016 ; van Vuuren et al., 2017 ), AIM/Enduse (Vishwanathan et al., 2021 ; Chaichaloempreecha et al., 2022 ), LEAP (Zhao et al., 2022 ; Agbossou et al., 2022 ), GCAM (Turner et al., 2019 ; Moreno et al., 2023 ), and MESSAGE (Shen et al., 2022 ; Zakeri et al., 2022 ). The extent to which the ESMs cover the targets and indicators associated with the SDGs across the EES domains has been explored (Supplementary Material – Appendix E ). The mapping analysis revealed 113 distinct targets (out of 169) and 158 indicators (out of 248) – 112 (out of 166) Tier I, 39 (out of 74) Tier II, and 7 (out of 8) Tier I/II multiple – across the ESMs (Fig. 7  ). The majority are situated in the environmental domain (47 targets and 58 indicators), followed by the economic (41 targets and 52 indicators) and social domains (25 targets and 48 indicators). The findings signify the social domain is the least addressed by ESMs in comparison to the economic domain which has a lower degree of coverage than the environmental domain. Nonetheless, there still remains substantial room for improvement within both the environmental and economic domains. For the environmental domain  (⁓55% of overall coverage), the indicators with the most extensive coverage are related to SDG7 (19%), SDG12 (18%), and SDG13 (10%), particularly access to electricity (7.1.1), clean fuels and technology (7.1.2), renewable energy generation capacity (7.2.1)(7. b.1)(12. a.1), energy efficiency (7.3.1), sustainable consumption and production (12.1.1), efficient use of natural resources (12.2.1)(12.2.2), climate change strategies (13.2.1), and GHG emissions (13.2.2). Among these, SDG7 exhibited the strongest direct interlinkage perhaps owing to the fact that it is the only goal that comprises Tier I indicators. A notable gap is the weaker coverage of non-energy environmental indicators related to SDG6 (4%), SDG15 (4%), and SDG14 (1%), respectively. For the economic domain  (⁓40% of overall coverage), the indicators with the highest coverage are associated with SDG17 (16%), SDG8 (10%), and SDG9 (7%), particularly macro-economic stability (17.13.1), sustainable policy coherency (17.14.1), funding environmental technologies (17.7.1), sustaining per capita economic growth (8.1.1), sustainable consumption and production for economic growth (8.4.1)(8.4.2), and emissions per unit of value added from resource use efficiency and clean technologies (9.4.1). Meanwhile, weaker coverage is observed for indicators related to SDG11 (5%) and SDG10 (1%), respectively. For the social domain  (⁓5% of overall coverage), low to no coverage of indicators is equally noticeable across SDG1 (1%), SDG2 (2%), SDG3 (2%), SDG4 (1%), SDG5 (0%), and SDG16 (0%). Lastly, the results obtained from the Monte Carlo simulations reveal the varying uncertainties associated with the interlinkage scores, which were in close proximity among all tested models. Meanwhile, the weighted sensitivity analysis did not yield discernible changes in the overall rankings of the ESMs for SDGs coverage across scenarios assigning importance to the indicators based on their tier classification. The findings justify assigning equal importance to the indicators, confirming an inclusive approach considering the 248 indicators concurrently is valid in assessing the SDGs coverage by ESMs.  4 Discussion 4.1 Comparative analysis Evidently, most ESMs are designed to primarily address energy-related issues (SDGs 7, 12, 13), and test the feasibility of energy technologies, implying they are relatively well suited to identify measures for energy efficiency and conservation as well as assess the impact of energy strategies on GHG emissions. Expanding the environmental scope in ESMs implies improving the integration of non-energy environmental indicators particularly those related to sustainable management of water and sanitation (SDG6), conserving the oceans, seas, and marine resources (SDG14), and protecting and restoring terrestrial ecosystems including forests, land, and biodiversity (SDG15). Meanwhile, improving the economic dimension in ESMs requires delving into topics akin to reducing inequality within and among countries including income distribution and labor share (SDG10), and building safe, inclusive, and resilient communities including sustainable urbanization and access to affordable services (SDG11). Concurrently, improving social science in ESMs entails incorporating indicators related to poverty (SDG1), food security and sustainable agriculture (SDG2), health and associated tropical diseases (SDG3), sustainable education including relevant skills and jobs (SDG4), gender equality (SDG5), and establishing accountable and transparent governance institutions to reduce corruption and discrimination at all levels (SDG16), among various others. It is imperative at the onset to recognize that by design, ESMs have traditionally targeted the environmental technical dimension and then evolved into the economic aspects of energy systems. To put things into perspective, ESMs initially focused on decoupling the energy system from specific fuel markets (such as oil and gas) to avoid crises that emerge from system dependency. Then they shifted to target mainly environmental matters with the emergence of global warming (over two decades ago) to develop climate change adaptation-mitigation strategies that reduce GHG emissions. Since long-term national policy planning and formulation are centered around least-cost solutions, economics has been recognized as a vital part of the decision-making process. Therefore, subsequent ESMs developments directed much consideration towards the economic domain despite remaining limited in comparison to the environmental dimension (Rath-Nagel and Voss, 1981 ; Huntington, 2021 ). In essence, ESMs that account for economic factors can assist decision-makers identify cost-effective strategies for sustainable transitions including resource allocation, infrastructure investments, and adoption of cleaner production technologies. Furthermore, global energy markets, including electricity and fuel, are subject to economic forces like supply and demand, price fluctuations, and competition. ESMs that incorporate economic modeling can help simulate these dynamics and their effects on energy systems to evaluate the financial implications of energy development projects considering cost-benefit analyses and life-cycle costing of various technologies and policy options. Equally important is to note the increasing awareness of the pivotal role ESMs can play in addressing broader societal challenges (Ribeiro et al., 2011 ; Nikas et al., 2020 ; Krumm et al., 2022 ; Süsser et al., 2022 ; Dioha et al., 2023 ) which are central tenets of the SDGs. For example, these modeling tools can analyze energy distribution patterns for equitable access, assess health impacts of clean energy sources and technologies, identify employment opportunities to reduce poverty and inequality, facilitate community engagement and social equity, examine the impact of behavioral and lifestyle changes, and promote environmental sustainability considering renewable energy sources and energy efficiency measures. Integrating social science into the modeling framework of ESMs aids in formulating sustainable policies favorable to people-centered energy transitions that benefit society, particularly vulnerable communities such as indigenous and marginalized groups. Overall, the analysis reveals that the existing suites of ESMs attempted to add some aspects of the SDGs into the modeling practices, but integration remains rather limited particularly for the social domain. Modeling only what is easily quantifiable without considering the multifaceted interactions envisioned within the ambit of the SDGs is likely to fall short in replicating the dynamic complexities of real-world applications. Thus, the present findings call for expanding the boundaries of energy modeling practices to integrate emerging systemic interdependencies that can fully capture other relevant aspects of SD. This implies improving the definition of the sustainability tripartite domains within ESMs by incorporating indicators related to the social (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 16) and economic (SDGs 8, 9, 10, 11, 17) dimensions, while also extending the environmental scope (SDGs 6, 14, 15) beyond the traditional goals associated with the technical “energy-environmental” domain (SDGs 7, 12, 13). In this context, the ranking of the models based on their SDGs coverage does not necessarily imply the superiority or inferiority of a model. Also, due to the current diverse suite of ESMs, the findings cannot be considered a complete representation of the entire range of capabilities that ESMs can offer regarding the SDGs. Rather, they provide a general overview of the SDGs clusters, based on corresponding indicators, that ESMs currently address highlighting areas requiring further development.  4.2 Conceptual ESMs-SDGs integrated framework The limited integration of the SDGs within ESMs necessitates methodological improvements that integrate a larger pool of the SDGs to ensure consistency with the overarching objectives of SD. Fig. 8   proposes a conceptual ESMs-SDGs integrated framework developed to advance the modeling paradigm. The proposed framework was developed based on inputs gathered from a consultation process involving a survey analysis and online discussions with twelve experts from the openmod initiative community, including modelers, developers of models, researchers, professors, and industry experts from academia, research institutions, private companies, and non-governmental organizations, to learn more about the importance of certain criteria when assessing the capabilities, characteristics, and underlying techniques of ESMs including their coverage of the SDGs. This collaborative work, combined with insights from relevant literature including Ribeiro et al. (2011) , Mirakyan and De Guio (2013) , Pfenninger et al. (2014) , Allen et al. (2016) , van Soest et al. (2019) , Nikas et al. (2020) , Hanna and Gross (2021) , Chang et al. (2021) , Aly et al. (2022) , Süsser et al. (2022) , provided a general overview and understanding of these modeling tools facilitating the development of a framework comprising three main components. First,  objectives based on user-specific needs and requirements are defined and then using an updated repository of ESMs (Table A.2, Supplementary Material – Appendix A ), a customized selection process can be applied to shortlist one or more modeling tools. The selected model can be classified according to the three types of analytical approaches adopted by ESMs. In particular, bottom-up engineering models (simulation, optimization, accounting, multi-agent, and partial equilibrium) tend to focus on the technical aspects of energy systems and thus, on their own, are initially intended to target environmental issues. Top-down models (computable general equilibrium, input-output, econometric, and system dynamic) follow an aggregated macro-economic approach with less detailed technological heterogeneity to analyze interactions across the whole economy (Nakata et al., 2011 ; Fattahi et al., 2020 ). Meanwhile, hybrid models (IAMs) combine the bottom-up and top-down characteristics with a focus on the interactions between the EES domains to varying degrees. Second,  each of these modeling techniques was matched to the sustainability domain that closely resembles their “primary” purpose. In line with Fig. 2 , bottom-up models are closely associated with the definition of the environmental domain, top-down models with the economic domain, and hybrid models can cross-cut the three domains. Nonetheless, the mapping does not necessarily imply that the model type covers all the targets/indicators of the SDGs associated with its respective domain, nor does it mean the model cannot contribute to achieving the indicators of other domains. It is rather a fairly loose observation, as each of these approaches can either directly or indirectly facilitate specific SDGs-indicators contingent on the application. Third,  advanced procedural protocols and technical directives for modeling practices to expand SDGs integration across the different types of ESMs are recommended through the application of seven distinct IOs (IO.1 to IO.7). (IO.1) Code Architecture  – The source code of ESMs contains the mathematical formulations that govern the model's behavior and the relationships among variables/parameters. Many ESMs consider a narrow set of easily quantifiable variables that are primarily or solely relevant to the “energy-environmental” domain. The scope of ESMs can be expanded by modifying the model's source code either by adding new equations or adjusting existing ones to include a broader range of variables that reflect the diverse definitions of SD. The amendment should be based on the specific description of the targeted SDGs. For example, if the objective is to include indicators related to SDG5 (Gender Equality), then the model's code can be modified to include variables related to the participation of women in the energy sector, such as the percentage of women in the workforce, gender pay gap, or income distribution. Meanwhile, SDGs related to decent living standards can be translated into the model through indicators representing for example the volume of clean water per capita (SDG6), the minimum space per capita (SDG11), or the number of electrical appliances per household (SDG7). Code modification requires an understanding of the model's architecture and underlying programming to determine the consequences of the alterations on the modeling performance and results. Testing and validation procedures ensure that changes to the model do not introduce errors when incorporating a wider array of the SDGs (e.g. sensitivity analysis, Monte Carlo analysis, stochastic programming and robust optimization (for parametric uncertainties) and modeling to generate alternatives technique (for structural uncertainties) (DeCarolis et al., 2017 ; Yue et al., 2018 )). (IO.2) Parameters Recalibration –  The SDGs can be integrated into the modeling environment by reassessing the values of relevant parameters based on exogenous assumptions built on SDGs-indicators that are not explicitly simulated but are expected to affect the modeling output. This requires careful consideration of how the newly considered indicator may impact the existing model structure and how to quantitatively reflect these impacts while updating the related input parameters. The recalibration process can be iterative, as the inclusion of new SDGs may require adjustments to previously defined parameters. Since the SDGs are highly interconnected and complex in nature, re-quantification is expected to consider synergies and trade-offs among various SDGs as addressing one goal may negatively affect others. For example, increasing renewable energy production may have positive impacts on SDG7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG13 (Climate Action), but it may also have trade-offs with SDG15 (Life on Land) if it leads to increased land use change due to infrastructural requirements for energy production. Optimization techniques as well as sensitivity, statistical network and data analyses, along with multi-criteria decision analysis and stakeholder consultations (Renaud et al., 2022 ), can help identify the optimal parameter values to define the desired SDGs-indicators into the modeling framework while minimizing trade-offs. (IO.3) Scenario Narratives –  The SDGs can be represented in ESMs through diverse narratives of prospective scenarios integrating the interplay among the EES domains in harmony with the 2030 agenda. For example, ESMs can test scenarios that promote sustainable transportation by analyzing data on population density, vehicle fleets, travel patterns, alternative fuels, and infrastructure investments to assess the impact of sustainable mobility options such as electric vehicles, modal shifts, or demand management strategies on energy/material consumption, air quality, and GHG emissions, thereby contributing mainly to SDG3 (Good Health and Well-Being), SDG9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), SDG11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG13 (Climate Action). However, initiating such storylines requires a deep understanding of the interrelationships among SDGs to ensure coherency across narrations. Engaging stakeholders or focus groups through questionnaire surveys, interviews, or workshops following standardized schemes, such as the “predictive, explorative and normative” typology by Börjeson et al. (2006)  considering the principles of the futures cone by Gall et al. (2022) , can guide the scenario design process. (IO.4) Multi-disciplinary Nexus Modeling –  The representation of the SDGs in ESMs can be expanded by drawing on theories from various disciplines to capture the interactions, feedback loops, and dependencies between the systems they represent. Multi-disciplinary nexus modeling entails the inclusion of all relevant sectors of the energy system through technical mechanisms (such as coupling technologies and cross-border interactions (Breyer, 2020 )) while simultaneously considering the interplay of SDGs-related factors (environmental, economic, social) that affect the system's performance. This can be achieved using multi-model analyses that include multiple ESMs within a single framework to compare and combine the outputs from different platforms. Alternatively, hybrid modeling techniques can be used, either as integrated frameworks or linking several models within well-defined boundaries through soft-linking (manually transferring the data from one model to another) or hard-linking (automatically transferring data) to capitalize on the strengths of different methodologies and overcome their limitations (Shukla et al., 2022 ). Both approaches allow a broader exploration of the SDGs spectrum as individual models may only capture a limited subset, particularly when numerical constraints prevent the consideration of all or a broader range of SDGs endogenously. For example, a water-energy-food nexus modeling approach can examine the impact of securing food production and water management processes such as desalination or wastewater treatment on energy requirements and efficiency, thereby contributing mainly to SDG2 (No Hunger), SDG6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG13 (Climate Action). Life cycle assessment (for environmental, economic, and social externalities) also appears as a significant method to address sustainability holistically (Barbero Vignola et al., 2020a ). However, such techniques need further model refinement and thus may require the involvement of industry experts and practitioners from multiple disciplines. At present, there are no set routines about how to build such sophisticated models leading to a wide range of practices and uncertainties, which necessitates standardizing scripted workflows, data semantics, and automated processes across interfaces (Niet et al., 2022 ). (IO.5) Structure Granularity  – The structural detail of a model is presented by the temporal scale which encompasses the model's historical base year or period, planning horizon, step length, and resolution units (yearly, seasonal time slices, hourly, or sub-hourly), along with the spatial scale which covers the geographical scope (global, regional, national, or sub-national), sectoral detail (single, multiple or whole system), and resolution units (single or multiple nodes). Higher temporal and spatial resolutions help capture finer scales and enhance the representation of various SDGs within ESMs by providing more detailed feedback on the interdependencies that underlie the dynamic behavior of the complex systems modeled. This is particularly important when mimicking systems that exhibit rapid, short-term fluctuations, where small changes can affect the system's performance significantly. For example, ESMs that capture smaller time intervals, such as hourly or sub-hourly data, can present the intermittent nature of renewable energy generation throughout the day and across different seasons allowing to assess the impact of variations on system reliability, grid stability, and backup storage mechanisms to maintain a continuous balance between supply and demand at all times. Likewise, ESMs with fine spatial resolution can better capture regional differences in resource availability, demand distribution, and infrastructure configuration and can facilitate the analysis of cross-border energy flows and geographical cooperation. Such models can also map land use patterns accurately, including croplands, pasturelands, and forests, for a comprehensive evaluation of the impacts of land use change on biodiversity, ecosystems, and food production. However, a highly granular model is data intensive as it delves into the intricacies of a system as opposed to high-level aggregated observations, necessitating access to high-quality, up-to-date, and open access databases. (IO.6) Complementary Modules  – SDGs can be incorporated into ESMs through additional modules or extensions that provide the flexibility of quantifying a broader range of indicators. The definition of the set of indicators to be quantified is based on user-specific objectives and key priorities for policy needs. Key assumptions in conjunction with the various input and output parameters of the developed model can be linked together to quantify a wide range of SDGs-indicators, or appropriate proxy indicators that address key sustainability issues of a particular goal/target. Such complementary modules enable the comparison of indicators across various regions and scenarios to facilitate a better understanding of how well energy system developments align with SD and help identify potential synergies and trade-offs. For example, growth rates of renewable energy (input) can be used to quantify SDG7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) under Indicator 7.2.1 by assessing the share of renewable energy in the energy mix. Similarly, energy efficiency improvements (input) can be used to calculate SDG12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) under indicators 12.2.1 and 12.2.2 for reduction in energy consumption per capita. Meanwhile, the estimated emissions reduction (output) can be linked to SDG13 (Climate Action) under Indicator 13.2.2 related to quantifying the total annual GHG. Santika et al. (2019)  provide a good example of methods and equations to quantify the targets/indicators for SDGs associated with energy requirements. (IO.7) Off-model Calculations –  A broad set of the SDGs-indicators can also be analyzed by carrying calculations outside the modeling environment. This involves using the outputs generated by ESMs and performing “off-model” calculations to estimate the implications on various SDGs beyond what the model directly captures. For example, a model that reports on the quantity of offshore wind power plants annually (SDG7) enables the estimation of employment opportunities such activities can generate in a region (SDG8). Health costs (SDG3) can also be estimated exogenously depending on the emissions of specific pollutants (SDG13). Therefore, this approach necessitates output discussion and exogenous interpretation of the modeling results providing a flexible means of analyzing SDGs that ESMs may not directly capture.  4.3 Bridging theory and practice for SDGs operationalization 4.3.1 Theoretical implications The study findings are consistent with Allen et al. (2016)  who reported that SDGs 8, 13, 7, 17, 9, 2, 6, and 12 had the highest coverage across eight modeling tools, with moderate coverage for SDGs 10, 15, 1, 3, 11, 4, and 14 and low coverage for SDGs 5 and 16. The findings equally support arguments advanced by Pollitt et al. (2010)  who observed that two out of ten sustainability themes, namely social inclusion and governance, were least covered across sixty integrated assessment tools. Similarly, van Soest et al. (2019)  noted that SDGs 7, 9, and 13 are well-represented in twelve IAMs, while SDGs 2, 3, 8, 11, 12, 6, 15, 1, 4, and 17 are only partially quantifiable and SDGs 5, 10, 14, and 16 are inadequately covered. The results also align with Barbero Vignola et al. (2020a)  who concluded that SDGs 7, 11, 12 and 13 are the most covered across 108 tools, while SDGs 4, 5 and 16 are the least represented. This study complements the latter by delving further into the depth of the indicators (micro-) level to uncover which targets/indicators exactly contribute to the coverage of certain SDGs across commonly used and broadly applicable ESMs, and where gaps still persist across these ESMs to ultimately develop the integrated framework as a solution. In particular, the study offers valuable insights that contribute to the academic field. Firstly, the results facilitate a better understanding of the current status of commonly used and broadly applicable ESMs with respect to the broader concept of SD by revealing the extent to which these models represent the SDGs based on their coverage of the 248 indicators. By delving into the micro-level depth, the study unveils the indicators that are most to least addressed by modeling tools shedding light on the specific sustainability-related issues and corresponding targets-indicators requiring more attention and consideration in future research and dialogues. Furthermore, the study adopts a new systematic approach that evaluates inputs and outputs from the examined models while considering their mathematical techniques, based on qualitative and quantitative content analysis using extracted keywords pertinent to the definition of the SDGs. This evidence-based methodology enabled an assessment of the sustainability performance of the selected modeling tools laying the groundwork for future work to expand upon and refine. In addition, the present findings and proposed framework emphasize the need for future efforts to capitalize on already existing modeling tools to fully tap the potential of ESMs in order to synchronize energy research within the broader scope of SD. This is imperative given the presence of emerging global agendas with holistic and multidimensional views on human development, coupled with computational advances which necessitate enhancing modeling capabilities. Therefore, relevant stakeholders can use the framework to build upon and strengthen existing ESMs, thus avoiding repetition in methodologies and modeling tools development. Particularly, the framework can guide researchers and modelers into advancing modeling practices beyond traditional technical considerations by integrating a wider spectrum of the SDGs through the application of the recommended IOs. These outcomes also support the realization of other global agendas in the context of the UN  including the Paris Agreement considering the short-term vision for the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) centering around 2030, and the long-term vision for the net zero emissions (NZE) agenda by mid-century. The analysis provides a useful framework to design and evaluate specific adaptation-mitigation interventions in energy systems to achieve SD such as the adoption of clean production technologies for improving environmental sustainability conjugate with other socio-economic measures. The intertwined nature of the SDGs with NZE underscores a promising avenue for future research to leverage ESMs into driving parallel progress towards achieving the overarching objectives of both global agendas, as the success of the former drives the achievement of the latter (Clarke et al., 2022 ). The UN has recently emphasized seeking win-win synergies that tackle climate and SD crises together to keep the 1.5°C goal in reach while ensuring the SDGs are on track (United Nations, 2023 ).  4.3.2 Policy implications When considering holistically the range of actions needed for improving SDGs modeling, it is equally important to also consider the variety of policy instruments governments can employ to meaningfully translate the desired changes from theory to practice. The viable transition speed towards the global 2030 agenda depends on how well national policies can support the SDGs. Evaluations by ESMs can facilitate the process of communicating with policymaking (Huntington, 2021 ), owing to their capability to unlock momentous integrated policy reforms. This argument emphasizes the strength of ESMs in holding structures that can readily incorporate a multitude of environmental, economic, and social factors related to the SDGs-indicators (e.g. technological, geophysical, ecological, financial, industrial, cultural, legal, political, and institutional factors). Therefore, when a certain weakness is identified, it is more in the context of how ESMs can be leveraged for further benefit in policymaking for practical applications. The outcomes of the interlinkages mapping analysis, in tandem with the proposed framework, provide germane contributions to policymakers to guide real-world systems towards implementing the SDGs. By applying the recommended IOs to enhance the representation of SDGs in ESMs, the insights derived from the advanced modeling paradigms will assist in the development of public policies better aligned with the broader definition of SD (particularly for societal issues), replacing conventional siloed energy-environmental policy objectives. This will revolutionize existing governance structures towards more informed and effective practical regimes which can translate into various types of cross-sectoral policy instruments, such as command and control, market-based, informational, and negotiated agreements (Cocklin et al., 2007 ). Fig. 9   presents policy levers ranging from formalized legislation to informal grassroots initiatives to achieve the SDGs in operational settings (Sachs et al., 2019 ; Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 2020 ). Environmental instruments promote the adoption of cleaner production technologies and energy efficiency measures such as renewable energy, energy storage units, carbon pricing mechanisms, water treatment systems, and waste management among various others, for emissions abatement towards improving environmental sustainability. Meanwhile, economic instruments focus on resource allocation and productivity along with marketplace competition for financial prosperity considering labor rights, research and development, trade agreements, and joint ventures, along with many others. The social instruments prioritize equity and inclusion of civil society through, for example, community engagement, social protection systems, and changes in cultural norms and behaviors. Multiple instruments are particularly relevant when multiple SDGs are to be tackled on ground (Taylor et al., 2012 ). Therefore, the thrust of change required given the remaining timeline implies no single policy instrument alone will suffice. Instead, a whole portfolio of instruments is needed to bring about a successful complex multi-sectoral transformation. Various levels of government involvement are required to mix and tune appropriate policy instruments for propelling the transition speed. Because timing plays a particularly important role in the development of policy packages, governments will need to promote more successful vertical and horizontal policy coordination (United Nations Development Programme, 2017 ; Meuleman, 2021 ). Along these axes, governments may have to define interim targets given the tight deadline till the 2030 window. This implies policymakers, with the support of relevant practitioners such as energy planners, will have a fundamental role in rolling out these instruments in real life to tackle major roadblocks in a fragmented world with social differences and inequities. Specifically, an important practical implication is that sustainability policy adjustments should consider the perspectives of society when planning the role of policies in the transition towards SDGs including indigenous and vulnerable communities which markedly suffer different circumstances, unique challenges, and distinct needs. This ensures that designed policy actions support people-centered sustainable transitions and that successive benefits are equitably shared. A fair share of attention is given to economies in transition, such as China and India, as demonstrated by the examined case studies (Fig. 4 ). However, serious consideration to devise policies (thus practical applications) guided by SD principles should be equally directed towards more fragile and conflicted geographical regions such as the Middle East that suffers from ongoing political conflicts and persistent tensions, and the sub-Saharan African countries which have been projected to not achieve in 2030 any of the six human development SDGs explored by Moyer and Hedden (2020) . SD is a universal vision and negative (or slow) progress in one region will collectively impact global progress towards realizing the 2030 agenda. International diplomacy for regional and global cooperation is a key instrument in the policy arena and has been emphasized across multiple SDGs targets and indicators. Economically advanced and politically stable governments can assist vulnerable and low-income countries through financial aid, technology transfer, and capacity building, among other forms of support. As a result, the application of the given policy levers enables governments and policymakers to plan and formulate integrated sustainable policies in pursuit of operationalizing the 17 SDGs and overcoming loopholes that may hinder the desired progress. Nevertheless, successfully achieving SD requires further understanding of the nature of interlinkages (desirable correlations or conflicting priorities) among the SDGs, where modeling tools can provide a concrete contribution to this effect (Barbero Vignola et al., 2020a ). Therefore, policymaking should account for the possible SDGs synergies and trade-offs to pinpoint priority areas for complementary policy actions by pursuing a balanced set of SDGs necessary for the success of the global 2030 agenda. In other words, unlocking the full potential of the 2030 agenda for SD involves maximizing synergies while minimizing trade-offs among the SDGs. In this context, Biggeri et al. (2019)  developed an integrated index that can capture synergies and trade-offs among SDGs across the EES domains, to replace indices based on arithmetic mean that assumes perfect substitution between all indicators within a goal as well as across different goals without accounting for positive or negative relations. Other studies confirmed the existence of significant correlations between SDG7 and other SDGs (1, 2, 3, 8 and 13) (United Nations, 2019 ; Fonseca et al., 2020 ), with positive interactions outweighing negative ones at times (McCollum et al., 2018 ; Fuso Nerini et al., 2018 ). Meanwhile, SDG12 emerges as the goal mostly associated with trade-offs according to Pradhan et al. (2017)  and Fonseca et al. (2020) . Kroll et al. (2019)  identified notable synergies for SDGs 1, 3, 7, 8 and 9 forming the basis upon which many of the other SDGs can be achieved while recognizing trade-offs for SDGs 11, 13, 14, 16 and 17 with other goals. Accounting for the heterogeneity and interactions among the SDGs enhances coordinated policy interventions that accelerate progress towards the 2030 agenda under rapidly approaching deadlines. Consequently, a silo approach to policy-making, as applied in many countries, is not suitable as a mechanism for effecting systemic change (McCollum et al., 2018 ). Policymakers should no longer formulate energy strategies solely based on assumptions within the energy sector to achieve mainly environmental related SDGs, but rather integrate the additional requirements necessary for accomplishing other SDGs (Santika et al., 2019 ). The shift to effective policy governance requires a participatory approach with proactive collaboration between various actors (Gasper, 2019 ), to link those engaged in energy planning and management with stakeholders from diverse scientific disciplines related to SD. Stakeholder coalitions constituting transdisciplinary projects, knowledge/data exchange platforms, campaigns, workshops, and online forums can be formed to engage governments (from global to regional to national to local levels) with businesses and community groups.  4.3.3 Managerial implications Zooming in at levels below governments, this study also provides important insights for entrepreneurs and business managers. While traditional business approaches have long pursued economic activity often at the expense of the environment and society which are fundamental principles of the SDGs (Sullivan et al., 2018 ), the present findings gear towards an equal and balanced consideration of the three sustainability dimensions. This necessitates the development of new and innovative sustainable business models through corporate involvement, with the active participation of stakeholders such as public institutions, private companies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), start-ups or small businesses. The challenge lies in transitioning the SDGs from the international realm of the UN to the national jurisdiction of individual governments into the diverse landscape of businesses (Sullivan et al., 2018 ). Recent studies revealed that corporate SDGs involvement is still limited, with companies primarily engaging in symbolic self-reporting rather than taking substantive actions, perhaps to maintain reputation and competitiveness only (van der Waal and Thijssens, 2020 ; Song et al., 2022 ). To improve business internal processes and value chains, relevant stakeholders can adopt international standards that match their commercial activity to help shape their strategic plans and benchmark their operations against global best practices for quality assurance and management. For example, the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) standards for sustainability provide practical tools for all three dimensions (EES) of SD. These standards present an extensive guide on how to incorporate various elements of the SDGs into localized systems of varying scales for the mutual advantage of government, industry, and consumers. Fig. 10   demonstrates specific ISO-related tools that can be used by corporates to contribute towards meeting the SDGs (ISO - Sustainable Development Goals, 2018) . Other examples of relevant standards and guiding principles that target varying aspects of sustainability and are applicable to enterprises include the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative), SBTi (Science Based Targets initiative), CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project), SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board), UNGC (United Nations Global Compact) and TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures). Performance measurement metrics for tracking progress, along with SDGs disclosure, are advised to facilitate continual monitoring and improvement in business contexts (Schramade, 2017 ; Mio et al., 2020 ). Although the UN has explicitly urged businesses to contribute to the SDGs (SDG Compass Guide, 2020 ), limited knowledge remains of the extent to which the business sector has engaged with the SDGs (Song et al., 2022 ). With less than six years till 2030, further research on the strategic role of businesses in tackling SDGs is imperative to understand how corporations can advance business-as-usual into SD-aligned practices. In parallel, various policy instruments can be leveraged to incentivize businesses to comply with international standards and best practices for the SDGs.    5 Conclusion Overall, this study exposed the extent to which ESMs as decision support tools can facilitate tangible progress in the pursuit of the SDGs for the 2030 agenda. In response to the first research question (“To what extent are the SDGs-indicators represented in commonly used and broadly applicable ESMs?‎‎”) , a systematic interlinkages mapping analysis was conducted between the SDGs and a selected suite of commonly used and broadly applicable ESMs based on how well they cover the 248 indicators (micro-level) that monitor their implementation and global progress towards the 2030 agenda. The analysis involved examining case study applications employing ESMs across 65 distinct geographical scopes including global, regional, national, and sub-national scales. The results revealed that current ESMs prioritize the environmental domain with a pronounced emphasis on energy-related indicators for SDG7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), trailed by SDG12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG13 (Climate Action), with less coverage for non-energy related indicators pertaining to SDG6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG14 (Life Below Water), and SDG15 (Life on Land). The indicators of the economic domain exhibit a lower degree of coverage within the tested ESMs in comparison to the environmental dimension, with the highest coverage observed for SDG8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), and SDG17 (Partnerships for the Goals) relative to SDG10 (Reduced Inequalities) and SDG11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). The indicators pertaining to the social domain for SDG1 (No Poverty), SDG2 (No Hunger), SDG3 (Good Health and Well-Being), SDG4 (Quality Education), SDG5 (Gender Equality), and SDG16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions) displayed the weakest coverage across the shortlisted ESMs. Accordingly, in response to the second research question (“‎‎What prospects can expand the integration of SDGs into ESMs to leverage their capabilities?‎‎”) , a conceptual ESMs-SDGs integrated framework was proposed underscoring methodological IOs and offering new perspectives for the modeling paradigm to advance the SDGs integration in ESMs. The discussion follows with several theoretical and practical implications from policy and managerial perspectives. The strength of this work lies in undertaking a systematic in-depth analysis investigating the SDGs integration across different types of commonly used and broadly applicable ESMs based on micro-level using the 248 indicators defined by the UN. The study contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between ESMs and SDGs and identifies areas (sustainability issues and corresponding targets-indicators) where further efforts are imperative to fill existing gaps. It also provides a useful evidence-based methodology to evaluate the efficacy of ESMs in contributing towards achieving SD. The derived interlinkages represent the status quo for the degree of representation of SDGs in the selected suite of ESMs, while the proposed framework provides a fitting basis of a new guideline for analyzing advanced methodologies for ESMs to pinpoint provisions for accelerating progress towards the 2030 agenda. Moving forward, stakeholders can use the framework and corresponding IOs to build upon and strengthen existing ESMs by integrating a wider spectrum of the SDGs, thus avoiding repetition in methodologies and modeling tools development. The findings of this study also have several paramount implications for future practice. The application of the suggested IOs will help align energy research more closely with SD and prioritize the development of new integrated policy initiatives considering the tripartite EES domains for the SDGs. These findings provide policymakers and other decision-makers including energy planners and business managers, with a basis to assess existing practical regimes and overcome loopholes in current governance structures that may hinder the transition towards the 2030 agenda. While this study contributes to the subject field by understanding the interlinkages of SDGs within existing ESMs, it still has several limitations to be overcome in future efforts. In this context, the number of applications per model may potentially confine the scope of the study and underestimate the capabilities of certain ESMs, particularly those that were applied extensively such as LEAP and TIMES. Incorporating a larger sample of case studies can reduce the selection bias, improving the assessment of individual model capabilities in relation to the SDGs. Furthermore, the current portfolio of ESMs is broader than this study explored through a select set, representing a first-order estimate of the extent to which ESMs cover the SDGs. Exploration of additional modeling suites with different types of mathematical methodologies can help expand and improve the generalizability of the current findings. For example, the underlying methodology for models like the International Futures and iSDG which are more specialized to the SDGs, can be examined to inspire further developments in ESMs. Moreover, the interlinkages analysis relied on the synthesis of scientific publications and how well the shortlisted case studies using ESMs were able to capture the SDGs. Thus, the derived insights are by no means a complete indication of the models actual capabilities. Furthermore, the ambiguity of assessing the case studies exogenously to account for indirect linkages may introduce subjective judgements, potentially over- or underestimating the actual performance of a modeling tool. As a result, the extent of SDGs coverage did not lend itself to discernible patterns across the various types of ESMs investigated in this study. For that, the proposed framework offers high-level recommendations for advancing SDGs into ESMs, which were kept generic to apply to different types of modeling techniques (bottom-up, top-down, and hybrid). The adopted methodology and subsequent outcomes can be further complemented with feedback from relevant stakeholders. Combining present insights from the practical applications with technical perspectives referring to the built-in attributes and functionalities of ESMs by drawing upon inputs from models developers, enhances the understanding of the modeling tool capabilities and tailors recommendations to specific model types, purposes, and archetypes. Expert feedback, coupled with the findings of this study, can also facilitate harnessing the synergies and trade-offs inherent in the SDGs into systems models, to ensure that policies designed to address specific SDGs do not inadvertently hinder the ability to achieve others. Expert elicitation can be carried out by leveraging methods like the Analytic Hierarchy Process or Delphi technique.
