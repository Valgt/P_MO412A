                  The future limitation of certain types of minerals due to reduced availability and monopolization of their production requires international legal principles to forecast and respond to international environmental policy. The efficiency and complexity of mineral extraction in terms of environmental, social, governance (ESG) principles is largely determined by the level of professional competence of an extractive company. The level of professional competence of a resource extraction engineer is the equivalent of trust in the company's activities and its ability to comply with ESG principles. The paper proposes for consideration a system for determining the levels of professional competencies of the “Professional Resource Extraction Engineer” based on the “International Standards for Resource Extraction Engineers (ISREE)". Threshold requirements for additional knowledge are expected to be introduced in areas such as ethics, safety, environment and preservation of financial viability. The developed methodology and digital indicators for evaluating the activities of public extractive companies, with consideration to ESG principles and sustainable development goals (SDG), allows increasing transparency and trust in its activities of the local population.

In recent years, the world economy has experienced an increase in prices of many natural resources. The exhaustion of natural resources and their limited amount within the Earth, available for human consumption, is obvious. The national policy framework of all countries is focused on labor productivity due to increased demand for energy, materials. The report of the International Resource Panel (IRP, 2020 ) indicates the need for radical reduction in the global use of resources in order to achieve both environmental and socio-economic goals. The growing demand and slowdown in the development of new reserves foreshadows serious problems with the supply of minerals in the future. Taking into account the global problems with the provision of raw materials, systemic innovations are required that provide motivation for a large-scale improvement in the quality of training of engineering personnel not only in the field of exploration, production, but also in the use and processing of minerals, taking into account the challenges of increasing energy and resource conservation. On the one hand, transnational mining and oil and gas companies continue to develop as can be seen from their environmental reports (Lock and Seele, 2016; Wang and Sarkis, 2017 ) including their declared corporate social responsibility (CSR). Yet, the debate about their activities in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals, especially in developing countries, remains fierce with its outcome unclear (Hilson, 2012 ). The local populations' criticism against the subdivisions of public extractive companies in Latin America, Africa and Asia, as well as in countries with deposits on the continental Arctic shelf is sharply increasing. Despite the companies declaring their commitment to the green agenda and talking a lot about the importance of CSR in their activities, in practice the situation is still ambiguous. Environmental and social issues are often ineffectively addressed due to the constraining influence of companies' top management and regional leaders, which minimize regulatory requirements and marginalize dissent by using their reputation and ignoring the participation of local communities in active industrial activities related to extractive operations in the area of their residence (Parsons et al., 2014 ). There are no unified indicators evaluating the companies' compliance with the ESG principles and the methodology for their application in relation to financial sustainability (Tamazian et al., 2009 ; Garcia et al., 2017 ; Nedosekin et al., 2019 ). When considering SDG in the activities of extractive companies, it is necessary to take into account the processes associated with the artificial acceleration of energy transition and the complex of ephemeral problems concerning the hydrogen economy and its partial decarbonization. Raw materials and energy are the means to an end; whereas the goal is health, a high standard of living, sustainable economy and clean environment. In 1954, the American psychologist Abraham Maslow (1954)  claimed in his book that “the ideal society”, is first of all a society of well-fed people who have no reason to be afraid”. The famous economist, Vaclav Smil from the University of Manitoba (Canada) states that the energy transition will not happen rapidly and “the transition from coal and oil to wind and solar energy is not a matter of several decades, but a matter of generations.” (Smil, 2021 ). These and many other problems, which are not taken into account in the formation of public consciousness, create an environment of uncertainty that hinders the inflow of investment capital, the growth of the mineral resource base of hydrocarbon resources and the development of extractive companies in general. Scientific research on the role of H2  in the global energy system presenting the achievements in the field of hydrogen energy assesses the status of hydrogen and its ability to ensure the transition to low-carbon energy (Staffell et al., 2019). When considering implementation of the hydrogen economy (Ritter et al., 2003 ), scientists optimistically estimate it will take several decades for the lightest gas in nature to become an alternative to fossil fuels. Achievements in obtaining H2  (Logan, 2004 ; Glenk and Reichelstein, 2019 ) show that this is a scientifically solvable task, but its implementation on the scale of Global Energy is economically and technologically ambiguous (Armstrong et al., 2016 ). The compromise between energy security and other sustainable development goals should provide mankind with the following: the prospect of greater prosperity and well-being; the creation of physical and social infrastructure for sustainable development and sound management of the natural environment (McCollum et al., 2018 ; Fuso Nerini et al., 2018 ). Scientific progress has reduced man's dependence on the surrounding ecosystem because of the vast possibilities for converting energy and producing goods and services based on it. At the same time, humanity is destroying the environment affecting our daily lives and mentalities leading to the transformation of the society that is losing confidence in democratic values. Considering the above mentioned, the SDGs and the ESG environmental and social requirements for the management of extractive companies require specification of measures and implementation of fundamentally different scenarios for assessing the activities and mission of extractive companies in the long term, taking into account: the geopolitical environment; energy transition trends; decarbonization processes and digital ESG indicators in the context of sustainable development goals. In this article, we assume the need for a more active policy in the field of increasing the level of professional competence of resource extraction engineers, not only in matters of working with the deposit, but also in the ability to solve such large-scale problems as environmental diplomacy, as well as the trust of the indigenous population to ensure access to mineral deposits, which are often located in places where there are no professional workers, and even internal conflicts occur.  2 Mineral resources and trends of the world economy Raw materials present a unique influence on the development of the countries in which they are located. They ensure: economic growth, creation of jobs and the sustainable development of the society. For the countries in possession of such resources, minerals become a strategic geopolitical tool, considering that some of the relatively profitable types are concentrated in a handful of countries. It is customary to remain silent about the environmental damage that accompanies the work with the fields, the conditions of the production itself, the quality of jobs, the use of child labor, and the living standards of the local population. Taking into account that raw materials, especially hydrocarbon resources and services obtained at the first stage of their processing, are the basis of world trade, the governments of many countries, especially those buying the resources, want to influence the change in public opinion regarding the future of the world economy (Schleussner et al., 2016 ; Turner, 2004 ). The sustainability of the extractive industry, including the implementation of various environmental and social principles will depend on the formation of public opinion of the new production patterns and the international perception and trust of the initiated innovations developing the economy of the future. When solving the problem of anthropogenic impact on ecosystems, we cannot limit ourselves only to the issues of preserving the natural biological environment, contrary to the beliefs of the adherents of the formation of the new economy that consider those issues the key ones. For each individual one of the most important conditions is the preservation of a cultural environment created by their ancestors and themselves. In today's world, raw materials and global energy are the main tools for maintaining economic stability and sustainable development. That said, the prospective energy paradigm transformation has to be examined against the fundamental changes in the world economy and inevitable shift of social structures. We must also take into account the rapidly growing influence of social media on public opinion, which often promotes the interests of a narrow group of beneficiaries under the banner of building an “ideal society”. Our civilization demonstrates a certain apathy towards the principles of energy transition recommended to society, and a lot of support to the proposed environmental projects. At the same time, the public opinion is influenced by the advantages of “green” energy, which is used as a tool of consumer loyalty, preventing the analysis of numerous risks: from nuclear conflict, to the distribution of costs and benefits over time; given the fact that the profits from the operation of the new energy infrastructure will be derived not by those who bear the costs today, but by unknown people in the distant future (Ehrlich and Ehrlich, 2013 ) According to Professor Klaus Schwab (2016) , founder and President of the World Economic Forum, “of the many diverse and fascinating challenges facing contemporary society, the most important and impressive is the realization and shaping of a new technological revolution that involves, at the very least, the transformation of mankind”. According to the adherents of the fourth industrial revolution (Ghobakhloo, 2020 ), the partially implemented and future planned changes in the world economy will contribute to economic growth and mitigate some of the global problems that our civilization has already faced. Ideologues in particular claim that digitalization and the “virtually limitless possibilities” it brings will integrate the unmet needs of two billion people into the global economy stimulating additional demand for existing goods and services (Maynard, 2015 ; Prisecaru, 2016 ; Liao et al., 2017 ). In other words, it will help revitalize the global economy by involving the residents of developing countries, many of which still do not have access to electricity, let alone the Internet, in commodity-money relations. But will that be the actual result? Are there any guarantees that “great opportunities” will outweigh the “potential dangers "? And what factors should ensure the success of the implemented initiatives? Undoubtedly, the development of social material culture through the implementation of ideology of the fourth industrial revolution will depend primarily on the efficiency of processes of energy production, conversion and conservation, as well as the flexibility and sustainability of the technological system of global energy, which requires spending more than 9% of world gross domestic product (GDP) today. Yet, of course, this is not the only factor. Analysis of the current state of the global economy and intergovernmental relations, the transformation of the energy system, and the transformation of the IT giants into independent centers of influence, often more powerful than national governments, leads to a number of conclusions.1. The formation and implementation of innovative technologies is associated with great uncertainties. That means we do not yet have a clear understanding of all the consequences the prospective changes introduced by this industrial revolution might cause.  2. Considering the interdependence of all sectors of the national economy, significant integration of national economies requires the maximum level of trust and responsibility on the part of all global market participants: heads of state, businesses, scientists. Efficient and well-managed work of international regulators responsible for liberalization of WTO foreign economic activities designed to help remove the barriers that hinder market competition is equally important.  3. IT technologies aimed at reducing costs in all areas already determine the competitiveness of companies and entire countries. However, many global players find themselves under significant pressure from corporations from other industries or states, a number of national governments or their coalitions. Similar pressure is applied towards the states unwilling or unable, due to economic circumstances, to build their own innovative ecosystems.  4. Only the transnational corporations, in particular the IT giants, whose capitalization has increased significantly in the present years and has already reached astronomical values, will benefit from the fourth industrial revolution. In the absence of a global regulator, the consequence could well be a further increase in inequality, which is contrary to the principles of sustainable development.  5. The projects being implemented as a part of the industrial revolution are large-scale and require huge investments, which will be attracted primarily by cutting social programs. Such action will require a comprehensive analysis of their relevance, including the assessment of geopolitical consequences as well as the availability of competencies that allow managing such risks. Particularly, if they could lead to potential job losses and decrease in the population's income in certain countries.    In addressing climate and environmental challenges in the new world economy, the energy sector of most countries risks being discriminated against resulting in the decrease in stability not only in the energy field, but also in the economies of those countries as a whole. For example, during the recent EU summit on January 25, 2021, the European Council approved the concept of climate and energy diplomacy (“Climate and Energy Diplomacy - Delivering on the external dimension of the European Green Deal”) (Climate and Energy Diplomacy, 2021 ) focused on the implementation of the European Green Deal on an international scale. The plan is to promote the spread of the green energy and climate agenda outside the EU, in particular, by reducing investments in infrastructure projects aimed at the development of conventional energy. Amongst other things, the initiative also includes countries that, due to economic realities, are unable to intensify the transition to a new energy system. Meanwhile the upstream capital investment scenario (Rystad Energy, 2020 ) clearly shows a sharp decline in global investment from $900 billion in 2014 to $400 billion in 2020. The downward trend is recorded against the background of the absence of the hydrogen market as a resource for global energy, objective limitations that prevent the large-scale introduction of RES, as well as the natural growth of the planet's population up to 1% per year, which automatically increases energy consumption. Thus, the outlook for hydrocarbon markets and the world energy sector as a whole is now determined to a lesser extent by economic factors and to a greater extent by geopolitical factors. Such factors as the need to prevent climate change and to minimize the commodity dependence of post-industrial states on hydrocarbon-importing countries by using renewable sources of energy, especially wind and solar. The consequences of the new global energy balance paradigm will be a decrease in the energy intensity of the global GDP, an increase in the wealth gap between “rich” and “poor” countries, an objective increase in the cost of all kinds of natural resources and, as a result, high-margin direct consumption goods. Fiscal crises, sovereign debt crises, regional and global pandemics, international military and political instability will increase the already excessive level of uncertainty in global hydrocarbon markets, demand for which will remain significant for many decades to come.  3 Features of the resource-extractive business with regard to ESG principles Raw materials, especially hydrocarbons, given their particular impact on the development of any country's economy and the global economy as a whole, should not be seen by society as mere commodities, but as a geopolitical resource. Transnational publicly traded oil, gas and mining companies have a major impact on various areas and processes of the global economy, including active transformation of the world economy into a single market for goods, services, capital, labour and knowledge. This leads to an erosion of the autonomy of states and limits the ability of governments to perform their functions solving certain problems of their citizens. The successful implementation of the SDGs and ESG principles whеn working with the fields directly depends on the processes taking place in the global economy. And to a large extent - on the adequate management of public opinion by the international IT system, whose actions have no bounds and are outside of the state influence. Protectionist policies in the field of raw materials, especially hydrocarbons, in the context of the current pursuit of a new hydrogen economy and ephemeral possibilities of alternative energy could cause serious credibility failures in our consumer-urban civilization. The consequences could be very negative. Considering the external factors beyond the control of the extractive companies, yet affecting the market environment in the sector, the specificities of the mining and oil and gas sector should be taken into account: 1. All extractive operations have a negative impact on the ecosystem. The companies' challenge is to use such technologies and techniques that minimize this impact while, simultaneously, performing comprehensive and complete extraction of all useful components. 2. The production of some minerals that are economically viable at the current level of scientific and technological progress is concentrated in relatively few countries (e.g. tungsten, rare earth elements and antimony in China, niobium in Brazil, platinum group elements in South Africa and Russia, chromium in Kazakhstan). Raw materials are needed in large quantities while the demand for the entirely new minerals is also growing. Advanced economies are dependent on such imports, forcing post-industrial governments to exert considerable pressure on exporters to make decisions considering access to resources. Uneven distribution increases the risk of monopolization of the individual metals market. 3. Growing public awareness of the impact on the environment and health caused by mineral extraction and processing has created conditions that increase their value in the market, require additional production and social infrastructure, and negatively affect the access of specialized companies to the development of deposits. 4. More than 80 per cent of liquid reserves are at the disposal of the states, and the relationship between subsoil users and the state is based on an administrative and legal contract (license). Countries with underdeveloped economies use Civil Law contracts and other forms of agreements. Licensing relationships allow the state to have a significant influence on the company's activities and its compliance with ESG principles. 5. The exploitation, processing and transportation of all minerals are environmentally hazardous industries with high risk of causing damage. Companies use technologies to minimize the risks, but other challenges arise from inadequate performance of structures that provide insurance for these risks. 6. Demand for green economy metals shows rapid growth due to limited deposits, market monopolization and problems of their disposal. 7. There are other problems as well: many countries, for example, do not discourage child labour; extractive operations often require large amounts of fresh water; settled way of life and ethnic relations are subject to change; the level of urbanization also increases. The need to create high-tech industries for mineral extraction and processing requires new knowledge and the introduction of groundbreaking scientific advances. At the same time, management and shareholders of subsoil user companies want to understand how to achieve financial sustainability while complying with more strict ESG principles. The return on investment of new extractive projects is measured in years and their volume is impressive. Economic growth requires raw materials and energy, and their consumption over the past 100 years has been rising by an average of 1–3 percent per year. The struggle for access to mineral deposits, especially oil and gas, lies at the heart of public policy in all industrialized countries. Humanity is now more dependent on raw materials, especially energy generated from hydrocarbons, than it used to be. The shift in the global economy is a matter of technological advancements and the emergence of a new energy-rich resource. Over the past 30 years, the extremely poor population has decreased fourfold, to 600 million. What matters most to humanity is health, education and quality of life. There is now a widespread demand in society for a new mining producer for whom ecology and the social environment are equivalent to high income. Today, financing for the mineral sector is declining. Thus, in 2020, the reduction was 9% due to planned administrative measures, which creates serious problems of development sustainability. The green energy lobby deliberately ignores the fact that, apart from the obvious interest of financial institutions in profiting from investments in promising fossil fuel projects, their development and financial support comes from being essential to the current vital needs of people and the development of many economies. The level of investment support for initiated projects aimed at reserve additions and the development of energy-saving technologies is already lagging behind the indicators required to maintain the stability of the world mineral resource complex. A macroeconomic impact analysis of the decline of investment in fossil fuels (Mercure et al., 2018 ) argues that this process does not affect the demand. However, the authors do not take into account such factors as the long payback period of any investment in reserve additions (Brockway et al., 2019 ) and the fact that over 80 per cent of all reserves are concentrated in the hands of the states that are concerned with maintaining this situation because of the significant impact of the commodity complex on the growth of their economies. Mining and oil and gas public companies are highly technological and knowledge-intensive. Globally, they are socially responsible, and their activities in the regions where the deposits are located are considered a strategic tool for achieving sustainable development (McWilliams and Siegel, 2001 ). The success of a company largely depends on the availability and quality of resources, while compliance with the principles of social responsibility depends on the competence of managerial staff and mining engineers, the level of technology used, the influence of the state, the consumer income in the labour market and the stage of the life cycle (Matveeva et al., 2018 ; McWilliams and Siegel, 2001 ). The latest European Union (EU) environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure guidelines show their imperfections. As of today, there are no specific requirements regarding the type of non-financial indicators that can be included in annual reports(Camilleri, 2015 ). In other words, public opinion about a company is formed only on the basis of the actual annual report, which prevents the creation of conditions for participation in its assessment of representatives of public, professional communities, including shareholders and investors, in order to create a constructive environment of trust that can lead to continuous improvement in openness and the achievement of ESG. ESG environmental, social and governance rating agencies acting as relevant financial market players do not fully integrate sustainability principles in the process of assessing corporate stability (Escrig-Olmedo et al., 2019 ). It should be borne in mind that in a market economy any company, especially a public company, while solving any other issues, is obliged to fulfill its main goal - to be profitable and to work for the benefit of its shareholders and investors. ESG principles and the interests of the founders must be taken into account in any reliable and accurate assessment of corporate activities.  4 New requirements for resource extraction engineers The development of oil, gas and mining companies in a decarbonizing world economy is complicated not only by the artificial reduction of investment capital, but also by the increasing costs (up to 60%) of environmental measures and social responsibility of business. Commodity companies in the high-tech, knowledge-intensive sector of the global economy are subject to special public scrutiny, given the requirements of ESG principles as part of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. In a market economy, on the other hand, a company must fulfill its obligations to its founders and shareholders. As part of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement strategy, ESG has been positioned as a tool to activate the decarbonization of the global economy. However, the ESG principles as a mechanism acting on behalf of the majority has no (politico-legal) legitimacy. Much has been said about these principles; in particular empirical studies (Friede et al., 2015 ) have been conducted showing some progress. At the same time, the relationship between corporate performance and the impact of ESG on it is not clear due to a lack of information (Xie et al., 2019 ). A large number of extractive companies have been subjected to great uncertainty, with their activity in the focus of heightened public attention. There are attempts to address these problems, for example, the International Competence Center for Mining Engineering Education under the auspices of UNESCO has developed an approach and numerical indicators for public assessment of competencies, the basis of which is the determination and growth of the level of competence of extraction engineers. This factor underpins the companies’ ability to address environmental, social issues and make managerial decisions to improve business sustainability. The necessity to reduce investment risks, as well as growing public demands on occupational safety, environmental protection and the professional competence of an extraction engineer are the key challenges facing companies of the mineral resources sector. Only an adequate response taking into account the need for an ethical approach will align the development of the industry with the SDG strategy. A professional resource extraction engineer with advanced, higher-level competencies plays a crucial role in responding to the transformation demanded by the times. 4.1 Methodological approach Pressure on the extractive industry from stakeholders demanding the changes outlined above is increasing around the world. This means that extraction engineers able to implement those changes will be in even larger demand on the labour market. But how to determine that their knowledge and skills are sufficient to put these ideas into practice? We are proposing a new, globally-recognized competence framework for Resource Extraction Engineers that will be built on the existing national standards to develop higher competencies relevant to these challenges, therefore, helping the profession change for the better. What are these higher level competencies? Are they common for all extraction engineers globally? Answering these and similar questions will require different interested parties to contribute and share their views, needs and expectations. On the basis of their knowledge and experience the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining (IOM3) and the International Competence Center for Mining-Engineering Education under the auspices of UNESCO at Saint- Petersburg Mining University, have analysed existing global engineering standards (Tables 1 and 2   ). There is no single international standard of competence or other standard by which resource extraction engineers are assessed and accredited in the world. Each country involved in the development of mineral resources has created its own standard, and despite some commonalities, they are fundamentally different, as are the methods used to evaluate candidates. One of the benchmarking criteria applied to extraction companies is the development of national competencies of employees, but in this process every company is faced with the fact that each country has its own evaluation system. A single international standard would guarantee the uniformity of competencies regardless of the region. Table 1  compares the competencies required by some international standards and the UK standard. The competence systems are seemingly the same, and focus on engineering knowledge, its application for innovative purposes, mastery of standards and regulatory documents, managerial competences, communication skills, ethical behaviour and commitment to sustainable development. But when examined in detail, each system has its own characteristics and differences in assessment methods and accreditation procedures. Applicable national and international systems include the necessary minimum competence requirements for staff, regardless of industry, but the specifics of the resource extraction sector require a different approach to assessment. National systems are beyond doubt, but in an increasingly globalised professional and business environment, given the importance of the commodities sector, the role of resource extraction engineers in the success or failure of a mining project, and the significant amounts of capital and corporate social responsibility applied to projects to secure such funding there is a need for a unified international standard of competence for resource extraction engineers, higher standards, the first step in obtaining an international title will be certification in one of the national systems. Monitoring has also been carried out in countries where currently available and published standards have been identified (Table 2 ). Some conclusions that can be drawn from this list of countries:• There is a lack of indigenous professional standards in Africa, particularly given its raw material industrial sector and known reserves. Whilst artisanal mining is common in Africa, there is an organized extractives sector and it is possible that they rely upon ‘bought in’ talent – mining engineers who have qualified as CEng or competent persons in their own country.  • South America has a growing mining industry, for example the ‘ABC Lithium Triangle’ of Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile, and IOM3 has been involved on an advisory basis on the creation of national mining engineering competency standards in these countries, which are at a formative stage.  • As expected, countries in Asia, Europe, North America, and the Middle East who have long established raw material industrial sectors have indigenous professional standards in place.    The proposed first draft of an international competence framework for Resource Extraction Engineers, taking into account the following factors:• Many countries and/or territories have structures in place through which resource extraction engineers can, or in some cases should, be formally recognized as professionals. This is important to establish the standards of knowledge, understanding of skills and experience that underpin the competence of mining engineers in their respective fields of activity.  • Extractive industry around the world is increasingly pressured to change faster and more radically. For example, some major investors want to reduce the risks inherent in extractive operations and are increasingly demanding that extractive companies clearly demonstrate their ethics, be safer, do less damage to the environment while being financially viable. Each of these four areas, ethics, safety, the environment and finance are the areas in which operating to even higher standards could reduce the following risks: risks to business reputation, of harming people involved in and affected by extractive activities, as well as risks to the world that supports our way of life, and to its financial base.  • Resource extraсtion engineers are key influencers in extractive businesses who work in all sectors of the industry, such as investor relations, research and development of new technologies and processes, upstream and downstream operations, regulation, and audit and pollution prevention. They are, therefore, in a unique position to help respond to the pressures on extractive sector around the world.  • Helping resource extraction engineers identify the new and/or deeper knowledge in the four areas noted above, understand how that knowledge integrates and can be applied to better effect, and then demonstrate that application of those skills will improve extractive practices, hence, reducing the risks. We refer to the combination of knowledge, understanding and skill as ‘competence’.    For convenient referencing, we use the provisional working title of International Standard for Resource Extraction Engineers (ISREE ) to describe this framework. Application of a broad range of relevant technical, managerial and leadership skills will lead change in relevant aspects of the extractive operations cycle meeting society's highest ethical standards (Fig. 1  ) and, in particular: 4.1.1 Ethics • Identify and mitigate mining-related risks and elect when to make decisions with uncertain and incomplete information.  • Conduct stakeholder engagement based upon the analysis of the local context.  • Implement inclusive approaches with local communities to identify their development priorities and support activities that contribute to their lasting social and economic wellbeing.  • Demonstrate how advanced knowledge and understanding have been applied to develop mining operations that take full account of Human Rights.  • Build effective reciprocal working relationships with host and local communities.  • Manage change of ownership of the mine, its effects and impacts.  • Manage closure planning, redeployment of local staff, transferable skills, and retraining.  • Ensure an ethical approach to aftercare management, including lasting legacies, and to any economic effects on local communities following closure or sudden liquidation.  • Manage closure funds and other financial mechanisms to meet sound ethical principles.  • Promote sound ethical approaches within the supply chain.     4.1.2 Safety • Incorporate safety as a fundamental factor during the design of processes and systems, and in the application of technologies.  • Implement effective risk-management strategies that consult and take account of the safety of all stakeholder groups.  • Implement risk-based controls to avoid/prevent, minimize, mitigate and/or remedy health, safety and environmental impacts on workers, local communities, cultural heritage, and the natural environment, based upon a recognized international standard or management system.  • Optimize the application of new technologies and/or new applications of technologies for improving the safety of mining operations.  • Assess and manage safety risks of new projects and of significant changes to existing operations in consultation and collaboration with interested and affected stakeholders, using the established and best available techniques.  • Develop, maintain, and test effective disaster prevention and emergency response plans.  • Take a lead in encouraging partners, suppliers, and contractors to adopt responsible health and safety, environmental, human rights and labour policies and practices.     4.1.3 Environment • Comply with international best available practices e.g. Equator Principles, those from the International Finance Corporation, and the International Council on Mining and Metals.  • Integrate sustainable development principles into decision-making relating to the design, operation, maintenance, protection, of physical assets and facilities, and the closure of facilities.  • Assess environmental risks and opportunities of new projects and of significant changes to existing operations in consultation with interested and affected stakeholders.  • Assess and address risks and impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services by implementing the mitigation hierarchy, with the ambition of achieving no-net-loss of biodiversity.  • Apply the mitigation hierarchy to prevent pollution, manage releases and waste, and address potential impacts on human health and the environment.  • Implement best available techniques to limit emissions from extractive production.  • Create and implement energy consumption and reduction plans/targets using the best available techniques.  • Implement cost-effective measures for the recovery, reuse or recycling of energy, natural resources, and materials in project design, operation, and decommissioning.  • Implement measures to improve energy and water efficiency.  • Plan and design for closure in consultation with relevant authorities and stakeholders, implement measures to address closure-related environmental and social aspects, and make financial provision to enable agreed closure and post-closure commitments to be realized.  • Design, construct, operate, monitor, and decommission tailings disposal/storage facilities using comprehensive, risk-based management and governance practices in line with internationally recognized best practices and industry standards to minimize the risk of catastrophic failure.  • Undertake external and internal audit planning.  • Manage mine wastes from waste oils to overburden and storage.  • Effectively manage hazardous and non-hazardous reagents and storage     4.1.4 Financial Planning • Develop, implement, and manage capital expenditure plans.  • Develop, implement, and manage operating expenditure plans.  • Develop, implement, and manage project and programs financial plans.  • Integrate ethical, safety, and environmental principles into financial planning decisions.  • Take a lead in encouraging partners, suppliers, and contractors to adopt responsible health and safety, environmental, human rights and labour policies and practices.  • Manage the balance between short-term profitability and the creation of financial and non-financial value in the long-term.    The scenario of forming international professional competences “Professional Resource Extraction Engineer” is presented in Fig. 2  . Specified responsibility of the educational institution, company and professional community improves the quality of educational and professional standards and enables the represented public organizations and institutions to monitor (technological, sanitary, environmental and other norms), to participate in the work of attestation commissions and to receive objective information on the quality of the accreditation procedure itself. This system allows the use of national standards for the accreditation of non-market companies. The structure of the “International Standard for Resource Extraction Engineers” assumes higher requirements and, importantly, an international registration form that must meet those requirements that exceed the ESG given specifications and principles.   4.2 Practical application The above listed methodology (Fig. 2 ) of the system of international accreditation of resource extraction engineers provides:• the responsibility of the university - professional competencies at the level of educational standards;  • the responsibility of the company - gaining practical skills on the job as: a specialist and master - 4 years, bachelor – at least 4 years plus further learning;  • short-term courses (up to one month) under the “International Standards for Resources Extraction Engineers (ISREE)” professional programs organized by the accreditation center training facilities involving certified specialists from the professional community;  • qualification to national standard of Professional Engineer status through a peer review process;  • obtaining a national and international certificate for the “Professional Resource Extraction Engineer” competency with inclusion in the international register.    Based on this accreditation of resource extraction engineers, a methodology and numerical indicators have been developed to assess the compliance of stock market companies with ESG principles as the basis of SDGs for the mineral-resources sector of the global economy:• the percentage of professionals accredited for the title of “Professional Resource Extraction Engineer";  • engineers to workers ratio;  • the management structure (management company, top management from among shareholders);  • proportion of workers from the local population;  • the share of engineering specialists from among the population of the country in which the company operates;  • the ratio of the average salary of company employees to the average salary in the regions where the company operates;  • the ratio of average employee salaries to average top management salaries;  • share of funding for training and reproduction of personnel;  • share of funding for creating social environment for employees;  • the availability of a system of incentives for professional development;  • the rates of occupational injury;  • productivity indicator (labour input per one unit of product);  • assessment of applied technologies;  • other indicators.    We propose that the national bodies operating the different national standards could each be recognized as a Partner to ISREE. Extraction Engineers who wish to apply for ISREE recognition would need to be registered with, or be a member of, the ISREE Partner for their home nation before being able to apply for ISREE. If there is no ISREE Partner for their home nation, they would need to be registered with, or be a member of, another ISREE Partner.   5 Conclusion The entire cycle of working with a deposit and extraction of minerals is a high-tech and science-intensive sector of the world economy and belongs to environmentally harmful industries. In the conditions of decarbonization on a scale of all mankind, new opportunities open up for extractive industry companies, yet new risks and uncertainties appear increasingly due to the emergence of various problems associated with the acceleration of energy transition, increased requirements for ESG principles, artificial reduction of investment capital in the growth of reserves and development of production. An extraction engineer has the greatest influence in the extractive sector. An engineer accredited for the title of “Professional Resource Extraction Engineer” presents a combination of knowledge, understanding and skills. The developed methodology and approach to organizing the assessment of the level of competence of an extraction engineer is not a dogma, but is an important step to build confidence in the development of ESG principles in the extractive industry. We have come to the conclusion that a more active policy is needed to improve the professional competence of resource extraction engineers, not only in matters of working with the deposit, but also in the ability to solve such large-scale problems as: environmental diplomacy, as well as the trust of the indigenous population to ensure access to the mineral deposit, which are often located in places where there are no professional workers, and where even internal conflicts occur. The sustainable development goals and the ESG environmental and social principles of a mining and oil and gas company should consider the specificities of this production sector. Specific measures and other scenarios are required for the public evaluation of the long-term activities and mission of extractive companies in the region, taking into account: financial sustainability, geopolitical environment, trends of accelerated energy transition, credibility of its activities and ability to comply with ESG principles. The extractive industry around the world is changing, and the pressure on it is increasing due to the artificial acceleration of decarbonization processes. To reduce risks, extractive companies must demonstrate their ethics to the residents of the regions where they operate, be safer, do less damage to the environment while maintaining financial viability. Reduction of investment risks, artificial reduction of investment capital, growth of public demand for occupational safety, environmental protection, improvement of social environment, increased requirements for professional competence of an extraction engineer are the key problems of the global extractive industry. Professional extraction engineers able to implement these factors in practice will become even more in-demand and in acute shortage. The efficiency of extractive industry companies largely depends on the state they operate in, since more than 80% of the world's reserves of ore and hydrocarbon deposits are state-owned. This means that as the requirements for compliance with the ESG principles expand, the company's ability to fulfill its corporate and social obligations decreases. The strategy of major stock players will be aimed at increasing the investment portfolio of government debt securities. The ESG principle in the mineral-resources sector has little impact on greenhouse gas emissions and on the promotion of energy efficient technologies and equipment. This is due to a lack of international legitimacy, based on the right to act on behalf of the majority of the population while taking into account the specifics of extractive production, the starting capacities of states, specific numerical indicators for assessing activities, and the participation of local community representatives in the process. The level of professional competence, education as well as technical, managerial and leadership skills of a company's extraction engineers is the equivalent of confidence in its development and ability to meet ESG principles and sustainable development goals. The methodology and numerical indicators for assessing the human resource capacity of multinational public companies based on the “International Standards for Resource Extraction Engineers (ISREE)" will make it possible to achieve progress in assessing their compliance with ESG principles based on the creation of uniform requirements for all market participants through the Stock Exchange by introducing an additional section to the annual report (tentative name) “Green Corridor".
