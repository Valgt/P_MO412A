                  In recent years, governments, donors and policy makers across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have increasingly realised the potential of formalizing and supporting artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) – low tech, labour-intensive mineral processing and extracting. A significant body of evidence suggests that ASM has become the most important rural non-farm activity across SSA, and by making it the centrepiece of new rural development strategies being launched across the continent, it could help governments meet a number of targets linked to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Focusing on the West African country of Sierra Leone, this paper explores recent reforms to ASM, examining both their potential to support a formalized sector, and to make contributions to the SDGs. In doing so, two broad sets of formalization reforms that have taken place, or are underway, are analysed. First, the paper examines Sierra Leone’s legal, policy and regulatory reforms that have shaped the development of a number of laws and policies, including the Mines and Minerals Act of 2009. Second, it analyses institutional reforms resulting from the splitting of policy making and regulatory functions, especially the decentralization of the artisanal mining licencing process. The paper argues that beneath these changes, there exists intractable continuities of informality that make reforms in the sector superficial, unsustainable, and potentially a barrier to attaining the SDGs. Underlining these continuities, the paper suggests, is the role that ASM has traditionally played in a political economy that links powerful local Chieftains with national politicians in mutually beneficial relationships, which invariably render formal state regulators such as the National Minerals Agency and Environment Protection Agency largely uncoordinated, and operationally weak. The paper concludes by arguing that that the persistence of informality in the sector needs to first be dismantled as a rational strategy for those who profit from it, and only then can sustainable mining reforms be linked to broader development initiatives, such as attaining the SDGs.

Keywords Informality  Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM)  Sierra Leone  Mining policy reforms  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)    1 Introduction In recent years, a growing body of research and scholarship has argued that formalizing and supporting artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) – low-tech, labour- intensive mineral processing and extraction – could help governments in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) meet development targets linked the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (see, for example, Hilson and Maconachie, 2020 ; Mensah et al., 2020 ; de Haan et al., 2020 ; Sippl, 2019 ). A formalized ASM sector, it has been contended, would map on directly to some of the core themes of the SDGs, including poverty alleviation, food security, gender and the environment, in the process providing the traction needed in policy circles to ensure their effectiveness in the long term. This body of academic work has been complemented by growing recognition and support in donor and government spaces across SSA, which now increasingly acknowledge the economic and livelihoods importance of ASM. However, ASM has not always been recognised as a driver of development in policy circles.1  1 As recently as 2016, the UNDP published Mapping Mining to the Sustainable Development Goals: A Preliminary Atlas  (United Nations Development Programme (UNDP, 2016 ), which was designed as a roadmap for clarifying how mining can and should contribute to the SDGs. While the document argues that large-scale, foreign-financed mining investments are important for helping resource-rich countries reach development targets associated with the SDGs, ASM is barely mentioned in this discussion, except for when it relates to large-scale mining.   In fact, historically, there has been a catastrophic failure of government policies to recognise the importance of ASM as a possible means to achieving more sustainable and equitable development outcomes (Hilson and McQuilken, 2014 ). To a large degree, this has been due to the fact that many host governments continue to have a fixation on large-scale mining, holding the view that capital-intensive, mechanized investments in the mineral sector are the most desirable strategy for pursuing extractives-led development (see Hilson, 2019 ). Notably, the recent global fanfare around the SDGs and ‘Leaving No-One Behind’, presents new possibilities for re-aligning ASM formalization strategies with the SDG agenda. Three obvious areas that underpin ASM’s developmental importance in SSA, all of which should feature prominently in plans designed around the SDGs, include: 1) the sector’s contribution to revenue generation; 2) its contribution to employment; and 3) its links with agriculture. Indeed, each of these key areas links closely with the sustainable development priorities identified at the Africa Regional Consultative Meeting on Sustainable Development Goals that was organised by UNECA and the African Union in 2013 (Hilson and Maconachie, 2020 ). While the development challenges associated with ASM cross-cut into most of the 17 SDGs, some of the goals and targets are directly applicable to the sector. For example, much research now suggests that ASM is a poverty-driven activity, but one which also has the potential to generate a livelihood for millions of people and offer new forms of wealth creation (SDG 1: End Poverty). In the process, ASM creates upstream and downstream linkages, generating employment and income for further investment (SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth). Likewise, a sizeable body of analysis has emerged which explores the inter-locking nature of agriculture and ASM (SDG 2: End Hunger) and its ability to generate income for women (SDG 5: Gender Equality) (see, for example, Maconachie and Binns, 2007 ; Maconachie, 2011 ; Maconachie and Hilson, 2011 ). It is direct linkages such as these that have supported an emerging consensus that ASM should feature more prominently in sustainable development strategies, policies and programmes across SSA. So why is it the case that policies and programmes which aim to promote the sustainability of the sector often continue to perform poorly? At the heart of many failed reforms which have aimed to make ASM more sustainable, or link the sector to the SDGs, is the issue of poor governance and a degree of resistance to a formalized sector (Maconachie and Conteh, 2019 ). Such resistance must be located within the asymmetrical power dynamics which exist between different actors in the ASM sector, as well the political dynamics which operate at the subnational level. Indeed, in many countries in SSA, there is an historical tendency for resource wealth to be captured by ruling elites and to fuel patronage politics. Without an appreciation of these subnational power relationships, or an understanding of how natural resource revenues are implicated in political bargaining, donor-driven governance interventions that aim to make the ASM sector more sustainable will likely continue to yield disappointing results. The West African country of Sierra Leone, although endowed with abundant natural resources and among the world’s leading producers of diamonds, provides an illuminating example of why governance issues are central to the success or failure of ASM policy reforms that link to the SDGs. Diamond mining has long been Sierra Leone’s most lucrative export industry, and historically, ASM has provided an important livelihood for hundreds of thousands of poor people in rural areas. But colonial mining policies were initially created to protect the interests of powerful elites, while at the same time marginalizing those seeking to derive a local livelihood from the ASM sector.2  2 For example, see Government of Sierra Leone (1956)  Report on the Mines Department for the Year 1955. Government Printer. Freetown, Sierra Leone.   Post-colonial state policies subsequently built upon early colonial legislation, and continued to preserve elite interests. Since these early days, only a fraction of diamond wealth has returned to the areas where they are mined, and there has been little meaningful consideration given to how artisanal mining might contribute to more sustainable forms of development (Wilson, 2013a ). In Sierra Leone, diamonds were first discovered in Kono District in the Eastern Province in 1930, but it was not until the latter part of that decade that large-scale exploitation by the Sierra Leone Selection Trust (SLST) began under an exclusive 99-year mining lease granted by the government (Van der Laan, 1965 ; Reno, 1995 ). Early efforts to harness the wealth of diamonds focused almost exclusively on large-scale mining, initiating a ‘bias’ for large-scale extraction that would continue into the decades to follow. The export of the country’s diamonds reached its peak between the 1960s – 1970s, when annual production averaged US$ 250 million, accounting for 20 per cent of GDP (Davis, 2006 ). However, by the late 1970s, the diamond conglomerate De Beers, which at the time was the sole exporter of the country’s diamonds, was forced to end its monopoly as President Siaka Stevens took steps to control the sector, privileging his interests and those of his political and economic supporters (Reno, 1995 ). During this period, mining policy was driven by the imperatives of patrimonialism and regime survival, with little effort directed towards improving the social and economic conditions of citizens in mining areas. Unregulated ASM flourished, with elite actors capturing the majority of benefits from the sector. As diamond resources were appropriated by the government, official diamond exports rapidly fell from 1.7 million carats in the 1960s, to a mere 50,000 carats by 1985 (Temple, 2006 ). This system, it can be argued, has played an instrumental role in reinforcing the informality of the ASM sector, which persists to this day. By the mid-1980s, the ‘hollowing out’ of Sierra Leone’s diamond sector led to increasing scarcity of foreign currency and price controls, which left basic imports of rice and fuel permanently in short supply. Infrastructure deteriorated, wages rapidly declined and government services became non-functional. The stage was set for country’s ‘lost decade’ of civil war to follow in the 1990s. While the appropriation and mismanagement of the country’s diamond resources certainly played a significant role in fomenting the pre-conditions for the conflict, much has also been written on how ‘blood diamonds’ fuelled and prolonged Sierra Leone’s protracted period of insurgency (Gberie, 2005 , 2003 ; Maconachie, 2009 ; Reno, 2009 ; Davis, 2006 ; Bryceson and Jønsson, 2014 ; Raleigh and De Bruijne, 2017 ), where a cross-border exchange of diamonds-for-weapons took place between the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and Liberian President Charles Taylor. As Silberfein and Conteh (2006)  note, such illicit resource flows across borders are very difficult to regulate or contain, and they usually continue to occur even when sanctions and embargoes are in place because they are often controlled by powerful private interests. While there has been a significant amount of scholarship that has focused on Sierra Leone’s diamond-fuelled war, considerable debate remains as to whether the conflict was driven more by politics (“grievance”) or economic interests (“greed”). While it is true that some of the bitterest battles of the war were fought in the diamond mining areas of Kono District, the root cause of the conflict is now increasingly being linked to underlying questions that concern the marginalization of youth (Peters and Richards, 2011 ). A growing literature on the agrarian dimensions of Sierra Leone’s war, and more specifically the inter-generational tensions that drove the conflict, suggests that large numbers of socially excluded young people were prompted to embrace the war in a desperate search for empowerment. Apprehensions about youth marginalization were carried over into the post-war agenda, largely driven by fears that inequality and the continuing alienation of youth could be a potential source of further conflict (Wilson, 2013b ). Given these concerns, since the end of the country’s civil war there have also been noticeable attempts to reform the governance of the ASM sector to address the unequal nature of the artisanal diamond value chain and make diamond mining more sustainable. Building upon fieldwork conducted in Sierra Leone between 2017 and 2019, this paper analyses two broad sets of reforms. First, it examines the legal and policy reforms that have resulted in the development of a number of laws and policies, including the Mines and Minerals Act of 2009. It then analyses the institutional reforms that have resulted from the splitting of policy making and regulatory functions, particularly the decentralization of the artisanal mining licencing process. While these changes represent significant strides on the road to the formalization of the sector and the potential for ASM to contribute more directly to the SDGs, we argue that underlying them, there are intractable continuities of informality that make reforms in the sector superficial and unsustainable. Underscoring these continuities, the paper suggests, is the role diamonds have traditionally played in a political economy in which powerful local Chieftains are linked with national politicians in mutually beneficial relationships, which invariably render “formal” state regulators such as the National Minerals Agency (NMA) and Environment Protection Agency (EPA) largely uncoordinated, and operationally weak. Drawing on multi-sited fieldwork carried out in diamondiferous Kono District, and complemented by semi-structured interviews undertaken with government officials, policy makers, donors, and civil society activists in the cities of Koidu and Freetown, the paper proceeds as follows. Following this introduction, section two analyses the legal, policy and administrative reforms to the artisanal mining sector that have been implemented over the past 15 years, principally with donor support. Many of these reforms were designed to address key issues linked to the SDGs, including better environmental management. While such reforms appear to be extensive in a sector where there has been much political and administrative resistance, they are dependent on concessions that are less threatening to the elites’ control of artisanal mining. In the third section, the paper examines some of the areas in which reformed legislations have contradicted each other, and then explores the implications of such paradoxes for the sector. In doing so, it analyses the tensions that have emerged between different actors, and discusses how they have been mediated. The fourth section then analyses the bifurcated artisanal mining licencing process in which the NMA and Chiefs play mutually beneficial roles in the processing of licences. It is argued that the Chiefs’ role in this process represents one of the factors that is reinforcing informality in the sector. Finally, the paper analyses the persistence of informality, specifically looking at the limited staffing capacity of the NMA, the role of Chiefs and national politicians. The paper concludes by suggesting that the persistence of informality in the sector first needs to be dismantled as a rational strategy for those who profit from it, and only then can sustainable mining reforms be linked to broader development initiatives, such as attaining the SDGs.  2 The limits of post-war legal, policy and institutional reforms The laws and policies regulating Sierra Leone’s ASM sector have evolved considerably over the years, particularly since the end of the civil conflict in 2002. In the post-war period, the Government of Sierra Leone (GoSL) moved quickly to repeal old laws and policies, or develop new ones where they did not exist. Notable among the laws enacted since 2002, are the Mines and Minerals Act of 2009 (MMA 2009) and the Environment Protection Agency Act of 2008 (EPAA 2009). The MMA 2009, which repealed the Mines and Minerals Decree of 1994, and the Commission for the Management of Strategic Resources, National Reconstruction and Development Act of 1999, made provision for the co-existence of the various types of mining licencing regimes including, artisanal, small-scale, large-scale, exploration and reconnaissance. With specific reference to artisanal mining, the MMA 2009 restricted the ownership of mining rights to Sierra Leonean nationals, either as individuals or cooperatives. In relation to small-scale mining licences, the Act provided for partnerships between Sierra Leoneans and foreign investors, with the stipulation that a minimum of 25 % of the shares of any joint-venture should be owned by Sierra Leoneans (GoSL, 2009). As the Director of Mines noted in a recent interview, the logic behind the small-scale mining licence was to encourage artisanal miners to graduate into small-scale miners, although this progression has proved almost impossible to achieve.3  3 Interview with Director of Mines, National Minerals Agency, 2 February 2017, Freetown.   In terms of the financial provisions associated with the MMA 2009, royalties on diamonds were increased from 5 percent, to 6.5 percent, and from 4 to 5 percent for other minerals. However, for “special stones” with a market value of above five hundred thousand US dollars, the MMA stipulated a 15 percent royalty (Government of Sierra Leone, 2009 :116). But according to some commentators, these changes did not go far enough. As Batty (2013)  points out:Critics of the new act argued that the figures cited above are lesser than those demanded by some African countries for the exploitation of their natural resources. In comparison, they pointed out that as Africa’s leading diamond exporter, Botswana stipulated ten per cent royalty from diamonds in its Mines and Minerals Act of 1999 in addition to a legal right to freely acquire an equity interest in the range of 15–25 per cent in all ‘significant mineral operations’ (Batty, 2013 : 354).   Batty notes that many of the controversial provisions of the MMA 2009 are the result of a complex manoeuvring process orchestrated by multinational mining companies, donors and the Ministry of Mines and Mineral Resources, whose influence on the development of the law was far greater than other actors, including civil society (Batty, 2013 ). While there is strength in the argument that a post-war country such as Sierra Leone needs to secure as much revenue from the exploitation of its natural resources as possible, it is also fair to note that the country remains an unattractive investment destination, a predicament which is compounded by a lack of critical infrastructure, perceptions of political instability and incessant natural disasters (Conteh and Maconachie, 2019 ). Beyond the debate around the stipulated royalty percentages on diamonds, and why they may, or may not have been low, in practise their application has often been completely different from what is contained in law. For instance, one senior GoSL official noted that depending on who is exporting diamonds, the tax for the export of a “special stone” which by law should be 15 % of its total export value, can be brought down to as low as 3%, “if the exporter secures the support of people in government”.4  4 Interview with Senior Official, National Mineral Agency, 15 September 2017, Freetown.   This underscores the crippling effect of informality in the implementation of policy and law, which is enabled by a lack of checks and balances to ensure that administrative and political officials apply the law without considerations for personal gain. The personalization of the diamond trade by government officials, with the help of foreign dealers, has been well documented (see for example Reno, 1995 , 2009 ; Wilson, 2011 ). Although the influence of foreign diamond dealers has been reduced since the 1970−80s, they continue to influence processes in the diamond trade in more subtle ways, such as preventing the enactment of stringent laws that will wrestle control of the diamond trade from them. For example, it is widely believed within policy circles that the draft Precious Minerals Trading Bill of 2012, whose passage into law would go a long way in addressing entrenched poverty in the sector by radically changing the diamond trade in favour of ordinary miners and generating more revenues for government, is being stalled by vested interests in the industry. As one senior official of the NMA noted about the Bill:It establishes a diamond exchange or a cutting and polishing centre. If you set up one here, the top jewellery shops you see in London or New York will be setting up shops here, so if a miner gets his diamond in Kono or Kenema, he can just walk into one of those shops and get the true value of his diamond. But it’s about the willingness to do it. The passage of the bill is the only way you reorganise the market and do away with the monopoly of the few. Unfortunately, nobody is talking about it…You think the top exporters will want that to happen? 5  5 Interview with senior official of the National Minerals Agency, 4 February 2017, Freetown.     The inability of the government to enact the Precious Minerals Trading Bill into law is attributed to the lobbying, and sometimes corrupting power, of a business class which has for many years presided over an established monopoly over the diamond trade. It is also indicative of the deep-rooted nature of informality, which even the most well-intentioned laws and policies to make the sector more sustainable cannot affectively address. In addition to the prevalence of the undervaluing “special stones” by officials, and influencing the non-passage of mining laws considered inimical to the vested interests of dealers and exporters, some mining-related laws themselves have been in conflict with each other, exacerbating the very problems they are meant to solve.6  6 It is worth noting that the issue of sectoral laws contradicting each other in Sierra Leone is not limited to the mining sector; the same conflicting pattern has been documented in the decentralization of the health sector between 2003 and 2004 (see, Conteh, 2016 ).   For example, the MMA 2009 circuitously contradicts the Environment Protection Act of 2008 – which created the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) – in relation to licensing processes. According to the law, in granting a small or large-scale mining licence, the Minister of Mines and Mineral Resources, not the EPA, would need an environmental impact assessment licence as provided under the Environment Protection Act of 2008. While in theory the environmental provisions of the MMA 2009 have reasserted the superiority of the Ministry of Mines over the EPA and its laws, in practice the mining lease agreements (MLA) of companies have prioritised the EPA Act 2008 provisions over those of the MMA 2009 (Fanthorpe and Gabelle, 2013 ). This is, however, at odds with the country’s legal tradition in which succeeding laws automatically repeal or take precedence over preceding ones (Gaima, 2009 ). Further, although the EPA Act 2008 envisaged that the Minister responsible for the environment would have a supervisory role over the EPA, in practical terms, the EPA has been directly under the Office of the President, with the Chief of Staff in the Presidency, playing the role of the Minister. In Sierra Leone, such distortions between the provisions of law and how they are applied are most often underpinned by politics and the complex set of relationships among officials heading the various ministries, departments and agencies of the state, in relation to their standing with the President. Many officials interviewed for this paper, noted that the strong ties between the then Executive Director of the EPA and the former President, Ernest Koroma, allowed the Executive Director to prevail over her counterparts in disagreements, sometimes with serious implications for the growth and expansion of the mining sector. One case involving the small-scale mining company, Atlantic Minerals, which was granted a mining licence by the Minister of Mines and Mineral Resources but prevented from operating by the EPA, is worth particular mention. In this situation, the EPA had based its decision to halt operations on the need to protect the Bafin River in Kono District from environmental degradation, which would have been the site of the company’s operations.7  7 Interview with the Regional Manager, National Minerals Agency, 16 January 2017, Koidu.   The company, which had already started mobilizing staff and equipment, had to subsequently abandon the project after spending millions of dollars. Although it can be argued that it was within the power of the EPA to determine whether or not the operations of the company would adversely affect the river’s ecosystem, the timing of the decision, and the power of the Director of the EPA to render nullity to a licence granted by the Minister of Mines and Mineral Resources, had serious consequences. But part of the problem here also emanates from Sierra Leone’s horizontal, rather than vertical mining licence application process. From an ideal and more coordinated perspective, one would expect the licence application to go through several vertical stages, including assessment by the EPA, with the final stage being that of the Minister’s approval, thus preventing the occurrence of the case described above.  3 Legal contradictions, institutional overlap and contestations In addition to contradictions within the MMA 2009 and EPA Act 2008, the influence of politics and personal ties on the application of laws have had a significant influence in the mining sector, often derailing the ability of artisanal mining to contribute to the SDGs. With respect to environmental laws, the lack of clarity in the EPA Act 2008 on how the costs of environmental assessment licences should be calculated has led to contestations between the NMA, EPA and mining companies. The relevant law regarding environment assessment licence fees states that, “the Minister may, by statutory instrument prescribe fees for licences issued under this Act” without providing any formula (Government of Sierra Leone, 2008 : 16). The lack of clarity in this law has resulted in the EPA prescribing what has been described as “exorbitant fees” that are destroying the country’s mining industry, especially the small-scale mining sector.8  8 Interview with Independent Mining Consultant, 11 January 2017, Freetown; Interview with senior official of the National Minerals Agency, 4 February 2017, Freetown.   Whereas the cost of a small-scale mining licence charged by the NMA is US$ 800 per hectare and the maximum area of a small-scale operation is a square kilometre, which costs US$ 80,000, the EPA sometimes charges additional fees that are as much as US$ 60,000 for a similar area of operation, making it difficult, if not impossible for small-scale mining companies to raise the required fees.9  9 Interview with the Chief Mines Inspector, National Minerals Agency, 5 January 2017, Freetown.   Although the EPA has argued that environmental assessment fees are calculated based on the potential environmental footprints of prospective small-scale miners,10  10 Interview with the Executive Chairperson, EPA, 12 January 2017, Freetown.   when compared with neighbouring Liberia, which Sierra Leone must compete with to attract investment, the fees are very high. In Liberia, the fees charged to a small-scale mining company would not amount to more than US$ 10,000 per annum, regardless of the scale of operation.11  11 Interview with Assistant Manager, Environmental and Social Impact Assessment, Department of Compliance, EPA, 27 April 2017, Monrovia.   In Sierra Leone, the impact of the high environmental assessment fees charged by the EPA on the small-scale sector has been damaging. The immediate impact has been that the number of small-scale mining licences dropped from 40 in 2009, to 4 in early 2017, with officials citing the high costs of the environmental assessment fees as the main reason.12  12 Interview with the Chief Mines Inspector, National Minerals Agency, 5 January 2017, Freetown; Interview with Director of Mines, National Minerals Agency, 6 February 2017, Freetown; Interview with Independent Mining Consultant, 11 January 2017, Freetown.   In fact, at the time of our fieldwork, there was only one active small-scale diamond mining company operating in the country. These high costs have forced prospective small-scale miners to redirect their investments to artisanal mining activities, where environmental assessment fees are not required, while retaining the operational methods prevalent in the small-scale sector, such as the use of excavators and heavy machinery.13  13 Interview with the Regional Manager, National Minerals Agency, 16 January 2017, Koidu.   The result of this shift has been the emergence of new hybrid category of mining that is neither artisanal, nor small-scale. Such activities rely on artisanal mining licences for their legality, but adopt small-scale mining practices for their operations. This new system of extraction has also facilitated the continuing dominance of artisanal mining by local and national elites, but now with the introduction of foreign capital in a sector that has historically been restricted to the participation of Sierra Leoneans.14  14 Interview with the Regional Manager, National Minerals Agency, 16 January 2017, Koidu.   The “exorbitant” environmental assessment fees charged by the EPA have indirectly posed what is perhaps one of the biggest threats to the sustainability of artisanal mining: the loss of thousands of jobs and the acceleration of environmental degradation, which have stifled the possibility for ASM to contribute positively to SDG 8 (Decent Work) or SDG 15 (Life on Land and Protecting Terrestrial Ecosystems). As small-scale miners have redirected their machinery to artisanal operations and dislodged a large labour force using rudimentary extraction methods, it has put the livelihoods of thousands of artisanal miners and their dependants at risk, challenging the ability of the sector to address SDG 1 (End Poverty) and SDG 5 (Gender Equality). At the same time, the rate of mineral extraction and indeed the depletion of key deposits, has also intensified significantly.15  15 Focus group discussions with miners and diggers, January–May 2017, Seidu.   At one artisanal mining site that the researchers visited during their fieldwork, there were 10 excavators in operation, each of which cost US$ 1200 to operate per day, an amount that typical artisanal miners cannot afford without the injection of external capital.16  16 Interview with artisanal mining site manager, 21 March 2017, Seidu.   Although the authorities, including the NMA and EPA, are aware of the widespread prevalence of heavy machinery in artisanal mining licenced sites17  17 Interview with the Regional Manager, National Minerals Agency, 16 January 2017, Koidu; Interview with Regional Manager, EPA Kono, 27 February 2017, Kono.   they have proved either unwilling, or incapable of preventing their use. Consequently, the recently approved “Artisanal Mining Policy for Sierra Leone 2018” anticipates that the legal definition of artisanal mining will need to be reviewed to provide for the legal use of heavy machinery in the sector. As the policy states:Given the emerging reality of depleting alluvial deposits of diamonds and gold, there has been an increase use of excavators and washing plants by artisanal mineral rights holders; a practice that is clearly in violation of the law. In relation to other countries where the use of machinery is permitted in artisanal mining operations, there is a need for the review of the legal definition of artisanal mining in Sierra Leone (Government of Sierra Leone, 2018: 14 ).   Nonetheless, it would appear from the new Artisanal Mining Policy that the GoSL’s understanding of the reasons for the widespread use of heavy machinery in artisanal mining is limited. Moreover, the Government’s decision to actively consider the introduction of special permits for the use of machines has been based on anecdotal evidence adduced mainly by Lebanese exporters, who have attributed the drop in diamond export revenues to the recent stringent enforcement of environmental regulations limiting their use.18  18 Interview with Senior Officials, National Minerals Agency, 14 & 15 March 2019, Freetown.   Although this strategy enhances the financial prospects of a Government badly in need of revenues to pay for its programmes in the short-term, it however conflicts with the rationale of the new Artisanal Mining Policy, which prioritises livelihoods as one of its key components (Government of Sierra Leone, 2018 ). By and large, legalizing the use of excavating machines is bound to benefit the government and elite actors more than artisanal miners, whose long-term livelihoods will be severely threatened. In fact, the new policy will play directly into the hands of those who should otherwise be operating in the small-scale mining sector. But in addition to the high cost of environmental assessment fees which, as we have seen, has pushed small-scale miners towards artisanal mining, there is another provision in the MMA 2009 that has also indirectly increased the number of artisanal operations, which would have otherwise been considered small-scale. Section 139 of the MMA 2009 states that in addition to voluntary corporate social responsibility programmes, small-scale operations, like large-scale mining companies, are legally required “…to have and implement a community development agreement with the primary host community…” (GoSL, 2009: 106 ), which invariably increases their operation costs.19  19 Also see, GoSL (2012) ; Conteh and Maconachie (2019) ; Dupuy (2014) .   Thus, even without high environmental assessment fees levied by the EPA, new provisions in the law, such as the requirement for small-scale mining companies to implement community development agreements with host communities, serve as disincentives for mining operations to be registered as small-scale companies, with the obvious alternative being the artisanal mining sector.  4 The pitfalls of a bifurcated artisanal mining licencing system Nowhere have the simultaneous processes of continuity and change manifested themselves more readily than in the everyday administration of the artisanal mining sector. A recent World Bank funded project which led to the creation of the NMA, as well as the demerging of the policy implementation functions from those of policy formulation, saw Ministry of Mines and Minerals Resources operational staff transferred to the NMA. In doing so, moribund offices which housed regional staff were rehabilitated and furnished with modern equipment. However, little effort was made to do away with the bifurcated artisanal mining licencing regime, within which the NMA and Chieftaincy structures play mutually beneficial roles. The failure of the authorities to harmonise this decades’ old arrangement is not unconnected to long running processes of political bargaining and accommodation involving national politicians and Chiefs on the one hand (Tangri, 1978 , 1980 ; Conteh, 2017 ), and the country’s land tenure system on the other hand. In order to appreciate the embedded nature of duality in the licencing process, it is important to understand the processes facilitated by the NMA on the one hand, and Chiefs on the other. According to the NMA Regional Manager in Kono District, on average, the processing time for an artisanal mining licence is 14 days. First, the licence application is examined by an Area Superintendent, ensuring that it is in line with the NMA’s requirements.20  20 Interview with Regional Manager, National Minerals Agency, 16 January 2017, Koidu.   The Superintendent will then send the application to the Area Engineer, who with the use of GIS, will verify that the mining site in question is not contested. If the Engineer is satisfied, the application will then be sent to the Cadastre Clerk, who will process it and forward it on to the Manager with a payment order. Once the application is approved by the Manager, the applicant will then pay a non-refundable fee of Leones 770,000 (US$ 88) into the NMA bank account, and a fee of Leones 396,000 (US$ 44) into the account of the National Revenue Authority.21  21 Interview with Regional Manager, National Minerals Agency, 16 January 2017, Koidu.   Discussions with miners revealed substantial improvements in the artisanal mining licencing process, compared with the pre-NMA days, and no miner reported having been asked to pay informal fees by NMA staff.22  22 Focus group discussions with artisanal miners, January – May 2017, Kono.   However, as organized as the NMA licencing regime might appear, it is not without its weaknesses. Reports suggest that there have been long delays in the processing of licences, as well as allegations that the country’s complex political dynamics have sometimes influenced the licencing process. For example, one Paramount Chief who had “difficulties” securing his licences noted that, “there’s so much delay in issuing the licences…I’ve paid them Leones 15 million for 10 licences, they have only given me four, and it has taken over two years now”.23  23 Interview with a Paramount Chief, 23 January 2017, Koidu.   When asked what was responsible for the delay, he noted that “politics have interfered in a lot of things. They perceive me to be supporting the opposition”.24  24 Interview with a Paramount Chief, 23 January 2017, Koidu.   The claim of the Chief raises a number of questions including what the law and policies prescribe in relation to the number of licences an artisanal miner is allowed to operate, the independence of the NMA, as well as the level of discretion that can be exercised by its officials at the local level. Although the MMA 2009 is silent on the number of artisanal licences a miner can hold at one time, officials have often used their discretion to limit this to five, except for Chiefs, who given their privileged position, can have as many licences as they can afford. Thus, the fact that no explanation was given for the delay in the processing of his application, made the Chief suspicious. However, the Chief’s claim is not without some merit. Other studies have reported similar findings on how members of the political class who fall out of favour with their peers can be excluded and punished in overt and sometimes subtle ways (Conteh, 2017 ; Conteh and Maconachie, 2019 ). In addition to delays in the processing of artisanal mining licences and the influence politics play in such processes, what takes place at the NMA is reliant on the number of licence applications it receives from the Chiefdoms, where the process of applying for an artisanal mining licence actually starts. In other words, the NMA cannot commence the registration of artisanal mining claims without the approval of Chiefs, who preside over a pre-NMA licencing system based on the ownership of land, but with significant flaws and opportunities for abuse. The role that Chiefs play in the artisanal mining licence process, is underscored by the distinction that has been made between the ownership of surface rights over land, and the rights over the minerals beneath them. Whereas all minerals belong to the state, surface rights are owned by land owning families, with Chiefs acting as custodians of such lands (Renner-Thomas, 2010 ; Njoh and Akiwumi, 2012 ; Ryan, 2018 ; Conteh and Maconachie, 2019 ). Thus, miners are required to obtain surface rent certificates indicating Chiefs’ approval of their planned operations, and proof that the proposed mining sites are not the subject of contested claims, or prohibited areas, before they can proceed to the NMA. The manner in which Chiefs preside over this system has been the subject of numerous allegations of abuse and irregularities. First, it is not clear how much miners should pay for surface rents within, and across Chiefdoms, which increases the chance of them being extorted. To address this challenge, the Ministry of Mines, which is responsible for mining policy, is actively considering the harmonization of surface rents across the country.25  25 Discussions with the Policy Advisor, Ministry of Mines and Mineral Resources, 18 March 2018, Freetown.   While harmonization would be an important step in restoring predictability to surface rent payments, it nonetheless does not take into account the relative differences between Chiefdoms in relation to their need for revenue and natural resource endowment. This is amplified by the fact that the probability of a miner discovering diamonds will be higher in some Chiefdoms than in others. Further, the impact of politics on the role that Chiefs play in the licencing process has been more pronounced than that occurring in the process managed by the NMA. Given that they are far removed from the scrutiny of the formal state, Chiefs have frequently used the authority granted them to issue out surface rent certificates to prospective miners, to settle political scores and to punish their opponents. During fieldwork, several miners and officials recounted stories of Chiefs abusing their authority in the granting of surface rent certificates, but one incident clearly stood out. As the Regional Manager of the NMA noted:There was a case in which a Paramount Chief refused to sign 20 artisanal mining licence forms because he said his ancestors and those of the applicant had issues. So he was not going to sign, saying that he was the custodian of the land. As long as he [the Chief] refuses to give consent, then the NMA cannot be involved.26  26 Interview with Regional Manager, National Minerals Agency, 16 January 2017, Koidu.     Even in such clear cases of flagrant power abuse, officials of the NMA remain unwilling to intervene, as they regard their role as purely technical in nature, even if politics often interferes with it. This unwillingness to get involved is compounded by the fear of losing their jobs, and the unpredictable reactions of political patrons from whom the respective parties would draw support should the conflict escalate. According to one Senior official of the NMA, “…it is enough to allow them to settle the issue for themselves”.27  27 Interview with Regional Manager, National Minerals Agency, 16 January 2017, Koidu.   In addition to Chiefs’ abuse of the surface rent certification scheme, the Diamond Area Community Development Fund (DACDF), an initiative introduced by the GoSL in 2001 to redistribute a small portion of diamond exports to mining communities for local development, has also produced some adverse and unintended outcomes (Maconachie, 2010 , 2009 , 2012 ; Dupuy, 2014 ). Although the overall objectives of the DACDF are well intentioned, and the potential for the fund to contribute to meeting SDG targets in mining communities is significant, underlying power issues continue to shape its administration at the local level. For example, although a Chiefdom’s DACDF allocation is based on the number of artisanal mining licences registered with the NMA, civil society activists campaigning for transparency in the mining sector have discovered that there is a substantially higher number of surface rent certificates in the various mining Chiefdoms of Kono, than artisanal mining licences registered with the NMA.28  28 Interview with Chairman, Campaign for Just Mining Kono District, 16 January 2017, Koidu.   This anomaly is due to the fact that Chiefs are less inclined to encourage miners to proceed to the NMA to obtain a licence, given that the money they receive from surface rent payments is likely to be higher than the annual DACDF allocation they would receive from the GoSL. This is perhaps unsurprising, given that not every miner who obtains a surface rent certificate will proceed to the next stage to secure a licence from the NMA, even though it is relatively inexpensive to do so. Although the surface rent certification is only intended to demonstrate to the NMA that the Chiefs have given their consent for the prospective miners to mine the land, in such situations it is regarded as a “temporary licence”. A similar phenomenon has been reported in Liberia, where miners regard the Clearance permit, which is in theory an order for them to proceed to registering their claims in Monrovia, as a temporary “licence” that allows them to work and raise the necessary fees that can then be used to register (Hilson and Van Bockstael, 2011 ; 2012 ; Van Bockstael, 2014 ). The net effect of the challenges outlined above, including the contradictory laws and bifurcated licencing process, has been entrenched and persistent informality in the artisanal and small-scale mining sector, an issue that is the focus of the next section.  5 The persistence of informality in artisanal mining Although NMA officials have contested claims of persistent informality in the artisanal and small-scale mining sector, given the agency’s rather simplistic characterization of formalization to mean the decentralization of licencing processes,29  29 Interview with Chief Mines Inspector, National Minerals Agency, 5 January 2017, Freetown.   it is not difficult for one to observe high levels of informality in the sector. In fact, one donor official critical in the NMA argued that:The Ministry of Mines has always had regional offices so they [the NMA] haven’t decentralized that much since they took over from the Ministry…For me what is important is what happens before the licence application reaches the NMA, and nobody is looking at that”.30  30 Interview with donor official, 17 February 2017, Freetown.     Indeed, as already established above, while the NMA is a “decentralized” agency, it remains largely “suspended” and “floating” over Chiefdoms where it has not been able to effectively penetrate, given its aversion to getting involved in politics. However, in addition to the NMA’s reluctance to be drawn into politics, there are even more substantive factors that have facilitated informality in the sector. First, the NMA’s staffing capacities are severely limited. At the time of fieldwork, the agency had over 500 Mines Monitoring Officers (MMOs) to monitor an estimated 300,000 artisanal miners across the country, but only 170 were verified and paid by the Ministry of Finance.31  31 Interview with Chief Mines Inspector, National Minerals Agency, 5 January 2017, Freetown.   The agency inherited the MMO system from the Ministry of Mines, and with this came 330 unofficial “appointed” monitors who mainly constituted supporters of powerful politicians of the ruling party. The salaries of MMOs are not only low, but they can sometimes go for as long as 16 months without getting paid (Sierra Express Media, 2014 ). It is therefore not surprising that MMOs have been frequently accused of colluding with miners who engage in illegal mining. Whereas senior NMA officials and civil society activists are aware of the difficulties posed by badly remunerated MMOs and their activities, they have taken a rather altruistic stance. As one of them noted, “MMOs connive with miners. Even though we don’t approve of what they do, one can understand why they do so”.32  32 Interview with Chairman, Campaign for Just Mining Kono District, 16 January 2017, Koidu.   In late 2018, the NMA moved to reform and rebrand the mines monitoring scheme, by terminating the contract of all officers as well as changing their designation to ‘Mines Compliance Officers’ (MCO). It is unclear what difference will result from this change, but civil society activists are already alleging that, many, if not all of the new MCOs, are loyal supporters of the ruling party, as was the case of those before them.33  33 Interview with Chairman, Campaign for Just Mining Kono District, 4 March 2019, Koidu.   Further to the limited and politicized staff capacity of the NMA, there is considerable evidence to suggest that Chiefs have also been major facilitators of illegal mining activities in their Chiefdoms. As one senior NMA official observed:Wherever there is illegal mining, the Chiefs are involved, and they do so with the landowners. For example, one of them allowed a Chinese small–scale mining company to mine in his Chiefdom without a licence from the NMA, for months. When we discovered the operations, his argument was that he’s the custodian of the law.34  34 Interview with Chief Mines Inspector, National Minerals Agency, 5 January 2017, Freetown.     The act of Chiefs turning a blind eye to illegal mining activities is not new. As Jackson pointed out immediately after the civil war, “it seems highly unlikely that many Chiefs would be unaware of the large numbers of mechanical mining machinery digging up their land” (Jackson, 2005 : 54). As already discussed above in relation to Chiefs’ issuance of surface rent certificates, their incentive lies in the fact that, “they can make more money through illegal operations wherein they directly receive payments from illegal operators, than through funds paid into the DACDF, because everyone in the Chiefdom knows about it”.35  35 Interview with Chairman, Campaign for Just Mining Kono District, 16 January 2017, Koidu.   The argument being made here is not that the DACDF is no longer a major source of revenue for Chiefs, but rather that the increasing scrutiny by civil society that has accompanied the payment of the fund in recent years, has led Chiefs to look elsewhere for new sources of income, even if it means breaking the law and depriving the state of revenue. In a meeting with Paramount Chiefs in July 2018, the President “disclosed that he is in possession of documents that have been issued by local authorities (Chiefs) to business people permitting large scale mining of gold and diamonds”, and warned them to stop or face the law (African Young Voices, 2018 ). The extent to which the President’s warning will deter Chiefs from being involved in illegal mining activities is unclear, given that the practice is far reaching and entrenched. In fact, it is not only the Chiefs that have been involved in illicit activities. Jackson (2005)  documented the case of a former Minister of Transport, Momoh Pujeh, who was arrested by the Anti-Corruption Commission, “for illegal diamond dealing” (2005: 54 ). Moreover, more recently, in a case that shocked residents and brought the city of Koidu to near chaos in July 2016, the Regional Minister East, Karamoh Kabbah, presided over the illegal mining of the Congo Bridge which linked the city with the rest of the country. The land under the bridge remained one of the few sites in the area to have escaped mining activities, and was rumoured to contain rich alluvial diamond deposits.36  36 Interviews with the Regional Manager, Environment Protection Agency, 27 February 2017, Koidu; Regional Manager, National Minerals Agency, 16 January 2017, Koidu.   Despite considerable protest from the Regional Managers of the NMA and EPA, as well as demonstrations staged by residents for the operation to be stopped, the bridge was completely mined with support from an Israeli business man, Max Pluto, who provided excavators for the exercise.37  37 Interviews with the Regional Manager, Environment Protection Agency, 27 February 2017, Koidu; Regional Manager, National Minerals Agency, 16 January 2017, Koidu.   Given the nature of power relations in Sierra Leone, the level of negative publicity generated by the Minister’s actions, and the impunity with which he conducted the operation, it is clear that he could not have done so without the full, or tacit, approval of his bosses in Freetown.38  38 Interview with Chairman, Campaign for Just Mining Kono District, 16 January 2017, Koidu.   The fact that the representatives of the mining and environmental regulators were unable to stop an illicit mining operation that was in full public display, is indicative of their powerlessness in the face of determined politicians willing to break the law in their pursuit of wealth. It also demonstrates that the setting up of institutions to ensure the social and environmental sustainability of mining is meaningless, unless politicians are willing to allow them to carry out their functions independently.  6 Conclusion As we have seen, the governance of Sierra Leone’s artisanal and small-scale mining sector has evolved considerably since the end of the country’s conflict, in large part due to a set of reform interventions carried out by the government, donors and NGOs (Engwicht, 2016 ). Such interventions have played a role in helping the country shrug off its unenviable image of being a theatre of resource-induced violence, that was typified in the 2006 movie, “Blood Diamond”. From the redistribution of mining revenues to diamond mining Chiefdoms through the DACDF, to the demerging of policy implementation functions from those of policy formulation that led to the creation of the NMA, the country has made significant progress in carrying out difficult reforms which could help the government meet a number of targets linked to the UN SDGs. However, some of these reforms have in the process threatened the elite’s traditional control over the diamond trade and its networks. The creation of the NMA, in particular, is no mean achievement given the resistance put up by Ministry of Mines and Mineral Resources officials who stood to lose from the process. In neighbouring Liberia, with which Sierra Leone is currently working to harmonize mining policies, such a move to demerge both functions, has been completely taken off the table. In fact, the various laws that have brought about changes in the institutional arrangements, including the creation of the EPA and the NMA, represent significant steps forward in the regulation of the sector. However, on balance, one can also observe significant levels of continuities, with the old “order” constantly reproducing itself within the context of ongoing reforms, resulting in hybridized outcomes. While old laws have been repealed and new ones enacted, they have either been inadequate, or conflictual, in ways that would appear instrumental to the elite, who have learned to adjust themselves to demands by donors for reforms. Although there is little doubt that the NMA and the EPA represent two small pockets of effectiveness in Sierra Leone’s formalization architecture, when tested politically, they have proven to be weak as was clearly the case in the illegal mining operations carried out on the Congo Bridge in 2016. Amidst the difficult concessions made by the Government in establishing professional and stand-alone agencies responsible for the regulation of mining and the environment, it has stuck to the bifurcated artisanal mining licencing arrangement, by not disrobing the Chieftaincy of its long-held privilege of managing processes in relation to the disposal of land in diamondiferous areas. Thus, what officials give away in processes of reforms, they eventually regain in processes of continuity in what appears to be a game of “back and forth” movements. While the ideal form of formalization of artisanal and small-scale mining will involve wide ranging policy actions including training for miners, sustainable lines of credit, decentralization of licencing regimes and taxation, in the case of Sierra Leone, rationalizing the current dual system involving the NMA and Chiefs, will be a major success in itself. In international policy-making circles, there is now widespread recognition that the sustainable management of mineral resources is closely linked to global development trajectories, but also to the sustainability of local livelihoods and the achievement of the UN Agenda 2030 and the SDGs. However most often, discussions that concern artisanal mining and the SDGs fail to recognise the importance of the political landscape, underlying governance issues, or local-level power asymmetries. The future sustainability of the artisanal mining sector must therefore involve reforms that address these power imbalances by strengthening the capacity of regulators to support miners with training and credit, as well as allow them to operate independently. On the whole, Sierra Leone’s new Artisanal Mining Policy represents a promising start, even if its provisions for the mechanization of the artisanal mining sub-sector remain problematic in the face of limited evidence to support such a process. Ultimately, however, implementing and sustaining reforms in the artisanal mining sector will require more powerful actors to adopt a long-term approach that does not prioritize the short-term goal of revenue generation for self-enrichment, over the livelihoods of miners themselves. This is particularly important in countries such as Sierra Leone, where artisanal mining largely remains the backbone of the rural economy. Underlying all of this, is the task of dismantling the informal processes which continue to serve elites and allow them to maintain the status quo. Only then will it truly be possible for sustainable mining reforms to be liked to broader development initiatives, such as attaining the SDGs.
