                  The post-2015 sustainable development goals (SDGs) aim to strengthen the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). There are 17 SDGs, the first two tackle ending poverty and hunger as well as food insecurity, under nutrition and sustainable agriculture. To address these goals requires eradicating chronic hunger. This paper examines challenges associated with biofuel production and how they relate to SDGs and their targets. We mainly focus on challenges associated with biofuel production not adequately addressed in the SDGs. It draws from a range of peer reviewed and grey literature to advance the understanding of how biofuel production will impact the post-2015 development agenda. The findings suggest that increasing use of food crops to produce biofuels in the United States, European Union, Japan and Brazil has been one important element in explaining the steady rise in staple food prices since 2000. While this is a potential threat to food and nutrition security in low and middle-income countries, biofuel production also offers significant opportunities in low income countries. There are several challenges to the development and harnessing of biofuels, these include 1) the interaction between biofuel production and climate change; 2) biofuel production and foreignisation of land; 3) food wastage; 4) poor governance and limited production capacity; 5) biofuel production within a weak and fragmented policy framework; 6) biofuel production, land tenure, and socio-economic impacts; 7) biofuel production and conflicts; and 8) biofuel production and deforestation. For the post-2015 sustainable development agenda to have an impact, strong actions are required to protect rural communities as well as nurture the biofuels industry. This should be matched by commensurate investments in food and nutrition security, and transparent public–private partnerships. This calls for strong and pro-poor policies on feedstock farming, processing and trading. Such policies must address the rhetoric of stakeholder participation in land use management.

Table 3 Source: Extracted from [32]      Sustainability challenge  First generation (1G)  Second generation (2G)  Policy challenges    Food security Negative impact on food security is the biggest concern raised about using food crops and oils for producing fuel (‘food vs. fuel’). May be relevant for non-food energy crops if grown on land having value for food production, including lignocellulose sourced from the global South Biofuel can help ameliorate food price rises linked to fuel and fertiliser price rises   Precise role of 1G biofuels in food price spikes contested Use of agricultural residues would not constitute a direct conflict with food (but questions may arise where biofuel production using residues is linked with 1G feedstocks) The efficacy of re-using marketable by-products and residues of bioethanol production relative to other methods for improving soil fertility should be considered    Residues such as straw may be part of the animal feed mix and thus indirectly linked to the food chain Use of land for grazing or animal feed could also be independently assessed Sustainability of land use is a ‘wicked’ problem that extends beyond debates on the sustainability of agriculture to raise broader questions about land use and management practices as a whole  Large-scale land acquisition Where land has been acquired for sourcing biomass from global South, violations have been reported of people's rights and livelihoods Land officially designated as ‘marginal’ or degraded, but suitable for 2G feedstocks, may be relied on by the poor for subsistence. Reliable monitoring of land acquisition in developing countries may be difficult given major disparities between large companies and local people  For agricultural residues, the sustainable use of land in which the crop is grown may be relevant   LUC of natural habitats and other ecologically valuable land acquired for biofuel plantations has been linked to loss of biodiversity Biofuel companies may target higher quality agricultural land or forested land that will provide additional income from logging, and intensification can further exacerbate ecological impacts Relative priorities for different uses of land may differ according to different communal or cultural value sets, or the uneven distribution of climate change impacts, and need to be considered in all parts of the world  greenhouse gas (GHG) balance Indirect land use change (iLUC) effects including the release of carbon stocks from conversion of forests, peatlands or grasslands for biofuel crops will reduce carbon savings. If feedstocks were sourced by felling of forests, or where the use of ‘marginal’ land which is in fact a source of food stimulates iLUC effects, GHG balance may be questioned Given complexity of iLUC and its relevance to agriculture as a whole, deforestation may be more reliably addressed through dedicated policies rather than inclusion in GHG calculations for biofuels   Impact of nitrogen fertilizers and energy costs of transporting feedstocks can affect net energy balance. Soil organic carbon content is affected by removal of straw. Results of calculations depend on system boundaries and assumptions which need to be explicit to avoid misuse by decision-makers   Most conventional biofuels depend on fossil fuels for their production Net energy balance is relevant given the energy inputs needed to break down lignocellulosic material and for transportation of bulky residues    Carbon calculators used to test GHG emissions show large differences, mainly due to how emissions from fertiliser manufacture and application are accounted for and whether LUC is excluded or incompletely calculated Although, cellulosic ethanol requires less fossil fuels for process heat and electricity than starch-based ethanol   Biofuel producers may select a carbon calculator that generates the greatest GHG savings (differences in emission factors yield different results) to comply with sustainability criteria  Environmental impacts Biodiversity and water preservation are seen as ‘grand challenges’ with far-reaching social ramifications. Perennial biofuel crops can improve biodiversity and water quality due to the reduced requirement for nitrogen fertiliser and pesticide inputs; but slow-growing crops may affect groundwater recharge and require constant access to water Whole system water usage needs to be investigated (ideally across agriculture as a whole)   Concerns about the impacts of monocultures for biofuels on biodiversity and water conservation, especially linked to the conversion of natural terrestrial ecosystems, are not new Biodiversity and water impacts remain a concern: high-yielding food crops grown for their coproducts and residues will use disproportionately more water while marginal or degraded land or land formerly under the EU set-aside scheme may be targeted for monoculture biofuel crops. Research on biofuel crop breed varieties that protect ecosystem services is ongoing, but differences between performance in laboratory conditions and ecological conditions in situ will need to be considered.    Whole chain water use a concern (especially where 2G processing techniques are particularly water intensive) Efforts to balance ecosystem services to preserve biodiversity are not new in UK agricultural systems, however LUC impacts in the UK and abroad will add to policy complexity     Impacts tend to be location-specific, so distribution of risks is an issue: yet impact assessments on biodiversity and water are constrained by considerable uncertainties including geospatial differentiation, different types of water and evapotranspiration.  Other local impacts Intensification of biofuel crops has been linked to long-term loss of livelihoods and local food/energy production through displacement of local subsistence farmers and negative ecological impacts The visual impact of biomass (e.g., tall-growing miscanthus) and biomass plants on the landscape may be a factor, depending on the location. Siting decisions for biofuel production facilities need to consider these local impacts, preferably in (early) consultation with the local community.   Biomass plants can have a negative impact on local air quality through processing and transport emissions and on the aesthetics of the local landscape. Processing and transport emissions remain a concern. Understanding how public perceptions are shaped by broader social, cultural and personal meanings and assessments of biofuel developments can help to develop more robust policy decisions, and social science can help in this regard.     Box 1 Types of Biofuels.  Table   Generation  Description    First generation biofuel [62,166]  The first generation biofuels are based on the transesterification or simply the chemical conversion of oils (vegetable oil and animal fats) to produce biodiesel and the fermentation of starch and sugar to produce bioethanol or butanol. The most commonly used feedstocks include animal fats, vegetable oils, oily seeds such as soybean, rapeseed, mustard or sunflower, well as starch crops such as maize, sugarcane, sorghum, or cassava  Second generation biofuels [17]  These are based on the biochemical or thermochemical processes to convert agricultural lignocellulosic biomass to fuels. Lignocellulosic feedstocks for second generation biofuels include by-products (cereal straw, sugar cane bagasse, forest residues), wastes (organic components of municipal solid wastes such as landfills), and dedicated feedstocks (purpose-grown vegetative grasses, short rotation forests and other energy crops  Third generation biofuels [62]  These are based on microbiological processes of species such as yeast, fungi and microalgae and the genetic engineering of algae biomass and other acquatic biomass sources, chemical treatment bio-oil extract from algae and pyrolysis of algae cultures. The list of fuels that can be derived from algae includes biodiesel, bioethanol, biogases, and jet fuel  Fourth generation biofuels [92,166]  These are based on petroleum-like hydroprocessing, oxy-fuel combustion or thermochemical processes and focus on genetically optimized feedstocks geared towards capturing and storing carbon at the feedstock level and during processing technology           Biofuel production and its impact on food security in low and middle income countries: Implications for the post-2015 sustainable development goals Andre M.N.

There are 17 SDGs, the first two tackle ending poverty and hunger as well as food insecurity, under nutrition and sustainable agriculture. To address these goals requires eradicating chronic hunger. This paper examines challenges associated with biofuel production and how they relate to SDGs and their targets. We mainly focus on challenges associated with biofuel production not adequately addressed in the SDGs. It draws from a range of peer reviewed and grey literature to advance the understanding of how biofuel production will impact the post-2015 development agenda. The findings suggest that increasing use of food crops to produce biofuels in the United States, European Union, Japan and Brazil has been one important element in explaining the steady rise in staple food prices since 2000. While this is a potential threat to food and nutrition security in low and middle-income countries, biofuel production also offers significant opportunities in low income countries. There are several challenges to the development and harnessing of biofuels, these include 1) the interaction between biofuel production and climate change; 2) biofuel production and foreignisation of land; 3) food wastage; 4) poor governance and limited production capacity; 5) biofuel production within a weak and fragmented policy framework; 6) biofuel production, land tenure, and socio-economic impacts; 7) biofuel production and conflicts; and 8) biofuel production and deforestation. For the post-2015 sustainable development agenda to have an impact, strong actions are required to protect rural communities as well as nurture the biofuels industry. This should be matched by commensurate investments in food and nutrition security, and transparent public–private partnerships. This calls for strong and pro-poor policies on feedstock farming, processing and trading. Such policies must address the rhetoric of stakeholder participation in land use management.   Keywords Food insecurity and hunger  Sustainable development goals  Biofuels  Low and middle income countries  Land grabbing  Land policy    1 Introduction The “transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” is a resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 25 September 2015 (A/70/L.1). [1] . The resolution outlines 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs), and the potential of biofuel production to contribute towards meeting the SGDs is strong, especially its contribution to energy security; climate change mitigation; and poverty alleviation through increased economic activity, income generation and diversification, and investments in agricultural production systems [2,3] . However, there are also unintended negative impacts of biofuel production on land (land quality, land tenure, and land rights), water and biodiversity, food security, and market opportunities ( Table 1 ). Despite the institutional, social, economic, and environmental impacts of biofuel production, studies examining the potential contribution to the SDGs are lacking. Most available studies and reviews have focused on the machinery and application of biofuel production [4–11] ; the overall main environmental, and socio-economic impacts of biofuel production [12–14] ; and policy implications at local, national and international levels [15–21] . Therefore, in this paper we examine challenges associated with biofuel production and how they relate to SDGs and their targets. We mainly focus on challenges associated with biofuel production not adequately addressed in the SDGs.  2 Historical and contextual background While the food vs. fuel argument will continue to divide the international community, its policy relevance and negative impact on food security has been taken for granted at high-level political for a on sustainable development. Yet, hunger and undernutrition in low and middle income countries (LMICs) have continued to be a subject for concern for the international community since the 1960s [22] . Perhaps the most important and concrete high-level political forum to address hunger was the 1996 World Food Summit (WFS) in Rome, the result of which was the Rome Declaration on World Food Security in which 182 governments committed to “… eradicate hunger in all countries, with an immediate view to reducing the number of undernourished people to half their present level no later than 2015 ” [23] . As a follow-up, the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were proposed in 2000 and outlined eight goals which were endorsed by all 189 United Nations member states at the time. The first MDG focused on eradicating extreme poverty and hunger and among its targets was to “halve, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of people who suffer from hunger ” as measured by the prevalence of underweight among children under five years of age and the proportion of population with hunger (chronic undernourishment) or below minimum level of dietary energy consumption [24] . Progress of the above initiatives has been monitored through the “State of Food Insecurity in the World” annual reports by the FAO and the annual MDGs Report by the United Nations. The year 2015 marked the end of the monitoring period for the internationally agreed targets for hunger reduction [25] . The number of people who are undernourished worldwide decreased from 1011 million in 1990 and 930 million in 2000 to about 795 million people in 2015 [24] . The prevalence of undernourishment declined from 18.6% in 1990 and 14.9% in 2000 to 10.9% in 2015 worldwide; and from 23.3% in 1990 and 18.2% in 2000 to 12.9% in 2015 for the developing regions. The prevalence of underweight among children under five years of age followed a similar pattern, decreasing from 27.4% in 1990 to 16.6% in 2013 in the developing regions of the world [25] . Stunting, which represents cumulative hunger and inadequate nutrition over a long period and/or an exposure to repeated infections, remains a significant public health challenge. The overall prevalence of stunting remains significantly high and has recorded a steady decline over the MDG monitoring period, from 40% in 1990 to 25% in 2013 [26] , and from 60% to 38% in least developed countries and from 48% to 38% and in sub-Saharan Africa [27] . Although these data are encouraging, there have been some regional variations, with great success observed in Latin America, the east and south-eastern regions of Asia, the Caucasus and Central Asia, and the northern region of Africa. However, southern Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Oceania recorded modest progress, and the progress was too slow to reach the MDG target of halving the proportion of the chronically undernourished [25,28] . It is interesting to note that, out of the 129 developing countries for which monitoring data are available, only a total of 72 (55.8%) reached the hunger target of the MDGs and 29 (22.5%) reached the WFS targets [25] . Lessons learned from monitoring the MDG targets suggest that countries that have met the hunger targets had several things in common: stable political conditions, economic growth, social protection policies and sound food security and nutrition policies [25] . However, there are two important issues that are often neglected and have impacted negatively on the MDGs and, if not addressed, will equally impact negatively on the post-2015 sustainable development goals. These include poor governance (e.g. corruption, mismanagement, or economic irrationality) and policy neglect (e.g. neglectful of core public issues) [29] . At the Rio+20 Conference one of the outcomes was to launch a process for developing sustainable development goals (SDGs), which form the cornerstones of the post-2015 development agenda that was adopted by the United Nations Summit on 25–27 September 2015 in New York. The SDGs have 17 Goals with 169 associated targets. The second goal of the SDGs is “End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture ” [1] . The goal has five targets and three means of implementation. Target 2.2 states “by 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older person ” [1] . Firstly, ending hunger (Target 2.1) and all form of malnutrition (Target 2.2.) by 2030 are more like moral aspirational imperatives and over-ambitious targets and they would be impossible to achieve given the historical annual rate of reducing stunting, wasting, and underweight [30] . Secondly, Target 2.2 is confusing and contradictory in targets and timeline, that is, ending all forms of malnutrition by 2030 vs. achieving the internationally agreed targets by 2025 [31] . Finally, ending all forms of undernutrition implies starting with eradicating chronic hunger and one factor that will affect efforts to address chronic hunger is bio-fuel production due to poor governance and policy neglect. These challenges are not addressed in the means of implementation for the SDGs. Biofuels are hyped as a potential solution to the global dwindling fossil fuel reserves. However, there are a number of negative outcomes associated with biofuel production and these include distorted food supplies and associated food price increases and competition for land and water [32] . By virtue of the fact that biofuels are produced from living plants and agricultural residues or waste through biological processes, their production constitutes a major threat to global food systems and the natural environment. Biofuel production can be divided into first, second, third, and fourth generation and these are summarised in  Box 1 . There has been a number of studies examining the economic, social, and health aspects of biofuel production. A quick scan of the findings suggest that the studies have covered a wide range of issues including inter alia: challenges and opportunities in the growing biofuel industry [4–8]  and in the development of alternative fuels for aviation [9–11] ; the economic, environmental, and social impacts of biofuel production [12–14] ; methodologies for estimating biomass and emissions from biofuel combustion [33,34] ; policy discourse, innovation and sustainability of biofuel production [15–18] ; the international trade of biofuels [19] ; the impact of biofuel policies on energy and food markets [20,21] ; the co-existence between biomass harvested for biofuel and grazing systems [35] ; farmers’ uptake and knowledge of and willingness to farm crops for biofuel production [36–42] ; estimating regional differences in global distribution of biomass burning [43] ; biofuel consumption rates and patterns [44,45] .; the future cost of advanced biofuels and on the potential role of research, development and demonstration efforts in reducing costs and in supporting the deployment of biofuels [46,47]  consumers’ attitudes, actions and connection between environmental policies and the use of biofuels [48] ; the health consequence of solid biofuel combustion [49–51] , impact of biofuel production on food prices and food security [52–54] , and viable crops for biofuel production and technological breakthrough that would significantly reduce production costs and accelerate diffusion [5,7,8,17,18,43,47] . The findings from the above studies suggest that the aviation biofuel industry has the potential to grow bigger. However, the commercialisation of the industry faces serious challenges. The biodiesel and bio-alcohols are not suitable alternatives for aviation fuels due to poor fuel properties. Although the use of liquid hydrogen and liquid methane fuels are better alternatives, their competitiveness.is inferior due to their high production cost and less suitability to conventional aircraft engines. Similarly, scaling up and the commercialisation of alternative aviation fuels face serious challenges related to the availability of feedstock, compatibility of alternative fuels with conventional aircraft engines, environmental concern and production and distribution issues. [9–11] . The potential for biofuel production in developed nations is high but likely to remain under target unless largescale changes in land use are rolled out and implemented. Even then, there is need to study the potential impact of largescale biofuel feedstock production especially on water and biodiversity for the industry to be fully embraced by various stakeholders [37,38] . Indeed, tensions remain between biofuel stakeholders yet not all of them inform the biofuel policies and decision making processes. Stakeholders such as consumers bear the high cost of food and fuel but are rarely consulted by the biofuels industry [12] . While governments are more interested in producing, marketing, and trading of biofuels [21] , in some states in the USA the government has been slow in harnessing the farming community to grow biofuel feedstock [37] . Therefore, farmers’willingness to engage in biofuel feedstock is foremost anchored by profitability and patriotism. The major barrier is the marketability of the feedstock as there are not enough bio refineries in the area to stimulate production. In addition, formation of farmer's cooperatives is necessary to gain the critical mass necessary to influence decisions and realise the full potential of the biofuel economy [37] . Similarly, in Iowa, a study carried out in 2011 examined farmers’ interest in harvesting and providing corn stovers for biofuel refineries. The study found that some corn farmers were concerned with the negative environmental impact associated with the corn stover removal from their farm land. However, others showed interest in the prospect [36]  In Alabama, a study carried out in 2011 found that most family forest landowners were willing to supply both timber and harvest residues for production of biofuels and their willingness was positively correlated with the number of acres owned, the existence of an effective market, and the opportunity to contribute to local economic development and global climate change [55] . In low and middle income countries, the challenges relate to the effectiveness of legal and institutional framework in managing the trade-offs of large-scale land acquisitions for biofuel feedstock expansion. For example, in Ghana, the limited awareness of the true value of land; limited foresight of the magnitude of future impacts and weak negotiation skills by traditional authorities and land users undermine the efforts to engage with the local people to leverage benefits [56] . In contrast, the India's young biofuel industry is ideal and based on sugar molasses for bioethanol and non-edible oil for biodiesel which are not in conflict with food. Bioethanol from molasses does not add further stress on land and water resources because it is a bi-product of the sugar industry. Instead it supplements the rural employment opportunities in the sugar industry. Notwithstanding the good fit, the industry has been constrained by the inconsistent supply of molasses, high production costs, limited land availability and restrictive policies which required attention for the advancement and sustainability of the industry [4] . Of all the limitations experienced by India's young biofuel industry, the constraining policy environment standout out as a major factor that required decisive and visionary leadership to achieve multiple goals in energy security, social economic factors, food security and environmental protection. Appropriate policy intervention will stimulate the industry's viability, competitiveness and sustainability [4] . There is potential for co-existence between biomass harvested for biofuel and grazing systems, but there are opportunity costs for diversion of grazing biomass for biofuel, social economic considerations and the environmental impact [35] . From an international market point of view, biofuel producers, food, and livestock are indeed competing for the same commodity crops [57] . Each generation of biofuel production has implications in terms of competition for labour, food, land, water, and forest and grasslands, all of which are closely associated with the food security.  3 Challenges associated with biofuel production not adequately addressed in the SDGs 3.1 Global food insecurity: interaction between biofuels and climate change Despite many studies showing the negative impact of biofuel production on food security, the relationship between biofuel production and food security remains a hotly contested issue [32] . The first generation biofuels have created a number of ethical dilemmas including the threat to the biodiversity due to their inability to reduce green-house gas and carbon dioxide emission and the threat to the food supplies, with increasing demand for biofuels more likely to be associated with the diversion of crops from the global food markets and subsequent increases in food prices [58–62] . Although the FAO food price index trend for five commodities namely cereal, vegetable oils, sugar, meat and dairy shows that overall food prices have been increasing since early 2000 [63] ; the increase in global food prices is not a new phenomenon and can be traced back to the 1960s [64] . However, the upward trend in food prices and volatility observed in the last decade has been closely linked with climate change, increased production of biofuels from food, increase in food production costs due to higher energy and fertilizer prices, poor harvests, national export restrictions, rising global food demand, and low food stocks [65–67] . An estimated 40% of the US maize crop is now diverted from global food markets to produce biofuel [68] . Biofuel production affects food supply and prices, with demand for biofuel food and non-food feedstocks overwhelming the food supply system. Timmer [69]  and Abbott et al. [70]  argue that the 2007/8 global food crisis was preceded by low returns (profits) on food which forced farmers to branch out and explore other options such as the conversion of food into biofuels that paid better due to high energy demand. This led to the demand for food to outmatch production and the subsequent food crisis. Nevertheless, Zhang et al. [71]  disputed that the increase in energy prices affected food prices and argued a weak correlation between food and energy (especially ethanol) prices. Climate change and biofuel production are closely related and their combined effect is leading to the abrupt shift of the balance between food supply and demand from food surplus to deficit [72] . Therefore, biofuel production affects the food supply in two ways: by increasing green gas emission and by increasing food prices (competition for food). According to Searchinger and colleagues [73] , biofuels increase greenhouse gases through emissions from land-use change. They argue that, although existing evidence emphasises reduced greenhouse gases associated with substituting biofuels for gasoline due to carbon sequestration through the growth of the feedstock, most prior studies failed to account for the carbon emissions that occur when farmers respond to higher food prices by converting forest and grassland to new cropland to replace the grain (or cropland) diverted to biofuels [73] . In their worldwide agricultural model to estimate emissions from land-use change, they found that corn-based ethanol will double greenhouse emissions over 30 years and increase greenhouse gases for 167 years. The use of witchgrass as feedstock for biofuel production will increase emissions by 50% if grown on corn lands [73] . Other studies suggest that climate change impacts on soil water balance resulting in soil evaporation and plant transpiration, the consequence of which includes shortened period of crop development and reduced yields, water scarcity, and reduced water quality [74,75] . In their model estimating the impact of increased temperature since 1980 on crop yield, Lobell and Field [76]  noted that during this period global mean temperature increased ∼0.4 °C per year and observed negative responses of global yields for maize, wheat, barley, rice, soybean, and sorghum between 1980 and 2002. In their model examining the global scale climate–yield relationships, they found that at least 29% of the variance in year-to-year yield changes was explained precipitation and temperature, with much of the model's explanatory power due precipitation for rice and soybeans and temperature for maize, wheat, barley, and sorghum. With inferred temperature sensitivities being negative for all crop, the authors projected that, since 1981, wheat, maize and barley production would have been roughly 2–3% higher in 2002 without climate trends; translating into combined losses of 40Mt or $5 billion per year for these three crops. The linkage between biofuel production, climate change, and the increase in global food prices raises a critical policy and moral challenge for countries converting food into biofuel and food production land into feedstock production land. For example, in the United states of America, biofuel production was estimated to account for 20–25% maize price increase and 7–8% soybeans price increase between 2001 and 2007 [77] . The conversion of large volumes of maize to ethanol wiped out over 30% of 2007/8 the maize harvest in the USA alone [78] , one of the leading ethanol and maize producers. In 2010, both the USA and Brazil dedicated a combined amount of over 460 million tons of maize and sugarcane respectively to biofuel production, which represents 6% of global crop production by mass [79] . By 2010, the global biofuel production represented 2.7% of the global fuel for road transportation, equating to 107 billion liters, which represents more than a 450% increase from the year 2000 [18,79] . From 2005 to 2030, the amount of world crop in million tons (and as a % of total use) used for biofuel production will increase by two- to threefold from 65 to 182 (3.2% to 6.7%) for cereal; 7–29 (4.8% to 12.6%) for vegetable oil; 28–81 (15.1% to 27.4%) for sugar (or equivalent of sugar cane), and 1–8 (0.4% to 2.3%) for fresh cassava [80] . With the global crop demand and demand for crop calories and crop protein projected to increase by up to 120% by 2050 from 2005 [81] , to meet this demand would have severe environmental impacts, characterized by greater agricultural intensification in developed nations and greater land clearing (extensification) in LMICs, leading to ∼1 billion ha of land cleared globally and ∼3 Gt y−1  of greenhouse gas emissions. The outcome of such environmental impact would be food price increases and chronic hunger, and LMICs will be the most affected. Many studies have found that an increase in the price of staple foods leads to a reduction of nearly half of the caloric intake among the poor populations [82–84] . The victims of hunger and malnutrition are mainly in resource poor regions in Central America, Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia which are net importers of food. The USA is the main exporter of maize and food aid donor with Sub Saharan Africa as its principal recipient of food aid which mainly consists of maize. If the current trend of dedicating food feedstock for biofuel continues, it is estimated that the global food aid budget would need to rise by 35% in order to maintain the 2006 level of 8 million tons of food aid [85] . While the first-generation biofuels production and its conflict with the food supply continues to dominate the literature, it is also worth noting that the social and environmental benefits of second generation biofuels continue to be a subject of contention among researchers. Some argue that cellulosic biofuel crops have some environmental advantages including improved sequestration of carbon in the soil, reduced soil erosion, and lower inputs of energy, water and agrochemicals [86,87] . It has been hypothesised that the use of agricultural residue crops to produce biofuels means that there is no requirements for additional land and almost no direct impact on food supplies and prices [87,88] . The International Energy Agency has postulated that the cultivation of second generation biofuel feedstocks creates jobs by prolonging employment past the harvest season through the production and transport of agricultural residues or waste [89] . However, the few available data on production cost suggest production of second-generation biofuel relies on most sophisticated processing production equipment and needs more investment per unit of production [62] . For example, the cost of converting cellulosic fuels has been estimated at $1.46 per 3.8 l, which compares unfavourably with that of corn-based ethanol, at $0.78 per 3.8 l [87] . Switchgrass biofuel is more than two times expensive than corn ethanol while cellulosic biofuels from corn stover and miscanthus are respectively 24% and 29% more expensive than corn ethanol [87] . These data suggest that not only will the production costs remain a big impediment to large-scale implementation of second generation biofuels, producing non-food and biofuel crops will also require access to land, hence creating a serious competition for land to produce food and fibre [17,90] . Such a competition for land remains real even if poorer quality land could possibly be utilised for the purpose of biofuel production. I is well documented that the major characteristics of degraded lands include lack of water, low soil fertility, and high temperatures, all of which combine to constrain plant growth and nutrient availability [91] . Therefore, the production of non-crop foods requires adequate access to adequate water and nutrient replenishment to maximise oil yield [17]  Water depletion and scarcity for agriculture will result in increased competition for water for both domestic or industrial uses un many countries, affecting negatively their food security. Redirecting crop residues and other biomass from livestock fodder to biofuel feedstock will reduce the quality and increase the cost of diary and meat products in LMICs. This is because crop residues and other biomass serve as livestock feed in resource poor environments. The materials also serve as primary energy source for cooking and heating as well as organic material to renew farm soils for the rural poor who can’t afford alternative energy sources and fertilisers. While the third generation biofuels production has the advantage of high yield of oil and the capture of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the technology of both the third and the fourth generation biofuel is yet to be fully harnessed and still in its infancy and has high capital costs [92] . It accounts for only 1% of global total biofuel production. At this rate, there are still technological limitations to the commercialisation of some of third and fourth generation biofuels, it is difficult to mitigate the negative effect of the first and second generation biofuels on food security.  3.2 Biofuels and foreignisation of land There are many factors driving the global land grabbing or simply the ‘foreignisation of land’ and include globalisation, trade and land market liberalisation, and global North direct investment in agriculture in global South to sustain their domestic food and energy security [93] . Zommers [93]  identified seven processes contributing to the foreignisation of lands: foreign direct investment (FDI) in food production; FDI in non-food agricultural commodities and biofuels; development of protected areas, nature reserves, ecotourism and hideaways; special economic zones, large-scale infrastructure works, urban extensions; large-scale tourist complexes; retirement and residential migration; and land purchases by migrants in their countries of origin. Nevertheless, biofuel feedstocks remain the leading driver of large-scale farmland acquisitions [94] . Some researchers have argued that land grabbing in the global South could be both beneficial and harmful with biofuel crops providing income for the rural poor while lessening domestic dependency on fossil fuel imports and increasing opportunities for export revenue [32] . However, the world's transport fuel consumption is estimated to increase by more than 60% or approximately three billion tons of oil-equivalent by 2030 [95] . Consequently, foreign based transnational corporations and/or backed by their governments and have rushed to resource poor countries mainly in South America, Sub Saharan Africa and parts of Asia to acquire cheap but rich agricultural land to meet future energy and food supplies [96] . Between 2006 and 2009, transnational corporations negotiated land acquisitions worth over 20 million hectares in low income countries [97] . Since then, the land acquisitions have exponentially grown with over 70% of the land transactions under negotiation located in Sub Saharan Africa [98] . In the DR Congo alone, over 10 million hectares were allocated to various foreign agencies/governments for biofuel and food production for exports [99] . Other countries such as the Philippines, Sierra Leone and Liberia leased out as much as 17.2%, 6.8% and 5.8% of their total land area respectively [96] . As more land, water, fertilisers and other resources are channelled away from food production to biofuel production to meet the growing energy demands and reduce the reliance on none renewable fossil fuels, food insecurity will become more prevalent especially in the most vulnerable regions. The International Energy Agency (2011) [100]  estimated that by 2050, biofuels will contribute up to 27% of the global fuel industry. Japan aims to use 20% of biofuels in its transport sector by 2030 [101]  while the EU plans to use 10% of biofuels in its transport sector by 2020 [102] . India, South Africa, Indonesia, Brazil, Australia, and Thailand have all set ambitious targets to increase their biofuels consumption [101] . Meeting the ambitious targets requires more land, water, and other farming inputs to be allocated to biofuel feedstock farming. Indeed, the land rights indicator is closely associated with four critical SDGs namely ending poverty (Goal 1), ensuring food security (Goal 2), achieving gender equality and empowering women (Goal 5), and making cities and human settlements inclusive (Goal 11).[103] . This indicator is covered under Target 1.4 of the SDGs which states: “by 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance ”[1]  How much the host governments earn from leasing their land and aligning their strategies to meet the SDGs targets remains unclear. However, Schoneveld, (2011) [94]  points out that the land acquisitions don’t cost much. For example, the land leasing price per hectare varies between USD 4.12 and 9.19 in Ethiopia (25–50 years lease with conditional on performance), USD2.50–5.00 per ha for developed land and USD 1.25 per ha for undeveloped land in Liberia (20–63 years lease with performance requirements), USD 0.60 per ha for agricultural land in Mozambique (2–5 year conditional performance-based lease, followed by then 50 year lease), USD 5–20 per ha in Sierra Leone (50 years for foreign investors and 99 years for domestic investors), USD $0.27 per ha in Tanzania (Up to 99 years and for biofuel investments up to 25 years), and USD 0.99 per ha in Zambia (first held in trust for 2–5 years to ensure performance, then 99 years) [94] . In countries like Ghana, there are no fixed rates and the price is fully negotiated with traditional authorities for a 50 year lease for foreign investors and 99 years for domestic investors, while in Mali leaseholds are free of charge if they are for commercial agriculture for a 30 year ordinary lease or 50 year long-term lease [94] . Other countries like Uganda, which are geared towards stimulating the economy, offer some land freely to foreign investors as long as the foreign recipient meets the investment criteria such as exporting 80% of the produce, employ a minimum of 30 semi-skilled workers and invest a minimum of USD one Million per hectare [104] . The emerging pattern is that of host governments leasing out land as a strategy to stimulate their underutilised agricultural industry. However, the jobs generated by the commercial farming projects and the wages offered are not always commensurate with the lost livelihoods for small holder farmers. Most of the countries involved in leasing their land especially in Sub Saharan Africa have agrarian based economies with weak legal frameworks that don’t effectively protect the citizen's land rights. Interestingly, the same countries are also net food importers and their food production is dominated by subsistence farmers who rely on rain fed agriculture and traditional farming methods [105] . In addition, the sub-Saharan African region has some smallholder farmers who are net sellers of the food, albeit the majority produce less than enough for their households [106] . In most circumstances, governments in Sub Saharan Africa lease out land without establishing the population density on the land and end depriving large numbers of households and entire communities of their livelihoods. Fischer and Shah (2010) [107]  note that on average, a hectare of rural land in countries like Uganda provides livelihoods for 4 people, thus an acquisition of 1000 ha leads to a loss of 4000 rural livelihoods.  Table 2  lists the profiles of farmland acquisitions in Africa larger than 300,000 ha and estimated loss of rural livelihoods. In 2011, 188 out of 329 projects (57%) that acquired land were for producing biofuel feedstocks [94] . These projects account for 11,220,334 ha, with 63.0% of the total area of land acquired being in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, we estimate that such land acquisitions translated into a total loss of 44,881,336 rural livelihoods, of which 28,252,242 were in sub-Saharan Africa. Small holder farmers contribute 30% of Sub Saharan Africa's gross domestic product and 40% of the region's exports [99] . Therefore, dispossessing smallholder farmers from their customary land in favour of biofuels feedstock is likely to aggravate the precarious food insecurity and negatively impact on progress to achieve the post-2105 SDGs ( Table 3 ). With the exception of Thailand, most of LMICs cultivating biofuel feedstocks suffer from hunger and are ranked highly on the global hunger index, which indicates underlying food insecurity that remains unaddressed [108] . The mass cultivation of non-food feedstock across regions will exacerbate food insecurity especially regions that predominantly rely on small holder farmers for food production. This is likely to disempower the farmers and increase their reliance on food aid, a common but inefficient strategy of addressing food deficits in resource poor countries. Sub Saharan Africa has been one of the major food aid recipients for over four decades due prolonged conflicts, bad governance and drastic weather patterns. Between 1970- 80, the region received between 2 and 4 million metric tonnes of food aid to mitigate hunger [109] . Although the number of countries experiencing conflicts and bad governance in the region reduced, unfavourable weather patterns have become more frequent increasing the region's need for food aid. Therefore further allocation of agricultural land to biofuels feedstock will exacerbate the region's food and nutrition insecurity. it is worth outlining that, ironically, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund structural adjustment programs of the '70s and '90s discouraged investment in food production in SSA in the because the US and other developed countries were producing food at a much lower cost [110] . Such policies pursued and promoted a free market agenda, the consequence of which was transforming food-producing and self-sufficient SSA countries into nations dependent on imports and food aid. Further evidence suggests that cultivating biofuels feedstock by smallholder farmers correlate with household food insecurity, deforestation and the destruction of wetlands [111] . An Action Aid (2013) study conducted in Tonkali and Bombali districts Sierra Leone found that 99% of the respondents attributed hunger affecting them to loss of their land to transnational companies. Families or individuals losing their lands did not consent to their land being leased to overseas companies; were not given sufficient information about the benefits and challenges associated with biofuel farming; the payment for their land lease was insufficient to acquire alternative land, jobs offered were too few to cover all households that lost their land, and wages from the biofuel plantation were too low to match the increasing prices of food [111,112] . Therefore, poorly executed large scale biofuel projects disadvantage small holder farmers and make them poorer by depriving them of their traditional land and constraining their ability to produce their own food. In essence, the smallholder farmers lose their food independence to become labourers on the biofuel projects. Some transnational companies have adopted policies to mitigate the negative impacts of land dispossession on the communities’ food security. Such schemes allocate plots of land to farmers to grow rice and provide inputs such as fertilisers. However, these companies control how much time the farmers spent on the plots, how much they plant and harvest. In addition, these companies do not allow the cultivation of crops on the plots other than those they have specified in line with their objectives. Farmers are required to pay for the newly allocated plots and inputs with a proportion of the harvest that these companies determine as sufficient at harvest time [113] . Whereas the support for the dispossessed communities to access land and grow food appears to be a noble cause aimed to reduce hunger and suffering, it leads to the control of and subjugation of communities ‘independence [114,115] . The transnational companies use the scheme to manipulate the availability of cheap labour by limiting personal productivity during high productivity seasons when they need more labourers and releasing the labourforce during the off peak seasons. By controlling farmers’ productivity, farmers have no say in what they produce and how much they consume and don’t accumulate much capital to enable them acquire land in another area. This eventually leaves them dependent on transnational companies.  3.3 Food wastage The abundance of food in some parts of the world has resulted in food wastage at an unacceptable level. Reports suggest that 6.7 million tonnes of food purchased in the United Kingdom (or 33% of food purchased) [116] ; 3 million tonnes of food in Australia (or 20% of food purchased) [117] , and more than 160 million tonnes of edible food available for human consumption in the United States [118]  are wasted annually. Admittedly, the most wasted foods include foods that are of primary interest to biofuel production including fresh fruit, fresh vegetables, dairy produce, meat, fish, bread, rice, and grain products. The social, economic, and environmental viability of existing food waste disposal systems as a source of biofuel have not been properly harnessed and remain underdeveloped. Needless to say, the food market in the industrialised countries is extremely competitive offering a variety of alternatives. Food wastes occur at three levels: pre-farm gate such as abattoir waste, crop waste or manure; post-farm gate to check-out (retailer's level), and check-out to post-consumer (household's level). For example, consumers have developed unique choices and preferences because of the abundance of food, perceptions of what is good food and attitude towards specific foods. The consumer perceptions and attitude have led to the creation of the perfect shape, size and/ or appearance of a product. A slight deviation from the preferred conditions drives consumers to look for alternatives which are readily available in a competitive market. The consumer's perceptions of what is perfect are constantly changing leading to modifications in food processing and packaging to meet the required specifications and create and edge as suppliers compete for the saturated market. As a result consumers in countries like the USA have over 50,000 food products that meet the same need to choose from in a typical supermarket [119] . In countries like New Zealand, apples harvested over twelve months are often thrown away when the new harvest comes in regardless of their condition [120] . Similarly, over 10% of the perishable food such as vegetables, dairy, pastry and meat products are discarded in retail stores when there sale by dates are closer to expiry [121] . The wasted food breaks down to methane emissions which is bad for the environment. In the USA, over 23% of the methane emissions are produced from decomposing food and most of the methane produced remains largely untapped [122] . Therefore, the high volumes of wasted food pollute the environment and represent the misused energy that could maximise biofuel production. For example, research suggests that food waste in the USA accounts for more than 300 million barrels of oil and that food served on the dining tables consumes as much as 10% of the USA's energy budget [123,124] . This is a significant amount of wasted energy that would erode profitability if the cost of the lost energy was not inbuilt in the pricing of the food that gets consumed. This implies, the consumers pay unnecessarily too much for food that is consumed and by eliminating waste, both food and energy prices are likely to drop. Whether the reduction of food wastage would impact the biofuel production industry remains unknown and calls for further research. Nevertheless, Modi et al. [125]  estimated that agricultural production (on farm) consumes 2–5% of commercial energy in all countries regardless of whether they are industrialised or not. Whereas this is an indicator of energy lost in producing unrequired food, it is based on the assumption that all producers have mechanised farms and doesn’t take into consideration the resilient smallholders in LMICs that have propelled ecologically friendly agriculture for generations. It is worth noting that LMICs also experience a different type of wastage mainly due to inefficiencies in production, processing and transportation. These include perishability attributed to bad weather, poor infrastructure network, poor harvesting and storage practices and limited capacity to process and transport to where it is needed. As an illustration, 40% of India's fresh fruit and vegetable are lost post-harvest annually which was estimated to equate to the food consumed in the United Kingdom annually [126] . Therefore, minimising food wastages in both developed nations LMICs would maximise feedstocks available for second generation biofuel production and reduces stress on food supplies and agricultural expansion due to increased demand for energy, a first step to achieving the post 2015 SDGs.  3.4 Poor governance and limited production capacity Viable biofuels production requires a consistent supply of feed stock. In 2007, the first and largest Sub Saharan Africa biodiesel plant worth USD 500 million was commissioned at Mount Hampden, near Harare in Zimbabwe to produce 35 million litres of biofuels annually [127] . The government vigorously mobilised many smallholder farmers to become out growers to supply the feedstock and improve farming incomes for smallholder farmers. Three years later, the plant was only operating at 10% capacity due to the lack of feedstock [128] . Smallholder farmers quickly learnt that oilseeds especially jatropha does not co-exist well with other crops as it grows too dense and kills other crops beneath it in the competition for moisture and light. The situation was compounded by the government's failure to provide extension services to farmers who had heeded the call to grow the feedstock [129] . Thomas and Kwong [130]  observed that Zimbabwe became a biofuel producer in the 1970's when it was under the economic and trade sanctions imposed by the international community on the then Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) government. Later on, the biofuel industry was significantly incapacitated by the 1990s prolonged drought. The inability of the Zimbabwean biofuel industry to withstand the various challenges is a reflection of systemic weak government capacity to create economically viable policies and environment that supports industrialisation. It is also a reflection of the inherent low agricultural capacities predominantly vested in the hands of smallholder farmers who maximise their yields and crop diversity with strategies such as intercropping. Additionally, the land is subdivided into small plots usually held under customary tenure which limits commercial productivity. The situation is aggravated by the dependence on rain for production as well as lack the capital and appropriate irrigation technologies and other inputs to scale up productivity. Weak production and industrial capacity is reflected across the region unable to marshal its vast fertile land to produce commercial quantities of feedstocks necessary to make biofuel production viable without foreign direct investment. Ghana which sought to replace 20% of gasoline and 30% of kerosene with biofuels by 2015 experienced significant feedstock limitations. Out of the 300,000 ha mobilised to cultivate palm oil to supplement the commercial farms, only 100,000 ha were cultivated [131] . Notwithstanding the inability to produce enough feedstocks, there is no clear strategy to meet the ambitious targets. Some of the countries like Ethiopia have policies that prohibit the export of feedstocks and biofuels in order to meet the domestic energy demand [132] . However, the policies can’t be enforced due to lack of refining capacity and possibly because of the poorly negotiated agreements with transnational corporations. Evidence suggests that poor blended biofuels especially ethanol cause high Reid vapour pressure, a measure of volatility that causes fuel to evaporate during refuelling and when the vehicle is not in operation [130] . Therefore, further local refinement causes the fuel to evaporate quickly which erodes the consumer's confidence [127,133] . This leaves consumers out of pocket due to the evaporation induced loss. Needless to say, the evaporation pollutes the air and on a large scale could lead to respiratory tract infections and other hazards due to smog. These factors combine to make biofuel production in the global south reliant on the efficiency, technical expertise, and effectiveness of transnational companies from the global north, which creates imbalance in trade negotiations and agreements.  3.5 Biofuel production within a weak and fragmented policy framework Globally, Sub Saharan has a huge potential for liquid biofuel production as reflected in the various projects initiated across the region. However, the region lacks a cohesive strategy on liquid biofuels it embraced. Nonetheless, some of the countries in the region have policy frameworks but these are fragmented and ineffective. Usually, Africa coordinates important regional initiatives such as security, trade and development through the African Union (AU). There is no agency mandated to lead and coordinate the biofuel industry framework at the AU level yet the industry has the potential to catalyse development in the region. An Africa wide biofuel strategy would harness the region's resources, capacity and collective bargaining power with foreign investments while protecting the rural masses from exploitation and maltreatment. Such a policy would boost investor confidence and ensure eligible countries are supported to develop a well regulated industry through the continental support systems in policy, technical and financing. For instance, the Africa Development Bank plays a key role in the financing of large energy and infrastructure projects in member states and could be used to finance the biofuels industry scale up. The absence of a collective framework has left member states to compete in attracting biofuels investments and to develop their own fragmented policies and standards. Some of the countries are unprepared and adopt standards that are developed for different contexts and environment. Antwi and colleagues (2010) [131]  noted that Ghana ventured in cultivating feedstocks before developing comprehensive standards and the regulatory framework. Later, the government adopted the International Organisation for Standardisation and American Society for Testing and Materials standards [134] . Although these standards have international recognition, they were not necessarily developed for the Ghanaian context and are likely to have some limitations because the biofuels physico-chemical properties could vary according to the nature of the soil, climatic conditions under which the feedstocks grow and the differences in feedstocks. For example, the physico-chemical properties of soybeans are different from sugarcanes or jatropha. Therefore, the adopted foreign standards could misguide the advancement of the industry. Blin et al. [167]  found that the standards adopted in Ghana did not cover the biofuels for stationary engines which play a cardinal role in economic growth through energy generation across the region. Many agribusinesses such as farms, processing industries and power generation industries in the region rely on energy from stationary engines which consume large quantities of the costly and imported fossil fuels. Biofuels present an opportunity to reduce costs of energy generation but the absence of clear standards could result in the adulteration of biofuels with impurities that will impact the performance of the generators and reduce their life span. This in turn will have a negative impact of the demand for biofuels. Sub Saharan Africa trails others regions such as Europe and Asia in regulating biofuels. Many countries in the region engaged in biofuels with ambiguous policies on the subject. Matters pertaining to the industry are fragmented in various government departments. For example, in Uganda, the National Environment Authority assesses the suitability of land for biofuel crop farming; the Investment Authority supports and coordinates foreign investments and corresponding policies while energy matters are coordinated by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. The country's oil and gas policy that seeks to use the oil and gas resources to eradicate poverty is silent on biofuels [135] . This is confusing and difficult to navigate especially for people negatively affected by the industry and for reliable information dissemination. Besides, the 2014 biofuels bill is yet to be debated in parliament [136] . Only if parliament assents the bill, then will Uganda have legal framework for the industry. Other countries rushed to formulate biofuel policies to preposition for the promising industry without extensive engagement of their people. For instance, Ribeiro et al. [168]  found that the World Bank funded Mozambican biofuels policy and strategy did not engage the civil society and was only availed to the public after completion and approval by parliament. Importantly, transnational corporations have taken over as much as one seventh of Mozambique's arable land. Existing evidence suggests that most Sub Saharan African countries don’t have comprehensive laws that explicitly articulates the biofuels environmental; social economic and legal issues. The countries involved in biofuel production offer limited support system mainly to primary activities such as land identification and allocation. Support for key activities such as research and development are almost non-existent compared to Europe, North America and Australia [137] . Similarly, most African countries don’t have strong monitoring mechanisms to protect their citizens from the unscrupulous activities of the transnational corporations who undertake unethical activities. A case in question was observed by Birega et al. [132]  in East Hererge, Ethiopia where a transnational corporation deforested a protected elephant sanctuary and planted 87% of the feedstocks until the civil society protested and brought the matter to the authorities. This case demonstrates the inability of the authorities to monitor the biofuel corporations’ unethical behaviours to minimise the ecological damage. Biofuels feedstock farms are often located in remote areas with poor road and communication infrastructures which further weaken the monitoring. Some of the feedstocks like castor beans are categorised as highly evasive weeds which compete with other crops for soil nutrients [138] . Some countries have embraced the cultivation of feedstocks without evaluating their potential risks and putting in place mitigation strategies should the plant become a nuisance. There are limited mechanisms that regulate and control the introduction of new plant species and to enforce the removal of the evasive plants and those that lose their profitability. Evasive species can have a debilitating impact on the region's weak agricultural systems [139] . In addition, there is no global forum to regulate and monitor biofuels as OPEC regulates oil (fossil fuels). Nonetheless, there are approaches that can be harnessed to promote a strong region wide frame work to monitor against risks and malpractices in the industry. The Ugandan approach of freely giving land to transnational corporations could be strengthened and adopted as a mitigation strategy against the introduction of evasive species and monitor unethical and high risk activities such as breeding and trialling of plants with unknown risks. By retaining land ownership and allowing investors to use it for the country's economic growth within specific guidelines, the transnational corporations cannot claim bona fide ownership of the land. To remain in business, the transnational corporations must comply with the government requirements knowing that the land offer can be withdrawn with minimal consequences if and the government determines that the activities on the land pose risks to the communities.  3.6 Biofuel production, land tenure, and socio-economic impacts Emerging evidence suggests that LMICs are vigorously promoting the commercialisation of agriculture to develop their rural areas. Prior to this, the international system through institutions such as the World Bank pushed for land reforms in the 1980s–90s to address land tenure in regions like Sub Saharan Africa. The predominantly traditional tenure systems were viewed as a hindrance on agricultural advancement because it did not guarantee the tenure security to make long term agricultural based investments [140] . The land reforms seem to have contributed to the catalysation of the commodification of land which is slowly edging out traditional tenures while accelerating the growth of the real estate in the region. Furthermore, through the land reforms which included titling of the land, Africa's was recorded to hold more than half of the global arable land most of which was listed as underutilised [141] . The seemingly abundant land coupled with the indispensability of agriculture on humanity makes the acquisition Africa's vast fertile land paramount. Large numbers of people are being dispossessed of their traditional land, creating a pool of the landless class that will have to sell their labour to the commercial farms and their commensurate industries. In a way, this is similar to the early 18th century scramble and partition of Africa when Europe subdued and divided the African landmass among the different imperial powers. This gave the imperial powers the access to the vast and resources on the continent to feed their growing industries in Europe. Land was appropriated and the traditional owners were forced to work on large plantations such as Sisal, cotton and rubber for export [142] . To date, the transnational corporations have gone back to Africa with similar objectives as their colonialist predecessors. The transnational corporations have the host government's consent and contribute to local taxation although some of them avoid paying their due taxes [143] . Host governments have weak capacity to negotiate for commensurate tax thresholds and monitor the complex transnational corporations. Besides, the host governments are more interested in attracting foreign direct investments for economic growth; they provide investors with incentives such as long tax breaks and subsidies. Many countries such as Ethiopia, Sudan, Mali and Uganda offer agricultural investors a variety of concessions including tax on profit [144] . Nonetheless, some of the biofuels investors still find means of tax avoidance to maximise their returns to capital. Eluding taxation chokes the growth of the host economies and does not give them the accruing benefits. The presence of the biofuel farms and industry attracts infrastructure developments which are often integrated in government's development objectives but are usually unfulfilled due to lack of capital. For example, in Southern Mali, Mali-Folke Centre encouraged farmers to become Jatropha out growers to supply the feedstock. In return, the farmers were paid for the feedstock and those living within 20 km radius of the biofuel project centre were connected to the biofuels generated electricity grid.[145]  The availability of electricity to rural households may not address all their social economic challenges but it generates multiple benefits including small scale industries and good health outcomes as people use clean energy for lighting and cooking instead of biomas that produce hazardous smoke while burning to generate energy. Household pollution caused by burning of solid biomass for energy cause over 600,000 premature deaths across Africa [146] . Therefore scaling up of rural electrification initiatives such as the Mali example will improve more people's wellbeing and reduce pollution-related mortality. Forty two of the 52 countries in Africa countries are net oil importers and remain vulnerable to the raising global oil prices [147] . Most of these countries have not harnessed their energy sources such as hydro, geothermal and solar energy to meet the growing demand. In Sub Saharan, Africa, the International Energy Agency [146]  estimated that only one out of every three people has access to electricity which accounts for less than 2% of the global energy usage. Energy access is a key driver for development and biofuels can provide a leeway for the region to become energy sufficient. This will save on the much needed foreign exchange used to procure and import fossil fuels. For example, the biodiesel plant commissioned in 2007 in Zimbabwe was estimated to save the Zimbabwean government over USD 80 million annually from the importation of diesel [147] . Therefore biofuels if well harnessed and regulated could offer energy security to the world's poorest regions. Regardless of the accruing benefits, Timilsina et al. [148]  observed that the burgeoning growth of biofuels will lead to the reduction of the global GDP as the biofuels volumes increase. This is likely to cause the economies that depend on fossil fuels exports to contract especially those that don’t diversify their exports. When major economies GDPs contract, other countries will be affected. The authors used the example of India with ambitious blending (fossil and biofuels) target of 20% by 2020 to estimate the potential GDP contraction. For India to meet its target, it will need to increase its commodity imports by 3.9–4.6% while reducing the exports by 1.7–6%. Thus the marginal income from exports will be outstripped by the larger imports bill resulting in a 0.13–0.23% reduction of the GDP. However, for poor countries that have traditionally had limited increased biofuels and feedstock exports are likely to stimulate their GDP growth. How the GDP growth will reverse the food insecurity and lost livelihoods of small holder farmers who were dispossessed of their lands needs further investigation.  3.7 Biofuel production and conflicts While large commercial farms of biofuel feedstock are promoted as a solution to Africa's low agricultural productivity, failed commercial farms can set the government against its constituencies. For example, in Madagascar the government was overthrown for leasing 1,300,000 ha of land to Daewoo of Korea [149] . A new government cancelled the lease and the project did not take off. Alinova et al. [150]  linked the Sudanese civil war to the early 1970s establishment of commercial farms that displaced large populations who had cultivated and grazed on the land around the Nuba Mountains for many generations. The Sudanese government earmarked over 5.5 million hectares of land to transform the country's agricultural productivity [151,152] . The dispossession resulted in a localised conflict that pitted the communities against their government. This later metamorphosed into a large conflict and created conducive conditions for protracted civil war in the 1980s. Zoomers [93]  reported that the spike in land conflicts in West Kilimantan, Indonesia corresponded with the increase in land cultivated with palm oil crop for biofuels from 500,000 ha in the 1990s to over 3.2 million hectares. In Cambodia, media reports suggest that over 500,000 people are disputing the land concessions to transnational corporations [153] . Furthermore, global conflicts could increase with super power militaries such as the United States military harnessing cheap renewable fuels which could sustain their military operations. The USA Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency has led the way to develop renewable biofuels [154] . This will enhance the military capabilities enabling them to travel and remain in action for sustained periods. Biofuels could significantly reduce the cost of military operations which could in itself increase conflicts within and between countries. Shachtman [155]  reported that the US Army will embark on developing biofuel-based aircraft carriers and support ships in 2016. The transformation from nuclear energy to renewable biofuels will increase the demand for the biofuels feedstock and food prices are likely to further increase, leading to food insecurity. Recent studies have reported that increasing food prices and food insecurity are closely related to the likelihood of urban unrest, social unrest, rebellion and armed conflicts [156–159] . For example, food insecurity increases the likelihood of both civil conflicts (i.e. armed conflicts between the state and an opposition group) and communal conflicts (conflicts between two or more discrete communities that neither target nor directly involve the state) [156] . The process by which increased food prices and food insecurity increases the likelihood of civil conflicts is multifaceted but increasing social grievances, providing a motive for engaging in rebellion and armed civil conflicts, and the lure of food, shelter, and protection as material incentives for joining rebel armies [156–159] . Responses to food insecurity and hunger caused by increased food prices include food aid, with the USA as the largest food donor. Emerging evidence suggests that a 1% increase in per capita food aid from the USA increases the incidence of any conflict by 1.65–1.72 percentage-points. However, a 1% increase in per capita food aid from the USA increases the incidence of internal conflict by 6.6 percentage-points in countries that have never had a civilian government and only 1.2% in countries that have always had a civilian government [159] .  3.8 Biofuel production and deforestation While quantifying the impact of biofuel production on deforestation is confronted with methodological challenges, the relationship between biofuel development and tropical deforestation is real and complex [160] . The opening up of vast land for biofuel farms leads to the loss of bio diversity. For example, in South East Asia, over 13 million hectares rich biodiversity were cleared and replaced with the palm oil crop to feed the biofuel industry [161] . Sulle highlighted that Tanzania allocated 34,000 ha of rich natural forests in Kilwa, south of Tanzania that were cleared leaving irreversible damage to the ecosystem in favour of jatropha cultivation [162] . Importantly, forests act as watersheds, carbon stores and are habitats for flora and fauna [163,164] . Forests are a source of livelihoods for many communities around them. There loss has a negative impact on our well-being especially as the increase of biofuels feedstock farming will lead to an average deforestation of up to 1 million hectares annually [95] . The loss of this magnitude is likely to result in extreme consequences such as the drying up of waterways, soil erosion and long droughts which will impact negatively the environment and food security. Some studies have estimated that the degradation of forests for biofuel feedstock releases up to 420 times more greenhouse gasses than the savings made by the reduced fossil fuels utilisation [165] . The continued degradation of forestland will change the land usage, increase greenhouse gas emissions and destroy the biodiversity, all of which will impact negatively the food supply system.   4 Conclusion With a total of 17 goals and 169 targets, low and middle income countries will be overwhelmed with the task of implementing and monitoring progress by trying to expend too much effort for too little returns. Our findings suggest that biofuel production strategies and policies need to be aligned with the SDGs targets through a process of prioritisation to identify targets that are amenable to intervention in the short and long term. However, there are factors that might impact the implementation, monitoring and prioritisation processes. These include: data scarcity and inconsistent data across countries, lack of capacity and poor leadership (e.g. reliance on the private sector through foreign investments in most feedstock producing countries and the private sector's reluctance to disclose all their operations due to tax implications), weak legal and policy frameworks (e.g. incoherent biofuel policies and standards to govern production, processing and marketing) and land rights and ownership issues (e.g. affected land ownership in most low income countries is customary land and affected rural population is difficult to estimate in the absence of appropriate statistics). Notwithstanding these challenges, increasing use of food crops to produce biofuels in the United States, European Union, Japan and Brazil has been one important element in explaining the steady rise in staple food prices since 2000. While this is a potential threat to food and nutrition security in low and middle-income countries, biofuel production also offers significant opportunities, for example, in Sub-Saharan Africa. The evidence on current practices in biofuels feedstock farming in Sub Saharan Africa suggests that the social and economic benefits of biofuels initiatives heralded by foreign entities do not always accrue to local communities. Nonetheless, if well harnessed, biofuels represent the opportunity for the transformation of Sub Saharan Africa economies from low to middle income countries. The challenge is to meaningfully address the trade-offs in order to make biofuels beneficial to all especially the rural poor farming households without distorting food and eco systems. This calls for strong and streamlined policies on feedstock farming, processing and trading. Such policies must address the rhetoric of stakeholder participation in land use management for the post 2015 sustainable development agenda. In addition, while goal 7 of the SDGs addressed the issue of ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, there is an urgent need to have specific economic, environmental, health, social, institutional, and technological targets for biofuels development as part of the United Nations’ goals.
