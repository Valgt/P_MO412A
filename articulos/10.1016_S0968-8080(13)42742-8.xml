                  Since the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo placed reproductive health and rights firmly on the international agenda, civil society and other advocates have worked ceaselessly to ensure that they remain central to women’s empowerment and have taken all opportunities to expand the framework to include sexual health and rights. When the development process changed with the introduction of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2000, sexual and reproductive health and rights were excluded, and only in 2007 was universal access to reproductive health added back in. In 2014 and 2015, the future of ICPD Beyond 2014, the MDGs and the post-2015 development framework will be decided, following consultations and meetings across the globe. This paper takes stock of the key influences on efforts to achieve the ICPD agenda and summarises the past, current and planned future events, reports and processes between 1994 and 2014, leading up to the determination of the post-2015 development framework and sustainable development goals. It concludes that the one thing we cannot afford to allow is what happened with the MDGs in 2000. We must not leave the room empty-handed, but must instead ensure the inclusion of sexual and reproductive health and rights as a priority under a new health goal.

                  <ce:simple-para id="sp0005" view="all">Since the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo placed reproductive health and rights firmly on the international agenda, civil society and other advocates have worked ceaselessly to ensure that they remain central to women’s empowerment and have taken all opportunities to expand the framework to include sexual health and rights. When the development process changed with the introduction of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2000, sexual and reproductive health and rights were excluded, and only in 2007 was universal access to reproductive health added back in. In 2014 and 2015, the future of ICPD Beyond 2014, the MDGs and the post-2015 development framework will be decided, following consultations and meetings across the globe. This paper takes stock of the key influences on efforts to achieve the ICPD agenda and summarises the past, current and planned future events, reports and processes between 1994 and 2014, leading up to the determination of the post-2015 development framework and sustainable development goals. It concludes that the one thing we cannot afford to allow is what happened with the MDGs in 2000. We must not leave the room empty-handed, but must instead ensure the inclusion of sexual and reproductive health and rights as a priority under a new health goal.</ce:simple-para>

                  <ce:simple-para id="sp0010" view="all">Depuis que la Conférence internationale sur la population et le développement (CIPD), organisée en 1994 au Caire, a fermement placé la santé et les droits génésiques à l’ordre du jour international, la société civile et d’autres activistes ont travaillé sans relâche pour qu’ils demeurent au centre de l’autonomisation des femmes et ils ont saisi toutes les occasions d’élargir le cadre de travail pour y inclure la santé et les droits sexuels. Quand, en 2000, le processus de développement a changé avec l’introduction des objectifs du Millénaire pour le développement (OMD), la santé et les droits sexuels et génésiques ont été exclus, et ce n’est qu’en 2007 que l’accès universel à la santé génésique a de nouveau été inclus. L’avenir de la CIPD au-delà de 2014, des OMD et du programme de développement de l’après-2015 sera décidé en 2014 et 2015, après des consultations et des réunions autour du globe. Cet article fait le point des influences majeures sur les activités pour réaliser l’ordre du jour de la CIPD et résume les événements passés, présents et futurs prévus, les rapports et processus entre 1994 et 2014, qui aboutiront à la définition du programme de développement de l’après-2015 et d’objectifs du développement durable. Il conclut que nous ne pouvons absolument pas nous permettre de reproduire ce qui s’est passé avec les OMD en 2000. Nous ne devons pas repartir les mains vides ; au contraire, il faut que nous garantissions l’inclusion de la santé et des droits sexuels et génésiques comme priorité au titre d’un nouvel objectif relatif à la santé.</ce:simple-para>

                  <ce:simple-para id="sp0015" view="all">Desde que la Conferencia Internacional sobre la Población y el Desarrollo (CIPD) celebrada en 1994 en El Cairo puso la salud y los derechos reproductivos en la agenda internacional, la sociedad civil y otros promotores han trabado sin cesar para asegurar que continúen siendo fundamentales para el empoderamiento de las mujeres y han aprovechado todas las oportunidades para ampliar el marco a fin de incluir la salud y los derechos sexuales. Cuando el proceso de desarrollo cambió con la introducción de los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio (ODM) en el año 2000, se excluyeron la salud y los derechos sexuales y reproductivos; fue solo en 2007 que se volvio a incluir el acceso universal a servicios de salud reproductiva. En 2014 y 2015, se decidirá el futuro de la CIPD más allá de 2014, los ODM y el marco de desarrollo post-2015, tras consultas y reuniones mundiales. En este artículo se evalúan las influencias clave en los esfuerzos por lograr la agenda de la CIPD y se resumen eventos, informes y procesos anteriores, actuales y futuros planificados entre 1994 y 2014, que conducen a la determinación del marco de desarrollo post-2015 y los objetivos de desarrollo sostenible. Se concluye que lo único que no podemos permitir es lo que sucedió con los ODM en 2000. No debemos salir con las manos vacías, sino garantizar la inclusión de la salud y los derechos sexuales y reproductivos como una prioridad bajo un nuevo objetivo en salud.</ce:simple-para>

               <ce:para id="p0010" view="all">Since the adoption of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) Programme of Action in Cairo in 1994, sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights have been recognized as integral to successful sustainable development, as well as fundamental human rights.<ce:cross-ref refid="bb0005" id="cf0005">

The Programme of Action presented a new vision of the relationship between population, development and well-being, placing human rights at the centre of these policies and addressing a comprehensive range of related issues. Reproductive health and rights, including family planning and sexual health, were placed firmly on the international agenda.<ce:cross-ref refid="bb0005" id="cf0010">

                     <ce:para id="p0035" view="all">Consensus was not possible, however, on the inclusion of sexual rights, for which no shared definition exists to this day, and sexual health was (illogically) subsumed under reproductive health. Nor were enough Governments able to agree on full access to safe abortion, let alone based on a woman’s right to choose. Adolescent access to sexual and reproductive health education, information and services also aroused controversy, which was settled by using earlier language from the Convention on the Rights of the Child that recognized the importance of parental guidance at the same time as the evolving capacity of the adolescent. This was further defined, giving priority to the welfare of the child up to the age of 18 years, in the Platform for Action at the 4th World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995.<ce:cross-ref refid="bb0010" id="cf0015">

It can be considered a “high-water mark” in promoting the ICPD agenda insofar as the outcome document, <ce:italic>Key actions for the further implementation of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development</ce:italic> (Key Actions), moved the agenda forward in some areas. These included that access to safe abortion where permitted by law (the ICPD formulation) should include the training of health care providers to ensure that such abortion should be safe and accessible.<ce:cross-ref refid="bb0015" id="cf0025">

This has frustrated sexual and reproductive health and rights proponents who, although they saw ICPD as the best available language in 1994, considered it still far from satisfactory.</ce:para>

                     <ce:para id="p0050" view="all">Progress after 1999 might be described as “spasmodic” at best. Each year since 1994, the UN Commission on Population and Development has considered different aspects of the ICPD agenda. But as priorities have evolved and changed, it has become increasingly difficult for progressive language to be introduced in the resolutions that have been adopted, e.g. promoting access to comprehensive sexuality education, or the rights of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community. This is because of increasing, stronger and more obtrusive opposition.</ce:para>
                     <ce:para id="p0055" view="all">Anti-abortion organizations were present in Cairo and the Holy See was working with the countries that ultimately entered reservations on the Programme of Action, particularly text on abortion, regulation of fertility and reproductive rights. One statement that was brokered early on and has remained a stumbling block for proponents is the inclusion (in the chapeau to the Principles in Chapter II of the Programme of Action) of explicit recognition of the sovereignty of each country in decisions about implementation. By the time of ICPD+5 and subsequently, opposition organizations have regularly targeted sessions of the Commission on Population and Development, and the political arena has, in general, also become more conservative. Nowadays proponents of the ICPD agenda have to be ready to counteract opposition to a broad spectrum of sexual and reproductive health and rights issues, including access to emergency contraception, comprehensive sexuality education and, of course, abortion. But they also have to counteract challenges on more mainstream issues such as “gender equality” and “access to services”. Procedurally, opponents have taken to organizing lobbying meetings with representatives of national delegations from countries supporting their views in advance of sessions of the Commissions on Population and Development and the Status of Women, in order to solidify their positions.</ce:para>
                     <ce:para id="p0060" view="all">Nevertheless, a number of progressive resolutions have been adopted by the Commission on Population and Development, for example its 2012 resolution on adolescents and youth.<ce:cross-ref refid="bb0020" id="cf0030">

                        </ce:cross-ref> When there has been a stalemate in negotiations, the deadlock has sometimes been broken by the introduction of a Chair’s text. However, opponents are increasingly dismissing such texts as not being “negotiated” or “agreed language”. While the ICPD Programme of Action continues to provide a firm basis for negotiations, agreed language from other fora is also introduced. This includes not only language in documents such as the Beijing Platform for Action, but also, for example, Human Rights Council resolutions. In this regard, individuals such as both the Special Rapporteurs on the Right to Health have been particularly helpful in introducing language that might be considered controversial. Nonetheless, at present, it appears that the practice of using earlier consensus language is being eroded, with the concept of sexual and reproductive health and rights still being treated as highly contentious.</ce:para>

Civil society has also taken on the battle against conservative forces, with the sexual and reproductive health and rights community becoming increasingly more effective. They have reached out to other organizations for support, including those working on human rights, such as Amnesty International, and on migration. They have also worked with more mainstream women’s organizations, which promote women’s empowerment through economic rather than social initiatives, who however may consider that sexual and reproductive health and rights get in the way of their own agendas. Violence against women and early and forced marriage, on the other hand, present areas of common ground on which they can come together. In addition, youth groups and coalitions have increasingly gained recognition and demanded the right to be heard, so much so that at the recent Economic Commission for Europe Conference, they worked together and were called on regularly by the Chair as the “youth delegation” to contribute to the discussions.</ce:para>

Its Target 5A also includes sexual and reproductive health care and family planning in its call to “Ensure universal access to primary health care”. However, it is not difficult to see why so many civil society organizations were hostile when the report was released insofar as it only refers to sexual and reproductive rights in the context of reduction of high fertility rates (both in the targets and in the text itself), without recognition of the full range of sexual and reproductive health rights.<ce:cross-ref refid="bb0115" id="cf0170">

Two co-chairs were appointed, namely the UN Ambassadors of Hungary and Kenya, and so far it has met four times. A further four meetings are scheduled between November 2013 and mid-February 2014.

Given the problems that are surfacing in getting sexual rights included at the international level, wording that was introduced into paragraph 145 of <ce:italic>The World We Want</ce:italic>, when it was clear that there was no agreement even on reproductive rights, used the following language: “…[advancing] the commitments leading to sexual and reproductive health and the promotion and protection of all human rights in this context”.

This is a very different process from that used at the Commissions on Population and Development and the Status of Women, which is based on UN Economic and Social Council consultative status with NGOs. The Major Groups are organized around constituencies, rather than substantive topics. Thus, there can be no Major Group on health or sexual and reproductive health and rights. Instead, there are Groups, for example, for Women; Children and Youth; Farmers, Workers and Trade Unions; Local Authorities; and Non-Governmental Organizations. Although “other stakeholders” are meant to be involved in “Thematic Clusters and Steering Committees”, these processes are far less well defined and should be further developed in the future.</ce:para>

They include the High-Level Task Force for ICPD, which has a number of high profile members, including its co-chairs (former Presidents Tarja Halonen of Finland and Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique) and strong civil society advocates for sexual and reproductive health and rights.<ce:cross-ref refid="bb0150" id="cf0230">

                        </ce:cross-ref> There are also other ongoing UN activities, such as the Commission on the Status of Women, for which the main theme of the 58th Session in 2014 is “Challenges and achievements in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals for women and girls”, from which the emerging issues will be on the post-2015 development agenda. As maternal health has been a priority focus in the MDG process and for the UN Secretary-General, his initiative <ce:italic>Every Woman, Every Child</ce:italic> has strongly promoted maternal health, with US $20 billion being committed by more than 250 partners and the very successful Women Deliver Conference in 2013.</ce:para>
                     <ce:para id="p0360" view="all">In reality, however, much of the work of the UN System will be focused on the post-2015 development agenda as the guiding force from 2015 to 2030.</ce:para>

                  <ce:para id="p0370" view="all">A Road Map for negotiations on the post-2015 outcome document was agreed at the General Assembly Special Event on 25 September 2013.<ce:cross-ref refid="bb0155" id="cf0235">

                     </ce:cross-ref> The outcome document sets out the process for moving forward to the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda, for which inter-governmental negotiations will start at the 69th UN General Assembly Session beginning 16 September 2014 and continue for most of the following year. Meanwhile, the Open Working Group and the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing will continue up to that date, when negotiations will begin.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0375" view="all">The President of the UN General Assembly has also announced that he will convene General Assembly events under the theme “The Post-2015 Development Agenda – Setting the Stage”. All stakeholders including “civil society, scientific and knowledge institutions, parliaments, local authorities, and the private sector” will be invited to be involved. The Secretary-General will synthesize the full range of inputs then available and present a synthesis report before the end of 2014. Finally, a Summit at Heads of State and Government level will be convened in September 2015 to adopt the post-2015 development agenda, in preparation for which the President of the UN General Assembly should convene inter-governmental consultations on “organizational modalities” for this Summit.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0380" view="all">It should also be noted that in the 25 September 2013 Special Event outcome document, Heads of State and Government reaffirm that they will target the most off-track MDGs and those where progress has stalled, such as “universal access to reproductive health, including maternal health”. This is a different language formulation from that which is usually used, in that it places greater emphasis on reproductive health than maternal health, but it is still far too limited. On the other hand, it does demonstrate that Governments can actually move beyond agreed language when negotiating in certain fora.<ce:cross-ref refid="bb0155" id="cf0240">

                     </ce:cross-ref> The “resolute promotion of gender equality”, and “the elimination of the range of barriers to women’s and girls’ empowerment” are also recognized in the document as underpinning and advancing progress across all the goals. Finally, national ownership is stressed, while emphasizing that international support is necessary if the MDGs are to be achieved by 2015.</ce:para>

                  <ce:para id="p0405" view="all">Given the history of the process of implementation of the ICPD Programme of Action and the growth of opposition to it, no one can pretend that getting comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights into the post-2015 development agenda will be easy. At this point, it is also still difficult to see how the ICPD Beyond 2014 outcomes will be fed into the process, other than as one part of the Secretary-General’s synthesis report at the end of 2014 as the two processes continue to run on two parallel tracks. But the outcome of the General Assembly Special Event shows that in the lead-up to 2015, they can converge.</ce:para>

In this connection, when negotiations in Rio became difficult, issues related to the environmental and sustainable development agendas took precedence over social development, governance concerns, sexual and reproductive health and rights issues, and accountability modalities. A further caveat that tempers the optimism engendered by the new UNFPA framework is the “cautious” approach to language on sexual and reproductive health and rights in the UN Secretary-General’s interim report and the reports of the Open Working Group’s co-chairs, which do <ce:italic>not</ce:italic> move beyond the language of ICPD. Thus, the stage is set for future negotiations.</ce:para>
