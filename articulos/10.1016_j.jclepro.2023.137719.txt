                  The assessment and monitoring of society's progress towards sustainability requires a multidisciplinary approach in which tools, indicators and data are integrated across existing frameworks. In this sense, the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) framework introduced by UNEP/SETAC Life Cycle Initiative are two of the most important references used by practitioners to assess sustainability at territorial level, in the first case, and at process, product, or organizational level, in the second case.
                  However, due to the different scopes of SDGs and LCSA, the integration between the two tools has been limited so far and the synergies mostly remained untapped. Building on LCSA literature, and with the aid of text-mining analysis, this manuscript analyzes how linkages between product LCSA and SDGs have been and could be addressed, also highlighting key challenges and needs for connecting LCSA with SDGs in a coherent and operational way.
                  The paper highlights that, although SDGs and LCSA are complementary and could inform and feed each other, as of today there is no harmonized way to set up and analyze the connections between the two and progress still seems far from reaching general consensus. Further research is needed to consistently link LCSA metrics to SDGs goals and thus ensure that improved products sustainability effectively contributes to progress towards more sustainable territories.

Handling Editor: Zhifu Mi The assessment and monitoring of society's progress towards sustainability requires a multidisciplinary approach in which tools, indicators and data are integrated across existing frameworks. In this sense, the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) framework introduced by UNEP/SETAC Life Cycle Initiative are two of the most important references used by practitioners to assess sustainability at territorial level, in the first case, and at process, product, or organizational level, in the second case. However, due to the different scopes of SDGs and LCSA, the integration between the two tools has been limited so far and the synergies mostly remained untapped. Building on LCSA literature, and with the aid of text-mining analysis, this manuscript analyzes how linkages between product LCSA and SDGs have been and could be addressed, also highlighting key challenges and needs for connecting LCSA with SDGs in a coherent and operational way. The paper highlights that, although SDGs and LCSA are complementary and could inform and feed each other, as of today there is no harmonized way to set up and analyze the connections between the two and progress still seems far from reaching general consensus. Further research is needed to consistently link LCSA metrics to SDGs goals and thus ensure that improved products sustainability effectively contributes to progress towards more sustainable territories.

Addressing such challenges requires global guidance and cooperation to implement transformations and actions on the ground, as well as relevant frameworks of tools, indicators and data to monitor the progress towards sustainability (Sachs et al., 2019 ). Although it can be generally agreed that sustainability refer to "meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" (United Nations Brundtland Commission, 1987 ), the interpretation of what should be sustained and to which extent is not univocal (Patterson et al., 2017 ). A mainstream concept to guide and monitor the transition towards sustainability is that of Triple Bottom Line (TBL), which targets 3 dimensions: environmental protection, economic growth and social equity. Other relevant concepts address for example the accounting and safeguard of capitals generating total wealth (e.g., natural and socio-human capitals) (Capitals Coalition, 2021 ; Science for Environment Policy, 2017 ), or the respect of planetary boundaries (PB) and achievement of minimum standards necessary to live in an environmentally-safe and socially-just space (Raworth, 2012 ). Building upon the TBL, the United Nations (UN)'s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) indicate a pathway to follow in order to shape a sustainable future for the world (United Nations, 2015 ,2020 ). The need to act is so urgent that sustainability considerations linked to SDGs are progressively considered in major policy initiatives such as the European Green Deal (European Commission, 2019 ) and the post-Covid recovery plan of the EU (Borchardt et al., 2020 ). As illustrated in Table 1   (and further detailed in Tables SI–1 ), the SDGs introduce a framework of 17 objectives, 169 targets and 247 indicators addressing the "five Ps" (i.e., people, planet, profit, peace and partnership) to guide territories (e.g., countries, regions) towards sustainability (Brown and Rasmussen, 2019 ). Rather than acting as an independent entity, SDGs are interlinked and mutually influencing each other (European Environmental Agency, 2019b ; Sachs et al., 2019 ). The TBL is the reference also for the life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) framework presented by the UNEP/SETAC Life Cycle Initiative (2011) , the discussion towards which started in the 2000s (e.g., see Klöpfer, 2003 , 2008 ). The framework consists of methods and indicators to quantify and assess the sustainability of products (goods and services), as well as organizations, across their value chain (Gloria et al., 2017 ; Guinee et al., 2011 ). LCSA integrates three approaches: environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Life Cycle Costing (LCC) and Social LCA (SLCA). While the term "LCSA" covers LCA, LCC and SLCA, the term "LC(S)A" is used in this paper to generically refer to a life cycle approach used for sustainability assessment (e.g., either referring to LCA, LCC, SLCA or LCSA). With a focus on products, LCSA has been object of an increasing number of applications and developments in the last decade (Visentin et al., 2020 ), broadly addressing different economic sectors (e.g., Gava et al. (2019)  and Mahbubi and Uchiyama (2020)  for food systems; Kouloumpis and Yan (2021)  for renewable energy systems; Wulf et al. (2017)  for critical raw materials), also because of a growing interest in SDG12 – sustainable consumption and production (Sala and Castellani, 2019 ). Visentin et al. (2020)  indicate that most applications refer to the energy sector, followed by transportation, industry, construction, and waste management sector. Other sectors seem to make less than 10% of total LCSA studies. LCSA allows understanding interlinkages and trade-offs between different sustainability aspects of products and organizations (Kua, 2017 ; Laurent et al., 2019 ; Sachs et al., 2019 ). LCSA can also be scaled-up to the level of sectors, territories and economies (Gloria et al., 2017 ; Guinee et al., 2011 ) and used to analyze how results contribute to the achievement of SDGs (Laurent et al., 2019 ). Understanding the interlinkages between LCSA and SDGs can enhance the assessment, interpretation, reporting and communication of information about the sustainability of products. Some studies in the realm of sustainability assessment have linked LCA with SDGs and/or the concept of PB (e.g., Sala, 2019 ; Sala et al., 2020 ; Sanyé-Mengual and Sala, 2022 ), or employed SDGs for classifying social indicators according to the severity of social issues addressed (Ekener et al., 2018 ). Other studies adopted a broader scope by assessing interlinkages between LCSA and SDGs and/or developing SDG-based LCSA methods (e.g., Wang et al., 2018 ; Weidema et al., 2020 ; Wulf et al., 2018 ). However, as concluded in Wulf et al. (2019) , based on the analysis of 258 publications from 1997 to 2018, "the connection between the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), indicator selection and LCSA is still under discussion". This is confirmed in a more recent review by Alejandrino et al. (2021) , which points out a low frequency of LCSA studies systemically addressing SDGs (3 out of a sample of 100), while it is easier to find general references to key SDGs (e.g., Gava et al., 2019 ; Kouloumpis and Yan, 2021 ) or overarching policy goals (e.g., Mahbubi and Uchiyama, 2020 ). All in all, the literature appears to indicate that further research effort is needed to connect the different perspective of SDGs and LCSA (Wulf et al., 2018 ), and understand how LCSA indicators can best address SDGs. Building upon existing LCSA literature, this work aimed at further clarifying the relationship between LCSA and SDGs, by:• Analyzing works explicitly addressing the linkages between LC(S)A studies and SDGs. Relevant studies are analyzed with respect to key characteristics relating to goal and scope (e.g., type of the analysis), impact framework, integration and interpretation of results (Section 2 ).  • Investigating, with the aid of text mining analysis, associations existing between product LCSA and SDGs, areas of SDGs covered by LCSA, complementarities, interdependencies, and weak points (Section 3 ).  • Discussing key challenges and needs relating to the connection of LCSA with SDGs (Section 4 ).     2 Analysis of LCSA studies explicitly addressing SDGs 2.1 Approach description The first phase of the work was to search for and analyze relevant LCSA studies explicitly addressing SDGs, based on the following steps:1. LCSA studies addressing SDGs were first searched in Scopus on 5 July 2021 using the following combination of key words ("SDG*" OR "sustainable development goal*") AND ("LCSA" OR "life cycle sustainab*"). This resulted in 13 documents published from 2015 onwards (reflecting when SDGs were agreed and published).1  1 The core work of this paper was carried out in 2021, with the paper being submitted in March 2022 and revised in March 2023. For transparency, the authors acknowledge that other researchers may have been working in this field of research. New relevant contributions have been included in the final discussion section, although it was not possible to cover new publications in the research approach of Section 2 .    2. Extracted documents were screened to check their relevance for the study, i.e. how explicitly they were addressing the linkage between LCSA and SDG. This resulted in 6 documents (see Tables SI–2  in the Supplementary Information).  3. To broaden the scope of the analysis, other relevant documents were included based on knowledge gained in the ORIENTING (Alvarenga et al., 2021 ; Pihkola et al., 2022 ). This resulted in a total of 13 documents retained for analysis, which are listed in Table 2  .    The following characteristics were analyzed:• Goal and scope of the study- Type of approach followed to analyze LCSA and SDGs (see below).  - Theoretical approach vs. application of approaches to case studies.  - Life cycle stages and stakeholders addressed.  - Data sources.     • LCSA-SDG impact framework.  • Integration and interpretation issues (e.g., Areas of Protection (AoP) and impact pathways considered, aggregation techniques, handling with double counting and trade-offs, interpretation and communication of results).    In particular, the following classification was defined to distinguish between different types of approaches that link LCSA and SDGs:• Type-I: "LCSA-to-SDG", where the main focus is to analyze the SDGs addressed by impact categories used in LC(S)A;  • Type-II: "SDG-based LCSA", where SDGs are used to inform LC(S)A;  • Type-III: "SDG-LCSA mapping", where the main focus is to map SDG and LC(S)A along cause-effect chains;  • Type-IV: "SDG-embedded LCSA", where SDGs is fully integrated in LCSA and its impact pathways.     2.2 Results 2.2.1 Goal and scope 2.2.1.1 Type of approach Most of the analyzed documents (8) address Type-II approaches. In most of these cases, SDGs are used to complement LCA in the definition of impact categories and indicators for SLCA and LCC (Henzler et al., 2020 ; Kühnen et al., 2019 ; Maier et al., 2016 ; Wang et al., 2018 ; Wulf et al., 2018 ; ZNU, 2020 ). Differently, Ekener et al. (2018)  use SDGs for classifying, in qualitative and semi-quantitative terms, the severity of social issues in the social domain of the LCSA, while Schaubroeck and Rugani (2017)  define areas of protection for LCSA and their interconnectedness with SDGs. Three documents report Type-I approaches, where the focus is on LCSA and the analysis of its contributions to SDGs (Laurent et al., 2019 ; Visentin et al., 2020 ; Weidema et al., 2020 ). Two documents are instead classified as Type-III approaches since providing a detailed mapping of SDGs and LCA across the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework (Chandrakumar and McLaren, 2018 ; Dong and Hauschild, 2017 ). Interestingly, only Weidema et al. (2020)  introduced a quantitative LCSA impact pathway framework based on SDG indicators (Type-IV); next to a method to qualitatively analyze how indicators used in LCA and SLCA interlink with and contribute to SDGs (Type-I).  2.2.1.2 Theory vs. practice A theoretical approach is often described in the analyzed documents. Laurent et al. (2019)  presents a conceptual paper describing how sustainable life cycle engineering of products can contribute to meeting the SDGs. Chandrakumar and McLaren (2018)  and Dong and Hauschild (2017)  show how LCA, PB and SDGs can be integrated into the DPSIR framework. Schaubroeck and Rugani (2017)  analyze primary and indirect AoPs, and interlinkages among AoPs and SDGs, whilst Visentin et al. (2020)  map the main topics covered in LCSA, and how they relate to SDGs. A LCSA framework partly or fully based on SDGs is then described by Ekener et al. (2018) , Henzler et al. (2020) , Kühnen et al. (2019) , Maier et al. (2016) , Wang et al. (2018) , Weidema et al. (2020) ; Wulf et al. (2018) , and ZNU (2020) . Some of the documents propose and test – through case studies – new methods (e.g., biomass- and fossil-based fuels (Ekener et al., 2018 ), urban surfaces (Henzler et al., 2020 ), computer mouse (Kühnen et al., 2019 ), cooperation projects for built innovations (Maier et al., 2016 ), municipal solid waste systems (Wang et al., 2018 ), or electrolytic hydrogen production (Wulf et al., 2018 ). Furthermore, the method developed by Weidema et al. (2020)  will be tested in practice with case study companies.  2.2.1.3 Life cycle stages and stakeholders addressed In general, all documents address, or make reference to, the whole life cycle of products. Differently from LCA, a stakeholder perspective is relevant in LCSA for the selection of indicators (Visentin et al., 2020 ). While Maier et al. (2016)  and Schaubroeck and Rugani (2017)  address society as a whole, some authors explicitly indicated the need to specifically address stakeholders such as producers, consumers and academia (Laurent et al., 2019 ; Wulf et al., 2018 ), as well as persons living in poverty (Wang et al., 2018 ). This can also serve as motivation for moving towards sustainability. With a specific focus on SLCA, workers, local communities, value chain actors, consumers, society and children should be considered for inclusion in LCSA studies (UNEP, 2020 ). The Handbook for Product Social Impact Assessment used in the Type-I approach of Weidema et al. (2020)  also includes small-scale entrepreneurs as separate category of stakeholders. Furthermore, different evaluation perspectives can be considered in LCSA (Ekener et al., 2018 ).  2.2.1.4 Data sources Indications on data sources are usually provided in documents referring to practical applications. A number of data sources are needed for addressing LCSA and SDG analysis. Data requirements for LCSA are far more complex and time consuming than for LCA studies. LCA is conducted using primary data that is complemented by LCA databases and software tools (e.g., as referred to in ZNU (2020)  and Henzler et al. (2020) ). A major difficulty in LCSA is the lack of data (Kühnen et al., 2019 ). SLCA can be carried out by using generic data (e.g., from the Social Hotspot Database (SHDB), as indicated by Ekener et al. (2018) ), although this must be complemented with literature review, online websites, statistical databases and interviews (Maier et al., 2016 ; Wang et al., 2018 ). This might be sufficient for testing the concept of a methodology, but the representativeness of generic data for a specific case is often limited.   2.2.2 LCSA-SDG impact framework Impact categories covered with methods and indicators used in LCA can be broad and various (e.g., Hauschild et al., 2013 ; Huijbregts et al., 2016 ; Zampori and Pant, 2019 ), as observable from the analyzed literature (Chandrakumar and McLaren, 2018 ; Dong and Hauschild, 2017 ; Weidema et al., 2020 ). Such variety is still more evident in SLCA, where many social topics are relevant for different stakeholder groups, many of them linking with one or more SDGs. Social topics can be assessed both in a qualitative and quantitative way (UNEP, 2020 ; Goedkoop et al., 2020 ). Visentin et al. (2020)  identified the main environmental, social and economic impact categories/indicators used in 105 LCSA studies, as shown in Table 3  . While indicators used in LCA consider complex environmental mechanisms, indicators used in SLCA and LCC are in many cases directly addressing social issues or economic aspects (Wang et al., 2018 ). Visentin et al. (2020)  highlight there are interlinkages between production and consumption systems, indicators used for LC(S)A and SDGs. The analysis of interlinkages between LCSA and SDGs can be performed either at SDG, SDG target, or SDG indicator level (See Table 1 ). For example, Weidema et al. (2020)  thoroughly analyze interlinkages between LCA, SLCA and SDGs 12 (sustainable consumption and production), 14 (marine resources), 15 (terrestrial ecosystems) and 17 (global partnership for sustainable development), with other SDGs on the way. Laurent et al. (2019)  report the life cycle approaches can allow targeting 33 targets belonging to 12 SDGs. As emerges from the examples provided in Table 3 , the analysis is strongly influenced by the impact categories and indicators considered in LCSA, as well as by the tier of analysis (i.e., at SDG, SDG target, or SDG indicators level). By analyzing Tables 3  and it also appears that LCSA studies for products in general fail to address SDG-related issues in a comprehensive way. According to Weidema et al. (2020)  a linkage between LCSA and SDGs is not always possible. For example, LCSA adopts a product life cycle perspective and a focus on specific topics (e.g., work-related issues in SLCA) that may not be able to capture all SDGs (thus, neither SDG targets nor indicators) or satisfactorily reflect their macro-scale implications (e.g., with LCC). The analyzed documents also present different approaches to integrate SDGs in LCSA. Henzler et al. (2020)  provide a framework of 43 indicators, clustered in 27 LCSA impact categories (16 of quantitative and 11 of semi-quantitative nature) and 11 SDG impact category groups. The framework is able to qualitatively address the three pillars of the TBL, all SDGs, and many SDG targets. This is a further refinement of the methodology described in Maier et al. (2016)  and Wang et al. (2018) . Wulf et al. (2018) , qualitatively assigned 51 LCSA indicators (i.e., 32 social indicators, 14 environmental indicators and 5 economic indicators) to 14 out of 17 SDGs (SDG 2, 11 and 17 not covered). The selection of LCA indicators was based on the ILCD recommendations of EU-JRC (2011)  and guidance from the UNEP/SETAC on a midpoint level (UNEP SETAC, 2017 ). Land use and energy demand were not assigned to any SDG, at the goal level. LCC indicators (e.g., levelized cost of energy, net present value of the investment, operation and deconstruction phases, profitability index of an investment, marginal cost of energy supply, internal rate of return, payback time, dynamic payback time) referred to European Investment Bank and literature on energy technologies. SLCA indicators were selected based on the PSILCA database 1.0 (Ciroth and Eisfeldt, 2016 ). 32 out of 54 indicators were found to address SDGs. In a second tier of analysis, Wulf et al. (2018)  used 38 LCSA indicators to (partially) cover indicators for 12 out of 17 SDGs (note: SDGs 5, 9, 13, 15 and 17 were not covered). 22 social indicators and 16 LCA indicators were linked with SDG indicators. Interestingly, land use and energy demand indicators, which found no place at the SDG level, were assigned to SDG indicators 11.3.1 and 7.3.1, respectively. However, it is worthy observing that SDG 13 (climate change) was not covered since the respective SDG indicators are targeted towards climate change adaptation (and not mitigation, which is the conventional focus in LCA). Interestingly, LCC indicators, although linked to SDG 7, 8 and 9, often do not fit as SDG indicators. In fact, while SDG indicators address macro-economic systems, LCC indicators are process or company specific. Kühnen et al., 2019  defined qualitative and semi-quantitative indicators for the assessment of (i) social, (ii) environmental, and (iii) economic, governance and institutional aspects of companies and products, using LCA and SDGs as reference systems. Not all SDGs are covered, but only those targets to which a company can have a positive contribution:• SDG targets 1.1, 1.3, 3.9, 4.7, 8.5, 8.7, 8.8, 12.4, 13.3 for social aspects.  • SDG targets 2.4, 2.5, 6.3, 6.4, 6.6, 12.4, 12.5, 13, 14.1, 14.3, 14.4, 14.5, 15.1, 15.3, 15.4, 15.5 for environmental aspects – based on LCA.  • SDG targets 9.5, 12.2, 12.6, 12.8, 16.3, 16.6, 17.3, 17.6, 17.7, 17.16 for economic, governance, and institutional aspects.    Ekener et al. (2018)  developed a methodology for LCSA where the SDG framework is used for classifying, in qualitative and semi-quantitative terms, the severity of social issues in the social domain of LCSA (an important share of SDGs addresses social issues). All SDGs are considered (goal and target levels) and the SHDB (Norris et al., 2011 ) used. ZNU (2020)  defined 21 core indicators and 24 supplementary indicators for measuring the sustainability of products, with which it is possible to cover 59 out of 169 SDG targets (i.e., those directly related to products). 25 indicators refer to products, and 20 to companies involved along the life cycle. Core (mandatory) indicators were selected based on the PB (Steffen et al., 2015 ) for the environmental domain, and the Declaration of Universal Human Rights of the United Nations (United Nations, 1949 ) for the socio-economic domain. Supplementary indicators were selected from broadly accepted frameworks (UN's SDGs (United Nations, 2015 ), Environmental Footprint (European Commission, 2013 ), Global Reporting Initiative (2016) ). However, a full SDG-based LCSA is only presented in Weidema et al. (2020) . A new LCSA method is introduced that places the SDG indicators in a quantified impact pathway framework allowing the assessment of: (i) inventory indicators; (ii) midpoint impacts on each of the 17 SDGs, and/or targets and indicators; (iii) overall impact on sustainable wellbeing. SDG indicators can appear in different interdependent impact pathways (not necessarily related to the original conceptual topic), and monetization is used to calculate the single endpoint measure of sustainable wellbeing.  2.2.3 Integration and other operational issues As apparent from the previous sections, LCSA and SDGs framework can result in a broad set of indicators. An important operational issue for LCSA is the integration and interpretation of results within and across sustainability domains. This is also inherently connected to the definition of AoPs, and the handling of possible double counting and trade-offs. 2.2.3.1 Areas of protection and aggregation of LCSA results With a specific LCA focus, Dong and Hauschild (2017)  and Chandrakumar and McLaren (2018)  analyzed interlinkages between LCA, PB and SDG indicators, how they are positioned in the cause-effect chain, described according to the DPSIR model, and which impact categories and AoPs they address among “human health”, “ecosystem quality”, “environmental risks to agriculture and fisheries”, “resource availability” and “man-made environment”. While LCA indicators can refer to pressures, state and impacts, thus having both a societal and environmental dimension, SDGs tend to address drivers and responses at a more societal level (Dong and Hauschild, 2017 ). When it comes to economic and social analyses, these still lack a set of commonly accepted indicators (Visentin et al., 2020 ). However, as described in UNEP (2020 , 2021) , most SDGs are qualitatively linked to social topics and stakeholder groups. Therefore, SDGs could offer a framework aiding the selection and integration of LCSA indicators (Visentin et al., 2020 ). Different integration approaches are described in the analyzed documents. A simple but effective integration through visualization techniques is adopted by Maier et al. (2016) , Wang et al. (2018)  and Henzler et al. (2020) . Ekener et al. 2020 apply an aggregation based on multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). Different perspectives for prioritization and weighting are considered for the social topics (based on SDGs or SHDB). Aggregation at the SDG level is proposed by ZNU (2020) . Individual indicator results are equally weighted based on working hours and aggregated either with respect to the three dimensions of sustainability (ecology, economy, society), or the extended "five Ps": People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace and Partnership. In their quantitative approach, Weidema et al. (2020)  suggest using "sustainable wellbeing" as the endpoint of the quantified SDG-based impact pathway framework. However, they acknowledge that the division between inventory and midpoint impact indicators may not be easy. Monetization is used to calculate the single endpoint measure of sustainable wellbeing. In their qualitative approach, both aggregation at SDG target level and SDG level is possible through an equal weighting approach. Some targets may overlap, causing double counting and results depend on reference scale and benchmark products. Schaubroeck and Rugani (2017)  distinguish between primary and indirect AoP in LCSA. While the former one addresses "human well-being" (subdivided in "human health" and "happiness"), the latter one refers to "man-made environment", "natural ecosystems", "natural resources", and "prosperity". Indirect AoPs (AoIPs) must be protected to sustain the primary AoP (AoPP), i.e., "human well-being". Human well-being is proposed as primary AoP based on the human-centric nature of the original concept of sustainable development, according to which fulfilling human needs is the ultimate goal for sustainability (Schauebroeck and Rugani, 2017 ). According to Schaubroeck and Rugani (2017) , one third of the SDGs address "human well-being" as AoP (e.g., SDGs "good health and wellbeing", "quality education", "reduced inequalities"). Another third of SDGs overlap with "human well-being" and at least another AoP). This shows, once more, the strong focus of SDGs on human well-being, as an area of primary protection, and the importance of human needs in the context of sustainable development. The SDG framework could be used to define an impact pathway for midpoint indicators contributing to human well-being. Schaubroeck and Rugani (2017)  propose that an aggregation method for coming up with a single-score indicator describing the "well-being" AoP should be developed, in order to support decision-making. They propose "well-being adjusted life years" (WELBY) as the most promising, holistic, single-score indicator for sustainability assessment, while acknowledging that some further adjustments to the concept are still needed (Schaubroek and Rugani, 2017 ).  2.2.3.2 Trade-offs and interpretation of results The selection of LCSA indicators can be carried-out to cover SDGs and underlying indicators, while avoiding double-counting. However, the SDG framework does not address aggregation of impacts, nor always defines sustainability thresholds and clear boundaries among SDGs. On the one hand, SDGs provide long-term objectives. On the other hand, the high number of targets and their diversity hamper the identification of single solutions or the consideration of trade-offs at different scales (Schaubroeck and Rugani, 2017 ). Furthermore, while SDGs focus on changing conditions on a country-level, LCSA focus on processes or technologies. This brings uncertainty in the evaluation of how a process can contribute to achieve SDGs (Wulf et al., 2018 ), and calls for the development of SDG-based key performance indicators (KPIs) for companies and products (Laurent et al., 2019 ). Laurent et al. (2019)  highlighted the need of (i) internalizing environmental impacts in product/production costs; and (ii) addressing trade-offs between SDGs through priority or weighting approaches. Different perspectives for prioritization and weighting are for example presented by Ekener et al. (2018)  based on the explicit reference (higher severity and weighting factor), or not, of SDGs and related targets to social topics. Additionally, MCDA is applied for integrating the results of the LCA, LCC and SLCA taking into consideration three different theoretical stakeholder profiles: individualist (prioritizes economic dimension first, and social dimension last), egalitarian (prioritizes social dimension first, and environmental dimension second), hierarchist (prioritizes environmental dimension first, and economic dimension second). Interpretation of LCSA results can be possible also through the separate analysis of results (Henzler et al., 2020 ; Kühnen et al., 2019 ), also resorting to appropriate visualization techniques highlighting positive and negative impacts and the occurrence of trade-offs between domains and life cycle stages (Maier et al., 2016 ; Wang et al., 2018 ; Ekener et al., 2018 ; ZNU, 2020 ).     3 Text-mining analysis of LCSA-SDG linkages The screening described in Section 2  highlighted that interlinkages between LC(S)A and SDGs are usually analyzed on a qualitative level (Alejandrino et al., 2021 ; Bojarska et al., 2021 ; Visentin et al., 2020 ; Wang et al., 2018 ; Wulf et al., 2019 ). Text-mining (also called text analytics) (Hearst, 1999 , 2003 ) can be used as complementary tool to quantitatively investigate structures within a defined sample of texts. Text mining can unlock quantitative linkages (correlations) between parts of text relating to LC(S)A and SDGs. Here it is used to reflect the findings from Section 2  by analyzing structures in current scientific literature, and identifying how SDGs areas are covered in literature on LC(S)A. This section shows the application of text-mining to a broad sample of LC(S)A documents. When a document text addresses pre-defined LC(S)A- and SDGs-related terms, the document is flagged as addressing LC(S)A-SDGs interlinkages. The coexisting terms are extracted and treated as data. In this way, LC(S)A-SDG interlinkages can be analyzed in semi-quantitative terms and visualized. 3.1 Approach description The following steps were applied for the application of text mining:1. Searching for potentially relevant documents.  2. Dictionary construction: definition of key terms relating to (i) impact categories and indicators of LCSA topics (LCA, SLCA, LCC, circular economy), and (ii) SDGs and their targets.  3. Text mining pre-processing: cleaning and tokenization.  4. Text mining on a dictionary-based content: collecting the individual case of the LC(S)A terms and counting the mentioning of SDGs terms within a document, and vice versa.  5. Mapping of interrelation between LC(S)A and SDGs.    3.1.1 Searching for potentially relevant documents To achieve a robust sample size, LCSA studies addressing SDGs were first searched in Scopus on 3 September 2021 using the following combination of key words TITLE-ABS-KEY ("SDG*" OR "sustainable development goal*") AND ALL ("LCSA" OR "life cycle sustainab*"). This search resulted in 133 documents (published after the agreement on SDGs in 2015). If not already included in these search results, also documents screened in Section 2  and listed in Table SI-2  were considered for the text-mining analysis.  3.1.2 Dictionary construction Key terms (and synonyms) are defined to create logical verbal connections with (i) impact categories and indicators of LC(S)A topics (LCA, SLCA, LCC, circular economy), and (ii) SDGs and their targets. The full list of key terms used in this paper is presented in tables SI-3 and SI-4 . The definition terms were based on the knowledge developed in the ORIENTING project (Alvarenga et al., 2021 ; Pihkola et al., 2022 ). Terms represent either words or phrases referring to:• LCA impact categories and indicators, for the environmental domain.  • SLCA topics, for the social domain.  • LCC cost items and indicators, for the economic domain.  • Circularity and criticality aspects (including design/business strategies), material/waste flows and their management, for the circular economy domain.  • Methods (e.g., approaches, applied frameworks, databases and software tools) and indicators used in each of the above topic.  • SDGs and the related targets that include the goals related terms plus explicitly mentioning SDGs directly (e.g., SDG plus numbers).    It should be noted that as machines recognize numbers and not the language itself, some words are possibly double counted, even though the key terms are carefully set, mainly due to (i) the combination with multiple words (e.g., plastic vs. marine plastic) (ii) words based on the same root.  3.1.3 Text mining pre-processing To detect key terms in collected documents more effectively, text cleaning and tokenization were executed through the Quanteda R package developed with the support of the European Research Council (Benoit et al., 2018 ). The list of references, URLs, symbols, punctuation marks, stop words (i.e., the most common words in a language like articles, prepositions, pronouns, conjunctions, etc.) were removed since they are not relevant for further investigations. Unlike the conventional process of text cleaning (Borchardt et al., 2020 ), numbers were kept because of the nature of SDGs. Tokenization split sentences through an entire document into smaller units like individual words that starts with stemming. Stemming words recalls lemmatization. For example, "govern", "governing", "governance", "government", or "governments" indicate similar meanings although their form is different due to grammatical reasons. The reason for both stemming and lemmatization is that different forms of words would be each counted separately without stemming, even though these words are from the same root and carry similar meaning. Therefore, it is preferable to unify these words. All text is changed to lowercase, but acronyms with all-uppercase characters are kept.  3.1.4 Text mining on a dictionary-based content In the text mining step, three sub-tasks are included that relates to (i) frequency of the words, (ii) co-occurrence of the words, (iii) counting the key-terms based on LC(S)A-SDGs dictionary. Tasks are executed using the Quanteda R package (Benoit et al., 2018 ). Word frequency count is one of the most widely applied text mining techniques (Duriau et al., 2007 ; Short et al., 2010 ). The starting point is to recognize and provide an overview of words that occur more frequently. It is assumed that there is a strong correlation between the words most frequently mentioned and the intention of the text. Co-occurrence of words is identified when two words are within a five-words distance, and an occurrence matrix is built (Jurafsky and Martin, 2018 ). Based on the co-occurrence matrix, a co-occurrence map is created. For dictionary-based content analysis, the defined key terms in the previous step are used as a dictionary. The terms are re-bound to key terms in case they are multiple words. Key terms in the documents are counted based on the LC(S)A-SDGs dictionary as shown in Table SI-3  and Table SI-4 . The screening process records the count as many times as the key terms are found in a document by each dictionary of the categories that contain key terms. The screening has been done respectively, on LC(S)A and SDGs sides independently. Once the screening of the key terms in a document is completed, matched key terms are summed per each LC(S)A category and SDG level (see Fig. 1 ).  3.1.5 Mapping of interrelation between LC(S)A and SDGs Links between LC(S)A and SDGs were mapped by focusing on key terms simultaneously occurring in the same document. For example, key terms could co-occur in a single document and refer to "water use", "land use" and "cost-benefit analysis" on the LC(S)A-side, and to SDG 1, SDG 2 and SDG 17 on the SDG side. It is thus interesting to draw links between LC(S)A topics and SDGs. Fig. 2    shows the concept of the linkage between LC(S)A and SDGs in a single document. Equal priority was assigned for the importance of each word. The screening record tables from text mining were also reshaped and aggregated for the creation of a Sankey diagram. Four sub-steps have been implemented to reorganize the data and adapt it to the Sankey structure:i. Merge LC(S)A and SDGs screening result tables by document to set a co-occurrence data point per document.  ii. Omit data points with a zero of key term count on either the LCSA or SDG.  iii. Calculate relation intensity index values of LC(S)A to SDGs and SDGs to LC(S)A.  iv. Reaggregate each category under the LCA, LCC, SLCA, Criticality, and Circularity to link them to each SDGs.    Zero counts are excluded as they are not covered in the document when the key terms are not mentioned. For the ratios of the linkage between LC(S)A and SDGs, these are divided by each other. The proportional index is taken due to the imbalanced hierarchy, and as a result, the difference in total number of terms that counted in both systems. The visualization of the Sankey diagram is done by networkD3 (Gandrud et al., 2017 ) in R version 4.1.1 (R Core Team, 2021 ).   3.2 Results Based on the counting of keywords, it was possible to observe how frequently LC(S)A and SDGs topics populate the analyzed documents, as well as to investigate their interrelations. 3.2.1 Frequency and co-occurrence of main terms Concerning the frequency of appearance of terms, a word cloud was generated (Fig. 2 a) where the most frequently used words are represented with greater text size. In addition, the co-occurrence of words was detected and visualized in Fig. 2 b. The word cloud (Fig. 2 a) offers an overall picture of the analyzed documents, which are clearly about sustainable development and sustainability assessment, looking at different aspects of sustainability with different methods, approaches and levels of investigation. When adding an element of connection as in the co-occurrence map, it is apparent that most correlations address LCA of products. This also reflects the state of development from methodological side and findings from Section 2 . The keywords of highest term frequency also populate the co-occurrence map, but with less connections than the overall framework related terms.  3.2.2 Occurrence of SDG terms Fig. 3   shows the total frequency of SDG-relating terms as well as the explicit mentioning of SDGs (e.g., "SDG 12". For the explicit mentioning of SDGs (see blue bars, scale on the right side in Fig. 3 ), the following observations are made:- Affordable and clean energy (SDG7) returned being the most frequently referred SDG, followed by responsible consumption and production (SDG12), climate action (SDG13), and sustainable cities and communities (SDG11). Together they make 38.8% of SDG word counts. Besides SDG13, which is of utmost political interest and relevance, these SDGs have a direct link with the sustainability of product and technology systems.  - The following group consist of zero hunger (SDG2), clean water and sanitation (SDG6), decent work and economic growth (SDG8), no poverty (SDG1), and good health and well-being (SDG3) makes another 33.3%. These are less product-oriented and more focused on socio-economic issues and cooperation to increase equality at territorial and global level. Industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG9) also ranks in this range, with a share of 5.7%.  - Quality education (SDG4), gender equality (SDG5) and reduced inequalities (SDG10), which have similar orientation of the previous group, are mentioned less frequently (10% in total). This is also the case for life on land (SDG15) and life below water (SDG14) (8.4%), which address biodiversity conservation, as well as for peace, justice and strong institutions (SDG16) and the partnerships for the goals (SDG17) (6.7%).    Furthermore, it is worth pointing out that sector specific SDGs (i.e., SDG7, SDG11) originate from fewer publications with a focus on the topic and thus a relatively high count per relevant publication. At the same time, no SDG is mentioned by more than 35 publications, while over 50% of the investigated publications do not explicitly mention any of the goals. This may indicate that the current LCSA literature is analyzing SDGs with a narrow focus on SDGs. When the analysis is performed considering SDG-related keywords (see orange bars, scale on the left side in Fig. 3 ), the word count increases significantly by a factor of around 30, and the main tendencies in frequency between the SDGs remain. Again, it is confirmed that SDG7 and SDG12 are frequently addressed topics. However, some variations are detected: relatively lower frequency for SDG1, SDG2, SDG9 and SDG11, and relatively higher frequency for SDG17. This can mainly be retraced to the choice of keywords and their frequency outside the direct SDG meaning, indicating the relevance of the SDG topic beyond direct SDG context.  3.2.3 Occurrence of LCSA terms Fig. 4   provides an overview of the LSCA-related keywords mentioned in the sample of documents analyzed. For all dimensions, the results are further differentiated between methods (e.g., approaches, applied frameworks, databases and software tools) and indicators. Overall, the distribution among the originating samples is broader with more documents of significant counts, and overall frequencies are significantly frequent than for SDGs (especially for environmental and social indicators). Environmental and social sustainability indicators are more frequently mentioned than other categories, including methods for the respective domains. In the case of economic sustainability and circularity, keywords mainly refer to methods, while indicators are underrepresented. For environmental and social sustainability, indicator systems are relatively broad and advanced (even though not always reaching a broad consensus/level of development, as the case for social sustainability). Indicators for assessing economic sustainability and circularity, are significantly less frequent, which somehow reflects a narrower scope or a less mature development compared to environmental and social issues. With a narrower focus on criticality, only few counts could be identified, pointing out a significant gap in the sample of documents investigated, also highlighting research needs at broader level, as well as missing link to existing LCSA frameworks. A further detail of specific keywords referring to LCA and SLCA is shown in Fig. 5  . Within the environmental dimension, the significance of the different indicators varies strongly. The indicator of highest occurrence is depletion of fossil resources, followed by climate change, biodiversity and eutrophication, all reaching counts beyond 500. Together they make above 60% of total word counts. The occurrence of the first two topics confirm the attention over energy and climate aspects found in the analysis of SDGs (see Fig. 5 ), which are topics traditionally covered in LCA (Vanham et al., 2019 ). Surprisingly, biodiversity occupies the third place, although this is not often analyzed in detail in the current LCA practice (Vanham et al., 2019 ). Land use (312), human toxicity (226) and water (190) are of medium occurrence, which also is the case for single points (aggregated scores) and comprehensive LCIA frameworks. Together, they make another 30% of total word counts. Finally, many traditionally used impact categories (acidification, photochemical ozone creation, ozone depletion, energy resources (beyond fossil fuels), ecotoxicity, ozone depletion, ionising radiations) are less frequently mentioned. For SLCA, the main indicators addressed are supplier relationships, end of life responsibility, health and safety, all with around 1000 counts, followed by smallholders (including farmers). SLCA frameworks are also identified to be among the most frequently mentioned terms. Furthermore, several indicators appear with a lower frequency of 100–200 appearances, including fair salary, equal opportunities, education, ethical animal treatment, economic development contribution, social responsibility as well as working hours. In this range also the SLCA databases are positioned. For the other indicators, few or no count is identified. The indicators with no or low counts include most indicators with indirect product relation (such as community engagement, respect of indigenous rights or safe and healthy living conditions), but also key indicators such as child labor, freedom of association and collective bargaining, privacy or transparency.  3.2.4 Interrelation of LC(S)A and SDGs terms A Sankey diagram using the text mining results for LC(S)A and SDGs was developed based on an abstracted relation intensity index (see Fig. 6  ). The Sankey diagram based on the co-occurrence gives a broader overview of how each LC(S)A domain is mentioned together with SDGs in the documents. This diagram, which is not publication-specific since is a collection of texts that show how researchers used key terms in their literature, can be interpreted in two directions: (i) LC(S)A mentioned toward SDGs (Fig. 6 a), (ii) SDGs mentioned to LC(S)A (Fig. 6 b). The normalized co-occurrences depicted in the Sankey diagrams generally support the abovementioned findings, but additionally offer a more distinct view on the relations from the dimensions of LC(S)A to the SDGs and vice versa. The overall share of word counts discussed above is similar to the left-hand side each, reflecting the term frequency of LCSA dimensions for a) and among SDGs in b). For LC(S)A-to-SDGs, the co-occurrence to the different SDGs of all dimensions appears to be homogeneous, resulting in a relatively evenly distributed share among the SDGs. The highest intensity for the circularity dimension is on SDG15 followed by SDG10, for social on SDG16 and for environmental on SDG1 followed by SDG10. In the SDGs-to-LC(S)A analysis, the heterogeneous count of the SDGs results in a differentiated distribution among the LC(S)A dimensions, with a higher share in criticality (with a still absolutely low number), SLCA and LCA. While on LCC the numbers do not change significantly, the circularity index decreases by over 43%. SDG7 is the most mentioned, followed by SDG12 and SDG17, following SDG7. In contrast, SDG5, SDG9, SDG16, SDG15 were poorly interrelated to LC(S)A. Although a number of considerations should be handled (e.g., a bias of users to build on the dictionary, weighting or clustering of domains equally), this analysis can provide a holistic view of the interrelations.    4 Discussion and conclusions This paper analyzed how linkages between LC(S)A studies and SDGs can be addressed, also highlighting key characteristics, challenges and needs for connecting LCSA with SDGs in a coherent way. To this end, a two-pronged analysis was conducted, i.e., combining, on the one hand, an in-depth qualitative analysis of selected key literature and, on the other hand, a systematic analysis of a wider body of knowledge on LCSA and SDGs through text mining. Synergies certainly exist between LCSA and SDGs, although one of the biggest challenges is to clearly define how the two frameworks can be integrated with each other. This goes beyond the different scales of application for which they were designed, i.e., product/organization for LCSA and territories for the SDGs, and also concerns the scope of SDGs and LCSA metrics. This brings uncertainty in the evaluation of how a process can contribute to achieve SDGs (Wulf et al., 2018 ). Nonetheless, a better understanding of interlinkages between LCSA and SDGs can enhance the assessment, interpretation, reporting and communication of information about the sustainability of products (measured through LCSA), and contribute to the sustainable development of territories (addressed by SDGs). Most scholars focused on a more qualitative definition of the type of relationship between the SDGs and LCSA metrics, i.e., how far SDGs can be addressed through LCSA indicators. To the knowledge of the authors, only Weidema et al. (2020) , Sanyé-Mengual and Sala (2022)  have been working on quantifying this relationship in a comprehensive way. However, no harmonized way exists to set and analyze connections between LCSA with SDGs, and progress seems still a long way from reaching consensus. This is partly due to the nature of the SDGs structure itself. In fact, SDGs are relatively manageable at the level of objectives (17) but their targets (169) and indicators (247) add technical and operational complexities. This may be a reason why the analysis of interlinkages between LCSA and SDGs was found to be more often at SDG or target level. Another complexity is the different level of maturity of LC(S)A underlying assessments. Thanks to a higher methodological maturity level, LCA seems to pave the way to SLCA and LCC. In fact, while the main challenge of LCA remains to connect and model established LCA impact categories to the SDGs, a clear set of indicators and underlying methodology still need to be agreed for the social and economic dimension. In particular, effort is ongoing to harmonize the SLCA practice and scale-up analytical capacities (Alvarenga et al., 2021 ; Pihkola et al., 2022 ; Weidema et al., 2020 ). Indicators addressing environmental and socio-economic issues are used both in SDGs and LCSA. SDGs tend to address drivers and responses at societal level, while LCSA has more a focus on environmental pressures and impacts, for which more complex cause-effect mechanisms are traditionally considered. Some environmental issues receive more attention than others (e.g. climate change mitigation) both in terms of scope of the analysis and referencing in documents. Interestingly, although the level of maturity of indicators can affect their frequency of use, recent sociopolitical discussions appear to strongly influence the intensity with which a certain environmental issue is handled. For example, acidification is an impact category that is typically assessed in LCA but that has less coverage than biodiversity. With respect to socio-economic issues, since many SDGs are linked to social topics and stakeholder groups (UNEP, 2020 , 2021 ; Weidema et al., 2020 ), they can help identify indicators to use in LCSA. As a result, most studies rely on "hybrid" approaches to define LCSA indicators. However, even if the use of complementary metrics might sometimes ease the connection of LCSA with SDGs (e.g., the use of employment data or GDP), they are often based on different types of data referring to different scales. Furthermore, links between LCSA metrics and SDGs are fuzzy and not always univocal, depending on LCSA impact categories, SDG's tier of analysis (i.e., at goal, target, or indicator level), and the perspective embraced in the analysis. In particular, this is true for LCC metrics: by adopting a business perspective in most cases, LCC metrics do not clarify whether they are actually supporting a sustainable society or, instead, a trade-off exists between company and society stakes. Integrating and making sense of information referring to different sustainability aspects is a critical challenge. The SDG framework does not address aggregation of impacts, nor always defines sustainability thresholds and clear boundaries among SDGs. Weighting methods are often applied in LCSA, influencing the conclusions of an assessment (Wulf et al., 2022 ). Methods to integrate LCSA results, amongst which methods based on the SDGs framework, are being tested in the ORIENTING project (https://orienting.eu/ ). The SDG framework can offer a guide to identify and complement LCSA indicators, especially for what concerns the social dimension of sustainability, while PB could be taken as normalization reference for promoting a shift from relative to absolute environmental sustainability (Bjørn et al., 2020 ). However, the high number of targets and their diversity hamper the identification of single solutions or the consideration of trade-offs at different scales (Schaubroeck and Rugani, 2017 ). A possible way to streamline the SDG framework could be to improve its structure by clustering its elements according to the sustainability pillars (or AoPs) that are primarily addressed, as well as highlighting inherent interconnections and overlaps among different sustainability aspects, e.g., through better visualizations. Another operational aspect to consider is the availability of data and software tools, which can help reduce the gap between comprehensiveness of sustainability assessment vs. its practical applicability, as well as the necessity of harmonized nomenclature. For example, there are cases in which impact categories (e.g., climate change) and indicators (e.g., global warming potential) are treated in an interchangeable way. New research in the field may have been produced since the literature search was undertaken and the paper published. Some recent advancements in literature have been identified, e.g., a call for papers on "Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment for Sustainable Development Goals" has been launched by the Journal of Industrial Ecology. However, it is apparent that further research is needed to ensure that improved sustainability of products (measured through LCSA) can contribute to progressing towards more sustainable territories (addressed by SDGs). Advancements in this field, which can be oriented by the results of this work, will allow professionals involved in sustainability assessment and management to better understand and operationalize the interlinkages between LCSA and SDGs for the benefit of society.
