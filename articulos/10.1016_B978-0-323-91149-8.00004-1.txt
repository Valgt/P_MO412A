               In recent years, scientists have found that the consequences of human-induced climate change can endanger the whole planet and cause destruction of many ecosystems. One of the primary and comprehensive global actions to prevent destruction and preserve healthy ecosystems was the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that were adopted by all United Nations members in 2015. Humans need to change their behavior, and industries must move toward SDGs if we are looking ahead to a brighter future. The building construction industry uses huge quantities of raw materials and is involved in high energy consumption. This industry has been known as one of the most polluting sectors that have caused enormous adverse environmental impacts. Immediate action is necessary to reduce these negative impacts. Building materials are mainly responsible for most environmental impacts, and finding eco-friendly alternatives is crucial. Bio-based materials have shown great potential to be used in buildings. Different types of bio-based materials have been tested in buildings, and the results were promising. These materials improve both the environmental and economic aspects of building construction. In this chapter, most common bio-based building materials are introduced, and their contribution to SDGs is indicated.

One of the primary and comprehensive global actions to prevent destruction and preserve healthy ecosystems was the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that were adopted by all United Nations members in 2015. Humans need to change their behavior, and industries must move toward SDGs if we are looking ahead to a brighter future. The building construction industry uses huge quantities of raw materials and is involved in high energy consumption. This industry has been known as one of the most polluting sectors that have caused enormous adverse environmental impacts. Immediate action is necessary to reduce these negative impacts. Building materials are mainly responsible for most environmental impacts, and finding eco-friendly alternatives is crucial. Bio-based materials have shown great potential to be used in buildings. Different types of bio-based materials have been tested in buildings, and the results were promising. These materials improve both the environmental and economic aspects of building construction. In this chapter, most common bio-based building materials are introduced, and their contribution to SDGs is indicated.   Keywords Bio-based materials  Bio-economy  Climate change  Green buildings  Sustainable development goals   1 Introduction The consequences of human-induced global warming are irreversible and catastrophic. In the past decades, scientists from various disciplines put all their efforts to find the best solutions to combat global warming. They have called for concerted and rigorous actions from people and legislators to adopt a healthier and low-carbon lifestyle to fight climate change. The world population is estimated to exceed 9.5 billion in 2050 (Tripathi et al., 2019 ). As a result, more food is needed, and additional resources are required to satisfy the increasing demands of the future population. Consequently, increasing pressure on the planetary boundaries is expected. By now, four of nine planetary boundaries have been passed due to destructive human activities: climate change, biosphere integrity, land-system change, and biogeochemical cycles (water, carbon, sulfur, phosphorus, and nitrogen) (Mohajan, 2015 ). The other five boundaries are expected to be crossed if immediate actions are not taken. Moreover, overexploitation of natural resources and increasing the use of fossil-based materials are the consequences of increasing urbanization, that are leading to significant adverse environmental impacts. Moving toward a green future requires essential changes in each industry. Finding green and eco-friendly materials as an alternative for conventional and fossil-based materials is an inevitable necessity. Scientists have shown that bio-based materials have great potential to be used in many industries and reduce adverse environmental impacts. Many industries like the plastic and textile industry have used bio-based materials and successfully reduced the impact. For example, Spierling et al. (2018)  showed that by substituting 65.8% of all plastic, bio-based plastics would emit 241 to 316 million tons less CO2 -eq than fossil-based plastics per year. Also, studies have shown bio-based materials in the textile and fashion industry will pave the way for implementing circular design strategies (Hildebrandt et al., 2021 ). But, one of the challenging industries where its significant environmental impacts are projected to increase in coming years is the building industry. The building industry is constantly consuming a significant quantity of natural resources and a huge amount of energy during the building lifetime (the design, construction, operation, maintenance, and the end-of-life phase) (Omer & Noguchi, 2020 ). The drastic growth of urbanization and megacities in the coming years will be associated with major raw material production and consumption of natural resources (Ribeiro & Gonçalves, 2019 ), in which a massive proportion of them would be allocated to building construction. Several studies have shown that the building industry is one of the most pollutant industries, with high contribution to the carbon budget and global warming (Hasik et al., 2019 ; Invidiata et al., 2018 ). The building sector consumes more than 32% of the entire global energy use (Zou et al., 2019 ). This sector is responsible for 40% of the natural resource consumption extracted in industrialized countries, 12% of the potable water use, and 70% of the electrical power consumption, and the production of 45%–65% of the waste placed in landfills (Castro-Lacouture et al., 2009 ; Franzoni, 2011 ; Pulselli et al., 2007 ). Also, the development of buildings annually consumes 60% of the crude stone, rock, and sand utilized overall and 30% of the crude timber (Sharma, 2020 ). Moreover, this sector is accountable for a significant amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, accounting for 30% used during the phase of operation and an additional 18% during transportation and material utilization (Sharma, 2020 ). These facts made researchers and scientists find solutions to reduce the wide range of environmental impacts that the building sector imposes on the environment and heat increases to the ecosystem. Utilizing bio-based materials in buildings as the substitute for fossil-based materials has been one of the main field of researcher's studies. Different types of bio-based materials have been utilized in buildings, and the results have shown promise. This substitution of building materials seems to be an excellent opportunity to move toward Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the building and infrastructure sectors. Therefore, this chapter aims to show the contribution of utilizing bio-based materials in buildings to SDGs.  2 Sustainable development goals In 2015, all the United Nations (UN) member states accepted the agenda for sustainable development as a universal call to action for improving life on Earth in all aspects, protecting the planet, conserving valuable resources, and providing prosperity worldwide until 2030. A set of global SDGs is at its heart, which embraces 17 goals and 169 targets (SDGs.UN, 2015 ). All of these 17 goals implicitly depend on each other (Nilsson et al., 2016 ), and if policymakers attempt to reach one goal without considering others, they risk negative outcomes. For instance, providing affordable and accessible energy for everyone (goal 7) with utilizing unsuitable resources can catalyze climate change (disrupting goal 13), as well as exacerbating health problems due to air pollution (undermining goal 3). Therefore, only if comprehensive actions are taken, the agenda can deliver its full potential.  3 Common bio-based building materials Bio-based building materials have gained worldwide attention due to their both environmental and economic benefits. They make an excellent opportunity for storing carbon in building components and compensate for the initial greenhouse gas emissions from construction operations. These materials have the potential to transform the future of sustainable building construction into a low-carbon or even a zero-carbon industry. For the purpose of decarbonization, it is important to take into consideration that retrofitting old buildings and energy efficiency have a high demand for the use of thermal insulation in construction industries, with them being the main contributors to the carbon budget. The serious concerns of energy performances in buildings based on environmental performances resulted in the attention to using natural organic materials and fiber insulations from the local ecosystem. Bio-based materials show interesting results on thermal conductivities. Different types of bio-based materials have been used in different building components and showed great potential. In this section, some of the most used and popular bio-based materials are introduced. 3.1 Hemp Hemp is one of the plant types of the Cannabis sativa  families that are cultivated for multiple usages. It has been stated that the oldest use of hemp dates back to 8000 BC where a scrap of hemp fabric is found to belong to that period (Tewari, 2018 ). Hemp has several ecological benefits. Due to the deep rooting system of hemp, it has desirable impacts on the soil structure and rejuvenates the soil in which it grows (Piotrowski & Carus, 2011 ; Tewari, 2018 ). Additionally, because of its vigorous growth, hemp is identified to be a pioneer plant that can be used for land reclamation (Piotrowski & Carus, 2011 ). Hemp is compatible with the requirements of organic farming because it can grow without the use of fungicides, herbicides, or pesticides. These organic compounds and most nitrogen-based fertilizers contribute to the considerable GHGs. Hemp can grow organically with absence of any fertilizers. Each part of this plant can be used in different applications in material industries. It is also one of the fastest-growing plants on Earth (Deitch, 2003 ), which makes it suitable for large-scale production. Industrial hemp has gained vast popularity in different industries like the construction industry for insulation purposes (Crini et al., 2020 ; Duque Schumacher et al., 2020 ; Stanković et al., 2019 ; Wang et al., 2003 ), bioenergy production (Ji et al., 2021 ; Parvez et al., 2021 ; Rehman et al., 2013 ; Rheay et al., 2021 ), or the paper industry (Ranalli & Venturi, 2004 ; van der Werf et al., 1994 ). Fig. 1  , made by Farinon et al. (2020) , shows some of the manifold applications of the hemp plant. The building industry is one of the industries that have been widely benefited from this vegetation. Hemp has been used in the construction industry in various ways and in different shapes. Hemp can be used as a feedstock for thermal insulation products (Dlimi et al., 2019 ). Hemp-based insulation has multiple advantages: possibility of reuse, excellent acoustic performance, low toxin level, convenient installation, robustness in handling and transportation, and vapor permeability (Lekavicius et al., 2015 ). Furthermore, hemp concrete (also known as hempcrete) is one of the most studied building materials in the construction industry (Jami et al., 2019 ; Vinay Kumar et al., 2021 ). Hemp concrete is a bio-composite that consists of hemp shiv and a lime-based binder composed from hydrated lime and either a pozzolanic or hydraulic binder (Arehart et al., 2020 ). It is considerable to mention that hemp concrete behavior is different in many ways from conventional building materials like cement blocks or red bricks. Hemp concrete has several valuable characteristics that make it a suitable alternative. Being lightweight, having low density, low thermal conductivity, excellent moisture buffer capability, and carbon-negative are only some hempcrete benefits (Jami et al., 2019 ).  3.2 Cork Cork is obtained from the outer bark of cork oak tree (Fig. 2  ) that mostly flourishes in Northern Africa and Southern Europe (Gil, 2009 ; Silva et al., 2005 ). Extraction of the outer bark of the cork tree is a sustainable practice. It does not damage the tree or endanger the biodiversity, and after the extraction, new bark regrows (Rives et al., 2012 ; Sierra-Pérez, López-Forniés, et al., 2016 ). Every 9–14 years, this process occurs, which depends on the area, until the tree is nearly 180–200 years old (Pereira & Tomé, 2004 ). The thickness and quality of the bark differ according to a tree's specific growth conditions (Costa et al., 2003 ). Most of the cork exploitation happens in Portugal and Spain. These two countries provide 80% of the cork extracted around the globe (around 161,504 tons) (Sierra-Pérez et al., 2015 ). The cork oak tree is one of the long-lived species with great environmental importance and has an essential part in ecological processes such as soil conservation, water retention, and carbon storage/sink (Rives et al., 2013 ; Sierra-Pérez, López-Forniés, et al., 2016 ). Cork, like other bio-based materials, has been used in a variety of applications. The use of natural and agglomerated cork in stoppers for alcoholic beverages is world-renowned (Canellas et al., 2021 ; Lauw et al., 2018 ; Oliveira & Pereira, 2020 ; Sousa et al., 2018 ). Cork applications in the building industry are so vast and expanded. Floor covering (Güngör, 2014 ) with composite cork tiles, used in green roof layers (Simões et al., 2020 ; Tadeu et al., 2019 ) and roof and wall insulation is only one of the cork applications in building (Silva et al., 2005 ). This popularity and wide applications of cork in different parts of buildings are due to its extraordinary characteristics. The good acoustic insulation properties of the cork make it a green and suitable choice to be used for room acoustic correction (Di Monte et al., 2013 ; Iannace et al., 2020 ; Maderuelo-Sanz et al., 2014 ). Cork's low thermal conductivity makes it an excellent choice for thermal insulation material in different parts of a building (Sierra-Pérez et al., 2018 ; Sierra-Pérez, Boschmonart-Rives, et al., 2016 ). Vibration isolation behavior of the cork-based materials encourages lots of engineers and designers to utilize these materials for different applications in the buildings (Gürgen & Sofuoğlu, 2021 ; Policarpo, 2012 ), such as using cork compounds in the sandwich structures for vibration damping (Santos Silva et al., 2009 ) or in the multi-laminated periodic bars (Policarpo et al., 2010 ).  3.3 Straw Straw stems from cereal crops such as wheat, oats, rye, rice, and barley are composed of nodes and internodes. Nearly 90% of cereal crop straw is made from lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose. The remaining constituents are water-soluble elements and ash, including silica (Harper & Lynch, 1981 ). For growth and through photosynthesis, for each 1.00 kg of straw, nearly 1.35 kg of CO2  is stored (Sodagar et al., 2011 ). Straw has gained considerable attention in recent years because of its tremendous potential and properties (Gan & Zhang, 2021 ; Wei et al., 2021 ). Applications of straw in buildings has an old history. In the old times, it was used for roofing, plaster substrates, bio-aggregates to lime and clay plasters, and as floor covering (Jones & Brischke, 2017 ). In modern construction, straw has an important position among the building materials. One of the reasons is that, besides storing carbon in the building, straw can be a great alternative material to reduce the dependency on using other high embodied energy materials (Koh & Kraniotis, 2020 ). Compressed blocks of straw (straw bale) are widely used in the construction sector. The first straw bale buildings were built in the late 1800s in Nebraska, USA, with the development of steam-powered baler (Marks, 2005 ). Straw bale panels can be used as the main material for constructing a sustainable building. Straw bale panels often framing with timber offer sufficient vertical load-bearing capacity (Walker et al., 2020 ). Most building materials have uncertain thermal conductivity due to the influences of moisture content, density, and temperatures. Straw has acceptable characteristics for different applications in buildings. Straw thermal conductivity differs with the moisture content. The thermal conductivity increases with the increase of moisture content. In straw bales, across the direction of compaction at a density of 120 kg/m, thermal conductivity is around 0.064 W/mK (Shea et al., 2012 ). Also, straw provides suitable acoustic insulation. Cascone et al. (2019)  compared straw bale-insulated walls with walls made with expanded polystyrene. They showed that the acoustic performance of the straw bale walls is far better than that of the walls containing traditional expanded polystyrene insulation (Cascone et al., 2019 ). Different studies have worked on the sound reduction value of rendered straw-bale walls, and they showed that it ranges around 43–55 dB (Goodhew et al., 2010 ; Wall et al., 2012 ). Also, the fire resistance of straw-bale has been investigated. For example, a test on a 30-mm lime-rendered straw bale showed that the rendered coats sustained full fire loading for nearly 90 min before failure (Wall et al., 2012 ), exceeding the 30- or 60-min ratings required for low-rise applications in the United Kingdom. Overall, straw possessing required characteristics as a building material is considered a sustainable bio-based material and has gained popularity in the building industry.  3.4 Flax Flax grows in temperate climates and is cultivated in large parts of Eastern and Western Europe, Russia, United States, Canada, India, Argentina, and China. Flax is one of the naturally available fibers that have been widely applied for different applications in the building industry. Compared with other natural fibers, flax has good mechanical properties (Prabhakaran et al., 2014 ). In terms of tensile strength, flax rates are highest among natural fibers (Femandez, 2002 ). Like other bio-based materials, the thermal properties of flax is one of its essential characteristics that have been widely investigated (Van de Velde & Baetens, 2001 ). In a study on flax straw, a thermal conductivity coefficient of 0.085 W/mK was achieved (Babenko et al., 2018 ). Moreover, shives from the stalk of the flax plant have been used in different applications. Flax shives have a complex and porous microstructure and have great potential as binders or filling materials (Benmahiddine et al., 2020 ). Flax board is manufactured using shives of the flax plant residue from the linen industry. Flax boards are engineered panels in which shives from the stalk of the flax plant are attached together with a synthetic resin adhesive. Numerous benefits and excellent properties of flax boards increased their use in the building industry. The natural characteristics and lightweight properties of flax boards, which benefit fire resistance, make them a suitable material for fire-resistant door cores and partitions. These panels also have found a use for room acoustics correction. Another study was presented on hygrothermal behavior using flax for insulation of traditional housing in building materials. The flax fulfilled the insulation role as well as the average temperature of the lowest, and the highest temperature was 10°C. Flax showed hygrothermal qualities for the renovation of traditional buildings in the context of the use of bulk insulation. Flax has low energy costs due to the productions as it is a by-product derived from farming (Brachelet et al., 2020 ). Altogether, flax characteristics and properties have made it an excellent bio-material to be used in the building industry. The growing demand for flax products in different industries shows the bright future of this material.  3.5 Bamboo Utilizing bamboo as building materials has been followed from ancient times and has been considered an important non-timber forest product with multiple applications. Since bamboo grows abundantly in tropical rain forests, it has been one of the primary materials for construction throughout the world's tropical and sub-tropical regions. In Nepal, Bhutan, and India, many bamboo homes called “Ekra” are hundreds of years old, which are simply built with bamboo-woven walls (Kewei & Frith, 2013 ). But traditional ways are obsolete, and using bamboo in modern construction is far different from its utilization in the past (Xiao & Li, 2015 ). The hollow internal structure of bamboo makes it lightweight, convenient to transport, and easy to work with. Giving to an approximation, nearly 2.5 billion people directly depend on bamboo for their living (mostly for fiber, food, and biomass ((Scurlock et al., 2000 ). Bamboo has amazing physical properties and mechanical characteristics. Density of bamboo species differs around 700 and 800 kg/m3 , and its tensile strength is around 28,000 lbf/in2 , which is considerably higher than that of steel (23,000 lbf/in2 ) (Kaur, 2018 ). The compressive strength of two bamboo species was tested in a study, and they were ranged between 45 and 65 N/mm2  (Lo et al., 2008 ). These results show the exceptional potential of this material in the construction industry. There are several cases where architects used bamboo as the main material for building energy-efficient buildings. Bamboo fiber is a revived cellulosic fiber created from bamboo (Das, 2010 ). Bamboo fiber found its place in the building sector as a cost-effective and eco-friendly material. This fiber has been used as reinforcement in composite materials (Zakikhani et al., 2014 ), concrete (Dewi & Wijaya, 2017 ), or insulation materials (Nguyen et al., 2017 ) in buildings. Overall, bamboo is one of the widely used materials not only in the construction and building sector but also in many other industries, which owes this popularity to its high strength and low weight.  3.6 Wood Wood has played a key role in all of the human activities over the centuries. It is a sustainable and renewable material that has been used for several purposes in various industries due to its versatility and excellent characteristics. The building construction sector has been one of the main consumers of wood throughout the history of mankind (Sathre & Gustavsson, 2009 ; Wang et al., 2014 ). In the 1950s and 1960s, on average, around 5.2 million tons of wood-based building materials were used annually (FAO, 1971 ). Due to the increased popularity of wood-based materials, this number reached 6.4 million tons between 1990 and 2010 (FAO/UNECEF, 2008 ; Fonseca, 2010 ; Hildebrandt et al., 2017 ). Furthermore, wood has the potential to resist decay with suitable treatment, and with appropriate construction methods and coatings, wood buildings can last hundreds of years. The mechanical properties of wood are the most important properties for building construction, especially when it is being used as a structural material. The physical and anatomical characteristics of wood like tracheid length, grain size, and wood density control its mechanical properties (Zhang, 1995 ). These properties can be changed by different environmental factors like moisture and temperature. Strength loss and the degradation magnitude of wood are directly linked to the severity of the thermal, biochemical, and chemical environment exposure (Rowell, 2005 ). It is expected that all natural materials have variations in their properties. Wood, also as a natural material, has shown significant variability in its properties. The reason for this variability is because trees are subject to several constantly changing influences like soil conditions, moisture, and growing space. Therefore, it is not possible to give a certain number for strength properties of wood. However, a great number of studies have assessed different wood species and showed not only acceptable mechanical properties but also low-embodied energy compared to other building materials (Bao et al., 2001 ; Gustavsson & Sathre, 2006 ; Kretschmann, 2010 ; Stark & Rowlands, 2003 ; Zhang, 1995 ). Hence, it is not surprising that wood-based materials are one of the most popular materials in the construction sector around the world. One of the main ways of utilizing wood in buildings is cross-laminated timber. It was first conceived in the 1980s by a German engineer and professor, Julius Natterer, and now it is one of the widely used construction materials around Europe and North America. Cross-laminated timber is one kind of prefabricated mass timber product that is made from gluing together layers of solid-sawn wood. In recent years, applications of cross-laminated timber have been greatly promoted due to lots of research studies that had been carried out in many countries like the United States, Canada, Austria, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, and Japan (Buchanan et al., 2008 ; Hindman & Bouldin, 2015 ; Rinaldin et al., 2013 ; Schickhofer, 2014 ). The cross-laminated timber has a great potential to be used as roof, wall, and floor panels, and also as decks or the main body structure of a bridge (Schubert et al., 2010 ). Cross-laminated timber has shown potential to be utilized in large and multi-storey buildings. The Stadthaus in Hackney, London, is a nine-storey residential building known as one of the world's tallest timber residential buildings (Xiong et al., 2016 ). This building, completed in 2009, was the first building of this height that had load-bearing walls, floor slabs, stairs, and lift cores completely made from cross-laminated timber panels (Wells, 2011 ). This building took only 49 weeks to complete, and during the construction, no injuries were recorded. Another example of tall and sustainable wooden buildings with cross-laminated timber is Forté. Forté is a 10-storey, 32.17 meters high apartment in the Port of Asia Victoria, Melbourne, Australia, built in 2012. All the shear walls in this building are constructed with cross-laminated timber (Li et al., 2019 ). Forté comprises 759 cross-laminated timber panels made of European spruce (Picea abies ). All of the panels in this building weighed an overall of 485 tons. The spruce for the cross-laminated timber panels was grown in Austria. The panels were manufactured and then shipped to Australia in 25 shipping containers. Utilizing cross-laminated timber panels in this building made it a perfectly environmental-friendly building that, compared to concrete and steel, reduced 1400 tons of CO2 -eq emissions (Wang et al., 2015 ). Besides reducing energy and water bills for residents, it is also estimated that by using timber in this building, 7.7 ML of water is saved, and eutrophication is reduced by 75%. These sustainable buildings have shown the great potential of bio-based materials like wood for large-scale construction. Utilizing these materials for building construction can have multiple benefits that need to be discussed. Reviewing these studies has proven that using bio-based materials in different building components can have much more than environmental benefits. Showing the contribution of bio-based building materials to SDGs can help understand other economic and social advantages of these materials in the building construction sector.   4 Contribution of building bio-based materials to SDGs Building materials and construction products are the main contributors to the GHGs due to the high demand for carbon usage and fossil fuel emissions from the production process to consumption. Bio-based materials compared with steel, concrete and aluminum have lower energy usage and act as carbon sinks, which means the reduction of CO2  emissions due to reducing the consumption of nonrenewable resources. This section mainly focuses on selected SDG goals that have more contributory factors on bio-based building materials. 4.1 Goal 1: End poverty With the increasing desire of the public to live in cities (85%–90% by 2100) (Luca, 2021 ) and a rapid increase in population in urban areas (Buhaug & Urdal, 2013 ), building and infrastructure development is in demand more than ever and the resource consumption rate is at its highest (Madlener & Sunak, 2011 ). All of these have resulted in the expensive cost of residence units, lack of enough units and high rents, and poor urban living environment (Ugochukwu & Chioma, 2015 ). Additionally, the cost of the materials used for buildings is an essential factor influencing housing affordability. Therefore, it is vital to use low-cost and local materials in buildings so low-income people can afford a house. This transformation to local and low-cost materials contributes to ending some forms of poverty in the urban area. For example, Krasny et al. (2017)  conducted a study to analyze and compare environmental impacts and costs of bio-based construction versus the building construction with concrete. They showed that bio-based houses not only are better in terms of being eco-friendly and energy-efficient, but also they are cheaper and economically justifiable to build than conventional buildings with brick/concrete. Using local and bio-based materials can cut the cost of construction by around 60% and has a significant impact on socioeconomics of the communities (Ugochukwu & Chioma, 2015 ) and increases the access of low-income people to decent houses with affordable costs (Varun Raj et al., 2021 ). Subsequently, utilizing local bio-based materials for buildings indirectly helps achieve target No. 1.4 which is ensuring that all women and men, especially the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, in addition to access to basic services, ownership, and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, and natural resources. These materials also help achieve target No. 1.5 which focuses on building the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social, and environmental shocks and disasters.  4.2 Goal 3: Ensure good health and promote well-being The number of studies about the impact of building materials on the health of residents has increased in recent years (Hadei et al., 2018 ; Sterling, 2018 ). Most people spend most of their time indoors (around 85%–90%) (Chen & Zhao, 2011 ). Studies have shown that indoor air is typically accountable for over 90% of human exposure to pollutants (Hoisington et al., 2019 ). Building materials have an essential role in indoor air quality, thermal comfort, and promoting well-being. Indoor air quality can be negatively affected by emissions from building materials and subsequently incur negative impacts on human health and well-being (Richter et al., 2021 ). These emissions include a wide range of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), and carbonyl compounds (including formaldehyde). Exposure to these organic compounds significantly impacts occupant health (Mhuireach et al., 2021 ). Several construction materials, such as flooring, insulation, cement, coatings, and roofing materials, constitute hazardous substances such as formaldehyde, polychlorinated biphenyls, mercury, lead-based paint, asbestos, and mercury that are considered carcinogenic and could impact on occupant's health as well as cause acute diseases and sick building syndrome (Kim & Yu, 2014 ; Passarelli, 2009; Petrović et al., 2017 ). Utilizing bio-based materials in buildings is a common method of remedying indoor air pollution problems (James & Yang, 2005 ) and contributing to healthier indoor zones and promoting well-being. To clarify the contribution of bio-based building materials to goal 3, many studies examined these materials, investigated their potential, and compared them to conventional materials (Maskell et al., 2015 ; Mhuireach et al., 2021 ; Richter et al., 2015 ; Richter et al., 2021 ). It has been indicated that the type and amount of VOCs released from wood or other bio-based material depend on many factors, including life history, type of plants/vegetation, interaction with biotic and abiotic factors, diseases, soil quality, irrigation, nutrition, weather and climate conditions, health of the plant, as well as its life cycle period (Stachowiak-Wencek & Pradzynski, 2014 ; Wolkoff, 1999 ). A study in China by measuring and analyzing the indoor air quality measuring the concentration of formaldehyde, VOCs, and TVOC of a modern bamboo house showed that with bamboo used as the building material, all the substance content measured were low and satisfied the indoor air quality health standards specified in China (Xiao et al., 2008 ). Therefore, promoting bio-based materials is essential since they prevent building occupants from diseases like cancer, lung diseases, respiratory infections, damaged liver, and central nervous system problems associated with hazardous chemicals emitted into the air from unsuitable building materials (Asikainen et al., 2016 ; Bartzis et al., 2008 ; Zhang et al., 2018 ).  4.3 Goal 4: Ensure quality education and lifelong learning opportunities for all Target No. 4.7 of this goal stated, “By 2030, ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, among others, thorough education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles”. Education, awareness, and training about the impacts of the various bio-based building materials on human health and the environment, as well as presenting the importance of using these materials in the construction industry toward climate action, are necessary. Specifying and educating the contribution of bio-based building materials to global warming and action toward SDGs are the keys to achieve a sustainable future and fostering next generation for having a sustainable lifestyle (Omer & Noguchi, 2020 ; Sichali & Banda, 2017; Umar & Khamidi, 2012 ). Moreover, utilizing bio-based materials for the construction of different educational facilities not only could be a real example of sustainable construction for learners but also increases public awareness about the benefits of bio-based materials and provide safe and healthy environments for future talents and generations and finally will increase the education's quality in terms of science-based knowledge and promote sustainability.  4.4 Goal 6: Ensure availability of clean water and sanitation for all The growing global water crisis highlights the importance of finding alternative ways for reducing water consumption and managing water resources. The construction industry is in charge of 16% of water consumption in the world (Heravi & Abdolvand, 2019 ). Thus, water consumption in the construction sector directly influences water scarcity and needs to be reduced. During the extraction and processing of the raw materials, and in the production stage and throughout the building construction, building materials consumes a massive amount of water. Selecting building materials that have high embodied water must be avoided. For example, as one of the most used and essential materials for construction, concrete is responsible for a significant amount of water consumption. For evaluating the amount of water consumption related to concrete production, Miller et al. (2018)  conducted a study and showed that concrete production was responsible for 9% of global industrial water withdrawal, nearly 1.7% of total global water withdrawal. They projected that in 2050, 75% of the water demand for concrete production will occur in regions that are likely to experience water stress. Therefore, it is vital to find solutions for reducing the significant amount of water consumption from the construction sector. The water footprints of conventional building materials can be considerably reduced by making use of water-efficient alternative materials (Abd El-Hameed, 2018 ). Bio-based materials have shown promise to be a suitable alternative that can reduce the water footprint. For example, Bolin and Smith (2011)  performed a life cycle assessment analysis to compare borate-treated lumber with galvanized steel framing used for decking. They showed that the use of galvanized steel framing needs 83 times the amount of water used for borate-treated lumber. Besides, using borated-treated lumber instead of galvanized steel will result in 1.8 times less GHG emissions, 3.5 times less acidification, and 2.8 times less ecological impacts (Bolin & Smith, 2011 ). On the other hand, some building materials, when directly contacted with water, produce chemical hazards. Chemical pollutants, especially arsenic, lead, and toxic chemicals entering into the water bodies, can cause serious negative impacts on human health like cancer (Joshi et al., 2022 ). Utilizing bio-based materials as an alternative to fossil-based materials have the potential to reduce pollution, minimize the release of hazardous chemicals, and afterward improve the quality of water.  4.5 Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy for all In every stage during their lifetime, building materials consumes a significant amount of energy. These stages include extraction of the raw materials, manufacturing phase, transportation of materials to the construction site, assembly and installation, energy used for maintenance of materials during the operation phase, and finally, the energy required for demolition and transportation of the wastes to the recycling site or for reusing purposes or to the land field at the end of building life (Bribián et al., 2011 ; Huberman & Pearlmutter, 2008 ). Therefore, it is no surprise that the construction and operation of buildings are responsible for around 48% of global energy consumption (considering both embodied and operating energy) (Dixit, 2019 ). Using bio-based materials as low-embodied materials in building construction is a sustainable approach to reduce the energy consumption related to the building industry (Lupíšek et al., 2015 ). To show the great environmental potential of wood, Asif (2009)  compared the energy and environmental performance of this material with those of other common construction materials. The results showed that the embodied energy of wood is 1.65 Gj/m3 , aluminum is 497 Gj/m3 , concrete is 4.8 Gj/m3 , and PVC is 116 Gj/m3 . This superiority of wood over other materials is the same in other environmental factors like global warming potential, acidification potential, and photochemical ozone creation potential. Also, bamboo has been investigated as a low-embodied energy material for different uses in the building. Likewise, bamboo as an energy-efficient material (2.4 Gj/m3 ) has been evaluated as a potential building material to reach energy efficiency in buildings (Noerwasito & Nirwansyaha, 2015 ). One important point about the bio-based building materials is that they are often used as local materials (if a sustainability approach was taken and long-distance transportation avoided), so the energy consumption due to the transportation would not be added to their embodied energy. Therefore, it is apparent that utilizing bio-based materials in building construction is a suitable approach toward SDG 7.  4.6 Goal 8: Decent work and economic growth Target 4 of this goal stated, “improve progressively, through 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption and production and endeavor to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation.” However, due to significant population growth and rapid urbanization, overconsumption of natural resources occurred in recent decades, and utilization of fossil-based materials for construction drastically increased. It is crucial to use sustainable and eco-friendly alternative building materials to achieve this target of sustainable development in the construction industry. A circular bio-economy is the sustainable approach toward the achievement of SDGs by 2030. Considering bio-economy strategies and monitoring and assessing their indicators need in-depth investigations based on different countries and the natural resources, climatic factors, ecosystem coverages, and available local materials shown in Table 1   (Linser & Lier, 2020 ). Bio-based materials not only can help achieve resource efficiency on a global scale but also throughout their life cycle processes like material extraction, production and manufacturing process, and installation and maintenance, which can get a wide variety of people with different skills involved and promote economic growth. Additionally, through the global attention that green buildings gained in recent years, the demand for green and bio-based materials has also increased, which is accompanied by employing many people from various disciplines, which can cause promotion of economic growth and employment.  4.7 Goal 9: Building resilient infrastructure, promoting sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation Target No. 1 of this goal stated, “develop quality, reliable, sustainable, and resilient infrastructure, including regional and transborder infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all”. There is a direct connection between developing reliable, sustainable, and resilient infrastructure and developing alternative, low-embodied energy, environmentally safe, and durable materials such as bio-based materials (Pour-Ghaz, 2013 ). Developing bio-based materials and improving their characteristics will promote cost-effective, adaptable, and green infrastructure, which can face global challenges due to climate change. One type of green infrastructure that is incorporated into buildings is green roofs (Bevilacqua, 2021 ). Green roofs have gained much popularity due to their many benefits and ecosystem services such as air pollution reduction (Currie & Bass, 2008 ; Yang et al., 2008 ), urban heat island effect reduction (Asadi et al., 2020 ; Kolokotsa et al., 2013 ; Yang et al., 2018 ), storm water retention (VanWoert et al., 2005 ), and reducing the energy consumption of buildings (Movahed et al., 2021 ). There have been various studies that utilized different bio-based materials in green roofs. Nagase (2020)  used bamboo stems and bamboo nodes in the drainage layer of a green roof and observed that bamboo functions as acceptable as a commercial green roof material. Even bamboo nodes caused higher final plant coverage than commercial drainage layers (Nagase, 2020 ). In a study, Almeida et al. (2019)  evaluated a green roof system that substitutes the conventional drainage layer and water storage polyethylene membranes with insulation cork boards. They observed that the corkboard provided higher insulation capacity than conventional polyethylene membranes. After getting wet, the insulation corkboard layer was found to recover its performance more quickly than the substrate layer (Almeida et al., 2019 ). These two studies have shown the great potential of bio-based materials in green infrastructure like green roofs. Using bio-based materials in cases like green roofs can help achieve target No. 4 of SDG 9 that stated, “upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes”.  4.8 Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities Providing access to safe, adequate, and affordable housing and basic services for all people is a critical matter since the cities’ population is expected to increase drastically (Bredenoord, 2016 ; Buhaug & Urdal, 2013 ; Luca, 2021 ). Although cities occupy only 2% of the land area in the world, they are responsible for about 70%–80% of worldwide carbon emissions and over 60%–75% of resource use (Churkina, 2008 ; Su et al., 2020 ; UNEP, 2012 ). All of these imply that there is a vital need to apply sustainable strategies and approaches for urban planning and construction. The foundations of cities and communities are the buildings, and the way buildings are constructed and what materials are used in them affect cities’ sustainability. Using locally available and bio-based building materials can reduce construction costs and minimize the adverse environmental impacts of the buildings (Bredenoord, 2017 ; Kayode & Olusegun, 2013 ). For example, Quintana-Gallardo et al. (2021)  suggested using rice straw for building products as a raw material in Valencia, Spain. They stated that more than 75,000 tons of rice straw generated after the harvest are mixed with the soil or burned every year, where both practices emit greenhouse gases and have enormous impacts on the environment and the population of surrounding areas. Therefore, they presented building façade panels made with rice straw as an alternative to the conventional double-layered façades made with brick that are widely used in this area. After carrying out a life cycle analysis, it was observed that the façade with rice straw emits 80% less CO2  equivalent than the conventional brick wall. Analysis showed that if the emissions of mixing the straw with the soil or burning the straw are subtracted, each square meter of rice straw façade prevents the emission of 52.64 kg of CO2  equivalent and 18.85 kg of CO2  equivalent. Results indicated that using rice straw as an alternative to conventional materials offers environmental benefits (Quintana-Gallardo et al., 2021 ). In a study in Sweden, Leyder et al. (2021)  compared a timber-hybrid building structure with a pure reinforced concrete structure. The timber-hybrid structure has half of the non-renewable energy consumption and half the greenhouse gas emissions compared to the reinforced concrete alternative. Therefore, the enormous environmental benefits of these bio-based building materials for CO2  emission reduction must not be neglected. Other studies have shown that using bio-based concrete such as hempcrete or crushed rape straw concrete in the construction sector also is considered a sustainable approach for developing cities and building affordable houses (Laidoudi et al., 2015 ). Overall, these showed the clear ecological advantages of using bio-based building materials and their crucial role in sustainable cities.  4.9 Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production The global material footprint increased by 70% between 2000 and 2017. Similarly, consumption of domestic materials per capita increased by more than 40%, from 8.7 m3  in 2000 to 12.2 m3  in 2017 (SDGs.UN, 2021a ). One of the main targets of goal 12 is to achieve sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources and encourage companies to adopt sustainable practices. The companies active in the building material industry play an essential role in promoting sustainable consumption and production by supporting the use of alternative, responsibly sourced, green, and environmentally safe materials like bio-based materials. Bio-based materials are promising in terms of sustainable patterns for consumption and production. One of the main concerns in cities is the management of construction and demolition wastes. Targets 4 and 5 of goal 12 have focused on managing chemicals and wastes throughout their life cycle or reducing the waste generation to decrease their release to air, water, and soil in order to minimize their negative impacts on human health and the environment. Bio-based materials play a significant role in reducing construction wastes through their ability for reusing and recycling. For example, wood waste contributes to an enormous share of the whole building construction wastes (Poon et al., 2001 ). Sustainable approaches have been proposed to reach the best strategy for wood waste management. In order to compare different management strategies for wood waste generated from building activities, Hossain and Poon (2018)  conducted a life cycle assessment. They proposed three alternative scenarios, including recycling and reusing wood waste to 1-produce organic polymer-based particleboard, 2-cement-bonded particleboard, and 3-energy generation. These scenarios were compared with the typical disposal strategy that is currently used (landfill disposal). Major reductions of adverse environmental impacts were observed for scenario 1 (particleboard production) and scenario 2 (wood-cement composite) from wood waste compared to that of using virgin wood. However, scenario 3 (energy generation from bio-fuel derived from wood waste) was the best strategy since this technology decreases more than 1 ton of CO2 -eq compared to the energy generation from coal. Therefore, one of the advantages of bio-based materials is the multiple options that are possible for sustainable management of their wastes. In another study in China, Yu et al. (2011)  analyzed bamboo-structure buildings and compared them with the typical brick-concrete buildings. With similar functional requirements, the bamboo-structure building required less energy and emitted less carbon dioxide. Regarding the waste generated through demolition and construction of the bamboo-structure building, the potential of the recycling strategy is to offset 51.3% of the total embodied energy and 69.2% of the total embodied carbon (Yu et al., 2011 ). This shows that bamboo, like many other bio-based materials, has excellent environmental advantages and assists in reaching SDG 12.  4.10 Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change The six years from 2015 to 2020 are estimated to be the warmest on record (SDGs.UN, 2021b ). Despite the temporary reduction in emissions associated with measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, atmospheric concentrations of the main GHGs continued to increase. Global emissions must be reduced to 45% below 2010 levels by 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The emissions from developed countries were nearly 6.2% lower in 2019 than in 2010, while emissions from 70 developing countries increased by 14.4% in 2014 (SDGs.UN, 2021b ). In order to reduce the emissions to the defined targets, it is necessary that sectors and industries which have the most emissions be recognized and comprehensive actions for reducing their emissions implemented. The building industry is one of the largest sources of GHG emissions. However, a suitable selection of building materials can significantly mitigate the building sector impacts on global GHG emissions since building materials are one of the major contributors to direct and indirect emissions and other climate-related hazards. There is an excellent opportunity to reduce emissions through environmentally friendly, low-embodied energy materials like bio-based materials (Arıoğlu Akan et al., 2017 ; Hertwich et al., 2019 ; Hong et al., 2015 ). Not only bio-based materials have lower emissions than conventional building materials, but also some of them, like hemp, are carbon negative and can store carbon in different parts of a building (Kristombu Baduge et al., 2019 ). Pittau et al. (2018)  stated that bio-based materials, such as hemp and straw, offer a promising opportunity to considerably reduce the carbon footprint of buildings. The capacity for storing carbon increases when these materials are used as large insulation exterior walls. Additionally, concepts like “buildings as a global carbon sink” have been introduced in order to combat climate change in the building sector (Amiri et al., 2020 ; Arehart et al., 2021 ; Churkina et al., 2020 ; Craig et al., 2020 ; Pomponi et al., 2020 ). For example, using timber to construct buildings is one way to turn buildings into carbon sinks. The carbon storage in buildings that are built with timber will offset some of the temporary reductions of carbon stock in forests, which will regrow and continue to absorb carbon from the atmosphere (Churkina et al., 2020 ). The rate of carbon transfers from forests and total storage of carbon in the timber buildings depends on the fraction of future buildings that are designed with timber. Strategies for future urban planning and the amount of bio-based material used in buildings are essential factors in reducing carbon emission from cities and achieve goal 13.  4.11 Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use of the oceans, seas and marine resources Although buildings are built on land, their impacts move to oceans. Rainwater passes through the materials of the roofs, facades, and roadways and enters the adjacent rivers and seas. Materials of a building can be a permanent source of pollutants and can lead to severe persistent toxicity and bioaccumulation to the marine environment, plants, and animals. Dead zones in oceans (areas of water that lack sufficient oxygen to support marine life) rose from 400 in 2008 to 700 in 2019 due to significant nutrient pollution discharged into oceans (SDGs.UN, 2021b ). Therefore, it is crucial to select the building materials considering their impacts on the life below water. Roof runoff is generally considered a clean source of water and is often discharged to rivers and seas or used without any treatment, but studies have shown that it is an entirely inaccurate perception, and runoff quality from roofs should not be overlooked before the discharge (De Buyck et al., 2021 ). Charters et al. (2016)  described the runoff quality from roof and road surfaces in a low-intensity rainfall climate. They showed that metal roofs (copper and galvanized roofs) are major sources of zinc and copper, mainly in dissolved form. Moreover, runoff quality from vegetated roofs have been widely investigated (Liu et al., 2021 ; Rocha et al., 2021 ; Van Seters et al., 2009 ). Vijayaraghavan and Joshi (2014)  examined the potential of green roofs to act as sinks for pollutants. Green roof substrate was prepared using sand, crushed brick, perlite, vermiculite, perlite, and coco-peat, and compared with local garden soil based on the improvement of runoff quality. The results showed that the vegetated green roof assemblies produced runoff with better quality and with less total metal ion concentration and conductivity than un-vegetated assemblies. Generally, these studies have shown the importance of building materials, especially roof materials, on runoff water quality. Some bio-based materials such as bamboo, reed, and wood have great potential to be used as roofing materials. Investigating the effects of these materials on water quality is important to achieve SDG 14.  4.12 Goal 15: Life on land Ecosystems and biodiversity are under extreme pressure as a result of the rapid development of cities and buildings on the land. The natural habitats and species in the quarrying sites can be destroyed or get damaged through quarrying and mining of building materials (Sahu & Dash, 2011 ). Also, all the operations related to material extraction require a great amount of water and energy, and they can cause air and water pollution and generate large quantities of wastes (Fugiel et al., 2017 ). Hence, promoting the use of green and responsibly sourced building materials is essential to reach target 5 of this goal (take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats) (SDGs.UN, 2021c ). Bio-based building materials are considered green alternatives that can reduce the adverse environmental impacts of conventional material extraction. If the content of bio-based material in a building increased, the adverse environmental impacts of the building would be reduced (Peñaloza et al., 2016 ). Also, due to the advantage of bio-based materials for getting reused or recycled, utilizing them in buildings provides a sustainable built environment that leads to a good functioning ecosystem for sustaining life and biodiversity. Since the built environment plays a major role in reducing biodiversity loss (Opoku, 2019 ) and sustainable built environments promote biodiversity.  4.13 Goal 17: Global partnership for sustainable development goals Utilizing bio-based materials in buildings require partnership from different sectors. There needs to be harmonized cooperation between the different sectors from the supply of raw materials, transportation from production or cultivation place, manufacturing (including drying, sawing, planning, sanding, gluing, and packaging), and construction and maintenance to end of life. In some cases, when the supply of bio-based material is from a foreign country, a global partnership is needed for reaching sustainable supply chain management. Therefore, promoting the use of bio-based materials in buildings strengthens the partnership between the different construction sectors and builds up a global partnership to achieve Goal 17. Overall, this study found bio-based building materials contribute to 13 goals out of the 17 goals of the UN 2030 agenda. This considerable potential shows the bright future of these materials and indicates the need to satisfy future demand with comprehensive planning for enough supply. However, some challenges face bio-based material production that needs to be addressed.   5 Challenges 5.1 Land availability and land competition Counting on biomass for different sectors like construction can only result in GHG emission reduction if sustainable agriculture and forest management are guaranteed. Manufacturing of bio-based materials encompasses major land use for the growth of the required biomass. There have been concerns about agricultural or forest management, and questions have arisen regarding land use and land competition between sectors. Due to the limitation of natural resources, land use competition is imposed between interest groups for wood and other bio-based materials (Manuschevich et al., 2019 ), which led to conflicts between sectors (Bonsu et al., 2019 ). Additionally, improving wealth around the world is followed by an increase in meat consumption per capita. Satisfying the food demand requires changing land use since producing meat needs significantly more land than producing crops and is coupled with a decline of agricultural land (Haberl, 2015 ; Muradian & Martinez-Alier, 2001 ; Smith et al., 2010 ). Göswein et al. (2021)  evaluated land availability and land change for shifting toward bio-based buildings in Europe. Four alternative construction technologies, made with wood, cork, hemp, and straw, were assessed for renovation and new construction of the European building stock until 2050. They expressed that 9.4 billion m2  of roofs and walls require to be built or renovated in the European Union by 2050. The annual needed construction materials were calculated and converted into raw biomass, and the equivalent required land. The examination indicated that the amount of currently available land for growing straw and wood is sufficient to meet the future evolution of the building in every European region stock. Contrarily, currently available land to grow hemp and cork is only enough to supply local uses and is not feasible for large-scale supply. It was indicated that the land required for hemp shiv production covers only 2% of the demand, and in many countries, stringent legislation limited its future development. Straw was highly recommended for large-scale construction and renovation due to its highest cumulative carbon storage potential until 2050. Furthermore, excessive use of some bio-based materials can result in deforestation, which will lead to loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and major CO2  emissions. Many cases showed overexploitation of wood for different uses resulted in major deforestation (Ngwira & Watanabe, 2019 ). Austin et al. (2019)  expressed that large-scale oil palm and timber plantations together were responsible for more than 40% of nationwide deforestation in Indonesia. As forests become a scarcer resource, the price of timber will increase and public access to timber for construction will be reduced. Therefore, the necessity for sustainable management of forest and agricultural lands is more than ever.  5.2 Water consumption and availability Water is at the core of sustainability and the most essential requirement for life on Earth. For the bio-based material production, water is the most critical factor. In recent years, irresponsible approaches toward water resources and climate change put intense stress on water resources and increase the need for water resource management. To take a sustainable approach for utilizing bio-based materials in the construction industry, it is urgent to consider the water consumption of the materials. Also, water existence is an essential factor that has a major influence on the growth, morphological, physiological compatibility, and development of a plant under environmental conditions. Water scarcity will reduce crop yield. Water availability reduction because of drought reduces the water potential of plant tissues, which will prevent growth, close stomata, reduce photosynthesis and respiration rate, and increases the ascorbic acid accumulation (Bahador & Tadayon, 2020 ; Sankar et al., 2007 ; Shao et al., 2009 ). Bahador and Tadayon (2020) , in Shahrekord, Iran, investigated the role of zeolite in modifying the impact of drought stress in hemp. A 2-year experiment was carried out in the experimental field of Shahrekord University. The result showed that zeolite significantly kept the process of antioxidant enzymes near to suitable conditions and reduced their activity. Water deficit had shown different negative impacts on hemp traits, but zeolite showed to be a potential solution for reducing these negative impacts. Therefore, it is necessary to implement sustainable approaches for reducing the negative impacts of water deficiency. Besson et al. (2014)  investigated the physiological responses of cork oak to water shortage in droughts. It was indicated that exclusion of rainfall reduced the annual stand canopy transpiration by 10% over the 2-year study period. Cork oak physiology and growth showed to be critically sensitive to spring precipitations, and future changes in precipitation patterns due to climate change will severely affect the cork oak trees. The results of this study also showed that water shortage considerably reduced leaf area. Hence, water availability is a crucial matter for developing bio-based materials.  5.3 Pollutions and adverse environmental impacts Bio-based building materials passes through various stages and processes to get to the use point. The adverse environmental impacts of these materials during different stages should not be ignored in strive to achieve sustainability in the building industry. In a review study of the environmental Impacts of bio-based materials, Weiss et al. (2012)  expressed that one metric ton of bio-based materials compared to conventional materials may increase stratospheric ozone depletion by 1.9±1.8 kg nitrous oxide-equivalents and eutrophication by 5±7 kg phosphate-equivalents. For instance, corkboard is one of the most popular building materials that have considerable environmental impacts. Insulation corkboard has a wide range of use in a building (e.g., walls, roofs, and floors) and due to its good thermal conductivity, perforation vulnerability, adaptability, and robustness have gained huge popularity. However, some studies have shown that the insulation corkboard does not certainly imply a reduction of adverse environmental impacts. Sierra-Pérez, Boschmonart-Rives, et al. (2016)  assessed the environmental impacts of corkboard insulation and indicated that due to low technological development in manufacturing processes, the most impactful stage for most of the environmental impact categories is the manufacturing stage. This is due to the enormous quantities of electricity and diesel that are consumed at this stage. Improving the energy efficiency of manufacturing processes is crucial to reduce the environmental impacts of corkboards. Promoting the procurement of local bio-based materials to reduce transportation from the manufacturing site is another strategy to reduce the adverse environmental impacts of these materials. Working on other sustainable approaches to decrease the negative environmental impacts of bio-based materials is necessary to encourage their use in the building industry.   6 Conclusion The building industry is one of the largest contributors to global warming. One of the best ways to reduce the adverse environmental impacts of the building construction industry is substituting fossil-based materials with bio-based materials. Different kinds of bio-based materials have been tested in different building components and have shown great potential. Hemp, cork, flax, straw, bamboo, and wood are some of the most used bio-based building materials that have gained worldwide popularity. Utilizing these materials brings significant environmental benefits and also offers economic and social advantages. The choice of materials cannot be generalized for all infrastructure industries. This is necessary to emphasize that every individual area based on the type of ecosystem needs in-depth evaluation and investigations to understand the climate conditions and application of suitable bio-based materials or recycling materials from waste. Therefore, it is important to understand the science and knowledge behind each bio-based material and its application to be implemented in. In this chapter, it is shown that if bio-based building materials get used appropriately in buildings, they can contribute to 13 goals of SDGs. This contribution shows the huge potential of these materials and specifies that more attention is needed for sustainable supply of them. On the other hand, some challenges like land availability, water consumption, and emitting pollutions face large-scale production of bio-based materials. Overall, bio-based building materials are promising and offer multiple benefits, but they still need more attention to find their real place in the building construction industry.
