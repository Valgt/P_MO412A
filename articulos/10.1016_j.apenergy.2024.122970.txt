                  The 2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a set of aspirational objectives for the world, addressing interlinked themes including poverty, hunger, and climate action. Meeting these goals requires a similarly integrated and interdisciplinary approach. One component of such an approach may be agrivoltaic systems (AVS): dual use solar and agricultural systems wherein crops are grown beneath and between solar panels. Given their intersectoral nature, AVS will have complex impacts on the achievement of the SDGs. This analysis seeks to evaluate how AVS could impact progress towards the SDGs based on literature around the impacts of agriculture, solar, and AVS, and the indicators measuring progress towards the SDGs. It uses a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) framework and applies it in a unique way to understand the direct and immediate impacts to the SDGs following the installation of an AVS (i.e., strengths and weaknesses), and the potential impacts on the SDGs based on secondary or supplementary actions taken once an AVS is installed (i.e., opportunities and threats). Though the most obvious of AVS' impacts to the SDGs will be on Goals 2 (Zero Hunger) and 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), evaluation of individual indicators shows that AVS can quantifiably impact 14 out of 17 SDGs, largely in a positive manner. However, evaluating impacts on the SDGs indicator by indicator also reveals possible negative, and unexpected, consequences of AVS. Yet, impacts on the SDGs will vary by location-specific factors such as climate, and so this analysis concludes with an application of the SWOT framework in Ethiopia for a farm where an AVS is under consideration. Altogether, this work should provide a means for evaluating the impacts of AVS on SDGs and insights into how to mitigate possible detrimental impacts while capitalizing on benefits.

Fig. 3   Table 1 Summary of impacts of AVS on SDG Goals with respect to single use solar (SUS) and single use agriculture (SUA).  Table 1   SDG Goal Explanation   1. Zero Poverty    Relative to SUA, AVS increase farmer incomes by supplementing agricultural income with solar power sales (strength).  2. No Hunger    Relative to SUA, adding solar panels to fields will often reduce the absolute quantity of yields per land unit (weakness). Relative to SUS, AVS will always increase land under agricultural activity (strength).  3. Good Health and Well-being    In rural, agricultural areas with low electrification, AVS can help electrify nearby healthcare facilities relative to SUA (opportunity).  4. Quality Education    In rural, agricultural areas with low electrification, AVS can help electrify nearby educational facilities, enabling lighting for extended study hours and access to charging for computers and other technology relative to SUA (opportunity).  5. Gender Equality    It is possible that adding electricity sources for lighting may extend labor hours for women relative to SUA (threat), the indicator for Goal 5 that is relevant to AVS.  6. Clean Water and Sanitation    Shading from solar panels reduces evapotranspiration relative to SUA (strength) while the ability to reuse water for washing panels for irrigating crops below panels increases the water-use efficiency relative to SUS (strength).  7. Affordable and Clean Energy    Relative to SUA, AVS add renewable electricity generation (strength). Relative to SUS, AVS reduce the amount of renewable electricity generated per land unit (weakness).  8. Decent Work and Economic Growth    Given the potential to integrate electricity generation into rural areas, AVS may be used to power skills training facilities and microbusinesses relative to both SUA and SUS (opportunity).  9. Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure    Relative to SUA, AVS increase low emission renewable electricity generation (strength).

Meeting these goals requires a similarly integrated and interdisciplinary approach. One component of such an approach may be agrivoltaic systems (AVS): dual use solar and agricultural systems wherein crops are grown beneath and between solar panels. Given their intersectoral nature, AVS will have complex impacts on the achievement of the SDGs. This analysis seeks to evaluate how AVS could impact progress towards the SDGs based on literature around the impacts of agriculture, solar, and AVS, and the indicators measuring progress towards the SDGs. It uses a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) framework and applies it in a unique way to understand the direct and immediate impacts to the SDGs following the installation of an AVS (i.e., strengths and weaknesses), and the potential impacts on the SDGs based on secondary or supplementary actions taken once an AVS is installed (i.e., opportunities and threats). Though the most obvious of AVS' impacts to the SDGs will be on Goals 2 (Zero Hunger) and 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), evaluation of individual indicators shows that AVS can quantifiably impact 14 out of 17 SDGs, largely in a positive manner. However, evaluating impacts on the SDGs indicator by indicator also reveals possible negative, and unexpected, consequences of AVS. Yet, impacts on the SDGs will vary by location-specific factors such as climate, and so this analysis concludes with an application of the SWOT framework in Ethiopia for a farm where an AVS is under consideration. Altogether, this work should provide a means for evaluating the impacts of AVS on SDGs and insights into how to mitigate possible detrimental impacts while capitalizing on benefits.

The SDGs outline seventeen objectives aimed at global challenges like poverty, inequality, climate change, and environmental degradation, each of which is accompanied by detailed targets and indicators to measure progress. The SDGs are, by nature, deeply intertwined; they lend themselves to investments and programs that target multiple objectives. One such investment may be agrivoltaic systems (AVS), the co-location of solar power and agricultural activity (Fig. 1  ), with solar panels installed above and between rows of crops. Though the concept was first proposed in the 1980s [2 ], it has attracted increasing attention and research in the last decade [3 ]. These dual-use systems are inherently intersectoral [4 ]; electricity is generated on land that simultaneously produces crops, with impacts on the microclimate below and between panels. Agrivoltaic systems have been proposed to attenuate possible land use conflicts between the solar energy and agriculture sectors. Agriculture uses approximately 38% of global land surface [5 ] and much of this land is considered well-suited to solar power [6 ], which has a large land footprint relative to conventional forms of electricity generation [7 ]. In some areas, tensions between the public, farmers, and solar developers have led to protests halting proposed projects [8 ]. Such tensions may grow as countries accelerate renewable energy development; in Japan and South Korea, for example, estimates suggest that over 5% of land may be required to meet 2050 solar capacity targets [9 ], with global estimates ranging from 135 to 165 million acres [10 ]. One challenge in comprehensively quantifying the benefits of AVS is their limited adoption – 2200 projects pairing solar power with crop cultivation accounted for 2.8 GW of global capacity in 2020 [11 ], a fraction of the over 1100 GW of solar capacity [12 ]. However, the number of pilot projects and modelling experiments has steadily increased, covering crops such as lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, peppers, grapes, agave, and rice, inter alia  [13–25 ]. In addition, a growing number of countries have established government support for AVS, beginning with Japan in 2012 and extending to countries such as China, France, Germany, Israel, and the United States [26 ]. Government support of AVS is motivated by several factors, including the prospect of improved land productivity, increased farm income, and support of national development programs. Although the impacts of AVS have thus far only been documented for a select number of crops, the systems are likely to provide benefits to many others. In every case, AVS increases the outputs from a farm by adding electricity generation, a higher value product than most crops. In terms of both development and national security, AVS can complement electrification schemes. Like standalone solar, AVS can provide a decentralized source of electricity to households and farms, especially in rural areas where grid connections may be infeasible [27 ,28 ]. In East and West Africa, for example, such decentralized systems can provide the same or better levels of reliability at equivalent costs to existing or planned grid expansions [28 ]. Promotion of AVS can also be paired with other government initiatives. For example, AVS can provide high-skilled jobs with training opportunities in science, technology, and engineering sectors. Consequently, implementation of AVS may have extensive impacts on achievement of multiple SDGs, both positive and negative. One type of framework for analyzing positive and negative aspects of a business or technology is Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat (SWOT) analysis, which has been used to assess business strategies since the 1960s [29 ]. In a traditional SWOT analysis, businesses identify internal  characteristics that place them at an advantage (strength) or disadvantage (weakness) relative to their competitors [30 ]. External  factors, which are those within the broader business, physical, political, or institutional environment, can similarly provide conditions that can benefit (opportunities) or jeopardize (threats) the business. The value of SWOT analyses is explicitly identifying factors that are directly related to a business or technology and those that are outside of direct control – factors that can be matched to establish a strategy maximizing benefits and minimizing risks. The SWOT framework has been applied extensively to the energy sector, including for renewable energy broadly [31–33 ], hydropower [34 ], nuclear power [35 ], hydrogen fuels [36 ], solar power [37 ], and wind power [38 ]. Most recently, it has also been applied to AVS [39 ,40 ]. However, while several researchers have noted the possible connections between AVS and the SDGs, e.g., [41 ], few have explored the impacts installing AVS can have on the goals and identified the discrete metrics impacted (i.e., indicators and associated measurements). One notable exception is a review evaluating the impact of all forms of AVS (i.e., dual use with cropland, animal husbandry, and natural habitat) on ecosystem services, and how these impacts can positively influence progress towards 15 out of the 17 SDGs [10 ]. However, this analysis is limited to ecosystem services, and does not specify impacts to individual indicators that are used to measure progress towards each SDG. In addition, there is little mention of negative impacts AVS may have, or how the link between AVS and the SDGs may change based on whether land use shifts from agriculture only to dual use or solar only to dual use. This paper seeks to build on the existing literature by identifying the measurable ways in which AVS may benefit or hinder progress towards the SDGs. A SWOT framework is first used to assess how AVS may broadly impact the SDGs; it is not exclusively a SWOT of AVS, but instead of how AVS impact achievement of the SDGs. This framework is then applied to a small city in Ethiopia, Debre Berhan, where installation of AVS is currently being considered, to highlight how impacts of AVS on the SDGs will vary based on the context in which they are implemented. This analysis should be useful to policymakers, particularly in low and lower middle-income countries (LICs/LMICs), who are focused on meeting the SDGs and, more broadly, who are interested in increasing land productivity.  2 Methods Though the idea behind AVS is simple, implementation varies by installation. Some systems are energy-centric, meaning that they prioritize solar power generation at the expense of agricultural yields, while others are agriculture-centric, meaning that panel layouts are designed to reduce impacts on yields. Though there is no strict definition for the type of layout that comprises an AVS, for our purpose we will adopt an approach limiting AVS to dual use solar and cropland (i.e., no animal husbandry or pollinator habitat), juxtaposed against single  land uses. In this analysis, a farm with several planted acres and other separate acres solely dedicated to solar is not  considered an AVS as the two uses are independent of each other. Nor is a system with panels located on the roof an AVS. Instead, we define an AVS as a system of any size or layout wherein crops are co-located with panels, either directly underneath or between rows. Therefore, benefits or harms derived from AVS can be evaluated with reference to a relevant “competing” single use, either solar power generation or agricultural production. For example, SDG indicators that relate to the lives of small-scale farmers are only evaluated with respect to single use agriculture, because in this case the land was previously being used for agricultural purposes. This standard implies that impacts of an AVS are evaluated from the perspective of a pre-existing single use farm or a pre-existing single use, non-utility scale solar array. However, it should be noted an AVS could be directly built onto land that was previously unused, or barren; comparisons of AVS to a “pre-existing” farm or array are simply used to clearly identify the relative strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of an AVS. Finally, this analysis focuses on smallholder farms, which are specifically mentioned in an SDG target and which account for over 40% of the value of food production in LICs/LMICs [39 ]. This analysis evaluates AVS in relation to SDGs, not to markets. We define strengths and weaknesses as direct impacts and threats and opportunities as secondary impacts, expanding the definitions of the four components of SWOT analysis beyond a straightforward contrast of internal and external forces. Strengths and weaknesses are intrinsic to the system and arise once an AVS is installed. In contrast, opportunities and threats require a second step or action by the AVS operator after the system is installed. A farmer may change crop type or purchase new equipment, or the action may involve a third-party, engaging with a government program that provides incentive for AVS, for example. This paper limits analysis of the impacts of AVS to those that have been documented in the literature, or that have been experienced by the authors. Impacts are also drawn from the literature on single use solar and agriculture, e.g., links to education from electrification may contribute to a benefit or harm of moving from an agriculture only scenario to a dual use scenario. Impacts that may be attributed to any  new technology or expansion of any  sector are not considered. For example, though AVS may create new jobs, only direct links between the systems and job creation are mentioned. Finally, this analysis assumes sufficient demand to absorb electricity generation from AVS, or to absorb new crop production. Section 3  uses the SWOT framework to identify the positive and negative impacts of AVS. Section 4  applies the SWOT analysis to Debre Berhan, Ethiopia, and Section 5  discusses the implications of this analysis. Section 6  concludes.  3 Results The following sections summarize the strengths (Section 3.1 ), weaknesses (Section 3.2 ), opportunities (Section 3.3 ), and threats (Section 3.4 ) to the SDGs stemming from AVS, highlighting goals and specific indicators. Fig. 2   offers a high-level summary of the SWOT analysis and which goals belong in each category, relative to each reference case. The calculations for “intensity of impact” can be found in the Supplementary Material (file “summary_table.xlsx”). The intensity of impact of AVS on each SDG is approximated by the number of indicators classified as a strength, weakness, opportunity, or threat within each broader SDG Goal. While a detailed table with individual indicators listed can be found in the Appendix (Table A1 ), Table 1   provides brief justifications for each classification. For the sake of brevity, the shorthand names for each SDG Goal are used within the table and throughout the text. 3.1 Strengths The clearest intrinsic strengths of AVS in the context of SDGs relate to SDGs 2 (Zero Hunger) and 7 (Affordable Clean Energy), given that AVS will always increase agricultural output with respect to a solar array, and will always increase clean electricity generation with respect to single use agriculture. The increase in combined output per land unit can be measured with the land equivalent ratio (LER) [14 ,17 ,43 ]:(1) LER = Y avs  Y ref   + Ge n avs   Ge n ref       where Y avs   and Gen avs   represent the value of agricultural yield and solar generation in an AVS, respectively, and Y ref   and Gen ref   represent the value of agricultural yield and solar generation in a reference single use system, respectively. The greater land equivalent ratio of AVS translates to higher incomes for land owners and operators (i.e., food producers) because revenues from solar panels are typically higher than agricultural revenues [11 ,20 ,22 ,44 ,45 ]. In some cases, yield under an AVS can also increase compared to single use agriculture [46 ], though this is not a guaranteed outcome. Regardless, AVS contributes to achieving indicator 2.3.2, average income of small-scale food producers. An improved LER further relates to indicator 2.4.1, the proportion of agricultural area under productive and sustainable agriculture; the adoption of dual-use techniques on a plot of land previously used solely for agriculture (or solar) makes full use of “negative space” on farms [4 ] and inherently involves increasing productivity. There are also less obvious strengths with respect to single use agriculture. First, AVS can reduce evapotranspiration when compared to single use agriculture by moderating temperatures, relevant to indicator 6.4.1, changing water-use efficiency [47 ]. The panel cover creates a cooling effect in the summer and a warming effect in the winter [43 ], which, when compared to single use agriculture may extend the growing season; researchers have found, for example, that vegetation below AVS has higher late season biomass [44 ]. A longer growing season may in turn contribute to higher agricultural revenues, or higher total agricultural yields throughout the year (indicator 2.3.1, volume of production per labor unit). For crops that already benefit from shading, panels in AVS can make the shading instrument revenue generating, as has been described in the case of matcha [45 ]. Finally, the protective effect extends beyond shading to mitigating extreme weather, like hail [10 ,46 ], which can have severe impacts on harvests. For rainfed agriculture, the impact of droughts may also be mitigated; research suggests that under water stressed conditions grain yields in an AVS are higher than in a single use farm [15 ]. Protection against extreme weather can further bolster the case for AVS increasing food producer incomes, and land productivity. Taken together, increased and diversified incomes for agricultural workers and farmers – which account for the majority of the world's poor [47 ] – can reduce levels of absolute and relative poverty (indicators 1.1.1 and 1.2.1) as well as the income of the bottom 40% of the population (indicator 10.1.1). The final strengths of AVS relative to single use agriculture regard the systems' contribution to a greener, electrified economy as addressed in SDGs 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure). In rural areas with little to no grid access, and little potential for any, AVS can expand access to electricity (7.1.1), which is considered a component of basic services (e.g., hygiene services, clean energy, sanitation), as tracked in indicator 1.4.1. Even where electricity access is common, AVS generate clean, renewable electricity (indicators 7.1.2 and 7.2.1), which can displace higher emitting, conventional generation sources [48 ,49 ], thereby reducing CO2  and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (indicators 9.4.1 and 13.2.2). They also thus increase installed renewable energy capacity (indicators 7.b.1/12.a.1). Strengths with regards to single use solar are concentrated in SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) by virtue of including food production on formerly single use land. The addition of crops to solar arrays can increase access to food, which can have positive impacts on undernourishment (2.1.1), food insecurity (2.1.2), stunting (2.2.1), and malnutrition (2.2.2). In addition, because the water used to wash solar panels can be reused to irrigate crops in an AVS, the systems also improve water-use efficiency with respect to single use solar (6.4.1). Finally, by combining power infrastructure with already developed land, AVS reduces the land footprint of solar [50 ], positively impacting indicators 15.1.1 (forest area), 15.3.1 (land degradation), and 15.5.1 (loss of biodiversity) in areas where solar infrastructure may displace natural habitats.  3.2 Weaknesses Weaknesses are ways in which an AVS will, simply by virtue of implementation, set back achievement of SDGs. Weaknesses are essentially the converse of AVS' strengths; a strength with respect to agriculture (e.g., SDG 7) often becomes a weakness with respect to single use solar, and vice versa. Compared to single use agriculture, AVS may reduce absolute crop yields per land area because of the need to share space with solar panel infrastructure. Planting AVS with incompatible crops (e.g., shade intolerant) can cause decreases in yields [11 ]. Such reductions in yield undermine progress towards several SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) indicators, e.g., undernourishment (2.1.1), food insecurity (2.1.2), stunting (2.2.1), and malnutrition (2.2.2). It may also increase the harvesting effort per unit yield if more efficient harvesting methods cannot be implemented, reducing progress towards more productive agriculture (2.4.1). However, yield reduction is not a given, as pointed out in Section 3.1 ., and harvesting of some crops, particularly those which do not require large harvest machinery, will be relatively unimpacted by the presence of AVS infrastructure. Compared to single use solar farms, AVS generate less electricity per acre, reducing the amount of renewable electricity generated and installed capacity (indicators 7.b.1/12.a.1). This will correspondingly impact the number of households that could receive electricity access (SDG 7, Affordable and Clean Energy, indicators 7.1.1, 7.1.2, and 7.2.1) and emission reduction (indicators 9.4.1 and 13.2.2). A final possible weakness is related to the biggest challenge facing AVS writ large: upfront capital costs, which are often higher than those for single use solar arrays because of the increased costs associated with modifying panel structures to accommodate crops (e.g., raising panels) [51 ]. Though research suggests that over its lifetime an AVS will result in increased landowner incomes, there is no literature on short-term impacts of upfront costs, which may be a weakness in terms of the SDGs. However, increased costs merit noting given that they are one of the primary concerns in installing AVS.  3.3 Opportunities The dual nature of AVS lends itself to initiatives promoting electrification, clean energy, and agricultural production. To that end, there are many possible secondary benefits of AVS that can be harnessed for progress towards the SDGs, as well as external market conditions and global trends that AVS can complement. These opportunities can largely be broken down into agricultural emissions reduction, electrification, and food production/storage, and are with respect to single use agriculture. 3.3.1 Agricultural emissions Reducing CO2  and GHG emissions (indicators 9.4.1 and 13.2.2) and increasing renewable electricity access is one of AVS' primary strengths with respect to single use agriculture, but the impact of AVS on these indicators also depends on how the electricity generated is used. The potential to electrify farm operations specifically offers a significant opportunity because agriculture is a very energy intensive industry; as of 2019, agriculture, forestry, and other land use accounted for 22% of global GHG emissions [52 ]. The Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found that carbon sequestration in agriculture and increasing solar energy supply are among the mitigation avenues with the highest potential contribution to net emission reductions by 2030 [52 ]. Dual-use systems can support both of these avenues and the electricity produced in AVS can power on-farm machinery, irrigation infrastructure, and pesticide delivery systems, reducing the overall carbon footprint of agriculture [53 ]. On-farm electricity production from AVS could further synergize with the development of electric tractors (eTractors). In 2021, emissions from fuel combustion in the United States' agriculture sector accounted for 37.7 million metric tons of CO2 eq, 5.9% of US agricultural emissions [54 ]. eTractors can be expected to reduce these emissions [55 ] while providing the high torque and low speeds that are ideal for agricultural activities such as plowing [56 ,57 ]. Though the potential of reducing emissions with eTractors may be small in regions with limited reliance on farm machinery, eTractors can act as batteries within a distributed energy storage system [58 ]. Such storage is important because solar is a non-dispatchable electricity source; during the night and on cloudy days solar power is not available. In rural areas with limited access to electricity, this can greatly magnify the impact of electrification by enabling phone charging and other uses throughout the night. Additionally, it makes the electricity generated mobile; eTractors can be driven to different homes or facilities for short-term electricity provision. Second, the power provided by AVS opens the door for novel on-farm operations such as solar power-driven electrolysis. Electrolysis can produce both fertilizer for agriculture and ammonia to power fuels cells, which can then provide electricity for both on-farm and transportation use. Studies of on-farm production of fertilizer via photovoltaic energy provide encouraging results. In Indiana, researchers find that solar panels installed on less than 1% of corn fields in Indiana could generate enough electricity to produce fertilizer for the remaining land in the state [59 ]. While this specific research focuses on single use solar, by co-locating agriculture and solar power AVS allows for on-site fertilizer production for farms. In addition to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions during the fertilizer synthetization process, on-site production negates the greenhouse gas emissions associated with transporting the fertilizer. Taken together, the potential of AVS to enable eTractors and solar power-driven electrolysis can increase the proportion of the population primarily relying on clean technology as well as the renewable energy share in total final energy consumption (indicators 7.1.2 and 7.2.1). Production of fertilizer raises a third opportunity: increasing fertilizer use in areas with suboptimal usage (e.g., not subject to eutrophication), which leads to higher agricultural yields and productivity (indicators 2.3.1 and 2.4.1). Fertilizer production raises the prospect of an additional revenue stream for farmers (indicator 2.3.2, smallholder farmer income). The ammonia produced on-site also has the potential to be used as a green energy fuel source for electric tractors [60 ] instead of battery-power. Compared to batteries, ammonia fuel cells reduce the need for mining and its associated impacts for both a single use agriculture and solar reference case (e.g., indicators 15.3.1, degraded land, and 15.5.1, Red List index).  3.3.2 Electrification of nearby facilities In rural areas, AVS not only provide power on a farm, but also for off-farm work and for households nearby, which may be the case for single use solar, but is not for single use agriculture. Off-farm uses for electricity can include lighting, charging stations for cell phones/laptops, and television/radio access [61 ,62 ]. Research suggests that the magnitude of electrification impacts (e.g., healthcare access, education) varies widely with socioeconomic and geographic context and can be both positive and negative [63 ,64 ], though impacts are most often positive or null. Agrivoltaic systems can be paired with initiatives to develop and expand community institutions in rural areas currently lacking sources of electricity [65 ]. Analysis and anecdotal evidence [66 ,67 ] link rural electrification to longer hours for healthcare clinics and improved cold chains (cold storage for vaccines and other medical supplies), resulting in a positive association between electrification and healthcare access [68 ]. This is linked to SDG 3, Good Health and Well-Being, specifically indicator 3.b.3, availability of essential medicines. Schools could benefit from lighting and power for computers and other technologies, increasing access to education, per indicators 4.1.1, 4.1.2, 4.2.2, and 4.6.1 in SDG Goal 4, Quality Education. Electricity is also a component of basic services, which indicator 4.a.1 tracks for schools. Healthcare and educational centers are but two examples of facilities that AVS could help electrify. Maintaining agricultural production with the addition of electricity access can stimulate job growth and the establishment of micro-enterprises. In fact, dual use solar has been linked to the new job opportunities [49 ], contributing to SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) indicators related to employment (8.3.1, 8.5.1, 8.5.2, 8.6.1), relative to both single use agriculture and single use solar. Thriving facilities and economic opportunities tend to attract others: cafés, grocery stores, processing facilities, and more.  3.3.3 Food production and storage Given low cost, on-farm electricity generation, farmers may be able to afford irrigation systems to maintain agricultural production during dry periods or seasons [45 ], compounding beneficial impacts to food security and nutrition (indicators 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, 2.2.2) relative to agriculture. In a case study of villages in Northern Benin, the addition of solar powered irrigation pumps resulted in increased overall produce volume and increased family produce (and overall food) consumption (indicator 2.3.1), largely driven by changes during the dry season [45 ]. Irrigation can also allow for the introduction of higher value, higher yield, or more nutrient dense crop varieties [69 ], further contributing to progress on indicators for SDG 2 (Zero Hunger). In a similar vein, farmers may have the financial and practical resources to expand refrigeration, allowing for longer-term food storage, which can in turn contribute to food security (SDG indicator 2.1.2). Estimates in LICs/LMICs suggest that more than 40% of food losses occur at the post-harvest and processing levels, with lack of refrigeration cited as a major factor [70 ]. Reduction of food waste supports indicator 12.3.1, aiming to lower food loss and waste. A single use agriculture system does not afford these opportunities, and a single use solar array does not maintain the agricultural production to support food security; AVS provide an opportunity relative to both, contingent on installing a refrigeration system.   3.4 Threats In some cases, threats to the SDGs from AVS are tightly linked to weaknesses or opportunities, and the ways that AVS are designed and managed. In other cases, they rely purely on external drivers. One such driver is local knowledge capacity. Because AVS are a relatively recent phenomenon, technical expertise in how to implement the systems is limited. Poorly implemented systems – designed with unsuitable crops or in ways that inhibit harvesting practices – can compound the weaknesses described in Section 3.2 . Relative to single use agriculture, lower yields can lead to local food shortages, which can drive food prices higher (indicator 2.c.1) [71 ]. Especially for poor and disadvantaged communities, higher food prices or on-farm shortages can lead to hunger and its associated impacts (indicators 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, 2.2.2). Lack of market stability is also associated with worker shortages and a lack of workforce capacity over time [72 ], which may impact employment rates (indicator 8.5.2). If a second exogenous driver appears – e.g., energy price increases – this could interact with yield decreases to shift agriculture from the main interest to a secondary concern, further intensifying the aforementioned effects. The secondary impacts of mining, consumption, and disposal of materials necessary for photovoltaic panels pose a second threat, relative to single use agriculture. Solar panels contain cadmium, gallium, germanium, indium, selenium, and tellurium, which are recovered as byproducts from the mining of other metals [73 ]. Conducted irresponsibly, extraction of these minerals can undermine progress towards SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production, indicators 12.2.1 and 12.2.2, material footprint and material consumption), and SDG 15 (Life on Land), due to the links between mining and deforestation (indicators 15.1.1, 15.2.1, 15.4.2), land degradation (indicator 15.3.1), and loss of biodiversity (indicator 15.5.1) [74 ,75 ]. It may also threaten SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth, indicator 8.8.1 - fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries) given the exploitative history of mining [76 ,77 ]. It is important to note that these impacts are threats and not weaknesses because they are determined by the AVS materials supply chain, which is a product of the broader, global economy. In the same vein, the waste generated by AVS, relative to single use agriculture, is a major threat. Given solar panels' 20–30 year lifespan, there is a shortage of capacity to recycle material at large enough scale over the coming decades [78 ,79 ]. Advances in technology, energy demands, and social behavior, which may change greatly over that time period [80 ], will determine the end-of-life treatment for photovoltaic panels in an AVS. If proper disposal or repurposing plans are not made, spent materials could pose a threat to SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) in terms of the amount of hazardous waste generated and treated and national recycling rates (indicators 12.4.2 and 12.5.1) [81 ]. Whether or not these threats materialize into the negative consequences described above greatly relies on the decisions made in the design and management processes. Relative to single use agriculture, AVS may also negatively impact achievement of SDG 5 (Gender Equality). Research suggests that in some regions off-grid electrification can increase the independence of, and number of employment opportunities for, women [61 ,82 ]. However, there may be cases where women are simply adding paid work to unpaid chores and extending their total work load [83 ]. In this sense, as measured by indicator 5.4.1 (hours of unpaid and domestic work by women), the only relevant indicator for SDG 5, off-grid electrification via AVS may unintuitively have a negative impact on SDG 5. A final threat, with regards both to single use solar and single use agriculture, is financial. The capital cost of AVS is very sensitive to scale, and this will give advantage to larger growers at the expense of smaller growers, given that the price per watt of installation is cheaper as the size of the AVS farm is increased [84 ]. With their already high capital costs, AVS could favor agricultural corporations over smallholder farms, which could threaten achievement of SDG indicator 2.3.2 (average income of small-scale food producers) relative to single use agriculture.   4 Application to Debre Birhan, Ethiopia The specific context of an AVS, both institutional and climatic, determines how impacts to the SDGs will manifest. To highlight this, the prospect of installing an AVS in Debre Birhan, Ethiopia is explored. Debre Birhan is a city in the highlands of central Ethiopia, in the Amhara Region (see Fig. 3  ). It is 9320 ft above sea level with a mild climate that includes three seasons: a rainy season (Kiremt) when the majority of crops are produced, a dry season (Bega), and a short-period rainy season (Belg). The city is home to a wool factory, farms, and three colleges: Debre Birhan University, Debre Birhan Polytechnic College, and Debre Birhan Teacher Education College. Agriculture is the primary driver of the local economy. Challenges in the region include rapid urbanization, high levels of poverty and income inequality, lack of formal employment opportunities, poor infrastructure, and limited access to electricity. In addition, the city, which in the last census was recorded as having a population of 146,000 [85 ], has absorbed a several thousand displaced persons due to the civil war between the Ethiopian government and Tigrayan forces [86 ], suddenly increasing the population and stretching available resources. The productivity of the agriculture sector in Debre Birhan is currently very low, constrained by a rain-fed system, traditional farming techniques, and low-uptake of agricultural technologies like fertilizer, herbicides/pesticides, improved seed, and farm machinery. Improvements in agricultural productivity could be valuable tools for poverty reduction and increased food security. In addition, educational opportunities are limited, in part because government schools are required to support themselves and pay for their own water, electricity, supplies, and repairs. The challenges facing Debre Birhan led to the creation of The Community Project: Ethiopia (TCP) (https://communityproject.org/ ), a non-profit which seeks to support primary school education, workforce training, and agricultural innovation on its 4.2 ha government property. In January 2019, TCP established the Wogagen School, a public school which includes classrooms for three levels of kindergarten and first through fourth grades, complemented by classroom gardens for medicinal herbs and vegetables, composting toilets supplying free fertilizer, a 1000 square meter educational farm garden for vegetables, a traditional and a high-density apple orchard, and a bamboo propagation nursery. Next steps for the project include expanding classrooms through middle school and adding a community center for skills training and microbusinesses. The Community Project is also evaluating whether and how to integrate an AVS with the existing educational farm with the goals of 1) creating a new revenue stream for the Wogagen School; and 2) having a reliable source of electricity that can power on-site facilities. In this setting, the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of AVS to local SDG achievement can be considered relative to single use agriculture, the current alternative. Debre Birhan and the Wogagen School provide a welcoming opportunity for AVS: year-round sunlight, a variety of shade loving herbs and vegetables, and an existing land area reserved for agriculture. Use of AVS could have significant impacts on SDGs 1 (No Poverty), 2 (Zero Hunger), 4 (Quality Education), 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), and 15 (Life on Land) – some of which are clear from the analysis throughout the text and others which are more specific to Debre Birhan and elaborated on in the following sections (see Table 2   and Fig. A1  in the Appendix). 4.1 Strengths In this case study, as in most places, AVS' strengths lie in their ability to support agriculture and provide clean energy. Hunger in Ethiopia is a pressing problem; food prices have quadrupled since 2016 [87 ], much agricultural land was lost during the civil war, and thousands of displaced people are coming to the Debre Birhan to find food. Many people have resorted to restricting their diets, eating mostly grains. An AVS in Debre Birhan would reduce heat stress and water requirements for plants, specifically for crops that are already grown during the dry season: carrots, cabbage, salad, beans, peas, wheat, and barley. This could positively impact crop yields if heat and drought are lowering crop yields, and would consistently improve water use efficiency (6.4.1). With regards to clean energy, the African Clean Energy Outlook [88 ] reports that more than 50% of the people in Ethiopia do not have access to electricity and that solid biomass is the primary cooking fuel. Solar power generation via AVS could contribute to greater access to electricity and a cleaner energy mix (indicators 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 7.2.1). The Community Project's AVS is being designed with the intent to electrify nearby facilities, turning several of the opportunities discussed in Section 3.3  into strengths with respect to single use agriculture. First, the AVS will be used to supply electricity to the school, supporting progress towards SDG 4 (Quality Education, indicators 4.1.1, 4.1.2, 4.2.2, 4.6.1, 4.a.1).  Electricity generated will be used to light classrooms – which has been linked to improved student attention and teacher motivation [87 ] – and enable evening skills trainings for micro businesses including sewing, welding, carpentry, and health services. Moreover, by providing a decentralized form of electricity which can power a rural school, AVS contributes to a more accessible educational system, which disproportionately benefits girls who may have been forced to drop out of school to prioritize siblings' education or to avoid leaving the village. Education is also associated with poverty [88 ], meaning that increased accessibility of education will likely positively impact achievement of Goal 1, No Poverty (indicators 1.1.1, 1.2.1). Finally, though in Debre Birhan the focus is relative to a single use agriculture scenario, it is also important to note that compared to single use solar, AVS provides a platform for teaching students about agriculture and the role of technology in the sector – a major advantage for an agriculturally dominated region, and in line with indicator 4.4.1 related to the proportion of adults with information and communications technology skills. The plans for the AVS also involve addressing critical irrigation needs. Currently, the farm is rainfed or irrigated manually. Though the property is connected to the city's potable water system, it is both more expensive than untreated river water and unreliable, as city power supplies are subject to blackouts which impede pumping of water. An AVS can be used to power TCP's irrigation system, which is currently defunct because of lack of electricity, while shading from the solar panels could simultaneously reduce water usage per crop (6.4.1) [6 ]. Benefits could be extensive; research localized in Debre Birhan suggests that irrigation can increase total income up to sixfold depending on the crop grown [89 ]. For the educational farm, irrigation would mean the ability to cultivate year-round crops to include a larger variety of high value crops such as fruit and vegetables, which enable the school to increase its income, land productivity (2.4.1), and community impact with regards to hunger-related indicators (2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, 2.2.2). Apples trees are particularly sought after in the region because of their ongoing productivity and high nutritional and economic value. Seedlings can be planted between or below the rows of panels, creating a business with the intent to sell saplings at a size suitable for planting in the community and before interfering with the panels. Given proper design, the solar panels may offer shelter from heat stress as well as a wind break (as has occurred by happenstance in an experimental AVS plot [47 ]), which is necessary in Debre Birhan, where the wind poses a strong threat to crops. The Wogagen School already trains farmers at their demonstration apple orchards to encourage sales of seedling trees, and AVS could facilitate that activity.  4.2 Weaknesses Relative to single use agriculture, the primary weakness of AVS in Debre Birhan is the additional waste produced, namely with regards to batteries. Batteries have lifespans ranging between 5 and 15 years [90 ], but in the experience of TCP, their useful lifetimes can be as short as 2 years depending on the manufacturer. In such cases, batteries not only represent a waste problem relative to single use agriculture (indicators 8.4.1/8.4.2 regarding material consumption, and 12.4.2 regarding hazardous waste), but also a large, ongoing cost once the AVS is installed.  4.3 Opportunities At a higher level, AVS can complement ongoing national initiatives. First, AVS can be a source of employment (SDG 8, Decent Work and Economic Growth) for individuals across relevant supply chains (e.g., agriculture, solar). With reference to single use agriculture, AVS could be paired with skills training initiatives, especially with regards to panel installation and maintenance. This may benefit indicator 8.5.1, average hourly earnings, given that salaries for solar installers and technicians tend to be higher than farmer salaries [91 ]. Installing an AVS may further have spillover employment effects as local businesses expand operation [87 ]. There are currently training programs for solar technicians at the Debre Birhan Polytechnic College, and organizations like Barefoot College have developed programs to train individuals from rural areas in solar maintenance [92 ]. Compared to single use solar, AVS also maintains agricultural employment, which in Ethiopia accounts for 75% of the workforce [93 ], along with complementary industries, such as agricultural equipment production and supply. This may be important in reducing unemployment (indicator 8.5.2). Finally, there is an opportunity to use AVS to support SDG 15 (Life on Land) by planting trees below the panels. Though TCP is currently planning to pair their AVS with apple trees, native trees can also be grown with the eventual goal of reforesting (or afforesting) outlying areas. Such plans can increase the proportion of forest area (indicator 15.1.1) and contribute to the restoration of previously degraded land (indicator 15.3.1).  4.4 Threats There are no direct threats that AVS specifically pose to SDG achievement in Debre Birhan. However, there are threats to AVS technology uptake that may impact incomes for small-scale farmers relative to single use agriculture. For the Wogagen School, and likely many facilities interested in AVS, the major hurdle to installing the systems is financing. The Ethiopian government lacks the resources to finance such projects, especially in light of the last three years of conflict. In addition, AVS in Debre Birhan would be undertaken with no clear return for private investors; crops are typically sold at low prices, and there is limited immediate financial return to expanding school hours or hosting skills training workshops. Another concern is land ownership. Like single use solar systems, AVS require semi-permanent solar panel installations (20–30 years). Yet, in Ethiopia land is state-owned [94 ], which may raise concerns about the long-term viability of infrastructure investments when compared to shorter term agricultural plans. Especially for smallholder farmers, a sudden and unremunerated removal of land can eliminate the prospect of increased income (indicator 2.3.2) and leave them with the debt associated with the AVS without the income. Though this may be unlikely, concerns around long-term infrastructure can inhibit the desirability of an AVS relative to a single use farm.  4.5 Policy implications For multiple reasons, AVS are an attractive prospect for Debre Birhan and TCP. But they are also a synergistic prospect at the national level for the Government of Ethiopia. The Ethiopian government established the National Electrification Program in 2017, targeting 100% electrification in 2025, with 35% of households off-grid, and it has also been addressing the productivity of agriculture [95 ]. As of 2020, Ethiopia was far short of its goal, with a 51% electrification rate [96 ]. Promotion of AVS is a natural companion to the electrification goal and can contribute to increasing the number of off-grid households. A second campaign is the Green Legacy Initiative, with the intent of ‘greening Ethiopia’. In the context of TCP, AVS could contribute substantially, providing shelter and shade to young trees that could then be planted throughout rural areas. Given these synergies, the Ethiopian government could commit funds to subsidizing AVS, which would alleviate the cost burden AVS impose on small-scale farmers.   5 Discussion and recommendations Overall, the extent to which AVS tangibly influence SDG indicators is highly dependent on design decisions, management practices, and additional investment. The co-benefits to agriculture are a function of the crop chosen (see [27 ] for a review of physiological impacts) and the panel layout, which can be energy or agriculture centric [97 ]. Increased customization of an AVS to a specific geography and context can thus magnify the strengths laid out. Alternatively, poorly designed systems can convert strengths into weaknesses or threats. For example, AVS can improve solar panel efficiency by moderating temperatures below the panels [46 ], but they can also reduce efficiency when farm equipment results in greater dust deposition on the panels [3 ,98 ]. And, though this SWOT analysis focused on AVS pairing crop cultivation with solar, many of the impacts could be extended to systems that are not crop-based, i.e., rangevoltaics (solar arrays with livestock grazing below) or to solar arrays co-located with pollinator habitat, which may be more suited to some locations than AVS with crops. Other research highlights the ways in which AVS might impact achievement of the SDGs, although without identifying specific indicators. For example, a lifecycle analysis and environmental impact assessment for the Agrovoltaico  AVS designed by REM TEC S.r.l. in the Po Valley of Italy identified decreased emissions and pollutants (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus) stemming from the construction materials [41 ]. Based on this assessment, and comparison to alternative energy sources, the authors noted that AVS can positively impact 14 of the 17 SDGs. However, while some of these positive impacts are linked to the primary, quantitative analysis (e.g., reduced emissions), others are comments without a direct mechanism linking the goals to AVS, and none identify the impacts on specific metrics. Furthermore, the authors do not discuss how these impacts might differ in other settings, and especially in the LICs/LMICs furthest from achieving the SDGs. Other work directly addresses more SDGs [10 ], but the authors limit their scope to ecosystem services and similarly does not identify individual indicators. This leads to “alignments” between the AVS and 15 of the 17 SDGs, including the four that we have excluded from our analysis because we found no clear link between AVS and the ways that achievement of the goals is measured by each indicator (11, Sustainable Cities and Communities; 14, Life Below Water; 16, Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; and 17, Partnerships for the Goals). In contrast, we find associations between the two goals that are excluded, 4 (Quality Education) and 5 (Gender Equality). Finally, neither study directly compares the impacts to the SDGs relative to counterfactual scenarios, e.g., single use agriculture and single use solar, though [10 ] discuss the benefits of AVS with regards to the agriculture and solar sectors. The endless potential AVS designs highlight that the specific strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats are the result of case-specific interaction effects between many variables, as can be seen in the case of Debre Birhan. For example, in Debre Birhan, one of the major strengths of AVS is that it enables achievement of several education-related indicators (SDG 4). This is, however, only because the AVS is planned to power both the existing schoolhouse and the proposed community center. In most contexts, there is no pre-existing link to an educational facility, making any impacts to SDG 4 (Quality Education) an opportunity at best. On the other hand, the threat of increased material waste materializes and is categorized as a weakness; there are no clear pipelines for solar panel or battery disposal in Debre Birhan as of the paper writing. The climate and topography of the region also make certain aspects of AVS more or less attractive than in other contexts, even if the indicators impacted are the same. Specifically, a major concern for crops is wind. As such, in Debre Birhan a priority in designing an AVS will be shielding crops from wind. In hotter, less windy climates, the priority might be maximizing shade coverage for crops. While in either case AVS can improve crop yields, the mechanisms differ. Finally, the individual crop grown within the AVS will determine whether crop yield will be improved or diminished, and therefore whether impacts to SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) will be strengths or weaknesses. Regardless of the design or crop, there are some important external drivers that will determine the scale of AVS' impact. First is small-scale farmers' access capital. Solar panels of any type require large capital outlays, and AVS are typically more expensive than single use solar arrays because of the modifications needed to accommodate crops. This obstacle for AVS – driven by market prices of panel materials – can be mitigated by national or subnational policies such as microgrants, loans, tax credits, rebates, which would likely also encourage AVS uptake [99 ]. Governments may choose to pair subsidies for AVS with existing or planned electrification schemes, given AVS' potential for creating microgrids in rural regions that may otherwise be too expensive to connect to the grid. A related driver is improvements in solar technology and falling costs. Ongoing research is exploring designs for semi- or fully transparent panels that allow more wavelengths of light to pass through them [100 ,101 ]. Panels could be customized based on the wavelengths of light that are best suited for the agricultural versus solar components of AVS [25 ]. This would improve yields below panels in an AVS or even allow for cultivation of shade intolerant crops – something that may encourage more farmers to convert their fields to AVS. In addition, falling costs of solar can make AVS more financially feasible. As of now, AVS tend to increase costs relative to solar arrays because the panels are typically elevated more than a traditional solar array [11 ], even if the costs of land grading and preparation are reduced [3 ]. Were costs of panels lower, adding them to a farm may be more financially attractive than converting land to a single use solar array. For LICs/LMICs, where access to capital may already be a challenge for straightforward solar arrays [37 ], this is a substantial concern and may discourage AVS adoption. Attention to changing costs is important because, as was noted during a solar energy pilot project in Honduras [102 ], there is an “inherent conflict” between supplying solar technology with the intent for it to be financially self-sustaining, and targeting poor and remote communities that have the least ability to pay for such systems long term and to exploit all of their possible benefits (e.g., additional employment). In the pilot project, micro-enterprises and employment never materialized, in part because of a lack of connection with external markets, and poor physical infrastructure for leaving the village. These challenges have been documented in other cases as well [103 ] and exist in Debre Birhan. Grants may bridge the upfront capital costs of AVS, but there are long-term maintenance and operational costs that must also be accounted for, and AVS will be most beneficial when they are but one component in broader infrastructure development. A third external driver is the ability of local experts to inform crop and design choices. For the purposes of this paper, AVS is described as presenting a strength for achieving SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), especially because it favorably impacts crops relative to single use solar. It will most likely change the distribution of crop types in an area though, as occurred in most AVS in Japan [104 ]. As such, a new AVS could either reduce crop diversity and thus agricultural sustainability (relevant to 2.4.1) or increase agricultural diversity if the microclimate benefits permit growing a wider range of crops. This in turn could improve the financial sustainability of small-scale agriculture [105 ] if crop choices shift to more sensitive, or higher risk, crops that provide higher nutritional and/or financial value. Solar panels can also protect crops from damaging events like hail [106 ] and reduce the impact of frosts on such crops. However, as pointed out in Section 3.4 , local knowledge capacity is critical to ensuring that AVS are implemented in a way that maximizes benefits for farmers and the broader community while reducing impacts to yields. Non-profits and governments alike can serve to manage this threat, while taking advantage of an opportunity by establishing training programs. These programs can serve to improve AVS success and create high-skilled jobs. A final driver is the level of integration of AVS in existing development projects and within a community. When paired with existing development projects, AVS could magnify their impacts, as it is hoped the AVS will do in TCP's project in Debre Birhan. In one case, Abellon Clean Energy established a 3 MW AVS project in India and complemented it with initiatives to encourage micro-enterprise, women empowerment, and knowledge sharing programs, in addition to deliberately employing women [107 ]. Though this analysis classified AVS as posing a threat to the achievement of SDG 5 (Gender Equality), the Abellon project highlights a way to encourage progress in gender equality with AVS. More broadly, AVS' impacts will depend on the effectiveness of community engagement and buy-in, which are critical to a project's long-term success [108 ]. For example, since AVS include high value solar panels, they may be the target of theft [62 ,109 ]. Yet community participation and cooperation can help to protect the security of the system. On a smaller scale, individual buy-in is also important; the dual nature of AVS means that a farmer can pose a danger to solar panels (e.g., damaging them while using equipment), and solar maintenance may threaten crops (e.g., trampling crops). Successful systems require trust between farmers, their communities, and solar developers and technicians. There will likely be macroeconomic and institutional consequences from installing more AVS that reach beyond this analysis. For example, given AVS' capital cost, they may be financed with loans, which would require individuals to open bank accounts (indicator 8.10.1) [62 ]. And, while this analysis limited impacts to those specified within indicators and thus finds strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats relative only to 13 SDGs, AVS address the spirit of most of the SDG goals [10 ,41 ]. In fact, the quantifiable impacts of AVS are dependent on the data indicators rely on. Progress towards Gender Equality illustrates this tension: though AVS may lead to greater employment opportunities for women and greater numbers of girls attending school, indicators for Gender Equality (SDG 5) do not capture these benefits because they focus on unpaid  labor (indicator 5.4.1). One implication may thus be that progress towards each SDG might consider alternative measures for progress, such as including unemployment rate by sex as an indicator within Goal 5. In a similar way, Goal 17 evaluates technical assistance to developing countries (indicator 17.9.1). This paper represents a collaboration between researchers in the Global North (United States) and Global South (Ethiopia), but because it does not have a dollar value, Goal 17 was omitted from the analysis. And yet, it is a form of knowledge exchange and hopeful future technical assistance, based on AVS. An alternative indicator in this case may measure the number of grants or papers involving researchers from different regions of the world.  6 Conclusion Implementing reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure enables economic development and human well-being. Electricity generation and transmission infrastructure, which demands high investment, is also one of the key preconditions to meeting the majority of SDGs. Agrivoltaic systems can thus play a significant role in achieving the SDGs. To fulfill that role, however, researchers, farmers, development assistance programs, and international organizations must think deeply about the structure of AVS, who benefits, and how to capitalize on AVS' positive impacts while minimizing possible negative impacts. Our analysis evaluates both the indirect and direct consequences of AVS for the SDGs. It provides a framework for assessing how AVS can contribute to the achieving the Goals, while noting the negative consequences. For policymakers, private sector actors, and community leaders alike, such an analysis is a critical need as we approach 2030.

Appendix A Appendix This paper discussed the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of AVS in the context of achieving the SDGs, relative to alternative scenarios where land is used only as a solar array or only for agriculture. There are clear links between AVS (or solar and agriculture individually) and all but four SDGs (11, Sustainable Cities and Communities; 14, Life Below Water; 16, Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; 17, Partnerships for the Goals). Table S1 summarizes the indicators identified in this work along with their categorizations (i.e., strength, weakness, opportunity, or threat). Inclusion and categorization are based on impacts documented in the literature. It is important to note that impacts are also considered even if they have only been documented in the context of agriculture or solar, and not directly in AVS. In these cases, evidence is used to suggest impacts when adding solar (i.e., moving from single use agriculture to an AVS) or adding agriculture (i.e., moving from single use solar to AVS) to land.Table A1 Summary of indicators evaluated in SWOT analysis. Strengths or weaknesses that may be magnified based on further action (i.e., that are also discussed in opportunities and threats sections) are listed once in the strengths or weaknesses categories. Indicators were identified through a literature review, and categorizations may change over time and in different contexts.

Categorizations mentioned in Section 4  (Application to Debre Birhan) are summarized in Fig. A1 , which is designed in a similar style to Fig. 2  in the text.Fig. A1 Summary of positive and negative impacts of AVS on the SDGs discussed in the context of Debre Birhan. Arrows show a weighting of the intensity of impact, based on the number of indicators within a goal that are impacted. Indicators discussed in the text with respect to Debre Birhan are not exhaustive, but reflect those that The Community Project is prioritizing, or those that have different categorizations than described in a general context.
