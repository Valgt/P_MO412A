                  As part of a package of measures to alleviate pressures on our planetary boundaries, the European Union farm-to-fork strategy adopts target 12.3 of the sustainable development goals, with the aim of halving food waste by 2030. A quantification of medium-term changes in food loss and waste (FLW) by both food supply chain stage and member state, as well as the cradle-to-grave market impacts from proposed reductions, requires a suitably tailored simulation model. A systems wide approach (MAGNET) with a novel characterisation of FLW behaviour is employed and linked to recent detailed Eurostat FLW estimates. In addition to business-as-usual baseline estimates of FLW to 2030, a scenario assesses the sustainability and circularity impacts from halving food waste via waste behaviour taxes. From 2020 to 2030, baseline EU average per capita FLW grows less than anticipated due to changing household consumption patterns in the newer EU member states. Similarly, by 2030 the share of food losses in total FLW appears to grow. Compared with the baseline in 2030, halving household food waste reduces EU FLW by 17.5 million tonnes. Despite the introduction of targeted food waste behaviour taxes, the average relative EU food price still falls by 2 %. In addition, lower levels of EU emissions- and land leakage are reported, whilst the reduction in bio-waste streams for fertiliser does not incur higher fossil fertiliser uptake due to falling EU crop production. Concluding, the rising projected share of food losses in the baseline signals a need for reinforced stakeholder communication and coordination strategies which are receiving less attention than consumer behaviour, hindering efficient responses to mitigate FLW. Finally, to increase the social acceptance of waste behaviour taxes and mitigate anticipated losses to EU farmers, a policy of channelling tax proceeds to supporting incomes and employment retraining schemes should be publicly visible.

Editor: Prof. Idiano D'Adamo As part of a package of measures to alleviate pressures on our planetary boundaries, the European Union farm-to-fork strategy adopts target 12.3 of the sustainable development goals, with the aim of halving food waste by 2030. A quantification of medium-term changes in food loss and waste (FLW) by both food supply chain stage and member state, as well as the cradle-to-grave market impacts from proposed reductions, requires a suitably tailored simulation model. A systems wide approach (MAGNET) with a novel characterisation of FLW behaviour is employed and linked to recent detailed Eurostat FLW estimates. In addition to business-as-usual baseline estimates of FLW to 2030, a scenario assesses the sustainability and circularity impacts from halving food waste via waste behaviour taxes. From 2020 to 2030, baseline EU average per capita FLW grows less than anticipated due to changing household consumption patterns in the newer EU member states. Similarly, by 2030 the share of food losses in total FLW appears to grow. Compared with the baseline in 2030, halving household food waste reduces EU FLW by 17.5 million tonnes. Despite the introduction of targeted food waste behaviour taxes, the average relative EU food price still falls by 2 %. In addition, lower levels of EU emissions- and land leakage are reported, whilst the reduction in bio-waste streams for fertiliser does not incur higher fossil fertiliser uptake due to falling EU crop production. Concluding, the rising projected share of food losses in the baseline signals a need for reinforced stakeholder communication and coordination strategies which are receiving less attention than consumer behaviour, hindering efficient responses to mitigate FLW. Finally, to increase the social acceptance of waste behaviour taxes and mitigate anticipated losses to EU farmers, a policy of channelling tax proceeds to supporting incomes and employment retraining schemes should be publicly visible.

A roadmap for sustainable progress is laid out under the auspices of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030. The food system will play a key role in this transformation. It is faced with the challenge of feeding approximately half a billion undernourished people, whilst improving the diets of 1.9 billion overweight individuals (WHO, 2021 ). At the same time, however, the food system accounts for up to 30 % of greenhouse gas emissions and accelerates biodiversity losses (EC, 2020a ), whilst it is estimated that up to 40 % of food grown is wasted or lost (WWF, 2021 ). In response, target 12.3 of the SDGs sets a global ambition for halving food waste (from household food demands) and reducing food losses (supply side inefficiencies) by 2030. In the EU, the Farm to Fork (F2F) Strategy (EC, 2020b ) sets out a plan for a more sustainably responsible food system. Taking a holistic view of the food chain, the F2F strategy proposes to reduce by 50 % the use of chemical pesticides; protect biodiversity through a 20 % reduction in chemical fertilisers and a 50 % reduction in nutrient losses, and limit antimicrobial resistance by reducing antimicrobial sales by 50 % in livestock and aquaculture. In terms of land management, there is an aspirational target to assign 25 % of all farmlands to organic farming techniques. The F2F strategy also embeds SDG target 12.3 for ensuring that ‘greener’ and potentially lower yielding agri-food production is not accompanied by market tensions, principally in the form of higher food prices and greater dependence on third country imports. In addition, within the EC's Circular Economy Action Plan (EC, 2020c ), there are proposals to upscale the efficient management, treatment and reuse of bio-waste streams with a view to reducing overdependence on limited natural resources and achieving net zero emissions by 2050. Quantitative simulation models are needed to understand the market synergies and trade-offs associated with food loss and waste (FLW) reductions. On the supply side, there are direct- (actors at different leverage points along the food supply chain) and indirect- (upstream labour, land, fertiliser and feed use) price and quantity effects. Moreover, there are anticipated reductions in food prices, medium-term behavioural adjustments in consumption patterns and the EU's trade autonomy. Household savings that accompany food waste reductions may be re-spent elsewhere, either on the same food products (direct effect) or other goods/services (indirect effect). This ‘rebound effect’ reduces land- and emissions leakage savings (Albizzati et al., 2022 ; Hegwood et al., 2023 ). Further ‘downstream' a reduction in FLW is also expected to have circularity repercussions, in terms of waste collection and treatment. With its systems-wide coverage of economic activity and trade links, a suitable framework for internalising these diverse impacts is an economy-wide multi-region computable general equilibrium (CGE) market simulation model. Combining novel modelling innovations (first and foremost, ‘rational’ waste behaviour) with recent official Eurostat statistics, a primary aim of this paper is to provide plausible medium-term projections of FLW at each stage of the food supply chain for each of the EU member states. As a further aim, a policy scenario examines the use of a novel ‘waste behaviour’ tax to achieve the F2F strategy target of halving household food waste in the EU. The market and non-market impacts are measured employing economic-, social-, environmental- and circularity indicators, and in the context of the F2F and circular economy action plan strategies, assess some of the policy implications.  2 Literature review A key conceptual obstacle relates to the establishment of an accepted definition and measurement of FLW. On the former point, Hoehn et al. (2023)  state that, “there does not seem to exist a consensus or at least a universally accepted definition of what FLW is ” (pp2). This, in turn, has hampered data construction efforts for monitoring and modelling. In defining waste, Cattaneo et al. (2021)  observe that studies are plagued by a lack of conceptual clarity. They note that an interpretation of FLW is obfuscated by stakeholder perspectives. For example, ‘food security’ driven definitions define discarded food from human consumption as lost or wasted (OECD, 2013 ; HLPE, 2014 ), whilst a ‘circular economy’ driven definition (Bellemare et al., 2017 ) does not consider food as lost, if it is finally used as (inter alia) animal feed or composted bio-fertiliser. Moreover, Fabi et al. (2021)  note that different cultural perceptions of food quality biases opinion on the status of food that society considers as ‘fit for consumption'. Examining FLW measurement, there is no universally approved method. Hoehn et al. (2023)  observe that in the absence of a standardised quantification procedure, examples in the literature claim that the size of the problem is both overstated (Bellemare et al., 2017 ) and understated (UNEP, 2021 ). In the context of the EU, De Laurentiis et al. (2021)  provide an overview (with examples) of different accounting approaches to the measurement of commodity specific FLW rates (Fig. 1  ). Approach A combines food production statistics (FAO food balance sheets) with estimates of food waste coefficients at leverage points along the food chain. Approach B ascertains waste rates directly from secondary data on total waste reported by member states following the European Waste Classification (EWC-stat). To separate estimates of food waste from these waste streams, case studies of reliable relevant member state data are used. Finally, approach C follows the FLW definition and accounting estimates of FUSIONS (2016) . An EU aggregate measure of losses and waste is calculated based on normalised conversion factors (i.e., consumption per capita, consumption per unit of production). More recently, a monitoring framework database for FLW has been set up (Eurostat, 2023a ) under the auspices of the EC's Waste Framework Directive (EC, 2018 ), which requires a periodical reporting obligation by member states. This database, covering the years 2020 and 2021, represents the EC's official record of FLW in the EU and forms the data source of the current study (see Section 3 ). The data classifies FLW generation at the EC statistical classification of economic activities (NACE), whilst FLW (aggregating edible and inedible waste) is recorded in tonnes of fresh mass equivalent to ensure compatibility between member states. The methodology borrows from a range of measurement techniques (EC, 2019 ) including (but not restricted to) direct measurement (volumetric weighting), samples of physical separation of food waste from other waste to determine the mass, food dairies, and estimated waste coefficients. In terms of impact assessment, a small number of economy wide CGE impact assessments of FLW reductions, have emerged over the last ten years. Example studies (e.g., Rutten et al., 2013 ; Rutten and Kavallari, 2016 ) borrow secondary data estimates of food waste rates by commodity and supply chain stage (FAO, 2011 ), as a basis to target relevant FLW-saving intermediate and final demand reductions by producers and households, respectively. A more recent example (Kuiper and Cui, 2021 ) advances further by employing improved global FAO FLW rate estimates (FAO, 2019 ) by activities along the supply chain throughout the world, to estimate with more precision the contribution of each supply chain stage toward reducing FLW. Employing economy-wide social accounting matrix multipliers, Lekavicius et al. (2023)  perform a similar set of supply-chain segment experiments for the EU-27. Where reported, the general consensus is that FLW reductions lower food prices, improve food security and reduce emissions, whilst negatively impacting food production and agricultural employment. A common omission in the literature, is they do not capture adjustment costs. For example, modelling supply-driven food loss reductions through productivity improvements reduces the input requirement per unit of output (i.e., improved harvesting methods, packaging, labelling storage, transport etc.), but simultaneously ignores the issue of who pays the associated implementation costs (i.e., it is costless to the producer). Similarly, household taste shifters based on the heroic assumption of ‘moral suasion' are traditionally used to target specific waste reductions. Again, this approach captures market benefits (i.e., savings in expenditure, falling food prices), but it abstracts from the potential ‘direct cost’ imposed on consumers to adhere to this behavioural adjustment (e.g., market driven penalties on wasteful behaviour) or the ‘indirect costs' of additional time and effort (e.g., more trips to the supermarket, fewer ‘multi-buy’ deals, more preparation time and planning). In response, two additional FLW CGE modelling studies emerged. Britz et al. (2014)  explore the ‘labour-leisure’ trade-off associated with increased planning and preparation time. When internalising the time cost, they report substantial changes on production and prices. On the supply side, Philippidis et al. (2019)  model per unit ‘compliance costs’ (e.g., labelling, packaging) in the EU as a fixed percentage of the sales value of each food commodity ‘c’. Including said producer borne costs, the authors report relatively smaller EU food price falls and notably more pessimistic estimates of agricultural employment losses. In both cases, due to a lack of empirical certainty, there is a heavy reliance on ad hoc behavioural assumptions. Two further methodological knowledge gaps are also observable from the modelling literature, which this paper seeks to fill. Firstly, there is no explicit endogenous characterisation of rational ‘wasteful behaviour’. The current study incorporates rational FLW behaviour within the intermediate and final demand functions linked with official Eurostat member state estimates of real quantity FLW flows at different stages along the supply chain to end uses. Internalising these novel behavioural elements, a key hypothesis is whether EU FLW will continue to rise at the same rate with expected increases in EU GDP and population, as we move toward 2030. Secondly, there has been no attempt to internalise the entire FLW cycle from cradle to grave. The current study examines the repercussions on the resulting FLW streams, their collection costs and treatment for circular uses (i.e., feed, energy, material applications). As an additional innovation, socially responsible food consumption is more realistically motivated through the taxation of wasteful behaviour, thereby internalising the behavioural adjustment costs to society associated with this attitudinal shift. With previous studies showing unambiguous food price falls under FLW reductions, a further testable hypothesis in the current study is to examine whether food prices are still expected to fall in the presence of a targeted waste behaviour tax.  3 Materials and methods Section 3.1  presents the CGE database and model. Section 3.2  discusses the tracing of waste flows within the model, the representation of theoretically consistent waste behaviour and the reconciliation of the Eurostat waste data with the MAGNET model. Finally, Section 3.3  describes the activity and regional aggregation, the baseline, and the scenario design. For the general reader, an introductory description of CGE modelling and data is provided in Section S2 of the Supplementary materials documentation. Woltjer and Kuiper (2014)  provide documentation on the MAGNET model. 3.1 Database and model The Modular Applied General Equilibrium Tool (MAGNET) (Woltjer and Kuiper, 2014 ) belongs to the neoclassical family of multi-regional macroeconomic CGE simulation models. The core of MAGNET is the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model (Corong et al., 2017 ) and accompanying database (Aguiar et al., 2019 ). Version 10 of the GTAP data follows the principles of a social accounting matrix (SAM) covering 65 activities and 141 regions complete with primary factor, intermediate input and final demand value transactions measured at basic, producer and purchaser's prices. Macroeconomic accounts are linked via gross bilateral commodity specific trade flows that include taxes, subsidies and transport margins to yield ‘cost-insurance-freight’ and ‘free-on-board’ prices, whilst the capital account of the balance of payments, records intra-regional investment and savings. In a typical neoclassical CGE model (see Fig. 2  ), ‘rational’ intermediate-, final- and investment demand behaviour is based on the theoretical tenets of constrained optimisation, compartmentalised into ‘nests’. In CGE modelling, a ‘nest’ characterises purchase trade-offs in response to the changing relative prices of different alternatives, where the strength of the purchase switch is governed by an elasticity of substitution parameter. The nests are structured into successive purchase stages or ‘decision-trees’. To enforce the equilibrium conditions of the underlying data, market clearing equations set supply equal to demand, whilst further accounting equations ensure that zero long economic profits prevail (consistent with constant returns to scale technologies), macroeconomic output, expenditure and income are equal and that the balance of payments summed over the current- (exports minus imports) and capital account (regional savings less regional investment), nets to zero. To solve a system of ‘N’ equations requires a model ‘closure’ of ‘N’ endogenous variables (i.e., variables determined by the model solution) and ‘M’ exogenous variables (i.e., variables inputted externally by the modeller). Subsequent hypothetical changes or ‘shocks' in exogenous variables (e.g., sector-wide productivities, tax rates), give rise to a new matrix of market clearing equilibrium prices and quantities at the counterfactual general equilibrium point. To internalise a more comprehensive definition of the resource boundaries and economic constraints within which the food system operates, the SAM data for MAGNET advances on that of the GTAP data. Further commodity and activity splits from the existing GTAP activities/commodities accounts are introduced with a largely bio-based market focus (e.g., additional agricultural, bio-energy, bio-based materials, fertilisers and feeds commodities and activities – see Section S3 of the Supplementary materials). In the agriculture activities, MAGNET also captures specific input-nest technology combinations for crop (i.e., fertiliser vs land) and livestock (i.e., substitutability between animal feed types) production; land, labour and capital factor rigidities, sustainable limits on available land and agricultural and forestry residue supplies.  3.2 MAGNET waste modelling 3.2.1 Modelling the waste flows in MAGNET Fig. 3   traces the transaction flows for the processing, treatment and circularity of FLW in the model database. In the top rows, producers at various stages and households generate food waste at five different leverage points of the supply chain. Following the equilibrium conditions of the model, all food waste can be collected as an input into either green or ‘grey’ (rest) waste activities. The ‘supply’ of collected green waste is equal to the demand by the compost treatment activity, which in turn is demanded for use in bio-based fertiliser or energy applications. In the base year, most compost will be used as a biofertilizer (on average about 95 % of the compost), however following Chia et al. (2020)  the option of using compost as an input for bioenergy sectors or as bioelectricity has been added. Similarly, the supply of ‘rest’ waste is equal to landfill and incineration demands, the latter of which can be used in bio-heat and electricity activities.  3.2.2 Waste generating behaviour in MAGNET To link FLW generation with consumer and producer behaviour, it is modelled as a domestic margin commodity. This means that if food commodities are consumed or used as inputs, a waste margin will be automatically generated. In this way, consumers and producers demand a ‘composite’ bundle of the original food commodity and its associated waste collection services. To illustrate the modelling for final (i.e., household) demands, the relevant modified part of the household demand nesting structure including waste margins is shown in Fig. 4  . The modified nest structure is generic (i.e., across all commodities ‘c’), although waste margins only correspond to the subset of food related commodities. To aid the understanding of the figure, the orange, green and grey colour shades in Fig. 4  match the relevant coloured flows identified in Fig. 3 . Private household homothetic constant elasticity of substitution (CES) demand for a given commodity ‘c’ in region ‘r’ (qpa), is split between commodity ‘c’ of imported (qpma) and domestic (qpda) origin. At the next level of the nest, domestic and import demands are subdivided between the ‘non-wasted’ part of commodity ‘c’ (i.e., qpd and qpm), and the corresponding demand for waste collection services on commodity ‘c’ (i.e., qrpd and qrpm) (highlighted in orange). Typically, an inelastic CES substitution elasticity is chosen to capture the notion that the purchase of a commodity ‘c’ is largely accompanied by a similar proportional change in the level of waste that it generates. At the lowest nest, is the demand for waste collection services by type, ‘w’. Food waste can be either collected as green waste (w1) or as grey waste (w2) from commodity ‘c’. It is assumed that the total cost shares for these waste collection services, remain constant over time (Cobb-Douglas demand function). The representation of industry demands including food loss generation is analogous to the consumption structure above and is described in Section S3 of the Supplementary materials document. In functioning markets with rational decision making, food waste (in affluent societies) reflects convenient lifestyle choices, whilst food losses are an outcome of cost-efficient production processes. As noted in the introduction, a movement away from these optimum points therefore represents a cost. In this study, these behavioural cost adjustments are internalised as a per unit behavioural tax on loss (producers) or waste (household) generating intermediate or final demands. This modelling interpretation is motivated by previous policy induced Pigouvian market interventions designed to incentivise more sustainable food choices such as ‘fat-taxes’ in Denmark, or ‘sugar-taxes’ introduced in the UK (Pell et al., 2021 ). Using Fig. 4  to illustrate, in the model code a price linkage equation is inserted with a waste tax separating the pre- and post-waste behaviour tax unit cost on private household domestic (qrpd) and imported (qrpm) waste generation demands. The same approach is used in the production nest. These (exogenous) waste tax variables are employed to raise the cost of wasteful behaviour on purchases of commodity ‘c’, thereby incentivising reductions in food loss and waste generation (see also Section 3.3 ).  3.2.3 FLW database in MAGNET The structure of the EU FLW data flows represented as percentage shares by different leverage points along the supply chain (Fig. 5  ), is supported using official FLW quantity estimates from Eurostat (2023a) . To summarise, the largest share of EU FLW (64 %) is generated by households (far right column, Fig. 6  ). At the EU level, post-harvest losses, food processing and retail and distribution losses account for 11 %, 18 % and 7 % of total FLW, respectively. There is, however, variation across member states, where for example Bulgaria, Denmark, Netherlands and Spain exhibit a majority of FLW corresponding to the stages of industrial food production. Further consideration of this data is given in Sections 4 and 5 .   3.3 Aggregation, baseline and scenario design To maintain the FLW focus of the study whilst limiting the computational burden of the model, necessitates a careful selection of commodities and regions. A disaggregation of 80 commodities is chosen to capture agri-food activities along the supply chain (crops, livestock, food processing, food services and trade services), relevant inputs in food production and alternate uses of food (i.e., feed, fertiliser, bio-based materials and energy) and its circularity (waste collection and treatment services). Given the availability of energy projections data (see below), fossil and renewable commodities are split out. Remaining activities are grouped into manufacturing and services industries. With an EU focus, a regional aggregation features 22 member states, with groupings for (i) Cyprus, Malta and Greece and (ii) Luxembourg with Belgium. Continental classifications are used to aggregate remaining non-EU regions. A detailed list of the commodity and regional aggregation is in Section S4 of the Supplementary materials document. As a common adjunct to simulation modelling assessments, a credible ‘business-as-usual’ medium-term baseline is implemented that represents a continuation of existing trends. It is assumed that FLW attitudes and behaviour remain unchanged from past trends (see Section S5 of the Supplementary materials document for an overview of the baseline assumptions used in the study). This baseline is split into an update period (2014–2020) and a projection period (2020–2030). The end year is chosen to coincide with the SDG target 12.3 timeframe. To motivate the baseline exogenous shocks, this study draws on the long-term Global Energy and Climate Outlook (GECO) (Keramidas et al., 2021 ), of the European Commission. At the outset, this publication offers a contemporary comprehensive and consistent set of world-wide economic, demographic, energy market and climate policy projections to 2050. Typically, exogenous projections of GDP and population dominate, by conditioning expected income per capita trends by region. These trends drive final demands, which in turn motivate changes in supply activities and investment. Employing further data sources, the baseline also includes land and forestry productivity shocks, agricultural and biofuels policy shocks and per capita food preference trends. Comparing with this baseline, in the period 2020–2030, a scenario implements a halving of 2020 levels of household food waste in each of the EU MS. To capture the costs associated with this behavioural change, the ‘waste tax’ on collection services corresponding to domestic and imported food commodity demands is increased to target these reductions.   4 Results Sections 4.1 to 4.3  present the results of the baseline to 2030, with a focus on FLW generation quantities and the associated costs of waste collection. In Sections 4.4 to 4.7 , results are presented in comparison with the baseline from a halving of per capita household food waste compared with 2020 levels. The results show the impacts on FLW quantities, the competitiveness of the agricultural sector, the environmental impacts and the circularity repercussions. 4.1 Baseline: waste generation on a level playing field Fig. 6  shows the progression of EU Member State FLW in kilograms (kg) per capita for 2014, 2020 and 2030. The reported baseline trends are assumed to be in the absence of any additional public policy measures. Thus, the EU average rises 10.2 % from 116.5 kg/capita in 2014 to 128.4 kg/capita in 2020. As a key hypothesis of the current study, we find that by 2030, EU average FLW per capita stabilises at 127.8 kg/capita (a drop of −0.45 % compared with 2020). Whilst EU per capita incomes continue to rise, per capita food demand increases (compared with non-food demand increases) are slower due to typically lower income elasticities of demand (Engel's Law). Behind this EU average FLW per capita statistic, lies a range of projected EU member state outcomes (Fig. 6 ) ranging from Croatia (lowest) to Denmark (highest). This heterogeneity of outcomes is a direct consequence of the structure of the official Eurostat data employed in the model, which reflects differences in food system efficiencies and consumption habits across EU member states.  4.2 Baseline: changing food consumption habits and food waste generation A further driver of the FLW per capita trend, is the changing food consumption habits in EU member states. A telling statistic is the quantity of household food waste (i.e., household and food services (bars restaurants)) per euro of household expenditure. For example, based on the data for 2014, for each euro spent in the EU, on average 244 g of waste is created, of which approximately 60 % (147 g) is from home consumption of crop products (e.g., bread, fresh fruit and vegetables – not shown). In the 2014–2020 period, EU27 food waste quantity rises 8.6 % (Fig. 7  , blue bar, far right) to 265 g per euro spent in 2020, and by 2030, it only increases a further 0.4 % to 266 g per euro spent (Fig. 7 , orange bar, far right). This EU-wide trend is driven by the newer EU economies (e.g., Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania). In these regions, with more rapid rises in per capita income growth, there is a steady behavioural substitution away from home consumption to more expensive and more income elastic out-of-home food services demand. There is evidence drawing a causal link between rising per capita incomes and the switch toward increased out-of-home food consumption in the USA (Saksena et al., 2018 ), China (You, 2014 ) and India (Smith, 2015 ). Moreover, official historical Eurostat (2023b)  data shows that between 2013 (last wave of EU accession) and 2019 (pre-pandemic year), expenditures on restaurants and hotels in the EU13 (2004 and 2013 accession EU members) accelerated by 63.6 %, compared with only 29.6 % for pre-2004 EU member states. Thus, in many of the newer EU economies, household waste per euro spent  in the decade to 2030 (orange bars) falls back. In many of the ‘mature’ economies of the EU, this behavioural change is not exhibited, such that food waste per euro spent between 2020 and 2030 continues to rise (Fig. 7 ). Aggregate FLW rises initially from 51.6 million tonnes in 2014 to 56.5 million tonnes by 2020. With the fall in grams of FLW per euro spent, by 2030, total FLW rises moderately to 57.1 million tonnes. In relation to the 2014 data in Fig. 5  above, Fig. 8   shows the percentage change deviation between 2014 and 2030 in the baseline, decomposing EU FLW along the food chain into its component parts. EU household food demand growth is ‘relatively’ slower due to sluggish growth in per capita food demands (inelastic income demands). Assuming no significant improvements in production efficiency to reduce food losses, the growth in household driven waste has therefore not kept pace with supply-side driven food losses. Indeed, the baseline shows continued rises in EU agri-food production with rises in EU self-sufficiency (e.g., the EU agrifood trade balance improves from just over €10 billion euros in 2014, to €24 billion by 2030 - not shown). Thus, the general picture is that of a rise in the share attributed to supply chain related food losses. For the whole EU, household food waste (including food services consumption) that accounted for 64.4 % of the total in 2014 (Fig. 6 ), falls 5 % by 2030 (Fig. 8 , right side column). There are concomitant EU average rises in post-harvest losses (7.3 %), processing losses (10.1 %) and retail and transport losses (8.8 %).  4.3 Baseline: costs of food waste collection In Table 1  , the average cost of food waste treatment in euros per tonne is shown, calculated as the expenditure by households on the three classes of waste collection services (million euros), divided by the corresponding quantity flows (thousand tonnes). Following Hoornweg and Bhada-Tata (2012) , at the starting point of 2014, incineration is assumed twice as expensive as landfill, largely because of the high initial capital costs of incineration plants. With rising capital, labour and energy costs and increasing waste collection demand (as a function of rising waste generation), the general trend is a gentle rise in collection costs. The EU average cost of green waste collection for composting, rises from €122.12/t in 2014 to €125.54/t in 2030. Similarly, the unit cost of grey (or other) food waste collection for landfill (incineration) rises from €91.30 (€182.60/t) in 2014 to €101.67/t (€184.54/t) by 2030.  4.4 Comparing with the baseline: halving 2020 household food waste levels Fig. 9   is a Sankey diagram that illustrates FLW generation along the entire food life cycle. The first filter shows five aggregate commodity classifications upon which FLW is generated. The second filter classifies waste types, namely, losses in primary agriculture (“post-harvest), downstream food processing losses (“processing”), retail and distribution losses (“retail”) and household food waste (“food”). The concept ‘other’, is a collective of predominantly garden waste, but also other residual sources of waste. Halving the 2020 levels of household food waste, the Sankey diagram numbers in brackets indicate the absolute levels of EU FLW in 2030 after household food waste driven reductions (measured in million tonnes) and the resulting waste treatment emissions (million tonnes of CO2 equivalent - MtCO2 e). The boxes in orange show the impact relative to the baseline in 2030. The results reveal an EU-wide household food waste reduction of 16.6 million tonnes (47.7 %) compared with the 2030 baseline. The fall in household food waste reduces demand for food with an accompanying contraction in EU agrifood production (see Section 4.5 ). As a result, EU post-harvest losses, processed food losses and retail and transport losses also fall 253 thousand tonnes (−3.4 %), 400 thousand tonnes (−3.5 %) and 255 thousand tonnes (−5.6 %), respectively. Overall, the halving of food waste consistent with target 12.3 of the SDGs leads to an EU FLW fall of 17.5 million tonnes. This is equivalent to a 30.6 % reduction compared with the 2030 baseline, although in some EU regions (e.g., Austria, Czechia, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden) this percentage fall is noticeably higher than the EU average (not shown), whilst in other cases (e.g., Bulgaria, Greece/Cyprus/Malta, Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Spain) it is markedly lower. This heterogeneity of outcomes reflects the varying share of household food waste in total food loss and waste in each of the member states compared with the EU average, as indicated in Fig. 5  above. Measured in per capita terms (Fig. 10  ), the halving of 2020 levels of household food waste amounts to an EU average fall of 39.3 kg in FLW, compared with the 2030 baseline. Examining the EU member states, the highest relative falls are recorded in Portugal (66.3 kg/capita), Austria (53.9 kg/capita), Ireland (53.7 kg/capita) and Germany (52.8 kg/capita). The lowest per capita reductions are observed in Bulgaria (11.7 kg/capita), Spain (18.1 kg/capita) and Croatia (20.9 kg/capita). These upper- and lower limit outcomes are largely conditioned by the structure of the official Eurostat data, namely (i) the share of household waste in total FLW (Fig. 5 , blue bars) and (ii) the absolute size of per capita FLW in each of the EU member states. For example, Portugal, Germany and Austria all exhibit FLW per capita levels that are someway above the EU average in the baseline (from 2014 to 2030). Moreover, in all three countries, the share of total FLW that is related to household waste is also well above the EU average. Thus, a 50 % reduction in household waste in these countries affects a larger regional share value with a higher absolute value of per capita FLW. In Ireland, the household waste share value of total FLW starts below the EU average, but because per capita FLW grows so rapidly by 2030 (Irish real GDP projections are very high in the baseline), Irish per capita FLW in the baseline by 2030, rises well above the EU average (second only after Portugal). Thus, a 50 % reduction in household waste leads to a significant reduction (from a high baseline 2030 value). In Bulgaria and Spain, both countries exhibit a relatively smaller household food waste share in total FLW, and both report per capita FLW levels that are below the EU average. Thus, the relative falls in per capita FLW are also relatively smaller. Finally, despite a high household waste share of total FLW, Croatia has the lowest absolute per capita waste generation in the EU. Thus, the relative reduction in FLW per capita in 2030 is from a smaller baseline value. The rising waste tax to achieve desired cuts in waste generation, leads to increasing waste collection and treatment costs (assuming perfect price transmission). Thus, comparing with the 2030 baseline cost estimates shown in Table 1 , the cost per unit of household food waste for composting, incineration and landfilling rises 56.76€/t, 87.85€/t and 52.59€/t, respectively. In proportional terms this represents a 45–50 % increase in waste collection costs.  4.5 Comparing with the baseline: rising food affordability and security but falling agrifood production and agricultural employment With previous impact assessments showing price falls, a key testable hypothesis of this study was the anticipated impact on food prices in the presence of the waste behaviour tax. On the one hand, food waste behaviour tax increases the per unit composite price of food commodity ‘c’. On the other hand, the reduction in aggregate food demand (due to less food wastage), the strength of which is determined by the waste rate of each commodity ‘c’, depresses food prices. Overall, the latter effect was found to dominate the former. Fig. 11   shows that for vegetables and fruits (where food waste rates are typically higher), the index of EU market price falls 4.1 % and 2.3 %, respectively, compared with the baseline in 2030. In cereals, the market price falls are smaller (1.6 %) despite high rates of waste, largely due to the relatively smaller share of final food demands for cereals (compared to their use as inputs to animal feeds, bio-based material and energy). Elsewhere, by 2030 the index of meat and dairy prices falls 1.2 % and 1.1 %, respectively, compared with the baseline, whilst the corresponding general agri-food price index falls 1.8 %. In 2030, the baseline projected EU primary agricultural and agrifood (i.e., primary agriculture plus processed food) production totals are 818 and 1111 million tonnes, respectively (Fig. 12  , orange boxes). With the halving of household food waste, by 2030, the estimated reduction in EU agricultural production is 15.5 million tonnes (1.9 %). In the case of agrifood production, the corresponding production drop is 23.7 million tonnes (2.1 %). To contextualise, both these estimates approximately tally with Austria's agricultural and agrifood production in 2020. The contraction in agricultural output is accompanied by an EU agricultural employment fall of 144 thousand workers (−1.6 %) (not shown), equivalent to approximately 90 % of the estimated agricultural workforce of the Netherlands. In the baseline, the EU maintains a high degree of food security with an estimated agrifood trade surplus of €23.7 billion in 2030 (Fig. 13  , orange box). With reduced internal demand, EU self-sufficiency for agri-food products rises. By 2030, the relative improvement in the EU agri-food trade balance is €7.8 billion, of which €3.8 billion is from primary agricultural commodities, particularly fruit (€1.0 billion – not shown) and vegetables (€0.5 billion – not shown); and €4.0 billion from processed foods such as red and white meat (€1.0 billion each – not shown) and dairy (€0.6 billion – not shown).  4.6 Comparing with the baseline: reduced EU agricultural land use, emissions and ‘leakage’ Consistent with the result of EC (2022a) , our baseline reports a moderate fall in total agricultural land use, from approximately 157.5 million hectares in 2020 (not shown) to 157.1 million hectares in 2030, as yield improvements outstrip demand driven rises in production. With the halving of household food waste, relative EU agricultural land use falls by a further 0.64 million hectares (not shown) or 0.41 % (approximately equivalent to the agricultural land area of Slovenia). Most of this reduction (0.49 million hectares, or 0.74 %) comes from pastureland reductions, as food crops are rediverted into animal feed uses. The 2030 baseline reports direct EU agricultural emissions of 418 MtCO2 e by 2030 (not shown). Comparing with the baseline in 2030, the relative agricultural production falls reported above due to FLW reductions, generates direct agricultural emissions falls of 7.5 MtCO2 e (1.7 %) (not shown). In the baseline, EU household driven ‘virtual’ demand for land and emissions contracts (Fig. 14  ). Motivated by productivity rises and a rising EU population, baseline per capita land footprints (square metres per capita per year - m2 /pc/py) fall from 2899 m2 /pc/py in 2020, to 2680 m2 /pc/py by 2030. Similarly, per capita emissions footprints (kilograms of CO2  equivalent per capita per year - kgCO2 e/pc/py) fall from 1431 kgCO2 e/pc/py in 2020 to 1368 kgCO2 e/pc/py by 2030. With the halving of household food waste, land and emissions footprints fall a further 80 m2 /pc/py and 50 kgCO2 e/pc/py, respectively. As a measure of reduced EU ‘leakage’, the result is that by 2030, the EU's virtual net trade deficit for land improves from −14.3 million hectares in the baseline, to −12.0 million hectares. Similarly, for emissions in 2030, the EU's virtual net trade deficit contracts from −31.4 MtCO2 e to −27.2 MtCO2 e.  4.7 Comparing with the baseline: reduced waste, reduced circularity As described in Fig. 3 , FLW is collected as green or grey waste. Green waste can be used for composting, which is an input for bio-fertiliser and bio-energy sectors. Grey waste is used for landfilling and incineration (used for bio-heating). With economic growth, rising demands and increasing waste generation, the baseline index of output (2014 = 100) in Fig. 15   shows, as expected, increasing EU output and turnover trends in the waste collection and treatment sectors. With the halving of household food waste and the rising costs of food waste collection noted above, by 2030 EU green waste collection falls by 28.7 % (€1.4 billion) compared with the baseline, with the composting of waste falling 29.2 % (€0.5 billion). Falling composting reduces the availability of bio-based fertiliser. Despite this, fossil fertiliser usage in EU cereals, fruits and vegetables sectors still falls 6.9 %, 2.7 % and 4.2 %, respectively, compared with the baseline in 2030 (not shown) due to relative reductions in crop production. Grey waste collection also falls 12.4 % (€1.9 billion) compared with the baseline in 2030, with the result that incineration also falls by 10.4 % (€0.6 billion).   5 Discussion A key novel insight offered in this study is the link between rational waste generating behaviour by producers and consumers and estimates of quantity changes in FLW flows over time. As suggested above, per capita FLW in the EU rises much slower in the decade up to 2030 due to changing household food consumption patterns. Other evidence suggests, however, that our baseline trend for per capita food waste generation may be optimistic (i.e., low). For example, two studies (Verma et al., 2021 ; Lopez-Barrera and Hertel, 2021 ) tentatively posit a positive causal link between rising food waste rates and per capita income increases, although this effect is more marked in rapidly developing middle-income economies. In the current study, baseline waste rates on a commodity basis are assumed to remain relatively stable (determined by the inelastic substitution between food demands and food waste generation - see Section 3.2.2 ). Additional econometric rigour helped by further annual releases of Eurostat FLW data estimates (panel data), would deepen the evidence base on FLW rates as EU economies grow. This statistically observed empiricism could then be used to refine the baseline calibration of the elasticity of substitution between food consumption and waste rates. There is also evidence of ‘policy coherence’ between the implementation of target 12.3 of the SDGs and proposed F2F supply side reforms (described in the introduction). Indeed, the European Commission's in-house modelling assessment of the F2F (Barreiro-Hurle et al., 2021 ) reports rising food prices and reduced food security. Despite the implementation of the waste behaviour tax, food waste cuts are shown to be synergetic with improved food affordability (falling food prices), whilst falling demand improves food security (agri-food trade balance) and reduces ‘leakage’ (land, emissions). In an era of geopolitical tensions giving rise to energy, fertiliser and food market instability driving calls for greater EU ‘strategic autonomy’, as well as the rising threat of adverse weather conditions, these outcomes are to be welcomed. The strength of these market signals should, however, be treated with some caution. The definition of waste in Eurostat (EC, 2019 ) and SDG target 12.3 (UNEP, 2021 ), does not discriminate between avoidable (i.e., edible) and unavoidable (i.e., inedible bones, banana skins, eggshells) elements. Subsequently, in the absence of additional data, the waste quantity reductions modelled here should be considered as upper bound reductions. This observation is particularly salient for vegetable and fruits, where the proportion of unavoidable food waste is higher. A comparison with other modelling studies reveals that the negative impacts on EU agriculture are smaller than in Rutten et al. (2013)  and Philippidis et al. (2019) , who also employ comparable 50 % reductions to food waste. In the current study, the relative EU real GDP contraction compared with the baseline (−0.02 %) is below the −0.1 % estimate reported in Rutten et al. (2013)  and the upper range fall of −0.5 % in Philippidis et al. (2019) . Similarly, by 2030 agricultural employment in our study falls 1.7 % compared with the baseline, vis-à-vis a corresponding fall estimate of 2.9 % in Philippidis et al. (2019) . The ‘softer landing’ reported here is related to the redistribution of (waste behaviour) tax revenues. In our model, tax revenues are reinserted into the economy in the form of expenditures (assuming fixed savings rates). In other studies, the mechanism of reintroducing waste behaviour tax revenues is absent. As a logical extension, a future line of research could assess ‘double-dividend’ (e.g., Fraser and Waschik, 2013 ) or ‘win-win' outcomes through recycled waste behaviour tax revenues to support rural incomes in more vulnerable farming areas, or target retraining programs (e.g., EC, 2022b ) for displaced agricultural labour. In a manner akin to green- (e.g., emissions) or dietary taxes that seek to achieve socially desirable goals, ‘waste-behaviour’ taxes face the political challenge of their social acceptance. Limited evidence supports the effectiveness of waste behaviour taxes (Carattini et al., 2018 ; Briguglio, 2021 ). Research also suggests, however, that public perceptions must be overcome (Carattini et al., 2018 ), whilst it is posited that if punitive costs are set too high, there is a danger of illegal waste disposal from non-conformers (Briguglio, 2021 ; Hegwood et al., 2023 ). Real world examples of socially responsible taxes in Denmark and the UK, under the guise of fat-taxes and sugar taxes, respectively, have not prospered. Tselengidis and Östergren (2019)  observe, for example, that the tactical approach in opposition of sugar taxes in the EU, was akin to that of the tobacco industry. Clear promises by government to the electorate on the use of waste taxes to pursue socially desirable goals (as discussed above) should be considered as a strategy to favourably sway public opinion. An alternate future line of research, not considered here, would be the pursuit of ‘positive’ market signals to achieve FLW reductions. For example, examining efficient food waste sorting behaviour, there is limited evidence in China that ‘reward points’ schemes can incentivise more active participation (Li et al., 2017 ). Similarly, subsidies on socially desirable behaviour (often in tandem with marketing information) have been shown to be effective in increasing the uptake of healthier diets en masse  (Alston et al., 2016 ; Chang et al., 2015 ; Klerman et al., 2014 ). The EU's circular economy action plan (EC, 2020c ) calls for a more sustainable management of avoidable food waste levels and enhanced value-added recovery rates in unavoidable wasted food. On the former, D'Adamo et al. (2023)  explore the consumer-retailer nexus and conclude that improved information exchange via phone apps and dynamic pricing models to incentivise purchase, play a key role in reducing unnecessary waste. This behavioural component is absent from our model, although it could be characterised employing technology-change shifters. There are also uncertainties attached to our projections of available food waste streams for composting and incineration (bioheat). The promotion of more efficient collection systems that are compatible with the patterns of daily life of EU citizens, (i.e., improved separation of bio-waste at source) could potentially reap significant gains for high-quality recycling and reuse (Schüch et al., 2019 ). Mak et al. (2020)  reveal other factors that impact the certainty of food waste supplies. Most notably, the quality of food waste and its sourcing (from households, distributors, restaurants) is highly variable, which requires coordinated transport and storage infrastructure. Mak et al. (2020)  also note that the absence of legislative support and public engagement discourages potential investors, whilst the commercial viability of bio-based material products remains unfavourable compared with fossil substitutes. As is common to all simulation modelling exercises, there are limitations. The first limitation is that simulation models are a simplification of reality, where the sensitivity of stakeholders (i.e., consumers, producers, investors) to changing market conditions (e.g., prices, incomes) is governed by parameters (i.e., elasticities) that remain invariant. As a result, these parameters become less valid for characterising behavioural transformations over longer time frames. The second limitation is that endogenous FLW behaviour in a price dependent simulation model is restricted to targeted waste-behaviour taxes, whilst endogenous non-price driven attitudinal shifts due to philanthropic, cultural, ethnic, stakeholder influence or political factors are not modelled. Veselá et al. (2023)  and Casonato et al. (2023)  identify numerous non price drivers of food waste behaviour by consumers, with both studies recommending social awareness initiatives via publicity campaigns and educational programs. The vertically integrated nature of FLW in food supply chains has prompted other commentators to advocate the extension of non-price prevention measures to encompass all stakeholders along the food supply chain (Jeswani et al., 2021 ; Sharma et al., 2023 ). As an example, Surucu-Balci and Tuna (2022)  employ ‘stakeholder identification' theory to pinpoint optimal cooperation between supply-chain actors to tackle FLW in the fruit and vegetables supply chain and devise tailored communication and coordination mitigation strategies (e.g., data-, technology-, infrastructure sharing) to optimise FLW reductions. This is a pertinent observation given that our baseline results project a rising share of losses in total FLW. An endogenous characterisation of these stakeholder interactions is currently beyond the reach of simulation modelling and represents an area of future research. A further limitation relates to the uncertain quality of the FLW data employed in this study owing to the difficulties in measuring FLW (as discussed in Section 2 ) and the potential bias on model results. The recently published EU member state Eurostat (2023a)  FLW data employed here contains rich structural differences in the FLW shares by leverage points (Fig. 6 ) and absolute levels of per capita FLW (Fig. 7 ). As we show, data heterogeneity across member states heavily influences the model results. Whilst member state dispersion of FLW shares is to be expected owing to differing food production efficiencies and consumption habits, there is also potential bias due to data measurement issues. The technical documentation EC (2019)  recognises discrepancies between certain member states possibly attributed to (inter alia) differences or misinterpretations in definitions used by data reporters, limitations in sample sizes, exclusion of smaller sectors or business and survey bias.  6 Conclusions The EU farm-to-fork strategy (F2F) proposes a transition toward a sustainably responsible model of food consumption and production. This paper aims to develop a modelling tool for projecting detailed plausible estimates of food loss and waste (FLW) by EU member state and examine the importance of proposed food waste reductions as a tool for alleviating perceived F2F supply-side driven agri-food market tensions. A theoretically consistent novel characterisation of rational FLW generating behaviour by producers and consumers is implemented and linked to recently published Eurostat FLW estimates. Furthermore, the internalisation of the costs of FLW reductions is modelled through waste behaviour taxes, whilst the issue of circularity is tackled by representing FLW collection, processing and treatment technologies. Driven by assumptions of real GDP and population growth, a ‘business-as-usual’ baseline indicates continued rises in average EU per capita FLW generation from 116.6 kg per capita in 2014 to 127.8 kg per capita by 2030. In the decade leading up to 2030, however, this trend stabilises due to sluggish food demand (lower income elasticity) and a behavioural switch in the less mature EU economies away from home consumption toward out-of-home food services consumption. Importantly, the share of total FLW coming from food losses grows over time to 2030. Consistent with target 12.3 of the Sustainable Development Goals, halving 2020 levels of EU household food waste leads to total FLW falls of 17.5 million tonnes compared with the baseline in 2030. This is equivalent to a per capita FLW fall of 39.3 kg per capita. Moreover, despite the presence of waste behaviour taxes, relative EU average agrifood prices fall 1.8 %. Also, the EU trade balance (i.e., self-sufficiency) improves €7.8 billion, whilst EU virtual land and emissions deficits (i.e., leakage) fall 2.3 million hectares and 4.2 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, respectively. Unfortunately, there are concomitant losses in EU primary agricultural production and employment of 1.9 % and 1.6 % (144 thousand workers), respectively. In the absence of policy driven improvements in bio-waste recycling or separation at source, the assumed cut in household food waste reduces composted bio-based waste streams (used as biofertilizer and bio-energy) by 29 % compared with the baseline, whilst incineration (used for bio-heating) falls by 10 %. Despite this, however, there is no increased uptake of fossil fertiliser compared with the baseline in 2030, due to the contraction in EU crop production. Concluding, the rising projected share of food losses in the baseline signals a need for reinforced stakeholder communication and coordination strategies which are receiving less attention than consumer behaviour, hindering efficient responses to mitigate FLW. Finally, in seeking a ‘win-win' outcome for all stakeholders (particularly farmers) and increasing their social acceptance, member state governments should clearly signal the channelling of ‘waste behaviour’ tax revenues into supporting income- and employment retraining schemes.
