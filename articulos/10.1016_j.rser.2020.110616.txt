A major technological breakthrough came in the early 1980s with the discovery of permanent magnets based on the tetragonal compound Neodymium–Iron–Boron (NdFeB), which was announced by both the Sumitomo Corporation in Japan and General Motors in the United States [2 ,3 ]. Research and developments with NdFeB-based Rare Earth Magnets (REM) have intensified due to the use of these components in electric cars, high-efficiency wind generators, and high-efficiency electric motors, which require optimized magnetic properties such as high product-maximum energy, coercivity, and remanence [4 ]. NdFeB magnets are essential to the transition into a cleaner energy matrix, supporting the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number 7: “Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all ”. Also, REMs are a key technology for enabling energy-efficient electric cars and advanced machines, satisfying SDG 13: “Climate Action ” and SDG 11: “Sustainable Cities and Communities ”. However, the production of Rare Earth Elements (REE), the main raw material for REM, generates significant social and environmental impacts [5 ,6 ], since heavy chemical components are used, e. g sulfuric and hydrochloric acid [7 ], besides that, during its extraction, radioactive co-products such as thorium and uranium can be generated [6 ]. Hence, the sustainability of REM production must be thoroughly explored. Sustainability considerations in the metals and mining industry are quite complex. Historically, mining has been identified as responsible for causing environmental degradation and health problems, motivating population displacement, aggravating economic and social inequalities, armed conflict, tax evasion, and corruption [8 ]. However, if well managed, it can create jobs, stimulate innovation, and bring investment and infrastructure on a scale of long-term change [8 ,9 ]. It is important to highlight the need to analyze the specifics of each business so that sustainability actions are effective. Therefore, “ready-made recipes” should not be used, which is effective for one company or sector, may simply not be applicable to another, then business priorities, culture, stakeholder needs, and stakeholders must be taken into account as specific business challenges [9 ]. Taking into account this need for sector-specific analysis, the United Nations, in conjunction with other institutions developed the report Mapping Mining to the SDGs: An Atlas.  This document analyses the 17 SDGs and its targets in detail, linking them with the mining sector context, and presents a map containing sustainable practices examples that can be adopted by the companies [8 ]. However, this is a general guide for the mining industry and does not provide special insights into the context of REM. Additionally to the practical sectorial guides like this, the scientific literature has also been investigating the challenges and opportunities to achieve the SDGs in diverse areas. Acheampong et al. (2017) sought to understand how biofuels can contribute to achieving the SDGs [10 ] and Endl et al. (2019) [11 ] studied how the European mining industries are acting or can act through innovations to achieve the sustainable development. Thus, each productive sector must properly understand its specificities to then be able to draw action plans and manage the goals through sustainable development. REE are 17 elements, used for several products since fluorescent lamps, batteries, solar panels, magnets, until fertilizer, comprising a varied range of industry contexts. Among the 17 REE, three are mainly used in REM production: neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium. According to Dong et al. (2017) [12 ], there are 250 companies producing REM in the world. Studies have been carried out to understand the impacts of this sector and how it can be configured in a more sustainable way [13 ,14 ]. However, the scientific literature concerning the sustainability of REM production is dispersed in several studies, none of them bring a holistic overview, or bring insights about reaching the SDGs. This lack of systematized information can lead to ineffective and unaligned actions. In addition, since 2014, actions are being taken to develop a sustainable REM productive chain in Brazil, once there are unexploited REE deposits in the country. Currently, the major effort is being the implementation of a REM factory, which was designed to develop new REM sustainable manufacturing technologies. Therefore, to guarantee the sustainability of this project, it is essential to understand which REM-sustainability aspects are relevant. A comprehensive view on how sustainability has been adopted in the REM industry is the first step in leading companies, governments, and the scientific community in the transition towards more sustainable production. In this scenario, the objective of this review paper is to investigate the research panorama on REM-sustainability and, thereafter evaluate the initiatives undertaken and reported in the scientific literature, in terms of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT), according to their potential for contributing to attaining the SDGs. The main findings of this research may foster sustainability practices in the REM industry. This paper is structured in four sections: Section 1  presents this introduction. Section 2  (Methods) provides details about the methods applied for literature selection and analysis. Section 3  (Results and Discussion) presents the performed literature review. Finally, section 4  (Conclusions) summarizes the main outcomes of this study.  2 Methods This paper aims to identify major works on REM sustainability, thereafter, to classify them into research areas and evaluate them according to their potential to contribute to SDG, in terms of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. The research approach adopted was the Systematic Review (SR) combined with SWOT analysis. According to Kitchenham (2004) [15 ], SR can identify gaps in existing research, as well as providing an existing knowledge base to support further research. The term SR refers to a specific research methodology and aims at gathering and evaluating available documents on a particular theme. Because it is a formal way of reviewing, SR follows an established sequence [16 ]. The three steps recommended by Kitchenham (2004) [15 ] were followed: planning, execution, and analysis of the review. Fig. 1   presents an overview of the procedures followed in this research. 2.1 Planning The scope definition was stated as the following question: What is the research panorama on REM-sustainability? How are the REM-sustainability studies interconnected? How REM can contribute to achieving the SDGs? Thereafter, the databases Scopus and Web of Science were selected, and lastly, two groups of keywords to be applied in the database searching were delineated: ((sustainab* OR “circular economy” OR “life cycle” OR footprint) AND “rare earth") The final portfolio of papers satisfied the following inclusion criteria: a) addressing sustainability aspects (social, environmental, and economic) of NdFeB magnets production or use, which is the most commercialized REM type; and b) Addressing possible solutions to achieve the SDGs in rare earth industry of Neodymium, Praseodymium and Dysprosium.  2.2 Execution The database search included articles that were published or were “in press ” by December 2019. New articles that may have been published since then are not included in this work. The search on the Scopus database presented 579 results and the Web of Science database presented 564 results. After the duplicates removing, 774 titles and abstracts were analyzed. Lastly, 44 articles were included in the final portfolio for meeting the inclusion criteria.  2.3 Analysis In this step, firstly a content analysis was performed, and four main research subjects of studies were identified (Table 1  ). Next, a SWOT analysis was conducted. SWOT is a management tool usually carried out in a corporate business strategic plan to verify a company's strategic position [58 ]. This tool helps to identify the positive points, as well as the main problems, increasing opportunities and checking the company's risks, allowing for better decision making [59 ], and recently has been used to provide comprehensive synopsis in diverse areas [59 ,60 ]. In this study, SWOT was adapted to allow comparing the current REM-sustainability literature concerning the achievement of the SDG and its targets. The SDG contains a set of 17 measures and 169 targets across many areas, to achieve sustainable development by 2030 and was developed by the United Nations in conjunction with its member countries [61 ]. SDGs became officially applicable from January 2016. The SWOT checking was performed comparing the information contained in the reviewed papers with the 17 SDGs and its targets specially selected for Mining and Metals industry, also indicating suggestions on how to integrate sustainable practices into the core business, presented by Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment (2016) [8 ]. Strengths were identified when a topic brings positive results to SDG, weaknesses were identified when improvements on a topic should be made to achieve SDG, opportunities were identified when a topic indicates possible new directions of studies/results that encompass the SDGs, and threats were identified when a topic brings results that confront SDG.   3 Results and Discussion 3.1 General analysis of research REM-sustainability topic has gained special interest and popularity within the research community since 2017, as 77% (34 articles) of the publications have been made since 2017. This suggests the REM-sustainability topic is a relatively new and emerging research field. NdFeB magnets are applied to equipment whose demand will increase, as wind power generators and electric cars [26 ], so the trend of REM-sustainability publications may be expected to continue increasing in the next few years. Germany is the major contributor to REM-sustainability publications with 12% of the publications (10 articles), followed by the Netherlands (8 articles) and the United States (7 articles). The result shows that the developed countries are the main researchers in this area. In terms of the number of publications per journal, Journal of Cleaner Production (7 articles), ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering (4 articles), Journal of Sustainable Metallurgy (3 articles), and International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment (3 articles) contributes with 39% of the total number of REM-sustainability publications. REM-sustainability topic is suitable to be published in a wide range of specialized journals. This may explain the wide range of different journals (i.e. 29) where the rare earth magnets-sustainability topic has been published. Finally, Buchert, M. and Marx. Are the authors with more publications on this topic (four publications each).  3.2 Research subjects of identified studies and SWOT analysis After the content analysis, it was possible to recognize four main research subjects of studies: environmental impact; social impact; economic aspects, and circular economy. The next subsection presents each research subject in detail and its impacts on the SDGs. It should be noted that some articles fall in more than one subject, and some SDGs fall in more than one SWOT aspect. 3.2.1 Environmental impact Environmental impact analysis measures the use of resources from nature and the environmental consequences of releases throughout a product's life cycle, from raw material extraction to production, use, end-of-life (EOL), disposal, and recycling. It assists in the identification of hotspots for improvement throughout the life cycle of a product system, providing decision-makers in industry and government with information on process/product (re)design, strategic planning, and marketing [69 ,70 ]. A total of 15 papers quantitatively analyze the environmental impacts associated with the life cycle of REM or a REM-containing product. Several authors have analyzed the production of NdFeB magnets from primary resources [17 ,18 ,22 ,23 ,31 ], and secondary resources [20 ,21 ,27 ,30 ,31 ,71 ], mostly from Hard Disk Drives. In terms of the application of magnets, Ozoemena et al. (2018) [72 ] and Schreiber et al. (2019) [26 ] analyzed the impacts related to magnets in wind power generators. Monfared et al. (2014) [32 ] studied the production of household refrigerators and Hernandez et al. (2017) [18 ] and Nordelöf et al. (2019) [28 ] analyzed the use of magnets for high-temperature applications in electric vehicle motors. Two papers focus on constructing a Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) model for future Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) analysis of an electrical automotive traction machine [24 ,25 ]. Other authors focused on the production of neodymium and dysprosium from secondary resources [20 ,21 ,27 ]. The intended audience of these studies are magnet manufacturers, comparing results from different process and resource efficiencies; research community, establishing benchmarks for process efficiency and impact generated; policymakers, establishing initiatives to promote new technologies development and set limits for the impact caused during the production of magnets; magnet consumers, relying on the supply of high-quality REM. Sprecher et al. (2014) [31 ] have identified electricity consumption, and consequently its generation, as the major contributor to the environmental impact for REM production from primary resources. The authors also state that the Nickel used in electroplating generates around 40% of the total impact of freshwater ecotoxicity (kg 1,4-DCB-equivalent), photochemical oxidation (kg ethylene-equivalent), and ozone depletion (kg CFC-11-equivalent), with the remainder being related to energy production. Marx et al. (2018) [22 ], however, state that the consumption of chemicals is the most relevant impact, followed by energy consumption. The authors analyzed permanent magnet production not only from Bayan Obo, in China, but also two major deposits outside China: Mount Weld, in Australia, and Mountain Pass, in the United States of America (USA). Considering these deposits, Marx et al. (2018) [22 ] and Wulf et al. (2017) [17 ] agree that production from China is the most environmentally harmful of the three deposits. Arshi et al. (2018) [23 ] also state that the solvent extraction stage is the main contributor for most impact categories due to its intense chemical consumption, with shares of over 35% of impact in global warming potential (kg CO2 -equivalent), eutrophication (kg NOx -equivalent), and human toxicity (kg 1,4-DCB-equivalent). Regarding human toxicity, Marx et al. (2018) [22 ] and Wulf et al. (2017) [17 ] have contrasting results to those previously reported by Sprecher et al. (2014) [31 ], who reported that the most significant normalized impact is human toxicity, being generated mainly due to hydrogen fluoride, HF(g), formation during acid roasting of bastnasite. However, Sprecher et al. (2014) [31 ] relies entirely on the Ecoinvent database for permanent magnet production [46 ,47 ], which considers that the REEs used in the magnet are originated from a deposit where bastnäsite is the only REE-carrier mineral. This assumption overestimates the generation of HF(g). Wulf et al. (2017) [17 ], on the other hand, take into account the intrinsic differences in composition for the REE-carrier minerals in each deposit, having a more accurate estimation of the human toxicity impact. For magnets produced from secondary resources, the majority of the impact comes from electricity usage for size reduction and sintering [71 ] and the addition of fresh materials, such as nickel for electroplating [31 ]. Overall, magnets produced from secondary resources have significantly less environmental impact than those produced from primary resources [31 ,71 ],. Furthermore, magnets produced from secondary resources have a great advantage of not generating any radioactive waste, compared to primary production where these elements are normally present in significant amounts, depending on the geological settings. However, the recycling of magnets requires solid collection schemes and transportation infrastructure. According to Sprecher et al. (2014) [31 ], 64% of the total neodymium input is lost along the production chain, and great impacts are related to energy and chemical consumption and its production [22 ], also, the extraction phase is critical, due to the residual sludge which is a hazardous substance [27 ], highlighting that process efficiency and emission control is crucial [31 ]. Additionally, leachate of mining areas, discharge of industrial waste, and weathering of deposits contribute to the presence of REEs in surface and groundwater. It causes damage to humans, flora, and fauna. In humans, rare earth elements accumulate in the human body and can cause kidney stones. In animals, REEs affect their organic functions, such as reproductive development in terrestrial and aquatic animals. Finally, the plants have their germination, root and shoot development, and flowering processes affected [24 ]. If badly managed, these impacts can make the achievement of SDGs unrealistic. Therefore, the identification of the production stages with the greatest environmental impacts is a crucial step towards creating action plans to mitigate or even eliminate these impacts. Material and process efficiency is a key issue on REM, due to the chemical and energy-intensive use [22 ,31 ]. Furthermore, REEs are considered critical materials, demanding efficient use of this natural resource. The production of electricity and the burning of hard coal in power plants [31 ] are responsible for significant environmental impact, hence the use of a cleaner energy matrix in the REM production is recommended [26 ]. From the above, specific SDG targets were linked to a SWOT analysis (Table 2  ). Taking into account the design of traction motors for electric vehicles, Nordelöf et al. (2019) [20 ] suggest that synchronous reluctance machines with strontium-ferrite magnets generate less environmental impact than motors designed from either SmCo or NdFeB permanent magnets. A similar conclusion was reached by Monfared et al. (2014) [32 ] after analyzing the production of household refrigerators. However, when looking at the use phase of electric motors, Hernandez et al. (2017) [18 ] and Nordelöf et al. (2019) [28 ]agree that energy consumption represents the biggest negative impact on the environment. They also agree that the foreground process for magnet production, i.e. core processes in a magnet life cycle (from REE mining to powder metallurgy), does not pose itself as a key contributor to emissions. Magnets represent less than 2% of the total bill of material of the motor, having a small share of the environmental impact in relation to other major components (steel, copper, and aluminium). Therefore, the key to decreasing the environmental impact for electric vehicles is improving its performance and efficiency during the use phase [26 ], thus requiring less energy for each kilometer driven and reducing the overall mass of components required. These results are in line with Ozoemena et al. (2018) [72 ], who state that lower contributions to all environmental categories were observed for wind turbines with drive trains using permanent magnet generators. Besides enabling more efficient energy generation, wind turbines using permanent magnets are significantly lighter than normal turbines, therefore reducing the amount of steel required [26 ]. Additionally, high-efficiency motors decrease the impact of the use phase and thereby also significantly impacts on most impact categories [24 ,27 ]. These facts bring to light the strong points showed in Table 3  . The location of a rare earths deposit and production site plays an important role in an environmental impact study, as various parameters affecting the environmental performance of a product are location-based, such as electricity supply, transport distances, material supply, waste treatment, and environmental regulations [17 ]. Schreiber et al. (2019) [26 ] performed a comparative life cycle assessment of three commonly installed wind turbine types, observing a decrease by 20% and even by 33% in the normalized environmental impact (person equivalent) when the rare earth production takes place in Mountain Pass, USA, or Mount Weld, Australia, respectively, compared to Bayan Obo, in China. Marx et al. (2018) [22 ] agree with the statement that production at Bayan Obo has the highest impact among the three deposits, based on normalized results to person equivalent. Additionally, it has been consistently reported in the literature [17 ,19 ,23 ,31 ] that data availability is a key issue for permanent magnet production, as normally industrial data is confidential or presented in a highly aggregated format [19 ]. The majority of studies rely on the Econinvent database for their life cycle assessment. However, the existing process for magnet production in Ecoinvent does not address specific metals required for magnets used in high-temperature applications, such as heavy rare earth elements. Besides, the waste flows, emissions, infrastructure, technology, and geographical location for the estimation of the impact generated to produce rare earth metals are taken as a proxy from the Ecoinvent dataset “aluminium production, primary, liquid” [73 ], which introduces significant deviation. Therefore, according to the reviewed literature, the data in the REM supply chain is obsolete and uncertain [17 ,22 ,23 ,25 ,26 ,29 ,31 ], As shown by Wulf et al. (2017) [17 ], there is a low amount of data available to assess the sustainability of REM. There it is necessary to update the available database and make it adequate for the actual production process for permanent magnets. The use of simulation models, as introduced by Reuter et al. (2015) [62 ] is a great initiative aiming at reducing uncertainties in data collection due to data scarcity. A thermodynamic-based simulation model linked to LCA digitalizes the whole value chain for a product, guaranteeing that every material and energy flow is tracked, having a consistent life cycle inventory and system boundaries [63 ]. Also, to overcome this situation, mining companies can promote transparency by sharing data to enable statistical analysis and scientific research. This reinforces trust among companies, governments, and society [43 ]. Table 4   presents the weakness related to the lack of updated data and its relation with SDG.  3.2.2 Social impact The studies related to the Social Impacts category include a literature review [19 ], a social LCAs [17 ], a Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCsA) [17 ], and a mathematical simulation model [30 ]. In addition, Saleem (2014) [5 ] analyzed the environmental and social conflicts surrounding rare earth mining projects, as well as opportunities for improving the social and environmental performance of the sector. The social resistance for a rareearths project is inversely related to the efforts made by a producer towards a greener production system and towards achieving the SGDs and circular economy [5 ]. The social LCA studies were based on the production of REM for use in wind turbines considering the context of four different countries: Australia [29 ] and Malaysia, USA, and China [17 ,29 ]. The authors Schlör et al. (2018) [29 ] analyzed social impact according to five main categories (labor rights and decent work, health and safety, human rights, governance, community, and infrastructure) and 22 related social indicators. In turn, Wulf et al. (2017) [17 ] selected 15 impact categories. Regardless of the approaches taken, the studies converged on presenting the Chinese city Bayan Obo as the worst social performance considering the rare earth production process. Schlör et al. (2018) [29 ] indicate that the production activities of rare earth elements for renewable energy systems are associated with social risks due to the general manufacturing conditions of this industry. In the study by Jin et al. (2018b) [30 ], models were developed to design a sustainable reverse supply chain for NdFeB magnets in the USA. The authors indicated the ideal location for the processing facilities for these materials. The classification of each location occurred through the social support ranking, that is, the contribution of society to the development of this chain. Thus, social indices such as workforce, education, and business were used. Regarding health problems and working conditions, Bailey et al. (2017) [19 ] conducted a literature review considering the sustainability of REM electric vehicle engines. According to the authors, REM may induce geopolitical conflicts and cause health problems for the communities where they are extracted and processed. On the other hand, according to Bailey et al. (2017) [19 ], some rare earth machines, such as the electric and hybrid car market, are contributing to a greener economy, which represents a positive social consequence. Again, obsolete data may compromise the quality of scientific research. Among the social approaches the GaBi6 and Ecoinvent 2.2 database from 2013 [17 ] and, SHDB (Social Hotspots Database), also from 2013 [17 ,29 ]. It should be noted that these data are important to foster the discussion on how companies can improve the social aspects included in their value chains and align their corporate conformity with de SA800 social responsibility certification standard [29 ]. Three out of four analyzed papers presented the social problems in producing REM, while none of them bring practical solutions on how to solve these issues. The study conducted by Jin et al. (2018b) [30 ] addressed only the positive impacts of social aspects, from an industrial perspective, where the social attributes bring economic benefits, not addressing the social welfare. Based on the above, negative social consequences were identified as a threat (Table 5  ). 3.2.2.1 Economic considerations The four studies related to the economic considerations category include a literature review [19 ], two economic analyses [17 ,27 ], and a mathematical simulation model [30 ]. Chen and Zheng (2019) [64 ] indicated that economic research of rare earth prospered significantly between the years 2009–2018, with 92% of the studies published after the 2009 rare earth crisis. Rare earth prices are also very affected by Chinese domestic policies because the country controls more than 90% of global supply [19 ]. Thus, production activities in developed countries depend on countries such as China to provide their metal demand. In this way, the increase in publications is justified because of the severe export restrictions of REEs declared by China. It intensified the global concern with the security of supply and the volatility of prices of these elements since the global transition to a low carbon economy is taking place technologies that depend on REE [64 ]. To decrease Chinese dependence on rare earths, new REEs mining projects outside of Chinese territory have been explored. This fact boosted research on predict prices for rare earth elements [64 ]. However, according to Bailey et al. (2017) [19 ], rare earth metals, unlike conventional metals, are not traded in the stock exchange. Prices are negotiated directly between buyer and seller and details of negotiations are not publicly available, as a result, prices are high [19 ]. Wulf et al. (2017) [33 ] based their study on public corporate data. From a life cycle costing (LCC), the authors compared three different production routes: Mountain Pass; Mount Weld, and Bayan Obo. The study indicates that China only stands out when economic factors outweigh environmental and social effects since the Chinese market dominates REE exports. Several factors contribute to the mineral supply risk, such as “a high concentration of production in countries with poor governance, limited material substitutability, and poor end-of-life recycling rates” [65 ]. Therefore, the supply risk of rare earths has become a relevant issue. Lovik et al. (2018) highlighted the significant budgets for European projects that study the recycling processes of REEs and the replacement and efficiency of rare earth elements in permanent magnets. Rare earth recovery costs have been the subject of studies of Jin et al. (2018b) [30 ] and Amato et al. (2019) [27 ]. According to Amato et al. (2019) [27 ], metal recovery requires complex decommissioning operations. About 80% of the investment for REM recovery comes from working capital costs, such as raw materials, labor, and waste treatment and disposal. Jin et al. (2018b) [30 ] show that the NdFeB magnet recovery process incurs costs as: end-of-life product acquisition costs, operating and transportation costs, and installation costs. Amato et al. (2019) [18 ] indicate that there are potential economic opportunities in the metal recovery, however, highly sustainable recycling methodologies are needed. According to the authors, the main financial benefits for the recycling process is obtained by recovering neodymium and praseodymium [27 ]. To maximize the economic benefits of the NdFeB magnet recycling chain, an infrastructure should be designed by identifying optimal locations for processing facilities and defining optimal capacities and transportation flows [30 ]. In the study conducted by Jin et al. (2018b) [30 ], models were developed to design a sustainable reverse supply chain for NdFeB magnets in the USA. The authors indicated the ideal locations for the processing facilities for these materials considering the nearness to EOL supply and magnet demand and the low tax states. In addition, Lovik et al. (2018) [65 ] believe that there is no such difference in their economic risk (or criticality) compared to other metals. This thought is in line with that presented in the study by Bradshaw et al. (2013) [66 ] and Erdmann & Graedel (2011) [67 ]. The authors indicate that criticality is a dynamic property and not an inherent property of a specific material. The scarcity of a material occurs when its availability is limited or decreased (geochemical scarcity) and the costs of mining, in terms of energy, water, and environmental damage, are so high that they do not favor mining activity [66 ]. Thus, scarcity should only be estimated by economic aspects, considering the increase in the price of minerals corrected for inflation [66 ]. In short, advanced prospecting methods, improvements in extraction technology, social and political changes, and financial cycles can contribute to the availability of minerals [66 ,67 ]. REM are essential components in high technological electrical equipment [4 ] and the Chinese monopolistic supply of REE generates a great supply uncertainty [30 ], which is considered a threat. Meanwhile, the production of REM brings the benefit of economic growth (Table 6  ).   3.2.3 Circular economy This section brings together all analyzed papers that address practices of circular economy, that differently to the current linear economy, is a system where economic growth is not directly connected with resources use, the main idea is reducing and recirculating of natural resources [68 ]. All the 27 checked papers categorized as Circular Economy focus on recycling, reverse supply chain, REE obtention from alternative deposits, and greener metallurgy, each of them bringing different perspectives and contributions. The solutions presented in these articles are considered key sustainability aspects, once they can minimize REE impacts by providing secondary resources or obtaining virgin REE in a greener way. A total of eight papers presented biotechnological routes for obtaining REE [40–42 ,44 ,46 ,49 ,53 ,54 ]. One of the addressed techniques is the bioleaching, that means, the utilization of organic acids, produced by bacteria and fungi, for REE separation, instead of traditional methods with sulfuric acid [46 ,54 ]. Bioleaching was investigated to be applied to REE recovery from secondary sources or even to separate REE elements from primary mining, but, according to Ylias et al. (2017) [46 ] this thecnique is more promising applied in primary ores. Despite the promising findings, further studies are required to reach scale applications [4 ]. Another bio-solution presented in the reviewed paper is the biosorption process, meaning the use of fungi, algae, bacteria, or activated carbon to REE reclamation [40–42 ]. The recovery of REE from unconventional deposits as wastewater, industrial effluents, metallurgical slags, tailings, coal fly ash, fossil fuel burning wastes is also explored in the portfolio of papers [42 ,45 ]. Kafeni et al. (2017) [47 ] and Naidu et al. (2019) [56 ] explored the potential of REE reclamation from acid mine drainage (AMD), which is an environmental pollutant generated by the oxidation of sulfide minerals when exposed to the environment. REE are presented in the AMD, and studies show that it can be a possible alternative source for these elements, however, there is still a lack of viable technologies for their scale application. The authors Sahoo et al. (2016) [45 ] collected information on obtaining REE from coal fly ash and, Ujaczki et al. (2018) [51 ] discuss the possibility of REE recovery from Bauxite residues. Besides avoiding the natural resources extraction, these strategies give a solution to waste that otherwise could pollute the environment [42 ]. Another commonly explored CE practice is urban mining [52 ,53 ]. Data concerning the availability of end-of-life materials outflows are presented by Busch et al. (2017) [34 ], Ciacci et al. (2019) [39 ], and Fishman and Graedel (2019) [37 ]. These authors applied simulation methods, as the analysis of material flow and input-output modeling, using dynamic model, considering demand and lifespan of wind generators [34 ,37 ,39 ], vehicles [39 ], 34], e-bikes, air conditioners, washing and drying machines, refrigerators, voice coil motors, magnetic resonance imaging scans, and acoustic transducers [19 ]. The focus of these simulation studies was to understand the REM demand [37 ] and predict the future production of neodymium and dysprosium from secondary resources [34 ,37 ,39 ]. Jin et al. (2018b) [30 ] bring the relevance of recycling and present the lack of knowledge on how to manage the reverse supply chain of REM. Therefore, they designed mathematical equations to find solutions concerning facility locations, sizing, and shipment fluxes of used magnets. According to the authors, the developed models can help the industry design the reverse supply network for a circular economy. REMs are applied in several types of equipment hence, Habib (2019) [38 ] identified the need for grouping products according to the degree of economic and technical feasibility of resource recovery. This product classification enables characterizing the urban mines of NdFeB magnet and helps better understand the circularity potential of REM. Bigger products, such as REM from wind generators, allow magnet reuse opportunities. In contrast to this, products such as computer components, smartphones, and household appliances are more feasible for recycling due to the already established electronic waste handling system. Papers that seek greener solution in the REE production are also part of the portfolio. These solutions comprise insigths regarding sustainable hidrometallurgyc techniques [43 ], recently developed thecnologies that can minimize the use of energy and chemical products during REE extraction and separation [48 ,50 ,55 ]. Also, the authors Omodara et al. (2019) [57 ] suggest the possibility of REE substitutions for non-critical elements. Besides that, three review articles complete the portfolio of papers on Circular Economy, all of them have examined the pros and cons of different recycling and recovery techniques [33 ,35 ,36 ]. The significant potential for end-of-life recycling enables production from secondary raw materials and helps recover the embodied energy in used materials [34 ,36 ]. The significant content of REEs, makes the REM a potential resource of secondary raw materials, reducing the economic cost up to 70 times [27 ]. If well managed, roughly up to 50% of the annual neodymium demand in the EU could be met by domestic secondary supply at current levels [19 ]. Energy savings and GHG emissions reduction are associated with neodymium recycling [19 ]. The comparison of recycling routes with primary production shows that the recycling process has the potential for lower process-specific impacts when compared with the current rare earth primary production route [21 ]. Through magnet-to-magnet recycling is possible to decrease from 64 to 96% of environmental impacts in specific impact categories [26 ]. In the next few years, there will be an increase of available material for recycling [36 ]. However, currently there is no stable industrial structurere regarding REM recycling technologies [36 ] and a lack of dedicated legislation for recycling and resource-efficient design [19 ], as the recovery of NdFeB magnets incurs complex dismantling operations [27 ]. One of the most critical challenge is collecting equipments tha cointais REE [36 ]. Besides that, waste directives already exist in UE for waste electrical and electronic equipment but failed to promote the recovery of elements and materials contained in relatively small amounts per unit of product, such as Neodymium [19 ]. In order to be viable, future recycling schemes must be profitable. Thus, secondary production must be as competitive as primary production [19 ,36 ]. Also, reverse logistics questions must be further investigated [30 ]. Circular economy practices in the REM supply chain, as reusing and recycling of materials and components [26 ,28 ], 34], and product design to make recycling easier are mentioned in the reviewed literature [28 ], as well as the need to implement regulations mandating the reuse of magnetic materials [32 ]. There is a need to explore all the benefits of CE in the REM supply chain, as new business models. Nowadays, the CE in REM is limited, for example, according to Binnemans et al. (2013) [33 ] REM reuse is only applicable for large easily accessible magnets, like wind turbines, large electric motors, and generators in hybrid and electric vehicles, but are not available in large quantities in scrap today. Based on the possible techniques exposed and knowing that obtaining REE is critical for the REM production sustainability, the strengths and opportunities presented in Table 7   were identified. From the above, it is possible to realize that at some points the production of REM can slow down the achievement of the SDGs if no actions are taken. On the other hand, if proactive measures are taken, this productive sector can significantly contribute to reaching these global goals. The SWOT analysis results are summirezed in Table 8  .    4 Conclusions Rare Earth Magnets (REM), especially the NdFeB, are essential components in high-efficiency electric motors and wind turbines, but the sustainability of its production has not been discussed thoroughly and the literature about this topic is fragmented. This paper fills this research gap via a systematic literature review and SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats). The findings of this research can contribute to future researchers, as long as it clarifies the current situation of sustainability in REM production. The results indicate four main research subjects of studies: environmental impacts; social impacts; economic aspects and Circular Economy. Environmental impacts of REM have been investigated to a very detailed level, 15 evaluated studies focus on weighting environmental impacts, which mainly occur due to the chemicals and energy consumption during the production process. The theme of social aspect was most evaluated in terms of negative impacts. Economic aspects mainly focus on comparing the financial benefits of recycling and, the theme of circular economy has started getting more attention, and explores solutions that contribute to minimizing REE extraction and production impacts. The SWOT analysis demonstrated that REM-sustainability strengths afford the achievement of SDG targets, contributing to a greener economy, linked with SDG 07 and SDG13; and present a great potential for end-of-life recycling, related to SDG 11. Also, the potential for Circular Economy implementation, associated with SDG 12 was recognized as a great opportunity for further investigation. On the other hand, the identified weaknesses and threats can challenge some SDGs: the need for material and process efficiency, and the negative environmental consequences affect SDG 15; the lack of updated data slow down SDG 17, the social consequences go against SDG 03 and SDG 08, and REE supply risks and uncertainty can compromise the achievement of SDG 09. From the 17 SDGs stated by the UN, REMs are contributing strongly with four of them, identified as strengths and opportunities. Other SDGs, identified as weaknesses and threats, can be better investigated in further studies. Eigth SDGs are not yet directly covered by the researches: “SDG 01-No Poverty  “, “SDG 02-Zero Hunger ”, “SDG 04-Quality Education” , “SDG 05-Gender Equality ”, “SDG 06- Clean Water, and Sanitation ”, “SDG 10-Reduced Inequalities ”, “SDG 14-Life Below Water ” and “SDG 16-Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions ”, indicating the need for further exploration of the sustainability theme in REM production. One of the biggest challenges in REM-sustainability studies is the difficulty in obtaining updated and reliable data, once the main REM production occurs only in China. Sustainability is a theme that has been widely explored in recent years, but its adoption in emerging supply chains, as is the case of REM is still recent and has many unknowns. From this literature review, the recommendations for further investigation cover studies to improve legislation for circular economy; explore other circular economy aspects as business models, product design and urban mining; make recycling process profitable; improve social conditions; develop process efficiency; share data reliability and; achieve SDGs that are not yet covered. The results of this research may be used as a reference to support the theoretical basis of REMs and sustainability.
