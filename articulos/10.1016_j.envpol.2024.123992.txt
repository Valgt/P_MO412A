                  Achieving the United nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) remains a significant challenge, necessitating urgent and prioritized strategies. Among the various challenges, air pollution continues to pose one of the most substantial threats to the SDGs due to its widespread adverse effects on human health and ecosystems. However, the connections between air pollution and the SDGs have often been overlooked. This study reveals that out of the 169 SDG targets, 71 are adversely impacted by air pollution, while only 6 show potential positive effects. In China, two major atmospheric nitrogen pollutants, ammonia and nitrogen oxides, resulted in an economic loss of 400 billion United States Dollar (USD) in 2020, which could be reduced by 33% and 34% by 2030, respectively. It would enhance the progress towards SDGs in China by 14%, directly contributing to the achievement of SDGs 1 to 6 and 11 to 15. This improvement is estimated to yield overall benefits totaling 119 billion USD, exceeded the total implementation cost of 82 billion USD with ammonia as the preferential mitigation target. This study underscores the importance of robust scientific evidence in integrated policies aimed at aligning improvements in environmental quality with the priorities of sustainable development.

The impacts of air pollution on the 169 targets are categorized into 6 levels based on the degree of influence: “Low”, “Moderate”, and “High”. For negative impacts, “Low” means mild indirect effects on social/administrative targets; “Moderate” means air pollution is a contributing factor but not decisive; “High” means severe direct impacts on environment/health targets. For positive impacts, “Low” means mild indirect effects on social/administrative targets; “Moderate” means air pollutants help maintain target resilience; “High” means air pollutants expedite target achievement. Each box in the figure represents a target of the 169 targets. Different colors and shades indicate negative/positive impacts and their degrees, while gray indicates no literature evidence proving a connection between air pollution and the target.

College of Environmental and Resource Sciences Zhejiang University Hangzhou 310058 China       Achieving the United nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) remains a significant challenge, necessitating urgent and prioritized strategies. Among the various challenges, air pollution continues to pose one of the most substantial threats to the SDGs due to its widespread adverse effects on human health and ecosystems. However, the connections between air pollution and the SDGs have often been overlooked. This study reveals that out of the 169 SDG targets, 71 are adversely impacted by air pollution, while only 6 show potential positive effects. In China, two major atmospheric nitrogen pollutants, ammonia and nitrogen oxides, resulted in an economic loss of 400 billion United States Dollar (USD) in 2020, which could be reduced by 33% and 34% by 2030, respectively. It would enhance the progress towards SDGs in China by 14%, directly contributing to the achievement of SDGs 1 to 6 and 11 to 15. This improvement is estimated to yield overall benefits totaling 119 billion USD, exceeded the total implementation cost of 82 billion USD with ammonia as the preferential mitigation target. This study underscores the importance of robust scientific evidence in integrated policies aimed at aligning improvements in environmental quality with the priorities of sustainable development.

The SDGs represent a global effort to end poverty, protect the environment, and promote prosperity and peace. With 17 goals and 169 targets, they address challenges like poverty, inequality, climate change, and justice. Each target aims to provide clear steps toward its respective goal, ranging from reducing emissions to promoting fair education access. The targets' interconnected nature underscores the complexities of these global issues and the necessity for collaborative efforts across sectors to realize these ambitious aims. As the 2030 deadline approaches, the pursuit of SDGs faces notable challenges, especially in less developed countries grappling with environmental pressures (Hermwille et al., 2023 ). Air pollution, a significant threat to human health, causes over 6 million premature deaths yearly (Zeng et al., 2019 ; Yin et al., 2020 ). Harmful airborne substances, such as particulate matters (PMs) and ozone (O3 ), contribute to respiratory diseases (Yang et al., 2020 ), cardiovascular problems (Mannucci et al., 2019 ), and ecological harm (Zeng et al., 2019 ). It directly affects two SDG targets focused on health and cities (target 3.9 and target 11.6) and indirectly impacts agriculture, food security (Tai et al., 2014 ) and ecological health (Payne et al., 2017a ). Thus, effectively tackling air pollution is critical for advancing global sustainable development. Although China has seen progress in tackling air pollution, challenges persist, primarily due to sulfur dioxide (SO2 ), nitrogen oxides (NOx ), and ammonia (NH3 ) emissions. The government's efforts have significantly reduced SO2  and NOx  emissions since the late 1990s and early 2010s, respectively, but NH3  has been less addressed until more recently. With SO2  levels decreasing, the focus is now on nitrogen emissions, emphasizing the need for cost-effective nitrogen pollution control to improve air quality and aid SDG progress. While studies explore air pollutants' impacts on SDGs (Zhao et al., 2020 ; Zhu et al., 2022a ), comprehensive research on NOx  and NH3 's effects across all SDGs is lacking, leaving their complex interactions with SDG targets poorly understood. Understanding the complex links between NOx , NH3 , and the SDGs is crucial for reducing negative effects and maximizing positive outcomes. This study assesses how NH3  and NOx  emissions impact all 169 targets of the 17 SDGs in China, using modeling and cost-benefit analysis to evaluate how improving air quality can help achieve sustainable development. The results show the intricate ways air pollution interacts with the SDGs, providing strong scientific support for comprehensive pollution control policies. It highlights the substantial benefits of reducing NH3  and NOx  emissions for health, ecosystems, and society, emphasizing the importance of tackling these pollutants to fulfill the SDGs' comprehensive goals.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Emission data sources and calculation The NH3  emission data for the provinces in this study were calculated using the Coupled Human and Natural Systems (CHANS) model in 2020 (Gu et al., 2015 ), while the NOx  emission data were obtained from the China Environmental Statistical Yearbook (http://www.stats.gov.cn/ ).  2.2 Systematic literature review We conducted a systematic literature review and incorporated expert judgment to assess the impact of air pollution on the 169 targets of the 17 SDGs. We meticulously defined our search criteria to include keywords related to “air pollution” and each of the SDG targets, ensuring a thorough coverage of the relevant literature. Databases such as Web of Science were searched, with the timeframe of publications set from January 2000 to December 2023. The inclusion criteria for studies were those that directly addressed the impact of air pollution on the SDG targets, with exclusion criteria set for studies lacking empirical data. Following the initial search, titles and abstracts were screened by two independent reviewers to identify potentially relevant studies. Full texts of these studies were then assessed for eligibility, with discrepancies resolved through discussion or, if necessary, consultation with a third reviewer. Additionally, we incorporated expert judgment to complement the findings from the literature review. Our research focused on determining whether air pollution has a positive or negative effect on achieving these targets. We categorized the impact into three tiers: high, moderate, and low. Targets classified as “high” indicate that air pollution has a significant direct effect on the environment or human health; targets classified as “moderate” suggest that air pollution is one of the factors that affect the target, but not the decisive one; targets classified as “low” suggest that air pollution has an indirect effect on targets related to social interventions or administrative purposes. A detailed list of references for the systematic literature review can be found in Table S1 .  2.3 Economic losses caused by NH3  and NOx  This study dissects the economic damages inflicted by NH3  and NOx  into 6 categories (human health, crops, forests, grasslands, buildings, and climate) to comprehensively explore the impact of pollutants on environmental health and human development (see Table S2 ). The economic loss for each category is calculated by multiplying the unit economic loss caused by NH3  or NOx  by their emissions. The unit economic loss caused by NH3  or NOx  in China in 2020 is primarily derived from the online Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) model (https://gains.iiasa.ac.at/models/index.html ). The economic losses for all 31 provinces are reasonably determined by factoring in various coefficients, including fine particulate matter (PM2.5 , particles with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 μm) concentration, nitrogen deposition intensity, value of a statistical life (VSL), willingness to pay (WTP), average housing prices, and carbon prices. Klimont et al. have provided a detailed description of the GAINS module (Klimont and Winiwarter, 2015 ). All monetary values in this study are adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP) and measured in 2020 United States Dollar (USD). The economic losses (E L   ) caused by NH3  and NOx  of sector j in province i is calculated as:(1) E L  N H  3  , i , j   = U C  N H  3  , i , j   × E N H  3  , i , j       (2) E L  N O  x  , i , j   = U C  N O  x  , i , j   × E N O  x  , i , j       where U C  N H  3     , U C  N O  x      represent unit economic losses caused by NH3  and NOx ; E N H  3     , E N O  x      denote NH3  and NOx  emissions in province i.  2.4 Mitigation potentials of NH3  and NOx  in 2030 The assessment of mitigation potential in this study is based on the mitigation efficiency of 31 provinces obtained from a meta-analysis of China (see Table S3 ). By integrating the results of meta-analysis, the mitigation measures and implementation rates were incorporated into the GAINS model to simulate pollutant emissions in China towards 2030. The mitigation potential was then evaluated by comparing it to 2020 levels. As each province has varying levels of economic and technological development, the measures implemented may differ. The reduction of NH3  and NOx  emissions (Δ E   ) in province i  in 2030 is calculated as:(3) Δ E N H  3  , i , k   = A N H  3  , i , k   × [ E F  N H  3  , i , k   × η N H  3  , i , k   × X N H  3  , i , k    ]      (4) Δ E N O  x  , i , k   = A N O  x  , i , k   × [ E F  N O  x  , i , k   × η N O  x  , i , k   × X N O  x  , i , k    ]      where k represents a specific reduction measure or a combination of multiple measures; A    is the activity data of the pollution source; E F    represents the corresponding uncontrolled emission factor; η    is the specific mitigation efficacy; X    represents the implementation rate of reduction technique or option k, and the baseline is zero, meaning that no abatement measures have been implemented. Furthermore, for measures that do not interact with each other, the mitigation potentials can be cumulated; for measures that interact, their mitigation abilities can be combined to estimate their comprehensive mitigation potential.  2.5 Cost-benefit analysis The cost-benefit analysis in this study is based on the changes in atmospheric nitrogen emissions resulting from various reduction measures in China. The cost of alleviating NH3  and NOx  nationwide is defined as the direct expenditure (including investment and operational costs) required to implement these measures, which is the sum of the expenditures of the 7 sectors (see Table S4 ). The cost assessment database and methodology used in this study primarily draw on the GAINS model (Klimont and Winiwarter, 2015 ). This model considers and balances regional economic scale and technical conditions of China, as well as equipment operation, maintenance, and social management, hence it can accurately estimate the cost of mitigation. More detailed description of the GAINS model and cost calculation can be referenced in Klimont and Winiwarter (2015) . The implementation cost (I C   ) of NH3  and NOx  in province i  in 2030 is calculated as:(5) I C  N H  3  , i , k   = Δ E N H  3  , i , k   × U C  N H  3  , i , k       (6) I C  N O  x  , i , k   = Δ E N O  x  , i , k   × U C  N O  x  , i , k       where k represents a specific measure or a combination of measures for pollution reduction; Δ E    is the change in nitrogen pollutant emissions calculated in equations (3) and (4) ; U C    is the unit abatement cost of the most appropriate set of mitigation measures that reduce nitrogen pollutant emissions in province i, which is derived from the online GAINS model database and adjusted based on the specific conditions of each province. The social benefits (S O C  b e n e f i t     ) of NH3  and NOx  mitigation presented in this study are defined as the sum of avoided damage costs due to premature mortality caused by air pollution (H H  b e n e f i t     ), ecosystem health benefit (E H  b e n e f i t     ), and climate change mitigation benefit (C C  b e n e f i t     ), which can be calculated as follows:(7) S O C  b e n e f i t , i , k   = H H  b e n e f i t , i , k   + E H  b e n e f i t , i , k   + C C  b e n e f i t , i , k        The human health benefits, calculated based on the VSL (Yin et al., 2021 ), refer to the advantages of reducing atmospheric nitrogen pollution and alleviating PM2.5 , which can prevent premature mortality and associated health-related expenses. These benefits include direct medical costs such as treatment and hospitalization, as well as indirect costs like healthcare expenditure, productivity losses due to missed work hours, and broader societal impacts on labor (Gu et al., 2021 ). We obtained the unit health damage costs of NH3  and NOx  emissions in China by using the method of Gu et al. (2021) , which associated population density, per capita GDP, and regional urbanization rate to calculate economic cost of mortality per unit of nitrogen emission. To mitigate the synergistic effects of NH3  and NOx , especially their roles in the formation of secondary inhalable particles, Gu et al. used the GEOS-Chem atmospheric model (Shao et al., 2019 ) to simulate the contributions of NH3  and NOx , and total reactive nitrogen emissions to the formation of PM2.5  and O3 , as well as health risks. When assessing overall effects, the combined effects of both have been considered, reducing the overestimation of health risks during estimation. The health benefits (H H  b e n e f i t     ) for province i were calculated as follows:(8) H H  b e n e f i t , i , k   = ∑ j  Δ E i , j , k   × U H H  c o s t , i , j       where j represents atmospheric nitrogen pollutants (NH3  and NOx ); Δ E    is the emission reduction of nitrogen pollutants calculated from equations (3) and (4) ; U H H    represents the unit human health damage cost of atmospheric nitrogen pollutant emissions. The values can be found in Table S6 . Since there is no research on the damage costs of nitrogen pollutants to ecosystems in China, we used studies from the US and the EU to evaluate the damage costs of ecosystems in 31 provinces in China (Benayas et al., 2009 ; Compton et al., 2011 ; Sutton et al., 2011 ; Jones et al., 2014 ; Sobota et al., 2015 ; van Grinsven et al., 2018 ; Ohashi et al., 2019 ; Leclère et al., 2020 ), adjusted by differences in WTP and PPP in each province. The ecosystem health benefit (E H  b e n e f i t     ) for province i were calculated as follows:(9) E H  b e n e f i t , i , k   = ∑ j  Δ E i , j , k   × δ U S , j   × W T P  i  W T P  U S    × P G D P  i  P G D P  U S        where j represents different atmospheric nitrogen pollutants (NH3  and NOx ); Δ E    is the emission reduction of nitrogen pollutants calculated from equations (3) and (4) ; W T P  i    , W T P  U S      represent the estimated unit cost of ecosystem damage caused by nitrogen emissions in province i and the US in the 2000s (Sutton et al., 2011 ; Sobota et al., 2015 ); P G D P  i     and P G D P  U S      are the per capita gross domestic product of province i and the US (in constant 2020 USD). The values of WTP and PPP for each province can be found in Table S7  and Table S8 . To calculate the monetized benefits of climate change mitigation in different provinces, we multiplied the reduction in NH3  and NOx  emissions by the unit cost of climate change mitigation. The benefits of climate change mitigation (C C  b e n e f i t     ) for province i were calculated as follows:(10) C C  b e n e f i t , i , k   = ∑ j  Δ E i , j , k   × U C C  c o s t , i , j       where j represents different atmospheric nitrogen pollutants (NH3  and NOx ); Δ E    is the emission reduction of nitrogen pollutants calculated from equations (3) and (4) ; U C C    represents the unit climate change mitigation cost of atmospheric nitrogen pollutant emissions. It should be noted that NH3  and NOx  emissions can form aerosols that have a cooling effect on the global climate (Pinder et al., 2013 ). The unit costs can be found in Table S5 .  2.6 SDG index score calculation To select appropriate indicators for analysis, we reviewed several sources of information, including the official list of global SDG indicators published by the UN (Verma and Petersen, 2018 ). We also created additional indicator systems based on our understanding of the SDGs (see Table S9 ). Then we normalized the provincial data arrays for each SDG indicator in China (see Table S10 ). The detailed methods refer to the SDG Index and Dashboards Report 2018 (Sachs et al., 2018 ). Each SDG score (x ′    ) was calculated as follows:(11) Positive : x ′  = 100 × x − x min   x max  − x min        (12) Negative : x ′  = 100 × x max  − x  x max  − x min        where x    represents the raw data value; x max     and x min     represents the upper and lower boundaries. Specifically, we incorporated adjusted values into the scoring framework to calculate the SDG index scores after emission abatement, ensuring that any scores exceeding the maximum threshold of 100 were capped at this limit. This adjustment was crucial for maintaining a uniform scale and allowed for a direct comparison with the baseline scores established in 2020, ensuring that all provincial scores are consistently measured within the framework's boundaries. This approach allowed us to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of mitigating NH3  and NOx  emissions to the achievement of SDGs in China. The SDG index score at the national level was calculated using an arithmetic mean approach, following the methodology outlined in the SDG Index and Dashboards Report 2018 (Sachs et al., 2018 ). This method assigns equal weights to all SDGs, emphasizing the importance of integrated solutions that address all 17 SDGs equally (Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017 ; Xu et al., 2020a ). It reflects the idea that all countries should strive to achieve all 17 SDGs through holistic and balanced strategies.   3 Results and discussion 3.1 Impacts of air pollution on SDGs Our structured literature review has unveiled numerous interactions between air pollution and the 17 SDGs, directly or indirectly affecting 46% (77) of the 169 SDG targets (Fig. 1  ). These associations predominantly lean towards the negative side, with air pollution impeding progress on 71 targets spread across all 17 SDGs. In contrast, only six targets indicate potential positive impacts from specific air pollutants. This stark imbalance underscores the urgent need to address air quality degradation as a critical barrier to achieving the 2030 Agenda. The extensive linkages identified by our analysis emphasize the necessity of integrated pollution control strategies to align improvements in environmental quality with the overarching vision of the SDGs. In terms of direct impacts, air pollution poses significant threats to human development (SDG 3) and ecological equilibrium (SDGs 6, 13–15). PMs and their precursors constitute major components of air pollutants with severe adverse effects on human health, particularly among vulnerable groups such as pregnant women and children, leading to conditions like pregnancy-related hypertension (Nobles et al., 2019 ), cardiovascular diseases (de Bont et al., 2022 ), and respiratory ailments (Yang et al., 2020 ). There is growing evidence (Turner et al., 2020 ) that air pollution is associated with an increased risk of various cancers, and the carcinogenic potential of specific air pollutants has been highlighted. Studies indicate that exposure to polluted air, especially PMs and industrial air pollutants, is associated with a higher incidence of lung cancer (Hill et al., 2023 ), breast cancer (Gabet et al., 2021 ), and bladder cancer (Chen et al., 2022 ), underscoring the critical need for comprehensive pollution control strategies to mitigate these risks. In 2020, human activities in China resulted in 17.2 terrogram (Tg) of nitrogen emissions and 11.4 Tg of nitrogen deposition, causing problems like eutrophication (Kim et al., 2011 ), harmful algal blooms (Chen et al., 2019 ), and the deterioration of drinking water quality (affecting Targets 6.1 and 6.3) (Yu et al., 2019 ). Atmospheric nitrogen pollution not only directly damages ecosystems but also indirectly undermines multiple SDGs. It exacerbates health-related expenses, driving a cycle of poverty and environmental degradation that worsens income inequality and hinders efforts to eradicate poverty (Targets 1.1–1.2). Pollutants like carbon monoxide and PMs are linked to decreased happiness, higher mental disorder rates, increased traffic accidents, drug abuse (Targets 3.5–3.7) (Szyszkowicz et al., 2018 ; Wan et al., 2020 ), and violence, including suicide (Targets 16.1–16.2) (Wu et al., 2021 ). Indoor air pollution, particularly in classrooms, negatively affects students' health, reducing enrollment and academic performance (Targets 4.1–4.3) (Chen et al., 2018 ; Zhu et al., 2021 ). Furthermore, the emission of acidic pollutants accelerates infrastructure corrosion, threatening the sustainability and resilience of buildings and infrastructure (Target 9.1) (Kumar and Imam, 2013 ). Our systematic review finds that some air pollutants, contrary to their mostly detrimental effects, can benefit specific ecological and climate-related SDGs 13–15 (Hungate et al., 2003 ; Ravindra et al., 2019 ). Notably, inorganic nitrogen deposition acts as a nutrient in marine ecosystems, boosting phytoplankton growth and overall marine productivity (Target 14.2) (Seok et al., 2021 ), and enhances soil nutrients in terrestrial ecosystems, stimulating nitrogen-limited systems, and increasing soil enzyme activity in fragile ecosystems with low soil microbial activity (Meunier et al., 2016 ; Dong et al., 2019 ), which supports plant growth and forest sustainability (Targets 15.1–15.4) (Reay et al., 2008 ). Moreover, NH3  and NOx  emissions contribute to climate change mitigation by participating in atmospheric chemical reactions that produce aerosols (Chen et al., 2020 ; Qi et al., 2020 ). These aerosols have a cooling effect on the Earth by absorbing and scattering solar radiation, known as the aerosol direct effect (Allen et al., 2019 ).  3.2 SDGs interactions with NH3  and NOx  emissions Fig. 2   illustrates the interrelationships between NH3 , NOx , and the SDGs, which can be broadly categorized into driving factors and pollution impacts, encompassing both direct and indirect relationships. Given that SDG 10 emphasizes reducing inequality within and between countries, SDG 16 promotes creating a peaceful and inclusive society, and SDG 17 focuses on sustainable development through global partnerships, the relevance of the driving factors or impacts between NH3  and NOx  is relatively low. Consequently, these aspects are not discussed in detail. Key SDG targets focus on energy production, economic growth, industry, transportation, and consumption (SDGs 7–9 and 11–12). Target 7.1 aims to achieve affordable and reliable modern energy by 2030, especially in developing countries, through initiatives such as increasing power plants, which may lead to increased air pollution (Tang et al., 2020 ). SDG 8's push for employment and growth (Targets 8.1–8.3) could boost NH3  and NOx  emissions from more agriculture and industry activities (Jiang et al., 2022 ). Similarly, enhancing infrastructure and the industrial GDP share (Targets 9.1–9.2) could raise NOx  emissions (Chen and Chen, 2021 ). Also, improvements in housing and transportation targeted in SDG 11, and industrial development in developing countries aimed at in Target 12.1, may increase pollutant emissions. However, these drivers also hint at solutions like renewable energy, cleaner industry practices, sustainable transport, and consumption behaviors. Specific targets linked to these factors aim to reduce air pollution. SDG 7 highlights boosting energy efficiency and clean energy to cut energy production pollution (Gao et al., 2021 ). Enhancing sustainable industrial production and innovation (Targets 8.2, 9.4–9.5) could lower emissions (Yuan et al., 2022 ). Sustainable transport and construction (Target 11.3) (Nieuwenhuijsen, 2021 ), plus cutting waste (Targets 12.3–12.5) (Yousefloo and Babazadeh, 2020 ), and promoting sustainable lifestyles can lessen pollution, improving life quality. This shows the importance of a comprehensive strategy to tackle air pollution while meeting these targets. The impacts of NH3  and NOx  on the SDGs include environmental harm (SDGs 1, 2, and 15), health (SDGs 3–5), buildings (SDG 11), resource use efficiency (SDG 12), climate change (SDG 13), and aquatic ecosystems (SDGs 6 and 14). In 2020, China's economic losses from these emissions, considering factors like crop yield, biodiversity, human health, building damage, and climate impact, amounted to 400 billion USD (Fig. 3  ). The largest share of this loss was health-related, costing 188 billion USD (47%), while grassland ecosystems suffered substantially as well, with 125 billion USD (31%) in losses. High levels of these pollutants are linked to respiratory and chronic diseases (Wyer et al., 2022 ) and their reaction with other air pollutants forms PMs and O3  (Huang et al., 2021 ; Lin et al., 2021 ), posing risks to cardiovascular health and increasing the likelihood of severe illnesses (Murray et al., 2020 ; Wang et al., 2020a ). These emissions also lead to soil acidification (Chen et al., 2023 ), harming plant life and biodiversity (Ke et al., 2023 ), thus impacting food security and ecological balance (Zhang et al., 2021 ). Soil acidification from NH3  and NOx  also disrupts soil microorganisms and plants (Janssens et al., 2010 ), affecting the food chain and ecological balance (Payne et al., 2017b ). Additionally, they react with atmospheric oxygen, contributing to the corrosion of buildings, affecting urban development and infrastructure resilience (Xiao et al., 2022 ). This analysis highlights that although there are no specific targets directly related to NH3  and NOx  pollution, these pollutants are broadly associated with nearly all 17 SDGs (Fig. S1 ), encompassing driving factors, impacts, and potential solutions. Consequently, the implementation of comprehensive abatement measures is crucial to simultaneously advance progress across all 17 SDGs, thereby avoiding trade-offs where achieving some goals comes at the expense of others.  3.3 NH3  and NOx  mitigation potentials Addressing the detrimental impact of NH3  and NOx  emissions on achieving the SDGs, our study delves into the potential for reducing these emissions to further the SDG goals. Our comprehensive review identified key measures across seven sectors: (1) Power: Incorporating fuel balancing, switching, and emission control technologies. (2) Industry: Technological advancements in sectors like steel and construction. (3) Transportation: Enhancing emission controls in diesel engines and off-road machinery. (4) Households: Promoting high-efficiency air purifiers and cleaner stoves. (5) Waste: Improving combustion and treatment processes. (6) Agriculture: Optimizing fertilizer use and livestock management. (7) Other: Reducing biomass burning emissions. Due to the distinct sources, chemical behaviors, and roles in atmospheric chemistry and ecosystem health, NH3  and NOx  each play substantial roles, with relatively independent correlation. Despite these differences, they interact in the atmosphere, leading to synergistic effects. The correlation between NH3  and NOx  is particularly evident in the formation of secondary particles. For instance, NH3  reacts with acidic gases (such as nitric acid) to form ammonium nitrate, a product of NOx  oxidation (Su et al., 2020 ). NOx  participates in photochemical reactions, forming O3  under the influence of volatile organic compounds and sunlight (Bao et al., 2021 ). While NH3  does not directly contribute to O3  formation, its role in particle formation influences the process. Understanding the interaction between NH3  and NOx  is crucial for effective air quality management. Reducing emissions of one compound without considering the other may not yield the expected improvements, shifting environmental burdens. Therefore, considering comprehensive strategies for NH3  and NOx  is essential for addressing their combined impacts on air pollution and public health. Our model simulations indicate that with technological advancements, the combination of these measures can effectively reduce NH3  and NOx  emissions by 33% and 34%, respectively, in China at its current activity level. The potential for mitigating NH3  and NOx  is expected to increase annually with the deep implementation of these mitigation options, reaching a total reduction of 3.9 Tg for NH3  and 3.5 Tg for NOx  by 2030 (Fig. S2 ). Among all NH3  reduction measures, biomass combustion reduction and power plant emission reduction exhibit the most significant performance, achieving emission reductions exceeding 60% (Fig. 4  b). Similarly, for NOx , controlling biomass combustion and power plant emissions also result in substantial reductions, followed by upgrading waste treatment processes, which can achieve reductions as high as 48%. Notably, the household sector is projected to contribute to increased NH3  emissions by 72% and a slight increase of 1% in NOx  emissions due to factors such as population growth, increased indoor living frequency and duration (Shen et al., 2021 ), and the use of gas stoves, septic tanks, and flushing toilets (Li et al., 2016 ; Zhu et al., 2022b ). Further analysis of the mitigation measures for the 31 provinces in China reveals that provinces with higher and moderate per capita GDP (PGDP) generally have larger mitigation potentials compared to provinces with lower PGDP. Some provinces exhibit disparities between NH3  and NOx  mitigation potential. For instance, provinces like Guangdong, Shanghai, and Tianjin have NOx  abatement potential exceeding NH3  abatement potential by 10–20%, primarily due to the dominance of industrial and tertiary sectors that generate higher levels of NOx  through transportation and industrial activities. Conversely, provinces such as Shandong, Henan, Hebei, and Hainan, characterized by substantial agricultural output and a large share of agricultural NH3  emissions, demonstrate NH3  mitigation potential that exceeds NOx  by 5–10%.  3.4 Mitigating NH3  and NOx  for SDGs To quantify the contribution of NH3  and NOx  mitigation to the achievement of SDGs by 2030, we developed an integrated SDG-Nitrogen index system (Table S9  and Fig. 5  ). The results demonstrate that under the maximum technically feasible reduction (MFR) scenario, all 31 provinces in China witness an improvement in their SDG index scores. China's SDG index scores associated with NH3  and NOx  have risen from 60 to 72, representing a 14% increase. Among the 11 SDGs closely linked to NH3  and NOx , substantial score enhancements are observed, with SDGs 3, 6, and 12–15 experiencing increases of 17%, 20%, 53%, 29%, 14%, and 12%, respectively (Fig. 5 d). The abatement of NH3  and NOx  directly contributes to the reduction in PMs, leading to a decrease in disease incidence and mortality, which, in turn, contributes to the achievement of SDG 3. Notably, we have included the improvement of nitrogen use efficiency as an evaluation criterion for SDG 12. The application of agricultural NH3  reduction measures that enhance nitrogen use efficiency not only promotes SDG 2 by increasing agricultural productivity but also advances the realization of SDG 12. The 2020 assessment of China's SDG progress (Fig. S3 ), based on the UN's Sustainable Development Report 2022 (Sachs et al, 2022 ), highlights its success in eradicating comprehensive poverty, achieving SDG 1 (Yang and Liu, 2021 ). Yet, challenges in meeting SDG 2's targets on malnutrition and sustainable agriculture persist. Efforts in improving education (SDG 4) are aligned with socio-economic development policies (Xiong et al., 2022 ), also benefiting from reduced air pollution's impact on student well-being. Although reducing NH3  and NOx  emissions has seen a 3% progress in gender equality (SDG 5) and a slight 0.1% advancement in urban sustainability (SDG 11), achieving these goals requires broader strategies beyond pollution mitigation. China's most pressing challenge in sustainable development lies in its ecological balance, with SDG 14 and 15 representing major hurdles. Mitigating NH3  and NOx , along with the trend of decreasing nitrous oxide emissions, can alleviate global warming, resulting in a 29% increase in SDG 13. Moreover, emissions reduction leads to reduced nitrogen deposition in water bodies and forests, thereby promoting a 14% and 12% improvement in SDG 14 and 15, respectively. China continues to grapple with marine pollution, particularly along its southeast coast (Targets 14.1 and 14.3), and the issues of ocean acidification persist. Challenges in preserving its biodiversity resources (Targets 15.5–15.6) and addressing severe desertification and land degradation in its western regions (Target 15.3) necessitate enhanced inter-departmental cooperation and improved policy enforcement to propel progress in SDGs 13–15.  3.5 Cost and benefit analysis To evaluate the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of NH3  and NOx  mitigation in China, we conducted a systematic cost-benefit analysis. The total abatement costs associated with the seven sectoral measures mentioned earlier are projected to be 82.1 billion USD. However, when we consider the estimated total economic benefits, which include health benefits, ecosystem benefits, and climate impact, the figure rises to 85.7 billion USD. As a result, the net benefit of mitigation in 2030 is estimated to be 3.6 billion USD (Fig. 6  a). While the national-level net benefit falls short of expectations, this discrepancy can be largely attributed to the significant disparity in costs between NH3  and NOx  mitigation measures. NH3  mitigation proves to be economically beneficial, with total benefits amounting to 64.6 billion USD. In contrast, the total implementation cost is only 5.3 billion USD, resulting in a benefit-to-cost ratio of approximately 12:1. Five provinces, namely Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, and Sichuan, all exhibit net benefits exceeding 3.5 billion USD (Fig. 6 b), with human health benefits constituting the largest portion of the benefits. These health benefits primarily arise from the reduction of premature mortality, particularly through the prevention of respiratory diseases caused by PM2.5  (Murray et al., 2020 ). Hebei province, situated in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, represents a crucial industrial hub in China, where activities such as coal combustion, steelmaking, and intensive transportation contribute to severe PM2.5  pollution (Wang et al., 2020b ; Xue et al., 2021 ). Therefore, reducing NH3  emissions in this province not only reduces the secondary production of PM2.5  but also yields substantial economic benefits. In comparison, the benefits derived from NOx  reduction amount to 21.1 billion USD, while the cost reaches 76.8 billion USD. Consequently, mitigating NOx  emissions does not yield a favorable outcome when considering the combined result. This is due to the greater challenges associated with upgrading NOx  mitigation technology, resulting in higher unit costs of abatement (Mohtaram et al., 2020 ; Qian et al., 2021 ). The costs incurred in Hebei and Shandong provinces are higher than in other provinces, standing at 12.5 billion USD and 8.5 billion USD (Fig. S4 ), leading to higher mitigation costs compared to the benefits of 10.5 billion USD and 6.6 billion USD. This disparity is not only attributable to the high cost of technology but also to the high NOx  emissions in these two provinces, which necessitate costly remedial action and exacerbate inter-provincial disparities. Considering that the cost of NH3  reduction in each province does not exceed 0.5 billion USD, we recommend prioritizing the reduction of NH3  through technological upgrades and policy requirements across China, while simultaneously assisting in the mitigation of NOx  in heavily industrialized provinces to achieve a high benefit-to-cost ratio (Gu et al., 2021 ). We also recommend encouraging energy-intensive industries to undergo technological upgrades and adopt green production to reduce emissions (Zhang et al., 2022 ). Additionally, efforts should be made to enhance public awareness regarding NH3  and NOx  pollution issues, promote environmentally friendly lifestyles, and reduce household emissions.  3.6 Policy implications In the context of global sustainability, reducing nitrogen pollutants is a crucial part of China's efforts to improve air quality. The World Health Organization (WHO) has set a stricter safety standard for PM2.5  concentration at 5 μg/m3 . Achieving this standard makes people healthier (SDG 3) and helps advance education and gender equality (SDG 4 and SDG 5). Additionally, reducing nitrogen emissions benefits the marine environment (Targets 14.1 and 14.3) and protects biodiversity and land ecosystems (SDG 15). The International Nitrogen Management System (INMS) aims to bring together scientists, businesses, and civil society to gather and help shape global policies on nitrogen management. Controlling nitrogen air pollutants supports these collaborative efforts, contributing to SDG 16 and SDG 17. Our study underlines the significance of targeting specific nitrogen air pollutants, particularly the cost-effective reduction of agricultural NH3  emissions, now a key focus in China's Clean Air Act revision. This approach aligns with achieving air quality goals and related SDGs, emphasizing the benefits of eco-friendly farming practices and strict regulatory compliance. Effectively mitigating NH3  and NOx  emissions requires addressing regional challenges and enhancing inter-departmental coordination to implement integrated pollution control policies among different provinces (Xu et al., 2019 ). The SDGs are a comprehensive set of goals that need practical strategies to be fully realized. This includes specific plans for areas like air pollution control. Clear and detailed descriptions are crucial to ensure that these plans are comparable and achievable. Our research methodology can be applied to various areas, such as water pollution and international trade, where similar approaches have been effective (Xu et al., 2020b ; Wang et al., 2022 ). By refining our strategies across different fields, we can contribute to the broader achievement of the SDGs and create a sustainable and healthy future.   4 Conclusion The paper elucidates the consequences of atmospheric nitrogen pollutants, NH3  and NOx , on China's pursuit of the SDGs. The emissions of these pollutants pose a hindrance to the attainment of numerous SDG targets, resulting in notable economic losses, as exemplified by the setbacks in 2020. However, by implementing a package of strategies for mitigating NH3  and NOx  emissions by 2030, it is plausible to diminish economic losses by 33% and 34%, respectively. Moreover, such a reduction could enhance China's progress towards the SDGs by 14%. These proactive actions are not only anticipated to propel advancements in environmental sustainability but also yield economic benefits. This aligns seamlessly with the holistic approach of the SDGs, paving the way towards a more sustainable and prosperous future for China.
