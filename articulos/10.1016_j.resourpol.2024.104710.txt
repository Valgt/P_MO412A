                  Every country seeks to assure development that satisfies the requirements of the current generation without jeopardising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This concept was proposed in the World Commission on Environment and Development’s report, Our Common Future as Sustainable Development (SD). All United Nations members adopted the seventeen goals in 2015 to accomplish the SD. These goals are referred to as sustainable development goals (SDGs) and include 169 targets that must be met by all countries by 2030. The mining sector is critical to achieving the SDGs. While Africa is endowed with much mineral wealth potential for achieving SDGs by 2030, most of these countries are facing the problem of the “resource curse” together with other socioeconomic, environmental, and political challenges, such as civil war and extreme poverty. This review examines pertinent past and current studies to provide an overview of the relationship between the mining sector and SDGs in Africa. Relevant data and information were collected, selected, evaluated, interpreted, and presented in themes, graphs, and tables from diverse bibliographic sources, such as the Web of Sciences, Google Scholar, and grey literature. This study revealed that mining does not involve a single primary point of interaction with a single SDG. Instead, it contributes to multiple goals at the same time. This is because mining operations and businesses have numerous beneficial and negative effects on communities, ecosystems, and economies. It contributes to eliminating extreme poverty, reducing hunger, and improving human health and education in communities. It generates foreign revenue and creates jobs, allowing governments to enhance their socioeconomic infrastructure. However, the mining industry is still overwhelmingly male-dominated, and contributes to environmental problems such as climate change and other social constraints such as political instability.

This concept was proposed in the World Commission on Environment and Development’s report, Our Common Future as Sustainable Development (SD). All United Nations members adopted the seventeen goals in 2015 to accomplish the SD. These goals are referred to as sustainable development goals (SDGs) and include 169 targets that must be met by all countries by 2030. The mining sector is critical to achieving the SDGs. While Africa is endowed with much mineral wealth potential for achieving SDGs by 2030, most of these countries are facing the problem of the “resource curse” together with other socioeconomic, environmental, and political challenges, such as civil war and extreme poverty. This review examines pertinent past and current studies to provide an overview of the relationship between the mining sector and SDGs in Africa. Relevant data and information were collected, selected, evaluated, interpreted, and presented in themes, graphs, and tables from diverse bibliographic sources, such as the Web of Sciences, Google Scholar, and grey literature. This study revealed that mining does not involve a single primary point of interaction with a single SDG. Instead, it contributes to multiple goals at the same time. This is because mining operations and businesses have numerous beneficial and negative effects on communities, ecosystems, and economies. It contributes to eliminating extreme poverty, reducing hunger, and improving human health and education in communities. It generates foreign revenue and creates jobs, allowing governments to enhance their socioeconomic infrastructure. However, the mining industry is still overwhelmingly male-dominated, and contributes to environmental problems such as climate change and other social constraints such as political instability.

This concept was proposed in the World Commission on Environment and Development’s report, Our Common Future, by Brundtland (1987) , as sustainable development (SD). The United Nations (UN) Summit on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 was founded on an effort to develop a worldwide agenda for change. The “Earth Summit" stressed the interconnection and evolution of social, economic, and environmental issues, highlighting that one has an impact on the others and so should be considered during development. Agenda 21, the action plan for achieving SD, was developed at the summit (UN, 1992 ). The concept of clear linkages between environmental, economic, and social challenges was first proposed during a conference held in Stockholm from June 5 to 16, 1972 (UN, 1972 ). The conference had a substantial and long-lasting impact on environmental issues. All UN members adopted the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 to accomplish the SD. The seventeen SDGs include no poverty, no hunger, good health, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, renewable energy, good jobs and economic growth, innovation and infrastructure, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption, climate action, life below water, life on land, peace and justice, and partnerships for the goals (Bishoge et al., 2018 , 2020 ; UN, 2018 ). Mining businesses typically produce revenues, job opportunities, and national economic growth through their operations (Esteves et al., 2013 ). However, most mining activities have had a detrimental influence on the environment. By identifying opportunities for shared action and engagement with the sector, government and civic organisations must work together to ensure that the benefits of mining have a positive impact on the natural environment, climate change, and social capital. Mining activities should be performed with the goals of producing less waste, extracting responsibly, using safer procedures, adopting innovative sustainable technology, reducing emissions, increasing the well-being of local communities, and practising environmental stewardship (Deveci et al., 2023 ; Litvinenko et al., 2022 ). SD commitment benefits from improved partnerships among governments, mining firms, and communities, and increased access to financial resources. Failure to actively interact with the SDGs puts mining operations at risk in the short and long term, negatively affecting SDG realisation (Kennedy et al., 2020 ). While the mining sector is expected to help achieve the SDGs by 2030, other scholars argue that artisanal and small-scale mining will not contribute meaningfully to the SDGs by 2030 or in the future because no one cares about the artisanal and small-scale mining sector for a variety of reasons, including limited investment and low policymaking attention (political will) (Clifford, 2022 ). To achieve the SDGs by 2030, Africa has high mineral wealth potential, as indicated by the presence of materials such as tanzanite, gold, diamonds, uranium, platinum, and coal. South Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Botswana, Ghana, Angola, and Namibia are six of the top ten gold- and diamond-producing countries in the world (Markwitz et al., 2016 ). However, the majority of these countries have been dealing with the “resource curse”, as well as other socioeconomic, environmental, and political issues such as civil war and extreme poverty (Bishoge and Mvile, 2020 ). The “resource curse” has been associated with the presence of minerals, oil, and gas because these resources necessitate large investments and result in the development of enormous wealth. Because of the nature and magnitude of the cash needed to invest in natural resource extraction, most large-scale natural resources are harvested by foreign-owned companies because of a scarcity of African investors with substantial capital available to invest. As a result, international investors benefit the most and return a large portion of their earnings to their home nations. Several African government leaders have signed resource extraction deals that benefit international companies. For instance, these include low royalty rates and large tax exemptions, as well as stabilising measures that bind governments to a tax structure of up to ten (Gajigo et al., 2012 ; Hilson, 2019 ). All of these factors benefit international investors while providing minimal benefit to African governments. Furthermore, in several African nations, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Sierra Leone, Liberia, South Sudan, South Africa, and Uganda, mining has been linked to increasing marauding armed groups, social crimes such as theft, bouts of civil instability, and ethnic and political violence (Marais et al., 2022 ; Ojewale, 2022 ). Mining has also contributed to environmental issues such as climate change, deforestation/habitat destruction, pollution, soil erosion, human–wildlife conflict, and biodiversity loss (Sefi et al., 2017 ). Despite the issues listed above, the mining sector has contributed to the socioeconomic growth of African countries. Mining helps economic development by strengthening other industries, earning foreign currency, creating job opportunities, generating capital, developing towns and large cities, increasing international relations, diversifying the economy, stimulating construction activity, and supplying energy (Hilson, 2020 ; Marais et al., 2018 ; Taušová et al., 2017 ). This is accomplished because mining provides important raw material sources for industry, thus supporting construction, innovation, and even food production (Wincewicz-Bosy et al., 2021 ). As a result, to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive study or review has investigated the relationship between mining operations and SDGs in Africa. This review presents a detailed, critical, and objective analysis of past and current studies on how the mining sector influences African SDG attainment. To achieve this objective, the researchers employed information and data from the scientific and grey literature, films, case studies and mass media storeys relevant to mining and SDGs in Africa. Data and information were obtained from a variety of sources, including academic journals and articles, books, government and nongovernmental organisation reports, databases such as Google Search, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, and social media searches such as YouTube documentaries. The data were extracted from relevant studies, followed by data organisation and analysis and theme-based reporting. Themes are based on the influence of mining on each SDG.  2 Mining and SDGs in Africa Significant attempts have been made in African countries to incorporate the SDGs into national development plans and strategies through coordination of execution and prioritisation of specific targets and indicators between units and departments. However, it has been stated that slow development necessitates additional action to reach targets. For example, the aggregate average score across all African member states in 2020 was 53.82 (ECA, 2022 ), implying that the African continent is just halfway to attaining the SDGs and targets by 2030 after four years of SDG implementation. Every country has some form of mining activity, the importance of which varies according to resource endowment and level of development (Morrissey et al., 2016 ). Mining lacks a single primary point of contact with a single SDG (International Council on Mining and Metals, 2024 ). Instead, operations have the unique potential to contribute to several goals simultaneously. This is because mining activities and businesses can have various positive and negative consequences on communities, ecosystems, and economies. The following subsections critically examine the relationship between mining and SDGs in Africa. 2.1 SDG 1: poverty elimination This goal calls for the elimination of extreme poverty in all its forms by 2030. It also strives to provide social protection for the poor and vulnerable, expand access to essential services, and assist individuals affected by climate-related extreme events as well as other economic, social, and environmental shocks and calamities (International Council on Mining and Metals, 2024 ). While Africa’s extreme poverty rate of 43.1 % in 1981 was approximately equal to the rest of the world’s rate of 42.8 %, Africa’s extreme poverty rate of 35.5 % by 2015 was 6.8 times the rest of the world’s rate (Aikins and McLachlandu, 2022 ). Africa has the highest rates of extreme poverty in the world (Kharas and Dooley, 2021 ). The majority of poverty is located in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), with Central Africa having the greatest extreme poverty rate of 54.8 %. Only North Africa achieved the SDG objective of a poverty rate of less than 3 % in 2019 (Aikins and McLachlandu, 2022 ) (see Fig. 1  ). However, poverty levels in most African countries have marginally decreased since 2015, despite an increase in the number of impoverished individuals. For example, it is anticipated that by 2030, more than 479 million Africans (28.1 % of the population) will be living in extreme poverty (Aikins and McLachlandu, 2022 ). Several factors have contributed to this minor drop, including encouraging inclusive economic growth, economic and institutional reforms, boosting microfinance institutions and programmes enhancing marketing systems, and facilitating cash/income transfer programmes. Mining helps alleviate poverty by generating income and creating prospects for growth in lateral or downstream industries, as well as through investments that enable better social services and catalyse improvements in physical infrastructure (Azubuike et al., 2023 ). Mining provides African governments with foreign cash and budgetary resources. Mining’s well-managed net foreign exchange and taxes can be used to expand the national economy and fund poverty-reduction projects and programmes (Gamu et al., 2015 ). Mining provides financial incentives for the growth of local economies by providing training, social services, and public amenities such as clean water, transportation, energy, and infrastructure. Namibia, South Africa, Ghana, and Botswana are some examples of countries that have effectively controlled and exploited foreign exchange and mining taxes to boost socioeconomic growth. Artisanal and small-scale mining employs more than ten million people in African countries, primarily in Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Niger, Tanzania, the DRC, Ghana, Madagascar, and Zimbabwe (Mugai, 2020 ). Artisanal and small-scale miners create high-value products such as gold, silver, diamonds, and gemstones. These minerals bring in a lot of money. Gold and diamonds, for example, are estimated to create more than US$1 billion in SSA each year (World Bank, 2023 ). Furthermore, large-scale mining, oil, and gas sectors employ approximately two million people in Africa each year, and the creation of one direct job in the mining sector can generate twenty-seven additional jobs in the wider economy, including between 2 and 25 jobs created with suppliers, vendors, and contractors to the mine and miners and their families, which are typically provided through small and microenterprise activities. South Africa, the DRC, Botswana, Ghana, Angola, and Namibia are among the countries with large-scale mining enterprises. Only Botswana, Gabon, Namibia, and South Africa are upper-middle-income countries. However, if the income generated by the mining sector is not well managed, this can lead to the “paradox of plenty," which occurs when resource-rich countries fail to fully benefit from the wealth of their natural resources, resulting in a failure to respond effectively and efficiently to public welfare requirements (Bishoge and Mvile, 2020 ). Despite their natural richness, certain nations, such as the DRC, Somalia, and Burundi, are among the poorest in Africa and the world, with a GDP per capita of less than US$1,603 (World Population Review, 2023 ) (see Fig. 2  ) and political instability. Corruption, widespread poverty, restricted human development, weak institutions, stifled freedom of expression, and a lack of openness and accountability are important manifestations of the resource curse. All of these concerns have been expressed in most mineral-rich African countries. Every government should avoid dangers that could impede the reduction of poverty in communities. These threats include, but are not limited to, the relocation and resettlement of mining-affected people without proper support for sustained livelihoods. (Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment, 2020 ).  2.2 SDG 2: ensuring zero hunger This goal calls for the elimination of hunger through increased food security and nutrition, as well as the promotion of sustainable agriculture (International Council on Mining and Metals, 2024 ). In 2020, approximately 2.4 billion people, or more than 30 % of the world’s population, were moderately or severely food insecure and lacked regular access to adequate food (FAO et al., 2023 ). While 828 million people face hunger and 924 million face extreme food insecurity, globally, 2.3 billion people face moderate or severe food insecurity (Compassion International, 2023 ). The number of people suffering from food insecurity gradually climbed throughout and after the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than 345 million people facing high levels of food insecurity in 2023, up from 200 million people before the epidemic (Ismail and Bruneau, 2022 ). Although agriculture fuels the economies of many African countries, the continent continues to suffer from food insecurity and poor nutrition because of restricted access to technologies, political instability, weather conditions, and poor government priority in the agricultural sector. In 2020, more than 119.5 million people in Africa, particularly in SSA, were food insecure (Compassion International, 2023 ) (see Table 1  ). Furthermore, famine is anticipated to affect at least 129,000 people in Burkina Faso, Mali, Somalia, and South Sudan (Steensen, 2023 ). Mining and agriculture are inextricably intertwined because of agriculture’s reliance on mined inputs, land and water resources, and labour. These factors are also indirectly related to areas where mining companies have developed infrastructure to promote agricultural development. Mining and other extraction industries have a considerable impact on the food security of the local population. Mining generates large profits that can be used to promote agricultural activities. Mining profits can help farmers increase their output, offer financial assistance for agricultural inputs, and provide them with informal insurance. According to Yeboah (2016) , mining generates additional cash that might significantly help farmers improve their productivity in Ghana. This is also evident in north-western Tanzania, where small-scale miners frequently invest mining profits in agricultural development (Poignant, 2023 ). Mining is prioritised to lessen the dangers associated with crop growing and food crop production. Farmers in Ghana’s Ashanti area, for example, are diversifying into artisanal and small-scale mining to mitigate risks such as irregular rainfall patterns, a lack of access to land, farm inputs and credits, poor and inaccessible roads, and decreased cocoa producer prices (Yeboah, 2016 ). Mining also generates minerals such as phosphorus, which can be used to make fertiliser. Mineral fertilisers are materials, either natural or synthetic, that contain nutrients necessary for regular plant growth and development. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are the three basic plant nutrients that are used in substantial quantities in fertilisers. Significant levels of sulphur, calcium, and magnesium are also necessary (Ocansey, 2013 ). These mineral fertilisers have been utilised to boost agricultural production in all African countries (Chianu et al., 2012 ; Dimkpa et al., 2023 ; Gram et al., 2020 ; The World Bank and IFDC, 2023 ). Mining, however, necessitates the use of vast areas of land that could otherwise be used for agricultural cultivation. For example, Tsebe (2018)  reported that a substantial proportion (92.6 percent) of respondents lost agricultural land (mostly grazing pasture) due to increased mining activity in Tubatse, South Africa. Because of the land degradation caused by mining activities, the occupied land may become useless in the future. This may also result in direct rivalry for land control and use with small-scale agriculture. In certain countries, such as Ghana, farmers who have been displaced by mining projects have turned to small-scale mining as a source of income. This can perpetuate a cycle of poverty and conflict in which farmers-turned miners are forcibly evicted and beaten by police for entering the land, as claimed by large-scale mining projects. Furthermore, mining causes pollution, which has an impact on agricultural production and agricultural areas. Mining impacts agricultural plants and soils by releasing pollutants such as mercury into plants, rendering them unsuitable for consumption. People who live in mining locations eat food grown on contaminated soil, drink water contaminated with toxic mining waste, and suffer from ailments such as cancer, ulcers, and other stomach issues. For example, Ocansey (2013)  reported that soil and air pollution led to poor crop growth and tree cutting, leaving the area bare for easy wind and water erosion, resulting in poor crop production in towns in and around Kyebi in Ghana’s Eastern Region. Thus, mining corporations must ensure that land and water resources are not damaged and that mined land is effectively rehabilitated to boost agricultural production (Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment, 2020 ).  2.3 SDG 3: promotion of good health and well-being This SD relies on ensuring healthy lives and encouraging well-being at all ages. The world is currently experiencing a health crisis, unlike any other crisis. For example, COVID-19 has caused human suffering while upsetting the global economy and disrupting the lives of billions of people worldwide (Yu et al., 2022 ). Every government is required to offer more efficient funding for health services, greater sanitation and cleanliness, and expanded access to physicians to save people’s lives. The concept of universal health coverage, which states that all people should have access to the health services they require, when and where they require them, without financial hardship, is catalysing the achievement of good health and well-being (Giovanella et al., 2018 ). This encompasses the entire spectrum of basic health services, from health promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care. Despite several efforts to improve health, the African continent has the greatest incidence of diseases, particularly communicable infections. In addition, the region has higher maternal and child mortality rates than the rest of the world (Chersich et al., 2023 ). Mining can directly or indirectly contribute to healthcare systems. The mining industry contributes financially to the development of hospital infrastructure and materials. This is considered in mining companies' and local communities' corporate social responsibility. For example, Bulyanhulu and Geita Gold Mines Limited in Tanzania’s Kahama and Geita districts have built infrastructures such as roads and health facilities for neighbouring local populations (Maliganya and Renatus, 2016 ). Furthermore, mineral businesses employ people who have access to financial resources that allow them to easily obtain health care. Others have health insurance, which allows them to receive good medical treatment and hospitalisation when times are tough financially. Mining also supplies minerals such as gravel, sand, gypsum, and limestone, which are used in the development of infrastructure, including hospitals, clinics, and health facilities. Mining businesses can play a significant role in reducing disease transmission among their employees by following occupational health and safety requirements, improving living circumstances, providing adequate health services, and investing in preventative measures. However, a fundamental issue persists in monitoring and enforcing compliance with national standards, resulting in a high incidence of illness. This is because mining-related air, noise, and water pollution can endanger people’s health (Cossa et al., 2022 ). Migration to and from mineral mines increases the risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis, silicosis, and occupational diseases (Semá Baltazar et al., 2020 ; Stuckler et al., 2013 ). For example, the mining sector is responsible for 33 % of South Africa’s tuberculosis cases, according to Hon. Dr. Aaron Motsoaledi, Minister of Health (Osewe, 2015 ). Lyatuu et al. (2021)  reported an increase in road traffic injuries and non-HIV infectious mortality in large-scale mining communities in Tanzania. Mining operations can endanger mine workers' health and cause social phenomena such as overcrowding (shanty towns), risky behaviours (drugs and alcohol abuse, sexual violence, multiple sexual partners) and cross-border migration, all of which can contribute to the rapid spread of diseases (Dietler et al., 2022 ). In 16 African countries, for example, mining operations increase the likelihood of having many sex partners by 70 %, having a high risk of sex partners by 30 %, and having condomless sex by 70 % (Dietler et al., 2022 ). Multiple partners (those with multiple spouses, cross-border relations, and multiple occasional partnerships), inconsistent condom use, and a high proportion of infected mineworkers who are not familiar with their HIV status, according to Baltazar et al. (2015) , increase the risk of HIV transmission among Mozambicans working in South African mines. Thus, mining companies and governments should ensure that mining workers are not exposed to the risks of fatal accidents, injuries, and physical and mental health problems; that mining-affected communities are not exposed to health and safety risks; and that there are no trigger health and safety risks available for children and women due to mine-related in-migration of labour (Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment, 2020 ).  2.4 SDG 4: quality education This goal advocates guaranteeing inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting opportunities for lifelong learning (International Council on Mining and Metals, 2024 ). Education quality in Africa remains low compared with that in the rest of the globe (Kaledzi, 2022 ; Musau, 2018 ). SSA has the highest rate of educational exclusion among all African regions. Over one-fifth of children between the ages of 6 and 11 are not in school, and one-third of teens between the ages of 12 and 14 are not. Almost 60 % of children between the ages of 15 and 17 are not enrolled in school (UNESCO, 2023 ). Mining corporations can offer training and apprenticeship programmes scholarships, career help, and counselling, all of which improve education in the country. Mining activities typically help communities through socioeconomic growth. For example, the mining industry in Zimbabwe supports educational programmes in rural communities. Because of the mining sector’s contribution to economic development, the DRC constitution established the right to free education in 2010, a policy that is still in operation today (Atemanke, 2019 ). Furthermore, mining corporations in Ghana have launched a few projects, such as the construction of new schools at new resettlement sites where mining activities are occurring. Other mining corporations offer scholarships to local communities in nearby towns. For example, in 2012, African Barrick Gold in Tanzania donated more than US$1.5 million in free lodging, tuition, equipment, and housing to students in neighbouring schools (Tanzania Daily News, 2012 ). Sokoine University of Agriculture has partnered with the industry to develop new mining and environmental courses. Furthermore, Anglo American Platinum Limited annually awards scholarships to students residing in the company’s host communities/areas of influence to pursue postsecondary education in South Africa (Zabursaries, 2023 ). Other mining businesses devote financial resources to training qualified individuals to carry out research, development, and innovation projects in their organisations. Geita Gold Mining Limited, for example, has implemented a number of initiatives to develop its people at all levels, from entry-level and graduates to middle managers and executives, as well as to promote succession planning to place more Tanzanians in leadership positions and reduce reliance on foreign expertise. Approximately 116 students from various high academic institutions were offered internships between 2020 and 2023 (The Citizen, 2023 ). The company has a strong training and development system that covers all aspects of its operations and functions, including technical skills, safety standards, environmental management, quality control, compliance, and ethics. Through scholarships, study leave, and tuition reimbursement, the corporation also helps its employees enhance their education and professional growth. Despite this contribution, mining production appears to have contributed little compared to Africa’s enormous mineral resources, which have great advantages. To avoid social unrest, it is necessary to guarantee that resettled mining towns have access to schools with suitable infrastructure and resources, as well as to train and employ local individuals rather than recruiting trained and unskilled labour from outside (Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment, 2020 ).  2.5 SDG 5: gender equality The goal advocates for gender equality and empowerment of all women and girls (International Council on Mining and Metals, 2024 ). Over the last few decades, African countries have achieved great progress in improving women’s social, economic, and political outcomes (Equality Now, 2023 ). For example, fewer women are dying during childbirth, and millions have risen out of extreme poverty. Substantial attempts have been made in the political sector to expand women’s participation and representation in decision making (Sadie, 2021 ). Although the mining industry is predominantly male dominated, women’s roles are expanding. There are laws, norms, and regulations that mandate that companies secure women’s long-term engagement in the African mining sector. South Africa, for example, performs the best among developing countries, with 21.05 % of women employed in the mining industry (Mangaroo-Pillay and Botha, 2020 ). Women work across the mining spectrum, from artisanal and small-scale mining to large-scale mining operations. However, many women work as manual labourers, and few are engineers, geologists or other scientists; moreover, it is widely assumed that women have fewer opportunities in large-scale mining. Most women, particularly girls, engage in indirect mining-related professions such as selling food and supplies to miners and doing domestic work for third parties; nevertheless, in some situations, they may be victims of sexual assault, harassment, and inadequate pay. Approximately 99 % of African women work in artisanal and small-scale mining (Mutemeri, 2021 ). Women account for half of the approximately nine million people involved in artisanal and small-scale mining in Africa. While some women pursue employment in mining places such as South Africa, others work as miner owners and workers/operators in nations such as Zambia (IGF, 2018 ). Likewise, women have worked as miners in Kenya for decades because they are more honest than men (Gemerts and Emanuels, 2015 ). Despite this accomplishment, women’s contributions to the mining sector are frequently obscured by the dominant profile of men’s positions in mining, which prevents women from meaningful engagement. Women are frequently uninformed of critical information when they are unable to participate in key stages of mining, giving men an advantage that allows them to wield control over financial affairs. Women face barriers to advancement in their careers, as well as prejudice in decision making and payment (Kaggwa, 2020 ). Furthermore, there is currently no credible baseline for women’s working conditions. Meaningful policy reforms and investments in gender equality and a more inclusive and diverse mining sector are hampered as a result. Unfortunately, some children also work in artisanal and small-scale mining. More than one million children are employed in mines and quarries around the world, primarily in developing nations (O'Driscoll, 2017 ). This is a significant breach of children’s rights that endangers their health and safety while also depriving them of education. For example, children are increasingly involved in illegal sand mining and trading in primarily rural areas of East Africa, hidden from view and beyond the reach of anti-child labour advocacy campaigns. This makes it difficult to determine the exact number of young people. These behaviours can be observed in Uganda near Lake Victoria, Tanzania and Kenya’s Sirare–Isebania border, and in Zanzibar’s Mangapwani town and surrounding communities. Furthermore, 40,000 of the 255,000 Congolese miners mined for cobalt are youngsters, some whom are as young as six years old (Lawson, 2021 ). Much of the employment is in small-scale informal mining, where employees earn less than US$2 per day while using their own tools, typically their hands. Children account for 30 %–50 % of the gold mining workers in Burkina Faso, Mali, the Central African Republic, and Niger (Siyobi, 2022 ) (see Fig. 3  ). Most are under the age of 15 years, and some are subjected to forced labour. The involvement of minors in mining activities jeopardises their health, safety, and future. The study, which was conducted in ten countries, including the DRC, Ghana, Mauritania, Namibia, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, concluded that all mining workers should have the right to a safe and healthy working environment, as well as a workplace free of violence and harassment (ILO, 2023 ). Effective and inclusive social discourse, including that of multinational mining corporations and local communities, is needed to ensure social justice and decent work for women in Africa’s mining industry.  2.6 SDG 6: clean water and sanitation As the most basic human requirement for health and well-being, this goal demands universal access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (International Council on Mining and Metals, 2024 ). In 2022, approximately 418 million individuals in Africa lacked sufficient drinking water service, while 839 million needed basic sanitation and hygiene services (UNICEF, 2022 ). Significant disparities continue between urban and rural regions within countries, with rural areas housing approximately 86 % of people without water and 70 % of those without sanitation. Mining companies have contributed to water provision in neighbouring African areas. In comparison to the rest of Africa, most mining corporations in South Africa have contributed to water services. For example, some of the world’s largest mining companies, such as Glencore Plc and Anglo American Platinum Ltd., are supporting a US$1.5 billion water project with the South African government to supply drinking water to major platinum and chrome operations and hundreds of thousands of people. Similarly, the Northern Cape Mine Leadership Forum of the Minerals Council has hailed the completion of the first phase of a project to upgrade the Vaal Gamagara Water Supply Scheme to assure water availability to towns, miners, farms, and other companies in the province. Furthermore, as part of its community development programme Kahama Mining Corporation Limited supported the construction of a water and sanitation system in the surrounding villages of Bugarama and Ilogi in the Shinyanga area, Tanzania (Ikasu, 2018 ). However, mining activities significantly contribute to environmental damage, particularly water pollution. Mining has an impact on surface and subterranean water quality because of acid mine drainage, heavy metal contamination and leaching, pollution from processing chemicals, and erosion and sedimentation. Preventing and controlling surface and groundwater pollution are major concerns in the mining industry. For example, Gugile Nkwinti, South Africa’s Minister of Water and Sanitation, reported that 118 mines pollute rivers, fail to test for contamination, or otherwise pollute waterways in South Africa. Mining in the southern Copperbelt of Katanga in the DRC has increased the concentrations of trace metals and pollutants such as mercury, lead, cadmium, and copper in surface water, thereby endangering public health and biodiversity (Muimba-Kankolongo et al., 2022 ). Mining activities along the Nile River route have polluted the river, which is a significant north-flowing river and source of water in north-eastern Africa (Abdelaal et al., 2023 ; Al-Afify and Abdel-Satar, 2022 ; Macháček, 2020 ; Ramadan et al., 2022 ; Said et al., 2019 ). Mining activities require considerable amount of water that can otherwise be used by humans. For example, miners in Arlit, a desert location in northern Niger, claim to require seven to ten million square metres of water per year to process ore (Dobi et al., 2021 ). For more than half a century, the Orano French Company has had a water monopoly to the detriment of the populace, most whom do not have access to safe drinking water. The water they share with the animals is tainted by radioactivity. Furthermore, studies have suggested that the air around the Mufulira copper mine in Zambia is thick and metallic (Dusengemungu et al., 2022 ; Mwaanga et al., 2019 ). Sulphur emissions can reach 72 to 90 times higher than the norm, resulting in acid rain and soil degradation. Arsenic levels have also been measured up to 16 times the limit values. Mining pollution can also be seen in the oil sector, with Nigeria, Africa’s largest oil producer, being one of the worst in terms of oil pollution. Approximately 18 million litres of crude oil contaminate the soil and water of the largest mangrove swamp in the Niger Delta region (Chinedu and Chukwuemeka, 2018 ). Acacia’s North Mara gold mine tailings storage facility contaminated the Mara River, and the company was fined US$2.4 million by Tanzania’s National Environmental Management Council in 2019 (Rahman, 2019 ). The mine, on the other hand, pollutes tributaries of the Mara River, causing river contamination and, as a result, health issues for people who drink and fish in the river (Nkinda et al., 2021 ). The same problem has been reported in other countries, such as Nigeria (Isah et al., 2019 ; Okolo et al., 2018 ; Sunday et al., 2018 ; Ugochukwu et al., 2022 ), Kenya (Christine et al., 2018 ; Duncan, 2020 ), Senegal (Niane et al., 2019 ), Ghana (Duncan, 2020 ; Kazapoe et al., 2023 ), the Ivory Coast (Kouadio et al., 2023 ), and Uganda (Abraham and Susan, 2017 ). Continuous monitoring of the surrounding waters at mining sites is critical for ensuring the quality of water supplies. To maintain the balance of water in mining activities, it is critical to integrate mining projects with government environmental and water management policies, laws, and actions. This approach will also benefit socioeconomic and political interests in creating universal water, sanitation, and hygiene systems. To achieve a sense of ownership, this should be integrated with local communities. Furthermore, mining enterprises should avoid acid mine drainage and water stress that may result from competing for water supplies with local residents. They should also provide gender-appropriate water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities for female employees (Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment, 2020 ).  2.7 SDG 7: ensuring affordable and clean energy This goal advocates for universal access to inexpensive, dependable, sustainable, and contemporary energy (International Council on Mining and Metals, 2024 ). Inadequate energy availability is an obstacle to socioeconomic and political progress. Although access to energy has increased across Africa, particularly in SSA, it remains low, with more than half of the region’s population still lacking access to power (UNCTAD, 2023 ). In Africa, only Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia have complete access to electricity (see Fig. 4  ). This has a negative impact on the achievement of the SDGs, particularly on health, education, and poverty reduction. Mining uses and produces a large amount of energy worldwide. The mining industry currently accounts for 6.2 % of global energy consumption, with electricity accounting for 32 % of my energy use. Africa’s electricity generation capacity is 80 GW, with 40 GW assigned to South Africa and 23 GW committed to mining projects, primarily in SSA (Cattier, 2020 ). As a result, the mining sector generates approximately 50 % of the electricity produced in SSA. Coal, in particular, continues to supply Africa’s energy needs. Coal resources can meet the world’s energy needs while also helping to provide inexpensive energy access to the world’s poor, particularly in emerging nations such as Africa (Hafner et al., 2018 ). Africa has a wealth of coal resources that can play a significant role in African energy production and consumption. In South Africa, for example, coal accounts for more than 75 % of the total energy consumption. The use of coal for electricity generation is supported by South Africans' availability, accessibility, dependability, and cost. Coal is also a major source of energy in Botswana. Furthermore, mining consumes 50 % of the total electricity consumption in SSA and up to 35 % in economies such as Mozambique, Guinea, and Sierra Leone (Lin and Sai, 2022 ). The mining industry consumes 14 %–30 % of total energy in South Africa, with the platinum mining industry supplying 40 % (Botha, 2022 ). Mining companies should increase their energy efficiency and infrastructure and limit excessive usage. Moreover, the use of renewable energy resources such as solar, wind, and geothermal energy systems should increase, as these resources can lessen disturbances to mine sites while also improving energy delivery to neighbouring areas.  2.8 SDG 8: decent work and economic growth The goal is to promote inclusive, long-term economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. With the population forecast to more than double by 2050, from 1.465 billion to 2.93 billion, Africa is undergoing a tremendous population increase, and the population of youth (aged 15–24) is expected to more than double. Among 52 countries, the average jobless rate for 2022 was 9.53 percent. South Africa had the greatest score of 29.81 %, while Niger had the lowest value of 0.53 % (The Global Economy, 2022 ) (see Fig. 5  ). A large majority of Africa’s expanding youth population resides in rural areas, where employment and economic prospects are scarce and labour productivity is low. Young women and youth with impairments face additional challenges. The mining sector is vital to Africa’s economic growth and development, and to social justice and decent labour. The mining industry in Africa employs both direct and indirect workers in the surrounding communities (Dikgwatlhe and Mulenga, 2023 ). Mining operations require a long-term and critical mass of experts, such as geologists, mechanics, chemists, laboratory workers, environmentalists, engineers, metallurgists, economists, policy and research analysts, and accountants. These people are in charge of all aspects of mining development, management, marketing, and use. Non-professional employment includes office assistance, security, driving, and cleaning. Delivery chain tasks include office provision, clothes, food and fuel delivery, replacement parts, and equipment maintenance. Only 1 % of Africa’s workforce works in the mineral, oil, and gas industries (UNCTAD, 2015 ). Artisanal mining is expected to generate more than 8 million direct jobs, supporting more than 45 million people across the continent. South Africa leads mining businesses by employing approximately 293,650 people directly (OECD, 2017 ). However, African governments continue to face a shortage of skilled, trained, and experienced people for mining sector development and R&D operations, forcing them to rely on professionals from other nations. Moreover, foreigners have been involved in small-scale mining, which is a local community activity. By 2016, for example, more than 50,000 Chinese citizens had relocated to Ghana to mine gold (Hausermann et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, Tanzania lacks sufficient competent and experienced experts for processing gems and jewellery, necessitating the provision of visas for foreigners to come and assist (Stevens, 2019 ). However, because more people, particularly youth, suffer from underemployment and a lack of appropriate working conditions in Africa, it is critical to generate more stable, direct, and indirect jobs that support socioeconomic growth and protect the environment. Governments must avoid over-reliance on mining for economic and employment purposes, and guarantee that mining sites have excellent labour standards and safe working conditions. Child labour should be abolished in mining operations and supply chains (Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment, 2020 ). Local labour should be fairly compensated to guarantee a comfortable living.  2.9 SDG 9: industry, innovation, and infrastructure This goal calls for the development of resilient infrastructure, the promotion of inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and the encouragement of innovation (UNDP, 2023 ). Industry is critical for efforts to generate long-term output growth and improve the socioeconomic well-being of African countries. Infrastructure has contributed to more than half of Africa’s improved development performance, and it can fuel future growth in the area. Innovation boosts economic output, and investment in human capital will be critical in the coming decade. Despite the tremendous potential of industry, infrastructure, and innovation for attaining sustainable and equitable growth, Africa continues to lag behind the rest of the world in terms of industry, infrastructure, and innovation development (AFR-IX telecom, 2022 ). Mining is an industry that requires scientific and innovative thinking in many fields, including geology, mine engineering, mineral processing, supply, and marketing. Innovation in equipment, management, and techniques improves these industries’ productive processes and represents a chance for mining businesses to contribute to the goal. African mining companies are rapidly implementing cutting-edge technology to enhance their operations. Autonomous systems, drones, the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, block chains, and clean energy are examples of these new technologies (Campbell et al., 2021 ). However, the adoption and use of these modern technologies in Africa is currently low because of emerging challenges such as skill acquisition, a lack of structured data ecosystem, ethics, government policies, insufficient infrastructure and network connectivity, uncertainty, and user attitude (Ade-Ibijola and Okonkwo, 2023 ). Furthermore, the usage of these technologies increases the demand for people with new and advanced technological abilities (Bessen, 2015 ), which are in short supply in Africa, necessitating the hiring of outside experts. This impacts the chances of local workers in the mining industry. Furthermore, there are various mining innovation concepts such as digitalisation, better resource characterisation and mine design, new financing models (like community or crowd funding), autonomous equipment and operations, new business models and customer relations, shared infrastructure, enhanced transparency and traceability, low environmental footprint mining and renewable energy solutions that depict synergies between the SDGs and imbalances between individual SDGs (Endl et al., 2021 ). Furthermore, the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) has emerged as a new source of opportunity and risk for mining corporations. Majority of mining enterprises use digital technologies to improve mining operations (Signé, 2021 ). For example, in 2021, the South African Minerals Council and PricewaterhouseCoopers released the ‘10 Insights into 4IR' report, which stated that the South African mining industry was increasingly using innovative technologies to run more efficient operations, manage risk, improve health and safety, and reduce the cost of maintenance and extraction, in addition to pursuing skill uplift (Minerals Council, 2021 ). Moreover, the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) has emerged as a new opportunity and challenge for mining companies. Most mining companies use digital technologies to enhance mining operations (Signé, 2021 ). For instance, in 2021, South Africa’s Minerals Council and PricewaterhouseCoopers launched ‘10 Insights into 4IR’ report, which highlighted that the South African mining industry was increasingly using innovative technologies to run more efficient operations, manage risk, improve health and safety, reduce the cost of maintenance and extraction and pursue skill uplift. Furthermore, the use of digital technology increased both before and after the introduction of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed the use of 4IR technology, allowing mineral corporations and governments to better manage the epidemic (Agbehadji et al., 2021 ). While automation in mining increases production and reduces environmental impact, it also presents social and economic issues (Paredes and Fleming-mu, 2021 ). The use of automated processes and robots alters the employment structure (labour substitution), diminishing prospects for local and low-skilled occupations (Frey and Osborne, 2017 ; OECD, 2019 ). This leads to an unpredictable future of job attainment, workers' inability to find work, workers' struggle to stay at their jobs despite their qualifications or abilities, workers’ insecurity about potential careers, and a lack of resources to pursue another profession (Chigbu and Nekhwevha, 2021 ). Furthermore, automation in mining reduces salaries for low-skilled workers while increasing earnings for high-skilled workers, thus exacerbating inequality between and within individuals and regions (Paredes and Fleming-mu, 2021 ). In general, automation will result in significant job displacement and increased unemployment, particularly in labour-intensive industries such as mining (Parschau and Hauge, 2020 ). The mining industry has accelerated the growth of domestic industries such as those for processed meals and manufactured goods. For example, mining employees require meals and protective clothing such as headgear, rain gear, coveralls, and high-visibility jackets, as well as a helmet, gloves, boots, and protective padding. All of these requirements are met by other manufacturing and processing businesses. Mine Africa Safety Solutions in South Africa, MD Services Labour Brooker in the DRC, Gretpro Industrials in Zimbabwe, and EpiCro in Kenya and Tanzania are examples of mining safety equipment industries. Access roads, storm water services, box cuts for new mining portals, railway lines, and other infrastructure are all part of the mining infrastructure. Furthermore, the mining industry has been directly or indirectly involved in infrastructure improvements, such as roads, railways, and airports. According to development experts, mineral, oil, and gas income might assist many countries in paying for much-needed roads, bridges, dams, and other infrastructure through foreign direct investment to achieve sustained economic growth and eliminate poverty. However, establishing suitable infrastructure networks remains a challenge (Bonfatti and Poelhekke, 2017 ). For example, prospecting enterprises/companies and their mining company partners with large bulk mining projects in southern and eastern Tanzania, the DRC, Burundi, and Rwanda reported that a lack of infrastructure or dysfunctional states was a major roadblock. Much effort is required to update the infrastructure.  2.10 SDG 10: reduced inequalities This aim calls for the reduction of income inequalities as well as inequalities based on age, gender, handicap, race, ethnicity, origin, religion, or economic or other position within a country (International Council on Mining and Metals, 2024 ). The goal also addresses national inequities, such as those related to representation, migration, and development assistance. Africa has greater income and non-income inequalities than the rest of the globe, with South Africa having the highest rate of measured inequality (Leibbrandt and Shipp, 2019 ). In Africa, labour income disparity has by far the greatest impact on aggregate inequality. Economic growth is less efficient at reducing poverty in countries with large initial income disparities, and a combination of economic growth and inequality reduction is needed to have a substantial impact on poverty. However, since 2000, inequalities in education, health, and gender have been greatly reduced, which may eventually lead to an improvement in people’s well-being (Adesina, 2016 ). Inequality in labour income has by far the largest effect on aggregate inequality in Africa. Countries with high initial income inequality find economic growth to be less efficient at reducing poverty, and a combination of economic growth and reductions in inequality is needed to significantly reduce poverty. However, since 2000, inequalities in education, health, and gender have been significantly reduced, which might eventually lead to improvements in people’s well-being (Adesina, 2016 ). Mining has contributed to alleviating poverty in many African countries by creating job opportunities that minimise local pay discrepancies. This encourages social inclusion and improves people’s lives. However, there remains a salary disparity between men and women in the field, with women earning much less than men. Gender discrepancies occur in terms of employment access and employment type. For example, artisanal mining is an informal sector that exposes most women to manual labour that is difficult to execute, risky and non-regulatory. For example, artisanal mining is frequently performed without personal protection equipment and in chaotic situations, resulting in hundreds of deaths and injuries among women and men in the DRC (Beaule, 2023 ). Furthermore, 42 people died in Zimbabwe from small-scale mining activities in 2020. The majority of mining activities in Africa occur in indigenous areas where traditional communities have their own culture and expertise that must be respected and treasured. Indigenous rights are part of a larger movement towards more environmentally and socially responsible mining practises. Inclusion of indigenous tribes in mining governance promotes reconciliation and equity. This should be accomplished by providing job opportunities, social activities and initiatives, land management, and training (Serfontein-Jordaan and Dlungwane, 2022 ). For example, noted that mining firms in South Africa execute corporate social responsibility projects aimed at achieving socioeconomic and environmental sustainability within their host local communities by incorporating them in decision-making. Mining businesses should identify the requirements, culture, and dynamics of local populations before and after the formation of the mining industry to reduce the likelihood of disparities. Furthermore, neighbouring countries with mining companies frequently face conflict, resulting in disparities among their citizens across borders (Oh et al., 2023 ). For example, the DRC, Uganda, and Rwanda have been at odds with mineral resources in the eastern region of the DRC. As a result, the governments of these countries should promote equality by cooperating in peace-making and sharing border infrastructure. Governments must guarantee that local inflation due to in-migration is reduced, and equal and equitable revenue expenditure and distribution is promoted to enhance regional equality within and across countries and lower the wage gap between expatriates and local workers (Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment, 2020 ).  2.11 SDG 11: sustainable cities and communities This goal calls for cities and human settlements to be inclusive, safe, resilient, and long-lasting. For all of us to survive and thrive, innovative, intelligent urban design is needed to create secure, affordable, and resilient communities with green and culturally inspiring living conditions. Cities and metropolitan areas are home to approximately half of the world’s population (OECD, 2020 ; UN, 2014 ). Rapid urbanisation is being driven by higher economic growth, enhanced social services, and new technology, which has resulted in mass migration and population growth. However, increased urbanisation has led to the rapid expansion of slums, which now number more than 828 million people, particularly in developing nations. Africa is home to two of the world’s top five slums. Orange Town in Karachi, Neza in Mexico City, Dharavi in Mumbai, Kibera in Nairobi, and Khayelitsha in Cape Town are the five largest slums in the world (Bishoge, 2021 ). Many people live in overcrowded neighbourhoods, in unsanitary circumstances or in badly planned areas. While most African cities are not sustainable, only six cities, namely, Cairo in Egypt (86th), Cape Town in South Africa (89th), Nairobi in Kenya (96th), Johannesburg in South Africa (97th), Lagos in Nigeria (99th), and Kinshasa in the DRC (100th), were among the top 100 sustainable cities in the world in 2022 (Wansi, 2022 ). Moreover, mining activities have created cities such as Cape Town in South Africa, Kinshasa in the DRC, and Luanda in Angola. Furthermore, places such as Tete (Mozambique), Solwezi (Zambia), Takoradi (Ghana), Juba (South Sudan), Pemba (Mozambique), and Kahama and Geita (Tanzania) are rapidly growing and should be on the radar of any mining investor. Cities’ rapid growth has been linked to an increase in social and environmental difficulties such as increased violence, poverty, unemployment, inequities, overcrowding, and degradation of green spaces and water sources. Through the promotion of strategies, land use planning, cultural heritage enhancement, and the restoration of green areas, the mining sector may contribute to the construction of sustainable cities and community development. However, most African mining firms cause conflict by destroying cultural assets and occupying green spaces (Moomen, 2017 ). Mining, for example, is a human activity that destroys cultural heritage in Tanzania. Furthermore, mineral extraction in some regions of the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area has resulted in inadequate planning as well as land tenure and green space challenges (Okla, 2017 ; Puplampu and Boafo, 2021 ). Companies and governments should support the resettlement of mining-affected populations with suitable provisions for livelihoods and social cohesion, observe cultural and natural heritage during mining operations, and minimise air, land, and water pollution (Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment, 2020 ).  2.12 SDG 12: responsible production and consumption This goal calls for the establishment of sustainable consumption and production patterns, which are critical for sustaining the livelihoods of current and future generations. It encourages the prevention, reduction, recycling, reuse, and repair of waste (International Council on Mining and Metals, 2024 ). Unsustainable consumption and production practises are the basis of the three planetary crises of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution. Countries should ensure economic growth that is sustainable in terms of resource usage and emissions and that improves hazardous material and waste management (Chan et al., 2018 ). The goal is to develop a green and circular economy to adapt to or change the current economy into a more sustainable one. While the circular economy desires economic growth that does not expose future generations to serious environmental hazards and ecological scarcity, the green economy seeks economic growth that does not harm people or the environment. A circular economy promotes economic growth, employment creation, and favourable environmental results (World Economic Forum, 2021 ). The circular economy makes a substantial contribution to the development of a sustainable mining industry. As a result, mining activities should adhere to the waste reuse concept across their supply chain to provide socioeconomic and environmental benefits. New options, such as waste reduction, income increase, production improvement, and quality of life enhancement, should be developed to stimulate management techniques and add value to organisations while being environmentally conscious (Schroeder et al., 2019 ). Regulations and legislation in Africa are gradually imposing circular economy-based business strategies. However, considering the economic value of mining in African countries, the mining industry can play an important role in facilitating the transition to a circular economy. For example, over the last four decades, mining in Botswana has accounted for approximately 85 % of national foreign exchange earnings, 33 % of government revenue, and 25 % of GDP (IMF, 2021 ). This approach can aid socioeconomic progress and long-term environmental management. The mining industry typically generates a large amount of waste, which must be incorporated into waste management plans. As a result, one solution is to use waste as power in mining activities across Africa. For example, in the recent African Mining Indaba, important environmental, mineral, and energy players discussed the use of waste as a fuel source as a stringent regulatory compliance in running mineral operations for a sustainable future in South Africa’s mining businesses. However, implementing waste-to-energy systems is dangerous and expensive. To attain these technologies, large and consistent financial and technological resources, as well as trained and experienced employees, are needed (Bishoge et al., 2019 ). Therefore, mining companies and governments should embrace the optimisation and improvement of natural capital use in mining operations to achieve responsible production and consumption. Companies should ensure that resources and waste are recycled, reduced, and reused; that natural resources are replenished; and that waste is designed out.  2.13 SDG 13: climate action This goal calls for immediate action to combat climate change and its consequences. Climate change is a global challenge connected with an increase in natural disasters such as heat waves, droughts, floods, and tropical cyclones, which impede economic, political, and environmental growth. Human activities such as agriculture and water resource management are strained, and human health and other social services such as education, water and sanitation, energy, and transportation are jeopardised. All of these factors have an impact on people’s health and livelihoods. Developing countries, particularly Africa, are the most vulnerable to climate change; they have low adaptive capacity, a significant reliance on ecosystem products for subsistence, and underdeveloped agricultural production systems (Connolly-Boutin and Smit, 2016 ). On average, Africa is currently warming faster than the rest of the world (Nikulin et al., 2018 ). Because of the rapid effects of climate change, large areas of the continent may become uninhabitable, with severe consequences for human health, food security, and poverty. Surface temperatures in the region increase over time as the dry season progresses. Mining and climate change have an impact on one another. Mining, for example, is one of the primary industries subject to climate change consequences, such as rising temperatures, irregular rainfall, drought, and flooding. Natural disasters include the destruction of mining infrastructure, such as containment facilities and buildings; energy sources; storm water and wastewater collection and treatment systems; tailings and waste disposal ponds; and transportation infrastructure, such as bridges, roads, and pipelines (Agboola et al., 2020 ). A change in water supply impacts operations such as exploration, drilling, dust control, cooling, and extractive metallurgy. Furthermore, disasters impact the health and safety of on-site workers (Ndlovu, 2018 ). Mining in South Africa is subject to climate change, and mining companies may reduce the number of workers, particularly semiskilled personnel, as a response to the consequences of climate change. Similarly, Egypt is considered very sensitive to climate change because of its reliance on the Nile River for potable water, power generation, mining, oil and gas exploration, agriculture, industry, fish farming, and machinery cooling (Mehrim and Refaey, 2023 ; World Bank Group, 2021 ). The mining industry consumes a large amount of energy and is a major source of greenhouse gases. It is also responsible for deforestation and local pollution. It indirectly contributes to 7 % of global deforestation. Total carbon dioxide emissions vary greatly across industries, largely because of the type of material extracted and the design and nature of the mining process. For example, the mining sector was responsible for 6 % of South Africa’s total greenhouse gas emissions in 2018 (Motaung, 2023 ). Mining industry investments in Africa should be organised in such a way that the continent can profit from developed-country carbon pricing regulations. Carbon border fees, combined with a tendency towards expenditures on the environment, society, and governance, could motivate multinational corporations to minimise excess emissions and waste by relocating intermediate phases of production closer to the source of resource extraction (Keen et al., 2022 ). This, in turn, would boost foreign investment throughout Africa.  2.14 SDG 14: protection of life below water This goal conserves and use ocean, sea, and marine resources in a sustainable manner. Healthy oceans and seas are critical to the survival of animals and plants because they cover 70 % of the Earth, and humans rely on them for food, energy, and water. Over 3 billion people worldwide rely on marine and coastal biodiversity for their livelihood. Pollution and overfishing should be eliminated to safeguard the oceans and seas. Oceans are used for a variety of purposes in the mining industry, including exporting products to foreign markets, subsea shallow mining, submarine tailings or waste rock disposal, and deep-sea mining. Mining companies can contribute to ocean sustainability by identifying marine-related impacts and mitigation strategies, understanding local communities’ reliance on marine resources that may be negatively impacted by mining, and contributing to ocean and sea protection and conservation. Africa is surrounded by the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, as well as the Mediterranean and Red Seas, which allow for offshore and deep-sea mining. Deep-sea mining is a component of the blue economy and involves the sustainable use of ocean resources to improve the economy, livelihoods, and health of ocean ecosystems. Offshore mining has been practised in several parts of Africa for decades. Deep-sea mining will become a reality by 2030, and African coasts, particularly those of Madagascar, South Africa, Nigeria, Angola, Mozambique, Mauritius, and Namibia, will offer the necessary infrastructure. The Namibian coast is expected to supply 95 % of the diamonds. Namibia was one of the first countries to provide deep-sea mining licences following extensive investigation of phosphate resources in the 1970s. Phosphate deposits have historically been used as a source of fertiliser for agricultural development (Compton and Bergh, 2016 ). In contrast, deep-sea mining poses a hazard to ecosystems such as coral reefs and the livelihoods of local communities (van Putten et al., 2023 ). For example, deep seabed mining has a negative impact on fragile and undisturbed deep-sea ecosystems and biodiversity, affecting fisheries, livelihoods, and food security, as well as compromising ocean carbon, metal, and nutrient cycles (WWF, 2021 ) (see Fig. 6  ). For example, the discovery of gemstones in Madagascar’s largest wetland (in the village of Andilana Avaratra) sparked a mining boom that endangered the ecosystem and the local community (Razafison, 2021 ). Therefore, precautions must be taken before performing mining operations in the ocean or seas. A preventive approach to mining or garbage disposal in coastal areas should be used, as should collaboration among appropriate authorities to establish conservation areas and marine reserves. Furthermore, participation in the development of multi-stakeholder coastal zone management plans for disposing of mine tailings and garbage in accordance with worldwide best practises should be encouraged. This should be accompanied by an assessment of the socioeconomic and environmental consequences for maritime ecosystems and species, protected areas, and marine-based livelihoods.  2.15 SDG 15: protection of life on land Protecting, restoring, and promoting the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems; managing forests sustainably; combating desertification; and halting and reversing land degradation and biodiversity loss are all part of this goal (International Council on Mining and Metals, 2024 ). While the mining industry is important for socioeconomic progress, it poses a threat to terrestrial life. Mining activities involve the loss of vegetation, removal of soil, diversion or modification of streams, and dumping of soil and rock overburden, which causes the death or displacement of plants and animals in the vicinity (Beck et al., 2020 ). Mine construction frequently necessitates a considerable amount of land, and these areas are frequently the locations of previously undisturbed natural habitats. This occurs through the loss of vast amounts of habitat (typically forest) available to construct the mine, followed by further negative effects from the relocation of many people to, living in, and working around the mine. Furthermore, mines release toxic substances such as arsenic, lead, mercury, and dust into the soil and surrounding river systems, where they can have significant and far-reaching effects on downstream creatures. In the Asutifi North District of Ghana, for example, legitimate mining activities and illegal small-scale mining activities result in bare regions such as mining pits and untarred roads, as well as the destruction of plants and animals (Gbedzi et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, uranium exploration has had an impact on wildlife resources, vegetation, and tourism activities at several locations in Tanzania’s Selous (Mariki et al., 2023 ). Mining operations in Limpopo Province, South Africa, according to Shackleton (2020) , have resulted in the destruction of land and livelihoods. Similarly, WWF (2017)  noted that mining activities endanger forest habitats, biodiversity, and ecosystems as well as negatively impact populations that rely heavily on forest resources in Cameroon, Gabon, the Congo, and the DRC. Mining corporations can mitigate these effects through environmental restoration and compensation procedures because most nations have legislation in place to mitigate the biodiversity implications of mining industry expenditures. Environmental and social impact assessments, mine closure and rehabilitation, and biodiversity offsetting are all techniques for reducing the effects of mining on forests and biodiversity. There is also a need for miners and surrounding people to be trained in responsible mining. In Ghana, for example, Gold Bank Resources Limited created capacity-building programmes for artisanal and small-scale miners to gain the skills needed to engage in responsible mining by considering environmental management, workplace health and safety, and community development (Solidaridad, 2018 ). The greater the demand for minerals is the greater the destruction of land and biodiversity. To avert land and biodiversity loss, discussions among mining firms, policymakers, land planners, and conservation organisations are urgently needed (Sonter et al., 2018 ). Measures to reduce biodiversity hazards should be implemented, as advocated by WWF (2017) . These include better mining sector governance, prohibiting and strictly enforcing the ban on mining research and activity in classified protected areas, developing and adopting a common policy and strategy for the development of the mining sector among countries with shared mineral resources, harmonizing national mining codes and related regulatory and tax provisions, developing and adopting a sub-regional zoning plan and national and local zoning plans, and strenuously enforcing the ban on mining research and activity in classified protected areas. This can be accomplished by fostering communication among stakeholders such as local and national governments, the private sector, and civil society to better understand and define the scope of duty of various actors.  2.16 SDG 16: ensuring peace, justice, and strong institutions This goal calls for the promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies for SD as well as the provision of equal access to justice and the establishment of effective, responsible, and inclusive institutions at all levels (International Council on Mining and Metals, 2024 ). To discover long-term solutions to violence and insecurity, governments, civil society, and communities must collaborate. The rule of law and human rights promotion are critical components of this process, as are kerbing the flow of illicit armaments, combating corruption, and ensuring inclusive involvement at all times. African countries have achieved success in socioeconomic development, particularly in economic governance, management, and corporate governance, but have made less progress in democracy and political governance. In general, however, governance in Africa is average and on the rise (Ekpo, 2020 ). Mining and the government are inextricably linked. While mining activities necessitate a conducive political and peaceful climate, they can lead to good governance by eliminating corruption and bribery. Mining corporations have the competence and ability to ensure participation in decision making with communities, the government, and businesses, as well as transparently sharing information about their activities and resolving resource conflicts with local populations (Oh et al., 2023 ). Currently, the majority of large industrial mines in countries such as Tanzania, South Africa, and the DRC are controlled by joint ventures between a foreign corporation and state-owned parastatal mining companies. However, most mining corporations are not transparent about mineral output, mining asset sales, or other payments. The mining industry requires government assistance in the form of good policies, political stability, and strong institutions (Frederiksen, 2019 ). The government should guarantee that it satisfies all of the mining industry’s primary stakeholders, including its citizens, by enacting mining policies and legislation that balance the expectations, demands, and desires of the many mining stakeholders. The government should ensure revenue collection through appropriate fiscal tools, such as royalties and taxes, and support artisanal and small-scale miners through various capacity-building programmes. Corruption and embezzlement among government leaders and mining company owners may be influenced by the mining sector. Even if mines are initially placed in less corrupt areas, most mining locations become more corrupt after they open. Corruption, abuse, and secrecy are historical occurrences in Africa’s mining sector (Bezzola et al., 2022 ). Most African countries with natural resources, such as Guinea, Nigeria, the DRC, Gabon, Zambia, and Mozambique, have engaged in many contracts through corruption, resulting in unsatisfactory natural resource agreements. When a country relies heavily on natural resource earnings, it risks becoming a rentier nation, which is associated with inadequate transparency and accountability from government leaders and officials (Bishoge and Mvile, 2020 ). This is due to an unequal distribution of mineral revenue and public investments, which leads to reliance on foreign aid and assistance. Thus, governments should adhere to international norms of justice in terms of employment standards, avoid corrupt activities, and pay taxes on government-based resources to promote SD, and the public should be included in mineral resource decision making. The Extractive Industry Transparent Initiative and Publish What You Pay, both of which were founded in 2002 to encourage transparency in natural resource management, have been adopted by African countries (Poncian and Kigodi, 2018 ). This has heightened public interest in more accountable and transparent mining operations, and increased pressure on governments and mining companies to uphold higher standards. More initiatives are being developed, such as the African Union Declaration on Winning the Fight Against Corruption, which was released in 2018 (African Union, 2018 ), and Transparency International’s Mining for SD programme which brings together sister organisations from twenty resource-rich nations to combat corruption. Nearly half of the groups are from African countries, such as the DRC, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, Niger, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe (Mining Indaba, 2019 ). Thus, both mining corporations and governments must maintain transparency commitments, minimise conflicts of interest, and exercise due diligence to dramatically improve their transparency and performance.  2.17 SDG 17: partnerships for the goals This goal intends to increase the use of implementation tools and revitalise worldwide SD cooperation. Partnerships are the glue that holds the SDGs together and are critical for making the 2030 agenda a reality. This necessitates a revived and strengthened global partnership that brings together governments, civil society, the commercial sector, the UN system, and other actors, as well as using all available resources. Mining is a transformational development partner. Mining has the broadest and most profound impact on mankind and the environment of any industry (Haddaway et al., 2019 ). Mining companies are at the heart of the global resource supply chain and supply natural resources such as metals and minerals to feed the world’s hunger for advancement. Mining may be a good fit for maximising partnership value through leadership and strategy, systems and processes, skills and support, partnership culture, networks, and relationships. There is a growing relationship among mining companies, governments, civic society, communities, and other companies to improve sector growth. For example, at the African Mining Indaba in South Africa, the African Finance Cooperation and Xcalibur Multiphysics collaborated to support the development of the continent’s natural resource value chain, contributed to the energy transition by reducing reliance on fossil fuels, and supported the path to more diverse and sustainable economies (Kemp, 2023 ). Furthermore, there is a growing relationship between African and international governments regarding the growth of the mining sector. This strengthens their interaction and makes it easier to achieve SDGs because the mining industry is a cross-cutting sector that practically influences all SDGs. Through project finance, certain countries help acquire access to official local and international mineral markets (IIED, 2021 ). Various multi-stakeholder gatherings have discussed ideas for developing public–private partnerships and encouraging more equitable and sustainable mining laws and practises in Africa and around the world to achieve this goal (IISD, 2017 ). Stronger partnerships are thus essential for ensuring environmental preservation and SD by mobilising resources, exchanging knowledge, encouraging the development and transfer of ecologically sound technology, and enhancing capacity. There is enormous potential for making the current financial system more sustainable by incorporating the environmental dimension (Ziolo et al., 2019 ). Growing cooperation among multilateral organisations donors, and the business sector is needed to equip developing nations and beneficiaries with technologies that increase the efficiency of natural resource use, generate less waste, remediate pollution, and mitigate climate change.   3 Conclusion and remarks The 17 SDGs are at the heart of the 2030 Agenda, balancing the economic, social, and ecological components of SD and, for the first time, putting poverty alleviation and SD on the same agenda. Unlike many other industries, mining does not have a single principal point of contact with a single SDG (International Council on Mining and Metals, 2024 ). Instead, operations have the exceptional ability to contribute to several goals at the same time. This is due to the numerous (both positive and bad) effects that businesses and activities can have on communities, ecosystems, and economies. Through poverty reduction, revenue management, regional development planning, local content, social investment, and dispute resolution, the mining sector has made significant contributions to Africa’s socioeconomic and political growth. For example, mining can assure energy efficiency by leveraging enterprises' energy demand to expand power to underserved areas via partnerships that enable the shared use of energy infrastructure, thus contributing to SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy). Mining can contribute to other SDGs, such as stimulating economic growth and employment (SDG 8), constructing more resilient infrastructure (SDG 9), and combating climate change and its repercussions (SDG 13). However, most mining activities have had negative impacts on the environment. Therefore, the government and civic organisations must collaborate to ensure that the advantages of mining have a beneficial influence on the natural environment, climate change, and social capital by identifying opportunities for joint action and engagement with the sector. Mining activities should aim to produce less waste, extract ethically, use safer processes, use innovative sustainable technology, reduce emissions, improve the well-being of local communities, and practise environmental stewardship. Improved partnerships between governments, mining companies, and communities, and enhanced access to financial resources, benefit SD commitment. Failure to actively engage with the SDGs puts mining operations at risk in the short and long term, reducing SDG realisation. As a result, the implementation of the SDGs will require unprecedented collaboration and coordination among governments, nongovernmental organisations development partners, the private sector, and communities. The mining industry is well positioned to make a significant contribution to this success. It is recommended that mining corporations integrate and report on their contributions to the SDGs as a good practise to assist in delivering the SDGs (Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment, 2020 ).
