                  This perspective article discusses the importance of pedagogy in operationalizing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The tourism industry is ever-growing with sustainability concerns. It also consumes a large-scale workforce to sustain this industry. “Can a pedagogy influence the process of workforce development and conditioning their mindset to be sustainability-focused to implement interconnected SDGs?” is a meaningful question to pose at this juncture. The SDGs are very relatable concepts throughout various hospitality and tourism curriculums. Thus, enforcing the idea of SDGs through structured or unstructured fashion in the curriculum can help generate knowledge, which eventually translates to operationalizing the ideas, leading to positive outcomes. As sustainability themes become more relevant and an absolute necessity in the tourism industry, changing the mindset during the process of workforce development could accelerate the operationalization of SDGs.

Keywords Pedagogy  Curriculum  Knowledge  SDG  Workforce development    1 Introduction Sustainability debates remain at the crux of the tourism industry, more so in recent times due to challenges that the industry is facing because of its innate nature coupled with other pertinent issues such as overtourism and mismanagement of tourism destinations (Dodds & Butler, 2019 ; Honey & Frenkiel, 2021 ; Jauhari, 2014 ). However, sustainability has always been a critical area of interest to relevant stakeholders in the industry. As one of the world's largest and fastest-growing industries (Subramaniam et al., 2022 ), Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their relevance to the tourism industry have been discussed more widely recently (Ali et al., 2020 ; Boluk et al., 2019 ; Seraphin & Gowreesunkar, 2021 ). Even though the role of the tourism industry is highly emphasized to meet the SDGs, the pedagogy and its value in operationalizing SDGs during workforce development is in silence. Often, empirical studies and their findings are sought to inform the industry and its practices. However, this is not always easy as academic research and the professional world function parallel, yet there is a disconnection. Therefore, despite their interrelatedness, making connections and imparting a positive change in the industry has proven to be inadequate. As it relates to the tourism industry and SDGs, there seems to be a lack of understanding that pedagogy could play a critical role in generating knowledge and be a medium for change-making. Education and training play a significant role in meeting interconnected SDGs (Singh et al., 2022 ). However, the literature also suggests a dearth of education and training hindering achieving the SDGs (Heleta & Bagus, 2021 ; Rashid, 2019 ). Higher education is argued to be neglected in support of SDG itself, especially in the developing world, requiring reforming and rebuilding of higher education (Heleta & Bagus, 2021 ). Slocum et al. (2019)  state that a consumer-focused mindset and increased industry involvement in curriculum design are dictating the current pedagogical approach deviating from sustainability pedagogy. Therefore, the premise of this paper is to highlight the importance of pedagogy and how pedagogy can be utilized to foster the operationalization of SDGs in the process of workforce development, especially in the university education relating to the hospitality and tourism field.  2 Finding relevance The tourism industry is often viewed as a main economic sector and revenue generator for many destination communities (Goeldner & Ritchie, 2012 ). Accordingly, it consumes a huge workforce to support this industry. The tourism industry accounts for one out of 10 jobs (WTO and UNDP, 2017 ) and continues to be the major employment generator despite uncertainties and crises. As we strive to develop a competent workforce in the industry, this paper pledges to conceptualize pedagogy to foster the operationalization of SDGs. The SDGs are very relatable concepts throughout various hospitality and tourism curriculums. Finding a relevance between various concepts to different SDGs could be an important initial step. The following paragraphs highlight how tourism can be directly or indirectly linked to SDGs. Often these interpretations emanate from tourism concepts, but several core hospitality and tourism courses and their content focus, for instance, hospitality law, human resource management, event management, facility design, food and beverage, hospitality technology, and nutrition, can be easily connected to multiple SDGs. Tourism's economic contribution is known to produce a long-term positive effect on reducing poverty and promoting socio-economic well-being (SDG 1) (KC et al., 2021 ). Likewise, employment and income opportunities also contribute toward that goal (SDG 1) and decent growth and economic development (SDG 8) (Harrison & Schipani, 2007 ). Tourism is also linked to curbing income inequality (SDG 10) (Seetanah et al., 2023 ; Subramaniam et al., 2022 ). Different forms of tourism, such as agritourism, are known to connect agriculture and tourism to foster local production and consumption, along with tackling the problem of food insecurity and fighting climate change through the conservation of natural landscapes (SDGs 2, 12, and 13) (Valdivia & Barbieri, 2014 ). Tourism is closely linked to positive physical and mental health, while tourism funding helps governments at destination communities invest in health infrastructure (SDG 3) (Buckley, 2020 ; Goeldner & Ritchie, 2012 ). Tourism fosters educational opportunities for people from all walks of life, either indirectly or directly through training. Several sustainability certification processes, provision of training from government agencies to conduct sustainable tourism activities, and tourism-based earnings helping educate children among residents cumulatively promote quality of education (SDG 4) (WTO and UNDP, 2017 ). The tourism industry is also frequently linked to promoting gender equality (Alarcón & Cole, 2021 ; Zhang & Zhang, 2020 ). The efficient consumption of water and sanitation protocols for the tourism sector has always been an important topic of discussion (SDG 6) (Loehr et al., 2021 ). There is ongoing advocacy for the use of renewable energy and efficient use of energy (SDG 7) (Dalton et al., 2008 ; Sardianou & Kostakis, 2020 ). Many hospitality facilities are proving to supply solar energy themselves (SDG 7) (Hertzfeld, 2023 ; Maxeon Solar Technologies, 2023 ). Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certifications in hotels are often newsworthy, targeting industry, innovation, and infrastructure (SDG 9) (Neagle, 2016 ; O'Halloran, 2023 ). Literature suggests that 80% of tourism activities take place in coastal areas (Asian Development Bank, 2022 ); life below water (SDG 14) can be easily made relevant with ongoing debates on banning sunscreen, fostering coral reef protection, and avoiding overfishing and overconsumption of seafood (Alonso et al., 2018 ; Downs et al., 2022 ; Huang & Coelho, 2017 ). Likewise, protected area tourism promotes SDG 15 through tourism-funded conservation programs (KC, 2022 ). Tourism destinations are adapting to promote sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11). Promoting green practices such as enabling pedestrianization and public transportation systems are included in the tourism destination management and their carbon neutral program (SDGs 11 and 13) (Parkes, 2021 ). Reducing food mile in support of local production and consumption leads to appropriate climate actions (SDGs 12 and 13) (Parkes, 2021 ). Tourism facilitates intercultural understanding among individuals with a global citizenship mindset who respect different cultures, ethnicities, and religions (Butcher, 2019 ). Meanwhile, different institutions working directly or indirectly in the tourism industry are proactively supporting ethical behaviors to create a just society (SDG 16). The importance of partnerships across a range of tourism stakeholders and organizations at local, national, and international scales to promote sustainable tourism (De Araujo & Bramwell, 2002 ; Graci, 2013 ; Timothy, 1999 ) are often popularly discussed topics linking SDG 17.  3 Pedagogy, knowledge, and the SDGs Pedagogy is instrumental in knowledge generation in a learning environment. The acquired knowledge paves the way to foster translational change (i.e., connecting theory to practice). Kiraly (1995)  states that translational theory enhances empirical understanding of what translational practice is and the ways to accomplish that. Specifically, in formal education, pedagogy enhances knowledge acquisition in a structured fashion (i.e., through curriculum design directly addressing SDGs). However, an unstructured way (i.e., indirectly addressing SDGs based on relevance) can still be able to instill knowledge on SDGs. Teaching professionals should be equipped to facilitate the process as well, which demands strong institutional support to allow a broader understanding of SDGs and practical implications. Knowledge promotes translational changes through the operationalization of ideas from the workforce (e.g., implementing policies and actions supporting SDGs), leading to positive outcomes (e.g., impacts reflecting on SDGs such as minimization of greenhouse emissions, focus on local production and consumption, increased renewable energy usage, and greater advocacy for conservation of terrestrial and coastal resources) (Fig. 1  ). Undoubtedly, a favorable environment in the working industry is needed to act and operationalize ideas. The focus should not just be on individual efforts to operationalize ideas but institutionalize effective implementations; this can lead to pronounced positive outcomes. Indeed, the power of education to promote SDGs cannot be undermined in active learning environments. The use of pedagogy in operationalizing SDGs demands further debate with possible conceptual and empirical examinations.  4 Changing the mindset Changing the mindset is important, and pedagogy can condition the mindset to change regarding the operationalization of SDGs leading to positive outcomes. The concept of sustainability seems to be farfetched and often comes with a lot of ambiguity due to its relevance and applicability to different fields and sub-fields (e.g., hospitality and tourism, engineering, textile, fashion industry, event industry, environmental science, etc.). The term “sustainable tourism” has been around for decades now (Swarbrooke, 1999 ). Yet, the general idea of sustainability is still perceived to be parallel to an environmental component. Therefore, the holistic view of sustainability, which goes beyond the environment to economy, society, and governance, probably will set the foundation for learning the 17 SDGs. As discussed earlier, pedagogy plays a vital role in generating knowledge among students during the process of workforce development. Eventually, it is about changing the mindset. It is the changed mindset that we can hope will change thought processes and working industry environments in achieving SDGs through the tourism industry.  5 Conclusion The tourism industry consumes a large-scale workforce, yet the workforce development in tourism and the use of pedagogy to influence the workforce in operationalizing SDGs is in silence. Education and training play a significant role in achieving SDGs, but literature suggests a void in current practices. Higher education is pointed out to fail to make those connections. The tourism industry and sustainability themes are relevant and widely discussed topics contemporarily, especially due to growing concern over sustainability issues. This paper highlights a critical need to understand the importance of pedagogy in operationalizing the SDGs, especially through the structured and unstructured fashion in the hospitality and tourism curriculums, which needs strong institutional support, specifically the support stemming from a leadership standpoint, to help teaching professionals and curriculum (re)design and change. Foremost, the academic sector should adapt to change and prepare the workforce to promote sustainability in the hospitality and tourism industry. The priority should be on the use of pedagogy to generate knowledge and equip the workforce with the required knowledge to operationalize sustainability across 17 SDG themes. It is equally important to foster conceptual and empirical studies to ascertain a deeper understanding of the relationships between pedagogy and the operationalization of the SDGs. There is a need for the workforce to internalize the importance of sustainability and implementation of sustainable practices in well-functioning industry environments. The workforce with adequate education and training retains the ability to accelerate the process of operationalization of SDGs, leading to positive outcomes.
