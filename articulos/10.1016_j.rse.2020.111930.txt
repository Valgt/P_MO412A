                  With less than a decade left to attain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), this communication aims to improve understanding of the enabling environment that is essential for Earth observations (EO) to be fully adopted within the institutional settings that drive the implementation of the SDGs and the Global Indicator Framework, an effective review mechanism for tracking progress at global to national and local levels. This paper also serves as an introduction to the Remote Sensing of Environment's Special Issue (SI) on Earth Observation for the Sustainable Development Goals. The seventeen contributions published in this SI showcase the application of EO data, methods, and tools to support countries in target setting for the SDGs, including baseline determination, as well as tracking of progress on SDG implementation and informing sustainable development planning and decision making. The majority of published articles focus on Goals 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), 14 (Life below Water) and 15 (Life on Land). We also present our own analysis of existing EO systems available to generate data for SDG indicators addressed via the SI contributions, including main resolution characteristics, and assess factors that hinder the full integration of EO solutions for the SDGs within country processes, institutions of government, and policies. We conclude that an urgent need exists for the EO community to work more closely with local and regional governments and other relevant stakeholders to promote the operationalization of EO solutions for implementing the 2030 Agenda at global to local levels. Our review also illustrates the need for transitioning towards new EO for SDG frameworks that are focused on the knowledge element of the data-information-knowledge-wisdom paradigm, rather than the data and information aspects.

EO prosumers — non-traditional end-users that are adopting EO as both data consumers and information producers — have a key role to play in generating knowledge using EO to monitor, and drive progress on, the SDGs. In addition, the EO community is present in, and can greatly influence, data to knowledge processes (adapted from Metternicht, 2019 ).  Fig. 1   Table 1 SDG targets/ indicators that can be fully or partially derived from EO data. The contributions are divided by the range of the spectrum considered. One implies high importance; Two: medium importance. Weaknesses are related to spatial resolution (SR), spectral resolution (SPR), temporal resolution (TR), radiometric resolution (RR) or historical coverage (HC, extent of the time series). Additional data include census, field collection and spatial databases (SDB), including soil, climate, land ownership, etc.  Table 1           Papers of the Special Issue that address the Goal and Target/ Indicator Target or Indicator Solar-Thermal spectrum Microwave Main weak-nesses Aux. data  Pass-ive HR Pass-ive MR Passive LR Active Lidar Pas- sive Active Radar   SDG 1 - End poverty in all its forms everywhere  Becker-Reshef et al.

This paper also serves as an introduction to the Remote Sensing of Environment's Special Issue (SI) on Earth Observation for the Sustainable Development Goals. The seventeen contributions published in this SI showcase the application of EO data, methods, and tools to support countries in target setting for the SDGs, including baseline determination, as well as tracking of progress on SDG implementation and informing sustainable development planning and decision making. The majority of published articles focus on Goals 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), 14 (Life below Water) and 15 (Life on Land). We also present our own analysis of existing EO systems available to generate data for SDG indicators addressed via the SI contributions, including main resolution characteristics, and assess factors that hinder the full integration of EO solutions for the SDGs within country processes, institutions of government, and policies. We conclude that an urgent need exists for the EO community to work more closely with local and regional governments and other relevant stakeholders to promote the operationalization of EO solutions for implementing the 2030 Agenda at global to local levels. Our review also illustrates the need for transitioning towards new EO for SDG frameworks that are focused on the knowledge  element of the data-information-knowledge-wisdom paradigm, rather than the data  and information  aspects.

The EO community has a key role to play in this regard. EO technologies are contributing, and have the potential to contribute more, towards achieving the 2030 Agenda and its associated goals; tracking progress towards targets through monitoring indicators; supporting coherence in SDG processes and international comparability across indicator outputs; and, driving sustainable development policies and management strategies. The diversity, scope, and scale of the SDGs prompt the involvement of a large number of stakeholders, including United Nations (UN) bodies, National Statistical Offices (NSOs), line ministries responsible for each target/ indicator, suppliers of spatial data infrastructures, data providers, and the international bodies that coordinate them. Reliance on geospatial information and EO data has been gaining momentum as countries, regional commissions, international agencies and other relevant stakeholders have initiated planning, monitoring, reporting, and implementation of the 2030 Agenda at local, sub-national/national, regional, and global levels. The Fourth Synthesis of Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) (DESA, U.N., 2019 ) – a synthesis of key findings from 47 country reports on SDG progress submitted to the UN High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) – concluded that countries across regions are now exploring technological solutions to fit their needs and address issues of data sharing and accessibility; data integration, including sources of data produced outside of the national statistical system; as well as data disaggregation at a high level, which is critical for reaching populations who are most likely to be left behind. With less than a decade left to attain the SDGs, this communication aims to advance understanding of the enabling environment  that is essential for EO technologies to be fully adopted within the institutional settings that drive the implementation of the SDGs and the Global Indicator Framework (GIF) (Assembly, 2017 ; Metternicht, 2019 ). It briefly illustrates elements of the current, multi-scale governance framework for monitoring and reporting on the SDGs, followed by an assessment of factors that contribute to the gap between EO solutions and their operationalization within country processes, institutions of government, and policies. This paper also serves as an introduction to the Remote Sensing of Environment's Special Issue (SI) on Earth Observation for the Sustainable Development Goals. The seventeen contributions published in this SI showcase the application of EO data, methods, and tools to support countries in target setting of the SDGs, including baseline determination, as well as tracking progress of implementation, and informing sustainable development planning and decision making. The final section explores how current EO-related initiatives fit within the data-information-knowledge-wisdom paradigm, reflecting on research gaps that are yet to be addressed by the EO community to produce knowledge  to inform transformation towards economic, social and environmental sustainability.  2 Understanding the governance framework to implement and monitor the SDGs: From global to local The Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs), created at the 46th session of the UN Statistical Commission, was tasked with developing the GIF for the 17 Goals and 169 targets of the 2030 Agenda. In doing so, it classified indicators into three tiers based on the extent of related methodological developments and data availability at the global level (see Metternicht, 2019  for explanation of tiers). The GIF is reviewed annually, currently including 231 unique indicators (UNESC, 2020 ). UN agencies and Conventions are custodians of specific SDG indicators that are relevant to their thematic expertise and/or mandate. In this role, they have responsibility for compiling and validating country data and metadata; developing monitoring guidelines, including definitions and standards, to enable comparability across country data on SDG indicators; strengthening national statistical capacities; and, supporting countries in national monitoring and reporting efforts (Anderson et al., 2017 ). The metadata repository for SDG indicators includes the most recent information provided by the UN System and other international organizations on data and statistics for SDG indicators, which is complemented by the platform of the UN HLPF, where Member States share their VNRs to “conduct regular and inclusive reviews of progress at the national and sub-national levels, which are country-led and country-driven” (DESA, U.N, 2020 ). The Regional Fora for Sustainable Development, convened annually by the respective Economic Commissions (UNECA, UNECE, UNESCAP, UN ECLAC, and UNESCWA),1  1 See Appendix A.   bring together countries, as well as regional and sub-regional organizations, development agencies, academic institutions, civil society, and the private sector to promote policy coherence at the regional level, and facilitate interregional cooperation (UNESC, 2019 ). NSOs play a pivotal role in country-level implementation of the SDG indicators (MacFeely, 2019 ) in the areas of data collection, coordination, validation, and reporting of statistics relevant to the SDGs, and quality assurance and accuracy of the SDG global reporting process.2  2 As stated in the Zero Draft: Criteria for the Implementation of the Guidelines on Data Flows and Global Data Reporting for SDGs prepared by the IAEG-SDGs.   Many SDG indicators have a geographic dimension; therefore, high-quality geospatial information is key in assisting countries to measure, manage, and monitor progress on economic, social, and environmental sustainability. In addition, National Mapping Agencies (NMAs) have a crucial role to play in this process, being responsible for country-level geospatial information systems and spatial data infrastructures. It is therefore essential for the statistical and geospatial communities (including EO) to work together — at global, regional, national, and local levels — via improved coordination among relevant government agencies to address capability gaps, resource constraints, and other cross-sectoral challenges. Country use cases including ones from Sweden and South Africa, (Table 1 SI) as well as Australia (Metternicht, 2019 ) illustrate such partnerships, showcasing how relevant collaborations began and elaborating on cross-sectoral challenges, lessons learned, and the overall value added from these partnerships. EO coordinating bodies such as the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) and the United Nations Committee of Experts on Global Geospatial Information Management (UN-GGIM) work closely with the statistical community, at both national and global levels, to provide inputs into the processes that created and periodically review the GIF (Scott and Rajabifard, 2017 ). This collaboration has practically mainstreamed the idea that geospatial and EO technologies are essential to SDG-related data collection efforts and the ‘Leave No One Behind’ mandate of the 2030 Agenda. In its role of coordinating international efforts to build a Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), GEO is instrumental in promoting the value of EO in support of the SDGs (GEO Mexico City Declaration, 2015 ). Noteworthy in this regard is the EO4SDG initiative within GEO, whose purpose is to extend EO uses for sustainable development and to enable societal benefits through achievement of the SDGs (Earth Observations for Sustainable Development Goals (EO4SDG), n.d ). Tables 1 and 2 (SI) summarize additional efforts led by GEO thematic activities including GEO Blue Planet, GEOGLAM, Human Planet and the GEO Land Degradation Neutrality initiative, among others.  3 Overview of EO contributions to retrieve SDG indicators Recognizing the fundamental role of satellite EO for the SDGs, CEOS established an Ad hoc Team on SDGs (SDG AHT). The SDG AHT promotes better coordination of international space agencies in support of the provision of satellite data for the 2030 Agenda. The CEOS 2020–2021 Work Plan on the SDGs focuses on three SDG indicators that are mature from an EO integration perspective, but for which there are still methodological and data availability issues that require attention: 6.6.1 (water-related ecosystems), 11.3.1 (land use efficiency) and 15.3.1 (land degradation). Table 1   illustrates our own assessment of existing EO systems available to generate data for the SDG indicators, including main resolution characteristics. Out of the 231 indicators, our assessment identifies 33 for which EO data could play a significant role. This SI adds evidence in that most of these indicators require additional information for their accurate estimation (e.g. Vaz et al., 2019 ; Prince, 2019 ; Mulligan et al., 2020 ). In some cases, EO data only contribute indirectly (Stokes and Seto, 2019 ; Mulligan et al., 2020 ; Mason et al., 2020 ), but still provide a relevant data/ information dimension. The most direct connections between SDG indicators and EO systems are within Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) and 15 (Life on Land), followed by 14 (Life below Water) and Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and that is indirectly confirmed by the dominance of papers of this SI focused on those goals (Table 1 ). Three of the SDG do not currently have any indicator that can be reliably estimated from EO data — Goal 4 (quality education), 8 (sustainable economic growth), and 10 (reduced inequalities). However, even in those cases, EO data can provide supporting information related to population distribution or urban structures (Group on Earth Observation, 2017. Earth Observations in Support of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: GEO Report. Inter-Agency and Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goals,  2019 ). In the near future, additional indicators related to Goal 2 (Zero Hunger), Goal 15 and 13 (Climate Action) should provide room for extended contributions of EO to support SDG, particularly in relation to the generation of essential climate variables (#13) (Bojinski et al., 2014 ); essential agricultural variables (#2) (Whitcraft et al., 2019 ); and essential biodiversity variables (#15) (Rocchini et al., 2019 ). In terms of EO sensors3  3 Examples of suitable EO missions and sensors (Chuvieco, 2020 ): Planet, Pleiades (passive HR); Landsat-4-8, Sentinel-2, CBERS, DMC (passive MR); MODIS Terra-Aqua, NOAA-AVHRR, DMSP, PROBA-V, VIIRS, Sentinel-3, GOSAT (passive LR); ICESAT, GEDI and airborne (Lidar); ASCAT, EMSR (passive MW); Sentinel-1, ALOS, Radarsat, Skymed (active MW).   for existing indicators, the most relevant sources are passive sensors in the solar-thermal spectrum. High spatial resolution sensors (< 5 m) within this range of the spectrum are highly important contributors of metrics related to 13 indicators and have moderate importance in the computation of nine additional indicators. Medium spatial-resolution sensors (5–100 m) contribute highly to 11 indicators and to 13 additional ones with medium importance. Low resolution sensors (> 100 m) are relevant for 6 indicators and complementary to another 10. Lidar systems are relevant for metrics related to 9 indicators and complementary to another 4, mostly associated to forest and urban parameters. Radar systems are considered relevant for 3 indicators (forest, disasters, and water) and complementary to another 10. In terms of ancillary data, all indicators require other datasets for an accurate retrieval. The most common are census data (derived from NSOs), spatial databases (soil, climate, roads, ownership) and field data (either through surveys or fixed sensors).  4 Enabling environment for earth observations to contribute to the implementation of the SDGs Despite the shift from traditional statistical techniques (i.e., surveys, censuses) to inclusion of geo-referenced information and data acquired from remote sensing instruments, in situ sensors, and model outputs to produce SDG indicators and inform official statistics, the uptake of EO in support of the global development agenda has been slow and unevenly adopted by countries (Satellite Imagery and Geospatial Data Task Team report, 2017 ). Promising evidence of statistical and geospatial agencies working together towards the implementation of global development agendas is becoming increasingly available (Table 1 SI). However, a number of issues still require attention to ensure timely delivery and successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda. These include EO data discovery and access, standardization, interoperability, harmonization, multiple uses of EO data, infrastructure services, as well as set-up and maintenance of in-situ networks and citizen science observatories (CEOS, 2018 ). As different communities are working to bridge the gap between disciplines and overcome related challenges, understanding the enabling environment  is necessary for EO to fully contribute to the attainment of international, and nationally agreed, developmental goals. An enabling environment  can be thought of as the combination of contextual elements allowing progress to be made towards a clearly defined goal (Akhtar-Schuster et al., 2011 ). Drawing on the analogy of evaluating progress towards establishing an enabling environment for SDG target 15.3 (land degradation neutrality), steps to improve the enabling environment that broadens the use of EO for the SDGs involve overcoming institutional, policy/regulatory, science-policy interface, and financial challenges (Allen et al., 2019 ) (Table 2  ). The following sub-sections illustrate some of the benefits and challenges of integrating geospatial (including EO) and statistical information for more effective solutions in sustainable development, based on Sweden's and South Africa's experiences, and efforts of selected global and regional initiatives that promote EO and geospatial data integration for the SDGs (Section 2, Table 3 SI). 4.1 Institutional and financial The collaboration  between national statistical and geospatial agencies to develop a Federated Information System for the SDGs, such as in the case of Ireland (Table SI 1), represents a good practice example for creating an enabling environment to conceptualize and report on SDG-relevant statistics within a geospatial framework, and promote synergies across often siloed, national authorities. The use case of Statistics Sweden (Table 4 SI) illustrates several challenges associated with efforts to mobilize institutions around the use of geospatial (including EO) data with statistics for the SDGs, while promoting horizontal coherence. South Africa's example (Table 4SI and Table 1 SI) demonstrates the importance of horizontal and vertical coordination between government agencies, and the role of co-designed pilot studies to promote the operationalization of EO in support of effective and accelerated SDG implementation at country level (Table 1 SI). The detailed spatial analysis of indicators at the national level, including a bottom-up flow driven by respective needs at subnational levels, is required to help decision makers and potential geospatial data users realize the value of integration of various data sources (Table 4SI, Statistics South Africa, 2019 ).  4.2 Policy/regulatory The proper functioning of national statistical systems and spatial data infrastructures, in addition to institutional arrangements and sustainable working relationships between the statistical and geospatial (including EO) agencies, as in the case of South Africa (Table 4 SI), is crucial for safeguarding long-term provision and quality of geospatial, EO and statistical data for the SDGs. Open data policies are also of fundamental importance to ensure that individuals and institutions in both developing and developed countries are able to access, process, analyze, extract knowledge, and combine data from different sources to inform decisions, support improved governance, and attain sustainable development. GEO, for example, has strongly advocated for open access EO data policies for many years (Uhlir, 2015 ). In addition, strengthened collaborations across scientific assessments, and across countries, including sharing knowledge and harmonizing data protocols, indicator methods, and procedures to combine statistical, geospatial, and EO data, are important for enabling meaningful comparisons at all levels. Increased evidence of the role of geospatial information in these efforts, including to address data disaggregation  challenges, is manifest in UN-adopted, global indicator methodologies related to fresh water, marine, and terrestrial ecosystems, and sustainable urbanization, with EO integrated as notable inputs (see Table 1 SI).  4.3 Science, technology and policy interface A common need identified across recent efforts to promote adoption of EO technologies for the attainment of the SDGs (Table 1 SI) is partnerships for local support around the use of EO methods and tools, with a focus on capacity development , especially for developing countries (Kumar et al., 2020 ). South Africa's and Sweden's case studies demonstrate the need for improved EO workflows within the statistical production and the need for enhanced use of more automated solutions for merging geospatial data (including EO) with statistics in support of SDG planning, monitoring, and policy making. Steps are being undertaken to reduce EO complexity to allow for their widespread, sustained use and application in support of sustainable development. Additional improvements need to be addressed, however, including in the area of geospatial and EO interpretation to inform policy and create knowledge  for the SDGs. The use cases and initiatives collated in this paper show good advances by the EO community on data, methods, and tools to inform SDG indicators and associated metrics (e.g. Climate Change Essential Variables, Essential Agricultural Variables (Whitcraft et al., 2019 ), global biomass maps, national data cubes (Dhu et al., 2019 ) etc. as exemplified in Tables 2 and 3 SI and Fig. 1  . The EO community has also been making advances in documenting and sharing relevant expert knowledge including: a priori or domain knowledge for framing features extraction (Sims et al., 2019 ; Prince, 2019 ), identification and monitoring of urban change processes that are critical to human well-being including electricity availability and growth without infrastructure services (Stokes and Seto, 2019 ), multi-scale analysis of forest degradation for SDG 15 target monitoring (Mondal et al., 2020 ,) and exploring the potential of data cubes as tools to monitor land degradation at the national level (Giuliani et al., 2020 ), among others. In this regard, Table 2 (SI) presents some ongoing efforts that are designed to promote knowledge sharing, interlinking local to global experiences on the integration of multiple data sources to address gaps and drive progress on the SDGs. SDG indicators should provide policy makers with the necessary knowledge for wise decisions, drawn from information gathered from observed data, whether through EO, social sensing, or other means (Fig. 1 ). To be relevant to the global transformation to sustainability, the EO community needs to expand its focus beyond data and information-related issues. Further research is needed to more effectively establish how countries can leverage new EO technologies for data gathering and analysis, embedded in an EO for SDG framework, and to advance the development of indicators that are complementary to the core GIF. This can support country-based interpretation and more effective and coherent narratives of national progress towards the 2030 Agenda (Metternicht, 2019 ).   5 Final considerations While EO are a critical data source for monitoring and driving progress on the SDGs, UN Member States do not always recognize or have the capacity to leverage this value. This paper illustrates efforts that are underway among NSOs, space agencies, multinational organizations, academia, development agencies, civil society, and the private sector, to fill gaps in value-demonstration and practical guidance on how geospatial information and EO combined with statistics and ancillary data sources can, and are already being used to, inform decisions related to SDG planning, monitoring, and reporting in a timely manner. However, the scaling of these efforts has proven difficult because of ongoing institutional, legal, financial, technological, and science-policy challenges, including: restrictive data policies, EO data continuity, lack of standardization of EO data processing methods, EO data size and complexity, lack of relevant “fit for purpose” data products, capacity gaps, as well as insufficient use cases and good practice examples. Further research and sharing of good practices are required to support delivery on the SDGs using EO. To fully integrate EO activities with the needs of the sustainable development community, and allow EO to function as an enabler for the 2030 Agenda, it is critical to optimize dialogue and collaboration among the statistical, geospatial, and EO communities, at all levels, with a focus on:• assessing data and service requirements from an operational, end-user perspective,  • developing scientifically sound, internationally accepted guidelines to address aspects of data uncertainty and quality,  • co-designing easily accessible, reproducible, and scalable EO products and services,  • building skills and capacity to further develop and operationalize EO applications into sustained, long-term solutions, and,  • shifting resources in support of modernized, integrative information systems. In short, this implies designing new EO frameworks, more focused on the knowledge  element of the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom  paradigm (Section 4, Fig. 1 ).    The contributions to this SI illustrate that most of the SDG indicators for which EO can play a significant role require additional information for their accurate estimation. Many of the methods and applications included in this SI present examples of EO serving as direct contributors of metrics related to specific indicators or as proxies in support of data/ information. The prospect of fully integrated, operational use of EO for the SDGs by countries and relevant stakeholders will become more attainable, if we continue to build on the progress we have made in recent years and expand our focus beyond data and information-related issues to producing knowledge that can inform country-based interpretation and more effective and coherent narratives of national progress towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
