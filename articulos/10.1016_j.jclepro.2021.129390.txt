                  In the present study, the association of household livelihood and income inequality with sustainable food security was assessed in the rural areas. We used a cross-sectional data and quantitative analysis to follow the main goal of the study. Data were collected using a questionnaire through face-to-face interviews of a random sample of rural households. Food security status was assessed using HFIAS and FCS indexes, while household welfare was calculated by six indicators. Also, income inequality was measured using Theil, Atkinson, and FGT indexes. This study was implemented in Dowreh Chegeni county in Lorestan province in Iran. The questionnaires were completed by 201 households in the study location. The target sample consists of the households who are living permanently in the rural area. Of the total sample 40.79% were food secure, while about 13.4%, 14.4%, and 31.3% of the sampled households faced marginal, moderate, and severe food insecurity. All welfare indicators showed that degree of income inequality of the households in marginal and moderate categories was greater than other households. The results showed that household welfare is directly and significantly associated with food security. This suggests the wisdom of the government and the related organizations focusing on improving the welfare status of the households using different policies such as providing affordable houses for poor households, preparing long-term loans for the households to purchase their needed assets, and facilitating the purchase of livestock for the rural households to produce their needed foods.

Handling Editor. Mingzhou Jin In the present study, the association of household livelihood and income inequality with sustainable food security was assessed in the rural areas. We used a cross-sectional data and quantitative analysis to follow the main goal of the study. Data were collected using a questionnaire through face-to-face interviews of a random sample of rural households. Food security status was assessed using HFIAS and FCS indexes, while household welfare was calculated by six indicators. Also, income inequality was measured using Theil, Atkinson, and FGT indexes. This study was implemented in Dowreh Chegeni county in Lorestan province in Iran. The questionnaires were completed by 201 households in the study location. The target sample consists of the households who are living permanently in the rural area. Of the total sample 40.79% were food secure, while about 13.4%, 14.4%, and 31.3% of the sampled households faced marginal, moderate, and severe food insecurity. All welfare indicators showed that degree of income inequality of the households in marginal and moderate categories was greater than other households. The results showed that household welfare is directly and significantly associated with food security. This suggests the wisdom of the government and the related organizations focusing on improving the welfare status of the households using different policies such as providing affordable houses for poor households, preparing long-term loans for the households to purchase their needed assets, and facilitating the purchase of livestock for the rural households to produce their needed foods.

Food security, as introduced by the World Food Conference in 1996 and 2009, is defined when “all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life” (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 1996 ). According to this definition, four key components are: Availability, Affordability, Stability, and Utilization, which have a strong relationship with each other (Anríquez et al., 2013 ; Carletto et al., 2013 ; Hosseini et al., 2017 ; Pakravan-Charvadeh et al., 2021b ). There are different ways for improving the status of food security, including government assistance, agricultural production, emphasizing socioeconomic factors, extending infrastructure, increasing household income level and food expenditure, etc. (He et al., 2019 ; Pakravan-Charvadeh et al., 2020a , 2020b ). Improving the welfare situation and living standards of rural families are often the focus of international organizations (Ahmmadi et al., 2021 ; Pakravan-Charvadeh et al., 2021a ). The improvement of household welfare and, more generally, the alleviation of poverty, nowadays, is one of the main objectives of economic development in the world (Mahadevan and Hoang, 2016 ; Nguyen and Nguyen, 2019 ; Pakravan-Charvadeh et al., 2020a ). In the early decades of the last century, after the emergence of debate on economic and social development, and more specifically with the discussion of issues related to social welfare and social policy, household welfare has been widely considered in the literature (Basakha and Mohaqeqi Kamal, 2018 ). Welfare can be introduced as a kind of government support intended to avouch that members of a society can acquire basic human needs such as shelter and food (Mi et al., 2020 ). Numerous studies have emphasized assessing household welfare status by different methods (Table 1  ). These studies have a wide range of findings. Most of these studies contend that per capita income and food consumption expenditure share are appropriate indicator to follow the status of household welfare, while other calculated a combination indicator is more proper than a unique index to assess household welfare (Table 1 ). Others applied a binary factor to categorize households who have adequate welfare and those who do not (Wossen et al., 2019 ). Despite the possible influence of household welfare on food security in rural areas and vice-versa, few scholars have investigated these linkages in great details. To our knowledge, no study has endeavored to comprehend such an association in the world. The main question which has not been considered by these studies is if improving household welfare will ameliorate food security level. Do all welfare indicators have the same association with food security? We found only one study in which the results showed that household welfare is directly associated with food security, a study of Afghan refugees in Iran (Pakravan-Charvadeh and Mohammadi-Nasrabadi, 2020 ). The primary aim of the present study is to evaluate the association of household welfare with food security status in the rural areas. The results of the study will aid policymakers and administrations to find an appropriate welfare indicator to improve food security levels in rural areas.  2 Material and method 2.1 Study location This study was carried out in the rural area of Dowreh Chegeni (as a county of Lorestan province in Iran). The county is subdivided into three districts, including Chegeni (as a central district), Veysian, and Shahivand district, and further is segmented into six rural districts, including Veysian, Shurab, Teshkan, Dowreh, South Kashkan, and North Kashkan (Asadpourian et al., 2020 ). This county consists of 193 villages. Also, this county consists of 12000 households and about 42000 persons. Fig. 1   demonstrates the geographical map of the study location in Lorestan province.  2.2 Study population and data resources Data were collected using a questionnaire through face-to-face interviews of a random sample of rural households. The questionnaires were completed by 201 households in the study location. The target sample consists of the households who are living permanently in the rural area of Dowreh Chegeni county in Lorestan province in Iran. The questionnaires were completed by the households' breadwinners or a member who was familiar with all aspects of the household's dietary pattern and their socioeconomic and welfare status. The questionnaire included two different sections: first, standard questions to assess food security status, which was extracted from United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) entitled The Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS), and The Food Consumption Score (FCS), and second, questions which were drawn from the related studies.  2.3 Food security indicators 2.3.1 Food Consumption Score (FCS) Food security status of the target population was assessed using two leading indicators, including FCS and HFIAS. The FCS was introduced by the World Food Program as a frequency-weighted dietary diversity score (Leroy et al., 2015 ). This indicator is a composite score based on the number of consumed food groups (eight possible food groups) in the home consuming by household's members during the previous seven days, multiplied by the number of days that the food group was consumed, weighted based on the relative nutritional value of the consumed food items. The total possible score is ranging from 0 to 112. The FCS was calculated as follows: (Jones et al., 2013 ):(1) F C S = ∑ i = 1  8  α i  X i       In which, FCS is the food consumption score, a is the weight of each of the eight food groups, and X is the frequency of consumption of the food groups (equivalent to the number of days of consumption of the food group in question during the last seven days), and i shows the food group. The weights are as follows: main staples = 2, pules = 3, vegetables = 1, fruit = 1, meat and fish = 4, milk = 4, sugar = 0.5, and oil = 0.5 (Baumann et al., 2013 ). According to the cut-off points of the FCS, all households can be classified into one of the following categories, including poor (0–28), borderline (28.5–42), and acceptable (>42). Some studies reported that the FCS and household diet diversity have a close correlation with calorie intake (Maxwell et al., 2013 ; Vaitla et al., 2017 ; Wiesmann et al., 2009 ).  2.3.2 Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) A modified version of the HFIAS, a standard tool that has been validated in Iran (Rezazadeh et al., 2016 ), was applied to assess food security status. This instrument is a nine-item scale, with a reference period of the past four weeks for questions (Bhalla et al., 2018 ; Rezazadeh et al., 2016 ). In the HFIAS, households are asked to respond to each experience as never, rarely, sometimes, or often, generating a total score from 0 to 27 (Bhalla et al., 2018 ). The score of 27 indicates greater household food insecurity and vice versa. Using this method, food insecurity is categorized into three levels (i.e., marginal, moderate, and severe) which show uncertainty about the food supply, insufficient quality of food, and insufficient food quantity, respectively.   2.4 Household welfare indicators 2.4.1 Social welfare indicators A public method to measure household practically is to take a vector of household income and plug it into a welfare indicator. A more complex analysis also considers the sampling distribution of the welfare statistic stated as a function. It uses information about the sample to estimate the standard error and point estimate of welfare measurements. However, most the studies believe that this unique indicator is inadequate to assess welfare status due to multivariate distribution of incomes (Cowell et al., 2000 ). In the present study, different indicators were used to assess the status of household welfare, including per capita income, asset index, food expenditure share, livestock index, personal saving, and house ownership. Some authors claimed that household food consumption is more proper than household income when examining welfare status, because consumption is more closely correlated to household well-being (Thanh et al., 2020 ). Asset index was calculated by aggregating the value of all possessions of a household (Hossain et al., 2019 ). These properties were included municipal gas, phone, dining table, washing machine, dishwasher, furniture, laptop, air conditioner, computer, television, play station, microwave, toilet, water purifier, private swimming pool, private car, bicycle, motorcycle, camera, villa, tractor, and sprayer (Cazzuffi et al., 2020 ; Unnikrishnan and Imai, 2020 ). First, the value of all possessions was aggregated based on local currency (Cazzuffi et al., 2020 ). To calculate the livestock index, the value of all livestock and poultry was also aggregated. Reported livestock values can present valuable insights into the contribution of livestock income to the household welfare of livestock owners (Du-Pont et al., 2020 ). Also, households who had a personal saving as a wealth index were considered as households with higher welfare. Finally, households with house ownership were coded one as welfare status and otherwise 0. We used different indicators because assessing welfare level might be underestimated by using a single index.  2.4.2 Theil indicator Using the concept of entropy, Theil (1967)  developed a method for estimating income distribution inequality (Hamidi et al., 2019 ). When individual incomes are entirely or almost equal, then the income of all people will be known, but if income is unequally distributed, predicting the income of a randomly selected person will not be easy. The general form of generalized entropy measures can be presented as follows:(2) G E ( α )  = 1 α 2  − α   [ 1 n  ∑  i = 1  n  ( y i  y ‾   )  α  − 1  ]      In which, n is the number of the study households, yi  is the income of household i (i = 1, 2, …, n), and y ‾  = 1 n  ∑  i = 1  n  y i     is the arithmetic mean of households' income. The GE has ranged from 0 as equal income distribution to ∞    as absolute unequal income distribution. When α = 1   , the GE shows Theil index as follows:(3) G E ( 1 )  = 1 n  ∑  i = 1  n  y i  y ‾   l n ( y i  y ‾   )        2.4.3 FGT indicator Foster et al. (1984)  proposed a family of indicators to measure welfare. This class of FGT measures, can be defined as:(4) F ( a )  = 1 n  ∑  i = 1  q  ( Z − y i   Z  )  a  → a > 0     In which, n is the total interviewed households, Z is the poverty threshold, yi  is per capita income, and q is the number of poor households, and α > 0    is a “poverty aversion” parameter (Ogunniyi et al., 2021 ).  2.4.4 Atkinson indicator The Atkinson index is a measure of income inequality. The measure is helpful for identifying which end of the distribution contributed most to the observed inequality. The equation of the Atkinson index is given below:(5) A = 1 − 1 Y ‾   ( 1 N  ∑  i = 1  N  Y i 1 − ε    )  1 1 − ε        Where N is the number of households, Y i     is the income of household i, Y ‾     is the mean income, and ε    is an inequality aversion parameter (Latty, 2011 ). For measuring social-welfare losses from inequality, this indicator can be used as a proxy for some time. However, its utility as a proscriptive measure for policy assessment is dependent on methodologically sound and empirically accurate methods for estimating ε   .  2.4.5 Logistic regression The logistic regression model was used to determine the association of household welfare with food security status in the study location. A significance level of 0.05 was used for all factors. In the final model, only two conceivable outcomes are available, either food secure (y = 1   ) or food insecure (y = 0   ) as follows (Munshi et al., 2014 ):(6) L o g ( P i  1 − P i    )  = b 0  + b i  x i  + ε     Where Pi , as the dependent variable, is the probability of being food secure (Kharisma and Abe, 2020 ). This relation is regressed upon an entire set of determinants (xi ) that are believed to have an association with households' food security (Tang and Choy, 2000 ). The study also performed the multi-collinearity test of the independent factors. It found that all the right-hand side determinants are admissible as the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) is small well below 10 (Phoumin and Kimura, 2019 ; Wang et al., 2017 ).    3 Results 3.1 Sample description Detailed socioeconomic characteristics of the respondents are presented in Table 2  , including continuous and categorical factors. The mean income of the interviewed households was 2900000 Toman (as the local currency, which is equivalent to $130 per month). The surveyed households had an average of four members, including on average 1.4 female and 1.2 male children. The average size of the respondent households was 1.4 (SD = 1.3), and the age of the breadwinners and the mothers within the participated households were, in average, 45 (ranged between 23 and 70 years) and 42 years (ranged between 21 and 70), respectively. The households had, in average, one person employed out of home, while the average number of educated members within a household was less than one. The average age of participated households' buildings was 17 years with two rooms, in average, in their houses, and the distance their homes from the center of the nearest city ranged between 9 and 50 Km. The descriptive analysis of the categorical factors demonstrated that about 84% of the breadwinners were male, while 84% of the total respondents were married. Although most of the breadwinners of the surveyed households were employed in the private sector, about 19% of them were unemployed. About 17% of the breadwinners of the participated households had a second job, and 70% of the households had a personal house. More than half of the households had a personal saving in one of the national or private banks in Iran. The descriptive analysis demonstrated that about 22% of the respondent households participated in health programs to protect the health status of their family members. Almost 68% of the households received micro-credit funds, and more than half the breadwinners of the participated households were familiar with various social networks. Finally, 22% of the respondent households were supported by different charities.  3.2 Food security status Fig. 2   shows the food security status of the participated households in the rural areas of Dowreh Chegeni county in Lorestan province in Iran. Of the total sample 40.79% were food secure, while about 13.4%, 14.4%, and 31.3% of the sampled households faced marginal, moderate, and severe food insecurity, respectively. If we combine all food insecure categories into a unique group, about 60% of the respondent households faced different levels of food insecurity. According to the result, the participating households have an unfavorable situation of food insecurity and need urgent actions to improve their food security. The results of calculating the FCS indicator found about 38% of the participating households had acceptable food consumption, while 42% and 19% of the households were in the borderline and poor consumption categories. The FCS indicator shows that the households who were food secure and those who faced marginal food insecurity had an acceptable level of food consumption with scores of 61.6 and 48.9, respectively, while households who faced moderate food insecurity had a borderline level of food consumption (score is 39.4). Finally, severe food insecure households had a poor level of food consumption (score = 20.8).  3.3 Welfare indicators To access the status of the participating households' welfare, several indicators were applied. Firstly, we used three indicators, including The Foster–Greer–Thorbecke (FGT), Theil, and Atkinson, to calculate income inequality as the main reason for the lack of household welfare. The Atkinson index showed that the highest inequality among lower-income (ε = 0.1   ) and higher-income (ε = 0.9   ) households are the households who faced marginal and moderate food insecurity. The income inequality of higher-income classes was greater than the lower-income classes. The Theil indicator demonstrated that income inequality among households who face marginal and moderate food insecurity is greater than other households, including food secure and severe food insecure categories. The FGT indicator also showed that degree of income inequality of the households in marginal and moderate categories was greater than other households. Table 3   reports that the food expenditure share of food secure households is more than food insecure households. Based on Fig. 3  , other household welfare indicators, including asset and livestock indexes, showed that the level of household welfare decreased from food secure to severe food insecure situation. More asset and livestock value is related to food-secure household, while the lowest value is related to the severe households. Also, Fig. 4   demonstrates that the income level of food secure households is greater than other households who faced different levels of food insecurity. In fact, with increasing the level of households' income, the food insecurity situation is getting better. To achieve more confident results, two binary factors, including personal savings and a private house, were used to assess household welfare level. Fig. 5   illustrates that the increase of food insecurity level is accompanied by decreasing households who have personal savings and house ownership. 3.3.1 Quantitative analysis Table 2  reports the results of the estimation of logistic regression models to identify the association of socioeconomic and household welfare indicators with food security status. We distinguished all models based on the welfare indicators. Per capita income, household asset indicator, food expenditure share, livestock indicator, personal saving, and house ownership status were considered as household welfare indicators. In all models, the dependent factor is the status of food security, including two categories: 1 for food-secure household and 0 for food-insecure household. Before the estimation of the models, the multi-collinearity test of the independent factors was performed, and it corroborated that all the right-hand side factors were acceptable as the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) was less than 10 (see Table 4  ). According to Table 4 , some factors, including breadwinner's age, having a second job, mortgage, and accessing micro-credit funds had a significantly positive association with households' food security in all models, while the distance from downtown was indirectly associated with food security. Breadwinner educational level, number of female children, mother's age, and house size were significantly associated with food security in none of the models. Considering household welfare indicators, home ownership, and personal savings had the greatest degree of the association with food security among rural households in the study location. In contrast, per capita income and food expenditure share had the lowest degree of association. Household welfare indicators are significantly and positively associated with household food security in rural areas. This may be related to the low and near levels of income among severe food insecure households, which lead to slight differences in income inequality.    4 Discussion In the present study, we answered the main question, Is there any association between household welfare status and food security in rural areas? In the first step, the status of household food security was assessed in the study area using two different indicators, including HFIAS and FCS. About 60% of the rural households faced distinct food insecurity levels. This high level of food insecurity is greater than the average level of food insecurity in the province, which has been reported in other studies (Pakravan-Charvadeh et al., 2020a ). Households with a higher level of food insecurity had a lower level of food consumption. Accessing food is the main obstacle of these households increasing their food security. The combined indicator showed that there is more minor error in assessing food security in this area (Maxwell et al., 2013 ). All inequality indicators which can be used for following the status of household welfare (Bakkeli, 2016 ; Hu et al., 2020 ) showed that income inequality among households who face marginal and moderate food insecurity was more than others. Income distribution policies may be efficacious to ameliorate the status of food security in marginal and moderate groups compared to other categories, including food-secure and severe food-insecure level. Household income level, as a household welfare indicator, was directly and significantly associated with food security, as other studies contended (Hosseini et al., 2017 ; Pakravan-Charvadeh et al., 2020b , 2021a ). Increasing income levels may enhance the potential of households to prepare their needed foodstuffs and improve their food access, a critical dimensions of food security (Savari et al., 2020 ). Although the quantitative analysis presented, due to a small coefficient of income, income policies cannot be used as a target policy to improve the status of the food security for all the households, only those who face marginal and moderate food insecurity may benefit from implementing such policies. The results showed that asset and livestock indicators as welfare indexes were significantly and directly associated with rural households' food security in the study area. Livestock usually is identified as households' investment to produce their needed foods and helps them to save a part of their money and allocate to other needs (Du-Pont et al., 2020 ; Savari and Zhoolideh, 2021 ). Also, households can sell the livestock when they need more money for livelihood (Gholamrezai et al., 2021 ). Accessing more welfare assets will provide more comforts for the households and may decrease household anxiety and uncertainty. Wealthier households are likely to have more available resources for purchasing needed food and can exchange or sell physical capital for acquiring foodstuffs (Kirkland et al., 2013 ; Nawrotzki et al., 2014 ). Having a personal saving as a welfare indicator was directly associated with household food security, as this saving may decrease house stress, which is one of the main reasons of prevailing food insecurity (Darmon and Drewnowski, 2015 ; Nunnery and Dharod, 2017 ; Peterman et al., 2013 ). Fear of financial stressors and instability of economic condition encourage households to have precautionary saving. According to Iranian banking laws, households with savings can earn interest as an auxiliary source of income, which can help them to purchase their necessities. This condition can provide a much-needed opportunity for households to improve the quality of their lives. Considering house ownership as a welfare index, households with a personal house are less exposed to food insecurity in the study area. This association can be interpreted from two distinct aspects; reducing household expenditure and decreasing household stress regarding access to shelter. Households with a personal house need not pay any money to rent a house and then, they have more money to prepare their needed foodstuff. So, this condition will provide an abundant opportunity for them to save their money and invest in other activities (Bulawayo et al., 2019 ). On the other hand, one of the most stressful activities of households in Iran is providing shelter for their families, which may eventually lead to increasing the risk of food insecurity (Koh et al., 2018 ; Masa et al., 2018 ; Pakravan-Charvadeh et al., 2020b ). Overall, the results showed that household welfare is directly associated with food security in a rural area. Comparison of all welfare indicators suggested that house ownership and personal savings had the greatest degree of association with food security, while per capita income had the lowest degree. This may be related to the high cost of renting a house in Iran, which impose arduous obstacles on the households without a personal house (Pakravan-Charvadeh et al., 2020a , 2020b , 2020b ). Breadwinners' second job was directly and significantly associated with food security in all models. Due to unfavorable economic conditions in Iran, most of the breadwinners cannot earn the needed money for supporting their families with a single employment, and therefore, are forced to work long hours often must find a second job (Ruben and Van den berg, 2001 ). Having a second job contributes breadwinner to earn more money for providing more comfort for their family, as more foods can be purchased, leading to improved food security status (Babatunde and Qaim, 2010 ; Waha et al., 2018 ). The results confirmed that the older the breadwinner, the higher the food security in all models. Overtime, the breadwinner can gain more experience, especially in providing food ingredients, and they have adequate familiarity with different aspects of providing foods, such as which foods are healthy, or which food can be purchased at lower cost. All of these conditions enable breadwinners to take steps to improve the living standards and food security of the family (Abdullah, 2018 ; Magaña-Lemus et al., 2016 ; Oduniyi and Tekana, 2020 ; Pakravan-Charvadeh et al., 2020a ). Distance from the downtown for purchasing the groceries had inversely and significantly association with food security in the rural area. The greater distance from the markets where most groceries are purchased may lead to lose the chance of accessing fresh, adequate, and on time foods (Liu et al., 2021 ; Sharkey et al., 2011 ). If food sources are depleted, they may need more time to provide enough food ingredients. This condition may deal a severe blow to food availability and, finally, the status of food security, because food availability is identified as one of the most indispensable dimensions of food security in the world (Asfawa et al., 2017 ). Accessing micro-credit funds was positively and significantly associated with food security in the study location. Households who have access to micro credit may have more potential to purchase and prepare their needed foods and improve the quality of their meal and their consumption pattern diversity by adding healthier foods, which are often more expensive compared to their routine diets (Asfawa et al., 2017 ). Micro credit can also contribute households to gain greater caloric intake via larger meal portions or additional meals (Asfawa et al., 2017 ).  5 Limitations This study has several limitations. First, this study does not allow to draw causality because of the cross-sectional design. Second, the data was collected through a face-to-face interview which have its own limitations during COVID-19 including the risk of the disease for interviewers, social isolation, the obstacles of traffic restrictions, and the fear of respondents to answer the questions. Therefore, our results are affected by this limitation.  6 Conclusion Household welfare status was directly and significantly associated with food security in rural areas. This suggests the wisdom of the government and the related organizations focusing on improving the welfare status of the households using different policies such as providing affordable houses for poor households, preparing long-term loans for the households to purchase their needed assets, facilitating the purchase of livestock for the rural households to produce their needed foods, and giving food packages to support the poor households. Although the results confirmed that income policies are not useable to improve the status of food security due to the small degree of association between income and food security, this policy only should be used in marginal and moderate food insecure households because of the greater income inequality among these households. Overall, any policy adopted to increase the household welfare will lead to improving the status of food security level. It can be suggested the government target one of them to improve the quality of life: improving food security directly or increasing households' welfare which leads to improving the status of food security. Future studies can apply state-of-the-art statistical techniques such as multinomial logit regression to prove the same association in different categories of food security in other locations in the world. Using different food security and household welfare indicators can also contribute scholars to extract accurate results in the future studies.  Funding There is no fund.
