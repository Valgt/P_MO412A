                  Libraries have a significant impact in the attainment of the SDGs. They are considered worldwide as the most reliable information center that acquires processes, organizes stores, retrieves and disseminates information to users. In this context, the study investigates the role of academic libraries in realizing sustainable development goals, with a specific case study on the Mohamed Sekkat University Library and its contribution to the Global Goals for Sustainable Development by the United Nations (SDGs). The paper centers on how this Moroccan library has incorporated the SDGs into its resources, activities, programs, and projects.

According to [1] Libraries and education are the panacea  for the sustainable development of any nation. Likewise, [2] affirms the pivotal role that libraries play in attaining  the Sustainable Development Goals. Moreover, the Sustainable Development Agenda for 2030 by the United  Nations delineates 17 goals [3], constituting an inclusive plan addressing peace, prosperity, people, and the planet.  These objectives cover economic, environmental, and social aspects [4]. Acknowledging the transformative  influence of information and communication technologies (ICT), the International Federation of Library  Associations and Institutions (IFLA) firmly asserts that improving access to information and knowledge is  instrumental in fostering sustainable development and improving the overall quality of life.    Numerous research studies have investigated the perspectives of librarians on the Sustainable Development Goals  (SDGs). For instance, [5] explores the views of South Korean librarians on the SDGs and their strategies for  supporting libraries. Authors in [6] analyze the contribution of libraries open to the public in Cameroon to SDG 16,  with a focus on peace, justice, and strong institutions. University libraries, as mentioned in [7], have undertaken  initiatives to document and plan their contributions to the SDGs, involving the creation of evaluation frameworks  and performance metrics.    The selection of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals resulted from a global consultation process in 2015,  building on the achievements of the objectives set by the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) between 2000  and 2015. These goals encompass a wide range of objectives, including:  â€¢ Goal1: Alleviate Poverty  â€¢ Goal 2: Eliminate Hunger   â€¢ Goal 3 : Promote Good Health &amp; Well-being   â€¢ Goal 4 : Ensure Quality Education  â€¢ Goal 5 : Attain Gender Equality   â€¢ Goal 6 : Puter Water &amp; Sanitation   â€¢ Goal 7 : Promote Affordable and Clean Energy  â€¢ Goal 8 : Encourage Decent Work and Economic Growth  â€¢ Goal 9 : Advancing Industry, Promoting Innovation, and Developing Infrastructure  â€¢ Goal 10 : Minimize Disparities  â€¢ Goal 11 : Build Sustainable Urban Development  â€¢ Goal 12 : Encourage Responsible Consumption  â€¢ Goal 13 : Take Action on Climate  â€¢ Goal 14 : Preserve Life Below Water  â€¢ Goal 15 : Preservation of Terrestrial Ecosystems  â€¢ Goal 16 : Promote Peace and Justice  â€¢ Goal 17 : Collaborative Efforts for Achieving Objectives  2. Academic libraries' contribution to achieve the SDGs  Academic libraries are instrumental in advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Primarily, they  participate to education by providing valuable and reliable information resources. Additionally, libraries actively  engage in health literacy programs. Notably, the Chinese University of Hong Kong Library has partnered with  different university units to design initiatives and programs aimed at promoting good health and wellness [8].  Libraries provide publications of past research results that serve as references for other researchers. The University  of Cambridge, in collaboration between the Library and the Office of Research Strategy, implemented an open  access policy and practice. This initiative enables the repository to host the research output of university members  [9].    Libraries constitute a fundamental component within the economic, social, and educational fabric of nations.  They support gender, racial and ethical groups.   The Ghana Central Library [10] has introduced a training program aimed at equipping students with fundamental  ICT skills, encouraging their regular use of computers in daily tasks. Libraries play a crucial role in addressing  568 Khalid Lahyani  et al. / Procedia Computer Science 236 (2024) 566â€“573  Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000  3  gender disparities and combatting violence and sexual harassment within the university setting through diverse  activities, including conferences, seminars, and awareness campaigns. The study [11] underscored the role of  academic libraries in South Africa in supporting SDG 5, emphasizing equality between genders. This is achieved  through a range of community engagement (CE) initiatives. Libraries contribute to the preservation of cultural and  natural heritage, archiving and protection of knowledge. In 2019, the Australian National University Library  accomplished the digitization of all research theses available at ANU from 1954 to 2018 [4]. Libraries provide  access to information about sustainable consumption and environmental conservation through a variety of resources,  services, and programs. The University in the State of Michigan (MSU) has adopted sustainable practices in its  libraries, including initiatives focused on recycling and waste management [12]. Kynea has initiated the Green  Library Initiative [13] as part of their commitment to environmental conservation.Libraries offer their communities  collections that encompass heritage, law, conflict resolution, and regulations to advocate for peace, equity, and  robust institutions. In Cameroon [6], libraries that are open to the public actively participate in promoting peace and  justice, occasionally serving as mediators in resolving specific social conflicts.  3. Mohamed Sekkat University Library contribution to the SDGs  The Mohamed Sekkat University Library is the result of a partnership between Hassan II University of  Casablanca and the Sekkat Foundation.  Located in the heart of the university campus, the library is an institution  that works for the development of training and research through its documentary and informational offer and its  services oriented towards the academic and scientific environment. The library's collections are multidisciplinary  and offer a diversity of languages and media, making it a modern library that keeps pace with the developments of  the new knowledge society. Books, databases, multimedia and manuscripts are all part of a collection that reflects  the image of this distinguished institution. Today, the library serves a student population of nearly 140,587 students  from the 18 institutions of the Hassan II University of Casablanca. In addition, the library does not exclude the  "general public" category to the delight of book lovers. The diversified and very welcoming spaces of the library  favor the organization of scientific events and cultural meetings of great scope. The library's audiences follow this  programming on the library's portal, its social networks and its monthly newsletters.  4. Research Questions  The main aim of this research is to explore the role of academic libraries in advancing sustainable development  goals. The research will address the following questions:  â€¢ How do public libraries participate to the achievement of SDGs?  â€¢ What specific initiatives has the Mohamed Sekkat University Library undertaken in support of these  goals?  â€¢ What suggestions or feedback can be provided to enhance the library's role in furthering the SDGs at  Mohamed Sekkat University?  5. Methodology  This study utilized both an exploratory approach and a case study design, focusing on the Mohamed Sekkat  University Library. Content analysis and surveys served as the adopted instruments for data collection.    5.1 Survey Design    We administered a questionnaire to university professors, students, and the general public.

Conclusion  The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) established by the United Nations provide a new framework for  assessing the role of libraries. In this context, this study analyzes the nature of the main activities of academic  libraries in light of the SDG methodology by identifying the different services provided including access to  collections, exhibitions and public events. Academic libraries contribute significantly to sustainability through  various avenues such as digital initiatives, resource management, and technological innovations. Digital initiatives,  including the digitization of resources and the implementation of online platforms, reduce the need for physical  materials, ultimately minimizing the library's environmental footprint. Efficient resource management practices,  such as energy-efficient systems and waste reduction measures, further align the library with sustainable principles.  The Mohamed Sekkat University Library provides innovative services that assist students, teachers,  administrative staff and the general public and itâ€™s a part of the several other university libraries that contribute to  achieve the sustainable development goals.
