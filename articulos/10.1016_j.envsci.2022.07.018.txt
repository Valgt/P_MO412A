                  Thailand is a worldwide hub for the value addition of gemstones. Women in Thailand enjoy a high level of education, their employment level is on par with other member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and they play a significant role in the gem and jewellery industry. Thai institutions support the industry, but their gender-neutral stance does not celebrate, or capitalise on, the contribution of female actors. Patriarchy and ‘invisible masculinity’ underlie entrepreneurship across the country. A few privileged women have experienced a degree of empowerment and fair conditions at work. But some parts of the industry, for example, home-based work, are informal and women in the home-based gemstone-cutting industry in the border regions, hit particularly hard by COVID-19, have experienced little progress. The literature has not paid much attention to the Thai gem resource sector or to the contribution of women. This paper considers the gem and jewellery industry’s contribution to the lives of women in Thailand referencing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)—gender equality and empowerment (SDG 5), decent work and economic work (SDG 8), and reduced inequalities (SDG 10). The paper is based on seven years of research into the opportunities and challenges for women in the gemstone value chain spanning Madagascar and Thailand. The paper questions the extent to which the industry has enabled and empowered women in Thailand, and whether it perpetuates some of the patterns of economic inequality reflected in, and caused by, the urban–rural divide.

Keywords Thailand  Gem and jewellery  Gender  SDGs    1 Introduction Jewellery industry bodies—such as the Responsible Jewellery Council (RJC) and Jewelers of America have espoused the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Such industry bodies support the establishment of an SDG task force, the setting of development objectives, and they conduct workshops on gender equality in the jewellery and watch industries (Responsible Jewellery Council, 2019 ). Women are the primary consumers of jewellery, but the industry is male dominated; and while women contribute their labour along the gemstone and jewellery supply and value chains, they are over-represented in vulnerable and informal contexts in the jewellery industry and under-represented in positions of leadership (Responsible Jewellery Council, 2021 ). However, little research has been conducted into the lived experiences of vulnerable women along the value chain or into Thailand’s resource sector. This research, conducted over seven years in Madagascar, a gemstone-producing nation, and in Thailand, a hub for processing and trading gemstones (Lawson, 2018, 2019, 2020 ), addresses some of the challenges and opportunities for women in the gem and jewellery industry. This paper examines the extent to which women’s participation in the industry in Thailand has facilitated progress in meeting the SDGs of gender equality (SDG 5), decent work and economic work (SDG 8), and reduced inequalities (SDG 10). To situate this discussion, the authors begin by providing a critical discussion of some recent literature about the SDGs in relation to gender and artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM). Context is then provided through an overview of Thailand, its political economy, societal trends, and its resource sector. The paper then considers how women participate in three specific parts of the gem and jewellery value chain: cutting and polishing, business and trade, academic gemmology and whether their work contributes towards meeting the targets of SDGs 5, 8, and 10. It is argued that while a few privileged women have experienced some degree of empowerment and fair conditions at work, little progress has taken place for rural women, particularly those working in the home-based gemstone-cutting industry in the border regions which have been hit hard by COVID-19. The industry perpetuates some of the patterns of economic inequality reflected in, and caused by, the Thai urban–rural divide. Parts of the industry are informal, some of the work is home-based, and an ‘invisible masculinity’ (Ahl, 2006 ) prevails in entrepreneurship across the country: even educated women face the underlying impacts of patriarchy and vulnerabilities in factory and home-based work. On the one hand, Thai institutions support the gem and jewellery industry in significant ways but, on the other hand, their gender-neutral stance fails to celebrate, and capitalise on, the contributions of female actors. Industry has empowered women, but the extent of the empowerment is limited.   2 Gender, artisanal and small-scale mining and the SDGs There is an increasing policy focus on gender and mining issues, and the SDGs are one very specific and important part of that (Buss et al., 2021 ). Any discursive inclusion of women within a policy framework, however, takes place within a specific power relationship (Bedford, 2009 ). Women’s inclusion in an ASM site happens within a highly gendered context where women’s roles as mothers and care givers (an unpaid domestic realm of work) are reified more than their economic capability as an earning family member. These kinds of discourse and practice can minimise the importance of ASM for the livelihoods and economic empowerment of women and as Buss et al. (2021)  point out, most ASM activities, renumerate women far better than any alternative employment (Buss et al., 2021 ). The SDGs have in fact been silent on the contribution of mining to sustainable development and to address this, in 2016, the UNDP (UNDP, 2016 ) launched a roadmap for connecting mining to the SDGs, with a focus on large-scale mining (LSM). This roadmap paid little attention to the incorporation of ASM and how ASM might progress certain SDGs. Recent literature provides a nuanced appraisal of the way in which ASM, and the SDGs are interconnected and also raises a number of caveats that must be considered when mapping the SDGs and ASM. Certainly, ASM is directly linked with many SDG goals, for example through its important contribution to poverty reduction (SDG 1), food availability (SDG 2), gender equality (SDG 5), and decent work and economic growth (SDG 8) (Hilson & Maconachie, 2020 ). However, Hirons (2020) , argues that the ASM sector is connected to all the SDGs in ways which both support and undermine their achievement. He argues that the SDGs might have more negative than positive implications for ASM given the SDGs’ inherent and implicit bias towards business and the perpetuation of LSM. The SDG’s focus on measuring impact rather than systems of governance might add to the further marginalization of the ASM sector which is often found in the informal sector. Considering the Myanmar context, Sadan and Lawn Dan (2021)  argue that a focus on the governance of LSM, for example through the Extractive Industry Transparency Index, has led to the oversight of the contributions and lessons that can be learned from ASM. They strongly encourage a rethink of the gendered roles in traditional ASM in Myanmar where women’s involvement is not only about the very important concern of sex-trafficking and exploitation of women and girls, but also about how ASM affects lives and livelihoods. They argue in the case of jade (jadeite) mining in Myanmar's Kachin inhabited area that, while the ASM sites cannot be considered as areas amenable to broad access for women, there is strong evidence from local narratives that ASM has enabled women to participate in the economic lives of the mines and develop important roles in the local jade trade, as brokers, dealers, and cooperative based money lenders. Due to the long-term conflict and the limited mobility of men, women have acquired more power within the system, particularly elderly women, who are less likely to be subject to gender-based violence. While not overlooking ASM’s negative impacts on SDGs related to water and the environment, the authors believe that the ASM of jade in Myanmar has contributed substantially towards SDG 8 and SDG 5. Certainly, ASM can have both positive and negative impacts in relation to the SDG goals. As Maconachie and Conteh (2021)  demonstrate in the case of ASM in the diamond sector of Sierra Leone, cronyism involving the local customary leaders and national politicians is found to be an obstacle to attaining the SDG targets, including environmental goals. Laing and Moonsammy (2021)  with the case of Guyana argue, that ASM contributes significantly to reducing poverty and achieving economic growth-related SDG targets, although this can be at a significant social and environmental cost. Buss et al. (2021)  conclude, that overall the SDGs go further than the Millennium Development Goals in increasing the inclusion of women in various decision-making processes and in accessing resources. However, the SDGs may favour limited economic arguments around the inclusion of women in ASM without adequately accounting for various structural factors that limit their capacity to compete with men on equal ground. They emphasize that women’s "financial autonomy" should be the focus for projects in the ASM sector that align with the SDGs (p. 35). Hilson and Maconachie (2020)  argue that a bottom-up approach to understanding women’s labour in ASM is needed to understand the various heterogeneities of the labour force and gendered labour roles. The formalisation of ASM is one of the most significant policy issues facing the sector, and as Hirons (2020)  points out, its implementation will stretch beyond the lifespan of the SDGs. Successful formalisation can be seen as contributing to the achievement of some of the SDGs. For example, aspects of the policy for the formalisation of ASM gold in Tanzania align to the SDGs concerned with environmental impacts (Kinyondo and Huggins, 2021 ). The formalisation of ASM has generated considerable economic benefits by creating employment opportunities directly and indirectly in downstream and upstream industries, these generate outcomes which speak directly to the SDGs, especially food security and gender equality (Hilson and Maconachie, 2020 ). Income earned by women from ASM is generally invested in household expenses, children’s education, family farms, and improving local food security (Buss et al., 2021 ). This contributes to the overall well-being and sustainability of households thus addressing many of the SDGs. More broadly however the SDGS will be unlikely to help frame the complex issues which must be addressed in order to bring about widespread formalisation or to develop other appropriate forms of governance. An uncritical application of the SDGs to ASM may. promote an approach to formalisation that risks marginalising the poorest and entrenching inequality, and privilege techno-scientific knowledge at the expense of studies which examine the governance systems that actually dictate who, where, how and why people engage with ASM, knowledge that is essential for effective policy design (Hirons, 2020 , p. 321).   A key challenge for the sustainability of the ASM sector is whether it has the capacity to generate inter-generational relief from poverty from essentially non-renewable resources. It is critical to understand and plan for livelihood diversification and an exit strategy in the event of the exhaustion of minerals. For example, in the case of the ASM of gold in Tanzania, there has been diversification of investments into alternative livelihoods such as land, transport, commerce, tailoring, and mechanics (Pedersen et al., 2021 ). This dimension is very important for Thailand where most gem resources were exhausted in the late 90’s and where diversification of livelihoods and impressive gem value addition has been achieved in a sustainable manner (Roy Chowdhury & Abid, 2018 ).  3 Background to Thailand Thailand is a Buddhist country with a strong hereditary monarchy and high levels of education (Sustainable Development Dashboard, 2021 ). With a population of 69.6 million, it is the second largest economy in ASEAN. Thailand has grown its economy principally through services industries, construction, agriculture, forestry, fishing, and light manufacturing (work with metals, gems, and jewellery total 6 per cent of value added) (OECD, 2020 ). Since the 1980 s, the economic growth regimes have become increasingly exclusive, and dominated by Sino-Thai families based in the capital (Kanchoochat et al., 2021 ). The state, or crown, owns large companies—such as Siam Commercial Bank and Siam Cement Group, (Australian Financial Review (AFR), 2020 ). Thailand has reduced its overall poverty rate from over 65 per cent in 1988 to under 10 per cent in 2018 (World Bank, 2020a, 2020b ) but this success has stalled recently (World Bank, 2020a, 2020b ). Poor people, particularly the rural poor, are becoming poorer: the bottom 40 per cent experienced negative growth in consumption and income growth between 2015 and 2017 (World Bank, 2020a, 2020b ). Social inequality is persistent in Thailand and the differences in wealth between rural areas, such as regions in the north and south, and urban areas, are extreme. There, poverty and education intersect with ‘increased poverty experienced almost exclusively by household heads with low education levels’ (World Bank, 2020a, 2020b , p. 15, 28). Agricultural work is inequitable: agriculture represents 31 per cent of overall employment but contributes only 8 per cent to the economy (World Bank, 2019 ). Poverty and marked inequality have fuelled political instability and divisions in Thailand as evidenced by the anger of the red shirt movement and the slow burn civil war that engulfed Thailand in 2010 (Montesano et al., 2012 ). The anger against regional inequality and the elite capture of wealth underlie the ongoing youth protests against the monarchy and lèse-majesté  (Alexander, 2021 ). Gender relations reflect these patterns of inequality. The participation of women in the workforce is high, (59 per cent) and comparable to other ASEAN partners, apart from Vietnam (73 per cent) (World Bank, 202c). But women’s work does not always receive the recognition it deserves, especially because many women carry the double burden of economic activity and reproductive and domestic work. This is particularly the case for the ‘invisible’ production work of many thousands of home workers (Intaratat, 2016 ). Women migrate from the poor rural north-east to work at factories and as domestic labour, and as staff at tourist destinations, at urban centres (Mills, 1999 ). They are not educated and they work in precarious conditions for poor pay (see  Fig. 1 ). Gender inequality impacts, and is experienced, differentially despite the success at the elite level (ASEAN, 2021 ). Among the Southeast Asian countries on which data is available, Thai women had the highest percentage of women CEOs (14 per cent) in 2019 (Emelianova & Milhomem, 2019 ). But workplace harassment is widespread, along with reports of pressure to trade sexual favours for career advancement opportunities (OECD, 2019). Women experience gender discrimination and gender-based violence: 44 per cent of women in Thailand, compared to to 25 percent across Southeast Asia, have suffered physical and or sexual violence from an intimate partner at least once in their lifetime (ASEAN, 2021 ). Human trafficking and the commercial sex trade continue, and women and girls are coerced into sex work (OECD, 2019a ). The distribution of opportunity across the economy is unequal, and women from poorer rural areas and ethnic minorities experience several disadvantages, especially in relation to SDGs 5 and 8 (Fig. 1 ). Thailand has high rates of overall literacy (93 per cent)yet, only 25 per cent of domestic workers (most are from rural areas) in Bangkok are literate, and some have no education at all (WIEGO Women in Informal Employment Globalising and Organising, 2019 ).  4 Cross-cutting disadvantage of informality in home-based work Another cross-cutting disadvantage for women is the high level of informality in the Thai workforce, particularly in home-based work. Of the 10 per cent of the workforce that relies on home-based work, 70 percent are women; they are not protected by health and safety regulations or eligible for workers’ compensation (Poonsab et al., 2019 ). Home-based work has permitted many women to earn an income, albeit precarious, but it has also blurred the boundary between commercial production in factories and farms and social reproduction within households (Barrientos, 2019 ). Women work long hours to do their reproductive work and also fulfil exacting orders within short periods of time without any regulation or insurance. During the COVID-19 lockdown, Thai home-based women workers made less than 10 per cent of their pre-pandemic earnings (Women in Informal Employment Globalising and Organising, 2021 ). The pandemic highlighted the need to ensure that health insurance systems cover the large informal sector in Thailand at all times, not only during crises (World Bank, 2021a, 2021b, 2021c ). This is particularly true in the Thai gemstone industry, where many cutters and polishers work in the informal sector and at home.  5 The minerals sector in Thailand Bronze was deployed and its social impact [can be seen] from the late Neolithic communities that first encountered metal in the civilization of Angkor. ( Higham et al., 2020 , p 1).  Thailand is expected to be slow in developing untapped mineral deposits in the Mekong area owing to the risk of political uprising and delays, cancellation of infrastructure projects, and resource nationalism sentiment. (USGS, 201, 30.3).  Metals have been mined and processed in Thailand for at least 4000 years. The Khao Wong Prachan Valley of central Thailand is one of four known prehistoric loci in Southeast Asia for mining, smelting, and casting copper (Higham et al., 2020 ). The countries of the Mekong region of Southeast Asia Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, and Myanmar have rich mineral deposits of gold, copper, iron ore, bauxite, lead, tin, tungsten, manganese, and zinc (Fitch, 2018 ). Thailand is a major producer of feldspar (5.6 per cent of the world’s total), gypsum (6.0 per cent), and rare earths (sixth-ranked producer, with about 1 per cent of the world’s total). The country holds 3.6 per cent of the world’s tin reserves (USGS, 18, 2017 ). Thailand, thus, has considerable potential in mining, but political turbulence and resource nationalism have constrained this potential (Fitch, 2018 ). The number employed in mining has always been smaller than in manufacturing. Since 2017, however, the growth rate of the mining and quarrying sector has fallen 6 per cent. That is because Thailand suspended the large-scale production of gold and silver ostensibly because the local communities protested that the mining activity of Kingsgate Consolidated Ltd., an Australian mining company, was spoiling the quality of the water, and new laws were enacted to restrict the corporate use of agricultural land and to curb the negative effects of mining on the environment and health (Fitch, 2018 ).  6 Industrial mineral production Thailand Smelting & Refining Co. Ltd. (Thaisarco), a subsidiary of Amalgamated Metal Corp. Plc. (AMC) of the UK was a leading manufacturer of tin, specialty tin alloys, and other tin-related production in 2017. The production of tin and tungsten has been growing (USGS, 2017). Thailand produces a variety of industrial minerals: calcite, cement, clay, fluorspar, perlite, phosphate rock, quartz, salt, sand and gravel (construction and industrial), and stone (crushed and dimension). The production of sand and gravel (industrial), marble (dimension), feldspar, and ball clay has increased 15 per cent. The production of quartz to supply manufacture of solar panels grew three times in 2017 (USGS, 2017). Thailand’s cement industry is vast and mature and the country is one of the world’s leading producers and exporters of cement. The industry needs the production of crushed marble, shale for cement, and gypsum to increase. Siam Cement Group, one of Thailand's oldest and wealthiest industrial entities, sees bright prospects for growth beyond its home market within South-East Asia, particularly in Vietnam, even after the impact of COVID-19 (Asia Nikkei, 2021 ).  7 Artisanal and small-scale mining Historically, in Thailand, artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) of gold and silver has been important, but its current scale is much smaller than in other ASEAN member states. Rural Thai work in the small-scale mining and quarrying of salt, stone, gold, and tin was usually a seasonal activity alongside agriculture, reported Phitaks Ratanajaruraks (2006)  for the World Bank Communities and Small-scale Mining (CASM) initiative, Asia. Little has been published on ASM in Thailand since then, though it is likely that several minerals are mined on a medium scale and in a semi-mechanised manner, and recent reports found that those formerly employed in the tourism sector now earn their livelihood from small-scale gold mining. The revival of ancestral ASM gold panning demonstrates the versatility of ASM, and the only businesses open at once-popular adventure tourism locations, are the gold-dealers’ shops (France, 2021 ). Before COVID 19, Phrae in the north, had a thriving gem and geo tourism business which was led by the Thammasat University doctoral students and included outreach to schools, lapidary, and local silver smithing (Thammasat University, academic personal communication, 2018). The small and medium scale mining of gemstones in Phrae, Kanchanaburi and close to the Khmer border has slowed or been depleted. Yet the lasting legacy of gemstone mining in Thailand can be seen in the way Thai craftsmen and business have leveraged natural resources to grow an extraordinarily successful global gem and jewellery hub.  8 The Thai gem and jewellery industry The concerted private-public efforts, in the first instance to promote [the gem and jewellery industry] internationally on the basis of cheap labor, and then in the second instance to leverage the industry into a developmental pathway characterized by rising skills and product quality, has created notably high rates of growth (Scott, 1995p.261).    Thailand has been at the heart of the gem and jewellery trade for centuries with corundum deposits reported as early as the 15th century (Hughes, 2017 ). It is located between two major producers of fine gems Myanmar (rubies) and Cambodia (sapphires). Shifting borders with Cambodia and Myanmar along with mines within their own borders, provided Thailand with raw material to build its industry. Today it is a clearing house for gems from all over the world including a large diaspora of Guinean gem traders located in the capital and the gem city of Chanthaburi (Hunter and Lawson, 2020 ). Thailand has learned how to create wealth from gemstones through its development of heat treatments which enhance the colour and brightness of natural gemstones and through long traditional apprenticeships in fine cutting, polishing, gold smithing and jewellery making which have created hundreds of successful businesses large and small. Thailand has at least 10,000 skilful gemstone cutters and is the world’s third largest coloured gemstone exporter (Yan, 2021 ). The Thai gem and jewellery industry has received extensive and strategic institutional support though the creation of university study in gems and jewellery (Lawson, 2019 ), the Gem and Jewelry Institute of Thailand (GIT) and business and financial support from the Thai Board of Investment and the Office of the National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC Office of the National Economic and Social Development Council, 2021 ). Foreign investment is encouraged into trade parks and gem jewellery precincts and special economic zones located near borders with Myanmar and Cambodia. Despite setbacks from Covid 19, the industry is seeking to consolidate its position as a global gemstone and jewellery hub. Industry is using the downturn to build confidence in the quality of Thai products through certification and the promotion of a global gem festival in Chanthaburi (Sakuntanaga in Yan, 2021 ). An overview of the gemstone and jewellery value chain in Thailand is given in  Fig. 2 .  The following section will examine whether the industry has provided enabling opportunities for Thai women by considering three activities in the Thai gem and jewellery value chain: women cutters and goldsmiths, women in gem and jewellery businesses and women in the university sector. We shall consider three SDGs: gender equality (SDG 5) decent work and economic growth (SDG 8) and reduced inequalities (SDG10), within Thailand. 8.1 Gender analysis of value chains While attention has been drawn to the importance of gender in mineral value chains in international fora (OECD, 2019b ), this has been an under-theorised area. In this paper, this lacuna has been addressed by highlighting the relevance of the research and theory on gender in global value chains generated by Barrientos (2019)  to the study of women in mineral value chains. Much can be learned from the experience of women’s empowerment in other rural value chains (Barrientos, 2014, 2019 ) particularly the way in which formalisation and mechanisation have not automatically led to social upgrading. Barrientos (2019)  asks critical questions about whether participation in global value chains is really a bearer of gender transformation and opportunity or if engagement in certain value chains (for example in retail) generates new forms of exploitation and gender inequalities and all too often perpetuates and further embeds existing power relations. She has formulated the notion of the Global (re)Production Network or G(r)PN which recognises the way local context embeds gender norms and controls opportunities for women’s social and economic upgrading and labour conditions and the unpaid ‘r’ of women’s reproductive work. This is helpful in understanding the blurring of boundaries between work that occurs in the home and the factory and the reasons why highly competent Thai women do not have the time and confidence to pursue entrepreneurial activities. Similarly, Rai et al. (2019)  draw attention to gendered gaps in the SDGs and in particular SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth). They argue that the SDG’s narrow focus on Gross Domestic Product, the monetary measure of market value, and its failure to include the value and costs of social reproduction, put SDG 8 at odds with SDG 5’s call for state actors “to recognise and value unpaid work of the value of unpaid care” (Target 5.4). SDG 8 thus has missed an opportunity to provide a more sustainable and equitable approach to understanding and valuing the work of women and men that is informal and not remunerated financially. In this paper, the concept of ‘invisible masculinity’ (Ahl, 2006 ) is referenced particularly in relation to entrepreneurship. Ahl argues that entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship are too often considered as male-gendered concepts, with masculine connotations. Female entrepreneurs can thus find themselves structurally excluded from business, not in any legal sense but because “masculinity is taken for granted… [as] the assumed norm.” (Salzinger, 2004 ). In the Thai context, the notion of ‘invisible masculinity’ is particularly apt as Thai society carefully curates social harmony in gender relations rather than showing any overt displays of disapproval.   9 Women in the gem and jewellery industry The Thai gem and jewellery industry employed over 1 million people in 2020 (Rittapirom, 2021 ), including many women in the formal sector and many more in the informal sector. This is in contrast with India and Sri Lanka, where the gem industry employs few women (Lawson, 2019 ). A small number of Thai women are influential in the industry and there are gender-friendly workplaces where women can play an important role. For example, Pranda provides childcare facilities and comfortable facilities for women to meet and eat together. The gem industry clusters in the capital (Scott, 1995) and the regional gemstone hubs, and both these locations welcome and enable the commercial activity of women. Women can learn the trade and participate in commerce and marketing , as well as in creative and skilled activities in, stone cutting and polishing and jewellery-making. Universities and government institutions are key enablers. However, the division of labour is gendered, and women earn less than men in some factories. Cultural norms can prevent women from achieving their full potential, while women are not excluded from any activity, they tend to be found doing lighter work and male workers are seen as more versatile and able to undertake heavier duties such as casting. Women’s more restricted work repertoire is less well paid. While it is acknowledged that Thai women are skilful gem cutters, in factories it was observed that women tend to undertake less intricate cuts which are less well renumerated. In terms of starting their own business, women with deep industry knowledge, reported they lacked confidence in their business acumen compared to their male colleagues and that juggling family responsibility also limited their opportunities to break into more lucrative commercial aspects of the trade. These challenges will now be discussed.  10 Gemstone cutters and goldsmiths Thailand has an established reputation as a global centre for the cutting and polishing of gemstones and its cutters are some of the best in the world. Their current craft was developed some 60 years ago and combines the best of Dutch diamond cutting and French innovation to permit fine precision cutting. Thai cutters follow the natural shape of the stone rather than set designs and are able to do this because they are carefully apprenticed over a 5-year period (Prim, 2021 ). What is less well known is that some of Thailand’s best cutters are women and that they are a significant part of Thai gemstone ecosystem. Working conditions for women in Thai gem and jewellery factories vary from comfortable and family-friendly in some of the large firms like Pranda (2018) where women do reach positions of leadership, and multinational Pandora (2019) , to the poorer conditions in factories and home-based work where women suffer gender inequities. Finding work in a factory does disrupt gender norms and gives many women workers, particularly in rural areas, greater economic independence. Yet gender discrimination is systemic (Mills, 2003 ) with women earning less than men and suffering sexual harassment. While there are some powerful women leaders in the industry, they are typically drawn from the highly educated and business elite. Gendered norms around the type of work women can and cannot do perpetuate inequality, (Lawson, 2019; Barrientos, 2019; Mills, 2003 ). Although there are examples of social upgrading for women in factory work (IFC, 2013), value chain participation can too often recreate gendered subordination in the commercial sphere (Dunaway, 2013; Kabeer, 2015 ). Factory work, often supplying multinational global value chains, has provided a vital source of income for many Thai women, particularly from the poorer rural areas of the northeast (Mills, 1999 ). The work they do is an example of the contradictory empowerment and disempowerment of the work offered globally to women in global value chains. Barrientos (2019)  has called this the ‘low road’ to development, with some income and economic freedom but no security and inferior wages to male colleagues. Two examples are illustrative of the contradictory empowerment and disempowerment offered to women in the Thai gemstone value chain. Thai female cutters are considered to be among the finest in the country and up and coming foreign firms, for example Greenland Rubies (Greenland Rubies, 2020 ) are happy to tout their all-women teams of sorters and cutters. Yet despite women’s skills, Lawson (2019)  found that pervasive norms around women’s role and gender inequality disadvantage women in some factory settings and there are persistent economic disincentives for female cutters linked to limitations placed upon women’s work. More sophisticated, better-paid cutting tasks are performed by men. For example in Chanthaburi and Bangkok workshops, the pre forming and grading of stones was done by women and was less well paid than male colleague’s work on more complex cuts further down the production line. A more insidious undermining of women’s equality is perpetuated by deep seated cultural norms around work, skin colour and beauty and what women are prepared to sacrifice to maintain such norms. In Thailand skin tone is a status marker of wealth, class and sexual attractiveness with those with pale skin treated better than women with darker skin. Skin colour is linked with class based labour distinctions, particularly the sun exposure associated with… manual labour ( Vorng, 2017 , p.123).  Cutting and polishing gemstones and jewellery making is manual work, fingers and hands can be roughened, and small nicks and scarring occurs. It is possible that norms around beauty and manual work place a subtle brake on women’s full participation in the value chain. This research suggests that some disempowerment results from the constraints and prejudices society and women place on themselves. Some women reported excluding themselves from skilled work in the gold smithing industry because of a subtler form of sexist and racist discrimination—the equation of pale skin with beauty and power (Vorng, 2017 ). Lawson (2019)  reported some highly skilled female goldsmiths, trained in the Royal Goldsmith College, discontinued their work for fear it would damage their appearance, darken their skin, and make them a less attractive romantic partner. 10.1 Home-based work An important challenge facing women in the Thai gem and jewellery industry is the work conditions experienced by the many thousands of women engaged at the lower end of the cutting and polishing sector, those working in unregulated factories and cottage industries close to the import hubs, These household industries are found across Thailand, in Bangkok, or clustered near the gemstone-producing centres of Chanthaburi and Tak near the Myanmar border, and in north eastern areas of Chiang Mai and Kanchanaburi (Cross et al., 2010 ) in regional areas as well as on the margins of Bangkok and Chanthaburi (Cross et al., 2010; HomeNet Thailand, 2012 ). The disadvantage is particularly acute for women in the informal sector working at home, even though these skilled craftswomen have provided a steady supply of finely cut and polished stones to the Thai industry. They receive very little remuneration, and they report bullying, intimidation, and occupational injuries, particularly to their eyes (Cross et al., 2010; HomeNet Thailand, 2012 ). Barrientos (2019)  argues that the growth of women’s home-based work, like that of these gemstone cutters, has been based on the commercialisation of many activities previously undertaken, unpaid, by women in the home. This has helped to draw women into fragmented paid work where there is a blurring of traditional gendered boundaries between paid work in commercial production and unpaid work within households (Barrientos, 2019 , p. 54). Feminist political economic thinking provides insights into the gender implications of blurring the boundaries between commercial production in factories and farms and social reproduction within households. Too often, “value creation, enhancement and capture are underpinned by the social undervaluation of work and skills traditionally undertaken by women, allowing goods to be produced cheaply and enhancing value capture by suppliers and lead firms” (Barrientos, 2019 , p. 80) at the expense of women’s empowerment. This seems to be the case for some Thai female cutters. The deep economic and social inequality which cuts across Thailand can be seen in the stark contrast between the majority of female cutters working in the informal sector particularly in regional and border areas and those with secure jobs working in the formal sector. Many homebased gem cutters are working for very small piece pay rates which are exploitative and only accepted because of poverty as one female cutter remarked “[W]e cannot stop cutting stones, it is the only skill we have” (Cross et al., 2010 ). Women working in the informal sector in Thailand such as these homeworkers have been particularly badly impacted by the Covid 19 pandemic, losing a large percentage their work (WEIGO, 2020). Such women are deeply disadvantaged in comparison to women working in the capital who have had opportunities through higher education to work in gem evaluation, formal gem businesses and to succeed in their own businesses.   11 Traders In the thriving Thai gem and jewellery ecosystem, while considerable value is captured through Thai skills in lapidary and jewellery-making, the greatest value addition is the result of trade networks and marketing within the Thai business node of the value chain in Bangkok and other gem regions. The dynamic character of the industry and its preeminent position in the value chain has been leveraged from its traditional position at the centre of the gem trade (Roy Chowdhury and Abid, 2018; Shor and Weldon, 2009 ) with the help of powerful institutional backers. The industry has been “extremely effective in securing forceful political expression of their needs and goals” (Scott, 1994 , p. 249). Within the upper reaches of the industry particularly in leading Sino Thai family business, women are empowered to take on highest roles of leadership and are proud of the empowering role that their business can have for women and girls. Pranda for example offers an annual scholarship to 150 rural women to come to Bangkok to learn and be integrated into the business (Pranda Vice President interview, 2018). The Danish multinational jewellery firm, Pandora, established its factory and crafting facilities in Thailand, it employs over 13 thousand workers, 56% are female. Yet only a small number of women (12%) are found in their executive leadership team (Pandora, 2020 ), suggesting ongoing gender bias. Research (Lawson, 2019 ) among female owned and led gem trading businesses in Bangkok’s gem trading hubs found further evidence of such gender bias and 'structures of constraint' (Folbre, 1994 ). The persistence of what Ahl (2006)  calls an ‘invisible masculinity’ in entrepreneurship can be seen in the accounts of women trying to set up their own business without strong family support. Female gemstone business owners reported encountering forms of sexism and bullying at work and when they were trying to purchase rough material in the field on the Myanmar border (Lawson, 2019 ). Interviews, with women working in offices in Bangkok, revealed that despite their deep levels of knowledge of gemmology, they lacked the confidence to become entrepreneurs and start their own business in the way that their male colleagues had done. Such a lack of confidence among female entrepreneurs is closely related to their entrepreneurial identity and self-efficacy (Greene & Brush, 2018). Another factor discouraging Thai women from becoming gemstone entrepreneurs is the disproportionate share of unpaid family duties they undertake (Kabeer, 2015 ). Gender norms dictate that this ‘reproductive tax’ (Palmer, 1992 ) is less likely to apply to men who are thus free to build business networks and accumulate capital.  12 University enabled knowledge and empowerment Research into the role of women in the Thai node of the global gem and jewellery value chain, found that the women interviewed demonstrated a sophisticated product knowledge particularly compared with actors closer to the source of the gemstones in source countries such as East Africa and Madagascar. This is in part due to the education opportunities they have received from a vibrant Thai gem and jewellery ecosystem, a multi-institutional framework, including universities, government (vital for the regulation of the sector), partnerships, and intermediaries, as well as sources of finance and markets that have enabled Thai women in the industry. Universities have provided skilled staff for the business of gem certification, for design, sophisticated cutting and polishing, and for business development. Women’s empowerment in this value chain is enabled by the low fees in Bangkok’s public universities. This provides many Thai women with the opportunity to study a wide range of subjects related to the science, art, and commerce of gemstones. In the capital there are a number of powerful women in academe, business, and the GIT who hold considerable convening power and influence and take an active role in mentoring young women entering the industry. A number of women working in Thai universities are global academic leaders in the science of gemstones and now teach and mentor the next generation of scientists (Phlayrahan et al., in press). Yet persistent inequality observed across Thailand is evident here as well. One undergraduate programme leader of a regional university programme in gemmology confided that all her graduates needed further training and work experience preferably in a foreign owned lab, in order to have any chance of a good job (Lawson, 2019 ). This is another example of a persistent structural inequality that cross cuts Thai society with those in the regions in public universities being empowered but not to the same level as those more privileged students in prestigious institutions in the capital. Women play a significant role in the Thai industry both as academic and business leaders and as some of Thailand’s finest cutters and jewellery makers and designers. This is in stark contrast to one of Thailand’s closest rivals in the gemstone industry, India, where women’s role has, until recently typically, been limited to home-based lapidary (Workplace Health Without Borders (WHWB., in press )). In gemstone producing nations, for example in East Africa and Madagascar, women are actively engaged in some parts of the mining process but their role in value addition, cutting polishing and jewellery making, is still at an early stage. Women in the Thai node of the global gem and jewellery value chain, demonstrate a sophisticated product knowledge particularly compared with actors closer to the source of the gemstones. The role of women in the Thai gem and jewellery industry is to be celebrated yet also critically considered in the light of persistent and growing inequality in Thai society as can be seen in  Fig. 3 . The industry has permitted some progress towards the attainment of SDGs 5, 8, and 10, but that progress has been imperfect, and it is characterised by the systemic inequality that cuts across gender relations and the urban–rural divide. Women in the industry, particularly those in the capital, have many opportunities for empowerment—both economic and personal (SDG 5). The Thai gem and jewellery ecosystem occupies a historically established position at the centre of the coloured gemstone industry in South-East Asia. Women benefit from this position, the government’s support to the industry, and opportunities for university study. Yet, cultural norms related to gender relations, and to the work women may acceptably perform, sabotage their opportunities for empowerment and result in their being relegated to less well-paid work (SDG 8). The ‘invisible masculinity’ of business relations (Ahl, 2006 ) can prevent women from attempting to establish their own gem-related business or succeeding at it. The benefits from participating in the gemstone value chain are not spread equitably across women in Thailand. Opportunities for empowerment are far greater for women living in the capital than they are for rural women working in the informal sector close to the borders. Women’s work in the gemstone industry does not always reduce inequality within the country (SDG 10), it reflects and, perhaps, even perpetuates the entrenched and growing patterns of inequality within the country. The gem and jewellery sector finds in women in the informal sector, particularly in home-based work, a source of skilled but cheap and docile labour to exploit and prosper off. These vulnerable workers suffer poor piece-rate pay and they labour in conditions that endanger their and their families’, health and safety.  13 Concluding thoughts COVID 19 has meant losses of up to three years of progress in SDG 5 with women carrying the brunt of unpaid care work, women are more likely to lose work and less likely to be rehired and the shadow pandemic of domestic violence (United Nations (UN), 2020 ). The Thai gem and jewellery industry used the downturn to build confidence in the quality of Thai products through certification and the promotion of a global gem festival in Chanthaburi (Sakuntanaga, in Yan, 2021 ). Strategic documents from the GIT and the Thai Board of Investment make no mention of gender, such a gender-neutral approach is unlikely to improve conditions for women in the sector. This disregard for women also misses an opportunity to showcase and capitalise on this unique aspect of the Thai gem and jewellery industry in advertising and product promotion. There is an opportunity to build these skilled workers’ capacity to create designs that are appealing to a new generation of jewellery buyers for example the growing influence of women customers (Roden, 2020 ). There is also a need to facilitate women’s capacity to face future trends such as the mechanisation of cutting: global trends suggest that mechanisation of processes can leave women behind. Bodies like the Responsible Jewellery Council suggest that a growing group of consumers are looking to better understand how their purchase can contribute to sustainable development. In Thailand, there is considerable potential to harness current interest in the work of women and improve the conditions of those in cottage industries. The Thai gem industry has been founded on public private partnerships; large companies like Pranda work could with women’s groups to assure that future industry recognises the role of women and improves the working conditions of poorer women in the informal sector. Across the globe there are international women in mining groups and there is a gap in this area in the Thai industry. Thai women leaders in business and academe need to work with grass roots organisations such as WIEGO to create an association which raises awareness of women’s rights and their needs and champions due diligence in this area. The situation of women cutters and polishers currently working in exploitative informal conditions could be improved by the regulation and formalisation of their work enabling them to obtain workplace benefits. The formalisation process must be inclusive and fair to these women (Buss et al., 2019 ). As Thailand seeks to consolidate its position as the global gem and jewellery industry leader, it can foster a new generation of gemstone entrepreneurs, especially its women and youth. It has the possibility to create an ecosystem that celebrates the role of women in this node of the value chain, the fine cutters, polishers, jewellers, business owners and leading women academics in gemmology that are a unique feature of the Thai gem and jewellery industry.
