                  A wide range of functional foods has been developed to meet health-conscious consumer's needs, which are now an important drive worldwide to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs) 2 and 3. The identification of a prebiotic that modifies the human gut flora and improves host health is crucial. In this regard, mushrooms have received an attention as one of the healthiest low-calorie food in promoting overall well-being.We reviewed the latest advancements and emerging trends of functional foods derived from wild edible mushrooms. Furthermore, we further reviewed the wild edible mushrooms as a significant source of prebiotics and identified their potential applications in the pharmaceutical sector as well as the food packaging industry. Polysaccharides found in mushrooms have been demonstrated to possess anti-diabetic characteristics, antibacterial activity, anti-cancer and antiviral effects, and the inclusion of these polysaccharides into diets is highly beneficial. Additionally, it is anticipated that the utilization of mushrooms in muscle foods would expand as a result of the growing demand from consumers for foods that are either more sustainable, healthier, or functional. Mushroom resources will play a vital part in the achievement of sustainable development goals because of the important potentials available in the food and pharmaceutical industries.

The identification of a prebiotic that modifies the human gut flora and improves host health is crucial. In this regard, mushrooms have received an attention as one of the healthiest low-calorie food in promoting overall well-being.We reviewed the latest advancements and emerging trends of functional foods derived from wild edible mushrooms. Furthermore, we further reviewed the wild edible mushrooms as a significant source of prebiotics and identified their potential applications in the pharmaceutical sector as well as the food packaging industry. Polysaccharides found in mushrooms have been demonstrated to possess anti-diabetic characteristics, antibacterial activity, anti-cancer and antiviral effects, and the inclusion of these polysaccharides into diets is highly beneficial. Additionally, it is anticipated that the utilization of mushrooms in muscle foods would expand as a result of the growing demand from consumers for foods that are either more sustainable, healthier, or functional. Mushroom resources will play a vital part in the achievement of sustainable development goals because of the important potentials available in the food and pharmaceutical industries.

As a result, satisfying the growing population's desire for high-quality food and ensuring everyone's nutritional needs is a pressing concern. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2 aims to achieve "zero hunger" and is dedicated to the noble pursuit of eradicating all manifestations of malnutrition and hunger by the year 2030. Its overarching mission is to foster a world where every individual, particularly our precious children, can revel in an abundance of nourishment that sustains them throughout the entirety of the year. A growing concern for food quality can be seen in the increased desire for functional foods that are chemical-free. The world's population is expected to reach 9 billion by 2050, which will place twice as much pressure on the planet's limited resources. People worldwide, have long considered mushrooms a healthy food. Due to their minerals, carbohydrates, vitamins, and proteins, mushrooms are used as dietary supplements. Our knowledge of mushrooms has expanded, making them a nutraceutical, functional food, and possible pharmaceutically potential candidate for antitumor, hepatoprotective, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, and wound healing etc. as well as the treatment for many other life style diseases (Sarkar et al., 2024 ; Zhang et al., 2024 ). Mushrooms are considered a delicacy in many cuisines and are even referred to as "vegetable meat" in some circles. Based on their intended use, mushrooms are typically classified as either edible (54%), medicinal (38%), or wild (8%). Only about 35 species of mushrooms are farmed for human consumption, whereas approximately 200 wild species are used for therapeutic purposes, including mushrooms like Agaricus bisporus, Lentinula edodes, Pleurotus  sp. and Flammulina velutipes  are cultivated (Arunachalam et al., 2022 ; Das et al., 2021 ). The moisture content of mushrooms is quite high, typically hovering around the 95 g/100 g mark. They contain a lot of protein (200–250 g/kg of dry matter) with the amino acids leucine, valine, glutamine, glutamic acid, and aspartic being particularly plentiful. Linoleic acid (C18:2), oleic acid (C18:1), and palmitic acid (C16:0) are the three primary fatty acids, making these foods low in calories. Mushrooms fit for human consumption have significant levels of ash, (between 80 and 120 g/kg of dry matter), and are a good source of minerals like potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, copper, iron, and zinc. Chitin, glycogen, trehalose, and mannitol are all found in them as carbohydrates, and they also have fibre, beta-glucans, hemicelluloses, and pectic compounds (Malinowski et al., 2021 ). In addition to their proven efficacy as a medication, medicinal mushrooms ar e also a novel class of items known as functional foods, nutraceuticals, and dietary supplements due to their positive impact on human health. Intake of mushrooms or mushroom products on a regular basis has been found to be helpful in the treatment and protection against a wide variety of diseases. Mushrooms are being included in the vegetarian diet because they contain all nine essential amino acids, which are mostly observed in muscle protein (Das et al., 2021 ). Lentinus and Auricularia are examples of mushrooms fit for human consumption that show promise as both therapeutic and practical food sources (Assemie & Abaya, 2022 ).Therefore, we reviewed thewild edible mushrooms as a source of prebiotics, nutritional characteristics, functional foods and their applications in the food industry along with pharmaceutical applications.  2 Prebiotics: mushrooms as a major source In the field of food science, prebiotic oligosaccharides have been getting more and more attention over the past few decades. The ability of prebiotics like oligosaccharides and inulin to improve host health by altering the makeup of colonic microbiota in the human gut through the suppression of exogenous pathogens has sparked a flurry of interest in these compounds as a functional food ingredient (Jayachandran et al., 2017 ). And as per authors point of view, a prebiotic is "a non-digestible food element that beneficially impacts the host by selectively encouraging the growth and/or activity of one or a restricted number of bacteria in the colon,". They coined that, with the exception of its selectiveness for particular species, the concept of prebiotics is largely synonymous with the definition of dietary fiber. In contrast, prebiotics were classified as short-chain carbohydrates (Cummings et al., 2001 ). This concept was modified by Gibson (2004)  as "selectively fermented substances that induce significant changes, both in the constitution and/or function of the gut microbiota, that impart benefits on the host's well-being and health". Carbohydrates in the diet, like fibers, were identified as potential prebiotics; however, oligosaccharides were found to be more effective (Gibson, 2004 ). Inulin and its derivatives, along with galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), are two examples of commercially available prebiotics that have found widespread application as a functional constituent in food due to their low production cost and beneficial effects on gut microbes (Davani-Davari et al., 2019a ). Ganoderma lucidum  fruiting bodies, spores, and mycelium contain several glycans (Liu et al., 2002 ). Polysaccharides have anti-genotoxic, anticancer, and immunomodulating properties (Krishnakumar et al., 2023 ). Mushroom polysaccharides (Pleurotus tuber-regium ) inhibit human liver cancer cells (Tao et al., 2006 ). Polysaccharides from Pleurotusostreatus  fruiting bodies inhibited HeLa carcinoma cell growth (Tong et al., 2009 ). Polysaccharides from higher basidiomycetes mushrooms, including Lentinus edodes, Schizophyllum commune,  andGrifolafrondosa,  have anticancer properties (Sivanesan et al., 2022 ). Pleurotus. ostreatus  and Flammulina velutipes  were observed with an antioxidant properties. F. velutipes  ergothioneine can prevent ground beef browning for 12 days and large-eye tuna meat (Thunnus obesus ) for 7 days (Chun et al., 2021 ). This shows that mushrooms may become a food supplement or medicine. Eating mushrooms improves health as well as their therapeutic properties. Protein, carbs, fiber, vitamins, and minerals are rich, while calories, salt, fat, and cholesterol are minimal. A healthy diet can include mushrooms, which are rich in numerous nutrients. Some important forms of prebiotics are listed in Table 1  . People used to think that eating prebiotics would boost the immune system, improve the health of the colon, lower the number and severity of bowel infections slow down allergic reactions, and make it easier to digest and pass food. But, these results weren't an indirect result of consuming prebiotics. The prebiotics effect arises via changes in the gastrointestinal microbiota (bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, and the histolyticum subgroup; bacteroides; and clostridia), indicating that the prebiotics impact is indirect (Ijabadeniyi, 2024 ). Prebiotics are most effectively directed toward the beneficial microorganisms bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. Prebiotics have a beneficial effect because they boost the population of beneficial bacteria like lactobacilli and bifidobacteria while suppressing the growth of pathogenic ones like the histolyticum subgroup (Yadav et al., 2022 ). Lactobacilli promote lactose digestion in lactose-intolerant patients, reduce constipation and infantile diarrhoea, help resist infections like salmonella, and help treat irritable bowel syndrome; bifidobacteria can activate the immune system, create vitamin B, limit pathogen growth, reduce blood ammonia and blood cholesterol levels, and help restore the natural flora (María Remes Troche et al., 2020 ). 2.1 Prebiotic role of mushrooms In light of recent findings, it has become increasingly crucial to explore alternative avenues for obtaining prebiotics. Mushrooms, being a rich source of various carbohydrates like chitin, hemicellulose, beta-glucans, mannans, xylans, and galactans, possess great potential as prebiotics. Table 2   showcases a selection of noteworthy mushrooms, highlighting their valuable sources of carbohydrates and constitutions.Within the realm of fungal polysaccharides that contribute to the skeletal structure, chitin, an N-containing carbohydrate, plays a pivotal role in imparting form and rigidity to the cellular wall. Collectively, these polysaccharides constitute approximately 80%–90% of the desiccated substance within the cellular walls of mushrooms. Zygomycetes, Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes , and Deuteromycetes  are distinguished among fungal orders due to the presence of chitin, a structural polysaccharide. Conversely, it is noteworthy that other fungal orders, including Oomycetes, lack this particular feature. The chitin concentration in a total of eight combination samples of Boletus  sp. was quantified, resulting in a range of 68–102 mg/g of dry mass. The chitin molecules function as a substrate for dietary fibre, yet they remain resistant to human enzymatic degradation (Rahman et al., 2023 ). Mushroom polysaccharides are predominantly glucans, either linear or branched, with a wide range of glycosidic linkages, such as (1–3), (1–6), and (1–3)-α-glucans. True heteroglycans include sugars such arabinose, mannose, fucose, galactose, xylose, glucose, and glucuronic acid in their side chains. Polysaccharides in mushrooms are found in a wide variety of chemical structures, although the vast majority are β-glucans (Łysakowska et al., 2023 ). A range of 2.2–5.3 mg/g dry matter has been seen in Pleurotus  spp., and a value of 2 mg/g dry matter has been reported for Lentinula edodes . The β-glucan content of raw A. bisporus  varied between 1.2 and 1.7 mg/g, while that of cooked samples was between 0.8 and 4.2 mg/g. Although the beta glucan concentrations in raw P. ostreatus  and dried Boletus are 139.2 mg/g and 548.8 mg/g, respectively, the concentration in cooked mushrooms is slightly greater. Hydrolysis of β-glucosidic linkages is not possible with pancreatic or brush border-secreted digestive enzymes seen in mammals and other animals. Due to this, they are unaffected by stomach acid hydrolysis and cannot be broken down by human gastrointestinal enzymes (Teferra, 2021 ). Mushroom carbohydrate, which is not digested, can be a source of prebiotics because it fits a criterion for this category. However, not all carbohydrates included in food serve as prebiotics, much research is necessary before making such a claim. Extracts of the Pleurotus ostreatus  and P. eryngii  mushrooms were found to boost the growth of the probiotic strain Lactobacillus  sp. (4 strains: Lac A-D), Bifidobacterium  sp. (3 strains: Bifi A-C), and Enterococcus faecium  (2 strains: Ent A and B) (Synytsya et al., 2009 ). The study found that maxima were reached in terms of both growth rate and biomass density, with acid synthesis also reaching its final, maximum state. The growth of Lactobacillus  strains was observed to be encouraged more by P. eryngii  extract than by P. ostreatus extract. When given both extracts, Lactobacillus  B and C produced the shortest chain fatty acids (SCFA), while Bifidobacteria  A produced the least. All of the crucial characteristics of prebiotics have been outlined in Fig. 1  A. Non-digestibility or resistance in the upper gastrointestinal tract is the primary criterion for prebiotics because it ensures that the prebiotics will survive digestion and make it to the colon, where they can then efficiently activate the beneficial bacteria, bifidobacteria and lactobacilli (Davani-Davari et al., 2019b ). Defeating the digestive system means being resistant to digestion's three main phases: stomach acidity, mammalian enzyme breakdown, and intestinal uptake (Megur et al., 2022 ). Carbohydrates with fructose, galactose, glucose, or xylose as the monosaccharide unit are examples of non-digestible oligosaccharides that are commercially available or in developing as food products. There is no nutritional value in the indigestible oligosaccharides that are composed of one, two, or even three monosaccharides. It dissolves in water and has a mild sugary taste. The sweetness, however, varies with chain length. Reports claim that inulin with a polymer degree above 10 loses its sweetness (Mahalak et al., 2023 ). The ability for an item to be fermented selectively by good bacteria in the colon is another criterion for labelling it as a prebiotic. This fermentation has the potential to improve the host's health by increasing the expression or changing the composition of short-chain fatty acids, increasing faecal weight, slightly decreasing luminal colon pH, reducing nitrogenous end products and reductive enzymes, and increasing the expression of associated proteins or active carriers involved in mineral absorption and immune modulation (Ballini et al., 2023 ). Prebiotics are foods or supplements that, among other things, promote the development and/or activity of bacteria in the digestive tract that may be advantageous to human health. To be useful for the metabolism of gut bacteria, a prebiotic must be stable enough to resist the harsh conditions of food processing without being destroyed or chemically changed. In turn, this benefits human digestive health. A few commercial prebiotics were subjected to extensive testing over a range of processing settings. Inulin's prebiotic action was demonstrated to be significantly reduced only upon heating at low pH, and the product containing FOS was found to be the most unstable. There were hardly any noticeable shifts in prebiotic activity across any of the other processing conditions evaluated, including low pH processing and Maillard reaction conditions (Rai et al., 2021 ). More and more research suggests that humans benefit from a diet rich in fermentable foods, which fosters a microbiome rich in diversity in the colon. Specifically, diets that stimulate the growth of Lactobacillus  and Bifidobacterium  while inhibiting the growth of Clostridia  and Bacteroides  may be advantageous to health (Jayachandran et al., 2017 ). Beneficial intestinal flora can be selectively altered by consuming prebiotics like oligosaccharides, dietary fibers, and non-digestible carbohydrates. Several components of mushrooms, including chitin, hemicellulose, α-glucan, β-glucan, mannans, xylans, and galactans, have been found to have prebiotic characteristics (Yin et al., 2020 ). L. edodes  (Shiitake), Trametes versicolor  (Yunzhi), and Ganoderma lucidum  (Reishi) are three of the most well-known mushroom species, all of which have been found to exhibit potent prebiotic action. Mushroom prebiotics (polysaccharides and protein-polysaccharide complexes) were shown to survive the human digestive tract intact from the stomach through the small intestine and into the colon, where they promoted the growth of beneficial bacteria (Lactobaccilus acidophilus  and Bifidobacterium longum  subsp.). Growth of Bifidobacterium  sp. and Lactobacillus  sp. has also been demonstrated to be stimulated by glucans from Pleurotus ostreatus  and Pleurotus eryngii  (Yin et al., 2020 ) and Ganoderma lucidum  (Khan et al., 2018 ). Through influencing the host's energy homeostasis and plasma glucose levels, prebiotic mushroom polysaccharides have been linked to antiobesity and antidiabetic benefits (Martinez-Medina et al., 2021 ). Colonic fermentation produces short-chain fatty acids from non-digestible polysaccharides are thought to be responsible for restoring energy balance. Extracts of G. lucidum  have been shown in in vitro  studies to have anti-obesity effects by altering the composition of gut microbiota (Qin et al., 2024 ). Agrocybe chaxingu, Agaricus brasiliensis, Catathelasma ventricosum, Pleurotus abalonus, Ganoderma lucidum , G. frondosa and Tremella fuciformis  have all been linked to polysaccharides that may help treat metabolic disorders (Das et al., 2021 ). Fig. 1 B summarizes the possible health-promoting bioactive compounds present in mushrooms.   3 Functional foods To eliminate nutritional deprivation and to establish the true platform of zero hunger as per SDG-2 goal, the role in developing functional foods has a major impact. There has been a shift in focus in recent years towards the physiological roles that different diets play in response to rising health concerns. Rather than relying on synthetic chemicals, many people are now getting these boosters from plants and herbs. As more and more people want products that are good for their health, new and different products have entered the market. Functional foods and dietary supplements go by a variety of names. In reality, these words describe meals that have unique health benefits for humans. Functional foods are described in hundreds of different ways. Because of the large variety of definitions, it is challenging to offer trustworthy data on market trends and potential to business partners or to appropriately safeguard consumers through legislation. As a result, gathered a panel of experts from the Americas, Europe, and Canada to rethink the original meaning of functional foods using the Delphi method. These days, we consider to be "functional foods" anything that resembles, or is marketed as, a more traditional type of cuisine (Damián et al., 2022 ). It needs to be consumed regularly and in reasonable amounts to qualify as part of a typical diet. In addition to serving as a source of nutrition, it should have shown promise in lowering the possibilities of certain persistent illnesses or positively impacting particular target functions. Products like newborn milk formula, baked goods; chocolate, dairy, and healthy beveragesare abundant on the market and often include functional additives. Recent years have seen a surge in interest in functional food components like prebiotics (Bakshi et al., 2023 ). 3.1 Role of mushrooms as a functional food Food processing uses a lot of different ingredients, but those with nutritional or functional properties that affect the quality of the end product deserve special attention for the important roles they play. As a result, the incorporation of ingredients has become standard practice in the creation of new culinary products. The safety and health benefits of substances or compounds derived from natural sources are, nevertheless, of great interest (Samtiya et al., 2021 ). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines them as the components that have an indirect or direct impact on the characteristics of the food you eat. They are incorporated at every subsequent step in the food's journey from the point of production to the point of sale, including packing, storage, and distribution. The goal is to enhance the food items' freshness, appearance, and overall acceptability by changing their flavour and texture, in addition to their nutritional quality and safety. If these substances, or some of their constituents, have a favourable effect on health and can be used to treat or prevent disease, they are called nutraceuticals. Nutraceuticals can be whole foods, parts of foods, or even just one component or extract from foods that are used as a dietary supplements. Only when these nutraceuticals are included in the meal or its formulation to accomplish a particular intended function, such as enhancing human health and longevity or lowering the likelihood of contracting a disease, is the food considered functional (AlAli et al., 2021 ). Mushrooms are delicious, nutritious, and are used as a dietary supplement and as a possible replacement for meat, fish, vegetables, fruits, etc. due to their distinctive nutritional and textural features. Mushrooms can be grown in large quantities from the recycling of low-value agricultural waste, such as agro-industrial waste, with minimal investment in land and labour (Colunga et al., 2020 ; Pérez-Chávez et al., 2019 ). Consequently, it may be possible to lessen the prevalence of protein energy deficiency in people by providing enriched or fortified diets with an excellent supply of protein containing all the required amino acids. In addition, mushrooms can be employed as bio-therapeutic agents, since they contain several secondary metabolites, nutraceuticals, or biologically active substances with medicinal significance (Das et al., 2021 ). Mushrooms are a complete food since they provide nourishment, satisfy the palate, and support the body's physiological needs. Mushrooms get their distinctive umami flavour from the sodium salts of free amino acids and 5′ nucleotides. Umami, commonly known as the savoury taste, is simply the overall flavour of food that is improved by monosodium glutamate (Zhao et al., 2023 ). As a result of their distinctive taste, mushrooms are widely favoured and used in a wide variety of culinary formulations. Umami flavour peptides and umami-enhancing peptides have been cited as additional factors that contribute to the mushroom's overall sensory appeal. Sweet, bitter, umami, sour, and salty are all flavours that can be produced by peptides, each of which has a distinct structure and length that contributes to their production. They have no flavour by themselves in water, but when combined with the appropriate tastes, they amplify the sensation of saltiness, sweetness, sourness, bitterness, or umami (Valerón et al., 2023 ). Glu-Glu, Glu-Asp, Glu-Asp-Glu, and Glu-Gly-Ser are only some examples of glu-containing di- and tripeptides that have been shown to improve umami flavour by a number of researchers (Kong et al., 2017 ). In recent years, umami peptides (composed of two tripeptides and three dipeptides) have been isolated from shiitake mushroom hydrolysates; these peptides are thought to be responsible for the mushroom's distinctive flavour. They're responsible for the mushroom's distinct flavour and can even alter the overall flavour of foods through interactions with other volatile compounds (Kong et al., 2019 ). A further study found that peptides with the umami taste, such as Gly-Leu-Pro-Asp and Gly-His-Gly-Asp, extracted from the mushroom Agaricus bisporus , functioned as crucial molecules for kokumi taste. Kokumi flavour is most easily described by qualities like mouthful, intricacy, and continuity. Kokumi taste compounds have a subtle flavour or no flavour at all on their own, but they can intensify the flavour of sweet, salty, sour, and umami foods. These peptides from Agaricus bisporus , when added to a plain chicken broth, produce novel flavour sensations, including mouth-fullness and complexity (Feng et al., 2019 ).  3.2 Nutritional value In addition to being low in fat and calories while being high in fiber, mushrooms also contain all nine essential amino acids. The dry matter, protein, and fat composition of mushroom fruit bodies range from 5% to 15%, 19%–35%, and 0%–5%, respectively (Table 3  ). Compared to tomatoes and carrots, mushrooms pack four times as much protein, while oranges and apples offer six and twelve times, respectively (Kour et al., 2022 ). The non-starch polysaccharides found in mushrooms make them a great option for anyone looking to increase their intake of dietary fiber. Insoluble dietary fibre (IDF) and glucans make up the bulk of mushroom stems. Hence, polysaccharide complexes with biological activity could be prepared from mushroom stems and used as a dietary supplement. The stem of Flammulina velutipes  was found to contain 32% dietary fibre (Banerjee et al., 2020 ). Mushrooms may aid in weight loss and the prevention of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia because they are low in fat and high in fibre. Moreover, mushrooms are good for you because they contain necessary fatty acids (52–87% unsaturated fatty acids), primarily in the form of linoleic acid (Venturella et al., 2021 ). Linoleic acid is a type of unsaturated fatty acid that the human body needs but cannot produce on its own. Mushrooms have a lot of potential as sources of new prebiotic components due to their high concentration of undigested polysaccharides (Sawangwan et al., 2018 ). Mushrooms may help diabetics since they have a low glycemic index and a high mannitol content (Mwangi et al., 2022 ). Mushrooms are rich in micronutrients, including vitamins B1 , B2 , B12 , C, D, E, niacin, and folate, and they are also a good source of dietary fiber and proteins. Vitamin D, also known as "the sunshine vitamin," can be found in mushrooms despite the fact that they are grown in the dark and are not derived from any kind of animal. Sunlight and UV-B light exposure significantly boost the vitamin D (especially vitamin D2 ) content of mushrooms (Elkhateeb & Daba, 2023 ). This has important implications for the cartilage and bone health of vegans and vegetarians.Mushrooms are also an excellent way to get the minerals iron, copper, manganese, and zinc, all of which are crucial to the health of your body and the smooth operation of your metabolic pathways. Mushrooms typically have far higher concentrations of several essential trace elements than vegetables do, including potassium and phosphorus (Genccelep, 2012 ). A variety of flavonoids, which may have beneficial health effects, can be produced by edible mushrooms.  3.3 Nutraceutical supplements Mushrooms contain natural substances called nutraceuticals, which have been shown to improve human performance and reduce the chance of developing certain diseases. Several biological activities are mentioned here that have been linked to mushroom nutraceuticals and their possible advantages in improving health and warding off disease. Lectins, triterpenoids, hispolon, calcaelin, proteoglycan, lentinan, ganoderic acid, β-glucan, phenolics, flavonoids, laccase, nucleosides, nucleotides, and ergosterol are only some of the nutraceuticals that have been found in mushrooms (Venturella et al., 2021 ). Mushroom extracts and fruiting parts contain high polyphenolic compounds, especially phenolic acids, such as benzoic acid and cinnamic acid derivatives. Acids such as salicylic, protocatechuic, p -hydroxybenzoic, p -coumaric, gallic, gentisic, vanillic, cinnamic, caffeic, syringic, veratric, and ferulic have been identified in a variety of mushroom species (Nowacka-Jechalke et al., 2018 ). There has been a lot of research into the biological effects and possible health advantages of some of these nutraceuticals. Chitin, beta-glucan, beta-glucan, mannans, xylans, and galactans are only some of the polysaccharides present in mushrooms that have been linked to possible health advantages (Anusiya et al., 2021 ). Mushroom nutraceuticals have been shown to have a variety of health benefits, including antitumor, antimutagenic, anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, antidiabetic, antiviral, antibacterial, anti-obesity, and anti-hypercholesterolemic effects, among others (Marçal et al., 2021 ).   4 Mushrooms: Food industry applications Mushrooms that can be eaten can be used directly as ingredients or indirectly as a source of fermentation in processed foods. In the past, people ate mushrooms directly to get their nutrients. Numerous tasty dishes benefit from the addition of mushrooms. Researchers have tried to produce nutrient-dense bread using mushrooms, but this approach wastes vital fitness assets (Lu, Brennan, et al., 2021 ). The dough volume, or the size of the bread's loaf, was lowered by adding 10%–12% Grifola frondosa  mushroom. G. frondosa , on the other hand, aided alcoholic fermentation by feeding bakery yeast sugar (Naeem et al., 2020 ). Mushrooms can also be used in a secondary process that produces fresh meals. i.e., the stem of the shiitake mushroom, a type of fungus that is mostly grown in Taiwan but is traditionally disregarded because of its coarse texture (El-Ramady et al., 2022 ). Yet, due to their high protein content, shiitake stipes can be utilized as a nitrogen source in the production of alcoholic beverages. The use of the Ganoderma lucidum  basidiomycete (therapeutic fungi) in the fermentation of soy milk resulted in increased health and fitness benefits. On rare occasions, the mushroom was used in place of Saccharomyces cerevisiae  during the wine and beer making processes. In place of S. cerevisiae  or Tricholoma. matsutake , other yeasts such as Agaricus blazei, Flammulina velutipes , and Pleurotus ostreatus  could be used during wine fermentation. Its ethanol-producing potential in beer fermentation has been confirmed for A. blazei, F. velutipes , and P. ostreatus  (Okamura-Matsui et al., 2003 ). Due to their high nutrient density and abundance of useful food components, edible mushrooms are widely recognized as exceptional nutritional supplements. Mushrooms are used as ingredients in the creation of unique functional foods aimed at health-conscious consumers, all in an effort to reap the benefits of their nutritional, nutraceutical, and other therapeutic aspects (Hamza et al., 2023 ). In addition to these benefits, food processors favour mushrooms as additives because of their pleasant aroma, flavour, and intrinsic functional qualities that alter texture, which are said to have a positive impact on the processed food's appearance, flavour, overall acceptance, and shelf-life (Banerjee et al., 2020 ). Breads, cookies, fish and meat products, and other preparations like instant soups, pasta, snack seasonings, casseroles, and rice dishes, are products that claim to increase nutritional profile and health benefits by using mushrooms as functional bioactive components. The utilization of a restricted assortment of mushroom varieties has been harnessed in the development of value-enhanced gastronomic products. The aforementioned items encompass pickled vegetables, dehydrated soup mix, and savory condiments, along with their integration into various baked goods like loaves of bread and biscuits. Moreover, the synergistic amalgamation of mushrooms and tomato pulp has been meticulously investigated in the realm of culinary science, with the aim of formulating delectable tomato-mushroom-infused ketchup and tomato-mushroom-infused soup (Biao et al., 2020 ). Mushrooms have significant promise in the area of protein-rich foods (meat, fish, etc.), but there are many other research articles available that accentuate mushrooms' potential as useful components in meals in a variety of contexts. Mushroom and its components added to food items not only improve their nutritional and functional health values (Biao et al., 2020 ), but also significantly affect their pleasant texture, taste, flavour, and stability (Fig. 2  A). The low salt content of mushrooms has helped spread their popularity. For instance, compared to other vegetables, Agaricus  sp. fruiting bodies have a relatively low salt content (396 mg/kg) (Das et al., 2021 ). Nevertheless, processed meats range in sodium content from 7 to 39 g of chloride per kilogram. Consuming an excessive amount of sodium through food raises the risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Because of this, adding mushrooms to processed meats before they reach the consumer may help lower their salt content, providing added health advantages. Mushrooms and their by-products (stipes and stem wastes) have been successfully used in the formulation of a wide range of muscle food products over the years, including chicken sausages, salted cooked beef, tuna meat, kuruma shrimp, emulsion-type pork sausages, traditional Turkish meatballs, fermented pork sausages, sutchi catfish patties, etc . (Das et al., 2021 ). 4.1 Role of mushrooms in muscle foods Mushrooms affect food quality through physiological qualities, lipid oxidation, texture and appearance, microbiological quality, and sensory features. Chemical composition, water-holding capacity (WHC), pH, emulsion stability, and cooking yield affect muscle meal quality and acceptability (Das et al., 2020 ). Muscle food pH regulates microbial development, which affects WHC, juiciness, cooking yield, texture, and shelf life. Winter mushroom (Flammulina velutipes ) powder enhanced the pH, WHC, and cooking yield of emulsion-type pork sausages by lowering fat and water exudation. Muscle foods lipids and proteins oxidize, causing rancid smells, off-flavors, and discoloration (Das et al., 2021 ). Free radicals like alkyl, alcoxyl, and peroxyl are generated when lipids are oxidized; these are responsible for protein oxidation. When meat is cooked at temperatures above 60 °C, the porphyrin ring is broken, releasing heme iron and accelerating the oxidation of lipids and proteins. These complex oxidative reactions produce several reaction products and waste vital nutrients (Domínguez et al., 2019 ). Essential amino acids and fatty acids may be denatured, and the formation of volatile off-flavours is a distinct possibility. Oxygen, light, temperature, and transition metal ions affect proteins and lipids oxidizing. Texture substantially influences the value and reliability of muscular foods. Muscle foods are soft, semi-solid materials with complicated compositions and structures that make them difficult to prepare, masticate, and digest. Lipids and minerals, as well as proteins' gel-forming and emulsification characteristics, affect the texture of muscle meals. Mushrooms affect muscle foods rheology; hence, mushroom-enriched products must be designed accordingly. Mushrooms have a particularly hard feel, and when processed with muscle foods, their nutritional fiber components provide a thick, meaty texture. Hence, they can be added to muscle meals up to a certain percentage without significantly altering their texture. Muscle foods opacity, colour, and surface shine indicate their quality and freshness, which influences consumer purchasing decisions. Mushrooms in muscle foods may change their look. Blends seem different since mushrooms are naturally darker than meat or fish. Different sized and shaped particles could be present in mushroom extracts compared to muscle meals, which can change their appearance (Das et al., 2021 ). Muscle foods have a lot of macronutrients and micronutrients that bacteria that cause food to go bad or make people sick can use to grow. Hence, effective methods to increase shelf-life and assure food safety are essential (Das et al., 2019 ). Mushrooms and their contents are antibacterial and antifungal. So, adding them to muscle meal may boost its safety and shelf-life. The mushroom fruiting body secretes peptides, proteins, steroids, terpenes, anthraquinones, benzoic acid derivatives, and quinolones for survival, which have antibacterial characteristics. Due to the immunomodulatory and antibacterial properties of β-glucans and secondary metabolites, medicinal mushrooms such as Aleurodiscus, Coprinus, Clitocybe, Daedalea, Marasmius, Merulius, Pleurotus, Polyporus, Poria, Psathyrella , and Tricholoma  spp. have been used as natural antibiotics to treat various diseases (Bhambri et al. 2022). Sensory qualities determine food quality and appeal. Muscle meals' look, flavour, texture, and oral processing affect their sensory impression. The type and number of edible mushrooms used in meat and fish products alters their physico-chemical properties and sensory qualities (Das et al., 2020 ).  4.2 Role of mushrooms in food packaging The constituents of mushroom polysaccharides, specifically chitin and its derivatives, have been explored for potential applications in the food industry. One approach involves the production of chitin nanocrystals, also known as whiskers, and chitin nanofibers (Serventi et al., 2021 ). Chitin nanoparticles have been characterized as very promising materials that possess the ability to enhance structural integrity and mechanical qualities in various food systems, including applications in food packaging. There is a growing focus on mushroom polysaccharide/chitin as a prospective material for food packaging, owing to its exceptional functional and biological attributes (Oladzadabbasabadi et al., 2022 ). The potential of chitosan derived from mushrooms is noteworthy due to its reportedly potent antioxidant and antibacterial properties. Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of scholarly investigations pertaining to the utilization of chitosan derived from mushrooms for the development of food packaging materials. Nevertheless, the current ones exhibit considerable promise. The physical characteristics of biofilms produced from chitosan obtained from A. bisporus  stalks are comparable to those formed from commercially available chitosan of both high and low molecular weights, which are derived from shrimp. These features include density, porosity, and water vapor properties. The films derived from Agaricus chitosan exhibited reduced flexibility, as indicated by an elongation at break measurement of 30.2%. Additionally, these films demonstrated a higher degree of hydrophobicity, as evidenced by a water vapor permeability value of 0.71, in comparison to films produced using commercially available shrimp chitosan. The water vapor permeability (WVP) value is measured at 0.74 g mm/kPa.h.m2 , while the elongation at break is recorded at 65.7%. The user has provided a numerical reference. The tensile strength of Agaricus chitosan film was found to be 4.31 MPa, which was observed to be lower than that of the high-molecular-weight commercial chitosan film (5.71 MPa) extracted from shrimp. However, it was observed to be greater than the tensile strength of the low-molecular-weight chitosan film, which measured 2.12 MPa (Bilbao-Sainz et al., 2017 ). Incorporating curcumin into the A. bisporus -extracted chitin nanoparticles resulted in a significant enhancement of the film's surface shape and light transmission. It has been hypothesized that curcumin's ability to bind to chitin and form complexes is responsible for the smoothing effect of increasing curcumin concentration on composite film. The higher mechanical capabilities of the chitin nanocomposite films were attributed to the redesigned structure. All the produced films showed excellent biodegradability; after 14 days in the soil, they had entirely broken down. Chicken breasts stored in the developed film had a 40% longer shelf life than those stored in cling film. This research demonstrated the utility of mushroom chitin nanoparticles in functional food packaging (Zheng et al., 2023 ). A link between the molecular weight (MW) and the quantity of hydrogen bonds formed between hydroxyl and amino groups during the process of film production. Therefore, it is plausible that the augmentation of the MW of A. bisporus  chitosan could potentially improve the mechanical properties of films derived from it. In terms of morphology, melon seeds that were treated with chitosan extracted from A. bisporus  stipes were comparable to seeds covered with commercially available chitosan-based coatings (Shahadha et al., 2023 ). The Agaricus chitosan coatings on the melon seeds were more constant and homogenous than the coatings made from shrimp chitosan. It was also demonstrated that using fungal chitosan-based edible coatings increased fruit firmness, improved fruit flavor by increasing the concentration of esters, stifled the development of undesirable flavors, and reduced the number of microorganisms. In addition to this, there are some mushroom species are well known for their chitin production including Agaricus volvaceus, A. acris, A. cantarellus, A. piperatus, Hydnum repandum, H. hybridum, Boletus viscidus, Pleurotuseryngii, P. ostreatus, P. pulmonarius, Lentinula edodes, Grifola frondosa, Hypsizygus marmoreus, H. tessulatus, Ganoderma tsugae, G. lucidum, Termitomyces titanicus, Flammulina velutipes, Trametes versicolor  and Morchella esculenta  (John Kasongo et al., 2020 ; Kumar et al., 2021 ). Overall, with the current state of knowledge, it is obvious to assume that mushrooms will become a significant source of chitin and chitosan in the near future. Mushroom chitin and chitosan are well recognized for physicochemical, functional, and biological properties, revealing the potential for industrial usage in the food and pharmaceutical industries.   5 Mushrooms: applications in pharmaceutical industry Mushrooms have gained recognition for their notable role as substantial natural reservoirs of immunotherapeutic constituents. These substances have the potential to serve as immune system modulators and boosters for the treatment of specific immunodeficiency disorders, including cancer, diabetic, and cardiovascular diseases. An overview of pharmaceutical activity has been presented in Fig. 2 B. The bioactive constituents derived from Pleurotus  mushroom, such as polysaccharopeptides, functional proteins (including ubiquitin-like peptides, ubiquinone-9, glycoproteins, and nebrodeolysin), proteoglycans, and glucans, exhibit the ability to modulate and regulate the immune response within the human body (Kumar et al., 2021 ). Proteins derived from Ganoderma lucidum , a species of fungus, and lectins, which are proteins that bind to sugars found in edible mushrooms, possess the remarkable ability to affect human immunological function. Through in vitro  experiments, immune cell development in humans has been shown to be aided by these proteins. The reported findings indicate that mushrooms possess an immunomodulatory effect, which has been observed to lead to the destruction of tumors (Zhao et al., 2020 ). The consumption of white button mushrooms in the diet has been observed to enhance the locomotion of NK (natural killer) cells in mice. NK cells, also known as natural killer cells, play a crucial role in the immune system by exerting their anti-tumour and anti-viral defense mechanisms. The augmented natural killer (NK) cell activity can be modulated through enhanced production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). The consumption of Agaricusbisporus  led to a directional change towards the T-helper 1 response, with a propensity for increased interleukin-2 and lymphocyte production [85]. Ophiocordyceps sinensis  protein (OSP), Cordyceps militaris protein (CMP), Caribena versicolor  protein (CVP), Morchella esculenta  protein (MEP), Inonotus obliquus  protein (IOP), Termitomyces albuminosus  protein (TAP), Agaricus bisporus  protein (ABP), Pleurotus eryngii  protein (PEP), Flammulina velutipes  protein (FVP), Volvariella volvacea  protein (VVP), Hericium erinaceus  protein (HEP) and Pleurotus ostreatus  protein (POP) etc., are some mushroom-based proteins are known to have the ability to produce tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon beta in RAW 264.7 macrophages, which are a type of cell line generated from BALB/c mice that undergoes Abelson leukemia  virus. Through its antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory activities, gamma interferon is an essential component of the host defense against diseases like atherosclerosis and autoimmune diseases. The production of IFN-γ by macrophages is greatly enhanced by OSP, CMP, CVP, MEP, IOP, TAP, FVP, POP, VVP, ABP, HEP, and PEP, and this enhancement is dosage-dependent. The percentage of stimulation reaches between 25.48 and 106.06% of the positive control, lipopolysaccharide. At a concentration of 200 mg/mL, the effects of TAP, IOP, CVP, MEP, FVP, PEP, POP, and ABP were the most pronounced, with IFN-γ production equal to 92.12, 83.03, 106.06, 80.00, 57.96, 35.67, 26.75, and 25.48% of the positive control group, respectively. On the other hand, CMP, VVP, and HEP exhibited a notable bellwether-type dose-dependent effect; at a concentration of 100 mg/mL, the strongest effect was observed, with IFN-γ production equal to 89.09, 66.90, and 28.66% of the positive control group, respectively. The following compounds enhanced macrophage IFN-γ production: TAP, IOP, CVP, MEP, OSP, and CMPall with effects exceeding 70% and POP, ABP, and HEP effects below 30%, respectively (Fig. 3   AandB) (Xu et al., 2022 ). In healthy immunological and inflammatory responses, macrophages and monocytes release the pro-inflammatory cytokine alpha-tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α). Numerous human disorders are believed to be linked to abnormalities in tumor necrosis factor-a production. These include enterocolitis, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, major depressive disorder, and many more.Xu et al. (2022)  observed TNF-α production at 48.59, 50.10, 60.58, 55.03, 31.05, 29.52, 29.86, 32.65, and 27.85% of the positive control group, respectively, at a concentration of 200 mg/mL, CMP, TAP, CVP, MEP, FVP, POP, VVP, ABP, and HEP had the most pronounced effects (Xu et al., 2022 ). At 100 mg/mL, the effect of IOP was the strongest, and 47.26% of the positive control group produced TNF-α. At 50 mg/mL, the effects of OSP and PEP were the strongest, and 26.41 and 48.29% of the positive control group produced TNF- α, respectively (Fig. 3  C and D). Among these, CVP led to the greatest increase in TNF-α production by macrophages, with an effect of 60%, while POP, VVP, PEP, and HEP promoted IFN-γ production by macrophages, but with poorer effects below 30%. They all reached levels that were quite significant (p < 0.01). Hence, this study demonstrated that the various crude proteins found in edible mushrooms enhanced the phagocytosis and multiplication of macrophages in mice. 5.1 Anticancer effects Medicinal mushrooms harbour a plethora of bioactive compounds that exhibit promising potential in the realm of anticancer properties. The aforementioned compounds encompass dietary fibre, polysaccharides, intricate combinations of polysaccharides and proteins, steroids, terpenoids, phenolics, and specific categories of proteins. The polysaccharides derived from mushrooms exhibited promising anti-tumorigenic effects against mammary adenocarcinoma 755, sarcoma 180, and leukemia L-1210. It has been reported that certain mushrooms belonging to the genera Agaricus, Antrodia, Pleurotus, Phellinus, Clitocybe, Cordyceps, Ganoderma, Trametes, Flammulina, Schizophyllum, Calvatia, Inonotus, Suillus, Albatrellus, Inocybe, Funlia, Russula, Lactarius , Xerocomus  and Fomes  exhibit notable anti-carcinogenic properties (Patel & Goyal, 2012 ). Mushrooms contain compounds that exhibit anti-cancer properties by acting as inducers of reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibitors of mitosis and mitotic kinases, as well as topoisomerases. Additionally, these compounds inhibit angiogenesis, leading to the apoptosis of cancer cells and ultimately impeding their proliferation. Additionally, the extraction of a polysaccharide from Agaricus blazei  has been observed to inhibit angiogenesis in vivo , thus demonstrating the potential of polysaccharides derived from edible mushrooms to possess anti-carcinogenic properties. Mushrooms indigenous to the southern region of India, namely Pleurotus florida, P. pulmonaris, Phellinus rimosus,  and G. lucidum , have been observed to possess notable antioxidant and anti-tumor properties. These sources have been reported to contain valuable components with antitumor and antioxidant properties and exhibit potential activities in preventing the formation of cancerous cells and reducing the occurrence of genetic mutations (Sivanesan et al., 2022 ). The potential of A. bisporus , commonly known as button mushrooms, to reduce breast cancer has been observed. This is attributed to their ability to decrease expression of aromatase and the biosynthesis of estrogen, as indicated by both in vivo  and in vitro  studies (Gariboldi et al., 2023 ).  5.2 Anti-diabetic effects Mushrooms may regulate diabetes. These sources are bioactive and include diabetes-fighting components. Many fungal species regulate blood glucose and prevent diabetes consequences. Several studies have shown that Agaricus subrufescens, A. bisporus, Coprinus comatus, Cordyceps sinensis, Inonotus obliquus, G. lucidum, Pleurotus  sp., Phellinus linteus, Sparassis crispa,  and Poriacocos  can lower blood sugar. Mushrooms are high in protein, vitamins, and minerals and low in lipids, cholesterol, and carbs. Thus, diabetics can eat these fungi for low-calorie nutrition (Chowdhury & Paul, 2020 ). It has been shown that mushrooms can store natural chemicals with anti-diabetic effects. Bioactive ingredients such as proteins, lipids, polysaccharides, alkaloids, terpenoids, lactones, lectins, sterols, and phenolic components make functional foods, and these chemicals are therapeutically useful. In mushrooms, β-glucan, a carbohydrate, is widespread. Boosting β-cell insulin release restores pancreatic tissue function and lowers blood glucose levels (Shamim et al., 2023 ). It was found that the hypoglycemic effects of Pleurotus  sp. methanolic extract in rats with streptozotocin-induced type-2 diabetes. The high-dose mushroom extract group had lower fasting blood glucose and serum catalase activity than the untreated group. The aforementioned groups had significant serum insulin increases (Sheng et al., 2019 ).  5.3 Antimicrobial effects Mushrooms are widely recognized as highly beneficial nutritional supplements, possessing remarkable medicinal properties. Certain species of edible mushrooms exhibit antimicrobial properties, which enable them to effectively regulate the growth and spread of various pathogenic microorganisms that can cause diseases in humans (Panda & Gupta, 2018 ). These organisms were discovered to exhibit anti-fungal and anti-bacterial properties against highly resistant pathogenic microorganisms. Inonotus hispidus , as well as various mushrooms, have been observed to contain phenolic compounds and ergosterol peroxide. These compounds have been shown to exhibit anti-viral effects against influenza viruses in laboratory settings (Panda & Gupta, 2021 ; Wang, Feng, et al., 2022 ). Lentinula edodes  exhibited superior antimicrobial activity in comparison to other mushroom species, as per the reported findings. Research conducted a screening of the culture filtrates derived from 27 edible mushrooms to evaluate their potential antimicrobial properties. The filtrates obtained from Lentinula edodes  were observed to exhibit complete inhibition of spore germination in Colletotrichum higginsianum . The culture filtrates derived from G. lucidum  and Lentinus edodes  mushrooms have been observed to effectively impede the germination process of spores in Alternaria brassicicola  (Kumar et al., 2021 ). Hence, the bioactive constituents derived from mushrooms exhibit promising potential for development into biocontrol agents targeting diverse plant diseases. In many study, it has been observe that, wild edible/medicinal mushroom including Geastrum rubellum, Amanita vaginata, Conocybe apala, Leucocoprinus cretatus  and Marasmieus haematocephalus  has reported with potential bioactivity (Panda & Gupta, 2018 ; Panda & Mishra, 2021 ). The findings suggest that mushrooms exhibit potential for pharmaceutical applications in the therapeutic management of various ailments. In a study, it was documented that mushroom extracts are utilized as potential food additives due to their notable antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. This application addresses the escalating need for enhanced food quality and safety measures, effectively mitigating the risk of food product spoilage (Kim et al., 2022 ).  5.4 Antioxidant effects Because antioxidants are found in many different kinds of foods, they can effectively get rid of free radicals and stop the oxidative changes that can lead to many degenerative diseases. Whole grains, vegetables, fruits, spices, tea, and herbs harbour a plethora of inherent natural antioxidants. Mushrooms, due to their presence of phenolic compounds and various polysaccharides, have been acknowledged as a bountiful reservoir of antioxidant constituents. It has been seen that adding edible mushrooms to a diet can reduce oxidative stress by making antioxidant defences stronger (Gao et al., 2023 ; Navarro-Simarro et al., 2024 ). Mushrooms, whether they are grown under controlled conditions or found in their natural habitat, exhibit notable antioxidant properties. These properties primarily arise from the presence of bioactive constituents, including polyphenolic compounds, carotenoids, polysaccharides, and vitamins. Edible mushrooms have become increasingly popular as a gastronomic delight because of their high antioxidant and bioactive component content (Kumar et al., 2021 ). It has elucidated the in vitro  capacity of mushroom cell wall polysaccharides to scavenge free radicals, highlighting their remarkable antioxidant potential. Hence, the incorporation of mushrooms into one's daily dietary regimen as a means of accessing natural antioxidants could potentially confer benefits in terms of mitigating or diminishing oxidative harm and other ailments associated with modern life-styles (Arunachalam et al., 2022 ). The ability of P. ostreatus  extracts to scavenge free radicals, reduce Fe3+ , and chelate Fe2+  demonstrated their antioxidant characteristics. P. ostreatus  can get rid of many types of free radicals, such as DPPH, hydroxyl radicals, nitric oxide, and hydrogen peroxide. This property could be useful in medicine and biology for many reasons, like protecting important cell macromolecules, lowering the production of free radicals, and stopping oxidative stress (Effiong et al., 2024 ). Wild edible mushrooms, particularly Clavatia craniiformis,  have DPPH activity (0.335 ± 0.001 mg abscorbic acid equivalents/g dry weight) and ABTS (10.44 ± 0.34 mg abscorbic acid equivalents/g dw), suggesting they may have antioxidant capabilities that could be beneficial (Bisht et al., 2024 ). The gallic acid equivalents (GAE) of Cordyceps militaris, Amanita caesarea, Lentinula edodes,  and Clitocybe geotropa  were established to be 37.04 ± 0.35, 52.04 ± 0.41, 19.33 ± 0.11, and 21.63 ± 0.15 mg GAE/g, respectively, when measured using a methanolic extract. A possible antioxidant action of these mushrooms is directly related to this (Karadeniz et al., 2024 ).  5.5 Cardiovascular effects Cardiovascular diseases are linked to hypercholesterolemia, which is when there is too much cholesterol in the blood, and low-density lipophilic oxidation, which is when lipids with a low density are oxidized. Additionally, atherosclerosis, the buildup of plaque within arterial walls, is also associated with these disorders. Hence, it is imperative to maintain homeostasis in blood cholesterol levels in order to both prevent and treat this condition. The notable attributes of edible mushrooms, containing low fat and high fiber, position them as a highly favourable dietary option for the mitigation of cardiac ailments. Edible mushrooms are often suggested in oriental medicine as a natural hypocholesterolemic and anti-sclerotic dietary supplement (Krittanawong et al., 2021 ). Using Termitomyces microcarpus  mushrooms has been shown to reduce the number of diseases linked to high blood lipids by a significant amount. Additionally, it has been postulated that the substantial fibre content present in these mushrooms may contribute to the reduction of total serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides (Paloi et al., 2023 ). In a study, a biologically active compound with hypocholesterolemic properties known as eritadenine [2(R), 3(R)-dihydroxy-4-(9-adenyl)-butyric acid] has been successfully isolated and this compound was found in the shiitake mushroom. Eritadenine, a compound found in certain organisms, has been observed to have the ability to reduce serum cholesterol levels in mice. This reduction is achieved by enhancing the elimination of ingested cholesterol and facilitating its metabolic breakdown (Anusiya et al., 2021 ).  5.6 Hepatoprotective effects Oxidative stress causes fibrosis, chronic hepatitis, hepatocellular cancer, and cirrhosis in the liver. Pharmaceuticals and other non-infectious agents can cause hepatotoxicity. During the galactosamine-induced cytotoxic test, the ganoderic acids from G. lucidum  kept the rat hepatocytes from getting hurt. Ganoderma frondosa  and Lentinus edodes  extract at 100 mg/kg lowered the paracetamol-caused increase in alanine and aspartate transaminases. Tricholoma lobayense  mycelial aqueous extracts were hepatoprotective at 300 mg/kg body weight. The polysaccharide-rich Pleurotus eryngii  extract has hepatoprotective and hypolipidemic properties, making it a promising functional food ingredient. Agaricus blazei  extracts prevent paracetamol-induced liver damage (Soares et al., 2013 ). Ganoderma lucidum  is a fascinating bacterium with 400 chemicals. Tri-terpenoids, polysaccharides, ergosterols, nucleosides, proteins, peptides, fatty acids, and trace elements are hepatoprotective. The bioactivity and hepatoprotective effects of exquisite triterpenoids and polysaccharides are noteworthy. Triterpenoids inhibit β-glucuronidase, a reliable marker for hepatic damage (Kumar et al., 2021 ).  5.7 Antiviral effects Mushrooms may play a critical role in the immune system activation of macrophages, NK cell formation, CD4 cell development, and complement system activation by their b-glucans. By persistently reducing viral replication and inflammatory mediators, macrophages combat chronic inflammation and HIV infection (De Marco Castro et al., 2021 ). Several triterpenes found in Ganoderma lucidum  have shown promise as antiviral medications or as agents to boost the immune system and prevent the replication of HIV type 1 protease, according to research. Several mushroom components, such as b-glucans, flavonoids, glycoproteins, triterpenoids, nucleosides, and melanin pigments, have shown strong antiviral effects (Claus-Desbonnet et al., 2022 ). Due to their high mineral content, which may have an indirect or direct influence on their anti-influenza effects, mushrooms are a great way to boost your immune system, prevent flu infections, and maintain homeostasis in your body (Zhang, Zhang, & Ling, 2022 ). There was a significant decrease in the incidence of cervical abnormalities, such as the recurrence of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and high-risk Human papillomaviruses (HPV), a form of malignancy, after one year of supplementation with biomass from the Coriolus versicolor  plant. After six months of treatment, active hexose correlated compound (AHCC), a fermented extract of Lentinula edodes mycelia, effectively eradicated 60% of infections in women who tested positive for HPV (Cortés Bordoy et al., 2023 ). Investigations into the role of mushrooms in this pandemic are still in their infancy. The FDA has approved the use of Fomitopsis officinalis  and Coriolus versicolor , two types of polypore mushrooms, for human clinical studies. These mushrooms are known to produce a wide range of cytokine responses. Research has shown that the naturally occurring Cordyceps militaris and Cordyceps sinensis , which possess immunomodulatory properties, could be useful in the fight against and treatment of COVID-19 (Slomski, 2021 ). Recent research has shown that Inonotus obliquus , or Chaga polysaccharides, can be an effective antiviral agent, especially when combined with anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations and drugs. The S1 spike glycoprotein found on their envelope enables coronaviruses to infect host cells. Some parts of the Chaga protein connect with the S-terminal domains of SARS-CoV-2 receptors to limit the virus's access to the host's shelter cell (Eid et al., 2021 ). Therefore, this date proves that wild and edible mushrooms have antiviral characteristics and could be utilized as possible antiviral drugs or vaccines.   6 Challenges and opportunities Pharmacotherapy based on structural analogues and natural products has a long history of success, and due to its reliability in treating and controlling a variety of chronic conditions, it is becoming more popular. Mushrooms are supposed to be the functional food of the future because of all the ways they help people stay healthy: as pharma nutrients, nutraceuticals, and regular functional foods. Despite their market longevity, little is known about the differences in the health effects of fresh mushrooms, mushroom extracts, and biomass dietary supplements (Hamza et al., 2024 ). The matter becomes more intricate because more evaluation is needed to determine the health risk associated with each species of mushroom, taking into account their wide molecular diversity and unique biological traits. The various bioactive chemicals found in mushrooms have not yet been thoroughly studied for their potential medicinal uses (Elnahas et al., 2024 ). More research is needed to fill this uncertainty. The success and safety of future pre- and clinical trials depend on the results of fresh toxicological investigations. Cultivating mushrooms under tightly controlled conditions and reaching a substantial biomass is the most challenging part of producing mushrooms as functional foods that are ready to eat and looking into their potential as pharmaceutical and nutraceutical products. Prior to contemplating commercialization, it is crucial to guarantee the availability of an appropriate environment and the continuous, year-round harvest of healthy mushroom species. Research has shown that certain types of mushrooms may have future benefits; however, these mushrooms are either only available at certain times of the year or found in nature, making them difficult to cultivate. The mushroom-based industry can still benefit from further advances in genetics and proteomics, which could lead to a bridge that leverages mushrooms' benefits.  7 Conclusions and future trends There has been extensive research into the benefits of prebiotics for human health. Nowadays, it is not difficult to find foods that contain prebiotics. These include a variety of baked foods, cereal bars, spreads, chocolates, sauces, beverages, health drinks, and even baby milk formulas. When developing a new prebiotic from common materials such as mushrooms, it is critical to consider factors such as availability and cost. Mushrooms are a fantastic food choice since they include numerous important nutrients and bioactive components while being low in calories, fat, sodium, and cholesterol. Producing them may have fewer negative environmental repercussions than producing livestock. In addition, they share many flavor and sensory traits with meat and seafood. As a result, they are an extremely valuable functional component for generating musculoskeletal food products with better dietary and environmental properties. The great majority of edible mushroom species have not been evaluated for their suitability in human diets. These new mushroom species may differ from traditionally cultivated varieties in how they affect human health, the senses, and the environment. Hence, studying these additional species is essential. Since the polysaccharides in mushrooms have been shown to have immunomodulating properties, antitumor activities, antiviral activity, and anticancer activities, including their incorporation into meals is highly beneficial. Now a days, mushrooms are also being used in food packaging through the formulation of a polysaccharide-nano catalyst. There are many mushrooms producing polysaccharides, which are reported from many mushroom species. It is required to study more on those mushroom polysaccharides for diversified food packaging.Mushrooms extract has both a prebiotic effect and a therapeutic effect, and both will be appreciated by consumers. It must be backed up by extensive in vitro  and in vivo  research. Mushroom extract flavour, which may influence the final product's sensory qualities, warrants additional research and evaluation. Mushroom use in muscle foods is projected to rise as a result of rising customer demand for healthier and more sustainable/functional foods. With these very crucial potentials in food and medicine, mushroom resources will be an important part of achieving sustainable development goals.
