                  It has been widely recognized that progress toward achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) must be better harmonized with Ecosystem Services (ESs) to tackle global challenges. In China, the National Key Ecological Function Areas (NKEFAs) were set up as one of the ecological fiscal transfer projects. Despite its significant influences on the SDGs-ESs nexus, there is a lack of empirical studies on the effects and mechanisms of policy. In response, this study provides a synthesized framework that incorporates the coupling coordination degree between the Urban Sustainable Development Goals (USDGs) and Ecosystem Services Scores (ESSs), empirically verifies the policy effect using the difference-in-differences model, and then further investigates the mechanisms of government action to coordinate urban SDGs and ESs. The results show that: (1) The coupling coordination degree between USDGs and ESSs varies significantly across different regions but steadily increases over time, with a faster increasing rate of coordination degree growth in NKEEFAs pilot cities compared to non-pilot cities. (2) The policy has demonstrated benefits in coordinating USDGs and ESSs with a coefficient of 0.005. In detail, the policy enhances ESSs but concurrently exerts a negative influence on USDGs, with coefficients are 0.008 and −0.004 respectively, suggesting an uneven distribution of the policy's impacts. (3) The study unveils the 'technological innovation effect' and the 'industrial agglomeration effect' as crucial mediating pathways for policy effect, laying a solid foundation for USDGs and ESSs coordination. In total, the study highlights the critical need to account for regional development disparities and adequate funding in ecological protection policies to ensure fairness and effectiveness from a central decision-making standpoint. It recommends enhancing transparency in fiscal expenditures and fostering regional joint coordination to address local government challenges. These insights from this study can offer valuable guidance for policymakers to refine policy implementation and promote the coordination of regional ESs and SDGs.

School of Economics and Management, Northeast Forestry University Harbin Heilongjiang China       It has been widely recognized that progress toward achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) must be better harmonized with Ecosystem Services (ESs) to tackle global challenges. In China, the National Key Ecological Function Areas (NKEFAs) were set up as one of the ecological fiscal transfer projects. Despite its significant influences on the SDGs-ESs nexus, there is a lack of empirical studies on the effects and mechanisms of policy. In response, this study provides a synthesized framework that incorporates the coupling coordination degree between the Urban Sustainable Development Goals (USDGs) and Ecosystem Services Scores (ESSs), empirically verifies the policy effect using the difference-in-differences model, and then further investigates the mechanisms of government action to coordinate urban SDGs and ESs. The results show that: (1) The coupling coordination degree between USDGs and ESSs varies significantly across different regions but steadily increases over time, with a faster increasing rate of coordination degree growth in NKEEFAs pilot cities compared to non-pilot cities. (2) The policy has demonstrated benefits in coordinating USDGs and ESSs with a coefficient of 0.005. In detail, the policy enhances ESSs but concurrently exerts a negative influence on USDGs, with coefficients are 0.008 and −0.004 respectively, suggesting an uneven distribution of the policy's impacts. (3) The study unveils the 'technological innovation effect' and the 'industrial agglomeration effect' as crucial mediating pathways for policy effect, laying a solid foundation for USDGs and ESSs coordination. In total, the study highlights the critical need to account for regional development disparities and adequate funding in ecological protection policies to ensure fairness and effectiveness from a central decision-making standpoint. It recommends enhancing transparency in fiscal expenditures and fostering regional joint coordination to address local government challenges. These insights from this study can offer valuable guidance for policymakers to refine policy implementation and promote the coordination of regional ESs and SDGs.

The United Nations has introduced the 2030 Agenda, comprising 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aiming at addressing global issues such as poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation, to create a more sustainable, equitable, and prosperous future in this context (Nations, 2015 ). However, the integrated, indivisible, and intertwined natures of the 17 SDGs, as well as the conflicts between goals, for instance, economic and climate goals, can cause off course in achieving the 17 SDGs by 2030 (Zeng and Maxwell, 2020; Wu and Fu, 2023 ). Especially some socio-economic indicators are embedded in the biodiversity conservation goals, such as SDGs 6 and 13–15 (Folke and Biggs, 2016 ), suggesting that many of these indicators fail to reflect environmental conservation efforts but may instead serve as a smokescreen for ecosystem degradation (Zeng and Maxwell, 2020 ). With the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restorations (2021–2030) getting underway (Hua and Bruijnzeel, 2022 ), the fundamental role of ecosystem services (ESs) is highlighted in achieving these goals (Sachs and Schmidt-Traub, 2019; Yin and Zhao, 2021 ). ESs are the flows of materials, energy, and information from natural capital stocks and are vital to human welfare (Costanza and D'Arge, 1997 ), which also correspond to many of the SDGs. Even though there is a close relationship, the SDGs-ESs nexus remains highly complex and underexplored. Moreover, the comprehensive evaluation of ESs and SDGs indicated an inconsistency in the spatial distribution of their high-value areas (Xu and Peng, 2022 ), highlighting a notable mismatch between the SDGs' progress and the actual environmental status. This discrepancy has led to a debate over whether the apparent progress towards SDGs in various countries truly benefits and coordinates with ecological protection. Given these points, it is crucial to identify the deviations in direction and details within progress from the perspective of ecological protection. These deviations could indeed undermine the SDGs' original goal of harmonizing environmental protection with socio-economic development, even if current progress seems promising (Zeng and Maxwell, 2020 ). Another inherent complexity of the SDGs-ESs nexus arises from spatial variations. The distinct political, economic, ecological, and cultural contexts of different regions can result in varying outcomes and responses to policies aimed at improving SDG or ESs performance, thereby complicating efforts to meet these goals globally (Xu and Peng, 2022 ). Understanding how countries navigate these challenges and the inside region-level patterns is crucial for the global pursuit of sustainable development. China, teeming with rich biodiversity and varied ecosystems, has proactively established the National Key Ecological Function Areas (NKEFAs) nationwide, a land use regulation designed to foster nature conservation in regions marked by either vulnerable or abundant biodiversity. This strategic land use regulation is a testament to China's commitment to adopting and implementing ambitious policies that align with all SDGs and contributing to global ecosystem restoration and climate change. Notably, some pilot areas with pronounced ESs usually overlap with regions experiencing higher poverty levels. Yet, formal environmental regulations often entail high implementation costs and the opportunity cost of foregone development resulting from measures (Droste and Ring, 2018; Bai and Hu, 2023 ), indicating that conservation efforts might levy substantial economic burdens on local communities. Indeed, the intricacies of social-ecological systems in specific contexts may determine how policy is interpreted locally to produce outcomes (Selva and Pauli, 2019 ). As economic, industrial, and eco-environmental factors all respond to the NKEFA policy, the question of whether government strategy policy can ensure actual ecosystem improvements and align SDGs and ESs needs more evidence. However, further analysis of the NKEFAs' impact and its mechanisms with regard to the SDGs-ESs nexus remains unclear. Filling these knowledge gaps, the findings hold significant theoretical and practical implications in the field of SDGs achievement and ecological policy implementation by addressing the following questions: Does ESs coordinate with the progress toward SDGs at the city level? Does introducing the NKEFAs incentivize municipal responses to reconciling progress towards SDGs with concrete ecosystem protection, and how can it be quantified? What are the underpinning mechanisms through which NKEFAs serve a function? A synthesized model provided that ESs represent ecological indicators as a suite of external measures to investigate thoroughly if the progress of SDGs really protects the environment utilizing the coupled coordination degree model, which can offer a micro insight into the spatio-temporal evolution of the relationship between SDGs and ESs across 188 Chinese cities from 2006 to 2019. Then, the difference-in-differences method was introduced to provide evidence of NKEFA policy's effects and unveil policy pathways for coordinating SDGs and ESs. The remaining structure of this study is arranged as follows: Section 2  provides a theoretical framework for exploring the impact of NKEFAs policy on SDGs-ESs nexus. Section 3  outlines the data sources, variables, and methodology used in the study. Section 4  presents the study results. Section 5  offers the discussion and reflection on strategies to optimize policy implementation. Finally, Section 6  provides the conclusions.  2 Theoretical framework China's Major Function Oriented Zoning Scheme of 2010 categorizes land use into four types, of which the NKEFAs adhere to policies of ecological protection and restricted high-intensity development. It is one of China's most groundbreaking and enduring government ecological fiscal transfers (EFT) (Cao and Li, 2022 ), substantially influencing SDGs, ESs, and their relationship (Tan and Liu, 2022 ). 2.1 Direct effect of the NKEFAs policy There is a dual nature of the NKEFAs policy for SDGs realization (Selva and Pauli, 2019 ). Firstly, given the general-purpose EFT payments accompanying the NKEFAs policy, to those local governments that have NKEFAs issued by the central government to compensate for expenditures and exemplary performance in eco-environmental protection and restoration (Busch and Ring, 2021; Chen and Hou, 2024 ). The EFT directly increases the fiscal strength of regions, leading to improvements in local infrastructure such as public transportation and health facilities (Busch and Ring, 2021 ), thereby contributing to the progress towards urban SDGs locally. Moreover, the environmental monitoring in the NKEFAs requires enterprises to curb pollution emissions and achieve cleaner manufacturing (Du and Cheng, 2021 ), attracting the enterprises' innovation activities as put forward by Porter (Porter, 1991 ), which can also promote the regional process to SDGs. Still, the negative list for market access for industrial and the strict regulation of all types of exploitation activities, as well as the increasing costs of pollution prevention and control within the NKEFAs, potentially impede rapid economic growth and the influx of heavy industry enterprises for a period, impeding the achievement of socioeconomic SDGs. As for ecosystem protection, the NKEFAs services as key function zones related to the national ecological security at its inception, emphasizing the enhancement of regional ecological products and service functions and the improvement of eco-environment quality, with its role in water conservation, biodiversity maintenance, windbreak, and sand-shifting control, as well as help to carbon neutrality (Jin and Jiang, 2023 ). Yet, ecosystem improvement is a gradual process that takes years, and significant changes in the short term may not be evident (Cao and Qi, 2021 ). Furthermore, pursuing economic development complicates the diversity of policy implementation pathways and outcomes at the administrative level. Given the positive externalities of ecological conservation, local officials might manipulate policy intentions to secure political gains. Hence, the actual effectiveness of eco-environmental protection in the NKEFAs requires further verification (de Paulo and Camões, 2021; Gong and Zhang, 2021 ). Given the above context, the following hypotheses are proposed:Hypothesis 1 Establishing the NKEFAs positively impacts urban SDGs and ESs.  Hypothesis 2 Establishing the NKEFAs can facilitate the enhancement of coordination between urban SDGs and ESs.    2.2 The mechanism analysis of mediators (1) Technological innovation effect According to the Porter hypothesis, environmentally sound policies are typically thought to favor technological innovation (Zhao and Cao, 2022; Bai and Hu, 2023 ), but there are divergent opinions that environmental policies can increase business expenses and thus inhibit technological innovation (Tarui and Polasky, 2005; Yang and Xie, 2022 ). In this study, technological innovation mediates the impact of NKEFAs. Stringent industrial access standards in the NKEFAs will encourage the shift away from extensive development models, leading to productivity enhancements through technological innovation. This should reduce resource consumption and environmental pollution in turn, facilitate a shift in development models, and lessen the constraints of resource and environmental factors on economic growth. One of the goals is to ascertain whether establishing the NKEFAs puts a positive forward to technological and innovation progress, consequently facilitating the coordination between ESs and SDGs. (2) Industrial agglomeration effect The NKEFAs enforce strict limitations on exploitation, promoting the concentration of industries, human capital, and economic capital in urbanized and development-encouraged regions, thus improving the efficiency of spatial land allocation and stimulating the flow and allocation of factor resources in industrial clusters. Such agglomeration is conducive to achieving economies of scale, accelerating market integration, and efficient resource utilization, positively affecting the ecological environment. Based on the analysis of the mechanism, the third hypothesis of the mediating mechanism is proposed:Hypothesis 3 The NKEFAs can improve the degree of coupling and coordination between urban SDGs and ESs by supporting industrial agglomeration and technological innovation.     3 Materials and methods 3.1 Study area and data sources China, with its vast area and diverse ecosystems, has made substantial efforts for its ecological conservation. However, as a developing country with a rapid economic growth rate, there are huge challenges to its conservation effects as they can be constrained in terms of urbanization and industrialization. Despite the challenges, NKEFAs, as one of the most impactful policies nationally, tried to address the dilemma. Originated from China's Major Function Oriented Zoning scheme in 2010, which covers 436 county-level administrative regions, it then included an additional 240 counties (cities, districts, and banners) in the list in 2016, with a total area of over 5 million square kilometers, accounting for 53 % of the territory area. Moreover, most counties (cities, districts) included in NKEFAs are those that especially lag in economic development. This complexity, coupled with extensive data, offers a valuable opportunity for in-depth analysis. Therefore, the unique outcomes of the NKEFAs policy in such complex contexts are worth exploring. The sample size for this study comprises panel data for 188 Chinese mainland cities from 2006 to 2019, which is 2632. The primary data used in this study included: (1) socio-economic data was obtained from the Chinese Urban Statistical Yearbooks and the Chinese Urban Construction Statistical Yearbooks; (2) the China land cover dataset (CLCD) developed by Professors Yang Jie and Huang Xin's team at Wuhan University, and it is implemented on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform (Yang and Huang, 2021 ); (3) the Digital Elevation Model data (DEM) was downloaded from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) GTOPO30 production; (4) the soil data was downloaded from the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD); (5) the monthly and annual rainfall data was downloaded from the National Qinghai Tibet Plateau Scientific Data Center; (6) the evapotranspiration data, sourced from the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center; (7) the level of technological innovation and the index of industrial agglomeration were downloaded from Data Set on Population Agglomeration, Economic Agglomeration, Industrial Agglomeration, and Green Economic Efficiency of 282 Prefectural Cities in China from 2004 to 2020 (Liao, 2023 ). Using ArcGIS 10.7, this research transformed all spatial geographic data into the uniform projection coordinate system of Krasovsky_1940_Albers and resampled it at a spatial resolution of 1000 m.  3.2 Variables 3.2.1 Indicator of urban sustainable development goals evaluation Scientific monitoring and assessment of progress is crucial to the realization of SDGs. Zheng Yang et al. (Yang and Xie, 2022 ) categorized SDGs from a process perspective and classified them into different categories, including Sustainability Basis (SDGs 1, 2, 9, 11, and 12), Sustainability Acceleration (SDG 4) and Sustainability Environment (SDGs 3, 8, 9, and 11), which helps in evaluating the SDGs in regional areas. Barbier and Burgess (Barbier and Burgess, 2017 ) illustrated how each of the 17 SDGs can be characterized as a goal primarily attributed either to the environmental, economic, or social system. Klopp and Petretta (Klopp and Petretta, 2017 ) raised critical thinking around selecting the indicators and the practical use, in which the uptake and context-specific application of the goal by diverse actors in widely different cities, called "localization." The localization suggests that indicators for assessing SDGs vary depending on different research questions, and the international macrolevel SDGs framework should be applied to assessments at regional levels with adjustments concerning the differences in statistical systems (Shao and Chen, 2021 ). Urban SDGs assessments related to the NKEFAs policy need to be more targeted, responsive to policies, reflect policy dynamics, and require data that is concise and usable. Inspired by the above literature, the urban SDGs evaluation indicator system (shown in  Table 1 ) is primarily concentrated in five specific sub-goals: SDG1 (No Poverty), SDG6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), and SDG11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). In this system, considering the availability of data at the city level (Schmidt-Traub and Kroll, 2017 ), 21 proxy indicators are embodied in three pillars: "Economic, Employment, and Industry," "Livelihood Security and Well-being," and "Urban Construction and Infrastructure" to reflect the average effect of the NKEFAs policy.  3.2.2 Indicator of ecosystem services evaluation The Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model was co-developed by Stanford University, The Nature Conservancy (TNC), and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) in 2007 (Sharp and N, 2015; Xiao and Zhou, 2023 ). The InVEST model is a suite of spatially explicit integrated models that can used to value and map multitudinous ecosystem services. These models are easy to use and have minimal data demands (Xu and Peng, 2022 ), so they can be used in any scenario and align with the research objectives for this study. Four kinds of ESs were selected in this study: the Annual Water Yield model, the Sediment Delivery Ratio (SDR) model, the Carbon Storage and Sequestration model, and the Habitat Quality model, to portray the general quality of ecosystems in the study areas holistically. (1) Carbon sequestration evaluation Carbon sequestration in the ecosystem is the progress of capturing and sequestering carbon into carbon pools for prolonged durations (Babbar and Areendran, 2021 ). Based on the principle of carbon pools (soil organic carbon, belowground biomass, aboveground biomass, dead organic matter) own distinct carbon stock, the InVEST Carbon Storage and Sequestration model (version 3.13.0) utilizes land use and land cover to quantify the carbon storage over the years. This research aggregated the amount of carbon sequestration in three of four carbon pools based on landscape maps from 2006 to 2019 to model carbon stocks of ecosystems. The dead organic matter was excluded as its contribution is relatively small compared with the other three carbon pools. The carbon density of carbon pools for land use types was sourced from the China National Ecosystem Research Network Land Ecosystem Carbon Density Dataset.1  1 http://www.cnern.org.cn    Carbon density data within the latitude and longitude range of the study area were selected, and by applying outlier removal and averaging methods, as informed by the literature, the final carbon density for the study area was obtained. (2) Habitant maintenance assessment The InVEST Habitat Quality model (version 3.13.0) has been broadly applied to measure habitat maintenance capacity due to its straightforward operation and strong data availability. This model primarily comprises four factors: the level of each threat, each habitat type's sensitivity to each threat, the distance between the habitant and the threat, and the strength of legal protection for the habitant (Li and Zhou, 2021; Xiao and Zhou, 2023 ). There is growing evidence to support that the most predominant impact of all factors on the ecological environment are activities and production of humankind (Foster and Love, 2017 ), thereby three threat sources selected in our study, namely cropland, barren land, and impervious land (Chen and Liu, 2023 ). (3) Water yield evaluation The InVEST water yield model (version 3.13.0), which originated from the Budyko hydrothermal coupling equilibrium hypothesis (Donohue and Roderick, 2012 ), has been applied around the world over a long period. This model takes land use and land cover, precipitation, soil maximum root burial depth, root depth, plant available water content, and evapotranspiration as the main reference factors (Yang and Zhan, 2022 ). (4) Soil conservation evaluation The InVEST Sediment Delivery Ratio (SDR) model can be evaluated based on the gap between potential and actual soil erosion (Aneseyee and Elias, 2020; Batista and Laceby, 2021 ). The calculation applied the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE). The parameters required in this model include the digital elevation model (DEM), land cover data, soil erodibility (K), and rainfall erosivity index (R). Threshold flow accumulation was obtained through hydrological analysis in ArcGIS (version 10.7).   3.3 Methodology After determining the specific indicators for urban SDGs and ESs, the raw data was handled to eliminate the impact of different dimensions and magnitudes. A combination of subjective and objective weighting methods was used to obtain the weights for 21 urban SDGs indicators across three pillars, and the annual urban SDGs scores (USDGs) for each city were calculated. Similarly, the weights for four ESs indicators were generated, and the composite ESs scores (ESSs) were calculated. The composite score assessment is compromising and better reflects the development and changes of urban SDGs and ESs (See Supplementary S2 . An Integrated Approach for USDGs and ESSs). 3.3.1 The coupling coordination degree model The coupling coordination model (CCDM) is a quantitative analysis of the close relationship between two or more systems and the extent of the development (Yang and Zeng, 2020 ). In this research, the CCDM was constructed using the following Eq. (1) - Eq. (2)  to figure out the relationship between USDGs and ESSs at temporal and spatial levels.(1) C = 2 × ESSs × USDGs  ESSs + USDGs    2        1  2         Where C is the coupling level of USDGs and ESSs with a value range of [0,1], the higher the coupling level, the more powerfully interconnected the urban sustainable development and ecosystem services would be (Li and Sun, 2021 ), which forms the basis for the subsequent analysis of coordination levels. That is, it only makes sense to analyze the coordination between USDGs and ESSs if there is a strong correlation. However, the characteristics of this correlation are still unclear, even if the strength of the relationship is determined. The question is whether the interaction between USDGs and ESSs is strongly positive and mutually enhancing or is strongly antagonistic. The former implies that the SDGs-Ess system is progressing in a stable and positive direction, but the latter means that any progress in SDGs goals at the expense of Ess, leading to the crisis under the façade of high SDGs scores progress described in the introduction. To this end, degrees of coupling coordination are needed.(2) D = C × T     T = α × USDGs + β × ESSs          Where D is the coupling coordination degree of USDGs and ESSs, serving as the core variable in the difference-in-differences model. α and β are the weight coefficients for USDGs and ESSs, respectively, α = β = 1 / 2   . D characterizes the SDGs-ESs nexus attribute and shapes the evolution trend (Shi and Yang, 2020 ). Furthermore, D of a certain interval is subordinated to the same type according to the established study (Cui and Chen, 2019 ); (Li and Sun, 2021 ): D ∈ [0, 0.2], severe imbalance; D∈(0.2, 0.4], slight imbalance; D∈(0.4, 0.6], basic coordination; D∈(0.6, 0.8], moderate coordination; D∈(0.8, 1.0], good coordination.  3.3.2 The difference-in-differences model The difference-in-differences (DID) model is a promising instrument in the social sciences to explore causal effects between policy and one subject, for it can address endogeneity issues effectively to capture the micro-level impacts of the policy (Rios-Avila and Sant'Anna, 2023; Roth and Sant Anna, 2023; Wang, 2023 ). In this research, as the timing of the NKEFAs policy impacts varies, it is suitable to use a multi-period DID model. The key to the model is to build a reasonable "treatment group" and "control group." Since the list is based on the county level, what determines whether a city can be set in the "treatment group" is if it contains any counties that enjoyed the transfer payments. Panel data for 188 prefectural-level and above cities in China from 2006 to 2019 were collected considering data availability; 40 cities were set as the treatment group, while 148 cities were in the control group. Using the DID method, the average treatment effect is empirically estimated by comparing the changes in the coupling coordination degree between USDGs and ESSs in the pilot and control cities (Cheng and Chen, 2021 ). With reference to (He and Wang, 2024 ), the model constructed to test Hypotheses 1 and 2:(3) y  it   = α  1   + β  1   did  it   + δ  1   control  it   + μ  i   + γ  t   + ε  it       Where y  it     is the dependent variable, originating from USDGs, ESSs, and the coupling coordination degree between USDGs and ESSs of the city i in year t; did  is the dummy variable for the establishment of NKEFAs, serving as the core explanatory variable. Specifically, it equals 1 if the city sets as "treatment group" in year "t" when it enjoys the transfer payment; otherwise, it is 0; control  it     represents a series of control variables that can influence the USDGs and ESSs, including urbanization rate (UR) and the level of urban openness (OPEN); μ  i    , γ  t     are the time-fixed effect and regional-fixed effect respectively, which can not only demonstrate the effects of treatment and time but also help to control for unobserved events or characteristics (Cheng and Chen, 2021 ). The Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) of the DID model means that policy interventions only affect the treatment group and do not interact with the control group (Rubin, 1974 ), and it is violated when the spatial correlation is considered. In this study, as the global Moran’s I  index and local Moran’s I  index show that the dependent variable has spatial correlation, a model considered spatial correlation is included for comparison with the basic DID model to ensure the robustness of the results. First, the parallel trends test passed, indicating that the NKEFAs policy is quasi-exogenous. Secondly, combining the LR test and Wald test, it is shown that selecting the Spatial Autoregressive DID model (SAR-DID) is more suitable for this study, with the specific form presented below (Details of Tests See Supplementary S4 . Spatial Econometric Test):(4) y  it   = α  4   + β  4   did  it   + δ  4   control  it   + θ  1   W  ij   y  it   + θ  2   W  ij   control + μ  i   + γ  t   + ε  it        Compared to Eq. (3), a  spatial contiguity matrix W  ij     was added, i and j present the spatial units, W  ij    =1 if i and j are adjacent; otherwise, W  ij    =0 (LeSage and Pace, 2010 ). θ  1     is the spatial correlation coefficient of the dependent variables, representing the influence of the degree of neighboring regions on the local area. θ  2     reflects the spillover effects of the control variables.(5) IN  it   = α  2   + β  2   did  it   + δ  2   control  it   + μ  i   + γ  t   + ε  it       (6) y  it   = α  3   + β  3   did  it   + φ IN  it   + δ  3   control  it   + μ  i   + γ  t   + ε  it        And mediating variables were introduced to explore the mechanisms of policy impact, as shown in Eq. (5)  - Eq. (6) , IN  it     is the mediating variables composed of the industrial agglomeration effect (Ind) and technological innovation effect (Tec).( Fig. 1 )    4 Results 4.1 Spatio-temporal evolution of the SDGs-ESs nexus A graph was mapped to track differences and changes in the coupling coordination degree (D) over different periods in the control and treatment groups ( Fig. 2 ). There was a steady increase in the degree of both groups, with the mean value of D, which shaped as the black horizontal line in the box plot in Fig. 2 , fluctuating upward. Notably, the mean value of D in the treatment group was significantly lower than that of the control group in 2006 and had slightly surpassed by 2019, validating the policy's benefits on SDGs-ESs nexus in pilot areas in a preliminary manner.  Fig. 3  presents the spatial changes of D in 2006, 2009, 2015, and 2019. It is discernible in the figure that from 2006 to 2009, there were no significant changes in the overall degree of coupling coordination. This period was characterized by the majority of regions exhibiting basic coordination (0.4,0.6], and a lack of areas with good coordination (D>0.8). Between 2009 and 2015, changes began to emerge; most of the regions previously exhibited basic coordination, transitioning to a higher coupling coordination degree (0.6,0.8]. From 2015–2019, numerous areas displaying good coordination (D>0.8) emerged, predominantly in the southeastern coastal regions. At all periods, even cities with poor performance had a D value of no less than 0.4 (basic coordination). In contrast, some cities had values between 0.8 and 0.9, showing good coordination. Therefore, marked spatial variations were evident in the degree of coupling coordination between USDGs and ESSs across cities.  4.2 The benchmarking effects of the NKEFAs policy  Table 2  shows the benchmarking effect of the NKEFAs policy in Hypotheses 1 and 2. The DID is the result of the basic DID model of Eq. (3) , and the SAR-DID is the result of the model considering the spatial autocorrelation of Eq. (4) . The estimated coefficients are statistically significant. The policy could conspicuously improve ESs as the coefficients are 0.008 of basic DID and 0.002 of SAR-DID in column (1). However, the coefficient of −0.004 in both models shows that the NKEFA policy negatively affected urban SDGs. This suggests that the policy played an ecological conservation role but negatively impacted urban sustainable development, which primarily focused on socioeconomic well-being. Furthermore, the policy had a significant positive effect on the coupling coordination degree between ESSs and USDGs, as the coefficients in column (3) are 0.005 of basic DID and 0.004 of SAR-DID, and also enhanced the level of interaction between the two as the coefficients in column (4) are 0.013 and 0.007.  4.3 The transmission mechanism of the NKEFAs policy effect  Table 3  and  Table 4  show the results of the mediator, industrial agglomeration (Ind ) and technological innovation (Tec ), respectively, to test the transmission mechanism of the policy in Hypothesis 3. 4.3.1 Mediating effect of industrial agglomeration As shown in Table 3 , Ind  positively plays a mediating role in the effect of policy. The coefficients in column (1) report the benchmarking results, the same as the result of basic DID in Table 2 , placed here for ease of comparison. Results in column (2) show the impact of the policy on Ind , with a coefficient of 0.118, indicating a significant policy effect on the level of regional industrial agglomeration. Results in column (3) present the impact of policy on D with Ind ; the policy (did ) coefficient is 0.005, and the coefficient of Ind  is 0.003. These results acknowledge that the NKEFAs policy strongly influenced the level of local industrial agglomeration. By restricting large-scale, high-intensity urbanization and industrial development in the counties possessing NKEFAs, the policy strengthened the enterprises, labor, and other capital flow towards other counties within a city that are encouraged for development and optimization, driving a high degree of agglomeration in secondary and tertiary industries, creating economies of scale in areas not designed as NKEFAs. The pursuit of economic development in pilot cities may also incentivize decision-makers to put more effort into intensifying the introduction and development of industries in counties outside NKEFA zones, as illustrated in  Fig. 4 (b).  4.3.2 Mediating effect of technological innovation As shown in Table 4 , a coefficient of −0.278 of Tec  in column (2) means the NKEFAs policy adversely affected regional technological innovation. The results in column (3) are outcomes of technological innovation as a mediator; the coefficient of did  is 0.006, and the regression coefficient of Tec  is 0.002. These results clarify that while technological innovation can promote the coupling coordination degree, the NKEFAs policy had a negative effect on regional technological innovation for various reasons, leading to the detrimental pathway of policy effect (shown in Fig. 4 c). In light of this result, two contrary responses of technological innovation to the NKEFAs are proposed from the lens of fiscal support, as shown in Fig. 4 (a). The first is the "Fiscal Revenue Growth Effect," which stems from the enhancement of local government fiscal capabilities due to the EFT payments. If the government's expenditure ratio across all sectors remains constant, this effect would expand financial support for technological innovation, stimulating local technological and innovation activities. The second one is the "Crowding-Out Effect," which refers to a crowding-out effect on technological innovation expenditure caused by the inflation of fiscal spending in eco-environment protection and restoration, consequently weakening local technological innovation capabilities. Combining the results in Table 4 , the fiscal revenue growth effect did not offset the weakening impact of the crowding-out effect, resulting in an overall detrimental pathway of technological innovation.   4.4 Parallel trend testing As shown in  Fig. 5 , the estimated coefficients for each year before the establishment of the NKEFAs are generally not significant and fluctuate around 0. This indicates no significant difference in the coupling coordination degree between the treatment group and the control group before the establishment of the NKEFAs. For the year of implementation and subsequent years, the coefficients have passed the 1 % significance test, indicating that the parallel trend assumption of the DID estimation has been met. From a dynamic perspective, the coefficients for the years changed from non-significant before the establishment of NKEFAs to positive with significance after its establishment. This suggests that the NKEFAs policy has a significant positive effect and shows a dynamic upward trend.  4.5 Robustness test 4.5.1 Propensity score matching Considering that establishing the NKEFAs is not a random outcome but involves the selection of crucial ecological function areas by decision-maker, there is a risk of sample selection bias leading to endogeneity issues. The Propensity Score Matching (PSM) model can address this problem under conditions of non-random experimentation. Therefore, this study further employed PSM-DID to evaluate the policy effect of NKEFAs on SDGs-ESs nexus.  Fig. 6 (a) shows the kernel density of predicted scores for the treatment and the control groups before and after PSM. The probability distribution of scores in the treatment group after matching is closer to that of the control group before matching.  Table 5  reports the estimation results under the robustness strategy of PSM-DID. The magnitude and direction of the regression coefficients in its estimation results are generally consistent with the baseline regression model in Table 2 . This further confirms the positive promoting effect of NKEFAs on the degree of coupling coordination between ESs and SDGs.  4.5.2 Placebo test Fig. 6 (b) shows the placebo test kernel density distribution curve. As seen in the figure, the estimated coefficients from random sampling are mainly concentrated around 0, while the baseline regression result of 0.005 is positioned in the right of the lower tail of the coefficient distribution (0.001), making it a significant outlier in the placebo test. The results of this test indicate that the research was not affected by omitted variables or random factors in the model specification, and the baseline estimate results are robust and reliable.    5 Discussions 5.1 The spatio-temporal evolution of coupling coordination degree between USDGs and ESSs The CCDM was conducted to identify the interconnection of SDGs-ESs nexus; the results showed spatiotemporal evolution characteristics worth reflection and dialogue. First of all, the coupling coordination degree between USDGs and ESSs generally showed an upward trend over time, indicating that cities' social, economic, and ecological conditions are constantly changing. Therefore, local decision-makers are encouraged to disclose relevant status annually by conducting credible data collection. This requires developing and maturing the SDGs indicators framework suitable for localization, which faces the challenges of lacking good data and clear metrics, making it difficult to provide adequate support and guidance for local government supervision (Schmidt-Traub and Kroll, 2017 ). Spatially, the coupling coordination degree among cities exhibited distinct initial development conditions and natural endowments, indicating regional heterogeneity. This suggests that local policymakers should tailor their strategy to the uniqueness of economic structure and natural resource endowment while adapting to the broader national policy context. As an illustration, by leveraging nature-based recreation to promote the ecotourism industry, a region with abundant natural resources, especially in pilot areas, can enhance its economic prosperity. This, in turn, helps to reconcile environmental protection and socio-economic development. Despite the superior ecological conditions, pilot cities often lag in economic development, facing acute conflicts between economic growth and ecological conservation (Busch and Ring, 2021 ). It heightened attention to context-specificities of whether socio-economic conditions in pilot areas are capable of bearing ecological responsibilities as co-determinants of the criteria of EFT payments that policymaker considers. Therefore, from the perspective of environmental justice, respecting the conservation competencies of local government in terms of the status of social-economic development demand, establishing scientifically fair compensation standards, and ensuring environmental justice are key to the successful implementation of policies. This experience makes sense to any EFT in countries.  5.2 Uneven in the distribution of policy benefits The NKEFAs policy is a promising instrument for distributing around 0.95 % of the general transfer from the central government to pilot areas to provide incentives for nature conservation (Busch and Ring, 2021 ). The baseline regression results revealed a positive impact of the NKEFAs policy on ESSs and an unfavorable influence on USDGs, suggesting that the policy's benefits have yet to materialize fully in all fields. Two primary factors contribute to this phenomenon. Firstly, to date, while bolstering local fiscal capacities, EFT under the policy does not entirely offset the negative impacts resulting from measures that weaken the stimulus for economic development in the NKEFAs (Selva and Pauli, 2019 ). Secondly, the delimitation of ecological protection zones has led to population concentration in high-density urban areas, inadvertently exerting pressure on per capita public service capacity—including construction land, road area, and green park space—thereby adversely affecting metrics embedded in USDGs. More importantly, results derived from baseline regression demonstrate a significant positive impact of the NKEFAs on the degree of coupling coordination between USDGs and ESSs, suggesting that the benefits of establishing the NKEFAs are underway. Despite a potential initial decline in USDGs due to policy implementation, such a trend can be understood as part of the socio-ecological system's evolution. A threshold, or inflection point, is expected to be reached, at which the system will undergo a significant qualitative transformation, enabling full and effective synergy between urban sustainable development and ecosystem services. The analysis implied that the current state has yet to reach this critical juncture. The results suggested that there is room for optimization in implementing the policy. On the one hand, the key to solving this issue is the ability of fund transfers to cover conservation expenditures and opportunity costs. Therefore, it convinced the central government to assess the appropriate fiscal transfer payment dynamically and scientifically, ensuring that the funds can internalize the externalities of ecological protection. On the other hand, given that lower-level governments have autonomy in raising revenues and providing public goods and services (Droste and Ring, 2018 ), local governments have the discretion to allocate the funds received. Therefore, it is advisable to encourage local governments to make government expenditures transparent, facilitating public supervision and ensuring the rational distribution of revenues between environmental protection and social welfare, thus leading to balanced policy benefits in ESs and SDGs.  5.3 The pathways to coordinate urban SDGs and ESs Further analysis of the NKEFAs policy mechanism to identify critical pathways to support the implementation and optimization of the policy's effectiveness. The positive industrial agglomeration effect suggested that the NKEFAs policy had notably enhanced land use and resource allocation efficiency, as depicted in Fig. 4 (b). That disclosed the multi-cooperation to play to strengths of adjacent areas as a practical pathway to overcome regional deficiencies. Pilot areas can join forces with neighboring cities to take advantage of their developed economies, realizing regional coordination to alleviate local financial dependency and forming a cross-scale, long-term cooperation among participants. This can fundamentally internalize the ecological externalities of NKEFAs, promote regional complementarity, and achieve coordinated development. While Porter's Hypothesis typically posits that environmental regulations are conducive to technological innovation (Bai and Hu, 2023 ), the findings in this study revealed that unique policies like the NKEFAs, focusing more on land use regulation and EFT payments, yielded results that diverged from this hypothesis. Given that the regression coefficients for the technological innovation variable indicate its effectiveness in promoting the nexus of ESs and SDGs, it highlights the importance of strengthening green technology innovation to overcome the adverse effect pathway. Increasing fiscal support for technological innovation in the future could be a viable approach to bolster environmental conservation and regional socio-economic development, particularly as the marginal benefits of conservation work decline due to constraints on land area and population growth.  5.4 limitation The 17 SDGs were designed to reconcile environmental protection with socio-economic development (Zeng and Maxwell, 2020 ). Challenges emerged in formulating appropriate targets and indicators while quantifying (Hák and Janoušková, 2016 ). In the process of localizing SDGs to Chinese cities, limitations due to data gaps were produced in this study, with some SDGs not included. The raw data in our study came from the official Statistical Bureau (Supplementary S3 . Sources and Descriptive Statistics of Key Variables), which can be continuously updated and is reliable. Yet the official databases lack some indicators, such as the target "16.2 End abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of children" in SDG16, thus imposing some limitations on this article.   6 Conclusions This study contributed to identifying the deviations in direction and details within the progress towards SDGs from the perspective of ecological protection, clarifying the inherent complexity of the SDGs-ESs nexus, understanding the various outcomes and responses to policies in specific contexts, and eventually becoming supportive of tackling global challenges. A synthesized framework that incorporated the coupling coordination degree between the USDGs and ESSs provided and the difference-in-differences model was introduced to empirically verify the policy's effect and mechanisms, offering a comprehensive perception of the SDGs-ESs nexus. The study showed an upward trend in the degree of coupling coordination between USDGs and ESSs. Significant regional variations have also been found, underscoring the importance of considering local context-specificities when making strategic policies to uphold environmental justice. Secondly, the empirical investigation into the effects of the NKEFAs policy across 188 Chinese cities from 2006 to 2019 suggested that the approach facilitates a more harmonious balance between SDGs and ESs. Furthermore, the study identified industrial agglomeration and technological innovation pathways, which, as critical factors in shaping these outcomes, provide valuable insights for targeted policy adjustments at the regional level. Tackling the progress details and providing insight into the direction of action can help correct negative bias under the high-scoring smokescreen in progress toward SDGs and inform the transformations. Regarding this, the vital role of ESs should be emphasized, but environmental justice must also be ensured simultaneously. The achievement of SDGs at the local level constitutes its realization at the country level, and forms the basis of global SDGs progress. Therefore, from a scale perspective, prefectural cities are the administrative units that directly relate to people's well-being, and policy implementation and have standardized data collection, making this study relatively scarce. This study hopes to represent a point for stimulating some discussion on international theoretical frameworks and the localization of SDGs. In the future, efforts can be put into improving the indicator system, as well as expanding the research scale to the city level. The different coordination pathways between SDGs and ESs under varying conditions and backgrounds are also worth investigating and can potentially contribute to more profound and practical policy recommendations.
