                  The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) offer a universal framework for addressing pressing global economic, environmental, and social challenges. Central to the SDG agenda is the vital role of business innovation in fostering positive change and promoting the triple bottom line of sustainability: people, planet, and prosperity. Many years have passed following the SDGs’ inception, yet the engagement of business innovation scholarship with the SDGs remains sparse. Moreover, a comprehensive review examining the convergence of business, innovation, and sustainability through the lens of the SDGs is notably absent, constraining insights into present advancements and prospective trajectories. In this regard, this study adopts the SDGs as a lens to investigate the contribution of business innovation to sustainable development challenges and its impact on the SDG agenda. To do so, this study conducts a systematic literature review, incorporating a bibliometric analysis of articles published in top-tier business journals, to offer an integrated overview of current trends in business, innovation, and sustainability research through the lens of the SDGs. In addition, this study performs a content analysis to consolidate and synthesize relevant research in this space, resulting in a multi-dimensional framework that illustrates the intricate, dynamic interplay between the drivers, dimensions, and impacts of business innovation on sustainability and their relationship with the SDGs. In doing so, this study accentuates extant gaps, delineates profound implications, and proposes meaningful directions to advance the understanding of the intersection between business, innovation, and sustainability in the context of the SDGs.

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) offer a universal framework for addressing pressing global economic, environmental, and social challenges. Central to the SDG agenda is the vital role of business innovation in fostering positive change and promoting the triple bottom line of sustainability: people, planet, and prosperity. Many years have passed following the SDGs’ inception, yet the engagement of business innovation scholarship with the SDGs remains sparse. Moreover, a comprehensive review examining the convergence of business, innovation, and sustainability through the lens of the SDGs is notably absent, constraining insights into present advancements and prospective trajectories. In this regard, this study adopts the SDGs as a lens to investigate the contribution of business innovation to sustainable development challenges and its impact on the SDG agenda. To do so, this study conducts a systematic literature review, incorporating a bibliometric analysis of articles published in top-tier business journals, to offer an integrated overview of current trends in business, innovation, and sustainability research through the lens of the SDGs. In addition, this study performs a content analysis to consolidate and synthesize relevant research in this space, resulting in a multi-dimensional framework that illustrates the intricate, dynamic interplay between the drivers, dimensions, and impacts of business innovation on sustainability and their relationship with the SDGs. In doing so, this study accentuates extant gaps, delineates profound implications, and proposes meaningful directions to advance the understanding of the intersection between business, innovation, and sustainability in the context of the SDGs.   Keywords Business  Innovation  Sustainability  Sustainable development  SDGs    1 Introduction “We need business leaders to use their enormous influence to push for inclusive growth and opportunities. No one business can afford to ignore this effort, and there is no global goal that cannot benefit from private sector investment ”—António Guterres, UN Secretary General. In recent years, global businesses have faced numerous crises, including ecological disasters, widening inequalities, political and racial unrests, and most recently, COVID-19 (Lim, 2022a, 2022b, 2023c ). The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are increasingly considered a framework for businesses to address these challenges by transforming them into viable solutions (Castillo, 2022 ; Kumar, Paltrinieri et al., 2022; Lim, Kumar et al., 2023; Smith et al., 2022 ). As emphasized by the UN Secretary General, businesses play a critical role in achieving these goals and face mounting pressure to contribute. Addressing the sustainability agenda is not only a moral imperative but also vital for businesses’ continued growth and reputation as responsible stakeholders, as demanded by various stakeholders (Bhattacharyya et al., 2022; Lim, 2023a; Lim, Ciasullo et al., 2023; Mahajan et al., 2023 ). Consequently, businesses are employing innovation as a key driver to develop transformative solutions for sustainable development challenges (Bamel et al., 2023; Kraus et al., 2023; Singh et al., 2023 ). Enhanced innovation capacity is essential for creating, maintaining, and expanding value, growth, and competitive advantage at global, national, and organizational levels (Crossan and Apaydin, 2010; Lee and Park, 2006; Raymond and St-Pierre, 2010; Rowley and Sambrook, 2009 ). Our review connects two relevant business topics—i.e., innovation and sustainability—using the SDGs as a lens to review the current state of research at the intersection of business, innovation, and sustainability. This review is crucial to identify existing gaps and propose future impactful research that advances the field. The significance of innovation in addressing sustainable development challenges is evident through growing academic engagement in this area (e.g., Cordova and Celone, 2019; Park et al. 2021 ). Despite the crucial role of innovation in achieving the SDGs and sustaining business growth, current understanding of the connection between innovation and SDGs in business remains fragmented and underdeveloped. There is a lack of comprehensive empirical-driven insights and state-of-the-art overviews needed to advance this vital field. Numerous studies have emerged in recent years examining innovation (e.g., Hafter and Costa, 2023 ) and the SDGs (e.g., De Ruyter et al., 2022; Voola et al., 2022 ), but few focus on the link between the two (e.g., Nylund et al., 2021; Sinha et al., 2020b ). These studies offer valuable perspectives on how businesses use innovation to address sustainable development challenges; however, they typically adopt a narrow view on how specific innovations contribute to the SDGs. Noteworthily, the context of these innovations—i.e., developed versus developing countries, the industry/sector in which these innovations are taking place, how the innovation addresses SDGs, the role of technology in these innovations, and the research methods used in the studies—remains underexplored. Such insights are crucial for analyzing the business-innovation-sustainability interface, locating extant gaps, and identifying promising opportunities for future research. Progress towards the SDG targets, already lagging before the pandemic, has suffered significantly due to COVID-19 (Lim, 2022a; Zhao et al, 2022 ). The confluence of crises, including COVID-19, climate change, and geopolitical conflicts, has halted or reversed progress towards achieving Agenda 2030. The Sustainable Development Report (Sachs et al, 2022 ) confirms that, in 2022, the world experienced the second consecutive year without progress on the SDGs. As countries rebuild amid uncertainties surrounding new COVID-19 variants, rising inflation, major supply chain disruptions, and unsustainable debt in developing nations, a renewed focus on SDGs becomes critical (Sachs et al, 2022 ). Businesses, as key drivers of socioeconomic growth, must play a crucial role in restoring the SDGs on an upward trajectory and propel their continued progress with greater agility and impact (Lim, 2022a ). Given the scarcity of business research on innovation and sustainability driving the SDGs, a comprehensive overview of innovation’s role in advancing sustainability, and by extension, the SDG agenda, is necessary. This overview will help galvanize informed efforts to address the gaps and opportunities for sustaining business growth. As many years have passed since the launch of the SDGs in 2015, it is an appropriate time to examine business research at the intersection of innovation and sustainability through the lens of the SDGs. We respond to this research gap by exploring the following research questions (RQs):RQ1.  What is the state of business research on innovation and the SDGs? RQ2.  What are the gaps in business research on innovation and the SDGs? RQ3.  What are the opportunities for business research to drive innovation to achieve the SDGs?   We answer these questions through a systematic literature review using a bibliometric-content analysis of business research on innovation and the SDGs published in premier journals. This review encompasses 111 papers published in journals ranked “A*” and “A” by the Australian Business Deans Council (ABDC) Journal Quality List (JQL) between 2015 and 2021. The convention of systematic literature reviews focusing on premier business journals has been encouraged and practiced by various scholars (e.g., Kumar, Sahoo et al., 2022; Lim et al., 2021; Paul et al., 2021; Sahoo et al., 2022 ), ensuring that the resulting insights are grounded in novel and rigorous research that has withstood the highest level of peer scrutiny (Lim, 2021 ). Our study makes three key contributions to the literature. First , we merge two essential topics in business—i.e., innovation and sustainability—through the lens of the SDGs. We contribute to the innovation and sustainability literature by being the first to undertake a systematic literature review of business research on innovation and the SDGs, advancing and facilitating discussion on what is known in this field by means of a synthesis (Kraus et al., 2022; Lim et al., 2022 ). Through a bibliometric analysis (Donthu et al., 2021; Mukherjee et al., 2022 ), we locate emerging trends in business research on innovation and the SDGs from the performance and intellectual structure standpoint. We draw on content analysis (Kraus et al., 2022 ) to deep dive into the setting of these innovations from multiple perspectives such as developed versus developing countries, the industry/sector in which these innovations are taking place, how the innovation links to specific SDGs and which SDGs are addressed, the role of technology in these innovations, and the research methods (e.g., quantitative, qualitative, or conceptual/review) used in the studies. Second , we contribute to the literature by developing a conceptual framework, supported by a wealth of empirical evidence, that illustrates the interconnections between the drivers, dimensions, and impacts of innovation on sustainability through the lens of the SDGs. This framework serves as an integrative and unifying platform (Lim et al., 2022; Paul et al., 2021 ), adding value to the current debate by offering a perspective not yet covered in existing literature, thereby expanding research in this field. Third and finally , consolidating these insights, our research identifies knowledge gaps and recommends areas for further investigation, allowing scholars to position their intended contributions to the field (Donthu et al., 2021; Mukherjee et al., 2022 ). Our research thus lays the groundwork for advancing knowledge in this critical field in novel and meaningful ways (Kraus et al., 2022; Lim et al., 2022 ). The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. We begin with a brief overview of the theoretical background for innovation, followed by a short discussion on SDGs and innovation. We then present the methodology and findings of our review. Subsequently, we discuss our findings and present a framework that synthesizes knowledge on the intersection of business, innovation, and sustainability through the lens of the SDGs, identifying gaps, and suggesting areas for future research. We conclude by discussing our theoretical contributions and managerial implications.  2 Theoretical background Innovation, despite being extensively researched, lacks a standardized definition, with numerous frameworks, models, and typologies available (Lee and Park, 2006; Raymond and Pierre, 2010 ). Common themes in defining innovation encompass newness and novelty in approaching tasks (Crossan and Apaydin, 2010; Van de Ven et al., 1986 ), the significance of knowledge (Plessis, 2007 ), the enabling role of technology (Nord and Tucker, 1987 ), and the association of newness with change (Damanpour, 1996 ). To align with the overarching purpose and scope of our research, we adopt Damanpour’s (1996, p. 694)  definition of innovation, which encapsulates critical aspects such as organizational changes in response to internal and external environmental pressures, a focus on newness, and various innovation types:“Innovation is conceived as a means of changing an organization, either as a response to changes in the external environment or as a pre-emptive action to influence the environment [and thus can be] broadly defined to encompass a range of types, including new product or service, new process technology, new organization structure or administrative systems, or new plans or program pertaining to organization members.”   Innovation is often categorized into product and process innovation, with the former pertaining to the invention or the opening of a new market and the latter involving improvements in processes or production efficiencies (Lee and Park, 2006; Raymond and Pierre, 2010 ). Technology plays a vital role in both types, with product innovation featuring significantly different technological characteristics or intended uses compared to prior products, resulting in enhanced performance (Raymond and Pierre, 2010 ). Process innovation, conversely, refers to the adoption of technologically new or significantly improved production methods. While product innovation consists of radical changes that enable organizations to maintain their market position through breakthroughs or revolutionary shifts, process innovation is more incremental, allowing organizations to improve their competitiveness by reducing production costs and increasing productivity flexibility (Lee and Park, 2006; Raymond and Pierre, 2010 ). The SDGs, introduced by the UN in 2015, provide a comprehensive framework to address economic, environmental, and social challenges in pursuit of a more equitable and sustainable world for future generations (Lim, 2022a ). Despite being broad and ambitious, the SDGs face inherent contradictions, particularly between environmental sustainability and socio-economic development (Voola et al., 2022 ). Nevertheless, the SDGs have become a universal language and framework, unifying stakeholders to collaboratively address these challenges. Due to the complex nature of sustainability challenges, innovation is considered crucial for transformative and sustainable solutions that do not necessarily demand massive financial resources. Innovative thinking and mindsets are required to leverage technology use and implement small, frugal changes with significant impact for sustainable development. However, integrating sustainability into innovation processes and assessing an innovation’s sustainability impact is challenging and complex due to conflicting interests and parameters that differ across industries, countries, and time (von Geibler et al., 2019 ). Therefore, this paper endeavors to contribute new knowledge on the convergence of business, innovation, and sustainability through the SDGs lens, identifying gaps and opportunities for future research.  3 Methodology This study conducts a systematic literature review using a bibliometric-content analysis. The review is guided by a four-stage process involving searching, screening, selection, and evaluation of relevant research in line with Moher et al.’s (2009) PRISMA protocol (Fig. 1  ). Through this systematic process, our review decisions are transparently disclosed, thereby enabling it to be replicable (Palmatier et al., 2018 ; Paul et al., 2021; Tranfield, 2003 ). The last stage of this process deals with the analysis of research that gets retained in the review. The convention of using a bibliometric-content analysis has been encouraged and practiced by past scholars (e.g., Bartolini et al., 2019; Ciasullo et al., 2022 ; Kumar, Lim et al., 2022 ), enabling the review to provide both breadth (e.g., performance and intellectual structure; Donthu et al., 2021; Mukherjee et al., 2022 ) and depth (e.g., key characteristics or peculiarities of specific content areas; Kraus et al., 2022; Lim et al., 2022 ) in insights. The next sections disclose the decisions taken in the review. 3.1 Searching The first stage involves searching for  articles. We use two databases for the search: Scopus and Business Source Complete, which complement each other (Pizzi et al., 2020 ). Scopus indexes a vast collection of business journals that meet stringent quality criteria (Paul et al., 2021 ), whereas Business Source Complete serves a similar function but with a broader scope (Pizzi et al., 2020 ). By including Business Source Complete, we could incorporate articles and journals along with their scanned copies, which may not have been captured in Scopus due to recent digitization and indexing (Pizzi et al., 2020 ). The research team, who possess expertise in business, innovation, and sustainability, brainstormed the keywords for the search string—i.e., “SDG*” OR “sustainable development goal*” AND “innovat*”—based on an independent reading of recent studies in the field (e.g., Caiado et al., 2017; García-Feijoo et al., 2020 ). This approach is consistent with past reviews (Goodell et al., 2021; Rao et al., 2023 ) and the recommendation of review guides to rely on the expertise, experience, and exposure of the research team (Kraus et al., 2022 ). Using this search string, a total of 1,734 and 267 articles were retrieved from Scopus and Business Source Complete, respectively. Additional filters in the databases were applied to gain a more precise curation of relevant articles. As the SDGs were established in 2015, the period of the search at the time of study was set at 2015 to 2021. Only articles published in the English language and the subject area of “business, management and accounting” were considered, wherein the former is attributed to lingua franca  and the latter is due to the discipline focused on this review (i.e., business). This practice is in line with review guides (e.g., Kraus et al., 2022; Paul et al., 2021 ). Using these filters, a total of 189 and 206 articles were retained, whereas 1,545 and 61 articles were excluded from Scopus and Business Source Complete, respectively.  3.2 Screening The second stage involves screening  of articles. Sample selection is an important component of systematic literature reviews (Hiebl, 2021; Tham et al., 2022 ). The list of quality journals is a method to perform high-quality screening of articles in systematic literature reviews (Paul et al., 2021 ). In this study, the ABDC’s JQL is used, whereby only articles published in journals ranked “A*” or “A”, which represent the highest quality of business journals, are included. This practice is in line with past reviews (e.g., Kumar, Sahoo et al., 2022; Lim et al., 2021; Sahoo et al., 2022 ). Using this screening practice, a total of 113 articles were retained while 282 articles were excluded.  3.3 Selection The third stage involves selection  of articles based on their eligibility. Given that the focus of this study is on business, innovation, and sustainability, articles that do not fall within this focus are excluded. Using this selection method, which is governed by content relevance (Kraus et al., 2022 ), a total of 111 articles were retained while two articles were excluded (Appendix ).  3.4 Evaluation The fourth stage involves evaluation  of articles based on a bibliometric-content analysis. Specifically, we conduct a performance analysis using Excel software to examine the productivity, impact, and contributors, as well as a science mapping by means of keyword co-occurrences using the VOSviewer software (van Eck and Waltman, 2010 ) to explore the major themes in the field (Donthu et al., 2021; Mukherjee et al., 2022 ). In terms of content analysis, we consolidated the commonalities across the major themes into streams (i.e., theme/stream-based content analysis) and coded each article based on five criteria—i.e., developed versus developing countries, the industry/sector in which these innovations are taking place, how the innovation addresses SDGs, the role of technology in these innovations, and the research methods used in the studies—to gain an understanding of the settings that transpire in the field (i.e., context/method-based content analysis) (Guthrie et al, 2012; Pizzi et al., 2020; Kraus et al., 2022 ).   4 Findings 4.1 Performance analysis of trends in research publication, productivity, and impact 4.1.1 Publication trend Although the SDGs were introduced in 2015, the first article examining business, innovation, and sustainability through the lens of the SDGs was not published in an “A*” or “A” journal until 2017 (Fig. 2  ). This observation could be attributed to the SDGs’ late launch in 2015 (Lim, 2022a ), and the fact that research is a resource-intensive endeavor (Lim, 2023b ). Additionally, publishing in premier journals typically involves multiple rounds of rigorous peer review, adhering to high standards (Lim, 2021 ). Despite these challenges, research productivity in this area has grown exponentially over the years, indicating a vast potential for publishing novel findings in top-tier outlets within the field.  4.1.2 Most productive and impactful contributors The most prolific contributors to business research on innovation and sustainability through the lens of the SDGs in premier business journals are presented in Table 1   based on productivity and Table 2   based on impact. Three major contributors are examined: journals, authors, and countries. In terms of the most prolific journals, Journal of Cleaner Production  is the most productive (45 articles) and impactful (737 citations) journal, followed by Technological Forecasting and Social Change  (nine articles) and Research Policy  (314 citations), respectively. Together with other productive and impactful journals, these journals highlight that innovation can manifest across a spectrum of business activities (e.g., accounting, business strategy, production, and operations management) involving both policy and technology. In terms of the most prolific authors, A. Sinha is the most productive (four articles) and impactful (121 citations) author. Only nine other authors have two articles while four other authors have been cited at least 40 times. These observations suggest that research in this field remains nascent, as fields that are well established tend to have a greater number of authors with more articles and citations (e.g., customer engagement; Lim, Rasul et al., 2022 ). In terms of the most prolific countries, the United Kingdom is the most productive (22 articles) and impactful (694 citations) country. The other most productive countries are the United States (15 articles), China (14 articles), Italy (14 articles), Australia (11 articles), India (11 articles), and the Netherlands (seven articles), whereas the other most impactful countries include Italy (289 citations), India (217 citations), China (192 citations), and the United States (183 citations). These observations imply that greater productivity does not necessarily translate into greater impact. Indeed, the countries that are lagging behind in leading innovation productivity do not necessarily play down the importance of innovation. In fact, it is the contrary, as seen through the citation impact that their innovation delivers to others. Other noteworthy observations include a good diversity of Eastern and Western countries, reaffirming that innovation and sustainability are both important and impactful in global business.  4.1.3 Most impactful articles The most impactful articles as measured by citations received are presented in Table 3  . The most impactful article is Schot and Steinmueller (2018)  with 314 citations, which established three frames for transformative innovation policy: research and development, national systems of innovation, and contemporary social and environmental challenges such as the SDGs. The second most impactful article is Bebbington and Unerman (2018)  with 222 citations, which highlighted the enabling of role of accounting in the pursuit of the SDGs as well as that of the SDGs as a lens for (re)invigorating accounting’s contribution to sustainable development debates. The perspective of SDGs as a contextual lens by Bebbington and Unerman (2018)  also reaffirms the adoption and implementation of the same in the present study. The other most impactful articles that make up the top five list are Sullivan et al. (2018) , which established the relevance of integrating industrial ecology into business strategy to contribute to the SDGs, and Sinha et al. (2020a) , which examined the interplay between technological innovation and environmental quality to formulate SDG policies for 11 economies. Finally, Barbier and Burgess (2020)  identified and championed three innovative policies that can yield immediate progress towards the SDGs in a cost-effective manner, namely a fossil fuel subsidy swap to fund clean energy investments, a reallocation of irrigation subsidies to improve natural resource conditions and infrastructure, and a tropical carbon tax as a levy on fossil fuels that funds natural climate solutions. Taken collectively, the contributions exemplified by the most impactful articles suggest that both internal (e.g., accounting practices) and external (e.g., innovation policies) forces can shape business innovation activities in contributing to the SDGs, and by extension, greater sustainability.   4.2 Science mapping of major themes The major themes of business research on innovation and sustainability through the lens of the SDGs (107 articles) are explored using science mapping by means of a co-occurrence analysis for keywords that have a minimum of two occurrences in line with past reviews (e.g., Goodell et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2021 ). The underpinning assumption of co-occurrence analysis, which is a form of bibliometric analysis for science mapping, is that the keywords that authors list reflect the topical essence of their articles. In addition, the keywords that frequently appear together signify a common theme, as denoted through colored clusters in the visualization of keyword co-occurrences (Donthu et al., 2021; Mukherjee et al., 2022 ). The nomological network of keywords is illustrated in Fig. 3  , indicating that the major themes in the field revolve around sustainable business models  (purple cluster), sustainable consumption and production  (e.g., cleaner production, responsible consumption) (orange cluster), sustainability in developing countries  (red cluster), knowledge management  (dark pink cluster), sustainability management  (light pink cluster), research and development  (brown cluster), carbon management  (e.g., carbon emissions) (yellow cluster), corporate responsibility and sustainability reporting  (e.g., corporate social responsibility, shared value) (dark green cluster), digitalization  (light green cluster), contextual differences  (e.g., country, demographic, industry) (dark blue cluster), and energy management  (e.g., energy efficiency, renewable energy) (light blue cluster). As seen in Fig. 3 , the major themes revealed by the co-occurrence analysis of keywords are broad with little depth at this juncture. This may be explained by the field being in an infancy stage. We therefore carried out a content analysis by means of thematic analysis by reverse-tracing the keywords to their articles to consolidate these major themes into three meaningful, parsimonious streams. In this process, we did not discard any themes; instead, we organized the commonalities across themes into three primary streams to enhance their coherence and significance. The first stream of research comprises articles that showcase the different typologies and manifestations of innovation in business for sustainable development  (e.g., different types (products/processes) and forms of innovation (e.g., green, frugal, and inclusive) relating to sustainable development). Product innovations include agricultural innovations and tools (Nong et al., 2020 ), environmental aspects such as energy and solar (Bisaga et al., 2021; Dangelico, 2017; Lubango, 2020; Temiz and Dincer, 2021 ), food, fuel, and water production systems (Ogbeibu et al., 2020; Temiz and Dincer, 2021 ), plant clinics (Tambo et al., 2020 ), sharing economy apps (Lucas et al., 2021 ), and sustainable clothing (Provin et al., 2021 ), among others, whereas service innovations focus on climate smart innovations and practices (D’Amato et al., 2021; Partey et al., 2018; Teklewold, et al., 2019 ), including financial tools and services (Gunarathne and Sankalpani, 2021 ; Macqueenet et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021 ). Often, these innovations are enabled by technologies involving mobile devices, online platforms, solar technology, as well as new-age technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and the internet of things (De Villiers, 2021; Pizzi et al., 2020; Quayson et al., 2021; Tang and Christopher, 2020 ). Noteworthily, among the different forms of innovation, the majority were green innovations that address environmental challenges while also linked to socio-economic impacts and thus reinforcing the overlap between the three-bottom lines of economic, environmental, and social aspects of sustainable development. For example, Alvarado et al. (2021)  highlighted the growing demand for food, which has a direct pressure on air and soil quality and thus reinforcing the link between economic, environmental, and social aspects of sustainability. The authors argued that realization of various environment related SDGs (e.g., SDGs 6, 7, 11, 12, 14, and 15) depends principally on the capacity to create environment-friendly novel processes and commercial products and services given the interconnectedness of the SDGs. Green innovations focused on biodiversity, consumption of raw materials, and preservation of ecological systems such as land and sea also had socio-economic benefits. In addition to green solutions, the articles also shed light on low-cost frugal innovations to solve societal problems of low-income groups in emerging economies (Fischer et al., 2021 ), such as micro franchise network for the base or bottom of the pyramid (BoP) population (Patnaik and Bhowmick, 2020 ) and innovative technology enabled operations to empower women to alleviate poverty, improve health, increased access to clean water and sanitation, as well as education (Patnaik and Bhowmick, 2020 ). The second stream of research contains articles that focus on the linkages between innovations in business and sustainable development . The concept of sustainable development is often used as a generic term to highlight both environmental and societal issues. Due to the broad nature of sustainable development, there are a broad range of concepts and issues that the articles engaged with. The most prominent issues include poverty (Du et al., 2021; Tambo et al., 2020 ) and climate change (Balsalobre-Lorente et al., 2021; Crecente et al., 2021; Ogbeibu, et al., 2021 ). Other issues that were studied include conflict (Yarnall et al., 2021 ), food systems (Kump and Fikar, 2021 ) and water conservation (Garrick et al., 2020 ; de Sousa Jabbour et al., 2020 ). Inequalities such as inherited caste identity in India (Mosse, 2018 ), financial inclusion and gender in Nigeria (Adegbite and Machethe, 2020 ), and social health inequalities (Poirier et al., 2020 ) were also revealed. There was also a focus on the context within which business innovation for sustainable development was occurring, particularly in emerging countries (Bisaga et al., 2018; Du et al., 2021; Kalkanci et al., 2019 ) versus developed markets (Balsalobre-Lorente et al., 2021 ). It is also interesting to note that some of the authors who focused on emerging countries applied the BoP thesis as a theoretical framework (e.g., Molina-Maturano et al., 2020 ), whereas other authors studied specific context such as the impact of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) on sustainable development (de Sousa Jabbour et al., 2020 ), the influence of entrepreneurial ecosystems on sustainable development (Volkmann et al., 2021 ), and the role of communication for sustainable development (Fischer, et al., 2021 ). The importance of technologies in catalyzing sustainable development has also received attention by researchers (e.g., Uniyal et al., 2021 ). The third stream of research consists of articles that explore the explicit contributions of innovation in business to the different SDGs . While innovation itself contributes to the realization of SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), research in this stream has also addressed issues related to other SDGs. SDGs that received frequent attention include SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), appearing in 21 articles (19%); SDG 13 (climate action) and SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), each appearing in 20 articles (18%); and SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) and SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), each appearing in 14 articles (12%). The predominance of these SDGs further confirms that business research on innovation and sustainability through the lens of the SDGs is largely directed towards promoting environmental sustainability. While SDG 13 (climate action) and SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) are directly attributed to environmental sustainability, SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) is increasingly being recognized as a critical building block for achieving environmental sustainability. This stream on SDGs, therefore, not only represents the interconnections between the three spheres of sustainability but also between different SDGs. However, except for a few articles (e.g., Bisaga et al., 2020 ), the trade-offs and synergies of interconnected SDGs were rarely explored, signaling a promising area for future research. To complement our theme/stream-based content analysis, we conducted a context/method-based content analysis. For the context/method-based content analysis, we followed the approach used by Pizzi et al. (2020) , which encompasses various aspects relating to context and method, including economic development mapping, industrial/sectorial mapping, SDG mapping, technovation mapping, and methodological mapping (Table 4  ). In the subsequent subsections, we examine the state of research in the field based on the categorization of the 111 articles according to the context/method-based content analysis (Table 5)  . 4.2.1 Economic development mapping Of all the articles reviewed in business research, 57.66% (n: 64) focused on the interface between innovation and SDGs with reference to specific geographic contexts while the rest were conceptual/review articles, often with a regional or a global focus. While 14.06% (n: 9) of these articles have discussed this interface broadly in the global context, it is interesting to note that most of the research (64.05%, n: 41) have investigated this issue in developing economies. Among the 41 articles that focused on developing countries, 51.2% (n: 21) covered the innovation-SDGs interface in Asian countries, followed by 31.7% (n: 13) in African countries, and 17.03% (n: 7) in South American countries. Developing countries that are highly represented in this review include India (12.5%, n: 8), followed by China (9.38%, n: 6), Brazil (4.69%, n: 3), Rwanda (3,13%, n: 2), and Morocco (3,13%, n: 2). Within the developed world, while Europe is highly represented, there is a relative scarcity of knowledge from North America – with only two articles identified in this review. As contextual differences present different emphasis on various SDGs, a broader geographical research coverage is critical for understanding business strategies and implementation challenges for realizing SDGs across different contexts of economic development.  4.2.2 Industrial / sectorial mapping Over half of the articles reviewed in business research (n: 57) have focused on the interface between innovation and SDGs in various industries/sectors. About one-quarter of these articles (n: 14) have focused on agriculture and food, followed by 12.28% (n: 7) in energy, and 8.77% (n: 5) each in healthcare and in tourism and hospitality. The predominance of research in these industries/sectors, where environmental sustainability is a major challenge, further reinforces that environmental sustainability is emerging as a dominant theme in business research on innovation and sustainability through the lens of the SDGs. The focus on the environmental aspect is further supported by the type of questions examined in the articles. For example, the articles in the agriculture industry have principally examined issues such as how to support the circular economy transition with customer involvement moderating the exploitation of innovative eco-design capabilities (Soh and Wong, 2021 ), how to develop a sustainable food supply chain network (Jouzdani and Govindan, 2021 ), what is the effect of R&D on environmental degradation as measured by ecological footprint and air quality, including the role of agriculture and trade (Alvarado et al., 2021 ), and how innovation can help reduce gender gap in smallholder agriculture (Adegbite and Machethe, 2020 ). The articles in the energy industry have focused on issues such as the impact of technological innovation on energy efficiency (Chen et al., 2021 ), the use of innovative solar off-grid systems as an alternative source of energy supply in Sub-Saharan Africa (Bisaga et al., 2021 ), and whether replacing fossil fuel with renewable energy influences total factor productivity (TFP) (Sohag et al., 2021 ). However, interestingly, other heavy polluting industries/sectors such as infrastructure, manufacturing, and steel have not received much attention and thus could be areas for future research.  4.2.3 SDG mapping As mentioned previously, in addition to the apparent linkage to SDG 9, business research on innovation and sustainability through the lens of the SDGs has also addressed issues related to the other SDGs due to their interconnectedness, either generally or in relation to specific SDGs in 212 occasions. Of them, 8.49% (n: 23) articles have studied innovation from the broader SDGs perspective (e.g., Malay and Aubinet, 2021; Volkmann et al., 2021 ). In terms of the specific SDGs standpoint, 9.90% (n: 21) articles have presented the linkage with SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), 9.43% (n: 20) each with SDG 13 (climate action) and SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), and 6.6% (n: 14) each with SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) and SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth).  4.2.4 Technovation mapping Among the articles reviewed in business research, about one-quarter (24.3%, n: 27) of them have focused on technology-driven innovation and its impact on the SDGs. The application of technology-driven innovation such as ICT-enabled service, development of mobile app, and off-grid solar is primarily directed towards the SDGs linked with environmental sustainability. For example, Srikanth (2018)  highlighted the need for low-carbon energy technologies with coal so that the reliability, security, and affordability of electric supply are balanced with sustainable development. Other studies have explored the potential contributions of new-age technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data in driving the SDG agenda (Castro et al., 2021 ), developed environmental solutions via the enterprise complexity model (ECM) to overcome complex environmental problems (Espejo, 2020 ), and assessed big data analytics as a key enabler in helping to address social challenges (El-Haddadeh et al., 2021 ), among others. Our review, however, identifies only limited business research (e.g., Lubango, 2020 ) focusing on the diffusion of clean technology and its links to the SDGs, which could be an important area of future research.  4.2.5 Methodological mapping The articles for business research on innovation and sustainability through the lens of the SDGs have adopted an array of research methods. While over one-third of the articles adopted a conceptual/review methodology, often focusing on theoretical or policy issues, slightly more than half of the articles were empirical, with the application of mixed methods a rare sight. About 38% (n: 42) employed conceptual or review methods for study, 34% (n: 38) utilized quantitative methods involving primary data collection and secondary sources, 21% (n: 23) used qualitative methods such as case studies and interviews, and 7% (n: 8) ventured with mixed methods. The use of diverse research methods could produce new and improved understanding for realizing the SDGs (Pizzi et al., 2020 ). While a large majority of articles are developed through conceptual/review methods, only 3.6% (n: 4) of the 111 articles are driven by policy issues. This is concerning as the achievement of the SDGs warrant partnership between various stakeholders. Therefore, collaborative research involving policymakers and practitioners can help to develop better understanding and strategies for achieving the SDGs via innovation from an array of business disciplines. Bebbington and Unerman (2018)  also highlight that SDG research should not be performed merely for academic gain, as this knowledge also plays a relevant role for policymakers. Moreover, while the preponderance of qualitative studies offers valuable insights about the contribution of innovation to the SDGs, a more generalized understanding in this space, including at the aggregate level, is also highly encouraged.    5 Discussion and conclusion Innovation is increasingly being recognized as a vital enabler for developing sustainable solutions to address the rising challenges of sustainable development. Despite this growing focus, our review demonstrates that the business discourse on innovation and sustainability from the lens of the SDGs remains in its infancy, though experiencing significant growth since 2017. This finding suggests ample scope for future research to advance this field. In the following sections, we discuss our theoretical contributions, managerial implications, and directions for future research. 5.1 Theoretical contributions Our paper makes three key contributions that facilitate theory development and, consequently, knowledge advancement at the intersection of business, innovation, and sustainability through the lens of the SDGs. First , we provide insights into how business innovation scholarship has engaged with the SDGs (RQ1) by conducting a bibliometric-content analysis guided under a rigorous and transparent systematic literature review methodology. By combining these methods, our review offers a higher standard of academic rigor, shedding light on the emerging trends and unpacking the evolutionary nuances of the business-innovation-sustainability discourse to advance the field in the era of the SDGs. Our key findings highlight that (i) the impact of innovation spans across economic, environmental, and social dimensions, reinforcing the overlaps between these dimensions of sustainability; (ii) innovations are linked with climate and environmental aspects (e.g., green buildings, green technologies, living labs, plant clinics), with the underlying premise that environment-friendly novel processes and commercial products will have positive socio-economic impacts; (iii) technology is a key driver of innovation in the digital, hyperconnected era (e.g., artificial intelligence, big data analytics, blockchain), and (iv) most business research on innovation and sustainability through the lens of the SDGs is being conducted in developing economies. Second , we develop a multi-dimensional framework that can be used to comprehend and guide business pursuit of innovation to contribute to sustainability through the lens of the SDGs (Fig. 4  ). By consolidating the existing body of knowledge on the SDG interface involving business, innovation, and sustainability, our framework theorizes the complex, multi-way evolving interplay through three central themes revolving around the drivers, dimensions, and impacts of business innovation for sustainability through the lens of the SDGs. We explain these dimensions below. Drivers of innovation . Our findings suggest that two sets of inter-related factors act as main antecedents driving innovation, answering the questions ‘why ’ and ‘how ’ innovation is taking place. The first set of factors relate to sustainable development challenges across the economic, environmental, and social dimensions that act as major drivers, thus answering the ‘why ’ of innovation. These inter-related challenges can be economic (e.g., an increasingly competitive business landscape, need for profit, enhancing organizational performance), environmental (e.g., climate change and natural resource issues), or social (e.g., the rising needs of society, inequities, the range of mounting societal problems). Our findings further reinforce the interconnectedness of these challenges. Therefore, the innovations focusing on environmental sustainability are also found to have an impact in addressing economic challenges (Jouzdani and Govindan, 2021; Sinha et al., 2020a, 2020b; Zhao et al., 2020 ). The second set of factors include technological advancements (e.g., artificial intelligence, big data, blockchain, internet of things), policy imperatives, as well as corporate social responsibility initiatives as critical drivers answering the ‘how ’ of innovation. The application of technology-driven innovation in agriculture and energy sectors emerged as a prominent driver of innovation impacting all three dimensions of sustainability. For example, Quayson et al. (2021)  report how technology can play a role for smallholder farmers and their supply chains to alleviate various social concerns such as fraud, exploitation, corruption, deceit, child labor, and financial exclusion. Dimensions of innovation . In line with earlier research (Crossan and Apaydin, 2010 ), we conceptualize dimensions of innovation in two broad interrelated themes: (i) innovation as a proce ss and (ii) innovation as an outcome  at the organizational level. Innovation as a process reflects the ‘where ’ of innovation, focusing on two facets: (i) the country and economic development setting (e.g., developed versus developing economies) and (ii) the industry/sector within which the innovation is taking place. While innovation is critical for any country, our review confirms dominance of studies addressing SDG issues in developing countries. The high incidence of research focusing on developing countries could be explained by the severity of the sustainable development challenges faced by those countries’ populations, as well as the focus on innovations that are locally contextualized (e.g., frugal and inclusive innovations providing solutions to address local SDG challenges). We also found instances where such innovations are driven by technology to address local sustainability challenges. The sectors where innovation was more dominant ranged from agriculture and food, energy, healthcare, and tourism. Innovation as an outcome reflects the ‘what ’ or ‘what kind ’, focusing on two facets: (i) types of innovation (e.g., products/services, processes) and (ii) the forms of innovations (e.g., green innovation, inclusive innovation, frugal innovation). As reported earlier, we found innovations—across different types and forms—mostly related to environmental aspects. These environmental innovations focused on issues such as carbon emissions, energy innovations, cleaner production, circular economy, green creativity, environmental reporting, air pollution, ecological footprint, and fossil fuel consumption. We also found technology playing an important role in enabling these types and forms of innovations. The types  of product/services ranged from energy, financial, and technological across agricultural extension services, financial services, supply chain, and tourism, whereas the types of processes include business process innovation, sustainable business models, innovation in management, planning, supply chain operations, and systems thinking for innovative operations enabled by technologies (Jouzdani and Govindan, 2021 ). Among the different forms  of innovations, three are found to be dominant: green innovations (e.g., green buildings, living lab, plant clinics), social innovations (e.g., frugal, grassroot, or inclusive innovation), and financial inclusion innovations (e.g., catastrophe bonds, insurance, micro-franchise network for BoP). Our findings reveal the dynamics and interplay of different types and forms of innovation for addressing sustainable development challenges, which further reaffirms the inter-relatedness of the three dimensions of economic, environmental, and social sustainability. For example, innovations could solve environmental problems while benefiting business economically. This was mainly through cost reduction and mitigation as well as adapting and building resilience, which also had spillover social implications. For example, Zhao et al. (2020)  concluded that reduction of air pollution will not only promote SDGs that are directly linked with the environment, such as SDG 3 (good health and well-being) and SDG 15 (life on land), but it can also have considerable impact on SDGs that promote economic and social sustainability such as SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 9 (industrial, innovation and infrastructure), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), and SDG 17 (global partnerships). Impacts of innovation . Our analysis suggests that SDGs act as both a means and an end of innovation. SDGs act as a platform highlighting the need for sustainable development focusing on specific challenge areas. They also act as a means for encouraging innovation to occur by exposing particular problems relating to individual SDGs. The different dimensions of innovations contribute to specific SDGs, thus creating impact. Six most dominant SDGs (e.g., SDGs 12, 13, 9, 7, 8 and 2) were found to be impacted by innovation, thus creating impact in the fields of responsible consumption, climate change, industry, innovation and infrastructure, clean energy, work, economic growth, and poverty. However, as SDGs are interlinked, any innovations directed towards achieving one SDG are likely to contribute to the realization of a variety of other SDGs. Nevertheless, we found a paucity of research addressing this issue of interconnectedness. As the SDGs essentially operationalize sustainable development and provide a clear road map towards sustainable development, the interconnectedness between SDGs could therefore be explored in future research. Third and finally , we highlight extant gaps that create opportunities for future research on business, innovation, and sustainability through the lens of the SDGs, which will be discussed below.  5.2 Managerial implications Our study presents several managerial implications. Firstly, businesses addressing sustainable development challenges should explicitly link their innovations to the SDGs. Our analysis identified agriculture and food, energy, healthcare, and tourism as industries where environmental sustainability presents significant challenges. Nevertheless, businesses must also report their innovations concerning economic and social sustainability, in addition to environmental sustainability, to provide stakeholders with a comprehensive understanding of their innovations and active engagement with the SDGs. Noteworthily, proactive engagement requires businesses to view the SDGs as opportunities and build capacity to develop sustainable innovative solutions, benefiting not only sustainable development challenges but also sustained competitive advantage. Additionally, businesses should involve relevant stakeholders (e.g., customers, employees, communities) in developing solutions to ensure that the value that they design, develop, and deliver (i.e., the 3Ds) genuinely satisfies their intended beneficiaries, not as an act of sustainability-washing (i.e., charade or unsubstantiated claims about the organization’s engagement with sustainability). While sustainability endeavors are typically reported through environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting, businesses should not treat this activity as a matter of compliance, but rather as a guiding philosophy for their aspirations, actions, and activities (i.e., the 3As). This approach establishes and maintains their legitimacy as a sustainable business and serves as a mechanism for guiding their efforts in continuous improvement. This aligns with Lim, Ciasullo et al. (2023) , who also proposed that businesses should engage in total quality management to track and enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of their sustainability innovations. Without continuous improvement in an era of proliferating mandatory sustainability reporting, businesses may risk losing their competitive advantage from the signaling power of demonstrating economic sustainability through their investments in environmental and social sustainability innovations (Prasad et al., 2022 ). Our findings also have implications for businesses, policymakers, and researchers to examine sustainable development solutions in developing economies, particularly frugal innovations, and explore their applicability in developed economies with contextual considerations. Our findings underscore that frugal innovations do not necessarily require abundant resources, but rather an innovative mindset and creative thinking. To facilitate the business, innovation, and sustainable development interface for achieving the SDG agenda, the focus on learning transfer should be multifaceted (e.g., North-North, North-South, South-North, and South-South). Moreover, policymakers should foster quintuple-helix and multi-sectoral partnerships between academia, industry, government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and societies to support innovation capacity building. Lastly, our findings offer implications for businesses and policymakers to harness technological advancements (e.g., artificial intelligence, big data analytics, blockchain, internet of things) in developing new innovations for addressing sustainable development challenges. Examples of technology-based innovations include redesigning products and services sustainably (e.g., BRAC’s digital cash transfers; HappyTap, a portable handwashing solution by the TRANSFORM initiative; Azmat and Voola, 2020 ) and replacing inefficient manual processes (e.g., digital signatures to reduce paper waste and automation for more efficient organizational processes).  5.3 Future research directions Our analysis identified several gaps in the literature. We present these gaps across the three elements of our conceptual framework (Fig. 4 ): (i) drivers of innovation, (ii) dimensions of innovations, and (iii) impacts of innovations. These gaps offer multiple avenues for researchers to engage with and advance our understanding of the business discourse on innovation and sustainability through the lens of the SDGs. Drivers of innovation.  Technology emerged as a strong set of factors within the drivers of innovation. Our findings reveal numerous innovations (e.g., living labs, mobile apps, off-grid solar systems, renewable energy, smart textiles) enabled by technology (e.g., artificial intelligence, big data analytics, blockchain, internet of things). However, the focus on the diffusion of clean technologies emerged as a gap. It would be valuable to understand how novel and emerging technologies can be diffused to enhance the implementation of the SDGs. Furthermore, for innovations specifically addressing environmental or climate change aspects, it would be interesting to gain a nuanced understanding of types and forms of innovation and their relative effects on the SDGs. Lastly, new innovations related to the metaverse have potential implications for SDG implementation (Tlili et al., 2023 ). For example, can the metaverse accelerate the advancement of the SDGs by using virtual reality to test novel SDG implementation strategies? These directions can be summarized into the following research questions for future research:• What types and forms of technological innovation are effective in implementing climate- and environment-related SDGs?  • What types and forms of technological innovation are effective in addressing societal issues related to SDGs?  • How do new technological innovations impact the SDG agenda overall? Are there any tradeoffs of these technological innovations?  • How can clean technologies be diffused across polluting industries/sectors such as agriculture, energy, and transport in developed and developing countries?  • What implications do innovations relating to the metaverse have on implementing the SDGs?    Dimensions of innovation.  We identify research gaps across several areas within the dimensions of innovation. From a country and economic development  perspective, research in developing countries features prominently in our review, likely because societal challenges are more evident in developing countries. However, the SDGs are equally important for both developing and developed countries. Therefore, more research examining the interaction between the SDGs in developed countries is encouraged (Berrone, Rousseau, Ricart, Brito, & Giuliodori, 2023 ). To this end, it would be useful to investigate the following research questions:• Are there any differences in how innovation interacts with the SDGs based on whether a country is developed or developing? What are the implications for business innovations and the SDGs?  • How can research conducted in developing countries inform research in developed countries and vice versa?  • What lessons of innovations can be learned for transfer of knowledge across developed versus developing countries and vice versa, and within developing (e.g., South-South) and developed (e.g., North-North) countries for the SDG agenda?    From the industry/sector  perspective, the agriculture and food industry features prominently in our review, followed by energy, healthcare, and tourism. Although these are important industries/sectors, research must focus on other heavy polluting industries/sectors such as infrastructure, manufacturing, mining, and steel to provide a more holistic view of how innovation and the SDGs interact. This can be achieved by equally prioritizing economic, environmental, and societal issues, even in a scaffolded way (see Lim, 2022a ). The current literature predominantly focuses on the environment and how innovation impacts environmental strategies. To advance the field, we proposed the following research questions:• How can different types and forms of innovation be used in heavy polluting industries/sectors and how do they differ and compare to less polluting industries/sectors?  • What are the potential trade-offs and synergies of the SDGs associated with innovation in heavy polluting industries/sectors?    From the methodological  perspective, most studies were developed through theoretical and quantitative analysis, though only four articles had an explicit policy focus, with only eight articles adopting mixed methods. As mentioned earlier, it is essential for scholars to engage not only in scholarly outputs but also to extend their work more proactively to impact policy. Therefore, an important question for future research is:• How can scholars translate their work on the SDGs so that it has relevance for practice and policy?    From an externality  perspective, only two articles (Barbier and Burgess, 2020; Ranjbari et al. 2021 ) discussed the impact of a mega disruption, COVID-19, on the SDGs. Due to the dramatic implications of COVID-19, we encourage researchers to take a nuanced approach to further understand the implications of this pandemic on innovations, both positive and negative for the SDGs:• How has COVID- 19 impacted the innovation process across developed and developing countries and what implications does it have for the SDGs (positive and negative)?    Impacts of innovation.  Within the impacts of innovation, the interconnectedness of the SDGs  emerged as a strong gap that deserve further attention. Our analysis highlights the link of innovation to specific SDGs (e.g., SDG 12 appearing in 21 articles (19%), SDG 13 and SDG 9 appearing in 20 articles (18%), and SDG 7 and SDG 8 appearing in 14 articles (12%)). As the SDGs are interconnected, there are potential synergies and trade-offs for research to consider, which appear as a gap in the current literature. There is a need for scholars to explore the interconnectedness between the SDGs alongside the role of innovation, so that synergies can be leveraged and trade-offs can be addressed. This provides an opportunity for scholars to engage in research that attempts to understand how innovation engages with the SDGs that are not dominant. To this end, we suggest future research in areas of SDGs that were less dominant in the current review:• How does innovation engage with SDG 1, SDG 3, SDG 4, SDG 5, SDG 6, SDG 10, SDG 11, SDG 14, SDG 15, SDG 16, and SDG 17?  • How can business research on innovation on specific SDGs be linked to analyze the SDG trade-offs and synergies?    Furthermore, our review revealed that articles focused on the interaction between innovation and the SDGs on environmental issues, such as climate change and responsible consumption, as opposed to social issues, such as poverty and hunger. This focus on environmental issues is encouraging as it emphasizes climate change as a global priority with significant effects on economic and social aspects of sustainable development. This presents business scholars at the intersection of innovation and the SDGs with the opportunity to delve deeper into innovations that progress human and social aspects as specified in the SDGs. To this end, we suggest the following research questions:• Why do SDGs related to environmental issues feature more prominently in scholarly research in business?  • What factors motivate business scholars to engage in certain types of SDGs (i.e., economic, environmental, and social)?  • How do innovation and innovative strategies interact with the SDGs that promote economic and social sustainability (SDG 1, SDG 3, SDG 5, SDG 8, SDG 9, and SDG 10)?     5.4 Limitations Our study also has limitations. First, as our review uses only two databases—i.e., Business Source Complete and Scopus—there is a possibility that some relevant research may have been omitted. Second, by focusing only on the “A*” and “A” ranked business journals in the ABDC JQL, we had to leave out other relevant articles in journals like Sustainability . Nevertheless, our study is the first to undertake a holistic systematic literature review of business research on innovation and sustainability through the lens of the SDGs, advancing discussion on what is known in this field and identifying gaps and opportunities, thus laying the foundation for future research. In conclusion, our analysis identified several gaps and opportunities for future research across the three elements of our conceptual framework: drivers, dimensions, and impacts of innovations. By addressing these gaps and exploring the proposed research questions, scholars can advance our understanding of the business discourse on innovation and sustainability through the lens of the SDGs, which will ultimately contribute to the achievement of the global sustainable development agenda.
