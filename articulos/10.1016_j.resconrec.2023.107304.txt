                  Reactive nitrogen (Nr) is indispensable for agricultural production and human nutrition. But if not managed well, it is detrimental to human health and ecosystem services, impeding the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) achievement. Here we conduct a structured evidence-based review to explore the role of nitrogen (N) in achieving 17 SDGs with 169 targets. We demonstrate that Nr use can enable the accomplishment of 76 targets, while potentially hinder 36 targets. The progress toward the N-related SDG targets varies significantly across countries, reflecting diverse prioritization of the SDGs. Mitigation measures targeting one specific Nr pollution may bring trade-offs among targets, emphasizing the need for integrated Nr management across sectors and regions to achieve the overall SDGs synergistically. We highlight the technical, structural, and consumption-based measures on N management to achieve synergies among different SDGs across countries.

Each box to the right of the relevant SDG represents a target. There are 17 SDGs with a total of 169 targets. The numbers or letters on the box represent the target number derived from the UN 2030 Agenda. The impact of anthropogenic N on the target was categorized as positive and negative, and the interacting force was divided into three levels: “high”, “medium” and “low”. Positive effects of N on target achievement are highlighted in green, while adverse effects are highlighted in yellow. Targets classified as “high” are those where N directly impacts the target's achievement. Targets classified as “moderate” are impacted by Nr indirectly in terms of human development capacity or economic development, or ecosystem health and resilience. Targets classified as “low” impact refer to technical, social, administrative, or economic interventions indirectly related to N. No highlighting indicates the absence of identified evidence but does not necessarily mean that N does not affect the achievement of the target. Supplementary Table S1  gives detailed information about N and SDG targets.  Fig 1   Fig. 2 Interactions among the SDGs and N globally. In Fig. 2a , the relationship between pairs of SDGs is depicted using color-coded boxes (green for synergy and orange for trade-offs). The numbers within the boxes represent the percentage of interactions (synergy or trade-offs) between the two SDGs. For example, between SDG1 and SDG2, 1000 pairs of indicators were identified as showing synergy, while 887 pairs indicated trade-offs globally. Therefore, the percentage of synergy in SDG1 and SDG2 is calculated as 53 %, while the percentage of trade-offs is 47 %. In Fig. 2b , the synergy (green) and trade-off (yellow or orange) are shown by the lines between SDGs. The thickness of the lines between two SDGs reflects the share of relationships observed within each goal. For instance, if there are 1000 pairs of indicators identified as synergistic among all 136 SDG pairs, and 100 of these 1000 indicators are identified as synergistic between SDG1 and the other 16 SDGs, with 10 of those 100 involving both SDG1 and SDG2, then the thickness of the green line (synergy) between SDG1 and SDG2 would be 0.01. The arc length for each SDG represents the number of indicators observed with a significant correlation. The longer the arc length, the more data indicate a significant correlation between this SDG and other SDGs. All the data are sourced from Anderson et al. (2022) . Lines between N and SDGs indicate the impact of N on SDGs based on Fig. 1 : positive (green) and negative (orange). The arrows on the lines between N and SDGs represent the direction of the impact of N on SDGs. The lines without arrows between SDGs indicate that the relationship between SDGs is based on correlation analysis and does not imply causation.  Fig 2   Fig. 3 Spatial variations of N-related SDG indicators. These are the sustainability scores for cereal yields (a), the Sustainable Nitrogen Management Index (SNMI), which is defined based on two efficiency measures in crop production: NUE and crop yield (b), total Nr emissions from the production side (c), Nr emissions spatial intensity (NrSI), which incorporates agricultural, industrial, and residential land uses into the calculation to describe the spatial intensity of Nr losses (d), production-based per capita N emissions (NrPI) (e), and per capita Nr emissions embodied in imports (Nr-trade PI) (f). Among these indicators, (a), (b), (d), and (e) are obtained from the Sustainable Development Report 2022 (UN, 2022 ), while the others are adapted from the same report based on their respective calculation methods. The primary data regarding total Nr emissions from the production side are sourced from Oita et al. (2016) , covering all Nr emissions during the production of goods and services. Nr emissions spatial intensity measures Nr emissions per hectare of productive land. Detailed data can be found in the Materials and Methods  section and Supplementary Table S2 .

Reactive nitrogen (Nr) is indispensable for agricultural production and human nutrition. But if not managed well, it is detrimental to human health and ecosystem services, impeding the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) achievement. Here we conduct a structured evidence-based review to explore the role of nitrogen (N) in achieving 17 SDGs with 169 targets. We demonstrate that Nr use can enable the accomplishment of 76 targets, while potentially hinder 36 targets. The progress toward the N-related SDG targets varies significantly across countries, reflecting diverse prioritization of the SDGs. Mitigation measures targeting one specific Nr pollution may bring trade-offs among targets, emphasizing the need for integrated Nr management across sectors and regions to achieve the overall SDGs synergistically. We highlight the technical, structural, and consumption-based measures on N management to achieve synergies among different SDGs across countries.

However, achieving 17 SDGs with 169 targets on time is challenging due to existing trade-offs between goals (Nilsson et al., 2016 ) and limited understanding of effective management strategies for the SDGs (Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017 ). Nitrogen (N) cascades, involving N cycling and transformations across ecosystems (including ammonia (NH3 ), nitrous oxide (N2 O), nitrogen oxides (NOx : NO and NO2 ), and nitrates (NO3 − )), are intricately linked with many SDGs (Galloway et al., 2003 ). As a limited nutrient for food production and human nutrition, N is critical to zero hunger (SDG 2) (Ladha et al., 2020 ). However, 80 % of anthropogenic N is released into the environment (Sutton et al., 2022 ), resulting in detrimental impacts on both human well-being (SDG 3) and the environment (SDG 6 clean water, SDG 14 life below water, SDG 15 life on land). Given both substantial positive and negative effects of Nr, it is crucial to understand the comprehensive role of N within the framework of the SDGs to achieve them. A critical step toward achieving sustainable N management and the SDGs is reducing reactive N (Nr: all N forms, except dinitrogen gas) waste by half before 2030 (Sutton et al., 2021 ). Agricultural nutrient management, especially the integrated management of N and phosphorus, significantly contributes to most of the 17 SDGs (Kanter and Brownlie, 2019 ; Ladha et al., 2020 ). However, current research primarily focuses on the overall effect of Nr on the SDGs, overlooking the potential variations in effects of N management on each of the 169 targets within the framework of the 17 SDGs. Actions taken to achieve one target can either reinforce or hinder progress toward another, resulting in both synergies and trade-offs (Nilsson et al., 2018 ; Pradhan et al., 2017 ). Therefore, analysing the role of N management in achieving the 17 SDGs with 169 targets is essential for enhancing synergies among the targets and minimizing trade-offs for overall success. This study aims to evaluate how Nr influences the achievement of the 17 SDGs along with their 169 targets, and to investigate strategies for managing Nr in the context of these SDGs. A structured literature review was conducted for each target to assess the relationship and significance of Nr's impact. Moreover, we analysed the N management priorities of 170 countries as they work toward achieving the SDGs, using six selected N-related SDG indicators. Furthermore, we synthesized the effects of N management options throughout the production and consumption chain concerning N-related SDGs, identifying regional and global pathways to effectively achieve the overall SDGs.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 A structured evidence-based review A structured evidence-based review was conducted to address two key questions among the 169 targets: (a) Can Nr affect the achievement of these targets? and (b) Is there any published evidence demonstrating a positive or negative role of Nr in target achievement? If Nr can influence the achievement of a target, its impact on each individual target was categorized as either positive or negative, with the strength of interaction further classified as “high”, “moderate”, or “low”. Targets classified as “high” are those where Nr directly influences the target's achievement such as the survival of organisms, while targets classified as “moderate” are impacted by Nr indirectly in terms of human development capacity or economic development, or ecosystem health and resilience. Lastly, targets classified as “low” impact encompass technical, social, administrative, or economic interventions indirectly related to Nr. For most of the SDG targets, we consider the impact of physical Nr use on those targets. However, this approach changes when we discuss SDGs that emphasize increased investment, improved scientific and technological research and development, knowledge dissemination, integrated policy formulation, and strengthened cross-regional cooperation. In these cases, our focus transitions towards the international institutions and communities engaged in N management, rather than the physical forms of Nr, to achieve these SDG targets. The detailed results obtained from this review process are presented in Supplementary Table S1 .  2.2 Synergy and trade-off between SDGs The analysis of synergy and trade-offs among the SDGs of 170 countries in this article is based on the work of Anderson (Anderson et al., 2022 ). They utilized SDG indicator data from 2018 and applied non-parametric Spearman rank correlation (rs ) analysis to investigate interactions between pairs of SDG indicators. A rs  value greater than 0.6 with a p -value less than 0.05 indicates synergy between the two indicators, while a rs  value lower than -0.6 with a p -value less than 0.05 indicates a trade-off. The results of this analysis were aggregated at the global level based on goals and targets, resulting in 136 SDG pairs and 5016 target pairs. The interactions of SDG indicators between goals were quantified by their percentages of synergies and trade-offs in indicator pairs, excluding those without statistically significant correlations (Fig. 2a ). For example, between SDG1 and SDG2, there are 10 pairs of indicators indicating synergy, 5 pairs indicating trade-offs, and 3 pairs with no statistically significant correlation. Therefore, the percentage of synergy in SDG1 and SDG2 is calculated as 67 %, while the percentage of trade-offs is 33 %. Moreover, the degree of interaction between a pair of SDGs out of the 17 is quantified as the percentage of their synergies to the total number of synergies in the 136 pairs of SDGs. For instance, if there are 1000 pairs of indicators identified as synergistic among all 136 SDG pairs, and 100 of these 1000 indicators are identified as synergistic between SDG1 and the other sixteen SDGs, with 10 of those 100 involving both SDG1 and SDG2, then the thickness of the green line (synergy) between SDG1 and SDG2 would be 0.01 (Fig. 2b ).  2.3 N-related indicators We use six indicators to explore the pressing challenges of SDGs across countries in N use. Four SDG indicators directly related to Nr usage have been selected from among all SDG indicators. These indicators include cereal yield, the sustainable N management index (SNMI), per capita Nr emissions (NrPI), and per capita Nr emissions embodied in imported goods and services (Nr-trade PI). Cereal yield focuses on dry grain production, measured in tons per hectare of harvested land, excluding hay, green crops, and grazing. The SNMI is defined as the Euclidean distance from an ideal point in terms of targets for N use efficiency (NUE) and yield (Zhang et al., 2022 ). A smaller SNMI indicates better performance in both crop yield and NUE. NrPI is calculated by dividing production-based total Nr emissions (sum of NH3 , NOx , N2 O, and NO3 − ), whether for domestic consumption or export, by the total population in a country. Nr-trade PI, on the other hand, only considers Nr emissions embodied in imported goods and services and excludes domestically produced emissions. It is calculated by dividing the Nr emissions embedded in imported goods by the total population. In order to facilitate inter-indicator comparisons, following the SDG methodology, the four aforementioned indicators were standardized to SDG scores ranging from 0 to 100.The scores for all four of these SDG indicators were derived from the Sustainable Development Report 2022 (SDR 2022) (UN, 2022 ). Furthermore, in this research, two indicators were adapted from the SDG indicator bank: total Nr emissions and Nr emissions spatial intensity (NrSI). Raw data on total Nr emissions were obtained from Oita (Oita et al., 2016 ) and SDR 2022. NrSI incorporates agricultural, industrial, and residential land uses to assess the spatial intensity of Nr losses (Liang et al., 2018 ). To calculate NrSI, the total Nr emissions are divided by the land area associated with Nr emissions. The agricultural land area data were obtained from FAOSTAT (FAO, 2023 ), while the urban land area data were sourced from the European Space Agency (ESA, 2017 ). Both total Nr emissions and NrSI are rescaled to a numerical range of 0-100, which is referred to as the SDG score. This scaling methodology, as explained in SDR 2022, enables meaningful comparisons between countries and indicators. Further details can be found in Supplementary Table S2 .  2.4 Collection of N management strategies To identify technical mitigation strategies for Nr pollution, we conducted a systematic review of published articles that employed meta-analysis as a research method since 2010. The method of meta-analysis allowed us to gain a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of various technical options in addressing Nr pollution. We prioritized the most recent and extensively studied articles, particularly those with a global scope, when multiple articles investigated the same Nr management practice. Regarding structural mitigation options and consumption-side measures, their potential mitigation effects are primarily based on scenario designs described in published articles, given that these measures have not yet gained widely real-world implementation. Detailed references list can be found in Supplementary Table S4 .   3 Nitrogen uses and the SDGs A structured literature review shows that Nr utilization has an impact on the realization of 99 out of 169 targets (58 %) across all 17 SDGs (Fig. 1  ). Nr utilization can facilitate the achievement of 76 out of these 99 targets but may hinder 36 targets, highlighting the critical importance of integrated and sustainable N management in advancing the SDGs. 3.1 Positive impacts of Nr use on the SDGs As a limit nutrient for all living organisms, Nr uses will directly impact SDGs related to agricultural production, human nutrition needs, and ecosystem productivity. Synthetic N fertilizer is believed to feed about half of the global population (Erisman et al., 2008 ). Adequate N fertilizer application can improve agricultural productivity and food accessibility (Targets 2.1, 2.3, 2.4) (Jayne and Sanchez, 2021 ), contributing to eradicating protein-energy malnutrition (Target 2.2) and reducing maternal and child mortality (Targets 3.1, 3.2) (Drammeh et al., 2019 ; Graham et al., 2004 ). During the growth of plants, N supply has a positive effect on biomass water-use efficiency (Target 6.4) (Brueck and Senbayram, 2009 ). Additionally, N deposition promotes tree growth and increases plant N content in N-limited ecological regions, benefiting herbivores with high N requirements through the food web (Meunier et al., 2016 ). Long-term N deposition also can enhance soil carbon sequestration in tropical forests (Lu et al., 2021 ) and reduce soil organic matter decomposition in temperate forests without microbial growth limitations (Janssens et al., 2010 ). These findings have important implications for predicting terrestrial carbon dioxide (CO2 ) sinks and protecting terrestrial system and their associated services (Targets 15.1, 15.4). Moreover, the role of N fertilizer in promoting food security extends beyond agricultural benefits, influencing various aspects of social development. It makes a significant contribution to poverty eradication, fosters economic growth, mitigates the degradation of natural habitats, and advances universal education, particularly in the least developed countries. Nearly 80 % of the extremely poor population lives in rural areas, where they rely on agricultural activities for their households (Castaneda et al., 2016 ). Food insecurity is a sensitive indicator of poverty, closely associating with the resilience of the poor (Oluoko-Odingo, 2011 ). Previous research has revealed a self-reinforcing relationship between impoverished soils and chronic poverty (Barrett and Bevis, 2015 ). The poor economic status of farmers can limit agricultural investments in low soil quality, with fertilizer use often being the primary factor for improving land productivity. Consequently, low-fertility soils lacking fertilizer inputs can restrict adequate protein intake and household asset accumulation, further hindering farmers’ investments in agricultural production and soil fertility improvement, exacerbating poverty, and weakening resilience to hazards (Targets 1.1, 1.2, 1.5) (Barrett and Bevis, 2015 ). Transitioning from expanding land area to boosting agricultural productivity growth is seen as a prerequisite for food security and other sectors growth in sub-Saharan Africa (Jayne and Sanchez, 2021 ). Agricultural growth can stimulate the construction of related infrastructure, release labor to enter non-agricultural field and increase their income (Targets 8.1, 8.2, 8.5, 8.6, 9.2, 10.1). However, in 2019, the value added per agricultural labor in Sub-Saharan Africa was less than half of the global average and over 50 times lower than in the United States (one of the most productive countries) (Ritchie, 2022 ). Moreover, increasing agricultural productivity rather than expanding cropland area to ensure food security can help reduce deforestation and biodiversity loss (Targets 15.1-15.5). In 2021, the average crop yield in Sub-Saharan Africa was half that of India and only one-fifth of the yields in the United States (FAO, 2022 ). If the crop yield gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa could be closed, the average habitat loss across the entire African continent would be only 1 % by 2050 (Williams et al., 2021 ). Hunger is one of the obstacles to effective learning. Ensuring that children obtain adequate nutrition positively impacts their subsequent access to school, enhances after-school performance, and promotes gender equality in educational opportunities (Targets 4.1, 4.2, 4.5) (Jomaa et al., 2011 ; Jukes, 2005 ). However, children make up half of those suffering from hunger in the global food crisis (WFP, 2022 ). The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the global learning crisis, with a one-third increase in the learning poverty rate in low- and middle-income countries, where an estimated 70 % of 10-year-old children are unable to comprehend simple written text (Target 4.6) (World Bank, 2022 ). Similarly, among adults, food insecurity adversely affects their work and academic performance, physical health, and mental well-being, especially women and seniors (Targets 4.3-4.5) (Martin et al., 2023 ). Food insecurity also could increase the risk of female intimate partner violence (Hatcher et al., 2019 ), parental child abuse (Kobulsky et al., 2022 ), and property crimes (Papaioannou, 2017 ) (Targets 5.1-5.3, 16.1, 16.2, 16.4).  3.2 Negative impacts of Nr use on the SDGs Approximately 80 % of anthropogenic Nr is lost to the environment globally (Sutton et al., 2022 ), endangering the achievement of environment and health-related SDGs. Most of the world's Nr is derived from human activities, including fossil fuel combustion, unsustainable agricultural practices, excessive protein consumption, and food waste. Since the 1990s, 95 % of cumulative NOx  emissions have originated from the combustion of fossil fuels (Anenberg et al., 2017 ). Recent research highlights the growing significance of non-fossil fuel NOx  emissions, such as biomass burnings, microbial N cycles in soils, and agricultural practices, which now account for approximately 50 % of total NOx  emissions (Song et al., 2021 ). The production of synthetic N fertilizer is energy-intensive and carbon emissions process, using non-renewable resources such as coal, oil, and natural gas as raw materials. It is estimated that 2.1 % of global CO2  emissions come from the synthetic N fertilizer supply chain (Menegat et al., 2022 ). NOx  contributes to air pollution, including particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) and acid rain, leading to irritation of the human respiratory system (Odo et al., 2022 ) and detrimental effects on soil and plants (Grennfelt et al., 2020 ) (Targets 3.3, 3.4, 3.9, 15.1-15.5). Over the past two decades, global human-induced N2 O emissions, primarily originating from N input to croplands, accounted for an average of 43 % of the total N2 O emissions, reaching to 7.3 Tg N yr−1  (Tian et al., 2020 ). Meanwhile, natural sources from soils and oceans contributed the remaining 57 % of the total emissions (Tian et al., 2020 ). N2 O, as an ozone-depleting substance and the third most significant long-lasting greenhouse gas, increases the risk of skin cancer (Targets 3.4, 3.9) (Diffey, 2003 ), damages species richness in terrestrial and marine ecosystems (Targets 14.2, 15.1, 15.4, 15.5) (Agathokleous et al., 2020 ; Neale et al., 2023 ), exacerbates global warming and climate change. It is estimated that one-third of anthropogenic Nr emissions originating from livestock supply chains (65 Tg N in 2010) (Uwizeye et al., 2020 ). Within the livestock supply chain, the two main forms of Nr pollution are NH3  and NO3 − , which together constitute 86 % of the total Nr emissions. NH3 , when combined with other air pollutants, can contribute to the formation of PM2.5 and ozone. These pollutants can have adverse effects on air quality and the human health, such as maternal and children mortality (Shen et al., 2022 ), respiratory disease (Odo et al., 2022 ) and reproductive disorders (Jurewicz et al., 2018 ) (Targets 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.9). NH3  and NO3 −  are prominent water pollutants known to contribute to eutrophication (X. Liu et al., 2021 ) and exacerbate ocean acidification (Cai et al., 2011 ), resulting in detrimental effects on biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems (Targets 6.6, 14.1-14.3, 14.5). Moreover, high NO3 −  concentrations in drinking water pose a threat to human health, especially for infants and pregnant women, such as causing methemoglobinemia (Fewtrell, 2004 ) (Targets 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.9, 6.1, 6.2). N deposition transports localized Nr pollution and extends it to regional N cycling. In addition to the above-mentioned impacts of Nr pollution on air quality, human health, and aquatic ecosystems, N deposition also poses a threat to terrestrial ecosystems. This includes alterations soil nutrient balance, soil acidification (Bowman et al., 2008 ), degradation of natural habitats (Van Der Wal et al., 2003 ), and the endangerment of plant and soil biodiversity (Targets 2.4, 6.6, 15.3-15.5, 15.8) (Payne et al., 2017 ; Zhang et al., 2022 ). Excessive food intake and waste contribute to Nr pollution from the consumption side. In the United States and other developed countries in Europe, the protein intake of most adults significantly exceeds the Recommended Dietary Intake (0.8 g/kg weight per day) (Mittendorfer et al., 2020 ). Excess intake of protein is excreted and released into the environment in the form of urea, impairing ecosystem health and resulting in economic losses. Approximately 67–100 % of the Nr in human sewage comes from protein consumption (Almaraz et al., 2022 ). If Americans were to follow Recommended Dietary Intake, Nr losses through human excreta could be reduced by half (from 1.33 Tg N yr−1  to 0.78 Tg N yr−1 ) (Almaraz et al., 2022 ). Meanwhile, 30 % of food is wasted globally, with 13 % wasted between harvest and retail, and 17 % wasted at the household, food service, and retail levels (FAO, 2011 ). These unsustainable consumption practices erode the efficient use of resources, including air, water, land, and energy, while also diminishing the resilience of the food system, increasing the likelihood of vulnerable groups being impacted by disasters, and exacerbating climate change, (Targets 1.5, 6.3, 6.4, 7.2, 7.3, 12.1-12.5).  3.3 Role of policies, institutions, and communities involving in Nr management for SDGs Global recognition and concrete action on sustainable Nr management are indispensable for achieving the SDGs. Over the past half-century, several UN agreements related to Nr pollution mitigation have been reached, advancing both scientific and governmental efforts to mitigate Nr pollution (Sutton et al., 2021 ). It started with the Sofia Protocol on NOx , addressing industrial air pollution (UNECE, 1988 ). Subsequently, the Convention on Biological Diversity has expanded its scope to include excess nutrients pollution and emphasized the importance of ecosystem resilience and biodiversity (UNEP, 2011 ). The establishment of the International Nitrogen Management System has furthered the systematic management of N, focusing on coordinating comprehensive Nr management approaches to enhance NUE while reducing Nr pollution (Sutton et al., 2021 ). Reducing Nr waste by half by 2030, as outlined in The Colombo Declaration, marks the first-ever global consensus among governments to enhance N management (UNEP, 2019 ). These international-level organizations and collaborations in Nr management contribute to the achievement of Targets 1.a, 1.b, 2.a, 3.d, 6.5, 6.a, 6.b, 9.4, 9.5, 11.a, 11.b, 12.6-12.b, 13.1-13.b, 14.c, 15.a, 15.b, 17.6, 17.7, 17.14, and 17.16-17.19. The Sustain Africa Program, focusing on the sub-Saharan African region, has made significant contributions to enhancing food security and alleviating poverty (Sustain Africa, 2023 ). This program aims to provide affordable fertilizers and services to farmers, promoting sustainable yield increases and, in turn, mitigating food security challenges (Targets 1.3, 1.4, 1.a, 1.b, 2.4, 2.a, 2.c, 4.7, 11.b, 12.a, 15.b). Serving as a coordination mechanism between the public and private sectors, it brings together farm input suppliers, knowledge providers, implementing partners, and funders (Targets 17.2, 17.3, 17.7, 17.16, 17.17). In 2022, over one million farmers from five African countries have already benefited from affordable fertilizers, seeds, and extension services through this program (Sustain Africa, 2023 ). By mid-2024, Sustain Africa's objective is to support the supply of nearly 200,000 tons of fertilizer to over two million farmers in seven Africa countries (Sustain Africa, 2023 ). The International Fertilizer Association (IFA) is committed to enhancing nutrient production, distribution, and utilization across the entire crop production process (IFA, 2023 ). The IFA collaborates with governments, research institutions, and financial organizations to develop environmentally friendly technologies that reduce the carbon footprint and Nr losses in fertilizer production and application, contributing to ecosystem protection. Simultaneously, it promotes the growth of interconnected industry chains and increases industrial employment rates (Targets 1.4, 2.a, 7.a, 7.b, 9.4, 9.5, 10.b, 12.6, 12.a, 14.c, 17.7,17.16, 17.17).   4 Trade-offs and synergies Interactions among the SDGs include trade-offs and synergies (Nilsson et al., 2016 ). Trade-offs occur when progress in one goal hinders another, while synergies indicate progress in one goal benefits others. Understanding these interactions and N's impact on SDGs is crucial to identify priorities and effective actions. Studies reveal that, there are more synergies than trade-offs among the 17 SDGs globally, indicating that achieving one goal can assist in achieving others (Fu et al., 2019 ; Kroll et al., 2019 ). Among 136 SDG pairs, there are 47 pairs of SDGs (35 %) for which more than 60 % of the total indicators in these pairs were observed to have synergistic relationships (Fig. 2a  ). Within these pairs, it's noteworthy that SDG 17 leads with the highest count of synergistic interactions, amounting to a total of 10 pairs (Fig. 2a ). This underscores the vital importance of international collaboration in driving the comprehensive SDGs forward. As shown in Fig. 1 , international cooperation and research on N management have a positive impact on nine of 19 targets in SDG 17. These positive impacts can be promoted to achieve other SDGs through the synergies between SDG 17 and other goals. Secondly, SDGs 1, 11, and 13 are strongly synergistic, with more than 90 % positive interactions observed in pairwise combinations. This indicates that efforts to achieve any one of these SDGs can significantly enhance the achievement of the other two. Taking action to mitigate Nr pollution, for example, aids in the attainment of SDG 13 by reducing the probability of extreme climate events, subsequently lowering the number of disasters and casualties (SDG 11), especially among the poor and vulnerable populations (SDG 1). Lastly, SDGs 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, and 15 form a group with synergistic effects, with pairwise synergies accounting for more than 60 % of the interactions. Effective N utilization positively contributes to achieving SDGs 4 and 5, while goals within SDGs 6, 7, 14, and 15 exhibit both positive and negative impacts associated with N management. Currently, low NUE in the food production and consumption chain hinders the attainment of SDGs 6, 7, 14, and 15, thereby diminishing the potential for synergy among these SDGs. The arcs for SDG 3, 8 and SDG 12 are longer than those for the other SDGs because the observed correlated indicators are primarily found within these three SDGs, accounting for a total of 62 % (Fig. 2b ). In Fig. 2a , 67 % of indicator pairs between SDG 8 and SDG 12 demonstrate synergies rather than trade-offs, indicating a mutually reinforcing relationship. However, more than 50 % of the observed indicators between SDG 8 and SDG 1-7 (not limited to SDG 3), as well as between SDG 12 and SDG 1-7, exhibit trade-offs rather than synergies (Fig. 2a ). Hence, in the pursuit of SDG 8 and 12, it is crucial to find a way to prevent potential trade-offs that could hinder the achievement of SDG 1-7 while making full use of the synergies among them. Improving NUE contributes to the achievement of SDG 12, while N adoption and utilization can promote the attainment of SDGs 1, 2, 3, and 4. When combined with the strong synergies observed among SDGs 4-7, as well as the synergies between SDG 8 and SDG 12, this will facilitate the overall accomplishment of the SDGs. For SDG10 and SDG16, 93 % of the indicator pairs are observed to have synergistic relationships (Fig. 2a ). The use of N can boost agricultural productivity, resulting in higher income for the lowest-income populations (SDG 10) and a decrease in violence and crime (SDG 16) However, it should be noted that the achievement of SDG10 and SDG16 involves trade-offs with most other goals, revealing complex mechanisms that could potentially hinder the realization of these SDGs (Fig. 2a ). It is imperative to give special attention to reversing these trends, ensuring their expected positive influence on other objectives and the successful implementation of the 2030 agenda. Trade-offs and synergies between SDGs vary across countries based on income (Kroll et al., 2019 ; Lusseau and Mancini, 2019 ). Low-income and lower-middle-income countries may make progress toward all 17 SDGs without significant trade-offs (Lusseau and Mancini, 2019 ). However, for upper-middle-income and high-income countries, achieving all SDGs requires transformative changes (Lusseau and Mancini, 2019 ). Maintaining flexibility in N management provides an alternative solution for all countries at different stages of development. Maintaining flexibility in N management serves as an alternative for countries at different stages of development to avoid trade-offs and achieve all 17 SDGs globally. For example, increasing N fertilizer application to narrow the yield gap and subsequently reduce prevalent hunger and poverty seems to be a priority for low-income and middle-income countries, resulting in compounded positive effects on other SDGs (Fig S1, S2 ). In high-income and upper-middle-income countries, improving resource utilization, protecting ecosystems, and mitigating climate change contribute to the comprehensive achievement of the SDGs (Fig S3, S4 ).  5 Inequalities of N-related SDGs across countries Nr has both positive and negative impacts on the SDGs, with countries facing varying challenges based on their development stages. Low-income African countries should prioritize harnessing Nr's positive role in agricultural production and food supply to achieve SDG 1 and SDG 2 (Figs. 3  , 4  ). In contrast, emerging economies that have largely overcome poverty and hunger must be cautious about the adverse effects of Nr on achieving SDGs (Figs. 3 , 4 ). Cereal yield serves as an indicator for SDG 2, reflecting the positive impact of N. Most countries, except those in Africa, have achieved the targets for cereal yield (scoring higher than 34) (Fig. 3a ), emphasizing the potential of N fertilizers in attaining SDG 2 in Africa. The SNMI, which combines crop yield and NUE, assesses the environmental performance in agricultural production (Zhang et al., 2022 ). North American and European countries have scored above 60 on the SNMI (Fig. 3b ). However, countries like China and India, while meeting cereal yield targets, scored below 60 on the SNMI, indicating lower cropland NUE (Fig. 3b ). On the other hand, the low SNMI performance in African countries is mainly due to low yields rather than NUE (Fig. 3a , b). Some African countries have NUE exceeding 1, primarily due to low N inputs and N mining in the soil. NrPI and Nr-trade PI are SDG 12 indicators, reflecting the negative effects of N on SDGs. African and Asian countries have achieved their targets, scoring above 80 on both indicators (Fig. 3d , e ). South American net exporters, like Brazil and Argentina, meet the Nr-trade PI but not the NrPI target, indicating the impact of global consumer demand on local N pollution (Fig. 3d , e ). However, it's worth noting that these indicators are population-dependent and may not fully capture the significant environmental and health impacts of Nr emissions. A more comprehensive understanding can be gained by considering two additional indicators, total production based Nr emissions and NrSI, although they are not part of the official SDG dashboard. Global challenges persist in achieving the production based Nr emission goal, especially considering recent research revealing the exceeding of the safe planetary boundary in N use (Schulte-Uebbing et al., 2022 ). African and Asian countries, whether facing N deficiency or overuse, score lowly on this indicator (Fig. 3e ). NrSI, which integrates agricultural, industrial, and residential land uses, indicates the spatial intensity of Nr losses. Europe, China, India, and Brazil are grappling with NrSI, while Africa, Central Asia, and Australia are approaching or achieving the target. It's noteworthy that some countries with high NrPI scores may exhibit low NrSI (Fig. 3d , e). For instance, Australia experiences higher spatial pressure in NrPI but less in NrSI, whereas Europe, China, and India encounter the reverse challenge, underscoring the urgency of sustainable production. Overall, all country groups face challenges in meeting SNMI and total Nr emissions goals. High-income countries perform worse in NrPI and Nr-trade PI compared to the other groups, while low-income and lower-middle-income countries have not achieved yield targets (Fig. 4 ). Thus, higher-income countries must prioritize reducing Nr pollution for overall SDG progress, while low-income and lower-middle-income countries should focus on harnessing N's positive effects to achieve SDG 2.  6 Empowering Nr management toward SDGs The significant impact of Nr on achieving the SDGs calls for urgent exploration of Nr management practices to maximize synergies and minimize trade-offs. This article categorizes three strategies for Nr pollution mitigation, analysing their effects on SDGs, which include technical, structural, and consumption-based options. It is crucial to recognize that addressing one specific Nr pollution issue may lead to other environmental concerns, emphasizing the importance of integrated N management across systems and regions to achieve the overall SDGs (Fig. 5  ). 6.1 Technical Nr pollution mitigation options In this review, we concentrate on technical solutions to mitigate Nr pollution originating from three main sources: fossil fuel combustion, wastewater treatment, and agricultural production using the Haber-Bosch N fixation process. 6.1.1 Fossil fuel combustion NOx  emission is regarded as an effective indicator for tracking sustainable development because it is more comprehensive and strongly correlated with all three pillars of sustainability than CO2  and other greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions (Shaw and Van Heyst, 2022 ). Over 50 % of NOx  emissions sourced from fossil fuel combustion, including the transport, electricity, and industrial sectors (Song et al., 2021 ). Reducing NOx  emissions from fossil fuel use can contribute to achieving the overall SDGs (Fig. 5 ). A recent comprehensive review highlights that selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is a widely adopted and highly effective technological practice for reducing NOx  and N2 O emissions from fuel combustion and chemical processes (Alves et al., 2022 ). However, it is crucial to note that the SCR process results in NH3  emissions, which underscores the need to investigate alternative technologies like direct NOx  decomposition (Datye and Votsmeier, 2021 ) and selective non-catalytic reduction (Bartholomew, 2001 ), despite their existing efficiency limitations. Significantly, electron beam irradiation shows potential as a viable technique for reducing NOx  emissions, provided it can provide batteries with adequate longevity (Park et al., 2019 ). Substantial technological advancements are anticipated to reduce NOx  emissions from fossil fuel combustion by as much as 70 %, down to 7 Tg yr−1  (Galloway et al., 2008 ).  6.1.2 Wastewater treatment Improving wastewater treatment is closely related to SDG 6 and SDG 14. Biological and physicochemical N removal and recycling practices are two primary options for mitigating N in industrial and household wastewater systems (Karri et al., 2018 ). Biological N removal practice relies on obligate bacteria to achieve nitrification and denitrification (Winkler and Straka, 2019 ). For high-concentration NH3 -N wastewater, two primary chemical methods for N recycling are steam-stripping (Xiong et al., 2018 ) and chemical precipitation (Zhang et al., 2009 ). In the case of low-concentration NH3-N wastewater, the main removal technologies include adsorption (Chen et al., 2018 ), breakpoint chlorination (Pressley et al., 1972 ), and membrane filtration (Hube et al., 2020 ). Despite relatively mature wastewater treatment processes, many low- and middle-income countries lack well-equipped systems. For example, in China, only 56 % of wastewater treatment plants are equipped with N removal facilities, and the average removal rate for these plants is only 55 % (Yu et al., 2019 ).  6.1.3 Agricultural production Agricultural production is the largest source of Nr losses, directly related to human hunger, health, and ecosystem protection. Recent global meta-analyses have summarized cropland N mitigation options and their potential (Gu et al., 2023 ; Lam et al., 2022 ). Most mitigation measures, like “4R nutrient management” (right source, right rate, right time, right place), drip fertigation, and legume-cereal rotation, can effectively reduce total Nr losses by 30–70 % while simultaneously increasing NUE and crop yield (Gu et al., 2023 ). However, some actions to reduce specific Nr losses may lead to an increase in other Nr losses or environmental concerns (Fig. 5 ). For example, deep and splitting fertilizer applications can enhance crop yields and reduce NH3  emissions but may increase Nr leaching (Gu et al., 2023 ). No-tillage, as a conservation agriculture practice, reduces Nr leaching and runoff but increase NH3  and NOx  emissions (Gu et al., 2023 ). While straw return and legume-cereal rotation benefit crop yield, sequester SOC, and improve soil quality, they can also increase cropland GHG emissions (Gu et al., 2023 ). For livestock systems, dietary additives and manure acidification have been proven to have the highest potential to mitigate NH3  emissions globally, up to 45–90 % (Ti et al., 2019 ). Replacing synthetic N fertilizers with manure can reduce Nr losses by at least 30 % (Wei et al., 2021 ), including NH3  emissions, Nr leaching and runoff, without affecting crop yields but increasing methane emissions from paddy fields (Xia et al., 2017 ).   6.2 Structural Nr management strategies In addition to employing mitigation technologies aimed at reducing Nr emissions, the restructuring of both industrial and agricultural sectors has shown to be a potential tool for Nr mitigation. This entails actions such as substituting fossil fuels with biofuels, embracing organic farming practices, optimizing farm size, shifting in crop or livestock species, and introducing coupled farming systems. 6.2.1 Biofuel combustion The industrial revolution transformed the energy system from wood to coal and from animal power to engines. Currently, 80 % of energy consumption relies on non-renewable resources, such as fossil fuels, which presents a significant challenge in reducing GHG emissions (Newell et al., 2020 ). Biofuels are considered as an alternative to replace fossil fuels and mitigate GHG emissions (Fig. 5 ). There are three types of biofuels: food crops (first generation), cellulose-rich crop waste (second generation), and algae (third generation). First-generation biofuels, such as bioethanol from maize, sugar cane, and vegetable oils, are widely used. However, the debate revolves around the decision of whether to use biofuels for refuelling vehicles or to allocate resources to feed the hungry. This debate arises from the fact that the crops needed to produce one terajoule of bioethanol and biodiesel could potentially feed 110 and 90 people, respectively. Moreover, the overall impact of GHG emissions and the potential competition with biodiversity arising from the cultivation of biofuel crops are still uncertain on a global scale (Erisman et al., 2010 ; Escobar et al., 2009 ).  6.2.2 Organic farming Organic farming, characterized by environmentally friendly practices without synthetic inputs like pesticides and synthetic fertilizers (Reganold and Wachter, 2016 ), offers numerous ecosystem benefits compared to conventional agriculture. It aids in land and soil restoration (Gattinger et al., 2012 ), protects biodiversity (Lichtenberg et al., 2017 ), enhances resilience (Brzezina et al., 2016 ), and mitigates climate change (Skinner et al., 2014 ). However, organic farming may also induce trade-offs, as it results in a 19.2 % lower crop yield compared to conventional agriculture and exhibits a 15 % lower yield stability, thus impeding efforts to combat hunger (Knapp and van der Heijden, 2018 ; Ponisio et al., 2015 ). Moreover, when comparing N input intensities, there is no significant difference in N leaching losses between organic and conventional systems (Kirchmann and Bergström, 2001 ; Tuomisto et al., 2012 ). While organic farming can be more profitable than conventional agriculture (Crowder and Reganold, 2015 ), its successful adoption necessitates a transition period and the implementation of supportive policies for a smooth conversion (Reganold and Wachter, 2016 ). The situation is particularly challenging for the least developed countries still struggling with issues of poverty and hunger. Therefore, it is crucial to exercise caution, especially in African countries that have not yet attained SDG 1 and SDG 2, when implementing organic farming policies.  6.2.3 Farm size Optimizing farm size, through its expansion in developing countries, is considered an effective strategy to reduce fertilizer overuse and enhance NUE. A global dataset from 74 countries indicates that for each standard deviation increase in farm size, there is a 102 % decrease in fertilizer use relative to its standard deviation (Wu et al., 2018 ). For example, increasing the average farm size in China to 3.3 hectares would result in a 26 % reduction in synthetic N fertilizer use, a 47 % decrease in N fertilizer losses, and a 114 % increase in farmers’ income (Wu et al., 2018 ). Large-scale agriculture offers additional benefits, including improved energy efficiency (Zhang et al., 2021 ), reduced carbon footprint (Hou et al., 2021 ), lower NH3  emissions (C. Wang et al., 2022 ), and increased income stability for farmers (Noack and Larsen, 2019 ). However, an inverse relationship between farm size and land productivity has been observed, especially as the average farm size declines (Garzón Delvaux et al., 2020 ). The reduction in fertilizer use achieved through larger farm sizes can be significantly offset by accelerated stream channel erosion in certain regions of China (Li et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, deforestation associated with large-scale agriculture can disrupt convective rainfall patterns and lead to increased surface temperatures (Maeda et al., 2021 ). On the other hand, smaller-scale farms tend to exhibit higher crop diversity and non-crop biodiversity levels compared to larger farms (Maeda et al., 2021 ). Therefore, optimizing farm size in combination with diversifying crops could be a strategy that ensures crop yield, improves resource use efficiency, and reduces ecological damage.  6.2.4 Species switching Crop or livestock switching is considered a potential strategy for mitigating Nr pollution. The proportion of harvested land area used for fruit and vegetable production is inversely related to NUE, as indicated by global data from 113 countries (Zhang et al., 2015 ). In 2010, the world average NUE for fruits and vegetables was 0.14, while for soybeans, it was 0.8 (Zhang et al., 2015 ). Differences in crop structure and fertilizer subsidies account for nearly half of the variation in NUE between China and the United States (Zhang et al., 2015 ). China allocates 40 % of its total crop harvested area to fruits and vegetables with a low NUE of 0.1, whereas in the United States, this proportion is only 4 % (FAO, 2022 ). Conversely, China's soybean harvest area accounts for just 10 %, even though they are low N surplus N-fixing crops, while in the United States, the proportion is 60 % (FAO, 2022 ). Optimizing China's corn and soybean production structure, including acreage reallocation and planting area adjustments, could potentially lead to a reduction of more than one-fifth in N fertilizer use and Nr loss by 2035 (Liu et al., 2021 ). Spatial reallocation of crop production is considered a significant opportunity for reducing the environmental impact of global food production. By integrating improved crop management and redistribution, China's food demand in 2030 could be met through increased crop output while simultaneously achieving various environmental benefits, including reductions in irrigation water, N and phosphorus fertilizer input, and GHG emissions (Wang et al., 2022 ; Xie et al., 2023 ). However, there is a trade-off between optimizing crop distribution to increase yield and maintaining crop diversity. The optimization of crop distribution in China is projected to result in a 19 % decrease in effective crop diversity by 2030 compared to 2012 levels (Wang et al., 2022 ). Similar scenarios are observed in the United States, where crop reallocation can mitigate 16 % of the agricultural profit decline caused by climate change while increasing crop yields (Rising and Devineni, 2020 ). The species switching strategy is also applicable for livestock systems. Converting 12.3 % of the world's livestock from monogastric to ruminants could potentially result in a 2 % reduction in Nr emissions and a 5 % decrease in GHG emissions globally in 2019, primarily due to savings in land use for feed production (Cheng et al., 2022 ). However, when implementing species switching, other potential consequences, such as dietary preferences and their impact on farmers’ income (Mozaffarian et al., 2021 ; Tilman and Clark, 2014 ), should be carefully considered to promote the overall achievement of SDGs.  6.2.5 Recoupled crops and livestock production systems The decoupling of crop and livestock production is an important cause of Nr loss, especially in countries with rapid specialized livestock production (Gu, 2022 ). Spatial decoupling impedes the recycling of manure to cropland. Relocating livestock production based on crop distribution can help reduce manure nitrogen loss (Zhang et al., 2019) and mitigate exposure to Nr pollution (Bai et al., 2022 ). International feed trade exacerbates the issue, importing N to countries with industrial livestock production, leading to regional manure overload. Even domestic relocation may not alleviate the excessive manure load caused by the import of substantial amounts of feed, a common scenario frequently observed in the Netherlands (van Grinsven et al., 2018 ). Converting feed trade into animal protein trade and relocating farms to reduce the distance for manure recycling could be an option to reestablish the connection between crop and livestock production, enhance NUE, and contribute to the realization of SDGs.   6.3 Consumption-side options Promoting sustainable production through consumer behaviour is essential for overall sustainable development. Reducing the consumption of animal products and transitioning to healthier diets can effectively reduce Nr losses in feed and animal production, with the extent of impact depending on the type and quantity of meat. For example, limiting animal product protein intake to no more than 29 % of the total can lead to a reduction of 30 Tg N requirements globally by 2050 (Bodirsky et al., 2014 ). Dietary changes have been found to reduce not only Nr emissions but also GHG emissions and land use requirements induced by diets by up to 50 % (Hallström et al., 2015). Additionally, addressing food waste throughout the production and consumption chain and recycling waste for use in cropland can further reduce Nr sources by 56 Tg globally by 2050 (Bodirsky et al., 2014 ). Integrated N management from both production and consumption systems would empower the overall achievement of SDGs. It has been reported that Europe could feed their people successfully by 2050 and reduce Nr losses by 50 % without the need for importing feed. This could be achieved through changes in crop planting structures, recoupling crop and livestock production systems, dietary modifications, and waste recycling (Billen et al., 2021 ). These design sheds light on the goal of “halving Nr waste” and achieving the SDGs. Therefore, further exploration of integrated Nr management options is essential to empower the realization of SDGs. Furthermore, to achieve the SDGs, transformative changes in production and consumption are crucial, involving various industries and stakeholders. The Nitrogen Credit System offers an effective mechanism for shared responsibilities and obligations, not only within countries but also between nations (Gu et al., 2021 ). Within countries, incentive mechanisms can be used to assign obligations and responsibilities to stakeholders along the supply chain, including farmers, suppliers, processors, retailers, consumers, and the government. Internationally, countries that haven't fully utilized the positive effects of N for achieving the SDGs should be allowed to use N for development. For countries facing N pollution due to excessive N input and losses, N allowances can be obtained through Nr emission reduction, like carbon emission allowances. Integrating N use as a right into the international market would involve determining total N emissions, specifying trading principles for obtaining N quotas, and establishing an international market with monitoring and compliance measures. This framework aligns with the fundamental principle of the SDGs, which is “leaving no one behind”.   7 Limitation While the team of authors brought together experts in the field of N, it is possible that some interconnections between anthropogenic N use and the SDGs might have been overlooked, or public evidence of such connections may not yet be available. We acknowledge that assessing the impact of N utilization on SDGs involves some subjectivity, as it relies on our interpretation of published research findings. Additionally, certain local practices related to N management might not have been fully considered. Nevertheless, the results presented in this study are based on published literature and have undergone rigorous evaluation and review by the author group to minimize subjectivity in the assessment.
