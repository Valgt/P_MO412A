                  Measles remains an important cause of childhood mortality in many resource-limited countries. With Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), there has been increasing emphasis on measles vaccination as a key strategy to remarkably improve child survival. While progress has been made towards measles vaccination coverage due to SDG in some settings, there has been no prior study evaluating its impact in Nigeria. To assess the effectiveness of SDG policy implementation on measles vaccination coverage, we examined the changes in first dose of measles vaccination coverage rates among children aged 9–15 months following the implementation of SDG, and changes in spatial patterns of measles vaccination from 2014 to 2019 in Ekiti State, Southwest Nigeria. Using state and local government area-level District Health Information data from January 2014 to December 2019, we conducted interrupted time series (ITS) and spatiotemporal analyses. The ITS evaluated the immediate and continuous effects of SDG policy implementation on the monthly childhood measles vaccination coverage by comparing longitudinal changes in rates between pre-intervention period (January 2014-December 2015) and during-intervention period (January 2016-December 2019). The low and high coverage clusters across the years were detected with spatial cluster analysis. The average state-level measles vaccination coverage rates from 2014 to 2019 was 70.67%. In 2019, coverage rate was 49%—a 35.53% decline from 76% in 2014 and a state-level gap of 46%. The geographical distribution of measles vaccination varied considerably across the local government areas from 2014 to 2019. There was an initial acceleration of vaccination rates (

                              ^
                           
                        
                      = 24.07, p-value = 0.012), but a significant decrease in coverage rates after implementation of SDG policy in Ekiti State (
                        
                           
                              β
                           
                           
                              ^
                           
                        
                      = −1.08, p-value < 0.001). No local government area had accelerated monthly coverage rates following SDG-implementation. Evidence suggests immediate acceleration in coverage rates which could not be sustained during SDG-era and calls for a rethink measles immunization coverage strategy in the state and other resource-limited jurisdictions to ensure vaccination scale-up.

Measles remains an important cause of childhood mortality in many resource-limited countries. With Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), there has been increasing emphasis on measles vaccination as a key strategy to remarkably improve child survival. While progress has been made towards measles vaccination coverage due to SDG in some settings, there has been no prior study evaluating its impact in Nigeria. To assess the effectiveness of SDG policy implementation on measles vaccination coverage, we examined the changes in first dose of measles vaccination coverage rates among children aged 9–15 months following the implementation of SDG, and changes in spatial patterns of measles vaccination from 2014 to 2019 in Ekiti State, Southwest Nigeria. Using state and local government area-level District Health Information data from January 2014 to December 2019, we conducted interrupted time series (ITS) and spatiotemporal analyses. The ITS evaluated the immediate and continuous effects of SDG policy implementation on the monthly childhood measles vaccination coverage by comparing longitudinal changes in rates between pre-intervention period (January 2014-December 2015) and during-intervention period (January 2016-December 2019). The low and high coverage clusters across the years were detected with spatial cluster analysis. The average state-level measles vaccination coverage rates from 2014 to 2019 was 70.67%. In 2019, coverage rate was 49%—a 35.53% decline from 76% in 2014 and a state-level gap of 46%. The geographical distribution of measles vaccination varied considerably across the local government areas from 2014 to 2019. There was an initial acceleration of vaccination rates (β  ^     = 24.07, p-value = 0.012), but a significant decrease in coverage rates after implementation of SDG policy in Ekiti State (β  ^     = −1.08, p-value < 0.001). No local government area had accelerated monthly coverage rates following SDG-implementation. Evidence suggests immediate acceleration in coverage rates which could not be sustained during SDG-era and calls for a rethink measles immunization coverage strategy in the state and other resource-limited jurisdictions to ensure vaccination scale-up.

[1–2]  In 2018, there were estimated 9,769,400 measles cases and 142,300 measles deaths worldwide. [2]  With 1.8 million estimated cases in 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) African region had the third largest measles cases globally after South-East Asia (3.8 million) and Eastern Mediterranean (2.9 million). [2]  However, the African region had the highest estimated cases of measles mortality at 52,600 deaths. [2]  Since measles vaccine became available in 1963, [3]  its widespread use has contributed to the reduction in the global burden of the disease. [2,4]  In 2012, the World Health Assembly endorsed the targets in the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) of 90% national coverage and 80% for every district or equivalent administrative unit for all vaccines in national programmes by 2020. [5]  In 2015, universal coverage for measles immunization (i.e., ≥95%) was also highlighted in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) to be implemented in 2016 and achieved by 2030. In the same vein, the Immunization Agenda 2030 (IA2030) used absence of measles cases as a benchmark for successful implementation of primary health care. [6]  While measles vaccination policies and stages of implementation vary across the countries, [7]  as at the end of 2019, 178 countries offered two doses of measles-containing vaccine (i.e., measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) as part of their routine immunization programs as recommended by the WHO towards elimination of measles. [8]  Nonetheless, measles vaccination coverage continues to be suboptimal in many countries. In 2019, the global coverage of the first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) was 85%, whereas the coverage of the second dose (MCV2) was 71%, with wide variations across the regions and countries. [9–10]  These rates were short of the GVAP targets to eliminate measles in at least five WHO regions by 2020. [5]  The Government of Nigeria introduced a single dose of measles vaccination into the routine national immunization program in 1979 for children aged 9 months. [11]  However, this unsurprisingly was not enough to provide herd immunity, hence the continuous occurrence of fatal measles outbreaks in Nigeria. The measles endemicity in Nigeria has been attributed to low coverage of MCV1. [12]  On this note, in 2006, Nigeria started intensified measles control programs, such as nationwide supplementary immunization activities (SIA), laboratory case-based surveillance and case management through human capacity building, and immunization campaigns. [13]  In addition, a second dose of measles vaccination (MCV2) was implemented in 2019 for children at 18 months in Nigeria (i.e., during SDG implementation phase). Despite all these efforts, Nigeria still has one of the highest numbers of unvaccinated children and reported cases of measles per million population. [2]  It is important to note that during the SDG-era nearly half of children are yet to receive the first dose of routine measles vaccination—58% in 2015 and 46% in 2019. [12]  In general, vaccine hesitancy at the individual and community levels, unavailability of vaccines at scheduled times, shortage of trained providers and geographical inaccessibility to vaccination points are some of the factors that inhibit immunization coverage in Nigeria. [14–16]  Most of the available evidence on measles vaccine coverage in Nigeria have focused on the national- or state-level coverage, with a dearth of statewide studies reporting on local government area (LGA) level coverage and the trends. [17]  It is therefore imperative that vaccination coverage at subnational levels, including LGAs are monitored to assess the progress towards the elimination of measles. In a household survey conducted in 40 districts between 2014 and 2015, Gunnala and colleagues reported that district-level measles vaccine coverage ranged widely between the districts within and across the states. [18]  However, the study was limited to the high risk districts of polio in northern Nigeria, making the findings not generalizable to other parts of the country. Furthermore, a previous study that used geospatial techniques to assess subnational estimates of measles vaccine coverage from household surveys, reported that changes in estimated MCV1 coverage at the local government level between 2013 and 2016–2017 were not significant in over 95% of the LGAs. [19]  However, the study suffered from small cluster-level size which in turn could have reduced the predictive power of the models. As stakeholders’ interest in achieving child-focused SDG targets by 2030 is increasing and no known published study has examined the impact of SDG policies on measles vaccination coverage in Nigeria and its states, this study was conducted to guide programmatic planning of childhood vaccination in Ekiti State. As the aggregated state and LGA-level data on MCV1 are available before and during SDG era (unlike MCV2), we examined the effectiveness of SDG policy change on childhood measles vaccination coverage rates in Ekiti State since its implementation in January 2016 using interrupted time series (ITS) modelling. Also, we used geospatial techniques to evaluate the temporal patterns of MCV1 across LGAs in Ekiti State, Nigeria.  2 Methods 2.1 Study setting This is an analysis of historical measles vaccination (first dose) data of children aged 9–15 months which have been previously collected in Ekiti State. Apart from the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Ekiti State is one of the 36 states in Nigeria. It is located in the southwestern region and had an estimated population of 3.3 million people in 2016, ranking 29th in the national population league table. [20]  Predominantly, the state comprises of the Yoruba ethnic group. It has 16 LGAs, namely, Ado-Ekiti, Efon, Ekiti East, Ekiti South West, Ekiti West, Emure, Gbonyin, Ido-osi, Ijero, Ikere, Ikole, Ilejemeje, Irepodun/Ifelodun, Ise/Orun, Moba and Oye. Across the regions, the population ranged from 59,300 (Ilejemeje) to 427,700 (Ado Ekiti).  2.2 Data source We extracted aggregate state- and LGA-level MCV1 vaccination rates from the Nigeria District Health Information System 2 (DHIS2) [21]  for Ekiti State from 2014 to 2019 (monthly and annual). The DHIS2 is an open source and online health information management tool which was implemented in Nigeria in 2010 as part of the National Health Management Information System (NHMIS) for collecting and analysing routine health data. [22]  The system collects health facility-level data in Nigeria to facilitate decentralized and data-driven health planning at the subnational levels. It is important to note that data quality checks—completeness, correctness, consistency and timeliness were ensured by the DHIS2 team before the data were made available for public use. [23]  The outcome variable— vaccination coverage rate was pre-estimated in the DHIS2 as the percentage of children who had their MCV1 between 9 and 15 months among the population of children aged 9–15 months in Ekiti State. The choice of age-group selected for this study was informed by the Nigerian National Immunization Schedule which recommends that children should receive the first dose of measles vaccination between 9 and 15 months post delivery. Also, data from this target population are routinely reported and used to track measles coverage among children at the national and subnational levels.  2.3 Ethical consideration Considering the aggregated nature of the DHIS database and no interviews with human subjects were conducted, ethical approval was not required for this study. The data extracted from DHIS database contained non-identifiable information about the children studied. Also, this study required no official request to use the secondary dataset for research purpose because DHIS2 is an open-source.  2.4 Statistical analysis Data were analysed using ITS and geospatial methods. The ITS is a quasi-experimental design that is valuable in evaluating the effectiveness of intervention/policy changes from longitudinal data, when randomization is not feasible. [24]  In this “natural” experiment, we evaluated the effect of SDG policy implementation on the childhood measles vaccination coverage in Ekiti State and its LGAs at a predetermined/intervention time point (i.e., January 2016). We hypothesized that SDG policy implementation would produce changes in vaccination coverage rates between January 2016 and December 2019. The change point was selected a priori based on the assumption that some changes in the vaccination coverage rates should be detected within the first month of SDG policy implementation. However, to avoid artefactual conclusions on the effects of the policy implementation, we performed sensitivity analyses in which the interruption points were shifted three months before (i.e., October, November and December 2015) and after policy implementation (i.e, February, March and April 2016). The 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Newey-West standard errors. [25]  We accounted for autocorrelation by estimating coverge rates at different time lags.The model fit was determined by the absence of autocorrelated errors with Cumby-Huizinga test. [26]  To statistically test the changes in trend of coverage rates, Mann-Kendall and Sen’s slopes [27]  were estimated. The ITS analyses were conducted using STATA software version 16.1. [28]  The spatiotemporal analyses were implemented in GeoDa software version 1.18. [29]  To assess whether the spatial distribution of measles vaccination coverage rates are changing by location (LGAs) and time (year), we first generated Choropleth maps [30]  from 2014 to 2019. In addition, yearly relative risk (RR) maps were generated using GeoDa software. The relative risk was estimated by comparing the observed coverage rate for a specified LGA to the state-level coverage (reference). At the LGA-level, a distance-based approach with a threshold of 2km was used to produce a spatial weight matrix in a geographic-coordinate shapefile of Ekiti State. To estimate spatial autocorrelation of coverage rates, we first calculated global Moran’s I index for each year. [31]  The global Moran’s I provides information on spatial clusters (positive value), spatial randomness (zero) and spatial dispersion (negative value). Thereafter, we generated local spatial autocorrelation (LISA) maps to visualize clusters of LGAs with low rates across the years (i.e., low-low clusters), consistent clusters of high values (i.e. high-high clusters) as well as spatial outliers (i.e., high-low or low-high). The high-low clusters denote LGAs with relatively higher vaccination rates that were neighbors to those with relatively lower rates, and vice versa for low-high cluster. It is important to note that reference to high or low is relative to the mean of the MCV1 coverage rates. [32]  For spatial autocorrelation, 999 Monte Carlo replications were performed. The significance level was set at p-value < 0.05.   3 Results 3.1 Temporal trend of first dose of measles vaccination coverage The annual and monthly trends of MCV1 in Ekiti State are shown in Fig. 1  . The average state-level coverage rate from 2014 to 2019 was 70.67% (standard deviation (SD): 13.17%). In 2019, coverage rate was 49%—a 35.53% decline from 76% in 2014 and a state-level gap of 46% (using 95% vaccination rate for SDG-3 as a benchmark). While the annual rates showed an increased trend between 76% in 2014 and 86% in 2017 (annual rate of change (ARC) = 4.12%), measles vaccination decreased at an annual rate of 28.12%, from 86% in 2017 to 49% in 2019. Prior to SDG policy change (January 2014 to December 2015), the monthly-aggregated data showed no statistically significant trend at a monthly rate of change of 0.37% (Mann-Kendall slope = −46, Sen’s slope = −0.26, p-trend = 0.264). However, the monthly temporal trend after the policy change (January 2016 to December 2019) showed a significant monotonic downtrend at 1.66% (Mann-Kendall slope = −493, Sen’s slope = −1.07, p-trend < 0.001). The vaccination coverage was lowest at 1.2% in June 2016 and peaked at 100% in December 2016. The monthly temporal changes in the coverage rates stratified by LGAs are presented in S1 Fig.  3.2 Spatial distribution of first dose of measles vaccination coverage The spatial distribution and relative risk of MCV1 in Ekiti State from 2014 to 2019 are shown in Figs. 2 and 3   , respectively. The mean coverage rate during 2014–2019 ranged from 84.67% (Efon) and 82.17% (Emure) to 60.83% (Gbonyin), with 9 LGAs recording rates below the national average. The areas below the national average during the study period were: Ekiti East (RR: 0.91), Ekiti West (RR: 0.98), Gbonyin (RR: 0.87), Idi-Osi (RR: 0.99), Ijero (RR: 0.93), Ikole (RR: 0.99), Irepodun (RR: 0.85), Moba (0.99) and Oye (RR: 0.85). Across the years, geographical distribution of measles vaccination varied considerably (Fig. 2 ). In 2014, no LGA attained the desired 95% universal MCV1 coverage rate, however 2 out of the 16 LGAs had at least 90% coverage (Emure and Gbonyin), while the lowest rate was recorded in Oye (51%). In 2016, the proportion of LGAs with at least 95% coverage rate increased to two (12.5%)—Ekiti East and Emure (96%). By 2019, 1 (6.25%) LGA (Efon) had reached 95% target. On the contrary, 62.5% had less than 50% of children vaccinated in 2019. As presented in Fig. 3 , Efon and Emure showed consistent patterns of higher rates than the state-level average. In 2019, vaccination coverage rates were relatively higher in Efon, Emure, Moba, Ilejemeje, Ado-Ekiti and Ise-Orun, compared to the state-level average.  3.3 Global and local spatial autocorrelations The global Moran’s I indices indicated random spatial patterns of MCV1 in 2016 (I = −0.5, p-value = 0.02). (Table 1  ) Also, significant geographical clustering was observed in 2017 (I = 0.3, p-value = 0.02). There was no significant spatial relationship in 2014, 2015, 2018 and 2019. The local spatial autocorrelation maps are displayed in Fig. 4  . The LISA cluster map for 2014 identified high-low spatial clusters in Ikole (I = −0.78, p-value < 0.001), Ilejemeje (I = −0.48, p-value = 0.03) and Irepodun/Ifelodun (I = −0.53, p-value = 0.004). The high-low clusters were formed by the LGAs with significantly higher coverage rates than the surrounding LGAs. On the other hand, Ise/Orun had lower rates than its neighbours—low-high cluster (I = −1.59, p-value = 0.001). Based on the 2016 LISA map, Ekiti South had high-low spatial clustering (I = −2.18, p-value = 0.006). In 2017, Efon (I = 0.25, p-value = 0.036), Ekiti West (I = 0.15, p-value = 0.03) and Moba (I = 0.64, p-value = 0.04) were identified as high-high clusters (i.e., hotspots). The high-high clusters were areas that reported high vaccination rates and were surrounded by areas with similarly high rates. Also, in 2017, Emure had high rate but was surrounded by LGAs with low rates (High-Low, I = −0.21, p-value = 0.047). In 2018, Ado-Ekiti (I = 0.27, p-value = 0.04) and Irepodun/Ifelodun (I = 1.39, p-value = 0.02) were cold spots (otherwise known as low-low clusters). These two LGAs had low rates and were neighbors to areas with similarly low rates. There was no significant spatial dependence in 2015 and 2019.  3.4 Changes in MCV1 before and during SDG implementation The ITS analysis shows that the baseline measles vaccination coverage rate was 74.5% in Ekiti State, ranging from 42.85% in Oye to 85.53% in Ikere before the implementation of SDG (Table 2  ). Across the LGAs, there were also different trends during implementation phase (Table 2  and Appendix S2-S4 Figs). Overall, there was no significant monthly change in coverage rates prior to January 2016 (pre-implementation slope = −0.31%; 95%CI: −0.69 to 0.08%; p-value = 0.119) but a significant increase of 24.07% (95%CI: 5.40 to 42.74%, p-value = 0.012) was observed in the first month of the implementation (short-term effect). However, the long-term effects of implementation show decreasing trend in coverage rates (post-implementation slope = −1.08%; 95%CI: −1.61 to −0.55%; p-value = 0.0001) (Fig. 5  ). Compared to the pre-implementation period, the coverage rate declined by −0.78% per month; 95%CI: −1.42 to −0.13%; p-value = 0.02 following implementation. As summarized in S1 Table, 18.8% of the LGAs (Ekiti East, Moba, and Gbonyin) had decelerated monthly vaccination rates before and after the policy change. For 10 LGAs (62.5%)—Ekiti South West, Ekiti West, Emure, Ido-Osi, Ijero, Ikere, Ikole, Ilejemeje, Irepodun/Ifelodun and Oye, the pre-SDG-implementation trends were not statistically significant, however, the post-implementation trend showed decreasing number of children being vaccinated for measles. Ise-Orun and Ado-Ekiti had statistically significant acceleration prior to January 2016 but remained relatively unchanged during the SDG implementation period. The trends for Efon were also constant before and after SDG implementation. No LGA had accelerated monthly coverage rates following SDG-implementation. From the sensitivity analyses (data not shown), significant trends in MCV1 rates were observed before SDG-implementation by shifting the interruption points within three months prior to the SDG-policy implementation (ranged from −0.45 to −0.59). Contrarily, later interruption points produced consistent results of no statistically significant pre-intervention trends, with an interruption point of January 2016. Also, the post-implementation trends showed declining rates of MCV1 across all the candidate interruption points, but there were somewhat no significant differences in pre- and post-implementation trends for earlier interruption dates.   4 Discussion This study determined the trend in measles vaccination coverage among children aged 9–15 months in Ekiti State, Southwest Nigeria between 2014 and 2019 taking into consideration the implementation of the SDG in the state. The main finding of this study is not only an initial acceleration of MCV1, but also a significant decrease in coverage rates after implementation of SDG policy in Ekiti State. Following SDG implementation, no LGA had accelerated monthly coverage rates. Also, we observed that coverage rates varied across the LGAs from 2014 to 2019. The two periods analyzed in this study reflect an evolution of two phases of implementation—the pre-SDG activities (2014–2015), characterized mainly by routine immunization programs, and the SDG phase (2016–2019) characterized by stronger transition to health systems reform and government re-dedication. The notable phases imply major changes; however, the trajectory of childhood measles immunization indicates a progressive reduction in coverage. Between 2014 and 2019, the geographical distribution of measles vaccination coverage varied considerably between the different LGAs of Ekiti State. Despite the fact that the SDG aimed for a universal vaccine coverage of ≥95% for adequate protection from vaccine preventable diseases, it has been a challenge for the individual LGAs within Ekiti State to attain this benchmark which cumulatively led to the suboptimal statewide coverage. Notably, only two LGAs—Ado Ekiti and Ise-Orun had increasing trend before SDG was implemented in 2016, but progress stagnated in the SDG era. While the exact reason for this unexpected finding is not known, there is tendency to maintain status quo in these areas because of the marginal progress observed at the end of 2015 (i.e., Millennium Development Goals era). Maintaining status quo in childhood vaccination efforts in Ado Ekiti and Ise-Orun is not enough to achieve the universal vaccine coverage by 2030. It is important to note that the declining trend in most LGAs (81.25%) after the policy change might make child-related SDGs unachievable in Ekiti State. Overall, measles coverage rate was lowest in June 2016 at 1.2%, and peaked at 100% in December 2016, which later dropped to 51.1% in November 2019 and to 35.9% in December 2019. The abysmally low coverage observed in June 2016 could be partly due to abruption of immunization programmes arising from statewide workers strike action. [33]  Previous studies have suggested that operational challenges such as vaccine shortage, long wait at health facilities, bad road networks, and intercommunity violence partly affect uptake of childhood immunization in Ekiti State. [34–35]  The low coverage rate is not peculiar to Ekiti State as the 2017 National Immunization Coverage Survey (NICS) noted a comparable rate of 42% for national measles vaccination coverage. These rates are substantially lower than the 72% observed for sub-Saharan Africa. [36]  It should be noted that suboptimal immunization coverage could result in high number of measles cases which can further stress the already fragile healthcare system. [37]  In 2019 alone, Ekiti State recorded 911 measles cases, out of which 60% were laboratory confirmed. [38]  It is terrifying to note that most of these cases were unvaccinated children. This is a strong indication that the state is yet to achieve herd immunity because of the low measles vaccination coverage. The weak health system and social drivers of vaccine hesitancy/refusal such as myths/misinformation, distrust in vaccine and government should be addressed to increase measles vaccination. Evidence from the spatiotemporal and relative risk maps suggest that inequity in measles vaccination coverage across the LGAs is an issue. We speculate that varying stages of policy implementation and over-concentration of immunization activities in some areas might explicate the observed disparities. In addressing geographical inequities in Ekiti State and some of the programmatic challenges highlighted above, the primary healthcare needs to leverage existing community-based structures as part of the preventive healthcare agenda. The preventive healthcare agenda emphasizes the community-based strategies needed to reach the vulnerable children through home visits. [15]  The competence of the extension workers and effectiveness of the strategy have not been explored in Ekiti State. Future studies on the effectiveness of community-based strategies to improve childhood vaccination uptake in Ekiti State might guide future programmes. Existing evidence suggests countries that have satisfactory health indicators invested hugely on primary healthcare and exhibited a high level of good governance. [39]  It implies therefore, that effective global and national partnerships, multi-stakeholder relationships within and beyond the health sector, including the civil society and a virile healthcare system are vital for generating diverse perspectives for the SDG implementation process. Even while good policies are available, implementation is fraught with impediments and bureaucratic bottlenecks. Concerted efforts and commitments at the political level is necessary to reduce bottlenecks and enable the implementation of programmatic best-practices. To our knowledge, this study is the first to show trend as well as demonstrate the spatial distribution of measles immunization rate in Ekiti State using ecological data, to better inform macro-level planning of child health services. In addition, we employed an autoregressive ITS (a strong quasi-experimental design) which controlled for prior trends and seasonality. A clear advantage of this methodological approach is the removal of autocorrelations which could have over-fitted the models. The ITS was able to differentiate progress in the outcome variable due to the policy change into immediate/temporary and delayed/permanent changes. The sensitivity analyses further confirmed a complete separation between the pre-and post-implementation periods as the interruption points specified on or shortly after the policy implementation were driving the observed associations. However, findings from this study should be interpreted with caution as there might be concurrent child health policies during the study period. After an extensive policy review, we could not identify any policy that could have confounded the estimates either pre or post SDG implementation. Given that population-level ecological data were analysed, the findings are representative of the study area, therefore providing an unbiased reflection of the population being studied. However, inferences should be made to only the spatial units of the analysis (i.e., state and LGAs) and not to individuals. Due to unavailability of disaggregated MCV1 rates by social determinants of child health such as child sex, maternal age, education, and socioeconomic status, our study could not examine disparity in vaccination rates by social determinants of child health. Further studies aimed at assessing the impact of child health policies on health inequities and childhood vaccination is suggested. In conclusion, our results indicate that Ekiti State has not made significant progress in vaccinating children aged 9–15 months with MCV1 after the implementation of SDG policies in 2016. With coverage levels remaining below the recommended benchmark for universal coverage for SDG, Ekiti State might face serious programmatic and economic crises if measles vaccination coverage in the state is not scaled-up. The state needs to implement more impactful immunization programs to improve the current coverage rates towards achieving the SDG by 2030.  CRediT authorship contribution statement Marcus M.
