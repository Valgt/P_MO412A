                  In 2015, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was adopted by all United Nations Member States. The indoor environment of residences affects the health of occupants regarding SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being). Meanwhile, a vast amount of energy is used to supply power to houses worldwide, which emit sufficient volumes of CO2 and affect climate change regarding SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 13 (Climate Action). A key step to delivering on these SDGs is improving the thermal insulation of houses and housing equipment performance to reduce energy consumption and protect the health of the occupants by improving the indoor environment. This study presents an evaluation method for quantifying the contribution of improving housing performance toward delivering the SDGs. The proposed approach is primarily based on the results of heat load simulations. Meanwhile, blood pressure is predicted as an indicator of health by using the interior environment obtained by the simulation. A case study was performed, and the results demonstrated the effectiveness of improving the housing performance of newly constructed houses compared to heating and retrofit. The proposed method is versatile and can be adjusted for application to alternative locations, house designs, and lifestyles.

The indoor environment of residences affects the health of occupants regarding SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being). Meanwhile, a vast amount of energy is used to supply power to houses worldwide, which emit sufficient volumes of CO2  and affect climate change regarding SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 13 (Climate Action). A key step to delivering on these SDGs is improving the thermal insulation of houses and housing equipment performance to reduce energy consumption and protect the health of the occupants by improving the indoor environment. This study presents an evaluation method for quantifying the contribution of improving housing performance toward delivering the SDGs. The proposed approach is primarily based on the results of heat load simulations. Meanwhile, blood pressure is predicted as an indicator of health by using the interior environment obtained by the simulation. A case study was performed, and the results demonstrated the effectiveness of improving the housing performance of newly constructed houses compared to heating and retrofit. The proposed method is versatile and can be adjusted for application to alternative locations, house designs, and lifestyles.

It provides a shared blueprint for the peace and prosperity of the people and the planet for the present and the future. The agenda includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030, covering a wide range of issues, such as poverty, health, education, energy, and the environment. A vast amount of energy is used to power buildings, which emit sufficient volumes of CO2  and directly affect climate change. Additionally, indoor environments can affect the health of the occupants. A method for quantitatively evaluating building performance factors related to the SDGs would aid in their successful implementation. Such studies have been conducted previously; for example, Wen et al. (Wen et al., 2020 ) evaluated the contribution of green buildings to the SDGs using green building rating tools, namely: the German Society for Sustainable Building (DGNB) and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). Furthermore, correlation between the SDGs and the criteria adopted by the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) schemes has been examined (BRE Global Limited ). Miyazaki et al. (Miyazaki et al., 2019 ) analyzed the relationship between the SDGs and the Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency (CASBEE) assessment criteria, which is an assessment tool related to residential and non-residential buildings, urban development, etc. (IBEC , Murakami et al., 2014 ). “Ensuring thermal insulation and airtightness performance” in CASBEE for the residences is an example of an assessment item; one of the five options should be chosen according to the grade of the housing performance. An example of the options is “Level 4,” which is selected if the insulation level of the target house satisfies the current standards in Japan. Alawneh et al. (Alawneh et al., 2019 ) proposed a new framework to integrate the SDGs into the assessment and management of non-residential buildings. They applied the analytic hierarchy process and relative importance index methods to develop an integrated weighting system for the assessment indicators based on the significance of the sustainability problems in Jordan and their contribution toward achieving the SDGs. Although some studies calculated the assessment scores, they were fundamentally based on qualitative evaluations. The relationship between the indoor environment and the health of the occupants is one of the most important aspects in assessing sustainability. Low indoor temperature have been shown to increase the mortality during winters in Japan (Ministry of Health ). This tendency has been observed in other countries such as England, Greece, and China (Office for National Statics , Liu et al., 2020 , Alam et al., 2016 ). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends maintaining an indoor temperature of at least 18°C during cold seasons to protect the health of the general population (WHO 2018 ). Additionally, Public Health England recommends an indoor temperature of 18°C, and states that health risk increases below 16°C (Public Health England 2014 ). They recommended a common temperature based on common references; however, 18°C can be considered as an international standard for indoor temperature during cold seasons. Although Alam et al. (Alam et al., 2016 ) modeled the relationship between energy rating of buildings and the heat-related mortality and morbidity, the relationship during the cold season has not been evaluated quantitatively. The methodology correlating the housing performance and health of the residents must be effective in the cold season as well. The effect of improving the insulation on indoor environments and health of the resident can be evaluated. Surveys conducted to investigate the relationship between indoor temperature and blood pressure and other diseases (Umishio et al., 2019 , Ishimaru et al., 2020 , Umishio et al., 2020 , Umishio et al., 2020 ) indicate that blood pressure can be predicted if the indoor temperature is simulated. Considering the above aspects, energy-efficient houses that benefit the health and comfort of the residents need to be promoted. Such houses can be realized by improving thermal insulation and housing equipment, which can resolve the social issues targeted by the SDGs; however, at present, this concept has not been valued appropriately. In this study, an evaluation method for quantifying the contribution of lifestyle and improvements in housing performance to the delivery of the SDGs is proposed. The proposed method is based primarily on the results of heat load simulations that consider the indoor environment and energy consumption of a house. A case study has been presented to demonstrate the improvements that can aid in achieving the SDGs. The simulation conditions were based on typical Japanese houses and lifestyles. Although these simulation conditions are domestic and restricted, the proposed evaluation method can be adjusted for application to other locations, building designs, and lifestyles.  2 Method 2.1 Evaluating the contribution to the SDGs 2.1.1 Outline Fig. 1   describes the indicators used to evaluate the contribution of the improvements to the SDGs. Depending on their characteristics, the SDGs were categorized into health (SDG 3), energy and environment (SDGs 6, 7, and 13), and sustainable cities (SDG 11). The economic factors associated with improvements in the housing performance were also analyzed to evaluate their feasibility. The evaluation should contain indicators associated with all the SDGs; however, it was difficult to evaluate several goals quantitatively. Heat load simulations are effective tools for calculating the indoor environment and energy consumption. Each indicator (Fig. 1 ) was evaluated based on heat load calculations, accumulations, and previous studies. For instance, blood pressure was considered as a representative indicator to evaluate low indoor temperature (SDG 3). However, many other indicators related to symptoms and diseases such as heat stroke, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disorders, and household injuries should be incorporated for future evaluations. Although Fig. 1  includes several goals, the extension of the fields is preferred. Moreover, the qualitative indicator for SDG 11 should be modified into a quantitative evaluation in the future.  2.1.2 Indicator for SDG 3: Morning systolic blood pressure Blood pressure, especially that measured in the morning, is a strong predictor for cardiovascular diseases, which is the world's leading cause of death. “A nationwide Smart Wellness Housing survey” in Japan (Umishio et al., 2019 ) reported the relationship between blood pressure and indoor temperature in winter via analysis using a multilevel model. According to the survey, morning systolic blood pressure was sensitive to changes in indoor temperature (8.2 mmHg increase/10°C decrease) in participants with a mean age of 57 years. If explanatory variables such as indoor ambient temperature, age, and sex are provided, the morning systolic blood pressure can be predicted based on the result of the previous study. Indoor ambient temperature can be calculated by heat load simulations. The timing of room temperature used for the prediction depends on the schedule of the lifestyle of the residents. Accordingly, the details of calculating blood pressure are described in 2.2.3.  2.1.3 Indicator for SDGs 6, 7, and 13: Hot water consumption, energy consumption, and CO2  emissions Primary energy consumption was calculated as the sum of the electric power and gas consumption. Electric power consumption included the electricity involved in heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting, home electric appliances, and hot water supply (an accessory of the gas water heater). The primary energy conversion factor for electricity used in this study was 9.76 MJ/kWh. Gas consumption denotes the hot water usage and was calculated using the simulation program. The total hot water consumption was calculated as the sum of the consumption for the kitchen, washroom, and bathroom. The energy required to heat water is counted as energy consumption under SDG 7. The popularization of technologies to save water might contribute to increase the water-use efficiency under SDG 6. SDG 6 has been classified into “energy and environment” in this study based on the classification in (Stockholm Resilience Center ). The CO2  emissions were calculated according to electric power and gas consumption. The CO2  emission factors for electricity and gas were 0.475 kg-CO2 /kWh and 0.0136 kg-C/MJ, respectively (Ministry of the Environment ).  2.1.4 Indicator for SDG 11: Contribution to sustainable cities Retrofitting and improving the performance of newly constructed houses are accepted methods for making cities more sustainable, i.e., SDG 11. They not only improve the quality of lives of the occupants, but also increase the value of the city by forming social capital as high-quality real estate.  2.1.5 Cost for utility bills and improving housing performance Utility bills could be used to evaluate the effect of improving insulation and equipment performance. We calculated them according to the real prices for mainstream plans available in Tokyo (Appendix A). The cost for improving housing performance was used to evaluate the feasibility of the improvements (Appendix B). The costs of retrofitting, improving the thermal performance of new constructions, and improving the performance of housing equipment were calculated.   2.2 Case study The case study was designed to quantify the effects of improved housing performance and lifestyle with respect to accomplishing the SDGs. 2.2.1 Simulation methodology Calculations were performed using the Building Energy Simulation Tool (BEST) program, which calculates the room environment and heat load via the response factor method, along with calculating the energy consumption of the building (Murakami et al., 2007 , Kohri et al., 2010 ). The accuracy of the program was verified by the building energy simulation test, Building Energy Simulation Test (BESTEST) (Judkoff and Neymark, 1995 , Hirabayashi et al., 2008 ). The BEST Program for Housing Calculation (BEST-H) was used in this study.  2.2.2 Conditions of the case study Table 1   lists the simulation conditions. This study uses weather data for Tokyo, Japan (Akasaka et al., 2000 ). Fig. C.1  illustrates the monthly aggregate of weather data. Fig. 2   illustrates the standard model house based on (IBEC 2009 ) that was used in the case study. The schedule was set according to (IBEC 2009 ), which reflects a typical lifestyle of a four-person family in Japan and includes heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting, home electric appliances, hot water consumption, and occupants. The calculations performed for the case study were expressed in terms of thermal insulation, housing equipment performances, and the heating schedule. Table 2   summarizes the parameters used for the case study. Existing houses that do not satisfy the current standards of thermal insulation were described as “previous standard,” while newly built houses were regarded as “current standard” and “high-performance,” with the latter being defined according to the standard in Germany (Verordnung über energiesparenden Wärmeschutz und energiesparende Anlagentechnik bei Gebäuden ). The improvement of existing “previous standard” houses was denoted as “retrofit.” Table C.1  describes the assumptions made with regard to the housing performance standards. Area-weighted average overall heat transfer coefficients of the previous standard, current standard, and high-performance are 1.5, 0.79, and 0.38 W/(m2 ·K), respectively. The performance of housing equipment is denoted as either “reference” or “high-performance” (details in Table C.2 ). In terms of the heating schedule, “reference” is based on (IBEC 2009 ). This schedule reflects a typical lifestyle in Japan, where the daily living room operation hours were assigned as 14 h on weekdays and 13 h on weekends (including holidays). The operational hours of child's room 1 were 3 h on weekdays and 10 h on weekends; for child's room 2, they were 3 h on weekdays and 7 h on weekends. As for “bedtime heating,” additional heating periods were observed during bedtime in the bedroom and child's rooms to ensure a temperature of 18°C to prevent high blood pressure in the morning. The additional operation hours were 7-8 h on weekdays and 9 h on weekends. The improvement-related effects were indicated by comparing two cases (Table 3  ). Three proposals for improvements were evaluated in this study. Proposal 1 involved additional bedtime heating in the bedroom and child's rooms to prevent high blood pressure in the morning. Proposal 2 involved thermal insulation retrofitting. Proposal 3 represented the improved performance of a newly constructed house.  2.2.3 Calculation method for morning systolic blood pressure The indoor temperature for a representative day was obtained via heat load calculations and was used to predict the morning systolic blood pressure. The representative day was a cold day, for which blood pressure tends to be higher. Considering the minimum outdoor temperature in the morning (5-7 a.m.), the representative weekday was chosen as a day corresponding to 5 % of the heating design temperature in winter (from December to February), which was based on the concept of the design temperature for heat load calculations. The representative day was 13th  January of the typical year, which corresponded to a minimum outside air temperature of 1.1°C. The morning blood pressure in (Umishio et al., 2019 ) was measured within 1 h after waking up. Assuming that participants turn on a heating appliance after they wake up, the indoor temperature at the time of measurement might be an intermediate temperature observed between the period when the heating appliance was turned on and 1 h later. The temperature used to predict blood pressure was taken as the average of the operative temperature when the living room was initially heated (6 a.m.) and that observed 1 hour after (7 a.m.). Ambient indoor temperature (air temperature) was used in the analysis in (Umishio et al., 2019 ); however, the temperature used to predict blood pressure in this study is the operative temperature which accounts for the surface temperatures of walls. Similarly, the outside air temperature used for the prediction was the average of the temperatures at 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. The resident characteristics were defined based on an ordinary male survey participant (Umishio et al., 2019 ). As such, the resident is assumed to be a non-smoker and not use antihypertensive drugs.    3 Results and discussion 3.1 Evaluating contributions to each goal 3.1.1 Health (SDG 3) Fig. 3   shows the results for the morning systolic blood pressure, and the operative temperatures that were used to predict it. Although the blood pressure of a 46-year-old man was used in the evaluation, Fig. 3  includes results corresponding to multiple ages for reference. According to the definition of the WHO, persons aged between 65 and 74 are regarded as early-stage elderly, while persons aged 75 years and above are late-stage elderly. In Japan, it is mandatory for persons aged 40 years and above to have long-term care insurance. The predicted blood pressure is high for elderly people, with the value of approximately 135 mmHg for 65-year-olds roughly matching the criteria for high blood pressure (The Japanese Society of Hypertension ). As the thermal insulation improves, the operative temperature of the living room rises, which lowers the predicted blood pressure. As for the blood pressure predictions for a 46-year-old, the blood pressure of the retrofit case was 1.4 mmHg lower than that for the previous standard, while it was 1.3 mmHg lower than that for the current standard in the high-performance case. The operative temperature of the bedroom increased due to heating during bedtime, resulting in a lower predicted blood pressure for the bedtime than that for the reference heating schedule.  3.1.2 Energy and environment (SDGs 6, 7, and 13) To confirm the results calculated by the simulation program, the comparative case of Proposal 3 in Table 3  was compared to the energy performance calculation program based on the Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential Buildings (Building Research Institute ). The former yielded a primary energy consumption of 73.7 GJ/year, while a value of 76.5 GJ/year was obtained for the latter. This indicates that the result of the case study is appropriate to a certain extent. Fig. 4   shows the primary energy consumption and hot water consumption results. In terms of the respective thermal insulation levels for the retrofit and new constructions, the energy consumed in heating the house was small compared to the previous standard case. Additional heating at bedtime increased the heating-related energy consumption. High-performance equipment reduces the energy consumed by hot water and lighting systems. Water-saving faucets reduce hot water consumption. The reductions in CO2  emissions were correlated to the reductions in primary energy consumption.  3.1.3 Cost for utility bills Fig. 5   presents the results of the economic analysis with regard to the energy and water charges based on the amount of hot water consumption. Note that the amount of hot water used to calculate the water charge excluded the cold water consumption in the restroom and other rooms. The energy costs reflect the tendencies shown in Fig. 4 ; i.e., improving thermal insulation reduces the electricity charges, while the performance improvements of the water faucets and gas water heater reduce the gas charges. The installation of water-saving faucets also reduces the water charges.   3.2 Evaluating contributions of proposals to the SDGs In this section, influences of lifestyle and housing performance are discussed based on the results described in 3.1. They are evaluated from multiple perspectives using the indicators in Fig. 1 . Figs. 6-8   illustrate the evaluation of the proposals outlined in Table 3  for different examples. The horizontal direction corresponds to the SDGs, and the vertical direction describes the evaluation process. To begin, calculation results, such as room operative temperature and energy consumption, were indicated in terms of the comparative and target cases for evaluation. Next, the calculated results were evaluated from the viewpoint of each goal. If black characters are in a white box with a black frame, the proposal contributes to the corresponding goal. White characters in a black box indicate that the proposal is detrimental to achieving the goal. Lastly, the utility bills and the cost of improving the performance of the house are indicated. White characters in a black box indicate a cost increase, whereas black characters in a white box indicate a cost reduction. 3.2.1 Proposal 1: Bedtime heating Fig. 6  illustrates the evaluation of bedtime heating. In general, the box under SDG 3 is white, and this proposal may have positive impacts on the health of the residents. However, the boxes representing energy and environment are black, signifying that additional heating may negatively impact the environment. Bedtime heating at 18°C decreases blood pressure by 1.1 mmHg. The target reduction according to Health Japan 21 (Ministry of Health 2012 ), a policy established for health promotion in Japan, is a 4 mmHg decrease in the average systolic blood pressure; this reduction is estimated to lead to a corresponding decrease of approximately 14,000 deaths a year due to cardiovascular diseases in Japan. Bedtime heating can deliver more than 25 % of this target. In terms of the impact on the environment, energy consumption and CO2  emissions are projected to increase by 5 % (increase by 3.8 GJ/year and 0.2 t-CO2 /year, respectively) following this proposal. Although the additional heating increases electricity charges, no initial cost is expected to be incurred. If the main focus is reducing the health risks associated with low indoor temperatures, the heating measures outlined in this proposal are effective. However, the projected damage to the environment renders this proposal unsuitable as a long-term policy.  3.2.2 Proposal 2: Retrofit Fig. 7   illustrates the evaluation of the performance improvement by thermal insulation retrofitting. Most boxes are white with black characters, suggesting that this proposal may positively impact many goals. Only the box in the rightmost column of the bottom row is black, which indicates that the cost to achieve the performance improvement incurs. In terms of the resident health, improving the thermal performance results in a blood pressure decrease of 1.4 mmHg. This proposal can deliver 35 % of the target reduction (4 mmHg) (Ministry of Health 2012 ). In terms of the impact on the environment, energy consumption and CO2  emissions are decreased by 7 % (decrease by 5.4 GJ/year and 0.3 t-CO2 /year, respectively). Moreover, improving thermal insulation reduces electricity costs. However, the initial cost of retrofitting houses is considerably greater than the effect on utility bills, to the extent where investment recovery is unrealistic. Improvements to the indoor environment should be incorporated into the cost evaluation in the future to effectively estimate the effectiveness of retrofitting. Improving the indoor environment benefits the health of the residents, and can significantly reduce the health care expenditure and the economic loss caused by sick leaves.  3.2.3 Proposal 3: Performance improvement of newly constructed houses Fig. 8   illustrates the evaluation of the performance improvement of newly constructed houses. This proposal shows the potential of this performance improvement for benefitting many SDGs, which exceed that of retrofitting. Although substantial investment is required in construction and performance improvement, the improvement cost of this proposal is less than that required for retrofitting. In terms of resident health, improving the thermal insulation reduces the blood pressure by 1.3 mmHg and makes a significant contribution to reaching the target (Ministry of Health 2012 ). From an environmental perspective, improving the performance of new constructions reduces the energy consumption and CO2  emissions by 25 % (decrease by 18.6 GJ/year and 0.9 t-CO2 /year, respectively), which is substantially greater than that achieved by retrofitting because this proposal includes improving the performance of housing equipment. Installing a renewable energy system, such as solar panels, is necessary to achieve zero carbon emissions. The amount of energy consumption affects the power generation capacity, and saving energy by improving the housing performance makes it easier to achieve zero emissions. The installation of water-saving faucets reduces hot water consumption by 12 %, thereby indirectly contributing to Goal 6. With respect to economic efficiency, the performance improvements are realized at a lower cost than retrofitting, which translates to a greater reduction in utility bills. Nevertheless, the time required to recover the initial investment via utility bills alone is so long that complete recoupment is not realistic. As with retrofitting, future evaluations should consider the effects of improving the indoor environment on reducing health care expenditure via improved resident health.   3.3 Discussion and limitations of the study The existing methods related to the assessment tools proposed in previous studies (Wen et al., 2020 , Alawneh et al., 2019 ) encapsulate a wide range of SDGs and evaluate many indicators as compared to the method proposed in this study. They consider the weight of each indicator; one of their advantages is to enable comparison of the contribution to SDGs, while considering the priority of goals. The greater the number of achieved assessment items, the better the evaluation. There might be a correlation between the number of achieved items and contribution toward delivering the SDGs; however, existing methods do not indicate the degree of contribution. The method proposed in this study evaluated fewer goals but quantitatively indicated them. This is important under the circumstance of improving many houses to deliver the SDGs. For instance, the target reduction in average systolic blood pressure in Japan is 4 mmHg (Ministry of Health 2012 ). The proposed method clarifies the impact of improvement on this target. It enables a quantitative discussion on how many houses should be improved compared to other solutions, such as lifestyle improvements. Existing methods cannot deliver such a discussion and this is the reason why quantitative evaluation is essential. Moreover, mutual complementation of existing methods and the proposed one might enable quantitative evaluation in a wide range of SDGs. One of the goals is establishing quantitative evaluation considering the weight of each indicator which enables comparison of strategies based on the contribution to the entire SDGs. Strategies for achieving the SDGs are evaluated by the results of the case study. With respect to bedtime heating, blood pressure is decreased by 1.1 mmHg; however, energy consumption and CO2  emissions are projected to increase by 5 %. In terms of thermal insulation retrofitting, improving the thermal performance results in a blood pressure decrease of 1.4 mmHg, and energy consumption and CO2  emissions are decreased by 7 %. However, the initial cost of retrofitting houses is considerably high. The performance improvement of newly constructed houses (area-weighted average overall heat transfer coefficients from 0.79 W/(m2 ·K) to 0.38 W/(m2 ·K) and housing equipment from conventional type to high-performance type) reduces the blood pressure by 1.3 mmHg and the energy consumption and CO2  emissions by 25 %. With respect to economic efficiency, the performance improvements are realized at a lower cost than retrofitting. Consequently, although heating is effective in decreasing blood pressure, energy consumption and CO2  emissions are increased. In contrast, improvements that make houses thermally insulated and more energy-efficient tend to benefit both resident health and the environment and thus should be adopted as the optimum strategy. One of the limitations of the study is that limited indicators were evaluated by the proposed method. For instance, blood pressure is treated as a representative indicator under SDG 3. Although the increase in mortality during cold season is observed even in low latitude areas such as Hong Kong (Liu et al., 2020 ), it is an indicator related only to cold climate. Many other indicators related to symptoms and diseases such as heat stroke and household injuries should be incorporated for future evaluation. Additionally, health care expenditure and the economic loss caused by sick leave could be effective indicators in the economic evaluation. Moreover, the extension of fields to the entire SDGs and the modification to quantitative evaluations are preferred in the future. Although the simulation conditions used for evaluation in this study were domestic and restricted, the evaluation method is adaptable and can be adjusted for application to other locations, building designs, and lifestyles.   4 Conclusions We proposed a heat load simulation-based method for quantitatively evaluating the contribution of improved resident lifestyle and housing performance to the SDGs. The main targets of the proposed evaluation method were resident health (considered in terms of blood pressure), energy consumption, and CO2  emissions. As a case study, the simulation conditions were selected to reflect typical Japanese houses and lifestyles. The case study confirmed the effectiveness of improving housing performance. For instance, improving area-weighted average overall heat transfer coefficients from 0.79 W/(m2 ·K) to 0.38 W/(m2 ·K) and improving housing equipment from conventional type to high-performance type were assumed. The improvement led to a blood pressure reduction of 1.3 mmHg. It also reduced energy consumption and CO2  emissions by 25 %. There are two main approaches for improving housing performance: building a high-quality house and retrofitting an existing one. With respect to economic efficiency, the improvement of a newly constructed house is realized at a lower cost than retrofitting. Quantitative evaluation allowed housebuilders and occupants to select more effective strategies for achieving SDGs by comparing between improving housing performance and utilization of equipment, which could further expand quantitative evaluation in the study on buildings. Moreover, quantitative evaluation enables comparison of the impact of improving housing performance with other approaches. It is an important point under the circumstances where many approaches are required to be considered to achieve the SDGs. The proposed method helps decision making on concrete actions and thus delivering them. Furthermore, mutual complementation of the proposed and existing methods, which cover a wide range of SDGs and evaluate many indicators, might enable quantitative evaluation considering a wide range. Future studies should seek to incorporate additional quantitative indicators. For instance, health care expenditure and economic loss caused by sick leave could be effective indicators for the economic evaluation. The economic effect of reduced blood pressure and improving other diseases should be compared against the costs associated with heating and improving the thermal performance of houses. Finally, although the present case study is limited to domestic conditions, the proposed evaluation method has the possibility to be adapted to other locations, building designs, and lifestyles.

Funding organizations had no role in simulation, analysis, and interpretation of the data; preparation of the article; or the decision to submit the article for publication.  Appendix A Details of calculating costs for utility bills Utility bills, electricity, gas, and water charges were calculated based on real prices for mainstream plans available in Tokyo, with the aim of evaluating the effect of improving insulation and equipment performance. Electricity charges were calculated according to the “Standard S Plan” (50A) provided by Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings as of November 2019 (Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings ). The demand charge was 1,430 JPY/month. Energy charges for the first stage (≤120 kWh), second stage (120-300 kWh), and third stage (>300 kWh) were 19.88, 26.46, and 30.57 JPY/kWh, respectively. Gas charges were calculated based on the “general contract” provided by Tokyo Gas as of August 2020 (Tokyo Gas ). Gas consumption of 0-20 m3 /month corresponds to a basic rate of 759 JPY/month and a unit rate of 145.31 JPY/m3 . For gas consumption of 20-80 m3 /month, the basic rate is 1,056 JPY/month and unit rate is 130.46 JPY/m3 . Water charges were calculated according to the amount of hot water consumption and the water and sewage service charges for the Bureau of Waterworks Tokyo Metropolitan Government as of August 2020 (Tokyo Metropolitan Government ). The service charge was 1,170 JPY/month. Water commodity charges were broken down into first stage (1-5 m3 ), second stage (6-10 m3 ), and third stage (11-20 m3 ), corresponding to charges of 0 JPY, 22 JPY/m3 , and 128 JPY/m3 , respectively. Similarly, the sewage commodity charges for the first (1-8 m3 ) and second (9-20 m3 ) stages were 560 JPY and 110 JPY/m3 , respectively.  Appendix B Details of calculating costs for improving housing performance The costs involved for retrofitting ceilings, exterior walls, and floors were calculated using the approach described in (Research Committee of Smart Wellness House 2017 ), which is based on the unit prices in a technical paper on energy retrofitting (NILIM 2010 ). The unit prices for exterior wall lining, floor-filling, ceiling blown-in insulations, underfloor air sealing, and attic air sealing were 7,100 JPY/m2 , 12,000 JPY/m2 , 4,300 JPY/m2 , 900 JPY/m, and 1,300 JPY/m, respectively. Note that although the chosen specifications are similar to those listed in Table 2 , they do not necessarily satisfy the specifications because of the limited information. The costs for windows and doors are based on market prices (LIXIL ). We assumed that an inner window was installed on the interior side of the existing windows. To evaluate the costs involved for improving the thermal performance of new constructions, a newly built house was assumed to satisfy the current standard of thermal insulation in Japan. The improvement cost was calculated as the difference in cost required for improving the thermal performance and that required for achieving the current standard. The unit prices for thermally insulating the ceilings, exterior walls, and floors were based on (Kenchioku Kouzi Kenkyu-kai 2019 ). With respect to the “current standard” (Table 2 ), fiberglass was used as the thermal insulation material, with the unit prices being adjusted according to the thickness of insulation required for the ceilings, exterior walls, and floors (1,760, 970, and 1,030 JPY/m2 , respectively). As for the “high-performance” grade (Table 2 ), high-performance fiberglass and phenolic foam were used for insulation, and the adjusted unit prices for ceilings, walls, and floors were 3,060, 3,360, and 2,710 JPY/m2 , respectively. The costs for windows were based on (Kenchiku Shiryo Kenkyuusya 2018 ). For instance, the unit prices for a window (width: approximately 1.7 m, height: 2.1 m) meeting the “current standard” and “high-performance” grades were approximately 57,000 and 109,000 JPY, respectively. Note that the specifications used when sourcing the costs were chosen to be similar to those listed in Table 2 ; however, they neither necessarily satisfy these specifications nor the assumed size owing to the limited availability of information. To implement ventilation performance improvements, the cost of total heat exchangers was considered based on the suggested retail prices: the unit prices for 15, 30, and 50 m3 /h were approximately 170,000, 180,000, and 190,000 JPY, respectively (Nihon Stiebel ). The costs involved in improving the performance of housing equipment were calculated as the difference from those of reference performance based on the suggested retail or market price. The costs of water faucets, a gas water heater, air conditioners, and lighting were considered. For instance, conventional and latent heat recovery gas water heaters exhibit retail prices of 347,000 and 386,000 JPY, respectively (NORITZ ).
