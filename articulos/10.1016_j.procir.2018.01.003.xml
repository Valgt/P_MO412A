                  Environmental degradation and social tensions have put societies under severe pressures the past couple of decades to such a degree that a historic global political agreement was made in September 2015, when 193 countries signed the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for 2030, the so-called SDGs or “Global Goals”. The SDGs, and their sub targets, represent a crystal ball for business to “look into the future” and seek long term guidance for investments and new business opportunities. Novozymes, the world's largest manufacturer of enzymes and microbes for industry, has been a frontrunner in sustainability and to our knowledge the first company in the world to align its company purpose, strategy and long term targets with the SDG's. Novozymes is now in the process of evaluating and prioritizing its innovation pipeline by potential SDG impact and sourcing new partners for SDG impact. With the SDGs in place, business now have a much clearer set of long term global priorities with political tail wind, and the alignment between policy makers, civil society and the private sector is much stronger. The SDGs are a great gift to business!

Development of The United Nations Sustainable  Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030  Environmental degradation and social tensions has put  societies under severe pressures the past couple of decades,  with the growing populations and increasing per capita  consumption as the key drivers. Pressures, that in September  2015, led to a historic global political agreement, when 193  countries signed the United Nations Sustainable Development  Goals for 2030, the so-called SDGs or â€œGlobal Goalsâ€�.[1]    Already back in year 2000 an agreement for global  development was landed when the UN member states agreed  to the so-called Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  aimed at driving the global development agenda in the time  period 2000-2015. The MDGs targeted eight key areas:  poverty, education, gender equality, child mortality, maternal  health, disease, the environment and global partnership. Each  goal was supported by 21 specific targets and more than 60  indicators to monitor.       Fig 1. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  Â© 201  The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license  (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). Peer-review under responsibility of the scientiï¬� c committee of the 25th CIRP Life Cycle Engineering (LCE) Conference  22   Claus Stig Pedersen /  Procedia CIRP  69 ( 2018 )  21 â€“ 24  The MDGÂ´s came out of a typical political UN process  with limited interactions outside UN and government circles.  The outcome of the process, the MDGÂ´s, primarily had appeal  in the political and regulatory system, as well as to aid- and  civil society organizations. The private sector in general did  not see its role in relation to the MDGs.  In many aspects MDGs were successful and became  recognized as the most successful global anti-poverty push in  history. Governments, international organizations, and civil  society groups around the world helped reduce the worldâ€™s  extreme poverty rate by more than 50%. Today, much more  girls are in school and much fewer children are dying from  disease and malnutrition thanks to the focus and actions  driven by the MDGs.[2]  However, despite the success of the MDGÂ´s, already  midway to 2015, it became increasingly clear that the MDGÂ´s  were not going to solve all major global challenges. Many  new and severe societal challenges surfaced in those years and  called for global action with a much wider scope. Among the  new challenges, that were generally recognized as material,  were the many different environmental and social issues  related to the fast growing industrial production, consumption  and urbanization.   With its focus on poverty, education and diseases the  MDGÂ´s were primarily driving a political agenda for the  developing world. However, with the many new sustainability  issues materializing it became very clear that the sustainable  development agenda was as much an agenda for the  developed world, and especially also for the private sector.  When the revenues of large companies exceed the GDP of  many countries, and supply chains stretch around the world,  the private sector plays a key role in achieving a global  sustainable development â€“ environmentally and socially.   The private sector defines to a large degree the social and  environmental performance levels through the entire value  chains in which they operate, from production to consumption  and disposal of consumer goods. It became widely  recognized, also in the UN system, that the sustainable  development agenda would only be successful with  significant engagement and contributions coming from the  private sector.   The SDG development process was formally kicked off at  the RIO+20 UN Earth Summit, in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil  2012. The intent was to create a new set of global goals to  address the growing challenges to a sustainable development,  and to continue the journey started with the MDGs.   From the beginning of the process the private sector was  invited to contribute via a so called Open Working Group  (OWG) established early 2013 to coordinate the interactions  between the UN system, civil society and business [3]. This  opening of a major UN process to the private sector  represented a significant paradigm shift in the way UN  operates.   2. Business and the SDGÂ´s  In general, businesses succeed when they can meet  peopleâ€™s needs with solutions that people want, and when a  rewarding business model can be established around that  interaction. In general business ask policy makers for clear  and robust long term policy frameworks, in which they can  operate and which they can use to guide investments, target  innovation and support business development decisions. The  new open UN SDG process initiated in 2012 thus motivated  many businesses to engage. The private sector in general  hoped to be able to inform, inspire and influence the process  to deliver an outcome with much more private sector  relevance and appeal compared to the MDGs.   The private sector hoped that the SDG development  process would deliver the desired long term political  framework that effectively could enable more private sector  contributions to a global sustainable development, which were  in better sync with societal needs and long term priorities, and  therefore which could help secure the long term license to  operate and success of the business.  From 2013, where the OWG was formally established, to  2015 many representatives from the private sector, including  the major business organizations, provided their inputs to the  SDG development process.   With the signing of the SDGÂ´s in September 2015 the  private sector in many ways got the gift it had asked for. The  17 SDGÂ´s, the 169 specific targets and the thousands of  indicators represent a long term political framework for  business to contribute to sustainable development. They  outline exactly that long-term guideline for what will be  needed, accepted and supported by societies in the coming  decades and therefore, consequently, what will be demanded  by the markets long term. As such they offer a crystal ball for  business to â€œlook into the futureâ€� and seek guidance for  investments and new business opportunities and they  represent a new tool box for innovation and market  development. To other companies, who may be in the  business of â€œSDG unfitâ€� solutions, the SDGs provide similar  guidance to reduce risk and costs, and in some cases perhaps  to transform the company and change its business models into  more sustainable versions.  However, from high level political agreements, like the  SDGs, to real and short term market impact is a long distance.  A distance which may be overwhelming for many short term  focused businesses who may be unfamiliar with the processes  of collaborating with the UN and policy makers.   Progress is certainly being made at the political levels.  Since the signing of the goals in September 2015 the 193  individual UN Member States have all begun to develop and  implement SDG plans at national level. In July 2016, the first  22 countries volunteered to present their plans1. In July 2017,  44 more countries2, presented their plans and the rest of the  UN Member States are due to follow each year until 2020.  The SDG implementation plans are set to guide and drive  country specific focus areas, policies, regulations, financing,  stimulus programs, awareness campaigns and many other  activities aimed at delivering to the achievement of the SDGs  at national level. Progress reporting and review of the national  plans is set to take place at the UN over 5 year cycles.      1  China, Colombia, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany,  Madagascar, Mexico, Montenegro, Morocco, Norway, Philippines, Korea,  Samoa, Sierra Leone, Switzerland, Togo, Turkey, Uganda, Venezuela.  2 Afghanistan, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Belize,  Benin, Botswana, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Cyprus, Czech Republic,  Denmark, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Indonesia,  Iran, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Maldives, Monaco,  Nepal, Netherlands, Nigeria, Panama, Peru, Portugal, Qatar, Slovenia,  Sweden, Tajikistan, Thailand, Togo, Uruguay, Zimbabwe.  23 Claus Stig Pedersen /  Procedia CIRP  69 ( 2018 )  21 â€“ 24    Fig 2. Novozymesâ€™ strategic journey to SDG alignment    The SDGÂ´s are a gift to business because the economic  rewards for delivering to the needs defined in the SDGÂ´s are  very significant. According to the Business &amp; Sustainable  Development Commission the potential economic reward  from delivering solutions to the SDGs could be worth at least  $12 trillion each year in market opportunities and generate up  to 380 million new jobs by 2030 [4].  The business of the SDGs will not materialize from a CSR  strategy disconnected from the business core. Going for the  business of the SDGs will require that business leader weave  the SDGs into their long-term business strategies and renew  their thinking about stakeholder engagements and how the  business is created. Collaboration and Public Private  Partnerships (PPPs) will be keys to success for business and  for governments in the coming decades.  3. Novozymesâ€™ strategic journey to SDG alignment  Novozymes is a biotechnology company and the worldâ€™s  largest manufacturer of biological solutions for industry.  Novozymes produces a wide range of industrial enzymes and  microorganisms applied in more than 30 different industries  ranging from textile, leather, pulp &amp; paper, laundry to food,  feed and agriculture.   Novozymesâ€™ biological solutions improve industrial  products and manufacturing processes by saving energy,  water and raw materials, while reducing chemical use, waste  generation and emissions.   Being a responsible company, operating with respect for  the environment, people and society has been part of  Novozymesâ€™ DNA throughout the companyâ€™s history and the  company has benefitted from its sustainability leadership in  many ways. These include employee motivation, attraction  and retention, customer and investor recognitions, goodwill  from policy makers and NGOs, storytelling and branding.  Novozymes was formed as an independent company by a  demerger from the pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk in  2000 and has since then had three business strategy periods,  where sustainability has been used in three different ways as  illustrated in Figure 2.  In Novozymesâ€™ first business strategy period (2000-2008),  sustainability activities were primarily focused on controlling  operational and supply chain risks, reducing costs, increasing  transparency and reporting. Sustainability leadership  recognitions in those years primarily came from making  award-winning integrated reports on financial, environmental  and social performance.  In the second business strategy period (2009-2014),  Novozymesâ€™ sustainability focus shifted from supply chain  and operations to products and customers. Product life cycle  assessments (LCAs) were conducted in collaboration with  customers to document the sustainability benefits generated  by Novozymes solutions - which customers could use in their  marketing activities. LCAs also formed the basis for corporate  storytelling and communication about the potential of  Novozymesâ€™ technologies and for dialogues with investors,  policy makers and NGOs. Sustainability leadership  recognitions came from the ability to integrate the  sustainability-related value proposition within different  business functions, and support them in their efforts to add  value to customers and other key stakeholders.  In the third business strategy period (2015-2020), where  Novozymesâ€™ current Purpose was launched, business and  sustainability ambitions effectively merged and became one at  the highest level. The opportunity and challenge within this  strategy period is to bring sustainability insights into the  process of setting priorities for innovation and business  development, and thereby use sustainability insights to set  24   Claus Stig Pedersen /  Procedia CIRP  69 ( 2018 )  21 â€“ 24  direction for the business, as opposed to just following and  supporting the business.   Succeeding with this strategy will require a much stronger  inclusion of sustainability perspectives in business strategy  development &amp; execution, as well as in innovation portfolio  &amp; pipeline management, and finally a much stronger  integration of the Sustainability and Public Affairs work, as  the SDG agenda increasingly drives business, sustainability  and policy interest of Novozymes closer together.   The role of sustainability is continually intensifying and  Novozymes will continue to work with all the sustainability  aspects and value drivers mentioned in the three steps above.  Going forward, Novozymes believe that sustainability  leadership credits will come from the scale of the positive  impact on the world you can generate with your business. In  that context the SDGÂ´s are extremely helpful.  Novozymes has been engaged in the SDG process since its  very beginning at the UN Earth Summit (Rio+20) in 2012.  Novozymesâ€™ engagement has primarily been via memberships  of the UN Global Compact (UNGC) [5], The International  Chamber of Commerce (ICC) [6] and the World Business  Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) [7]. Through  these organizations, Novozymes has actively taken part in  advocating for an SDG framework that was relevant to, and  present a prominent role for, business. Already in 2014  Novozymes used the draft SDGs as inspiration when  developing its new Purpose, Strategy and Long Term targets  for the third strategy period.  To make the SDGs a relevant tool to support business  decision making, Novozymes needed to be able to qualify and  quantify potential contributions to the SDGÂ´s stemming from  its core business activities and technologies. Novozymes has  therefore developed an SDG assessment and management tool  to guide those processes. The tool has already been used to  scan the pipeline of innovation opportunities and to identify  the most potent future contributors to the SDGs.       Fig 3: Illustration of Novozymes SDG assessment process    Novozymes believes, given the many stakeholders  supporting the SDG agenda and the general desire to see SDG  solutions in the market at speed and at scale, that it will be  possible to form partnerships with non-business stakeholders  with capacity to help accelerate the deployment of its business  solutions for the SDGÂ´s.   Currently, Novozymes is in the process of using the  potential positive SDG contributions from four commercial  projects, in animal feed, bioenergy, palm oil and water, as an  argument to attract business and non-business partners for  business development acceleration.  4. How to unfold and sustain the â€œSDG gift to businessâ€� -  step by step  The SDGÂ´s most likely represent the best long term  strategic market outlook ever put in front of business. The  distance from the high level political agreements to real  market impact may seem long, uncertain and overwhelming to  some. However, if only just half of what the SDGs suggest  will materialize by 2030, then the SDGs still represent the  best long term market guidance we have ever had before us.  Many of companies seems to share those views and have  already embraced the SDGs in many ways. That is good news  and a good start. However, to achieve the SDGs it will require  that most companies do things differently, and in many cases,  do different things.   To some companies the SDG agenda will entail increased  risks to their business, because of future regulations or bad  will from consumers caused by â€œSDG un-fitâ€� products or  business practices. To other companies the SDG agenda will  drive added costs. This is very likely for companies with  â€œSDG un-fitâ€� energy supply systems or raw material needs.  To a third group of companies, who deliver â€œSDG-fitâ€�  solutions from the core of their business, the SDGs will drive  market growth.  Many companies are still struggling getting it right and to  define their next steps to align their strategies with the SDGs  and to measure and manage their impacts.   A number of step-by-by step tools are available online for  free to support those processes â€“ for example the SDG  Compass [8], developed by the Global Reporting Initiative  (GRI), the U.N. Global Compact and the World Business  Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). Such  stepwise procedures will be relevant to any company no  matter what the SDG motives are (risk, cost, opportunity) or  what industry or geography it operates in.   And finally, the really good news is that the SDGs are not  really a new agenda. The SDG agenda is in its essence just the  â€œold sustainability agendaâ€� made easier. With the SDGÂ´s in  place we now have a much clearer set of long term global  priorities with political tail wind and we have much stronger  alignment between policy makers, civil society and the private  sector.
