                  Scarcity of water has emerged as a major problem globally due to climate change and population growth, especially in semi-arid and arid regions. Egypt is currently experiencing serious water challenges due to its limited water resources. The water challenges require optimal and sustainable water management, which should be linked to sustainable development goals. In this context, rainwater harvesting (RWH) is an efficient technique for sustainable management of water resources. This research aims to determine the optimal implementation of RWH systems considering the biophysical and socioeconomic characteristics of the study area. This research combines geographic information systems, remote sensing, multi-criteria analysis, and hydrological modeling in a case study in Wadi Watir in the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt. It then determines optimal sites for RWH structures using a combination of Boolean analysis, weighted linear combination, and depression depth technique. The study's findings are linked to the sustainable development goals to develop a sustainable RWH plan for the first time. The results indicated that 19% (666 km2) of the study area is highly suitable for RWH. The possibility of RWH is restricted to 16% (573 km2) of the watershed. The study results identified 12 optimal sites for checking dams and 14 locations for percolation tanks along the streams. This research puts forward a novel technique to address the challenges of water scarcity along with socioeconomic and environmental pressures while achieving sustainable development goals.

Therefore, it is the main factor in any RWH system (Matomela et al., 2020 ).  b Al-adamat et al. (2010)  clarified that areas with slopes >5% are not recommended for RWH owing to the unequal spread of runoff and the massive amount of required earthwork that is high in cost.  c The basin area has a significant impact on the runoff processes. Therefore, it is an essential parameter in estimating the RWH potential. Increasing the basin area increases the amount of rain collected and the peak flood discharge (Pitlick, 1994 ).  d Maximum flow distance is an important factor in determining RWH potentiality, and higher maximum flow distance values are associated with higher RWH potential (Elewa et al., 2021 ).  e Higher TWI values show a large contribution area combined with a low slope, indicating a higher potential for water concentration and vice versa (Berhanu and Bisrat, 2018 ).  f Streams are the main source of surface water in the wadies. Drainage density is a function of stream orders. Adham et al. (2018)  stated that increasing the drainage density decreases infiltration and permeability.  g Lineament frequency density analysis is necessary for identifying RWH sites because joints and fractures raise the soil infiltration rate. Therefore, increasing the lineament frequency density decreases the RWH potential (Sayl et al., 2019 ).  h Krois and Schulte (2014)  discussed that land use is among the main factors affecting the runoff and RWH suitability. RWH is restricted in built-up and agriculture areas for safety reasons and economic considerations, respectively (Matomela et al., 2020 ).  i The local community is at risk of flooding when the RWH is near built-up areas. Accessibility will also be a challenge if the RWH is too far from the built-up areas. As a result, a moderate distance is preferred (Al-adamat et al., 2010 ).  j Roads have high socio-economic importance for the local community in any region. Residents can drive their trucks and tankers from one position to another on these roads while moving their livestock, in search for water and herb (Al-adamat et al., 2010 ).

The fault area should be eliminated from the RWH site selection process (Al-adamat et al., 2010 ).  c Roads were excluded to avoid any potential conflicts between road expansion and RWH structures (Matomela et al., 2020 ).

Egypt is currently experiencing serious water challenges due to its limited water resources. The water challenges require optimal and sustainable water management, which should be linked to sustainable development goals. In this context, rainwater harvesting (RWH) is an efficient technique for sustainable management of water resources. This research aims to determine the optimal implementation of RWH systems considering the biophysical and socioeconomic characteristics of the study area. This research combines geographic information systems, remote sensing, multi-criteria analysis, and hydrological modeling in a case study in Wadi Watir in the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt. It then determines optimal sites for RWH structures using a combination of Boolean analysis, weighted linear combination, and depression depth technique. The study's findings are linked to the sustainable development goals to develop a sustainable RWH plan for the first time. The results indicated that 19% (666 km2 ) of the study area is highly suitable for RWH. The possibility of RWH is restricted to 16% (573 km2 ) of the watershed. The study results identified 12 optimal sites for checking dams and 14 locations for percolation tanks along the streams. This research puts forward a novel technique to address the challenges of water scarcity along with socioeconomic and environmental pressures while achieving sustainable development goals.   Graphical abstract Image 1       Keywords Arid region  Boolean analysis  Multi-criteria analysis  Remote sensing  Sustainable development goals  Wadi Watir    1 Introduction According to the fifth report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 80% of the Earth's population is facing water scarcity (Elhassnaoui et al., 2021 ). Moreover, by 2025, 1.8 billion people worldwide are expected to live in areas of extreme water scarcity (Wu et al., 2018 ; Yannopoulos et al., 2019 ). Water scarcity has exacerbated into a severe global problem due to population growth and climate change, especially in semi-arid and arid regions, where precipitation highly fluctuates (Matomela et al., 2020 ). Mostafa (2020)  demonstrated that many countries, especially those in the Middle East and North Africa, are on the verge of an impending water crisis. Egypt is a Middle Eastern country classified as highly arid. The country is threatened by a severe water shortage crisis. Given that the water per capita in Egypt, is expected to reach 536 m3 /year by 2025, the master plan in Egypt now is to make the optimal use of unusual water resources such as rainwater harvesting (RWH). Freshwater is a precious natural resource for the survival and growth of all living things on the planet, as the global freshwater supply is steadily dwindling due to increased urbanization, rapid industrialization, and overexploitation of groundwater. Therefore, optimal and sustainable water resources management and efficient strategies are required at the watershed scale (Mahmoud and Alazba, 2015 ; Selvam et al., 2015 ; Tiwari et al., 2018 ). It is necessary to link sustainable strategies with sustainable development goals (SDGs) (Saqr et al., 2021 ). Velis et al. (2017)  illustrated that sustainable strategies should achieve the targets of the SDGs and meet current water requirements without jeopardizing the needs of future generations. According to the UN's 17 SDGs and their targets, there is a direct link between the sustainability of natural resources and various environmental, social, and economic performance (Mahmoud et al., 2022 ; UN, 2020 ). RWH is an effective technique for collecting freshwater, ameliorating the danger of flash flooding, and ensuring groundwater recharge worldwide (Harka et al., 2020 ; Elewa et al., 2021 ). The collected rainwater is a sustainable source of clean water, which can be utilized for different productive purposes and to supplement groundwater supplies (Tiwari et al., 2018 ). Moreover, rainfed cultivation accounts for 90% of grain production in semi-arid and arid regions (Matomela et al., 2020 ). RWH activities have long been used as a dynamic technique to support people in the face of unpredictable and variable rainfall (Bitterman et al., 2016 ). Filtration dams, dikes, and ponds are significant RWH structures for replenishing and protecting groundwater often depleted in semi-arid and arid regions (Singh et al., 2017 ). Geographic information system (GIS), and remote sensing (RS) techniques have proven to be efficient tools in many studies and have been widely used in mapping the most suitable RWH sites (Adham et al., 2018 ; Campos et al., 2018 ; Elewa et al., 2021 ; Samal et al., 2015 ; Singh et al., 2017 ). Soil conservation models have been used for estimating runoff from precipitation data in many RWH studies (Napoli et al., 2014 ; Singh et al., 2017 ; Tiwari et al., 2018 ). Furthermore, different studies have combined the soil conservation service-curve number method (SCS–CN) with multi-criteria analysis (MCA) and hydrological modeling (HM) for the identification of RWH suitability (Elewa et al., 2021 ; Jha et al., 2014 ; Krois and Schulte, 2014 ; Singh et al., 2017 ). An example of MCA is the analytical hierarchy process (AHP), which has been practiced by many studies (Jothiprakash and Sathe, 2009 ; Krois and Schulte, 2014 ). Moreover, the weighted linear combination (WLC) method has been practiced by several researchers to determine the best RWH sites (Bitterman et al., 2016 ; Jha et al., 2014 ; Omolabi and Fagbohun, 2019 ; Zende et al., 2018 ). The Boolean technique is also used for site suitability determination. This technique has limitations because it divides areas into only two categories: suitable and unsuitable (Al-adamat et al., 2010 ). Doubts remain about the best approach to select RWH locations, as the data resources provided little data on the success rate of the proposed RWH sites (Adham et al., 2016 ). The WLC method and Boolean technique combination has not been widely used (Matomela et al., 2020 ). Identifying suitable sites for RWH is an essential step towards maximizing water availability and land productivity in semi-arid and arid regions. This research aims to determine the RWH suitability of Wadi Watir in the Sinai Peninsula through a combination of GIS, RS, MCA, and HM. The integration of socioeconomic and biophysical parameters improves the efficiency of RWH site selection (Adham et al., 2016 ; Harka et al., 2020 ; Wu et al., 2018 ). This research utilizes both biophysical (e.g., runoff, basin area, slope, and land use) and socioeconomic parameters (e.g., distance to built-up areas and Bedouin communities, and distance to roads) to enhance the selection process. One of the aims of this study is to map out specific sites for RWH structures, such as percolation tanks, check dams, and farm ponds. RWH structures have a significant role in watershed management. They mitigate the risk of flash flooding, minimize soil erosion by decreasing runoff, enhance vegetation growth, improve groundwater recharge, and reduce evaporation rates (Singh et al., 2017 ). For the first time in Wadi Watir, the depression depth method (Matomela et al., 2020 ; Tiwari et al., 2018 ) is combined with the WLC and Boolean technique to determine the optimal sites for RWH structures. The novelty of the current research is that it links the study's findings to the SDGs and presents a sustainable RWH plan. The proposed strategy offers sustainable solutions to different problems (e.g., water shortage, environmental, and socioeconomic). In Wadi Watir, various studies have been conducted using similar tools for RWH site selection. Al-Zayed et al. (2013)  used GIS and HM to assess the potential for water harvesting. They calculated the amount of water that could be harvested and proposed water harvesting systems. However, MCA was not included in their work, and RWH suitability maps were not provided. Elewa et al. (2021)  integrated RS, GIS, WMS, and AHP to determine the RWH potential. Appropriate locations for RWH structures (dams, and cisterns) were proposed. However, the socioeconomic aspects were not included in their analysis. The final RWH maps of their study and the current study were different, as all the utilized parameters in their work (even the slope map) were calculated for each sub-watershed and then interpolated for the whole watershed. The previous studies presented useful insights for RWH site selection. However, Boolean analysis (restricted area for RWH), the depression depth technique (optimal sites for RWH structures), and achieving the targets of the SDGs (sustainable RWH plan) were not considered. The current research aims to fill these gaps by applying the mentioned framework.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study area The Wadi Watir watershed, selected as the study area, lies between longitude 33°53″E to 34°44′E and latitude 28°46″N to 29°33′N with an area of 3580 km2  (Fig. 1  ). Wadi Watir, situated in the South Sinai governorate in Egypt, is a hyperarid catchment. It is regarded as the main Aqaba Gulf watershed. The city of Nuweiba is located at the outlet of the watershed. It is a very significant historical and tourist city on the Sinai Peninsula. Furthermore, Nuweiba Harbor connects Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. Due to the importance of Wadi Watir, it has been studied by many researchers (Elewa et al., 2021 ; Mostafa, 2020 ; Osama, 2019 ; Sara et al., 2016 ). Wadi Watir is experiencing a water shortage, and the Bedouins suffer from the destruction of crops and livestock. It is evident that water demand increases rapidly for different reasons (Al-Zayed et al., 2013 ; Osama, 2019 ). Al-Zayed et al. (2013)  performed a field survey through interviews with residents of Wadi Watir. They found that most of the respondents support the construction of RWH structures. Bedouins prefer to use the harvested water for domestic use, grazing, and agriculture, respectively. Dadamouny and Schnittler (2016)  demonstrated rapid climate change in the Sinai Peninsula. The analysis showed an apparent tendency to increase the average temperature and reduce the rainfall. This tendency resulted in severe droughts that were abruptly interrupted by heavy and unexpected rainfall for several years. They showed that the continuation of current temperature and rainfall trends would negatively affect the socioeconomic and environmental systems in the region. They recommended the construction of dams in different areas of Sinai, like Wadi Watir. The watershed is dominated by Precambrian granitic, metamorphic, and volcanic rocks intruded by acidic to basic dykes. The primary discharge sources of the groundwater are at the Main Channel (El Shiekh Attia) and Furtaga Springs, which are located upgradient the alluvial aquifers. The deposits of the Watir delta consist substantially of quaternary fine-to-coarse sands, gravels, and boulders that are usually mixed with silt and clay (Eissa et al., 2016 ; Elewa et al., 2021 ; Osama, 2019 ). In Wadi Watir region, structural elements such as faults, fractures, and joints contribute to the hydrogeological setting. Surface runoff water infiltrates mainly through these structures and forms a significant portion of the groundwater in the watershed. The topography of the area varies from flat plains to steep mountains. Altitudes range from 4 to 1630 m above sea level. The precipitation in Wadi Watir is about 200 million m3 /year (Osama, 2019 ), or 55.86 mm/year.  2.2 Data collection The data used in the study were collected from different resources.• The digital elevation model (DEM) was obtained from the USGS Earth Explorer website. It has a 30 m resolution using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data (USGS, 2021 ).  • The meteorological data were collected for three essential rain gauges around the study zone for the interval from 1934 to 2014. The source of this data is the Water Resources Research Institute (WRRI, 2014 ) and the studies already published (Eissa et al., 2016 ; Osama, 2019 ; Sara et al., 2016 ).  • The soil data were derived from the USGS website based on the National Geologic Map Database (NGMDB, 2021 ).  • Land use/land cover data were derived from Landsat satellite images (Landsat 8, 30 m resolution) (USGS, 2021 ).  • The data for lineament frequency analysis were extracted from Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS (USGS, 2021 ).     2.3 Thematic layer selection and preparation Thematic layers used in this analysis were chosen for their data availability and scientific validity. In addition, they have been recommended by the FAO and used in many previous surveys (Adham et al., 2016 ; Jha et al., 2014 ; Matomela et al., 2020 ; Singh et al., 2017 ). The eleven thematic layers selected for the WLC are runoff depth, slope (%), basin area, maximum flow distance (MFD), topographic wetness index (TWI), drainage density, lineament frequency density (LFD), land use, infiltration number, distance to built-up areas and Bedouin communities, and distance to roads. The thematic layers were prepared in ArcGIS 10.5 (ESRI, 2016 ) for the site selection process. The boundary delineation of Wadi Watir was performed using the SRTM DEM. The DEM was used to generate the slope map, TWI map, and the stream orders of the watershed. The stream orders were then utilized to calculate the drainage density of the research area. Radiometric and geometric error correction of Landsat 8 images was applied in the GIS environment. A supervised classification was performed to create a land use map. The precision of the land use map was enhanced and verified through satellite images. The watershed was divided into 25 sub-watersheds consistent with the division made by the WRRI. The basin area, MFD, and infiltration number were calculated for each sub-watershed and then interpolated for the whole watershed in a GIS environment. ENVI 5.3 (ENVI, 2015 ), Geomatica 2017 (PCI, 2017 ), and ArcGIS 10.5 (ESRI, 2016 ) were used to prepare the thematic layer for the LFD. All thematic layers and their features were reclassified and given weights based on their degree of suitability as RWH sites, as listed in Table 1  . Weights and criteria were adopted and updated from previous studies to eliminate discrepancies in weight assignment (Adham et al., 2016 ; Al-adamat et al., 2010 ; Jha et al., 2014 ; Matomela et al., 2020 ; Saaty, 1990 ; Singh et al., 2017 ; Tiwari et al., 2018 ). The variables in the Boolean overlay are clear (true or false). The utilization of the Boolean parameters is crucial to exclude some locations that were chosen using the WLC method. Three constraint layers were selected to upgrade the site suitability process: distance to built-up areas and Bedouin communities, distance to faults, and distance to roads. Table 2   shows the Boolean criteria and rationale.  2.4 Multi-criteria analysis Spatial data, as input, are incorporated and converted into a raster format as an output by the MCA. Saaty's scale (Saaty, 1990 ) was utilized to convert the qualitative data of each theme into quantitative values through the construction of a pairwise comparison matrix. Saaty's AHP was applied to assign and normalize the weights of the criteria. The consistency ratio (CR), proposed by Wind and Saaty (1980) , was estimated to verify the consistency of the weights assigned to various themes. The following Equation demonstrates the CR  calculation:(1) C R = C I  R C I        where CI  is the consistency index, and R CI   is the random consistency index. CI  can be obtained as follows:(2) C I = λ m a x   − n  n − 1       where λ max   is the essential eigenvalue determined using the eigenvector method and n  is the total number of layers (criteria). Wind and Saaty (1980)  clarified that the value of CR  must be < 0.1; otherwise, the assigned weights should be corrected for consistency preservation.  2.5 Runoff calculations The SCS-CN method (SCS, 1956 ) was utilized to obtain the annual flood volume (runoff depth) using the watershed modeling system software (WMS 10.1) (EMRL, 2017 ). Various studies have estimated runoff from rainfall data using this method (Elewa et al., 2021 ; Gautam et al., 2019 ; Matomela et al., 2020 ; Singh et al., 2017 ; Tiwari et al., 2018 ). The SCS-CN method is substantially dependent on dimensionless curve number (CN) values, which must be calculated precisely to obtain reliable results. CN estimation depends on land use and the hydrologic soil group (HSG). The weighted curve number for the whole watershed (CN w  ) was calculated using WMS. The HEC-1 hydraulic model transformed the precipitation data into a runoff hydrograph. The impact area of each weather station was determined using the Thiessen polygon method (Schumann, 1998 ). The SCS-CN can be applied for runoff determination through the following Equation (SCS, 1956 ):(3) Q = ( P − 0.2 S  )  2  ( P + 0.8 S  )    ( P > 0.2 S  )      where Q  is the volume of direct surface runoff (direct surface runoff depth in mm), P  is the total precipitation (mm), and S  is the maximum potential water abstraction by soil in (mm). S  can be expressed as follows:(4) S = 25400 C N w    − 254     where CN w   is the weighted curve number for the whole watershed. CN w   can be determined as follows:(5) C N w  = ∑ ( C N i  ∗ A i   )   A      where CN i   is the curve number for each sub-watershed, A i   is the area of each sub-watershed, and A  is the area of the whole watershed.  2.6 Rainwater harvesting suitability The WLC method is a decision rule for creating aggregate maps utilizing GIS. The WLC method is widely applied in GIS suitability mapping and MCA. The WLC method was combined with Boolean factors to eliminate some features from the site selection process and suitability map generation. The Equation used can be expressed as follows:(6) R W H P I = R F n w   . R F f  + S L n w   . S L f  + B A n w   . B A f  + M F D n w   . M F D f  + T W I n w   . T W I f  + D D n w   . D D f  + L F D n w   . L F D f  + L U n w   . L U f  + F N n w   . F N f  + B d i s n w   . B d i s f  + R d i s n w   . R d i s f      where RWHPI  is the rainwater harvesting potential index, RF nw   is the normalized weight of the runoff theme, RF f   is the weight of a feature of the runoff theme, SL nw   is the normalized weight of the slope theme, SL f   is the weight of a feature of the slope theme, BA nw   is the normalized weight of the basin area theme, BA f   is the weight of a feature of the basin area theme, MFD nw   is the normalized weight of the MFD theme, MFD f   is the weight of a feature of the MFD theme, TWI nw   is the normalized weight of the TWI theme, TWI f   is the weight of a feature of the TWI theme, DD nw   is the normalized weight of the drainage density theme, DD f   is the weight of a feature of the drainage density theme, LFD nw   is the normalized weight of the LFD theme, LFD f   is the weight of a feature of the LFD theme, LU nw   is the normalized weight of the land use theme, LU f   is the weight of a feature of the land use theme, FN nw   is the normalized weight of the infiltration number theme, FN f   is the weight of a feature of the infiltration number theme, Bdis nw   is the normalized weight of the distance to built-up areas and Bedouin communities theme, Bdis f   is the weight of a feature of the distance to built-up areas and Bedouin communities theme, Rdis nw   is the normalized weight of the distance to roads theme, and Rdis f   is the weight of a feature of the distance to roads theme. Equation (6)  makes a raster map that shows the suitability of the research area for RWH. RWHPI  is a dimensionless value resulting from Equation (6) . The RWHPI  values are classified into five categories to determine the land suitability of RWH for Wadi Watir. This method has been utilized in various studies and proven successful (Adham et al., 2016 ; Al-adamat et al., 2010 ; Jha et al., 2014 ; Matomela et al., 2020 ; Saaty, 1990 ; Tiwari et al., 2018 ). The Boolean criteria that classified as unsuitable for RWH were merged in one constraint layer. This layer was combined with the output layer from the WLC method to produce the final RWH suitability map.  2.7 Localization of optimum sites for the RWH structures The depression depth results from subtracting the initial DEM from the filled DEM. The depression depth and output layers from WLC and Boolean criteria were integrated. RWH structures are recommended for sites with contiguous depression zones and high suitability for RWH (Matomela et al., 2020 ). Topography, land use, and soil characteristics are the basic parameters for locating a structure for Boolean logic. The applied criteria for structure site selection are detailed in Table 3  . GIS was used to create a buffer zone (50 m) around second-and third-order streams to determine appropriate sites for percolation tanks and check dams (Jha et al., 2014 ; Matomela et al., 2020 ; Singh et al., 2017 ). Fig. 2   shows the flowchart of the applied methodology.   3 Results and discussion 3.1 Thematic layers for RWH suitability mapping Thematic layers selected based on their efficiency for RWH suitability determination are presented in the following. 3.1.1 Slope map The SRTM DEM was used to produce a slope map with the GIS environment. The slopes in the study zone vary widely from gentle to very rough. The slope percentage is split into three parts: mild (<5%), moderate (from 5% to 10%), and steep (>10%) (Fig. 3  (a)). Most of the watershed falls under the steep slope category due to the rugged nature of the watershed (2250 km2  or 63%). This portion is the least suitable for RWH. Furthermore, gentle and moderate slopes have coverage areas of 680 km2  (19%) and 650 km2  (18%), respectively. According to Adham et al. (2018) , a slope less than 5% is the most appropriate for RWH. Therefore, according to the slope map, 19% of the research area is highly suitable for RWH.  3.1.2 Land use/land cover map The land use map was generated from Landsat 8 images with a resolution of 30 m. The land use of Wadi Watir falls into five categories: bare land, agriculture, built-up areas, streams, and water. As demonstrated in Fig. 3 (b), the major part of the research area is bare land with a coverage area of 3330 km2  (93%). The total area of the streams is 224 km2  (6.28%), whereas the agriculture, built-up, and water areas are 18 km2  (0.5%), 7.3 km2  (0.2%), and 0.7 km2  (0.02%), respectively. The land use map was improved and verified using satellite images. The current map supports the hypothesis that the study area is arid. Streams are best suited for RWH, and bare land is moderately appropriate. Based on the land use/land cover map, 99% of the watershed is convenient for RWH.  3.1.3 Runoff map Runoff is the main criterion that determines the suitability of an area for RWH, as the higher the depth of runoff, the greater the suitability of RWH. A soil classification map was utilized to generate the HSG map. The land use and HSG maps were used to obtain CN w   using WMS software. As shown in Fig. 3 (c), the runoff depth (mm) falls into three classes: low (6.50–10.00), moderate (10.01–12.05), and high (12.06–13.25). The maximum runoff depth is 13.25 mm, and the minimum is 6.5 mm. The highest runoff depths are distributed in the northern and southern parts of the study area. The lowest depths are in the middle.  3.1.4 Basin area map Basin area is a significant factor for RWH. Increasing the basin area increases the volume of rain collected, resulting in higher peak flood discharges. The area of each sub-watershed was calculated and interpolated using ArcGIS. The basin area is classified into three categories: low (9.3–84.7) km2 , moderate (84.7–226.5) km2 , and high (226.5–527.7) km2 . The high basin areas are in the southwestern part of the study area and a small area in the northern section, while the lower areas are in the eastern part (Fig. 3 (d)).  3.1.5 Maximum flow distance map The MFD values were calculated for each sub-basin using WMS software. It is known that the higher the MFD, the higher the RWH potentiality. As displayed in Fig. 3 (e), the MFD is divided into three categories. The highest MFD values are along the western side of the watershed, and the lowest values are in the middle of the eastern section. The results of the MFD are highly related to the basin area, which is demonstrated on the maps of the two thematic layers.  3.1.6 Drainage density map The drainage density of Wadi Watir was estimated using the SRTM DEM by determining the stream orders in the GIS environment. Drainage density is a significant factor for RWH suitability and locating the best storage structures sites. Increasing drainage density leads to increased runoff generation (Mugo and Odera, 2019 ). The drainage density of the research area is divided into three classes, as shown in Fig. 3 (f). Drainage density values for 1619 km2  and 1850 km2  of the watershed are classified as low and moderate, respectively. Only 111 km2  of Wadi Watir has high drainage density values, which is highly suitable for RWH.  3.1.7 Topographic wetness index map The TWI map was generated from the slope map using spatial analyst tools in ArcGIS. Higher TWI values indicate a high probability for water concentration and, therefore, high RWH potentiality (Berhanu and Bisrat, 2018 ). As shown in Fig. 3 (g), the TWI values are divided into three classes: low (2.47–6.88) (63%), moderate (6.89–10.60) (30%), and high (10.61–25.4) (7%). The high TWI values are the most suitable for RWH.  3.1.8 Infiltration number map The infiltration number depends mainly on the distribution of streams of the watershed. The infiltration number is the product of the stream frequency and drainage density, whereas high infiltration number values indicate a low potential for RWH. Most of the study area has high infiltration number values. The moderate and low values are relatively small areas in the middle and southern parts of the watershed (Fig. 3 (h)).  3.1.9 Lineament frequency density map Investigation of LFD is essential for the determination of the RWH. The RWH potential is reduced by increasing the LFD. Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS data were processed in ENVI 5.3 and Geomatica 2017 to extract the lineaments of the study area. ArcGIS was used to create the LFD map. The LFD values are divided into three classes: low (0.0–0.52), moderate (0.53–1.05), and high (1.06–1.57), as seen in Fig. 3 (i). Most of the Wadi Watir has low LFD values (73%). LFD values are moderate or high in 24% and 3% of the Wadi, respectively. Approximately all these areas are distributed in the eastern half of the watershed.   3.2 Weight assignment and multi-criteria analysis The thematic layers and features were assigned weights from 1 to 9, according to Saaty (1990)  (Table 1 ). A pairwise comparison matrix was created for the research criteria (Table 4  ). The normalized weights were computed using the AHP and eigenvector method. The CR was calculated, and its value was 0.002, which is within the limit specified by Saaty (<0.1). The value of the CR clarified that the chosen criteria are consistent.  3.3 Rainwater harvesting suitability map The WLC analysis of the eleven thematic layers was implemented using Equation (6) . The technique was applied in a GIS environment to generate an RWH suitability map, as shown in Fig. 4  (a). The RWH suitability is classified into five categories according to the value of RWHPI : very low (3.41–4.38), low (4.39–4.79), moderate (4.80–5.18), high (5.19–5.62), and very high (5.63–6.70). The Boolean technique was applied using the three constraints shown in Table 2 . All the constraints were combined into one map and classified into two categories, namely, suitable or unsuitable, as shown in Fig. 4 (b). The WLC and Boolean analysis maps were merged to produce a final RWH suitability map (Fig. 4 (c)). The results illustrated that 7% (236 km2 ) of Wadi Watir is very high suitable for RWH, and 12% (430 km2 ) is highly suitable. Approximately all of this area is situated along streams in the watershed. RWH is restricted to 16% (573 km2 ) of the study zone. The suitability is low (23%; 832 km2 ) and very low (17%; 618 km2 ) for 40% (1450 km2 ) of Wadi Watir. The area least suitable for RWH is in the middle of the watershed. Moderate suitability for RWH is observed in 25% (891 km2 ) of the research area. The suitability of RWH for the Wadi Watir watershed is normally distributed (Fig. 4 (d)). The segmentation of RWH suitability is due to the mountainous nature and steep slopes of Wadi Watir. About 31% (178 km2 ) of the restricted area for RWH is within the high and very high suitability zones. Therefore, the percentage of high and very high suitable areas for RWH is relatively small (17%) in comparison to previous studies. However, the restricted area is necessary owing to the socioeconomic significance of the Boolean analysis. Streams are the best zones for RWH owing to their mild slope, high runoff, and accessibility. Most Nuweiba city is restricted to RWH due to the built-up areas and the city's main roads.  3.4 Siting of RWH structures Optimal sites for RWH structures were determined using the previously mentioned methodology and according to the criteria described in Table 3 . The contiguous depression depths resulting from the DEM were combined with the high and very high suitability areas for RWH to identify optimal sites for RWH structures. The structures considered in the study are percolation tanks (on the ground and along streams), check dams, and farm ponds. The Boolean approach, created by Singh et al. (2017) , was used to specify the sites of the RWH structure. The sites were selected to be far from the already existing structures, as shown in Fig. 5  . The efficiency of this method was verified through the existing structures, as these structures are at the intersection of the depression depths and the high and very high suitability areas. Twelve sites are appropriate for check dams: five in the southwestern part, three in the middle, two in the southeastern part, and two in the northern part. For percolation tanks along the streams, 14 sites are optimum: four in the southeastern part and the rest in the middle of Wadi Watir. The area considered to be ideal for percolation tanks is 25.9 km2 . This zone is primarily located in the central and southern parts of the study area. The optimal space for farm ponds is 1.34 km2 , close to the farmland. The soil texture is the main parameter that affects the distribution of the RWH structures. Some of the proposed structures are near the current Bedouin communities. These structures can be used to fill the current deficit in water needs and improve the Bedouins' standard of living. The regions around the structures far from the existing Bedouin communities are potential sites for new communities. RWH structures may affect the watershed ecological system widely. Although socioeconomic parameters are considered in the current study, potential upstream and downstream impacts should be investigated before implementing RWH systems.  3.5 Sustainable RWH plan The development of the area in the study or any other region should be implemented using sustainable strategies (Saqr et al., 2021 ). Sustainable plans should be linked to the SDGs (UN, 2020 ). Taking this into account, the current research aims to present a sustainable RWH plan by achieving the targets of the SDGs. The linkages between the current study and the targets of the SDGs are clarified. The study's findings are linked to the SDGs to offer sustainable solutions to the main problems faced by the residents of Wadi Watir. Integrated management of natural resources, especially water resources, is the objective of the following SDGs: Target 6.5 ″Implement integrated water resources management” and Target 12.2 ″Sustainable management of natural resources.” The topic of the current study—RWH—is a significant component of integrated water resources management. The SDGs of Target 6.4 ″Address water scarcity”, Target 6.A “Expand water harvesting”, and Target 6.6 ″Restore aquifers” support the idea of eliminating the problem of water scarcity through water harvesting and ground recharge. The essential objective of the current research is to implement RWH systems in order to solve the water scarcity problem. The proposed structures (percolation tanks) are used for groundwater recharge; groundwater is considered to be the most essential source of drinking water for the local inhabitants. The equitable distribution of these structures for all Bedouin communities in Wadi Watir achieves Target 6.1 ″Access to water for all." Target 6.B “Participation of local communities in water management” and Target 12.8 ″Promote awareness for sustainable development” are essential for the sustainable development of Wadi Watir. Public awareness of the importance of RWH systems could be raised via mass communication (e.g., field visits, training courses). In addition, Bedouins should participate in the planning and implementation of management strategies. This cooperation would facilitate the construction, conservation, and maintenance of the structures. Agriculture is at the core of a number of SDG targets. For example, Target 2.3 ″Double agricultural productivity”, Target 15.3 ″Combat desertification”, and Target 2.4 ″Implement resilient agricultural practices.” In this regard, the construction of suggested structures (farm ponds and check dams) and encouragement of forestation are significant. These measures will increase the area of cultivated land and decrease desertification. In addition, the selection of crops with low water consumption and high productivity, as well as the application of such modern irrigation techniques as drip and sprinkler, are vitally important. Furthermore, agricultural expansion will solve socioeconomic problems and achieve numerous targets. It will increase food productivity, raise the income levels of the inhabitants, and create job opportunities, ultimately eliminating poverty and hunger. To this end, the relevant targets are Target 1.2 ″Reduce poverty”, Target 2.1 ″End hunger”, Target 8.3 ″Promote job creation”, and Target 9.1 ″Support economic development." Using affordable and clean energy is the seventh goal of the SDGs (e.g., Target 7.2 ″Increase renewable energy”). The energy required for agriculture and domestic purposes can be obtained from renewable energy resources such as solar energy. Solar energy is clean and safe for the environment. Solar panels are now relatively cheap and widely available. The panels can be installed above farm ponds and lakes upstream of check dams. This system would decrease evaporation loss and provide the required energy. Climate change is now a global issue. Taking this into consideration, the SDGs encourage reducing and adapting to the effects of climate change. This is addressed by the following targets: Target 1.5 ″Reduce climate-related extreme events”, Target 11.B “Adaptation to climate change”, and Target 13.1 ″Strengthen resilience to climate-related hazards.” The area in the study is vulnerable to climate change, which may cause natural disasters such as flash floods. The construction of RWH structures can mitigate the danger posed by flash floods and protect the tourist city of Nuweiba and the main roads in the watershed. Accordingly, Target 8.9 ″Promote tourism” can be achieved. It can be concluded that the current study is connected directly to the targets of the sixth goal, “Clean Water and Sanitation.” However, the study can be linked to a number of socioeconomic and environmental SDGs. The RWH plan offers sustainable solutions to various problems faced by local inhabitants. The presented strategy (plan and results) can assist water managers and planners in determining the optimal sites for RWH structures and solving the problems of local communities. The applied method utilizes available data from public domains. This makes the method suitable for regions with limited ground data (e.g., semi-arid and arid regions in developing countries).   4 Conclusion The study described here identified RWH-suitable sites in the Wadi Watir region of the Sinai Peninsula and determined the optimal sites and zones for RWH structures. The study's novelty lies in how its findings can support the realization of SDGs for developing sustainable RWH strategies. Combining GIS (i.e., WLC and Boolean analysis), HM (i.e., WMS and HEC-1), MCA (i.e., AHP), and the depression depth technique supported the accuracy of the findings, as did using biophysical (e.g., runoff, basin area, slope, and land use) and socioeconomic parameters (e.g., distance to built-up areas, Bedouin communities, and roads). Moreover, the consistency ratio of the parameters considered revealed that the developed criteria were consistent. The main findings from this study can be summarized as follows:• The final RWH map showed that 19% (666 km2 ) of Wadi Watir is highly suitable for RWH. Approximately all of this area is situated along the streams of the watershed. These results are due to the study area's steep slopes and mountainous nature.  • Twelve sites are found to be appropriate for check dams. Fourteen sites are determined to be optimal for locating percolation tanks along the streams. The area considered to be ideal for on-ground percolation tanks is 25.9 km2 . The optimal space for farm ponds is 1.34 km2 .  • The application of the sustainable RWH plan is significant for the development of Wadi Watir. The proposed plan has many benefits for individuals and society. There is a match between the objectives of the current study and the targets of SDG 6 (e.g., Target 6.1 ″Access to water for all”, Target 6.4 ″Address water scarcity”, Target 6.A “Expand water harvesting”, and Target 6.6 ″Restore aquifers”). Hence, the installation of the proposed RWH systems provides sustainable solutions to the problem of water scarcity and achieves the targets of the SDGs.  • The research's approach shows various linkages with diverse social, economic, and environmental SDGs and highlights sustainable solutions for social, economic, and environmental challenges—for example, using solar energy to generate power, and expanding agriculture to create job opportunities.    Our framework can help water engineers, planners, and managers to improve future development plans for the Wadi Watir region. The developed approach for identifying RWH-suitable sites requires less effort, time, and cost than other known approaches (which depend mainly on field data) and can be applied in various regions experiencing water scarcity. However, implementing RWH systems requires additional studies, including detailed field surveys of the proposed RWH sites, complete site characterizations, and the evaluation and monitoring of surface flooding operations.
