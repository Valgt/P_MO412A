                  India has adopted the 2030 Agenda during the United Nations Summit held in September 2015. Energy is intimately connected with 74% of the 169 targets related to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030. Subsequently, India has also submitted its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) for the period 2021–2030 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). While the Government of India (GOI) has ambitious plans for enhancing the installed capacity of RE sources, 75% of its electricity is currently generated by coal-fired power plants. As India's electricity requirements grow to meet the aspirations of 1.3 Bi people, it needs a policy framework that integrates all low-carbon energy technologies with coal in such a manner that the reliability, security, and affordability of electric supply are balanced with sustainable development. India also needs to develop innovative strategies to clean up the country's coal sector while enhancing the integration of renewable energy into the National Power Grid. In this context, certain recommendations are proposed in this article for timely implementation by GOI to facilitate the achievement of India's targets with respect to SDG 7 and the NDCs in an efficient and effective manner.

Srikanth  National Institute of Advanced Studies, Indian Institute of Science Campus, Bengaluru, India National Institute of Advanced Studies, Indian Institute of Science Campus Bengaluru India       India has adopted the 2030 Agenda during the United Nations Summit held in September 2015. Energy is intimately connected with 74% of the 169 targets related to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030. Subsequently, India has also submitted its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) for the period 2021–2030 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). While the Government of India (GOI) has ambitious plans for enhancing the installed capacity of RE sources, 75% of its electricity is currently generated by coal-fired power plants. As India's electricity requirements grow to meet the aspirations of 1.3 Bi people, it needs a policy framework that integrates all low-carbon energy technologies with coal in such a manner that the reliability, security, and affordability of electric supply are balanced with sustainable development. India also needs to develop innovative strategies to clean up the country's coal sector while enhancing the integration of renewable energy into the National Power Grid. In this context, certain recommendations are proposed in this article for timely implementation by GOI to facilitate the achievement of India's targets with respect to SDG 7 and the NDCs in an efficient and effective manner.   Keywords Energy and environment  Renewable energy  Electricity policy  Power sector reforms  Low-carbon economy    1 Introduction The global consciousness for the protection of environment in the early seventies prompted Government of India (GOI) to amend the Constitution of India in 1976, to mandate that protection and improvement of natural environment is the Duty of the State (Article 48 A - Directive Principles of State Policy) and the Fundamental Duty (Article 51 A (g)) of every citizen (MLJ, 2016a ). In 1991, the Hon Supreme Court of India even made the environment a part of the Fundamental Rights of every Citizen by declaring that, “Right to live is a fundamental right under Art. 21 of the Constitution and includes the right of enjoyment of pollution free water and air for full enjoyment of life  (Subhash Kumar versus State of India and Others, 1991 ). The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda) finalized by the United Nations includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 associated targets to measure the progress towards achievement of the 2030 Agenda. The SDGs are integrated and indivisible and balance the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development (United Nations, 2015 ). India has adopted the 2030 Agenda during the United Nations Summit held in September 2015 (United Nations, 2017 ). Unlike the Millennium Development Goals, which preceded the SDGs, provision of energy services has found an important place amongst the SDGs (United Nations, 2015 ). Specifically, SDG 7 is to: ‘Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all .’ The World Bank has documented the inter-connections between energy and 125 out of the 169 targets (74%) related to the 17 SDGs. Therefore, ‘planning for universal access to modern energy services should be an integral part of national planning efforts to achieve the SDGs ’ (World Bank, 2017 ). Subsequent to the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, India ratified the Paris Agreement on 2 October 2016 and has submitted inter alia the following NDCs to the UNFCCC for the period 2021–2030 (MOEFandCC, 2017a ; UNFCCC, 2015 ).• Reduce Green House Gas (GHG) emissions intensity of India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 33–35% by 2030 from the 2005 level;  • Enhance generation capacity of non-fossil fuel based sources to 40% of all sources by 2030 with the help of transfer of technology and low-cost international finance including from Green Climate Fund;  • Create an additional carbon sink of 2.5–3 billion tonnes of CO2  equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030.    Affordable, reliable and modern energy services are crucial to achieving all of the SDGs. Therefore, SDG 7 is central to every major challenge that India has to overcome today and in the near future. In this context, the key purpose of this article is to examine India's strategy and ongoing action plans to achieve SDG 7 as well as the NDCs by 2030, assess any gaps in the path towards achievement of these National goals, and suggest measures to bridge these gaps. Specifically, there is a need to develop an orderly transition to a low-carbon economy, so that India can achieve its SDGs and NDCs in an efficient, effective and sustainable manner. This article has six more sections. Section 2  gives a brief overview of India's electricity (power) sector. Section 3  summarizes India's key actions to address climate change. Section 4  discusses the key challenges to be overcome for India to achieve its NDCs and the SDG targets related to energy. Since India's power sector is highly dependent on coal, Section 5  indicates the key clean coal technologies adopted by India to enhance environmental compliance of its Coal-fired Power Plants (CPPs). Section 6  indicates the key policies to be implemented by India to enhance its carbon sink. Section 7  concludes with overall policy recommendations.  2 India's electricity sector India is the third largest electricity generator in the World behind China and USA, but its per capita electricity consumption of 1117 kWh in 2017 was less than one-fourth that of China, and one-third of the World average (BP, 2018a; World Bank, 2018 ). During the Financial Year 2017–18 (FY 18), coal, gas, hydro, nuclear, and Renewable Energy (RE) sources (including, wind, solar, bio-energy, small hydro) contributed: 75%, 4%, 10%, 3%, and 8%, respectively of the 1309 TWh of total electricity generated by utilities in India (CEA, 2018a ). Non-utilities (captive power plants that produce electricity largely for consumption in their own industrial plant(s) and release the surplus to the grid) generated 19.7 TWh in FY 17 on top of the 1242 TWh generated by utilities in that year (MOSPI, 2018 ). During FY 18, the share of CPPs in the total electricity generated in India varied between 70% (during the monsoon months of July and August 2017 when large hydropower plants contributed 14.7% of the total electricity generated) and 80% (during the post-monsoon months of January and February 2018) with an annual average of just over 75% (see  Fig. 1 ). The installed capacity of electricity generation in India increased by 99.2 GW between April 2012 and March 2017 against a targeted expansion of 88.5 GW (CEA, 2018a ). As a result, the All-India average energy deficit (gap between ‘energy requirement’ and ‘energy supplied’) was only 0.7% during FY 18, while the power deficit (gap between ‘peak demand’ and ‘peak met’) was approximately 2% during the same period (MOP, 2018a ). These figures indicate a great improvement in electricity supply when compared with the All-India average energy deficit of 8.7% and power deficit of 9% as recently as in FY 13 (CEA, 2018b ). However, several CPPs in India are under financial stress due to the lack of inadequate demand in the form of Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) from State-owned Power Distribution Companies or DISCOMS (Lok Sabha, 2018a ). Electricity is in the Concurrent List of the Constitution of India. Distribution of electricity and management of associated functions are handled by DISCOMS which are largely owned by the respective State Governments. Therefore, the inherent variability in the quality of governance in each State has resulted in disparities not only in the last mile electricity distribution systems in the respective States but also in the financial health of the DISCOMS serving these States. These disparities are also evident in the large variations between the power deficits in different regions as well as between the States. For example, the State of Maharashtra with the highest power demand of 23.4 GW during FY 18 had a power deficit of only 0.2%, while the State of Uttar Pradesh which had the second highest peak demand in India (20.5 GW) had a power deficit of 10.9% during the same period (MOP, 2018c ). According to India's Ministry of Power (MOP), of the 177 million rural households in the country, only 152 million (86%) have been provided with an electrical connection as on 11 July 2018 (MOP, 2018b ). On the other hand, the Ministry has also declared that India is a power ‘surplus’ country because the total installed electricity generation capacity in the country exceeds 344 GW against a peak demand which has never exceeded 170 GW till date (MOP, 2018c ). The deficit in supply to the aforesaid 25 million rural households is primarily because of the DISCOMs’ reluctance to procure power from the generating companies, either because they lack the funds required to procure adequate quantum of power to meet the unserved/under-served demand or because they want to limit their losses due to under-recoveries from these consumers, or both. Further, several DISCOMS in India resort to power cuts during peak hours rather than procuring costlier power to meet the peak demand. Central Electricity Authority (CEA, 2018c ) has projected that during the ongoing FY 19:• India's requirement of electrical energy will increase to 1337 TWh from the FY 18 level of 1309 TWh while the peak demand will exceed 180 GW from the FY 18 level of 164 GW.  • At the All-India level, India is likely to have a peak surplus of 2.5% in terms of electrical power and a surplus of 4.6% in electrical energy; however, the Northern, and Southern regions of the country are likely to face power deficits of the order of 1.2% and 4.5%, respectively.    As per India's National Electricity Plan prepared by the CEA, the quantum of electricity required to meet India's growth aspirations is projected to increase to 1566 TWh in FY 22 and further to 2047 TWh in FY 27 (CEA, 2018b ). In line with the increasing requirement of electrical energy, the peak electricity demand is projected to increase from the FY 18 level of 164 GW to 226 GW in 2022 and further to 299 GW in FY 27 (MOP, 2018a, 2018d ). As of 31 March 2018, fossil fuel sources have a share of 65% in the total electrical generation capacity of electrical utilities in India, while non-fossil fuel (hydro, nuclear, and RE) sources have the balance 35% of generation capacity in India (CEA, 2018d ). Further, power plants with a total generation capacity of 58 GW comprising of 48 GW thermal, 6.8 GW hydro, and 3.3 GW nuclear, are at various stages of construction. These new power plants will progressively replace old and inefficient CPPs with a combined capacity of 22.7 GW that are not in a position to comply with current environment norms (MOP, 2018d ). In addition, GOI is also projecting an increase in RE capacity to 175 GW by March 2022 from the March 2018 level of 69 GW (CEA, 2018b, 2018d ). Even after the generation capacity of RE sources reaches the projected level of 175 GW by FY 22, RE sources are expected to generate only 19% of the electricity produced in India in FY 22 compared to their current share of 8% (CEA, 2018a; MOP, 2018d ). However, the share of RE in the total electricity generated in the Southern and Western regions of the country will be much higher than the All-India average (NREL, 2017a, 2017b ). A committee set up by India's Ministry of Power (MOP) has submitted broad recommendations for an optimal energy mix for India during 2022 and 2027 under various scenarios (MOP, 2018d ). The base case studied by this committee is based on GOI's projections for RE generation capacity to reach 175 GW by March 2022 and 275 GW by March 2027. In this base case scenario, CPPs are projected to generate 63% and 56% of the total electricity generated by utilities in FY 22 and FY 27, respectively (MOP, 2018d ). However, in absolute terms, coal-based generation by utilities is expected to increase from 986 TWh in FY 18 to 1072 TWh in FY 22 and further to 1239 TWh in FY 27 (CEA, 2018a; MOP, 2018d ). If GOI's projections for 175 GW of RE capacity in 2022 are not realized, the share of CPPs during 2022 will increase beyond their projected share of 63% in the base case since CPPs are currently underutilized in India (CEA, 2018c ). The dependence on coal for power generation in India is due to its relative abundance within the country. India is the second largest coal producer in the World and produced 716 MT of coal in 2017 with a global share of 9.3% (BP, 2018a ). On a reserve basis, India has the 5th largest endowment with 9.4% (98 billion tons or BT) of the world's proved coal reserves at the end of 2017, but just 0.3% and 0.6% of world's oil and natural gas reserves, respectively (BP, 2018b ). In India, coal has a reserve to production ratio (defined as the ratio of the remaining proven reserves that are economically recoverable at the end of any year to the production in that year) of 136, whereas the corresponding figures for oil and gas are only 14 and 44 years, respectively (BP, 2018b ). Electricity consumption in India is likely to increase by approximately 241% between 2016 and 2040 during which the share of RE sources in electricity generation is projected to increase from 5% to 23% to balance the declining share of CPPs from 77% to 64% during the same period (BP, 2018c ). GOI has initiated the 24 × 7 Power for All (PFA) program to supply uninterrupted quality power to existing consumers and to provide electricity access to all unconnected customers by 2019 in a phased manner. The overriding objective of the PFA program is to achieve, ‘24 × 7 Affordable and Quality Power for All’  (PIB, 2018a ). The PFA program is directly related to the SDG 7 through its focus on all key aspects related to electricity, viz., affordability, reliability, and sustainability. However, the power and banking sectors of the Indian economy are reeling from a gross supply-demand mismatch leading to stressed assets (Business Line, 2018; PIB, 2018b ). As a result, ‘the weak financial health of the state-owned distribution utilities has led to slow progress in the signing of long-term PPAs through competitive bidding, with only 1.4 GW capacity tied up through long-term PPAs over the past three years ’ (Livemint, 2017 ). The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Energy has documented 34 stressed coal-fired Thermal Power Projects (TPPs) with a total outstanding debt of approximately Rs.1.75 Trillion, largely from GOI-owned Financial Institutions (Lok Sabha, 2018a ). The total generation capacity of these stressed TPPs exceeds 40 GW, out of which TPPs with a total capacity of 24 GW have already been commissioned (Lok Sabha, 2018a ). The stress in the power sector may be accentuated in future since several State Government-owned utilities are putting up greenfield CPPs even when the total installed generation capacity in India is more than double the peak demand (MOP, 2018c ). For example, the Government utilities in the RE-rich States of Tamil-Nadu and Telangana have started construction on two CPPs with capacities of 1320 MW and 4000 MW respectively during the last nine months (BHEL, 2017a, 2017b ). These greenfield CPPs are being financed by GOI-controlled financial institutions, viz., Power Finance Corporation and Rural Electrification Corporation. In order to resolve the stranded assets in the power sector, GOI has set up an Empowered Committee headed by the Cabinet Secretary with representatives from the Ministries of Coal, Finance, Power, and Railways along with the major lenders to the power sector (PIB, 2018b ).  3 India's action plans to address climate change India is one of the world's most vulnerable countries to climate change, and analyses of granular temperature and rainfall data indicate that extreme temperature increases and rainfall deficiencies due to climate change adversely affect agriculture yields, particularly in unirrigated regions of India (MOF, 2018a ). As per UNEP (2017)  data, India's per capita emission of 1.6 t (CO2  equivalent) in 2015 was about 38% of the World average (4.4 t) and less than one-fourth of that of China (6.6 t). In 2015, the power sector was the largest contributor of CO2  emissions in India, contributing about 50% (1066 Mt) of the 2066 Mt of total CO2  emissions from fuel combustion (IEA, 2017a ). Therefore, GOI is implementing the following key initiatives to meet its NDCs:• Ensuring widespread use of energy-efficient LED lamps and other energy-efficient appliances, which are currently reducing CO2  emissions by about 31 Mt per year, besides avoiding a peak demand of 7714 MW of electricity (UJALA, 2018 );  • Implementing an agricultural demand-side management program in which inefficient pump sets are being replaced by 5-star -rated energy-efficient pump sets that can also be powered by dedicated solar panels (EESL, 2018 );  • Increasing the contribution of electricity generated by Super-Critical (SC) technology, since the design efficiency of a Super-Critical CPP is 5% higher than that of a 500 MW subcritical CPP in India, thereby lowering CO2  emissions (MOP, 2017a ).  • Setting a stretch target of 175 GW for RE generation capacity by 2022 from the March 2018 level of 69 GW (CEA, 2018b, 2018d );  • Enforcing Bharat Stage-IV (BS IV) standards for four-wheeled vehicles, followed by the nation-wide transition from BS-IV to BS-VI by April 1, 2020 (Down-to-Earth, 2017a );  • Subsidizing the installation of roof-top solar plants on all private buildings and institutions, while granting achievement-linked incentives to government departments and companies installing rooftop solar plants (Solar Rooftop, 2018 );  • Launching the International Solar Alliance (ISA) jointly with France on 30 November 2015, to enhance collaboration among countries lying between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn for the promotion of solar energy (ISA, 2017 );  • Launching National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), comprising of eight missions in specific areas of solar energy, enhanced energy efficiency, habitat, water, sustaining Himalayan ecosystems, forestry, agriculture, and strategic knowledge for climate change to achieve climate goals (MOEFandCC, 2016 ).  • Developing four National Missions, namely National Solar Mission, National Mission on Enhanced Energy Efficiency, National Mission on Sustainable Habitat, and Green India Mission to give a special thrust to climate change mitigation (MOEFandCC, 2016 ).  • Implementing the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan which includes the promotion of electric vehicles, as a part of the NAPCC (DHI, 2017 ).     4 Key challenges in achieving India's NDCs and SDG 7 GOI aims to achieve the pre-2020 voluntary pledge of reducing the emissions intensity of India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 20–25% over 2005 levels by 2020. The emissions intensity of India's GDP has already reduced by 12% between 2005 and 2010 (MOEFandCC, 2016 ). The package of measures proposed by GOI in the National Electricity Plan (NEP) is projected to reduce the average CO2  emissions of India's power sector from 0.732 kg per kWh in FY 16 to 0.522 kg per kWh in FY 27 (CEA, 2018b ). India's Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has stated that each megawatt hour of electricity produced from RE sources in India abates 0.96 t of CO2  emission (MNRE, 2018a ). GOI has enacted a number of policy measures for increasing the share of renewable energy in India's energy mix (MNRE, 2018b ). As a result, electricity generation by RE sources has increased from 5.6% of total electricity generated by Indian utilities in FY 16 to reach a level of 8% during FY 18 (MNRE, 2018a ). The United Nations Environment Program has recognized India as one of the countries on track to achieve its voluntary pre-2020 pledge, and also likely to achieve its 2030 NDC targets if the current policies are fully implemented (UNEP, 2017 ). In order to provide a framework for procurement of solar and wind power through a transparent, standardized process of tariff-based bidding, India's Ministry of Power (MOP) has issued Standard Bidding Guidelines (SBG) for tariff-based competitive bidding for solar power and wind power on 3 August 2017 and 8 December 2017, respectively (MOP, 2017b, 2017c ). During the auctions conducted by power procurers adopting these SBGs, wind and solar energy tariffs have dropped below Rs.3 per kWh from the tariffs exceeding Rs.5 per kWh prior to 2014 (Lok Sabha, 2018b ). By March 2018, wind power (34 GW) accounted for nearly 50% of the total RE capacity in India (69 GW) and 55% of electricity generated by RE sources in India (CEA, 2018a ). India is not only the fourth largest producer of wind power in the World but also has a strong manufacturing base with an annual manufacturing capacity of 10 GW (MOP, 2017c ), unlike in solar PV modules where India is largely dependent on imports (Bridge to India, 2018 ). However, MNRE has missed the targets for solar and wind capacity additions by wide margins in both FY 17 and FY 18, though these two sources together are projected to account for 160 GW of the target RE capacity of 175 GW to be achieved by March 2022. While the slippage with respect to MNRE's target for solar and wind energy capacity addition (combined) was 31% in FY 17, the slippage reduced to 21% in FY 18 (CEA, 2016, 2017a, 2018d; Lok Sabha, 2018b ). Therefore, the cumulative shortfall of 7.84 GW (26%) with respect to the cumulative target of 30 GW in the total addition to the generation capacity of wind and solar energy during the last two years must be compensated in the next four years to achieve GOI's target of 175 GW of RE by 2022. Further, analysis of data obtained from Power System Operation Corporation Limited (POSOCO, 2018) indicates the high variability in hydropower and wind power generation on a daily basis at the All-India level even within the same month (see   Figs. 2 and 3 ). The high variability of hydropower and wind energy on one hand and the peak requirement of power after sunset in India on the other hand compound the DISCOMs’ challenges in integrating larger quantities of RE into the Grid unless suitable technical and policy measures are implemented in a timely manner (see  Fig. 4 ). Therefore, India's power sector must overcome the following key challenges to enable the achievement of India's targets related to the NDCs and SDG 7: 4.1 Reduction of DISCOM losses In 2015, GOI launched the ‘UDAY’ scheme to enable the DISCOMs to reduce their interest burden, cost of procured power and Aggregate Technical & Commercial (AT & C) losses (Lok Sabha, 2018c ). This scheme seeks to reduce the gap between the Average Cost of Supply (ACS) and the Average Revenue Realized (ARR) to zero by FY 19 as per defined trajectories to ensure the viability of the DISCOMS. However, more than two years after the introduction of the 'UDAY' scheme, the average of AT & C losses of DISCOMs on an All-India basis has hardly reduced from 20.74% in FY 16 to 18.76% in FY 18, though there is a wide variation in the AT & C losses incurred in various DISCOMs of India (MOP, 2018e; UDAY, 2018 ). In general, the AT & C losses are higher in the DISCOMs of poorer States of India like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar than in the relatively developed States like Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. Since we are already in the middle of FY 19, the DISCOMS will have to ramp up the identified technical and operational measures monitored by UDAY in order to reduce the AT & C losses to 15% by the end of FY 19 as per ‘UDAY’ targets (MOP, 2018e; UDAY, 2018 ). Many of these measures need better governance at the local level as well as more financial assistance from GOI to enable DISCOMS to implement changes like, laying of underground cables (in place of overhead lines) to reduce power theft, upgradation of ‘last mile’ sub-distribution systems, provision of pre-paid meters for rural residential consumers, installation of ‘smart’ meters for industrial and commercial consumers, and separation of rural feeders—all backed by a more effective law and order machinery. The reduction in the interest burden of Government-owned DISCOMs achieved by transferring 75% of their debts to the respective State Governments is primarily responsible for the reduction in the ACS-ARR gap from Rs.0.59/kWh in FY 16 to Rs. 0.40/kWh in FY 17 which has reduced their book losses by approximately Rs.170 Bi (UDAY, 2018 ). More recently, the ACS-ARR gap during the first nine months of FY 18 has further reduced to Rs.0.28/kWh from Rs.0.47/kWh during the corresponding period in FY 17, against the goal of reaching zero by FY 19 (UDAY, 2018 ). Therefore, accelerating the progress of the Government-owned DISCOMs towards financial viability continues to be the biggest challenge that India's power sector has to overcome to help India achieve its SDGs by providing reliable and affordable power to all.  4.2 Poor offtake of power due to uncertainties related to Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) The unprecedented 64% increase in the power generation capacity in India between April 2012 and March 2017, coupled with the lower than expected growth in power demand during the last five years are primarily responsible for the excessive supply-demand mismatch in India's power sector. The supply-demand mismatch coupled with lower prices discovered in solar and wind power auctions has prompted some State-owned DISCOMs to either delay or even decline the signing of Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) for new RE capacity additions (Financial Express, 2017a ).  4.3 Barriers to the growth of off-grid solar energy sources During its submission to the Standing Committee on Energy, MNRE has admitted inter alia that, against a target of 40 GW from solar parks, they have received proposals for solar parks with a total capacity of only 21 GW, and ‘States have not shown interest due to non-availability of land’  (Lok Sabha, 2018b ). However, the total generation capacity of roof-top solar at the end of December 2017 was only 2.1 GW as against the revised target of 40 GW by 2022 (Bridge to India, 2018 ). The key reason for the poor progress of rooftop solar systems till date is the DISCOMs’ anxiety at the prospect of losing a good customer who can minimize his power bills by utilizing the ‘net-metering facility.’ Panagariya and Jain (2017)  have explained how the clean cooking deprivation problem in India (where the number of households without clean cooking fuel is more than twice that without electricity) can be solved faster if GOI incentivizes households in both rural and urban areas to use electricity instead of cooking gas drawn from subsidized cylinders of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) based on costly crude imports. They have estimated that a consumption of 8–10 LPG cylinders (14.2 kg each) per year in each household is equivalent to an electricity consumption of approximately 1400 kWh per year which is 27% higher than India's per capita electricity consumption in 2017. This indicates that promoting the direct use of electricity for cooking is a more cost-effective and self-reliant option for India. Since electricity connections have been provided to nearly 86% of the 177 million rural households in the country, GOI can incentivize the DISCOMs to strengthen their sub-distribution system to enable induction stoves rather than subsidized LPG to be used for cooking (MOP, 2018b ). Further, CEA (2018c)  has stated that the existing CPPs in India can generate an additional 300 TWh of electricity during FY 19. Therefore, CPPs will incur only variable costs to generate the additional power required to provide adequate electricity to all 177 million rural households in India. This will also help to reduce the financial stress faced by several IPPs due to lack of sufficient offtake from the DISCOMs. An off-grid solar system with battery back-up solution may be particularly attractive in the hilly tracts and remote rural areas of India wherever the cost of extending and maintaining the electricity grid may be economically unviable. Since Jhunjhunwala (2018)  has proved the potential of solar DC microgrids to solve the power woes of rural households at much lower costs than conventional alternating current (AC) power systems, GOI must consider promoting the domestic manufacture of DC-powered appliances in addition to incentivizing solar DC microgrids in rural and/or hilly areas. GOI is currently providing a direct cash subsidy of Rs.1600 per LPG connection for eligible households and is also subsidizing LPG cylinders by approximately Rs.300 per cylinder. Therefore, GOI must look at the household energy basket in a holistic manner to provide clean, affordable, and reliable energy to all Indians at an optimal cost.  4.4 Grid Integration and Grid Balancing GOI has recognized that the integration of 175 GW of Renewable Energy (RE) into the National Electricity Grid (Grid) will be challenging due to the intermittent nature of solar and wind energy (MNRE, 2017; Lok Sabha, 2018b ). Therefore, MOP has approved a project comprising inter-State and intra-State transmission systems collectively called ‘Green Energy Corridors (GEC)’ to be completed by 2020 to facilitate the integration of 175 GW of RE (PIB, 2016a ). The inter-State transmission system component of the GEC project involving 3200 circuit kilometers of transmission lines and 18,000 MVA of substation capacity is scheduled to be completed by May 2019 at an approximate cost of Rs.114 Bi. The intra-State transmission system component of the GEC project consisting of 9400 circuit kilometers of transmission lines and 19,000 MVA of substation capacity is being implemented by the respective State utilities at an approved cost of Rs.101 Bi. Further, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has also studied the impact of adding 160 GW of solar and wind energy to the Grid. These studies have indicated the need to implement policies like merit-order based power dispatches at a regional level (in place of the current State-level merit order system) and compensation for ancillary services. These studies have also stressed the need to identify optimal locations for new RE and associated inter- and intra-state transmission systems to integrate 70 GW of solar and wind energy in the RE-rich Southern Region Grid by 2022 as planned (NREL, 2017a, 2017b, 2017c ). The Standing Committee of Parliament on Energy (Standing Committee) after reviewing the progress of the GEC projects, has opined that ‘the target seems unattainable during the remaining period .’ The Standing Committee has recommended that the Ministry ‘should work on a mission mode to get ready the Green Energy Corridor within the stipulated time if they are serious about the Project’  (Lok Sabha, 2018b ). High RE generation also calls for backing down of conventional generators because of the ‘must-run’ status of RE sources in India. The conventional generators also have to be ramped up when RE generation goes down while the power demand is constant or is increasing. The ramp rate of a sub-critical CPP is in the range of 1–1.5% per minute while it is 3% per minute for a super-critical CPP (CEA, 2017b ). Ramp rates for combined cycle (widely used technology for gas-based power in India) gas-based power plants are up to 10% per minute, while that for Hydro-Electric Projects (HEPs) can be as high as 50% per minute. Therefore, hydropower is vital for balancing the grid as well as to meet the peak demand as the proportion of RE ramps up towards GOI's 175 GW target. However, the share of hydropower in India's electricity generation capacity has decreased from 25% in FY 08 to 13.5% in FY 18, while the contribution of hydropower to the total amount of electricity generated by utilities in India has reduced from 17.5% to 10.4% during the same period (CEA, 2008 ; CEA, 2018a ). With the addition of more RE in the Grid, a corresponding increase in hydropower capacity is critical for ensuring grid stability and for meeting the peak demand which generally occurs after sunset in India (Lok Sabha, 2018d ). GOI is considering a proposal to declare all HEPs (irrespective of size) as RE projects. This will enable HEPs which are normally burdened with large gestation periods to receive various concessions and/or assistance from GOI, thereby making hydropower commercially attractive and viable (Lok Sabha, 2018d ). In addition, CEA has recommended construction of balancing facilities in some of the existing HEPs to operate them as Pumped Storage Plants (PSPs) as originally envisaged, since the use of hydro-power is a proven, cost-effective strategy to handle the intermittent and variable power generated by RE sources (CEA, 2018b ). As an alternative to hydro energy, CEA (2018b)  has also recommended enhancing gas supplies to the existing gas-starved power plants for using them as peaking plants due to the high cost of imported liquefied natural gas. Regulators in European countries with a high penetration of RE incentivize the provision of gas-based backup capacity to guarantee grid stability by means of capacity payments to ensure the existence of backup power and security of supply (Goldman Sachs, 2016 ). Such policies can be adopted by India's Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) as the contribution of RE to the Grid increases. Another option for grid balancing is to deploy grid-scale battery storage to handle the intermittency of renewable energy. At the price levels discovered in recent auctions for wind and solar power capacity additions in India, replacing Diesel Generator (DG) sets with RE power-cum-storage plants is desirable from an economic and environmental perspective. In April 2018, GOI-controlled NLC India Limited completed an auction for a 20 MW solar power project integrated with 8 MWh of storage capacity in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands to replace the DG sets used to provide power in these remote islands at competitive prices (PV Tech, 2018 ). In addition, GOI-controlled Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) has recently invited several bids for RE projects with battery storage (Mercom India, 2018 ). However, these projects are still in their infancy since no contracts have been awarded till now. Greater penetration of RE into the Grid also imposes additional costs which have to ultimately borne by the customer either directly or indirectly thereby affecting the affordability of electricity for consumers. For example, the greater the dependence of a grid on solar power, the greater is the distortion of its load curve during the day. As a result, the DISCOMs are forced to pay capacity (idling) charges to conventional generators so that they are available to supply power on demand after sunset. These capacity charges increase the overall power costs for the DISCOMs and contribute to their losses. The additional costs imposed by RE (particularly at elevated levels of RE in the Grid) are mainly due to the following reasons (CEA, 2017b ):• the requirement of keeping standby capacity to supply power on demand when the wind and/or solar power goes down;  • the necessity of having flexible generation which can ramp up and down to compensate for variations in RE power generation;  • the impact on CPPs, in terms of reduction of efficiency and operation at lower Plant Load Factor;  • higher transmission charges on conventional generation to account of lower capacity utilization factor of wind and solar power, and  • the impact on the States Deviation Settlement Mechanism (DSM) charges for inter-State flow of power.    In addition, since 75% of India's electricity is produced by CPPs, the following components of cycling costs for CPPs must be considered before concluding on the grid-parity of RE (CEA, 2017b ):• Increase in maintenance, operation (excluding fixed costs), and capital overhaul expenditures;  • Cost of start-up fuel, auxiliary power, chemicals, and extra manpower for start-ups;  • Cost of Short-Term Efficiency loss;  • Cost of heat rate changes due to low load and variable load operation;  • Cost of long-term heat-rate increases (a part of which is not restored even after overhauling);  • Long-term generation capacity cost increases due to the shortening of plant equipment life;  • Cost of replacement power due to the increased forced outage.    The eight RE-rich States in India (mainly in the Southern and Western regions of India) have to bear all these financial implications even while the RE generated by them is also transmitted to other States through the Grid. CEA has estimated these financial implications to be Rs.1.57/kWh of RE in Tamil Nadu, and Rs.1.45/ kWh in Gujarat. Further, in a bid to enhance the growth of RE projects, GOI has ordered that no inter-state transmission charges and losses will be levied for transmission of electricity generated from RE projects commissioned till March 2022, thereby loading these additional costs onto conventional sources of power (MNRE, 2018c ). However, current RE tariffs do not reveal any information about the true costs of renewables because of extensive subsidies (both implicit and overt) at the Central and State levels as well as due to the strategic behavior by RE power developers. Grover (2018)  has stressed the importance of estimating the system-wide costs of RE by asserting that, ‘to analyze consumer-end grid parity, one will have to add system costs to the plant-level costs, and when so examined, solar and wind are far from achieving grid parity. ’ Therefore, India's CERC and the respective State electricity regulators must undertake techno-economic studies to ascertain the full system cost (including, any overt and/or covert subsidies as well as costs of stranded assets) of electricity supplied by the dispatchable and intermittent (non-dispatchable) energy sources at the point(s) of delivery of electricity to each DISCOM.  4.5 Import dependence and quality assurance The current statutory guidelines for procurement of power from grid-connected Solar PV project mandate that only single part tariff or viability-gap-funding can be used as a bidding parameter during the mandatory auction process (MOP, 2017b ). In order to win contracts in these auctions, solar developers in India are importing more than 90% of their requirement of solar Photovoltaic (PV) panels and modules from China and Malaysia. Specifically, India had imported solar PV cells worth $3.2 Billion during FY 17 of which, about 88% were imported from China (MNRE, 2018d ). Therefore, it is also important to understand the impact of the climatic conditions in some parts of India on the durability of the solar PV modules. In this context, studies on solar (crystalline silicon) PV modules degradation in India carried out by National Centre for Photovoltaic Research and Education (NCPRE) at IIT Bombay and National Institute of Solar Energy (NISE) demonstrate that, amongst modules of similar quality, solar PV modules in:• “Hot” zones are on the average degrading faster than those in the “Non-Hot” zone;  • Roof-mounted systems are degrading faster than those in ground-mounted systems (Chattopadhyay et al., 2016; Dubey et al., 2017; Mahapatra et al., 2017 ).    These studies highlight the importance of periodic assessment of the solar PV modules installed in India. While high-quality modules will perform reasonably well even in hot climates, relatively inferior-quality modules will perform reasonably well in cool climates but fail in hot climates. Some of the large solar parks in India are in ‘Hot’ zones like Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, and Rajasthan (NREL, 2017b ). The higher (compared to BIS/IEC standards and/or manufacturers’ specifications) degradation rates of the solar PV modules installed in the solar power plants located in ‘Hot’ Zones” or on solar rooftops are likely to affect power generation over the 25-year duration of a PPA, unless these solar PV modules are replaced at suitable intervals depending on the actual degradation rates of the solar PV modules. Therefore, assessment of the initial quality, as well as the long-term performance of solar PV modules through audits at the time of installation and at regular intervals thereafter is necessary to ensure that the projections of solar energy required to meet India's growing needs for RE are satisfied, now and in the future. In the wake of India being flooded by cheap, imported modules of questionable quality, MNRE has mandated quality standards for all solar equipment to minimize the future entry of substandard solar power equipment into India (NISE, 2017 ). MNRE has directed all sellers and manufacturers of major solar equipment to get their products registered with the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). The Indian standards, which are now applicable from April 2018 onwards, encapsulate all the critical technical requirements in the IEC standards (Business World, 2017; MNRE, 2018e ). Coupled with additional mandates like, in-country testing, periodic monitoring by BIS, and periodic surveillance, the new regulations are motivated by GOI's concern about substandard equipment which has been flooding the Indian market. However, domestic solar PV modules are not competitively priced as compared to imported modules (Bridge to India, 2018 ). Therefore, from 30 July 2018 onwards, MOF (2018b)  has imposed a safeguard duty of 25% on the import of solar PV cells for one year, followed by 20% for the next six months and 15% for another six months. This duty was imposed since these imports were causing ‘serious injury’ to domestic solar panel manufacturers, even though solar power tariffs are expected to increase as a result. Now that domestic manufacturers have been given a level playing field, they must ramp up their manufacturing capacity to meet the solar energy targets set by MNRE.  4.6 Delays in nuclear power plants (NPPs) While nuclear power has lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions comparable to renewables, India's nuclear program has been stymied by the shortage of fuel as well as delays in construction. After the civil nuclear cooperation agreement between India and the United States was signed in 2008, India has been importing uranium fuel from countries like Canada, France, Kazakhstan, and Russia to meet the requirements of its NPPs under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards (DAE, 2018a ). Long-term studies conducted in and around NPP sites in India before and after the establishment of these NPPs have established that there is negligible change in radioactivity and radiation levels in the environment due to the operation of NPPs (DAE, 2018b ). In addition, long-term epidemiological surveys for health assessment of employees (and their families) working in the NPPs have also established that there are no adverse effects of these NPPs on the people living in and around the plants (DAE, 2018b ). With the resolution of uranium supplies, GOI has accorded financial sanction for 12 NPPs with a total capacity of 9000 MW in addition to nine other NPPs with a total capacity of 6700 MW at various stages of construction (DAE, 2018c ). These 12 additional NPPs are expected to be commissioned by 2031 while the under-construction NPPs are slated for commissioning by 2025 (DAE, 2018c ). Further, GOI is also engaged in discussions with the French and American Governments to set up NPPs with Light Water Reactors (LWRs) at two different sites. NPPs are capital-intensive projects and have relatively low variable costs compared to CPPs. Therefore, NPPs in India are operated at steady and continuous full-rated power, except when it is necessary to reduce power or to shut down for maintenance and refueling, or for other operational or safety reasons. However, the share of electricity from RE sources in the Southern region of India is projected to increase from the FY 18 level of 14% to 38–40% in 2022 when the total installed capacity of solar and wind energy in this region increases from 30 GW in June 2018 to 70 GW in 2022 (MNRE, 2018f, 2018g; MOP, 2018a; NREL, 2017c ). NREL (2017c)  has therefore projected the need for higher flexibility in conventional power plants to avoid curtailment of RE particularly during the daytime in monsoon months. NREL (2017c)  has projected that the Plant Load Factors (PLFs) of CPPs in the Southern Region will decrease from 64% to 43% when the RE penetration in this region crosses 38% of the total load. At this low PLF, many CPPs in the Southern Region will become unviable not only due to the extra costs of cycling as indicated in subsection 4.4 of this article but also due to the high landed cost of coal in the CPPs of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu which get their coal from distant locations. Therefore, GOI must not only enhance and expedite the construction of NPPs in the Southern Region but also ensure that LWRs installed here are capable of flexible operation which is prevalent in NPPs abroad (IAEA, 2018 ). This will enable NPPs to replace high-cost base load CPPs in the Southern Region thereby lowering the overall electricity tariffs as well as particulate and gaseous emissions. This strategy will also help achieve India's targets under SDG 7 and the NDCs. Further, in order to realize the ambitious growth projections for atomic energy in India, India's Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) must be upgraded to an independent authority under the Atomic Energy Commission (Indian Express, 2017a ). Therefore, GOI is considering the setting up a Nuclear Safety Regulatory Authority in order to convert the functional independence of the AERB into de jure  independence in order to enhance public confidence regarding the safety of NPPs in India (DAE, 2018d ).  4.7 Access to low-cost global finance The UNFCCC clearly lays down that the principles of Equity and Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities should guide climate actions. These principles have also been embedded in the Paris Agreement, wherein the developed countries have committed to mobilize $100 billion per year for a Green Climate Fund (GCF), with the intention to enhance it beyond $100 billion per year by 2025 (MOEFandCC, 2017b ). As of 20 April 2018, donor countries have pledged contributions amounting to only $10.2 billion (GCF, 2018a ). It was only in February 2018 that the GCF sanctioned a loan of $100 million for its first project in India with a capacity of only 250 MW over five years (GCF, 2018b ). GOI has already committed to infusing the necessary capital into India's Public Sector Banks (PSBs) which are having the major chunk of Rs.1.77 Trillion of debt borne by 34 stressed power projects (Lok Sabha, 2018a ). Further, enhancing the RE generation capacity from 69 GW in March 2018 to 175 GW by 2022 requires an investment of about Rs.5–6 Trillion in addition to the investments required to connect the incremental renewable energy sources to the Grid (Lok Sabha, 2018b ). Therefore, accessing adequate funds from the GCF is critical for India to accelerate its progress towards the achievement of its NDCs as per the Paris Agreement.   5 Clean coal technologies to enhance environmental compliance of CPPs While India continues to pursue its ambitious targets related to expansion of RE sources, the intermittent nature of solar and wind energy, inadequate availability of gas, and the endemic delays in constructing hydel and nuclear power plants due to issues related to land acquisition coupled with the energy security provided by CPPs based on domestic coal, together indicate that coal will continue to play an important role in achieving the goals set out in the PFA program (MOP, 2018d ). Between FY 12 and FY 17, India's power sector has expanded largely on the basis of coal-based capacity additions fueled by domestic coal supplies (CEA, 2018b ). ‘Clean coal' technologies reduce the environmental impact of coal-power generation by using coal more efficiently or by removing undesirable pollutants after combustion. Clean coal technologies include washing of coal to reduce its ash content, use of more efficient Super-Critical (SC) or Ultra-Super Critical (USC) technologies, as well as utilization of flue gas clean-up processes like flue gas desulphurization and denitrification. GOI-controlled Coal India Ltd. (CIL) which produces 84% of India's coal production has planned to set up nine new non-coking coal washeries with a total capacity of 75 MT by 2020. CIL must not only expedite these washeries but must also increase its washery capacity urgently to ensure the supply of coal with an ash content of less than 34% to all CPPs located at distances exceeding 500 km from their coal source as per Law (Lok Sabha, 2018e ). GOI has mandated the use of SC technology in CPPs from April 2017 onwards to increase the efficiency of CPPs thereby reducing specific coal consumption and CO2 emissions (CEA, 2018b ). The direct benefit of increasing the use of SC technology in India is also reflected in the decline in specific coal consumption of CPPs from 0.69 kg per kWh in FY 14 to 0.63 kg per kWh in FY 17 (PIB, 2017 ). NTPC (India's largest power company) has also adopted USC technology in its Khargone CPP which will be commissioned next year (MOP, 2018d ). The design efficiency of a CPP using USC technology is 1.5% higher than that of a CPP with SC technology which in turn is 5% more efficient than the sub-critical technology that powers most CPPs in India (MOP, 2017a, 2018d ). Further, use of Advanced Ultra-Super-Critical (AUSC) technology in CPPs will result in a 20% reduction in CO2  emission at source combined with a 20% saving in coal consumption compared to a sub-critical CPP (PIB, 2016b ). Construction of India's first AUSC CPP with a capacity of 800 MW based on indigenous R & D will commence in 2019 (Business Standard, 2018 ). Continued growth in particulate and gaseous emissions will adversely affect more people and further exacerbate morbidity and mortality (Greenpeace India, 2017 ). On 07 December 2015, Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MOEF&CC) notified the Environment (Protection) Amendment Rules, 2015 (EPAR), aimed at reducing particulate and gaseous emissions from CPPs while minimizing fresh-water consumption (MOP, 2018f ). To comply with EPAR, most of the existing CPPs in India have to retrofit, high-efficiency Electrostatic Precipitators (ESPs) to control particulate emission, Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD) systems to limit SO2  emissions, and a combination of combustion and post-combustion technologies to control NOx emissions (MOP, 2018f ). CEA has recently drafted a schedule for installation of FGDs in 414 CPPs and for modernization of ESPs in 222 CPPs by 2022 (MOP, 2018g ). GOI has submitted this schedule to the Supreme Court of India (SCI) even though the original deadline for implementation of EPAR has expired on 7 December 2017 (Down-to-Earth, 2017b; EPCA, 2018a, 2018b; Sethi, 2018 ). The SCI in its Order dated 25 July 2018 has criticized GOI for its inaction in this matter by observing that, ‘on a closer reading of the affidavit filed by the Union of India, it is clear that the deadline of 2022 cannot be reached by the Union of India and is completely illusory in nature .’ Further, the SCI has ordered, ‘Since the matter is of concern, we expect the Union of India through the Ministry of Power and the Ministry of Environment to take the matter seriously since it relates to the health of millions of people in the country’  (Mehta, M.C. versus Union of India and Others, 2018 ). In this regard, India has much to learn from China's power sector which has succeeded in reducing SO2  emissions by promoting the installation of FGD systems in its CPPs so effectively that, between 2006 and 2010, FGD penetration in Chinese CPPs increased from 30% to 87% of all CPPs required to be fitted with FGDs (Singh, 2017 ). A recent study by NASA indicates that, between 2005 and 2016, total SO2  emissions in China have declined by 75% while those in India have increased by 50%, bringing SO2  emissions from India to the same level as China. If this trend is allowed to continue, India will emit significantly more SO2  than China in the coming years, despite China generating more than four times the quantum of electrical energy generated in India in 2016 (BP, 2018b ; Li Can et al., 2017 ). China's success in enhancing the environmental performance of CPPs holds crucial lessons for India since GOI is struggling to control the SO2  emissions mandated by the EPAR, even after a notice period of two years. Rather, it is widely reported that MOP has informed the MOEF&CC that, ‘19,994 MW capacity is either not having space or is not interested to install FGD systems  (Indian Express, 2017b ).’ Such CPPs must be included in the list of CPPs with a capacity of 48 GW (out of a total CPP capacity of 197 GW operated by utilities today) which will be progressively retired before 2027 and replaced with CPPs using more efficient SC/USC/AUSC technology that can comply with EPAR (MOP, 2018d ). For example, GOI-controlled NTPC is replacing its obsolete, inefficient, and non-compliant CPPs with new CPPs based on SC/USC technology which will be equipped with environment-friendly features like, high-efficiency airborne dust control systems and SOx and NOx emission controls to comply with EPAR, as well as dry-ash disposal and zero liquid discharge systems (NTPC, 2017 ). Since 22 June 2010, GOI has been levying a carbon tax in the name of ‘Clean Energy Cess’ on all coal and lignite used in India, whether by domestic production or through imports. The funds collected from this cess were originally earmarked for the purposes of financing and promoting clean energy initiatives, including ‘projects which result in replacing existing technology in energy generation with a more environmentally sustainable approach ,’ through the ‘National Clean Energy Fund’ (DOE, 2011 ). This cess was initially levied @ Rs.50 per ton of coal used in India and has been doubled three times since June 2014 to its current rate of Rs.400 per ton from 1 March 2016 onwards (DOE, 2018 ) after GOI renamed it as ‘Clean Environment Cess.’ Consequently, the National Clean Energy Fund was also renamed as the National Clean Energy and Environment Fund (NCEEF) in 2016 (DOE, 2018 ). MNRE has utilized most of the Rs.214 billion it has received from the NCEEF to promote RE capacity additions (Lok Sabha, 2018b ). CERC has held that GOI's imposition of the Clean Energy/Environment Cess (Cess) constitutes a ‘Change of Law’ in all Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) entered into by CPPs under the Electricity Act (CERC, 2017, 2018 ). Therefore, CPPs have raised their tariffs to pass on the cost of this Cess to all power consumers as per the terms of their PPA. However, in a perverse move, GOI has subsumed this Cess into the GST Compensation Fund from 1 July 2017 onwards and has declared that the money received by levying this Cess from this date onwards will not be used to fund the NCEF (MLJ, 2017; MOF, 2018c ). Given that coal-based power will remain central to India's electricity supply, it is critical for GOI to reduce the power sector's environmental footprint by extending concessional finance to CPPs for retrofitting their plants to comply with EPAR (CSE, 2017; MOP, 2018f ). This will avoid double taxation of Indians to just to enable them to realize their Fundamental Right to a clean environment since the entire burden of this Cess is already being passed through to all power consumers in the form of higher tariffs.  6 Enhancement of carbon sink As an integral part of its NDCs, GOI has committed to creating an additional carbon sink of 2.5–3 billion tons of CO2  equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. The National Forest Policy (NFP) aims for 33% forest cover in the country (MOEFandCC, 2015 ). As one of the enablers to achieve this goal, Parliament enacted the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Act of 2016 (MLJ, 2016b ). However, vast sums of money totaling to more than Rs.420 billion (‘CAMPA funds’) paid by user agencies to the State forest departments as compensation for forest lands diverted by them for non-forest use were lying unutilized for years due to the absence of a permanent mechanism to utilize these funds (Economic Times, 2017 ). A High-Level Committee (HLC) appointed by GOI has pointed out the need to increase the capacity of the Forest department in the States to ensure effective utilization of CAMPA funds needed to achieve NFP's prime goal. This will also help to enhance the capacity of India's carbon sink as per the NDCs (MOEFandCC, 2014; MNRE, 2017 ).  7 Conclusions and policy recommendations While the international community recognizes the progress made by India towards a cleaner energy mix (IEA, 2017b ), the following key recommendations are proposed for implementation by GOI to accelerate India's progress towards a low-carbon economy while simultaneously achieving the targets related to SDG 7 which is linked to several other SDGs.• GOI must work closely with States to increase offtake of power by DISCOMs which can be sustained only when the DISCOMs reduce their ACS-ARR gap to zero as per the trajectory agreed to by each State even as they extend electrification to the hitherto unelectrified households. For this to happen, DISCOMs must ramp up the pace of reduction in their AT & C losses by implementing the operational improvements envisaged in the ‘UDAY’ scheme.  • MOP must expedite the commissioning of all necessary transmission and distribution infrastructure (including the Green Energy Corridors) since these projects have longer gestation periods than those related to solar or wind energy generation projects.  • GOI must work with DISCOMs to develop and implement a more user-friendly rooftop solar policy. In particular, GOI must enhance financial support to off-grid solar and wind energy projects in the rural and remote areas of India where grid power has either not reached or is not reliable. Such off-grid power systems will also open better self-employment opportunities in rural and remote areas thereby promoting inclusive growth which is key to sustainable development.  • GOI must consider the provision of Aadhaar-based direct-benefit subsidies to eligible households for consuming electricity in place of LPG for cooking while the last-mile distribution system is strengthened to enable the use of electrical appliances for cooking.  • GOI must incentivize the States to construct balancing facilities in some of the existing large hydro plants to operate them as PSPs since the use of PSPs is a proven, cost-effective strategy to handle the intermittent and variable power generated by RE sources.  • Unlike solar power which has hardly crossed 22% of its 2022 target for installed capacity (100 GW) by March 2018, wind power has already exceeded 56% of its 2022 target (60 GW). India has an established manufacturing base in wind power equipment unlike in solar equipment. Therefore, GOI must examine the option of switching the targets between wind and solar energy while encouraging wind-solar hybrid projects as well (Lok Sabha, 2018b; MNRE, 2018h ; NREL, 2017a ).  • Due to the multiple reasons explained in this article, coal has to continue to meet India's base load requirements. The increase in power generation from existing CPPs due to the incremental power demand from hitherto unelectrified/under-served rural households will also reduce the overall cost of generation by spreading fixed costs of CPPs over the larger quantum of electricity generated. Therefore, GOI must extend concessional finance to all CPPs identified by CEA for retrofitting their units to comply with EPAR in a timely manner.  • CIL must enhance its total washery capacity expeditiously to supply coal containing less than 34% ash to all CPPs located more than 500 km from their coal source.  • The current level of stressed power assets is a cause of concern for India (MOP, 2018g ). The ‘twin balance sheet' problem faced by India's power sector and GOI-controlled banks requires policymakers to include the costs of stranded CPPs with other social costs of renewables. Therefore, MOP must review its current practice of funding greenfield TPPs when India is already suffering from stressed power generation assets, more so when RE sources are expanding rapidly.  • Nuclear power is a safe, environment-friendly technology which is well-established in India. While NPPs can generate power on a 24 × 7 basis unlike solar and wind energy sources, they are expected to generate only 5% of the total electricity generated by utilities in India during FY 27 (MOP, 2018d ). GOI must expedite the construction of NPPs (preferably equipped with LWRs) in time to replace CPPs saddled with high coal costs and low PLFs in the Southern Region when the capacity of intermittent renewable energy progressively increases to 70 GW by 2022 as per GOI's targets.  • The importance of increasing the forest and tree cover in India to achieve the NDCs cannot be understated. Therefore, GOI must implement the HLC's recommendations and also enhance the capacity of environmental regulators to make the regulatory processes more effective.  • As RE generation increases, India's CERC and the respective SERCs in each State must take steps to ascertain the full system cost of electricity supplied by the dispatchable and intermittent (non-dispatchable) energy sources at the point(s) of delivery of electricity to each DISCOM. These studies will enable the regulators to take appropriate decisions regarding the optimal energy mix in each State at various time horizons, so that capacity planning in the complex, capital-intensive, and critical power sector can be done in an efficient and transparent manner.  • The administrative and financial implications of the ongoing transition to a low-carbon economy for India must be addressed in a spirit of cooperative and competitive federalism by the Central and State Governments (Ghosh et al., 2017 ).  • Finally, GOI must also give greater thrust on accessing adequate funds from the GCF as committed in the Paris Agreement to accelerate India's progress towards the achievement of its NDCs.
