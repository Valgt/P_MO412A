                  The approach to integrate a fourth-party logistics service provider in the German Agricultural Bulk Logistics sector marks a new concept that aims at achieving sustainable development goals in transportation, i. e., by realising full truck loads. Against the background of steadily growing transport volumes, it is of paramount importance to develop sustainability concepts in order to mitigate the impacts on the environment. At present, the processes in the domain of the German Agricultural Bulk Logistics sector are characterised by bulk transports, small and medium sized actors and paper-based processes, which offers high potential for process optimizations in terms of sustainability. Therefore, the German Agricultural Bulk Logistics sector currently explores the approach of including a fourth-party logistics service provider into its transport processes in order to render these more sustainable and reduce costs. The objective of this paper is to present the general idea of implementing a fourth-party logistics service provider into a transportation (planning) process, to clarify the different functions of the participating parties and to introduce the modified transportation planning process as artefact. By means of a mixed method approach, we deliver qualitative insights based on semi-structured interviews and quantitative insights based on simulations. Effects and benefits of the approach are identified by means of a case study. Involving the fourth-party logistics service provider as well as the associated transportation planning process in the mentioned logistics area can lead to cost savings up to 38%, helps to reduce environmental pollution and mitigates social barriers in form of existential fears. The results demonstrate the applicability of the fourth-party logistics service provider approach in the sector and underline that this approach supports the achievement of sustainable development goals in transportation. Furthermore, we identify sustainable characteristics and present the mixed method approach which functions as an assessment framework for the fourth-party logistics service provider approach. Furthermore, by adopting the documented features of sustainable supply chain management in the fourth-party logistics service provider approach, an additional value is generated.

This comprises all involved production steps and processes such as dispatch and transportation as well as the distribution of food (Ahumada and Villalobos, 2009; Beske et al., 2014; Trienekens and Zuurbier, 2008 ). At the same time the demand for safe and sustainable products of high quality is increasing (van der Vorst et al., 2009 ). Transportation plays a central role in the sustainability of a product from the beginning of the harvesting process to its delivery to the consumer (Konieczny et al., 2013 ). From an economic point of view transportation has to meet the six main objectives of logistics: deliver the right product, at the right time, at the right location, in the right quantity, with the right quality and for the right price (Seeck, 2010 ). At the same time transportation should be performed in an ecologically sensitive manner in order to reduce environmental impacts. Furthermore, transportation should consider social aspects of sustainability including the interests of all involved actors (Ciliberti et al., 2008 ). Initial shipment from the harvesting fields to the warehouse stage, as well as to processing companies, is done in the form of bulk goods transport. The annual volume transported by the agricultural sector in Germany is approximately 3,595,373,000 tonnes, of which 76% (2.8 billion tonnes) are shipped by commercial road transport, 90% of which is inland transportation (Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection, 2012 ). As a further example, the agricultural sector in the US transports 512,000,000 tonnes of grain per year: 60% of this by road transport, 28% by rail and 12% by water (Association of American Railroads (2013 )). In light of enormous global shipping turnover as well as the growing and accelerating pace of trade, business logistics increasingly becomes the focus of transactions among traders, consigners, consignees and producers. This results in new challenges for planning, transactions and the management of transportation. Presently, the agricultural supply chain still has efficiency optimisation options (Beske et al., 2014; Fischer, 2013; Grimm et al., 2014 ). The main difference between agricultural supply chains and other supply chains is the permanent modification of goods from the harvest to the processing stage (Ahumada and Villalobos, 2009 ). Furthermore, the harvesting process is exposed to fluctuating weather conditions, which may result in limited time slots for transportation (Ahumada and Villalobos, 2009 ). Hence the harvesting period may be a special challenge for transporting and distributing agricultural bulk goods. Frequently, these goods are shipped to warehouses or processing companies. Throughout the year both storage levels and import and export volumes of goods are transported. Transportation therefore requires short planning horizons, especially for the transport of harvested crops (1–4 h) and for the year-round supply for processing. Import and export volumes and long-term scheduled demands of the industry can be handled by longer planning horizons (8–80 h). As in the agricultural sector, the margins of the logistics sector are small (Lowe and Preckel, 2004 ). Moreover, the logistics sector has to cope with challenges such as haulage, transport time, flexibility, quality, sustainability and reliability in general (Islam et al., 2013 ). For instance, the consequences of growing traffic volumes are a decrease in the profitability of shipments as a result of traffic jams, increased time for transportation and a decrease in the reliability of deliveries (Golob and Regan, 2002 ). Furthermore, transportation costs increase due to steadily increasing fuel prices, toll charges and anticipated duties (Green, 2014 ). The dominance of road transportation has a negative impact factor for CO2  emissions and thus for sustainability in general (Abbasi and Nilsson, 2012 ). Although cooperative production methods are not uncommon within the agricultural sector, cooperative approaches such as transportation networks are rarely implemented in the agricultural bulk logistics sector (Salleh et al., 2009 ). The aforementioned problems of the sector demonstrate the need for solutions that may be implemented through various approaches. The transportation sector contributes 14% of global CO2  emissions as a result of the means of transportation including road, rail, air and (marine) navigation (EEA, 2012, 2014 ). Alternative approaches are the development of intermodal transportation (Macharis and Bontekoning, 2004 ) or truck sharing (Islam and Olsen, 2014 ). However, this requires cooperation and a minimum degree of collaboration of all involved actors. Dekker et al. (2012)  demonstrate the added value as a result of increased efficiency as well as CO2  reduction due to intelligent planning of the supply chain including the related transportation. They, furthermore, describe measures such as pricing, supply chain planning as well as strategic and operative decision support within the field of supply chains. The transportation segment has a high potential of improvement in terms of procurement, production concept, distribution of production facilities, means of transportation, routing, and transit time as well as various transportation concepts (Dekker et al., 2012; Schönberger and Kopfer, 2009 ). One option to provide a planning and service instance for the supply chain is the introduction of the 4PL approach (Vinay et al., 2009 ). This article focusses an investigation of the 4PL approach within the agricultural bulk logistics sector to improve sustainability in transportation. While the 4PL approach is implemented in practice, a scientific discussion about the effects and benefits is missing. The target of a 4PL as a superordinated planning agent within a supply chain is a significant reduction in resource use, thus contributing to a more sustainable transportation sector. The 4PL operates as a network integrator within a given supply chain. Its objective is to employ involved actors and available resources efficiently; therefore processes and information and communication technology are needed. Based on previous research, transportation planning could be identified as the main function of a 4PL in the agriculture bulk logistics (Own source). As a consequence the 4PL transportation planning process is presented and assessed by sustainable characteristics. For the assessment a mixed method approach together with the insights of the case study is followed. Semi-structured interviews and simulations of the business process and of the route planning process allow a scientific and practical assessment. These results can be applied as decision support for the 4PL approach. Using this mixed method approach, we answer the following research questions: RQ 1: How can the transportation planning process (with an integrated route planning) for the 4PL be designed?  RQ 2: What is the added and sustainable value of the 4PL approach in the agricultural bulk logistics sector?  Our literature search could not detect any significant scientific activities on the application of a 4PL with a focus on transportation planning in the agricultural bulk logistics sector. Such a research effort requires the involvement of all relevant actors including their potential to increase efficiency for a successful implementation. The objective is to show the effects for transportation planning taking into account the specific requirements of the sector, the available calculation time and the cost savings. Furthermore, the results have consequences for the sustainability of the operation, which should be delineated. This article is structured as follows: Section 2  provides a delineation of the 4PL. Section 3  introduces sustainability characteristics. The research methods are discussed in Section 4 , and Section 5  describes the application of the methods. The results are presented in Section 6 . The article is concluded with a discussion of the results in Section 7  and a summary in Section 8 .  2 Fourth party logistics provider (4PL) A 4PL is a neutral provider of various services within the supply chain. This provider does not supply assets but endeavours to utilise all provided resources efficiently and sustainably while integrating all involved actors (Hingley et al., 2011; Mukhopadhyay and Setaputra, 2006; Win, 2008 ). One objective of the 4PL is to minimise individual inefficiencies and, at the same time, increase the efficiency of the entire actor network. The main task is to plan both the supply chain process and transportation. This planning is accomplished by employing IT networking and platforms (Mammitzsch and Francyk, 2012 ). Therefore, industry-specific exigencies must be taken into account, and corresponding knowledge is required (Bourlakis and Bourlakis, 2005 ). Thus, in the context of bulk logistics, it is indispensable to have a sound knowledge of the structures and circumstances in this domain. Therefore, the potential for the increase of efficiency and resources conservation must be examined, and actors must be involved in the process in order to generate win–win situations (Hingley et al., 2011 ). Fig. 1   describes the actors under the supply chain approach in the current situation together with the idea of the 4PL approach in the target situation. Based on the material flow the involved actors (producer, primary cooperative, agricultural trade, freight carrier, processors and secondary cooperative) are presented together with the information flows. Thereby, a farmer, who generates bulk goods, is designated as producer. After the harvest, primary cooperatives or agricultural trades buy up the goods which entails corresponding transports. The secondary cooperative then bundles the harvested goods based on information from the primary cooperative and agricultural trade. A processor has a demand for bulk goods as his role is to produce food products or animal feed. As a result, a commercial transaction between the secondary cooperative, the primary cooperative or agricultural trade arises, in the course of which transport orders are generated for the freight carriers. The secondary cooperative instructs freight carriers with the transport, whereas the primary cooperative and the agricultural trade have their own transport resources. Every actor tries to use the transport resources efficiently, but based on the existing distribution planning and the implemented information flow a structured optimization is virtually impossible. In this context, the experts interviewed estimated that there is an empty mileage (i.e. mileage by empty trucks returning to their home base or by empty trucks repositioning to pick up their next load) volume of approximately up to 90%. The advantage of the 4PL approach is that the empty mileage can be reduced by means of a systematic bundling of transport volumes and a larger planning (data) base. The 4PL approach represents a centralized planning, distribution and management organisation for a network of multiple actors, which enables those actors who have transport resources to minimize their empty mileage (Hingley et al., 2011 ). Moreover, each of the involved actors is in a position to minimize his respective inefficiencies (Win, 2008 ). In our case, shorter distances to the next loading point are computable. The effective use of information and communication technologies (ICT) supports the 4PL based supply chain management (Zhang et al., 2011 ). For a better understanding of the process, the different process phases are presented in Fig. 1 . The black arrows show the information flows between the actors in the current situation. The grey arrows show the information flows with the idea of a 4PL approach. The actual information flows are based on expert interviews. The data were acquired between February 2014 and May 2014. The authors interviewed eleven experts in the sector, so that each actor has been interviewed. From the findings, the information flows could be derived. The desired information flows were generated by the authors based from the findings of the literature (Hingley et al., 2011; Win, 2008 ) and after explaining the 4PL approach in the context of the interviews.  3 Sustainability and process characteristics For an implementation of a 4PL as an intermediary in a network, sustainability characteristics are of particular relevance. Based on Elkington (2000)  the objective is to estimate the added value that a company creates economically, ecologically and socially (Govindan et al., 2013; Nikolaou et al., 2013 ). One requirement for a successful 4PL approach will be to incorporate the actors of a transport network, and to enable an improvement in logistics performance. Based on the added value, disadvantages of uncoordinated actors' activities (waiting times, empty runs, high fuel consumption, low capacity utilization) can be minimized. A 4PL can generate a profitable contribution if a resource efficiency of the resources of the network actors can be provided. Therefore, the three characteristics (economic, ecological and social) can support the assessment: 3.1 Economic challenge Following Govindan et al. (2013) , the economic criteria can be collected from multiple reviews that focus on an economic supplier selection (Boer de et al., 2001; Ho et al., 2010; Huang and Keskar, 2007 ). Furthermore, economic outcomes like financial benefits have to be identified (Eltayeb et al., 2011 ). Adapting this insight to the challenge of a 4PL approach, the listed criteria (Govindan et al., 2013 ) can be specified. These are costs, delivery reliability, quality assurance and technological capability. Costs are divided into: production costs, order costs and logistics costs. Production costs (EC1) are defined by the price paid for processing a shipment. The order costs (EC2) include the costs invoiced in the form of planning effort by the 4PL. Logistics costs (EC3) include all costs generated for the physical transport. The challenge of a 4PL is to minimize the sum of all costs with intelligent planning. The delivery reliability consists of the sub criteria ‘lead time’ and ‘on time delivery’. The lead time (EC4) depends on the time between placement and arrival of an order. On time delivery (EC5) describes the ability to follow the defined delivery schedule or transport plan. The quality criteria can be divided in quality assurance and rejection ratio. Quality assurance (EC6), especially in the food sector, is important because only certified vehicles and actors can be employed for the transport process. The rejection ratio (EC7) shows the number of rejected materials by the quality control of the processors. The technological capability includes the sub criteria technology level, capability of development and design. First of all, the 4PL has to implement a technology infrastructure within the actor network (EC8). Another challenge is the development and design of future services (EC9) under the assumption of customer and supplier requirements (EC9).  3.2 Ecological challenge The ecological challenge for a selection of a green supplier (Govindan et al., 2013 ) is documented by systems and methods that integrate sustainability in supply chains (Bai and Sarkis, 2010; Kuo et al., 2010 ). Furthermore, frameworks are described that follow an evaluation (Nikolaou et al., 2013; Tseng and Chiu, 2013 ). In addition, examples and activities like ecodesign, green purchasing, reverse logistics, collaboration of suppliers on environmental matters, and the implementation of environmental management systems into suppliers' organizational structures are described (Eltayeb et al., 2011 ). Based on these insights and the identified criteria of Govindan et al. (2013) , the ecological challenges for the 4PL approach can be divided into pollution production/reduction, resource consumption, eco-design and environmental management system. Pollution production/reduction (EO1) describes the average air emissions, waste water, solid wastes and harmful materials produced or minimized by the 4PL approach. Resources consumption (EO2) refers to the consumption of energy. Eco design (EO3) represents the activity to generate services for reducing the consumption of energy and waste. The last ecological challenge for the 4PL approach is the implementation of an environmental management system (EO4) for the sector in collaboration with the actors of the network.  3.3 Social challenge Following the idea to define sustainability characteristics for the 4PL approach, there is a third dimension: the social challenge (Bai and Sarkis, 2010; Nikolaou et al., 2013 ). In this connection, the social responsibilities that stakeholders, consumers, non-governmental organizations and companies carry, are described. The idea is to sensitize all participating business partners to a socially and environmentally friendly behaviour and thus to create a general code of conduct to that effect (Ciliberti et al., 2011 ). In consideration of Govindan et al. (2013) , the social measures of the 4PL approach comprise internal and external social measures. Internal social measures are good employment and labour practices as well as occupational health and safety. External social measures can be classified as the influences from the outside, thus from the logistics sector and the contractual stakeholders. The measures in the domain of the 4PL approach can be supplemented as follows: There are various kinds of working models that can render employment practices (SC1) social, e.g., flexible working hours and homeworking. Besides, due to the digitization that is associated with the 4PL approach, also the requirements on employees are increased and necessitate an adaption of the working conditions. And also the communication level changes with the digitization, as most of the processes now are computer-based. The internal health and safety (SC2) aspects may be neglected because the focus is on planning and tracking services. Nevertheless, freight transports have to be processed in accordance with occupational safety and health regulations. The influence of the sector (SC3) comprises: service infrastructure, cultural assets, economic welfare and further expansion of the 4PL approach within the actor network. In addition, higher degrees of cooperation as well as an intensive communication with the 4PL and among the actors of the network are required. This may involve the introduction of reliable partnerships or alliances among network actors. The influence of contractual stakeholders (SC4) has a significant impact on the success of the 4PL approach, because the 4PL actor does not have own assets, such as trucks. Partnerships among actors including the 4PL require norms and procurement standards to ensure an effective employment of a 4PL within an actor network.  3.4 4PL transportation planning process One main benefit of the 4PL approach is the application of a comprehensive and integrated transportation planning process (according to DIN 66001) as depicted in Fig. 2  . Based on the requirements of the sector, a 4PL transportation planning process was designed by the authors. The design is based on transport order processing from the literature considering (e.g. Flender, 2010 ) the 4PL approach. The first step of the process is the collection of transport orders (TO) from the network. Based on a summary of transport orders the transportation concept planning is ready to start. At this point, transport routes are calculated considering the economic, ecological and social requirements. A transport route depends on a number of 2–10 TO within a time frame of a week. Each TO is planned exactly. Thereafter, the carriers are selected out of a data base by means of general or special agreements as negotiated among the actors. But also optimization parameters, such as the shortest path to a loading place, are considered. If the data base does not identify an available transport capacity, a respective request in form of a transport offer is initiated and submitted to further carriers. This can also be required in case the price and time are not appropriate for the carrier, or in case the offer is not accepted by the customer. As far as price and time are verified by the carrier, the carrier is then enabled to deliver the assigned route. Following the carrier's conformation, the 4PL generates a transport offer for the customer and for each TO. If all customers accept the offer, the transportation order follows from the carrier, and the transport order will be implemented in the transportation planning. If the customer doesn't accept the offer, a modification loop in the form of time or price revisions follows. If the delivery date is scheduled, a final transportation route for each of the carriers is generated incorporating the same parameters as in the transport concept planning. For this route a transport order contract is issued, and all actors are informed. The transport process starts, and is controlled and tracked by the 4PL until the payment process is finished. Following the 4PL transportation planning process according to the economic, ecological and social challenges of the added value of the 4PL approach, each process step has to be considered and checked in form of the improvement potential and the changes. Furthermore, the process steps have the potential to improve sustainability. However this requires the involvement of all actors in relevant process steps in order to contribute to the 4PL transportation planning process. In the next section we examine the 4PL approach including the 4PL planning process according to the research methods provided.   4 Research methods This research effort applies a mixed methods research approach. Based upon the unstated premise of applied science with practical relevance, both quantitative and qualitative research methods and data are employed (Recker, 2013; Venkatesh et al., 2013 ). The mixed methods approach has the ability to address the confirmatory (RQ2) and exploratory research questions (RQ1). Both qualitative and quantitative methods can arguably be used to address similar research questions, qualitative methods have typically been used more in IS and other social sciences for exploratory research in order to develop a deep understanding of a phenomenon. The 4PL approach comprises a mix of economical (e.g., resource efficiency), technological (e.g., applied IS/IT, digital transformation of processes (4PL process)), ecological (e.g., reverse logistics) and social aspects. The social aspects within the 4PL approach aim to manage people and to establish a set of values or principles that encourage organizations to act in a responsible manner. The mixed methods research can leverage the complementary strengths and non-overlapping weaknesses of qualitative and quantitative methods. Furthermore, it enables insights that none of the methods could offer when applied alone (Johnson and Turner, 2003 ). Only the combination of methods allows to offset the disadvantages that certain methods involve can be offset (Greene and Caracelli, 1997 ). The semi-structured interviews (qualitative data collection approach) allowed us to gain deep insights from comprehensive reports and descriptions of the sector. Our business process simulation of the 4PL transportation planning process including a simulation of the transportation concept planning based on practical data (quantitative data collection) allowed us to develop a broad understanding of the planning process effects of a 4PL approach. Finally the mixed method approach provided an opportunity for a greater assortment of divergent and/or complementary views (Venkatesh et al., 2013 ). These views enrich our understanding of the 4PL approach und help us to appraise the boundary conditions of the approach and the relationships and open new avenues for future enquiries. 4.1 Semi-structured interviews Semi-structured interviews were carried out to focus the practical relevance for the sector. The implementation of a 4PL approach describes an innovative development for the sector. Considering this background it was important to allow the researcher to develop a keen understanding of the topic of interest of the sector. Additionally, the semi-structured interview method provides clearly structured instructions for interviewers, so that reliable and comparable qualitative data could be provided. The main topics of the 4PL approach could be analysed by the actors. Furthermore, the actors got a detailed impression of the 4PL approach so that barriers and attributes related to fear of change could be answered. In the end, practical quantitative data could be provided by the actors, which were needed for the business process simulation.  4.2 Business process simulation The business process simulation enabled process diagnosis by simulating real-word cases. Experts and involved actors can check modelling or propose modifications of the original process model (Van der Aalst et al., 2003 ). The actors of the processes were involved and process times, waiting times and lead time could be checked (quantitative research). The simulation technique connects the strategic aims in consideration of sustainability factors in order to achieve a successful 4PL implementation. For this the 4PL, the transportation planning process has to be modelled (Fig. 2 ), whereby the process step “transportation concept planning” was identified as key for a resource efficiency of the resources of the network. A detailed transportation concept planning simulation was developed through programmed software. Both the business process simulation and the detailed transportation concept planning simulation can be used to test the validity of empirical results for an application of the 4PL approach. For the business process simulation, various process notations and application software were examined. As a result, the Process Simulator 2014 (Pro Model Corporation) was selected. With the software, processes can be depicted in the form of flow charts, and actors can be included in the organisational structure. Moreover, each particular process step can be modelled. Furthermore, performance indicators, such as processing time, lay times, and buffer or turnaround times, can be recorded. For the transportation concept planning simulation, we examined special factors of the agriculture bulk logistics sector. For example, the time frame for a transportation concept planning, the direct dispatching of bulk goods, the limitations of the resources, etc. to generate a better understanding of how transportation planning time affects the target of resource efficiency. Based on a literature review, we selected heuristics for the transportation concept planning to compare existing action patterns for dispatching transport with the simulated approach (Griffis et al., 2012; Confessore et al., 2008; Rothlauf, 2011 ). The input parameters for the transportation concept planning were transportation demand orders. These orders comprise loading (Pi ) and unloading (Di ) locations, a time slot for transportation and tonnage of the transportation volume. Based upon the transportation demand order, transportation assignments with a capacity of 25 tonnes each (carrying capacity of a single truck (C)) are generated. The sum of all TA represents a planning pool for a transportation concept planning within a planning horizon. The planning horizon may comprise time spans from several hours to months. This affects the timeframe; for example, 1–8 h during which the 4PL can use for this process step because the planning of the nearest TA describes the critical starting point. A longer calculation time of the heuristics in this process step is usually followed by a better use of resources because empty mileage is further reduced.   5 Application of the methods The application of the methods is divided according to the mixed method approach. First, the semi-structured interview approach is described together with an accurate description of the agriculture bulk logistics sector. This is followed by a description of the simulation. 5.1 Semi-structured interviews in the agriculture bulk logistics sector In collaboration with representatives of the sector's secondary cooperative a list of relevant actors in the northern German region was generated. This list included producers, primary cooperatives, agricultural trade, freight carriers, processors and secondary cooperative. The list was filtered and sorted according to the priorities function, experience and spatial distance. In this way the context of the supply chain was provided that included all actors that were interviewed. The survey was designed in a way that the actor with the highest priority for a function was approached first. If no response was received within two weeks the next actor in the priority list was approached and so forth. This approach was implemented on a rolling basis until each function was assigned an actor. The data capture was accomplished between February 2014 and May 2014. After initial telephone contact with the respondent all required information was emailed to the respondent in order to prepare him/her for the interview. In order to increase the validity and appropriateness of the study the following principles have been applied (Yin, 2012 ): (1) the use of several sources of evidence, (2) the generation of a case study data base, and (3) the selection of a tool for the presentation of evidence. In compliance with the first point as well as for the purpose of increasing the robustness of this research, various sources have been tapped for the presentation of evidence. Moreover, semi-structured interviews have been applied in order to capture additional insights and to enrich the findings of the 4PL transportation planning process. Furthermore, notes have been taken during the interviews and all interviews were audio-recorded. All recordings were transcribed and received a unique consecutive number. In compliance with Yin's second and third principles a case study database based on MAXQDA was set up. First, mere observations and raw data could be clearly separated from interpretations, research questions and conclusions. Second, empirical data served as verification for the 4PL approach. In total 17 expert interviews between 27 and 86 min were conducted. The expert interviews revealed the demand and the potential for a 4PL transportation planning process. The previous planning process was manually implemented. Each transport assignment was dispatched via telephone. In doing so each carrier as well as each loading and unloading dock was contacted.  5.2 Simulation of the 4PL transportation planning process The simulation of the complete business process “4PL transportation planning process” could be checked based on the information flow together with the experts (Reference after Review Process). The main planning process of the 4PL approach was named transportation concept planning and transportation planning. This section describes the application of heuristics based upon the database of bulk transport handling between 2010 and 2012 in order to identify the implications for efficiency and sustainability of transportation concept planning and transportation planning. First, a prototype of the 4PL platform was designed. This 4PL platform consists of a transport order planning module, a transport implementation module and a mySQL database. This database features a praxis-oriented dataset including elements such as loading and unloading address, customer data, goods, quantity, price, transport demand number and TA number. The research team generated the required spatial data of the loader and processors based upon an open source GeoConverter (Gpso, 2014 ) and these data were entered into the calculation. Based upon the aforementioned data pool it was possible to profile sector-specific parameters realistically. Sector specific parameters included special transport equipment for bulk goods (walking floor vehicle, silo vehicle, dump truck), bulk good quality, timeframes for loading and unloading. With the use of the data for the loading and unloading positions, and implementing the desired time slot for each vehicle operation, each transportation assignment was available in the form of a transport order detection within the mySQL database. Various heuristics like genetic search (GS), simulated annealing (SA) and tabu search (TB) were implemented in the transportation module (using a Java application). These heuristics are linked to the mySQL database which contains all transport assignments as recorded in the data pool. Due to challenges such as volatile fluctuations influencing the sector including weather conditions during the harvest, short-term orders by industry, long-term contracts, short-term handling of large volumes of imports and exports as well as various possible planning horizons, a whole array of simulations for the comparison of heuristics were designed. Based on realistic data 4000–5000 TA per month build the database for a transportation concept planning. In order to simulate a realistic planning horizon, orders of magnitudes of 20, 50, 100 and 1000 TA have been selected. A total of 200 potential carriers were used in the data pool. Furthermore, the run time of the heuristics was defined as follows:• 1 h for a short-term dispatch in order to respond to disruptions (truck breakdown, traffic jam, waiting for loading or unloading);  • 2 h for the dispatch of daily business either ante meridiem or post meridiem;  • 8 h for dispatch overnight.    Depending on the parameters defined above various optima may be calculated. The objective of the simulations was a comparison of the heuristics applied in order to reduce empty mileage. The increase in efficiency as well as the reduction of CO2  emissions could be derived from the reduction of empty mileage. The following assumptions had to be made:• Bulk goods that may not be transported consecutively were excluded from the simulation;  • A truck was either entirely loaded or empty;  • Trucks drove with an average velocity based upon statistics from the case study;  • Legally-imposed driving times were taken into account;  • Distances between loading and unloading docks were beelines.    Due to the multitude of parameters influencing the experiments a distinction was made between external parameters and heuristics-specific parameters. The external parameters comprise:• Velocity of vehicles – defined as 60 km/h;  • Maximum driving times – defined as 40 h per week. The legally prescribed maximum is 56 h per week. The difference complies with the buffer of possible delays according to Regulation (EC) no. 561/2006. 2006, article 6, section 2 ;  • The cargo capacity – defined as 25 tonnes per truck.    The heuristics-specific parameter settings for TS, extended TS (eTS), GS and SA as well as the hardware and software use for the simulations are described in the Appendix .   6 Results The results of our research have been divided into the simulation results and the results based on the semi structured interviews. We present both categories in a structured way. First, we present the simulation results which describe the quantitative results of the transportation concept planning and transportation planning as part of the whole 4PL transportation planning process (Fig. 2 ). Based on the simulation and the comparison of the results, an assessment of the heuristics can be carried out. For the 4PL approach it can be identified which heuristics generates the best results in consideration of TA and calculation time (6.1 ). Following the quantitative results in savings of empty mileage of the simulation, we assess the complete 4PL transportation planning process according to the economic, ecologic, and social challenges using the mixed method approach (6.2 ). 6.1 Simulation results In total 72 simulation experiments have been performed. Table 1   lists the results of these experiments including empty mileage savings, TA (20, 50, 100, 200, 1000, 2000) and the related procedures (TS, eTS, GS, SA). The empty mileage saving is calculated from the empty mileage resulting from manual transport planning in the current situation (adhoc) subtracted from the empty mileage which are generated by the automated transportation concept planning process. Based on the empty mileage saved the efficiency improvement of the case study is presented. Depending upon both TA specifications and computing runtime the simulations resulted in different values for empty mileage savings. Consequently, the direct implications for transportation cost savings can be provided. For instance, with the eTS procedure the average cost savings are 36% with a 1 h runtime of the transportation concept planning process. With a runtime of 8 h the SA procedure generates cost savings of 38%. As a result of the limited runtime (1 h, 2 h, 8 h) the eTS procedure achieved the best results at a 1 h runtime in comparison with the other procedures within the same time frame. In the case of longer time frames SA appears to be the best solution. Furthermore, route planning with a pool of 200 TA achieves the highest optimisation potential of 46.2% within the SA procedure. The Tabu search (TS) as well as genetic search (GS) result in significantly poorer outcomes in comparison with an extended tabu search (eTS) and simulated annealing (SA). Furthermore, the degree of optimisation is especially high during the first simulation hour.  6.2 Results of the 4PL transportation planning process Based on the interviews and experiments the challenges for the 4PL transportation planning process can be specified. The subprocesses of the entire 4PL transportation planning process are of particular importance, so that the decision fields of the process were neglected. Based on the mixed method approach we collected information for each subprocess and general statements for a 4PL approach in the sector. Results, findings and impacts are presented in according to the economical, ecological and social challenges. Table 2   describes the challenges in combination with the subprocesses and the methods used. An ‘I’ indicates information derived from the semi-structured interview. An ‘S’ indicates that this information is based on the simulation of the transportation concept planning (6.1) and a simulation including the complete 4PL transportation planning process. The simulation of the complete 4PL transportation planning process was carried out based on a business process simulation (Process Simulator, 2014 – Pro Model Corporation). In addition, the heuristics and the heuristics-specific parameter settings for the simulations are described in the Appendix . Production costs: Based on the simulation of the transportation concept planning process and the process step of generating the final transportation route, the price for the processing of the shipment will decrease. This depends on the reduction of empty mileage of 36–38% in comparison with the current adhoc process of the agricultural bulk logistics sector. Based on the assumption of 200 daily TA a savings potential of approximately 116 km per TA can be estimated within this case study (about 50,000 TA per year). Hence, within a year roughly 5.8 million kilometres of empty mileage could be avoided. Order costs: Order costs which are generated in form of a planning function of the 4PL will be higher during the first step because the IT infrastructure has to be implemented first. Furthermore, the total number of employees which are involved in the process will be the same during the first step of the implementation process. Over the long-term the order costs per TO will be reduced. This is because the technology used and the infrastructure of the 4PL is capable of handling a high volume of transport orders with decreasing costs per TO. The target as defined by an expert is, “The logistics should offer economical and reliable transport”. Logistics costs: The transportation concept planning process changes the process for a carrier whereby currently an order of one transport assignment (TA) is generated to an order of one route of transports. A route is specified by 2–10 TA over an extended period of time (1–2 weeks). This results in better resource utilization because transport equipment is planned over a long term basis. Thus more transport orders can be executed and empty mileage is minimized. The simulation correlates with the view expressed by one expert: “We worry about the logistics and just take the tours that make sense for us. In addition, we try to combine routes”. In the end, lower fuel consumption, an optimisation of the assignment of staff and a minimization of the toll costs results in minimized logistics costs. These costs depend on the planning function of the 4PL approach. Moreover, assuming average fuel consumption of 32 l per 100 km and net costs of €1.15 per litre of diesel, the saving potential for annual fuel costs is approximately €2,134,000. Furthermore, at an average velocity of 60 km/h, 96,666 working hours could be saved, which correlates with €1,087,500 in labour costs at an average hourly wage of €11.25. However, the aforementioned model assumptions must be considered since the route network was designed as beeline distance time. In addition fuel savings must be adjusted by roughly +30%, which correlates with €966,570. Furthermore, 60% of the routes are toll roads (€0.288/km), which results in cost savings of €2,171,520. This amounts to annual cost savings of €6,359,990. These calculations refer to current route planning activities of the partners within the case study. For this case the research revealed that the number of TA reaches an optimum level for efficient route planning. Empty mileage savings range between 76.5 km/TA (2000 TA/2 h runtime) and 122 km/TA (200 TA/8 h runtime). Based upon the available dataset the optimum number of TA is 200. Lead time: The simulation of the 4PL transportation planning process results in a reduction of lay and transfer times by 41%. This depends on the implementation of the new technology in a more digitized way. The experts confirmed “that the adhoc process is managed by mobile phone, paper and fax”. The adjustments of the communication media enable an acceleration in the information flow. In the end the lead time for one transport order will be minimized from 44.582 h to 27.266 h which is a reduction of 39%. On time delivery: For the 4PL approach the on-time delivery will be a key figure for revising the transportation route planning. The experts stated that on-time delivery can be a cost factor because processors allocate delivery time slots in a way that loading or unloading is possible. If a time slot is passed this results in longer waiting times and costs. With the 4PL approach in combination with the IT infrastructure and a track-and-trace system the loading or unloading time can be tracked in a transparent way. This is beneficial for all actors involved in a transport order. Quality assurance: Quality assurance is a particular feature based on expert information. This is because only certified equipment for food transport is allowed to be used (“All carriers must be certified in QS and GMP”). This has to be incorporated in the planning of a transport order as well as in the final route planning because not all bulk products can be transported consecutively. This means that cleaning of the equipment is possible and should be incorporated in the route planning procedure. Rejection ratio: The rejection ratio is a key figure in the further development of the 4PL transportation planning process. Rejection is caused by the poor quality of the delivered material. In the agricultural bulk logistics sector samples are generated in the loading process and at the unloading point of the processor. A poor quality of the sample goods results in the rejection of the shipment, and the goods must be delivered to another processor with other specifications. For this a completely new transport plan has to be generated. Technology level: Development of the technology is a primary objective of the experts. The sector is willing to invest in new infrastructure and new technologies like smartphones, applications, communication platforms and ICT. All experts acknowledge the benefit of introducing new technologies (“We can improve the communication by implementing ICT”, “ICT will reduce my manual workload”, “Technology improvement will increase transparency in order execution”). The problem is that only isolated solutions are developed, but no solution across sectors is available on the market. The technology level can be described based on various statements: “We have a SQL database with an Access platform that we have created. In addition, of course, we use smartphones, e-mail and fax. I would also like to use an app to make communication with the staff more efficient and in real time“, “We mainly use the phone and the computer. After that fax and e-mail”, “We use the fax machine 99% of the time”. All experts have high expectations of the new technologies introduced by the 4PL. The Internet and a service platform of the 4PL will define the future whereby the communication will be smartphone- and application-based. Design of future services: The 4PL approach as an intermediary of a network has the opportunity to implement new services for that network. The interviewed experts agreed that a cooperative approach including each of the actors could be beneficial for the sector. They also confirmed that cooperation is of high interest for generating win-win-situations, and to minimize the problems caused by ad hoc planning. New services will be a further step of 4PL development for the sector. These developments could include an improvement of networking of service-providers, selection of service-providers, organization of service chains, generating of orders, acquisition of new customers, development of sector-specific standards, provision of key figures, provision of status reports, generation of freight documents, consultative skills, advanced technology capability, business process outsourcing, beyond logistics, project management, innovation and continual improvement of the sector. Pollution generation/reduction: Empty mileage savings result in CO2  and other emission reductions (Federal Environmental Agency for humans and the environment. Data on transport, 2012). Based upon the reduction of empty mileage (including the +30% adjustment) the 7,540,000 road kilometres saved correspond with a reduction of 735t of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) and 3.7t of nitrogen dioxide (NO2 ). Further CO2  reductions resulting from activities such as decreased use of printing paper and auxiliary electricity will occur but cannot be validated. Resources consumption: Reduced consumption of resources is a consequence of a reduced empty mileage. The fuel consumption will be minimized per TA. Savings in time transport equipment (trucks) represents a further decrease in resources consumption. Eco-design and environmental management systems can be seen as an advanced development step for the 4PL approach and for the entire transportation planning process. Employment practices: The employment practices will change for all involved actors. This is due to the introduction of contemporary communication media. While telephone, paper and fax are currently the main media, the internet and a service platform of the 4PL will be the future media (digital). As a result all administrative employees can work more flexibly and home office opportunities are created. For the employees of the carriers the employment practice will change in a more structured and planned way because complete routes are ordered instead of random orders. The fully digitized technology and infrastructure will support a significant reduction of work related to filling out forms and processing of paper documents. A negative effect could be that truck drivers cannot return home on a daily basis. Health and safety: The 4PL approach has a significant effect on the health and safety of truck drivers. Based on a comprehensive planning approach and a track and trace of the transportation route the 4PL approach provides instant intervention in the event of traffic jams or other disturbances. In this way the stress factor can be minimized. Influence on the sector: For the sector as a whole the 4PL is a new and innovative approach. In general the sector has a conservative attitude towards new technologies and new means of communication. The actors in the sector have built up long-term experiences and long-term cooperation. The first step for introducing a 4PL approach in the network will be the implementation of service infrastructure. Service infrastructure defines the 4PL-platform and the new communication media. Based on the infrastructure new processes have to be implemented and the effects of the simulation will follow. Once these process are in place economic growth can be expected which positively effects the development of the 4PL approach in the network. Stakeholder influence: Due to the 4PL-based comprehensive transportation planning process the 4PL would take on a cross-sectoral role within the bulk logistics sector. Independent planning activities of carriers have to be handed over to the 4PL. At the same time the 4PL can adopt a supervisory position. Hence, the core competence of carriers would be driving the planned routes. On the one hand the carrier selection process has a high influence on the success of the 4PL approach. On the other, partnerships with the processors, producers, agricultural traders and primary and secondary cooperatives are important for generating transportation volumes for comprehensive transportation planning.   7 Discussion This section identifies some of the important findings of our research. The major contribution of this paper was to provide a transportation planning process for the 4PL approach and to show the added value and sustainability benefits of the 4PL approach. The results can be subdivided into practical and scientific results as well as limitations. 7.1 Practical sustainability insights The results demonstrate a significant improvement in transportation planning within the agricultural bulk logistics sector when employing a 4PL based on the 4PL transportation planning process that has been generated. A classification is possible according to the economic, ecologic and social challenges. From an economic perspective, the 4PL generates cost savings in the production and the logistics processes. Additionally, an improvement in the order cost is possible to the extent that the technology level of the sector is improved. The technology level associated with the 4PL enables quicker information flow between the actors whereby logistics service measures like on-time delivery, quality assurance and rejection ratio can be better tracked. Additionally the technology level supports the development of future services for the 4PL approach which do not depend on the core competence of one actor so that administrative processes can be bundled and improved resulting in a win-win-situation. Ecologically, pollution reduction can result from the planning approach employed by the 4PL. This depends on a completely new and comprehensive transport disposition which is an innovation for the sector. Depending on the level of innovation, savings in resource consumption will follow. An eco-design as well as environmental management systems could be new research areas for the sector. Social aspects in the form of actors' willingness to participate, as well as their technological limitations in the implementation of 4PL could be identified. Willingness is limited because each actor expressed reservations and fear of change in terms of the impact on themselves. The limitations in ability is demonstrated by the fact that “there is currently no player in the sector who is able to build such a platform and operate”. The necessary IT know-how is not yet available for the industry in centralized form. Through the 4PL, business actors should be open for new developments especially in a sector where substantial gains can be made. The introduction of the 4PL approach on the level of the secondary cooperative seems to be the most promising method. However, the success of this exercise depends on the height of the secondary cooperatives' trade value: a high trade value entails a high number of transport assignments, which again constitute the basis for the transportation planning pool. Furthermore, the implementation of the 4PL approach on the level of the secondary cooperative has very good prospects as those actors possess the economic capacity to invest in the sector. Furthermore, they are very well integrated in the network, as our interviewed experts affirm, and are in a position to provide a proven ICT infrastructure.  7.2 Scientific insights Scientific insights could be identified with the sustainability considerations of the 4PL approach that were taken into account and by the mixed method approach used by our research. We adapted the documented features of sustainable supply chain management (Govindan et al., 2013; Nikolaou et al., 2013 ) in the 4PL approach. This adaptation enables a detailed perspective of the 4PL approach with regard to the numerous interfaces (actors, information, technology, cooperation) of a 4PL. Furthermore we describe benefits of the 4PL approach in a real world scenario. However, based on further ICT development in the future a 4PL approach could be a major contribution to comprehensive supply chain management. The mixed method helped us to generate quantitative and qualitative results. On the one hand the semi-structured interviews delivered qualitative data for social challenges. To test the implementation of a 4PL approach in a supply chain it was important to get a direct feedback from the actors. Furthermore critical aspects like existential fears and future requirements like key advantages of the approach could be identified. On the other hand, the quantitative-based simulations identified the economic and ecological aspects of a 4PL approach when introduced in the sector. The quantitative insights are important for further investment decisions and for generating various implementation steps or a supply chain strategy. Finally, we employed the 4PL approach as an artefact based on the 4PL transportation planning process. We presented a sector which is increasingly important for supplying the population with a sustainable concept of logistics.  7.3 Limitations A number of factors that determine uncertainty within the system must be taken into account: The selection of the heuristics was based upon a literature search. These results have been applied to a selected case study. The route planning problem described in this article is applied and interpreted frequently depending upon the scientific subject and the sector. The sector-specific focus may result in additional limitations. The results cannot be directly transferred to other sectors. The number of TA to be integrated in the transportation planning process is just one determining variable. Furthermore, the case study effort relies on a data set of 50,000 TA from just one actor. The spatial scale of the case study includes the region of Northern Germany. Other regions in Germany or elsewhere in the world may have other characteristics. The experiment used data from past route planning activities which include implications for fluctuating flows of goods. Initial feedback from interviewees in the semi-structured interviews affirms the savings potential and the need for more research.   8 Conclusions and further research The results of our research presented in this article demonstrate an impressive potential for cost and CO2  savings. Even after taking the aforementioned range (cost, CO2 ) into account, the order of magnitude remains impressive. Moreover, the circumstance that a significant reduction of CO2  emissions can be accomplished with only a moderate financial effort (e.g., relatively low investments in IT infrastructure), constitutes an excellent example for a win–win situation. In addition, should this 4PL approach be implemented beyond the agricultural bulk logistics sector in Northern Germany, it would significantly contribute to the fulfilment of the national 20-20-20 targets on greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, the documented features of sustainable supply chain management supported a comprehensive assessment of the 4PL approach. Our research shows that the 4PL approach is applicable in practice. In order to implement the 4PL approach in the real world, route planning activities as well as the interests and perspectives of the involved actors must be respected. While the positive effect with regard to economic and ecological savings is beyond doubt, the process to distribute the savings equitably among the participating parties is still to be developed and thus constitutes an essential future research approach. Only if the savings achieved through the application of a 4PL are equitably distributed among the involved actors, a sustainable effect can be expected in the social dimension of this sector. In order to be able to comprehensively demonstrate the added value, performance indicators, that reveal the benefits of the 4PL in the sector and for all participating actors, must be developed. In order to allow for a more sustainable agricultural bulk sector, it is recommendable to better prepare for the 4PL implementation. For this purpose it is useful that the 4PL takes on defined functions, such as the IT services, the consulting of the actors or the purchasing cooperation. In light of the small margins within the sector, ICT applications must be adapted or redesigned in the future in order to increase acceptance among the relevant actors. The main focus of a 4PL lies on the increase in transparency with respect to information as well as the transport market, however, this depends on the extent to which the actors are in competition with each other. For the introduction of additional sustainable concepts in the future, such as the CO2  footprint for transportation in agriculture, political incentives may be necessary. The scientific effort to implement a 4PL transportation planning process for full truckload shipping significantly contributes to the enhancement of the image of a 4PL approach within the agricultural bulk logistics sector. Within various planning horizons, the applied heuristics demonstrate optimised uses of resources, which makes a substantial contribution to a more sustainable transportation sector. Additionally, with our research we are the first to consider the 4PL approach from the perspective of a sustainable supply chain management and to validate this by a mixed method approach that describes an application-oriented research. The results demonstrate the applicability of the 4PL approach and mark it as a long-term objective. Hence, the economic benefits of the actors can be improved. When assuming an improved interconnectedness and a more intense deployment of ICT, the results of this research provide a promising development for this sector and further research.   Appendix The Tabu search was apriori implemented in a conventional manner, where the transformation rule corresponds with the 2-Opt procedure. The 2-Opt procedure deploys a simple neighbourhood search (optimisation). On the assumption of Euclidian distance among all nodes this procedure reconciles all edges that cross other edges in a way that a route consists of edges that do not cross each other (Nickel et al., 2014 ) (TS). The transformation rules are an extended version of the Lin-Kernighan heuristics (eTS). This procedure is also called variable k-opt heuristic. It includes the opportunity to exchange an arbitrary number of nodes. This is performed until a k optimum is achieved (Lin, 1965 ). While the value of k is constant for the k-opt heuristic, the Lin-Kernighan heuristic may vary throughout the optimisation procedure (Lin and Kernighan, 1973 ). The tabu list is consistent with a quarter of the number of nodes. The temperature of the simulated annealing corresponds with the entire available runtime divided by 100. The cooling rate corresponds with the elapsed run time. The population size of the genetic search was 25 individuals. The crossover operation is a two-point crossover. The mutation probability is 20%. The mutation operation is 50% genetic sequence reverse and 50% point mutation. Finally the hardware and software use for all calculations was a computer with the following features: Windows 7 Enterprise-Service Pack 1; Processor: Intel®  Core™, i5-3550CPU@3,30 GHz; Memory: 8.00 GB; System: 64 Bit OS; JRE version: 1.7.0_45; Database server:5.6.16 – MySQL Community Server (GPL), (localhost), Java based prototype 4PL-Platform.
