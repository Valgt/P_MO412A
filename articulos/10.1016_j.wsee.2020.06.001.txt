                  The coastal area, with its fragile environment and the characteristics of both marine and terrestrial, is getting increasing attention globally, highlighting a critical need to form a systematic management framework. The objectives of this article are to illustrate the status quo of Chinese regional ecological civilization and land-sea integrated development, then combine resilience theory and sustainable development goals (SDGs) of United Nations together for selecting social-ecological indicators to build a resilience assessment matrix applying to the coastal urban area, further explore the core mechanisms of coastal resilience evolution. Accordingly, we suggest a new method of evaluation matrix with 12 indicators, representing the function of the target system in four phases (prepare, absorb, recover and adapt) and three domains (economic, natural resources and eco-environment) respectively, which focusing on the dynamic progress instead of the static situation of the typical and unique urbanizing area is exactly one of its improvements in comparison with other existing assessment tools. The key findings reveal the dificient resilience of Dapeng New District in dealing with the rapid urbanization stressor, as well as its asymmetrical performance among three subsystems within the temporal scope of 2014–2016. Another contribution reflected in the regime shifts of land-sea integration, which uncovers the states of critical functions in the target system, correspondingly outlines how to integrate the land use, water management, and biodiversity conservation into resilience-based management and sustainability for the coastal zone, namely the Land-Water-Biodiversity Nexus. Our scope is taking the typical coastal zone, Shenzhen Dapeng New District, Greater Bay Area of China, as an example, and to promote the research technology in other coastal urban regions.

Table 2   Indicators Hypothetical relations with resilience   S1 In the beginning, governments tend to improve the economic ability of cities to cope with economic risks and crises.  S2 Hereafter, the pursuit of fast economic growth and development scale led to the crisis of the urban ecosystem.  S3 After the crisis government comes to restore urban vitality through activating technological innovation and explore urban economic functions.  S4 Finally, it reaches the stage with upgrading structural and distinctive leading economic industries.  N1 Reflects the industrial production efficiency and the utilization rate of natural resources.  N2 Represents the preservation of urban green space systems.  N3 Reflects the efficiency of urban resource utilization.  N4 Reflects the current status of urban ecological space and natural ecosystems in nearshore waters.  E1 Reflect the city's emphasis on air protection (“Air Pollution Prevention Action Plan” (2013)).  E2 Reflect the city's emphasis on water protection (“Water Pollution Prevention Action Plan” (2015)).  E3 Reflect the city's emphasis on soil protection “Soil Pollution Prevention Action Plan” (2016)  E4 The goal of people-oriented ecological civilization is to improve the quality of life and the status of residents.     Table 3 Resilience assessment results on Dapeng New District ecological civilization.  Table 3  Notes: ① The cell, “the proportion of marine economic output to GDP”, is blank as no statistics. It can be seen that the development of marine economy in Shenzhen Dapeng New District is in the start-up stage, related statistics were neglected. ② The value of “GRP per unit of development land” in 2016 is derived from the “Dapeng New District Ecological Civilization Comprehensive Evaluation Index Accounting Report”. While after comparative analysis, there is an apparent deviation between 2016 and the previous two years, which is defined as data error. Considering the indicator has steadily increased and has reached the full mark, this item is recorded as 100 points. ③ The credibility of the “Renewable Resource Recovery rate” in the Natural Resources module is open to question. The raw data has rapidly increased from 41% in the previous two years to 70% in 2016, directly achieve the goal of “Guidelines for Comprehensive Resources Utilization of Twelfth Five-Year”. ④ The color of cubes means the grade of the score of each indicator, for example, green stands for 100, light yellow stands for 75-100, and dark yellow means the score under 75.

Xiamen University Xiamen 361102 China       The coastal area, with its fragile environment and the characteristics of both marine and terrestrial, is getting increasing attention globally, highlighting a critical need to form a systematic management framework. The objectives of this article are to illustrate the status quo of Chinese regional ecological civilization and land-sea integrated development, then combine resilience theory and sustainable development goals (SDGs) of United Nations together for selecting social-ecological indicators to build a resilience assessment matrix applying to the coastal urban area, further explore the core mechanisms of coastal resilience evolution. Accordingly, we suggest a new method of evaluation matrix with 12 indicators, representing the function of the target system in four phases (prepare, absorb, recover and adapt) and three domains (economic, natural resources and eco-environment) respectively, which focusing on the dynamic progress instead of the static situation of the typical and unique urbanizing area is exactly one of its improvements in comparison with other existing assessment tools. The key findings reveal the dificient resilience of Dapeng New District in dealing with the rapid urbanization stressor, as well as its asymmetrical performance among three subsystems within the temporal scope of 2014–2016. Another contribution reflected in the regime shifts of land-sea integration, which uncovers the states of critical functions in the target system, correspondingly outlines how to integrate the land use, water management, and biodiversity conservation into resilience-based management and sustainability for the coastal zone, namely the Land-Water-Biodiversity Nexus. Our scope is taking the typical coastal zone, Shenzhen Dapeng New District, Greater Bay Area of China, as an example, and to promote the research technology in other coastal urban regions.

At present, the region is facing overwhelming pressures such as changes in land-use patterns and sedimentary environment, increased pollution and sea-level rise, and degradation of fishery resources (Jones et al., 2013 ; Thorne et al., 2018 ). However, these adversities resulted from rapid urbanization happens to promote the researches and applications of sustainable development and resilience ideas (Bai et al., 2014 ; Malhi et al., 2019 ). The sustainable and resilient development of the coastal zone needs to consider the nexus between the land and sea, such as the natural flows occurring between realms, to balance and incorporate information from multiple stakeholders, to identify the priority of voluntary commitment by states, governmental or non-governmental organizations, thus to develop regional and national strategies for coastal risk reduction through natural and hybrid infrastructure (Neumann and Unger, 2019 ; Sutton-Grier et al., 2015 ). Thus, solving regional environmental issues from a global perspective is the core idea of this research. In 2015, the United Nations presented 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with 169 sub-goals, among which enhancing system resilience is one of the key goals in the next 15 years. Two years later, the UN signed The New Urban Agenda, the declaration proposed to ensure environmental sustainability and strengthen urban resilience. These documents emphasize the urgency of sustainable and resilient management of coastal natural resources, guide us to decompose global targets to a regionally-oriented management system, thereby reducing the susceptibility of systems to disasters and promote the resilience and adaptability of coastal zones. Resilience or sustainability theory is both cross-cutting and emphasized concepts frequently used in the evaluation of SDGs. Resilience in physics means the ability of a target object to revert to its original state after being disturbed. After several revisions, resilience theory has evolved into a new stage where the adaptive cycle was proposed to implement its flexibility in continuously changing the social-ecological system (Carpenter et al., 2011 ). Sustainability, the core mechanism of SDGs, measures the capacity of the biosphere and human civilization to exist constantly, which encourages new development to meet the demand of present without compromising the ability of future generations. Sustainability is an ideal state or result while the theory of resilience draws attention to the process of system deformation (Marchese et al., 2018 ; Redman, 2014 ). Although both the resilience and sustainability theory focuses on the dynamics of the system and the diversity of stakeholders (Redman, 2014 ), they also lead to the confusion between the two in many academic articles and policy documents (Elmqvist, 2017 ). Different responses to risks are key factors to distinguish between the two (Kates et al., 2001 ; Meerow et al., 2016 ). Resilience is a supplement and sublimation of the concept of sustainable development. Systemic assessment of resilience is the first step in building a resilient city. The risk management-oriented resilience assessment model was used to assess the vulnerability of coastal cities facing natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, wildfire, and typhoons (McWethy et al., 2019 ). Based on assessment results it proposed suggestions such as limiting the rapid expansion of densely populated residential areas (Barria et al., 2019 ; Meerow and Newell, 2017 ). The resilience assessment criteria based on land-water-biodiversity nexus stresses the interaction between different ecosystems, pointing out the priority of regulating land use and biodiversity conservation to maintain system resilience (Wang et al., 2018 ). According to Grafton (Grafton et al., 2019 ), planning, adaptation and transformation actions are critical factors shaping the characteristics of social-ecological systems. The key to applying resilience thinking is to improve the adaptability of social-ecological systems, to maintain the health of landscapes and aquatic system, and to adjust internal needs by enhancing the internal and external links (Sellberg et al., 2018 ; Warrick et al., 2017 ), which inevitably leads to conflicts between original driving factors and powers among stakeholders, and then increase the difficulty of planning and management. Weighing the opinions of different participants in the scenario planning and decision-making process can effectively solve the contradiction. Although the research of resilience practice is insufficient, its superiority to sustainability makes it potential to promote and stimulate the transformation and upgrading of ecological civilization in China. Its popularization also reflects the connection and combination of social science, ecology, urban planning and other related disciplines (Cretney, 2014 ; Donohue et al., 2016 ). Resilience thinking is open to changes and uncertainties, which superiority in a continuously changing world comparing with risk-based approaches shows its great prospect in sustainability assessment (Jozaei et al., 2020 ). However, one of the main challenges in applying resilience thinking to practice is to localize the theoretical model into the “real world”. Hence, a macroscopic resilience framework together with the empirical analysis will help us to better understand the core meaning of the social-ecological system. The objectives of this paper are: (1) build an assessment framework of social-ecological resilience for the coastal urban area by analyzing current governmental documents and conducting field surveys; (2) compare the proposed matrix with other evaluation tools and test its compatibility with SDGs; (3) apply the assessment results into the land-sea integrated resilient management of Dapeng so as to further achieve SDGs in the coastal area.  2 Study area Dapeng New District is located in the southeast of Shenzhen, surrounded by the sea on three sides, east of Daya Bay, bordering Huizhou, and holding Dapeng Bay in the west (Fig. 1  ). Geographically, it is an important node in the Greater Bay Area of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau. The area of the jurisdiction is 600 km2 , of which the land area is 295 km2 , the sea area is 305 km2 , and the coastline is 133 km long. From administrative division and population aspect, Dapeng New District has three offices in Kuichong, Dapeng and Nanao subdistrict, 25 communities, with a permanent population of nearly 200,000 and a registered population of 39,000. While, it is precisely because Dapeng was established as an ecological pilot, national or local regulations set lax standards for its economic indicators. Since its foundation five years ago, Dapeng has been awarded the “National Pilot of Ecological Civilization” (2014, 2015, 2018) and the “National Pilot of Marine Ecological Civilization” (2015, 2018), which showed not only its abundant natural resources and great ecological environment conditions, and also reflected its incentive and attempt of exploring a new way to environment-friendly cities. Same as many cities in China, Dapeng has been already struggling with environmental degradation such as natural shoreline depletion, traffic congestion, inadequate urban infrastructure such as hospitals and schools, and a lack of basic services, such as water sanitation and waste management. Maintaining economic growth, while creating a sustainable livable city is the biggest urban challenge facing Dapeng and other Chinese cities. Recently, transformative resilience has been laid out to distinguish the former phases, basic resilience and adaptive resilience, which encourages systems to embrace risks in upstream approaches such as by rebuilding ecosystem structure (McWethy et al., 2019 ). Nevertheless, it requires tremendous social agreement and political effort for any of a developed city (Frantzeskaki et al., 2018 ). Therefore, taking Dapeng as a sample to further explore the mechanism of resilience practice is of great advantage as it is full of vitality to design sustainable pilot cities in China. It is of great significance for promoting the ecological civilization in China and is also a forward-looking study of resilience practice useful for all the coastal areas in the world.  3 Methodology The coastal zone resilience evaluation system is an innovative system based on land-sea integration and social-ecological system resilience theory. According to the characteristics of the Chinese environmental management system and the triple bottom line theory, the assessment module is divided into three sub-systems: socio-economic, natural resources and eco-environment, which corresponds to the departments' reform of Chinese central government in 2018 as well. From the time scale, the regional development patterns can be summarized as four stages of prepare, absorb, recover and adapt (Linkov et al., 2014 ). So far, we can evaluate the performance of various subsystems in response to global climate change in different stages, to provide specific and precise policy implications against the specific spatial-temporal objectives to meet the SDGs. The basis for the implementation of SDGs is the construction of a dynamic assessment system based on practice and monitoring. Yonehara et al. (2017)  decomposed the 15-year planning goal into three phases: a planning phase driven by a feasibility assessment, an improvement phase characterized by formative assessment and monitoring, and a completion phase involving outcome and impact assessment. The resilience theory also stresses understanding adaptive cycles from a longer temporal period, or a bigger spatial scale, the global production ecosystem, as objectives of different stages determine the focal indicator of an evaluation framework (Nyström et al., 2019 ). Investigating key formants and conducting weight surveys is to prioritize assessment indicators through understanding stakeholders' cognition about resilience and sustainability in different sectors or hierarchies (Voinov et al., 2016 ). 45 indicators in the index weighing questionnaire are extracted from 20 evaluation documents of ecological civilization and green development in China that have been enacted since 2012. A total of 250 key informants, including government officers (Environmental Protection and Water Affairs Bureau, City Administration, Economic Services Bureau, Development and Finance Bureau, Integrated Legal Enforcement Bureau of Eco-Resources and Environment, Planning and Land Commission), grassroots officers (staff of the sub-district office), enterprise representatives (Shenzhen Cheer land Life Technology Investment Co., Ltd., Shenzhen Tissue Bank Precision Medicine Co., Ltd., Shenzhen Overseas Chinese Town Co., Ltd., Shenzhen BGI Marine Science & Technology Co. Ltd., BYD Co., Ltd.) and the masses were interviewed. Eventually, we got 211 valid questionnaires. Based on the field survey and adaptive resilience theory, we select 12 indicators from 45 candidate indicators (Table 1  ). The core mechanism of assessing system resilience is to measure its ability threshold tolerating pervasive risks (Standish et al., 2014 ). As a consequence, the indicator selection strictly adheres to the development status of the coastal zone and regulations the resilience is formed. On account of some data deficiency, “surrogates” were presented to acknowledge that important aspects of resilience in a system may not be directly observable (Darnhofer et al., 2010 ; Scheffer et al., 2000 ). The illustration in the collection of the 12 targets is as follows (Table 2  ): Historically, global urbanization and economic development have common features, cities expanding with the increase of population (Bettencourt et al., 2007 ). Initially, economic development is given top priority, the government tends to improve the ability of cities to cope with economic risks and crises (S1 ). Hereafter, the pursuit of fast economic growth and development scale led to the crisis of the urban ecosystem (S2 ). After the crisis government comes to realize the truth to restore urban vitality through activating technological innovation and explore urban economic functions (S3 ). Finally, it reaches the stage with upgrading structural and distinctive leading economic industries (S4 ). A stock that yields a flow of valuable goods or services into the future is called natural capital (Costanza and Daly, 1992 ), whose importance is reflected in the continuous provision of ecosystem services. Protecting and increase the value of natural resources is an important way to enhance human well-being (Vassallo et al., 2017 ). In resilience theory, the lower the “Energy consumption per unit GRP”, the higher the industrial production efficiency, the higher the utilization rate of natural resources, namely, the stronger the ability of urban ecosystems to cope with natural resource crises. N2 , one of the indicators for biodiversity assessment, represents the preservation outcome of urban green space systems. N3  is an indicator reflecting the efficiency of urban resource utilization. N4  reflects the current status of urban ecological space and natural ecosystems in nearshore waters. From the issue of China's “Air Pollution Prevention Action Plan” (2013), “Water Pollution Prevention Action Plan” (2015), and “Soil Pollution Prevention Action Plan” (2016), we conclude the attention transformation of our nation in the face of major environmental events. Therefore, E1 , E2 , and E3  are selected to reflect the city's emphasis on air, water and soil contamination respectively. The goal of people-oriented ecological civilization is improving the quality of life and status of residents, E4  as an indicator of ecological habitat, represents the final stage of urban resilience. Before using the above assessment model, we need to first define the targeted system and its major threats, identify the critical functions of the study area, and select the performance indicators (Yamagata and Sharifi, 2018 ), then calculate the score, ultimately identify gaps and prioritize efforts by interpreting the matrix results. Data sources include Shenzhen Statistical Yearbook (2014, 2015, 2016), Dapeng New District Statistical Yearbook (2014, 2015, 2016), Report on the State of the Environment in Shenzhen (2014, 2015, 2016), Dapeng New District Ecological Index (2014, 2015, 2016). Threshold sources include Guideline for Construction of National Ecological Civilization Pilot in Dapeng New District (2014–2016, 2013–2020), Twelfth Five-Plan of Human Settlements in Shenzhen (2010), Twelfth Five-Plan of Resources Utilization (2011), Index of Marine Ecological Civilization Pilot (on trial) (2012), Index of National Ecological Civilization Pilots for Counties and Prefectures (2018). More information about the threshold could be found in Table A1  (Appendix 2 ). There are positive and negative indicators in the evaluation system, and evaluation criteria vary among different indicators. To reduce the deviation among them, this paper normalized all the values in the matrix, ranging from zero to 100. Zero means no response, and 100 indicates that the subsystem responds well in the corresponding phase, meeting the threshold of national policy documents. Normalize data as followed: For indicators positively related to ecological civilization (positive indicators): Qi = 100 × Ci Si   , When Ci >Si , take Qi  = 100. For indicators that are negatively correlated with ecological civilization (inverse indicators): Qi = 100 × Si Ci   , When Ci  < Si , take Qi  = 100. Note: Qi  is the standard value of the indicator i; Si  is the threshold of the indicator i; Ci  is the current value of the indicator i. The threshold value of each indicator is available from national or local governmental documents, such as the five-year plan of China or Shenzhen city.  4 Results According to the instruction of the resilience matrix, the main threat in the Dapeng district is defined as the urban ecosystem degradation caused by rapid anthropogenic urbanization. Its core functions are defined as residential areas, high-tech biotechnology and marine industries, ecological protection and tourism. Given Dapeng's history and the accessibility of data sources, we sorted out information from three years in 2014, 2015 and 2016. The three years have witnessed the construction and development of Dapeng District from a little coastal village to a developing modern eco-district. The results are as follows (Table 3  ). Owing to the implementation of a series of ecological civilization regulations, results indicate a remarkable performance in the ecological civilization of Shenzhen Dapeng New District with achieving high scores of 91.16, 92.94 and 95.58 in 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively. The horizontal analysis shows that the scores of the latter two stages are significantly lower than the first stage, that is, the ecosystem of the study area has insufficient resilience in response to the urbanization crisis, thus cannot respond, recover and adapt in time, which also demonstrates the indicator selection in resilience matrix is in line with the objective discipline of urban development. The reason for this result is that resilience planning and management have not been applied into the urban risk management system. Most of the existing financial funds are applied to physical disaster prevention and mitigation, and these measures cannot improve the ability of the research region to recover and adapt to the risks from rapid urbanization. In addition, with the planning and policy not completely conducted, the ecological restoration effect has not yet fully manifested. The longitudinal analysis shows that the social and economic module tends to get higher scores, with the natural resources and ecosystem modules relatively low scores. For example, the value of “natural shoreline retention rate” is unstable, and it has not met the goal of “no reducing” set by “Marine Ecological Civilization Demonstration Zone Construction Indicator System (Trial)”. In some respects, the Shenzhen municipal government set a relatively lower economic threshold while a relatively higher environment threshold to Dapeng as it is an ecosystem-services-oriented administrative district.  5 Discussion 5.1 Comparison with other resilience assessment tools In Dapeng District, the comprehensive index has been calculated since 2014, trying to use a single index to reflect the progress of ecological civilization status. There is superiority in both targets (city or agglomeration) and scope (up-down or bottom-up) between the comprehensive index and our resilience matrix. While, the land-sea integration, social-ecological theory and resilience concept are added in the assessment matrix. Researches have also been done to assess the vulnerability of Shenzhen city by InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) tools, same as our results, relative moderate SLR (sea level rise) scores and socially-sensitivities in comparison with western Shenzhen, but lower adaptive capacity was observed in the Dapeng district (Zhang et al., 2020 ). In short, we advocate the coastal zone resilience assessment model merges with SDGs that determines the assessment indicators from the four stages of regional development and sustainable development. It quantifies the regional resilience from different time dimensions and meanwhile enhances the local-global linkages through combining sustainable development goals. Resilience assessment of ecosystems can effectively identify key risks faced by target systems and help raise community awareness (Prior and Hagmann, 2014 ). The dynamics and temporal-spatial complexity of the social-ecosystem insisted by resilience theory are gradually being accepted and used by urban planning and management disciplines. However, the devil is always in the details, that is as resilience is still an emerging subject, there are no accurate and universal assessment tools for planners to embed resilience theory into practice (Sellberg et al., 2015 ). Besides, the role of spatial knowledge and visualization technology is still absent in resilience evaluation and practice (Borie et al., 2019 ). Globally, there are much regional Resilience Assessment (CRA) to assess the level of resilience in regions. Sharifi (Sharifi and Yamagata, 2016 ) compared 36 CRA tools worldwide and found that only in 4 assessment tools all the four stages of resilience theory were included, most models ignore the latter two stages of recovery and adaptation. As for the assessment methodology, the resilience assessments in coastal rural villages showed that practices utilizing local and indigenous knowledge have helped locals effectively mitigate the impacts of disasters (Chen and Cheng, 2020 ); a resilience assessment approach for power system used two resilience indices from the perspectives of the system and individual component levels, respectively (Liu et al., 2020 ); recently, Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping has been used to elicit subjective views on resilience mechanisms of the wastewater sector in the Belfast area (Northern Ireland) (Tepes and Neumann, 2020 ). Totally, we are trying to find a common solution for resilience assessment by conducting empirical researches in different regions. Cutter (Cutter, 2016 ) raised a question whether there is an evaluation system that considers all the “10 essentials” for making cities resilient by United Nations' Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) after analyzing 27 US resilience assessment tools, indices and scorecards in terms of four parameters, including focus (on assets baseline conditions), spatial orientation (local to the globe), mythology (top-down or bottom-up) and domain area (characteristic to capacities). Despite this, we also encounter some problems in the application of the resilience assessment model, including (1) the absence of data for some indicators will directly lead to inaccurate results. For example, in this assessment, due to the lack of data on the “GDP ratio of marine economic output”, the final result is not as authentic analyzing the social-economic module; (2) practice has proved that the integrity and simplicity of the assessment cannot be accomplished jointly. Considering the uncertainty of the system and the role of dynamic impact factors, the sole independent indicators are not always perfectly accurate or common suitable in practices, while miscellaneous indicators cause trouble to governmental officers and the public (Bennett et al., 2013 ). In practice, policy documents that give priority to sustainable development tend to focus only on the maximization of resource utilization efficiency, ignoring the social equity caused by resource allocation (Elmqvist et al., 2019 ); (3) as resilience thinking and its planning is still in its infancy, even if the research on the threshold is the leading topic of resilience theory, the judgment of threshold and boundary of indicators are not accurate (Lade et al., 2019 ; Walker and Meyers, 2004 ). So, the results of the matrix are mainly used to identify the gaps between sub-systems in terms of corresponding capabilities; (4) there is a contradiction between macro-coordination and micro-dimension. As diversities and complexities of targets' core functions, there may be a partial bias for the selection of a certain index, consequently, deviation will be involved in the comprehensive analysis. For instance, when we take ecological residential as the main function of Dapeng New District, we tend to focus more on urban infrastructure, urban living standards and ecological livability. Nevertheless, when port trade or tourism is the main function, economic level, industrial exploitation intensity and resource utilization efficiency become dominant factors. The solution to this problem is to evaluate the resilience of the study area by sub-function, which, however, loses the advantage of assessing in a holistic view.  5.2 The correlation between resilience indicators and SDGs The propose of sustainability theory makes the urban sustainability assessment frameworks (USAFs) emerge in an endless stream (Ameen and Mourshed, 2019 ), which targets include risk assessment and potential risk impact assessment (Pope et al., 2017 ). Sustainability assessment is currently designed to fit into relevant decision context, depending on the objectives, the scale and the scope, namely, it acknowledges the importance of pluralism (Cinelli et al., 2014 ). While its long evaluation period, strong normative nature, and lack of feedback mechanism have become obstructions that hinder the promotion of sustainable evaluation. The resilience assessment model in this article combines the merits of sustainability assessment by taking some SDGs into consideration, which is a refinement of the common ideals of global sustainable development, and also a concrete way and innovative practice to achieve this goal (Xu et al., 2015 ). Taking the SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and communities), for example, sub-target SDG 11.3.1 states the Ratio of land consumption rate to population growth rate for assessing the urban planning and management in all countries. And in total, SDG 11 focuses on all residents' satisfaction with urban function (transportation, health care, etc.) or environment (air, water and soil). So, SDG 11 is consistent with S2 and E4 in both the indicator layer and the target layer (Table 4  ).  5.3 Apply assessment results into rapidly urbanization coastal cities To maintain positive momentum in ecological civilization and sustainability, in the immediate future it is important to critically engage within an integrated management network for coastal zone landscape based on land-water-biodiversity nexus. The LWB (Land-Water-Biodiversity) nexus, an innovative environmental management framework derived from catastrophe theory, prioritizes the interconnections between its components of urban ecosystems, water systems and creatures across scales (Wang et al., 2018 ). It is similar to the concept of biogeochemistry, a key aspect of urban ecology, which argues vegetation and water stand in close relation to land change in the urban ecosystem. Whereas in this paper we focus more on the correlation among land, water and biodiversity instead of their causality. Land is the foundation of water and organisms, water facilitates the mass cycle and energy flows, and biodiversity is the carrier of both. Only when we admit the LWB nexus a key node in the social-ecological framework, will we find out a new path toward urban resilience. As Fig. 2   shows, resilience, SDGs and LWB nexus are core mechanisms in applying this model, representing the theory base, final targets and innovative pattern respectively. Furthermore, the incorporation of diverse social-ecological systems guides us in the right direction to the achievements of sustainable development goals. The stability of a city system is the harmony of all its functions and dynamics (Bai et al., 2016 ; Donohue et al., 2016 ), trust between individuals, information sharing and public private partnership (PPP) is the key impetus of supply chain network recovery subsequent to risk or crisis (Papadopoulos et al., 2017 ). Even though, when the government actually formulates and enforces urban planning programs, it often neglects the connection and correspondence between systems. Therefore, constituting a communication network for planners, policymakers and managers at both national and international scales provides new ideas for improving the resilience and sustainability of urban agglomerations (Elmqvist et al., 2019 ; Kremen, 2005 ; McPhearson et al., 2016 ; Zhong et al., 2018 ). In 2007, Biermann (Biermann, 2007 ) presented the Earth System Governance Project, which can be understood as the sum of myriad public and private non-state actors at all levels of decision-making, to ensure the co-evolution of human and natural systems in a sustainable way, accordingly jointly resisting climate changes. In another word, global climate change calls for truly collaborative and integrative research, which appreciates the strengths and limitations of different knowledge domains, approaches and perspectives (Brondizio et al., 2016 ). Coastal areas, especially river deltas areas, concentrate most of the world's mega-cities (Thorne et al., 2018 ), where urbanization and population growth appear unique geographical characteristics. However, how to balance urban economic development and ecosystem protection is a universal and tricky problem for all cities. Theoretically, indicators in the resilience assessment are corresponding to three basic modules in modern environment management, the social-economic, natural resources and ecological environment respectively. Namely, both the framework and indicators are general dealing with global issues. Empirically, Dapeng District is selected as a specific case study for its significance in land-sea integrated and sustainable development and its ecological superiority among all administrative regions in Shenzhen city as well. Besides, Shenzhen city, the first port city influenced by the Reform and Opening up policy in China, is also representative among all the global coastal cities undergoing rapid urbanization. Therefore, promoting the experience learned from Dapeng to other coastal area depends on extending and refining the resilience matrix locally. In short, this paper come up with a land-water-biodiversity nexus coastal zone system governance model, enhancing the ability of urban agglomerations to respond to risks, recover and adapt to hazard quickly.   6 Conclusions In the context of the deteriorating global coastal zone, this paper takes the Dapeng New District of Shenzhen city as a sample to explore how coastal cities respond to the habitat destruction under the endogenous pressure of rapid urbanization, as well as coordinate economic development and ecological civilization construction. The main contributions of the papers are: (1) The resilience matrix we proposed broadens the scope of resilience, reshapes the conceptual connection between the social and ecological system, and stresses the integration of land and sea as well. After evaluation, Dapeng New District, with its flaws in the recovery and adaptive stages, offers us new ideas on how to improve resilience based on LWB nexus. (2) Comparing to existing resilience assessment tools, we are trying to find a common and universal solution for evaluation by conducting empirical researches in different regions. (3) In the consideration of characteristics of coastal cities, this paper comes up with a land-water-biodiversity nexus coastal zone system governance model, enhancing the ability of urban agglomerations to respond to risks, recover and adapt to hazard quickly. To measure distance and progress to SDGs, the assessment should be linked to baseline data in the existing database and identify the trends and gaps, that is why establishing and maintaining system resilience requires continuous dynamic monitoring instead of only one assessment tool. To this end, the resilience assessment tool in this paper provides the benchmark performance scores to determine the future direction and shortcomings of cities under SDGs in times to come. Succinctly, this evaluation system offers an outlook on the limitations of resilience practice and endeavors to inspire a discussion toward a resilient and sustainable coastal city. The linked interactions of social and ecological systems in coastal areas can be applied through Land-Water-Biodiversity nexus, which guides decision-makers to consider the target city holistically with physical substrates and organisms, as well as anthropogenic effects. We suggest that conceptual advances within urban resilience and sustainability have created the potential to transform the future coastal cities into a more magnificent ecosystem. An integrated science of cities, for example, the LWB nexus, will enhance, refine and embrace the existing conceptual framework in perusing a more sustainable and resilient urban system. To clarify the correlation between sub-systems in the coastal zone, to apply the long-term research and big data in resilience planning, or to visualize the resilience are some possible ways to embed LWB nexus into empirical environment management. Confined to the available database, a three-year resilience score was calculated in Dapeng District. Next, using panel data of recent decades in Dapeng to evaluate its resilience can help to improve the habitat quality index framework and the assessment model based on LWB nexus. Looking into the future, the United Nation will set further SDGs for vision 2030. Applying new goals into coastal urban area management, taking Dapeng as a pilot, and proposing an integration scheme is suggested.

Appendix 1 Definitions of the indicators or resilience matrix GRP per capita (S1): Gross regional production (GRP) per capita is calculated by dividing GRP over a region's population. Worldwide it is used by economists alongside GDP to analyze the prosperity of a country and its economic growth. GRP per unit of development land (S2): is calculated by dividing GRP over total area of development land, including land for residential, administration and public services, commercial and business facilities, industry and manufacture, logistics and warehouse, road, street and transportation, municipal utilities, green space and square. The increment of strategic emerging industries accounts for the proportion of GRP (S3): Strategic emerging industries are based on major technological breakthroughs and major development needs, and have a major leading role in the overall economic and social development and long-term development, for example renewable energy, IoT (internet of things), Nano materials, aerospace technology and so on. The increment of the marine industry accounts for the proportion of GRP (S4): Marine industry refers to the industry sector that develop, utilize and conserve marine resources and spaces, including fisheries, oil and gas extraction and so on. Energy consumption per unit GRP (N1): is calculated by dividing GRP over total energy consumption. Forest coverage (N2): refers to the relative (in percent) or sure (in square kilometers/square miles) land area that is covered by forests or the forest canopy or open woodland. Renewable resource recycling rate (N3): refers to the percentage of renewable resources in the total volume. Natural shoreline conservation rate (N4): is the percentage of natural shoreline in the total shoreline. In addition to the coastal line, the natural shoreline also includes the shorelines of rivers and lakes. It refers to the sloping zone and corresponding waters within a certain length specified in the governmental plan. Percent of attainment days meeting good air quality standard (E1): refers to the days which AQI (Air Quality Index) reach level “Good” according to GB 3095-2012 “Ambient air quality standard”. Ratio of marine areas meeting grade I ~ II water quality standard (E2): refers to the percentage of areas where water quality meet the I ~ II standard according to GB 3097–1997 “Sea Water quality standard”.

So, in this paper we take the score of S1 as 100. ② Although the file Index of Marine Ecological Civilization Pilot (on trial) (2012) emphasize the necessity of marine industry, department of marine protection in Dapeng has not made specific goal and plan, which is also one of defects in the assessment results.
