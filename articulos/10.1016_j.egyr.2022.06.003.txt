                  This study presents a method to develop a series of unique deliverability smart models for underground natural gas storage (UNGS) in different types of target formations. The natural gas supply loop is defined by periodic mismatches between demand and supply. Efficient and faster approaches for forecasting UNGS deliverability may not only assist stakeholders but also the competitive natural gas industry. Due to this fact, this article suggests a series of robust deliverability estimation models for 387 UNGS sites in depleted fields, aquifers, and salt domes based on rigorous machine learning (ML) techniques. To this end, the potential of three ML algorithms, including Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM), and Extra Tree (ET), is employed. To assess and compare the proposed models, statistical parameters including coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and standard deviation (SD) were employed. Accordingly, in the case of depleted fields, the GPR, LSSVM, and ET paradigms show overall R2, RMSE, and MAE of 0.999999998, 4.75E−06, 0.00021, and 0.00021. For salt domes, the GPR, LSSVM, and ET models indicate overall R2, RMSE, and MAE of 0.987, 0.0046, and 0.11. Finally, for aquifers, the GPR, LSSVM, and ET algorithms represent overall R2, RMSE, and MAE of 0.999999997, 7.1094E−06, and 0.0002102. The prediction performance reveals that the GPR model is superior to the LSSVM and ET models. This study found that the proposed intelligent models could be utilized as a template for fast estimating the deliverability of UNGS in depleted fields, aquifers, and salt domes with high accuracy. In the end, the outcomes of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the critical role of machine learning in resolving the difficulty of forecasting the UNSG on cleaner production and sustainable development strategies.

Fig. 2 The location of field storage data was generated by EIA (EIA, 2021a ).    Fig. 3 The schematic of workflow was used for this machine learning study.    Fig. 4 The generated Gaussian process regression (GPR) model’s relative error distribution for estimating the MDD in a depleted field.    Fig. 5 The developed intelligent systems’ cumulative frequency curve predicts the MDD in a depleted field.    Fig. 6 The established Gaussian process regression (GPR) model’s relative error distribution predicts the maximum daily delivery in a salt dome.    Fig. 7 The cumulative frequency graph of the intelligent systems was established to approximate the maximum daily delivery in a salt dome.    Fig. 8 The Gaussian process regression (GPR) model’s relative error distribution approximates an aquifer’s maximum daily delivery.    Fig. 9 The cumulative frequency graph of the intelligent systems was established to approximate the maximum daily delivery in a salt dome.

This study presents a method to develop a series of unique deliverability smart models for underground natural gas storage (UNGS) in different types of target formations. The natural gas supply loop is defined by periodic mismatches between demand and supply. Efficient and faster approaches for forecasting UNGS deliverability may not only assist stakeholders but also the competitive natural gas industry. Due to this fact, this article suggests a series of robust deliverability estimation models for 387 UNGS sites in depleted fields, aquifers, and salt domes based on rigorous machine learning (ML) techniques. To this end, the potential of three ML algorithms, including Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM), and Extra Tree (ET), is employed. To assess and compare the proposed models, statistical parameters including coefficient of determination (R2 ), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and standard deviation (SD) were employed. Accordingly, in the case of depleted fields, the GPR, LSSVM, and ET paradigms show overall R2 , RMSE, and MAE of 0.999999998, 4.75E−06, 0.00021, and 0.00021. For salt domes, the GPR, LSSVM, and ET models indicate overall R2 , RMSE, and MAE of 0.987, 0.0046, and 0.11. Finally, for aquifers, the GPR, LSSVM, and ET algorithms represent overall R2 , RMSE, and MAE of 0.999999997, 7.1094E−06, and 0.0002102. The prediction performance reveals that the GPR model is superior to the LSSVM and ET models. This study found that the proposed intelligent models could be utilized as a template for fast estimating the deliverability of UNGS in depleted fields, aquifers, and salt domes with high accuracy. In the end, the outcomes of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the critical role of machine learning in resolving the difficulty of forecasting the UNSG on cleaner production and sustainable development strategies.

Nevertheless, in transportation and natural gas consumption, there are variations in the gas deliverability of particular storage (Zhang et al., 2021a,b ). Primarily, there will be difficulties in gas consumption during the seasonal winter when extreme weather prevents the transportation pipeline from carrying long distances. Due to this fact, underground natural gas storage is recommended as a promising way to balance supply and demand for energy security (Wang et al., 2020 ). Also, natural gas is recognized as the cleanest fuel among coal and oil (Tahmasebi et al., 2020 ). Thus, UNGS is required to improve the long-term gas market (Blanco and Faaij, 2018 ). Compared to large containers constrained to limitation holding pressures for storing natural gas on the ground, deep UNGS benefits from storing natural gas at high-pressure conditions (Ali, 2021 ). Therefore, it could store an immense amount of natural gas and improve storage efficiency. At present, UNGS in a depleted field has been estimated as the most potential of natural gas storage globally, an aquifer reservoir stands for the second-largest UNGS place, and salt dome represents for third-largest UNGS spot (Zhang et al., 2021a,b ). The first successful depleted reservoir for UNGS was constructed in Canada’s Welland depleted gas field in 1915 (Mgbaja and Enwere, 2017 ). Nowadays, 925 UNGS sites have been established globally (IGU, 2018 ). With the increasing number of underground storage sites in recent years, UNGS is reasonably viable in the sustainable energy strategy (Evans, 2007 ). Recap: Different volume metrics are utilized to investigate the essential features of UNGS facilities (Wang and Economides, 2012 ). Among these crucial volumetric metrics, deliverability is used to distinguish the UNGS facilities, determined as the measured rate at which gas can be withdrawn from being injected into storage wells (Goel et al., 2012 ). Therefore, the accurate prediction of deliverability is a key to bringing UNGS into the sustainable energy strategy. To date, most of the UNGS studies have converted from reservoir engineering to simulating and predicting the operation performance of target reservoirs (Zhang et al., 2021a,b ). Generally, physics-based reservoir simulation is a standard method in the petroleum industry for approximating the performance of UNGS projects (Gumrah et al., 2005 ). However, this physic-based reservoir simulation is arduous, and execution is tedious. To solve this problem, ML approaches were considered an alternative option to provide fast and accurate results for predicting the reservoir performance in the hydrocarbon field (Ahmadi et al., 2018; Al-Mudhafar, 2020; Ghassemzadeh et al., 2021; Vo Thanh et al., 2020 ). Besides, utilizing the massive subsurface data in the petroleum sector created during field exploration, exploitation, UNGS, and other processes, machine learning models  could be adapted in the petroleum sector to expose the treasured information consisting of such massive data (Shahkarami and Mohaghegh, 2020 ). Over the last few decades, ML techniques have been considered for solving many prediction issues in the energy science, petroleum engineering, and environmental engineering disciplines (Amasyali and El-Gohary, 2021; Ma et al., 2020; Safaei-Farouji et al., 2022; Safaei-Farouji and Kadkhodaie, 2021, 2022; Vo Thanh et al., 2019, 2022; Woo et al., 2020 ). Recently, the Gaussian process regression (GPR) technique has demonstrated its efficiency in many studies. Mahdaviara et al. (2021)  proposed the GPR method to predict permeability in various carbonate formations with an R 2     value of 0.98. Vo Thanh and Lee (2021)  developed smart predictive models using GPR, random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) to predict CO2  trapping efficiency in deep underground saline aquifers. Their study found that GPR outperformed the remaining ML methods with excellent accuracy in fitting simulation results to real-field data. Zhou et al. (2021)  proposed that the GPR model could provide highly accurate results in evaluating long-term and short-term solar radiation with excellent results in statistical indicators. Also, Li et al. (2020)  used GPR to develop an online air quality warning system that relied on data streams and was intended to be used in environmental sustainability. In the application of petroleum exploration, Noori et al. (2020)  applied GPR to seismic fault detection on synthetic and real field data. Their study indicated that the GPR model could provide similar prediction results to the conventional method. Gönül et al. (2021)  proposed GPR scheme to predict the formation rate of oil dilution caused by following injections in diesel vehicles. Most recently, Safaei-Farouji et al. (2022)  proposed a series of machine learning models for prediction of CO2 /brine interfacial tension to be applied to carbon geo-sequestration. Their study found that the GPR model could provide better prediction results than the radial basis function approach. Also, the LSSVM robust model has been successfully employed in various applications. Chen et al. (2021)  proposed that the LSSVM has outstanding predictive performance for building energy consumption, reaching an accurate forecast with a R2  of 0.95 and a RMSE of 0.027. Lv et al. (2013)  considered LSSVM for estimating NOx emissions from a coal-fired boiler with high accuracy prediction performance. Additionally, Yuan et al. (2015)  proposed the LSSVM model for improving the accuracy of prediction in short-term wind power. Razavi et al. (2018)  demonstrated that LSSVM can be employed as a robust and reliable method for estimation of natural gas density. Furthermore, LSSVM could be regarded as a smart model for estimating density in bitumen and heavy n-alkane mixtures (Haghighi and Nabipour, 2018 ). They concluded that the LSSVM technique could be applied to various aspects of the oil and gas market. In the most recent study, Alizadeh et al. (2021)  applied LSSVM and optimization techniques to develop a robust prediction of drilling fluid density at reservoir conditions. Their findings indicated that the developed LSSVM model could achieve the excellent prediction result of R2  of 0.999. Regarding the ET application, this innovative model has been implemented in numerous prediction studies. The ET model could utilize these parameters for estimation of the bubble boil pressure and oil formation volume factor (Seyyedattar et al., 2020 ). Their work indicated the ET provided excellent prediction results with fewer input parameters than the correlation approach. Also, ET can be employed for wax disappearance temperature to estimate the precipitation in the pipeline (Amiri-Ramsheh et al., 2021 ). Moreover, ET was also used to predict the oil recovery performance of low salinity injections in petroleum reservoirs (Kondori et al., 2021 ). Ahmad et al. (2018)  proposed ET, RF, and SVM for estimating PV power generation. This work stated that the ET and RF could be applied as parameter selection models. Besides, ET could provide faster prediction results than other ML models. Recently, Li et al. (2022)  applied ET for estimation of the interfacial disturbance wave velocity. In this research, it was found that the ET achieved excellent prediction results with a mean absolute percentage error of less than 20%. Despite the promising results of using ML methods in the energy sector, it is essential to note that in the petroleum industry, more attention is being paid to formations that have not yet been transformed to UNGS, and those extractable natural formations are being exploited. These formations are typically described as oil and natural gas-depleted reservoirs, aquifers, and salt domes (Tahmasebi et al., 2020 ). In other aspects, a deeper analysis of the literature review indicates a limitation of research that considers the ML techniques to approximate the accuracy and deliverability of UNGS in geological formations. To address this problem, our work considers GPR, LSSVM, and ET to predict the deliverability for USA underground storage sites comprising depleted fields, aquifers, and salt domes. This article selected the three robust ML models because they demonstrated effectiveness and robust prediction in the above-mentioned studies. The robustness, accurate prediction, and unique insights of GPR, LSSVM, and ET methods help us get a more holistic knowledge of the deliverability of UNGS for a diversity of storage formations. The main differences between this study and previous research are as follows: (1) rigorous machine learning schemes were developed, and they demonstrated robust prediction performance; (2) a large and diverse databank was considered for the generation of smart models; (3) previous studies used reservoir simulation in a single storage formation, whereas this study used a large scale database with different types of reservoir characteristics; and (4) this work was considered only three input features to develop the smart models with high accuracy. In the following sections, firstly, the motivation and description of predicting deliverability in UNGS are presented. Then, materials and methods, including data gathering for UNSG and the theory of powerful ML techniques, are described. Next, results and discussion of the ML models developed are highlighted. Finally, the summary and conclusions deliver further research’s essential findings and directions. Fig. 1  displays the general sketch of problem in the presented study.    2 Motivation and description of predicting deliverability in UNGS This research is inspired by a study by Tek, who suggested the importance of defining the deliverability of underground natural gas storage (Tek, 1989 ). This scholar found that the well production and back pressure are two critical parameters to determine deliverability in storage sites. In addition, Rawlins and Schellhardt (1935)  proposed the calculation of the well’s deliverability using the following equation: (1) q = C P  f  2   P  b  2      n       Where P  b     represents the wellhead pressure (back pressure), P  f     stands for shut in formation pressure, q   denotes the well’s deliverability in the storage reservoir. C   and n   are empirical parameters. As described in Eq. (1) , the differential between the reservoir pressure and the working pressure at the wellhead determines a well’s capacity to transport natural gas production. To put it another way, for the deliverability of a natural gas formation, the reservoir’s formation pressure must be high enough to push natural gas through the reservoir into the well-bore (Rawlins and Schellhardt, 1935 ). Moreover, the fundamental concept of a UGNS in storage formations engages renewing the reservoir before injecting the gas for generating an efficient underground pressurized holder (Letcher, 2016 ). The greater the pressure in the geological formations UNGS, as in newly drilling wells, the more easily natural gas can be extracted. No pressure differential will be needed to force the natural gas out of geological formations once the pressure declines below the wellhead’s (Ali, 2021 ). Therefore, two critical variables that calculate the deliverability of UNGS in geological formations are base gas and working gas. These two parameters are combined with total natural gas storage capacity to provide a solution to estimate the deliverability of UNGS in geological formations. This idea aligns with the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA, 2021a ). This organization was generated the monthly field of natural gas storage database considering the following three parameters (EIA, 2021b ): Total natural gas storage capacity : the highest volume of natural gas that can be stored in an underground storage infrastructure in agreement with its design, which includes the reservoir characterization, installed facility and working process in the specific place. Base gas:   The volume or proportion of gas defined as permanent inventory in a storage site to manage enough pressure and deliverability rates during the withdrawal period. Working gas capacity  represents total gas storage capacity minus base gas. The above three parameters would be used as the input features for the construction of the ML models to predict the deliverability of UNGS in USA geological formations. The details of materials and methods to accomplish this goal are presented in the next section.  3 Data and methodology 3.1 Data collection The data gathering is the initial step of constructing a predictive ML model. The databank implemented in this article to estimate the UNGS’s deliverability are adapted from the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA) (EIA, 2021a ). The monthly field storage natural gas storage comprises 387 sites for 2020 and 2021, including field depleted, saline aquifers and salt domes located in six USA regions. The details of data points could be reached in the supplement material. Fig. 2  depicts the location of all geological formations for UNGS in the USA. As mentioned in Section 2 , three variables, including total field storage capacity, base gas, and working gas capacity, were considered input features to approximate the maximum daily delivery of UNGS. Furthermore, Table 1  summarizes the statistical characterization of input and output parameters with the minimum, maximum and mean values for depleted reservoirs, aquifers and salt domes. This data will be separated as 80% data samples for training ML models, while the remaining samples would be considered for testing the ML performance in terms of predicting the deliverability of three storage formations.     3.2 Methodology Fig. 3  illustrates the entire workflow for research and the entire workflow for this article. Firstly, the data is collected from multiple storage sites in the USA. Then, input features are considered base gas, working gas capacity, and total field capacity, while the output is the deliverability of various storage formations. The dataset is divided into training and testing with 80% and 20%, respectively. These training and testing groups will be employed in three machine learning models, namely GPR, LSSVM, and ET. By considering several statistical indicators, the best ML model will be determined for sensitivity analysis. Finally, the relevancy factor is utilized for the determination of the most impactful variable for the optimal ML model.  It should be noted that before employing the machine learning approaches in this study, because of the substantially high numerical values of the dataset, it was normalized between 0 and 1 to prevent any errors and gain reasonable results in subsequent procedures. The details of tuning parameters and the theory’s machine learning model are described in the subsection. 3.2.1 Hyper-parameter tuning To achieve optimal results, machine learning architectures’ hyper-parameters must be adjusted. The default hyper-parameter values are inadequate to guarantee that machine-learning methodologies work efficiently. Accordingly, it is vital to determine the best hyper-parameters while building machine learning systems (Schratz et al., 2019 ). There are various approaches for hyper-parameter optimization, some of which are employed in this paper discussed here. Random search (RS) is an effective strategy for optimizing hyperparameters. The selected hyper-parameters are mixed in any sequence or according to any criteria in this approach (Torres et al., 2019 ). The GPR and ET methods are those for which the random search approach was used to adjust their hyper-parameters. Grid search (GS) is another method implemented to tune the hyper-parameters of the GPR system. This approach extensively searches for all specified hyper-parameters (Torres et al., 2019 ).  3.2.2 Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) The Gaussian Process approach was first proposed and executed in the late 1940s. In the mid-1990s, this method was introduced into machine learning (Bernardo et al., 1998 ). The Gaussian Process (GP) method’s remarkable efficiency was proven by a series of computer simulations. GPR’s ability to process multi-dimensional data with a small number of samples and non-linear problems is a significant advantage (Dudley, 2010 ). For the most part, the GP is a collection of random parameters in which a limited set of these random variables have a joint Gaussian distribution. Covariance (kernel function) and a mean function are used to identify Gaussian processes (GP) (Paciorek and Mark, 2003 ). The detailed steps involved in the GPR algorithm have been provided as an appendix. Table 2  summarizes the parameters established for creating the GPR model.    3.2.3 Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) Substituted for support vector machines, the LSSVM is a variation of the SVM suggested by Suykens and Vandewalle (1999) . LSSVM is a set of related supervised learning algorithms employed for regression and classification problems to examine the dataset and detect relationships. Traditional SVMs could be solved using linear formulas instead of convex quadratic programming (QP). A regression error is introduced to the optimization variables in this enhanced LSSVM version. Indeed, in SVM procedures, regression error can be minimized in the learning phase, whereas in LSSVM approaches, it is theoretically specified and addressed (Van Gestel et al., 2003 ). The penalized function formulation utilized in the LSSVM is shown in the subsequent statements. The set parameters for the LSSVM framework are given in Table 3 . The LSSVM strategy’s objective reduction premise could be stated as follows (Forrester et al., 2008 ): (2) Minimize  1  2   w  t   w + 1  2   γ ∑  i = 1  N   ( e  i  2   )     (3) subjected to  y  i   = w  φ  T   x  i     + b + e  i   , i = 1 , 2 , … , N          3.2.4 Extra Tree (ET) The extra tree concept employs an averaging mechanism on the decision trees predictions in order to boost reliability and minimize operating challenges (Geurts et al., 2006; Wehenkel et al., 2006 ). In that case, a randomized mechanism is employed to create a series of trees, and their projections are aggregated suitably via techniques such as arithmetic averaging in regression or majority voting in classification. The ET approach employs random cut positions to carry out the node splitting mechanism. This is how the ET technique is distinguished from existing tree-based machine learning classifiers. A bootstrap replica is used to reverse-expand the trees across the entire learning sample. Two critical factors are involved in the additional tree splitting strategy: the rate of randomized splits at each neuron (K) as well as the minimum sample size (n  min    ) applied to break up the nodes for division (Geurts et al., 2006; Wehenkel et al., 2006 ). To construct a tree, the K factor needs to be found for each node, and this technique must be continued until the tree sprouts leaves. The total number of learning sets is less than the minimum criterion (Wehenkel et al., 2006 ). Extra trees are developed to diminish variation appropriately by utilizing a random combination of cut points, input attributes, and group averaging. Meanwhile, additional trees could lower bias by utilizing the complete initial learning sample (Geurts et al., 2006 ). With the training dataset, X =   x 1.x 2...x N, in which the sample x i =   f 1.f (2....)...f D is a D-dimensional vector consisting of f j as the feature and j1.2.....D as the training dataset. Extra trees are used to form M unique decision trees. Sp denotes the proportion of the training dataset X at each decision tree’s child node p. The additional tree then selects the optimal split associated with Sp as well as a randomly generated portion of attributes at each node p (Acosta et al., 2020 ). It should be noted that the random search method applied for hyper parameter tuning in the extra tree (ET) model defined 1 mean leaf size and 30 mean parent sizes as the optimum hyper parameters in data from the depleted field and aquifer. On the other hand, the optimum numbers for the mean leaf size and mean parent size were set at 1 and 10 for the case of the salt dome data, respectively.   3.3 Model validation and assessment Appraisal and verification are critical steps in the development of machine learning systems. Herein, the coefficient of determination (R2 ), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and standard deviation (SD) were used to compare machine learning outcomes. The following are the formulas for the statistical parameters used: (4) R  2   = 1 − ∑  i = 1  n   ( T a r g e t − O u t p u t )   2    ∑  i = 1  n   ( O u t p u t − T a r g e t  ( m e a n )  )   2        (5) RMSE = 1  n   ∑  i = 1  n   ( T a r g e t − O u t p u t )   2        (6) MAE = 1  n   ∑  i = 1  n   | O u t p u t − T a r g e t |     (7) S D = 1  n − 1   ∑  i = 1  n   ( V s e x p   − V s c a l    V s ( e x p )    )   2           here n  clarifies the overall number of a dataset. Additionally, the relevancy factor (r) was calculated to analyze the relationship between the inputs and outputs. The following formula was utilized to calculate the relevancy factor (r  ) for input data: (8) r i n p u t  k   , o u t p u t    = ∑  i = 1  n   ( i n p u t  k , i   − i n p u t  a v e , k   )  ( o u t p u t  i   − o u t p u t  a v e   )   ∑  i = 1  n   ( i n p u t  k , i   − i n p u t  a v e , k   )   2   ∑  i = 1  n   ( o u t p u t  i   − o u t p u t  a v e   )   2            while output  i     demonstrates the value of i  th estimated output, output  a v e     implies the mean value of approximated MDD. Input  k , i     displays the i  th quantity of the k  th input factor, while Input  a v e , k     displays the mean amount of the k  th input variable (Barati-Harooni et al., 2019 ).   4 Results and discussion 4.1 Evaluating the reliability and accuracy of the models designed for approximating Maximum Daily Delivery (MDD) in a depleted field Table 4  summarizes the obtained values of the statistical parameters computed for train, test, and total data. In general, as can be observed, all approaches applied show excellent outcomes. However, the superior power of the GPR model over other techniques used is notable. As is provided in Table 4  and figure A1, the maximum overall coefficient of determination (R2 ) (0.999999998) was achieved for the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model. Likewise, the GPR scheme indicated the minimum overall RMSE and MAE (1.82E−05) as well as SD (0.00021) errors (Table 4 , Figure A2&3 ). On the other hand, the LSSVM and ET models clarify relatively similar performance. The obtained overall R 2     for the LSSVM method is 0.999758, while it is 0.999573 for the ET model (Table 4 , Figure A1 ). Also, the calculated RMSE and MAE for the LSSVM approach is 0.0019, whereas it is 0.0016 for the ET model (Table 4 , Figure A2 ). LSSVM and ET also demonstrate a standard deviation (SD) of 0.08838 and 0.0378, respectively (Table 4 , Figure A3 ). Correspondingly, based on the achieved overall errors and coefficient of determination, the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model constructed can be introduced as the best model for predicting the MDD in a depleted field with a marked improvement over other models developed.  Figure B  illustrates the graphs of the intelligent systems used to estimate the maximum daily delivery in a depleted field. These diagrams compare predicted values to actual values of the maximum daily delivery. The optimal model line is visualized as an X =   Y straight line connecting the actual and anticipated values. The points on the plot grow nearer to the straight line as the model’s performance progresses. It is evident from these results that the estimates of the three smart algorithms utilized reflect a high degree of conformity near the unit slope line. Nevertheless, as illustrated in Figure B1 , the GPR model gives datasets closer to the straight line than those produced by other ML techniques. As a result, the superiority of the GPR framework in estimating MDD in a depleted field can be inferred in contrast to other applied systems. Also, the relatively similar performance of the LSSVM (Figure B2 ) and ET (Figure B3 ) can be deduced. Fig. 4  presents the error distribution diagram for the constructed GPR as the strongest predictor. The relative error (RE) numbers are displayed versus the target’s real MDD values. In this illustration, the system is more precise if the errors are contained in a more compressed zone across the line of zero error. Apparently, all training and testing data can be found along with the relative error zero line (RE). This demonstrates the created GPR network’s remarkable precision.  Furthermore, the cumulative frequency of the root mean square error (RMSE) for the systems employed in the current research is demonstrated in Fig. 5 . At a glance, the superior power of the GPR machine learning approach used for estimating the maximum daily delivery in a depleted field can be proven. To explain, there is not a notable variance in the achieved RMSE values for the GPR model. This indicates the superb performance of this model. Indeed, the GPR system could estimate almost 100% of the maximum daily delivery dataset with RMSE values of less than about 6.39 × 10−5 . On the other hand, a broad disparity in measured RMSE values for the extra tree (ET) model can be observed; thus, the lower power of the ET model than other systems can be concluded. As illustrated in Fig. 5 , the LSSVM paradigm could approximate roughly 10% of the maximum daily delivery data with RMSE values lower than 0.0018. Surprisingly, the LSSVM model could approximate nearly 90% of the remaining data with stable RMSE values of around 0.002. Collectively, substantially lower values of RMSE and a lack of variance in values of this error parameter for the GPR model demonstrate the considerably better performance of this model in comparison with other utilized methods of LSSVM and ET.    4.2 Evaluation of the reliability and accuracy of the models designed for approximating maximum daily delivery in a salt dome Table 5  provides data on the values of the statistical parameters measured to evaluate the developed models. Additionally, Figure C  compares the models illustratively. A glance at the table and figure provided reveals several apparent differences between the performances of the methods established. Similar to the smart models employed for estimation of maximum daily delivery in a depleted field, it is the GPR model that could estimate the MDD in a salt dome with the highest overall coefficient of determination (R2 ) (0.987) (Table 5 , Figure C1 ). However, in marked contrast, the minimum overall R2  belongs to the LSSVM model (0.898) (Table 5 , Figure C1 ). The tree-based extra tree (ET) method also denotes a relatively similar R2  value (0.911) to the LSSSVM model (Table 5 , Figure C1 ). Regarding error values (RMSE, MAE, and SD), again, it is the GPR model that demonstrates its superior power over other models developed. With overall RMSE, MAE, and SD values of 0.004, 0.004, and 0.11, the GPR model has the minimum errors (Table 5 , Figure C1&2 ). However, other models of the LSSVM and ET mark relatively similar error values. The LSSVM model indicates the overall RMSE and MAE values of 0.0233, whilst these error values for the ET model are 0.0235 (Table 5 , Figure C2&3 ). Therefore, according to the measured total errors and R 2     values, the GPR model established can be recognized as the optimum model in estimating the MDD in a salt dome.  Figure D  denotes the plots of the actual values of the MDD versus its estimated values in a salt dome. As shown in the figure, the GPR model (Figure D1 ) has better performance than the LSSVM (Figure D2 ) and ET (Figure D3 ) as a result of its data being located near the unit slope line. Meanwhile, a higher disparity in data from LSSVM and ET plots can be observed. Thus, the higher power of the GPR system in predicting the maximum daily delivery in a salt dome can be further supported. Fig. 6  illustrates the error distribution diagram for the GPR model as the most potent predictor in approximating the MDD in a salt dome. This graph demonstrates that all train and test data are very close to the relative zero error line. This diagram corroborates previous findings and typifies the constructed GPR network’s considerable precision.  To further analyze the performance of the intelligent ML techniques designed to estimate the MDD in a salt dome, the cumulative frequency of the root mean square error (RMSE) for each model is provided in Fig. 7 . According to this graph, the GPR scheme could predict approximately 94% of the maximum daily delivery dataset in a salt dome with RMSE values lower than roughly 0.01. However, the LSSVM and ET models show relatively similar and weaker performance than the GPR. In contrast to the GPR, the LSSVM and ET methods could estimate nearly 94% of the MDD dataset in a salt dome with RMSE values of about 0.098. Finally, this diagram again demonstrates the better performance of the GPR model than others, a conclusion that was made in previous sections via other analyses.    4.3 Evaluation of the reliability and accuracy of the models designed for approximating maximum daily delivery in an aquifer Table 6  denotes the obtained values of the statistical parameters employed to evaluate the constructed models. Figure E , furthermore, compares the models graphically. As shown in the table and figure, all three paradigms of the GPR, LSSVM, and ET were capable of estimating the maximum daily delivery in an aquifer with high accuracy. However, the GPR model shows better performance than other models. This system could approximate the target with an excellent overall coefficient of determination (0.999999997). Following that, the LSSVM model ranked second, and its overall coefficient of determination (0.99997) was higher than that of the ET model (0.99925) (Table 6 , Figure E1 ). Nonetheless, relatively similar performances for the LSSVM and GPR can be deduced. With regard to error values achieved, again, it is the GPR intelligent model that outperforms other models and demonstrates the minimum error values (Table 6 , figure* E2& 3 ). It should be noted that there is a marked contrast between the error values of the GPR system and those of the LSSVM and ET. The GPR scheme could predict the maximum daily delivery in an aquifer with an overall RMSE and MAE of 0.00000710 (Table 6 , Figure E2 ). On the other hand, the computed overall RMSE and MAE for the LSSVM system is 0.0023. Although showing a relatively similar RMSE value, the ET model denotes a bit higher RMSE and MAE values (0.0051) than the LSSVM (Table 6 , Figure E2 ). The measured SD values further confirm the substantially better performance of the GPR system than others. Indeed, the GPR model could estimate the target with an overall SD value of 0.0002. However, the ET indicates the lower overall SD value (0.042) after the GPR method, while the LSSVM demonstrates the overall SD value of 0.095 (Table 6 , Figure E3 ). Collectively, according to the obtained overall errors and coefficient of determination, the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) smart model is the best model for estimating the maximum daily delivery in an aquifer. It is worth mentioning that, based on the reached errors and coefficient of determination values discussed in previous sections, the GPR model also indicated better performance than other models in approximating the maximum daily delivery in a depleted field and salt dome.  The graphs in Figure F  show the actual and predicted values of the maximum daily delivery in an aquifer. As can be observed, it can be claimed that all the models developed could predict the target with high accuracy as the majority of their data is situated near the unit slope line. However, the GPR technique could approximate the target with higher accuracy than other models because almost all its data is located on the unit slope line (Figure F1) . In contrast, a slight data disparity can be seen for the LSSVM model (Figure F2),  even though this disparity is lower than that of the ET model (Figure F3) . Furthermore, Fig. 8  denotes the error distribution graph for the GPR model that was recognized as the best model for predicting the maximum daily delivery in an aquifer. As shown in this plot, the entire train and test dataset are very close to the relative zero error line. This confirms previous findings and suggests the designed GPR model’s notable accuracy.  Also, the cumulative frequency of the root mean square error (RMSE) for the models developed is shown in Fig. 9 . At a glance, the exceptionally high accuracy of the GPR model is proven. More specifically, there is no notable difference in the obtained RMSE values for the GPR model. This indicates the excellent performance of this system. Indeed, the GPR system could estimate almost 100% of the maximum daily delivery dataset with RMSE values of less than 0.00028. Additionally, the LSSVM could estimate about 96% of the data with RMSE values lower than nearly 0.0023. This diagram also clarifies that there is relatively no fluctuation in the RMSE values of the LSSVM model for about 96% of the dataset. In stark contrast, the ET system demonstrates a wide disparity in RMSE values. According to Fig. 8 , the ET model could approximate roughly 72% of the data with RMSE values of approximately 0.0024. This means that this model could predict the remaining 28% of the data with RMSE values higher than 0.0024. Accordingly, Fig. 9  further supported the superiority of the GPR model over others in estimating the maximum daily delivery in an aquifer.  As was proven in previous sections, the Gaussian process regression (GPR) was the most powerful technique in estimating the maximum daily delivery in a depleted field, salt dome, and aquifer. This ML algorithm has several characteristics that make it a powerful framework. This algorithm is efficient in processing non-linear, high-dimension, and limited samples. Additionally, in comparison with support vector machines and artificial neural networks, GPR is capable of being adapted and generalized (Dudley, 2010 ).  4.4 Sensitivity analysis As discussed earlier, three parameters of the base gas, working gas capacity, and total field capacity were used as input parameters to estimate maximum daily delivery in a depleted field, salt dome, and aquifer. To rank and investigate the effect of a model’s input variable on the model’s output value, as well as the relative significance of affecting factors, this paper takes advantage of the relevancy factor, which calculates the degree of each input’s influence on the output. A higher relevancy factor (r) value for an input indicates a more significant influence on output (Hemmati-Sarapardeh et al., 2020 ). This means that the more an input parameter is involved in forecasting an output variable, the more sensitive the output value is to the input factor (Barati-Harooni et al., 2019 ). Fig. 10 a demonstrates the impact of the three input parameters of total field capacity, working gas capacity, and base gas as input parameters on the maximum daily delivery (MDD) in a depleted field as a target parameter. The positive relevancy factors for all three inputs show a positive relationship between the inputs and the target. More specifically, as the base gas, working gas capacity, and total field capacity in a depleted field increase, the maximum daily delivery also climbs. However, as can be observed, the maximum relevancy factor belongs to the total field capacity (0.9). This means that this input parameter has a higher impact on the maximum daily delivery than any other. It is worth mentioning that relatively similar relevancy factor values for base gas (0.87) and working gas capacity (0.85) parameters mean they impose a relatively similar impact on the maximum daily delivery. Fig. 10 b also illustrates the measured relevancy factors between the mentioned inputs and the target in a salt dome. Like what was observed in a depleted field, there is a positive link between total field capacity, working gas capacity, and base gas as well as MDD. Again, this demonstrates that the MDD increases with climbing the base gas, working gas capacity, and total field capacity in a salt dome. However, the working gas capacity imposes a higher impact on the MDD due to its higher relevancy factor (0.64) than other parameters. In Fig. 10 c, the computed relevancy factors between the abovementioned inputs and the target in an aquifer are depicted. Similar to the previous scenarios, there is a positive relationship between the total field capacity, working gas capacity, base gas and MDD. This relationship shows that with increasing the three mentioned input parameters in an aquifer, the MDD also grows. However, the base gas significantly affects the MDD in an aquifer due to its higher relevancy factor value (0.8). Overall, in all three sites of the depleted field, salt dome, and aquifer examined in this paper, there is a positive connection between the base gas, working gas capacity, total field capacity, and MDD. However, it should be noted that the relevancy factor values measured between inputs and target in the salt dome are not as high as in other locations of the depleted field and aquifer. This could be the reason for the weaker performance of the models developed to estimate the target in the salt dome discussed in previous sections.     5 Summary and conclusions In this article, three robust machine learning models, namely LSSVM, GPR, and ET, were developed to accurately predict the deliverability of storing underground natural gas in three types of geological formations, including depleted fields, aquifers, and salt domes. The monthly reservoir storage data records of 387 storage sites in 6 regions in the USA were adopted to investigate the three machine learning models’ predicting ability. From the results, the following vital marks could be drawn: • This study suggested the potential of robust ML models to approximate the deliverability of UNGS in depleted fields, aquifers, and salt domes.  • The GPR model could achieve the most accurate results in estimating the deliverability of three types of storage formations.  • Sensitivity analysis indicated that the total field capacity is the key parameter for predicting the deliverability of depleted fields. According to relevancy factor values, the working gas capacity is the main factor in predicting the deliverability of a salt dome. However, base gas is the key variable for predicting the deliverability of UNGS in aquifer sites.  • The advantage of this study is that it developed the fast and accurate smart GPR model to serve as a template to predict the deliverability of various field storage characterizations with a comprehensive database that can be easily adapted for similar disciplines. The GPR model can be used to estimate the deliverability of storage sites that have similar features in the proposed databank.    Unfortunately, the established prediction smart models have the following drawbacks: • The smart predictive model is only employed for data that has a similar range of datasets.  • The predictive models could only be applied in conventional formations such as depleted fields, salt domes, and saline aquifers.
