                  Renewable energy sources like solar energy have an important role to play towards the implementation of the 2030 agenda and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Africa. While renewable energy was not stated as one of the technologies for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), it played an indirect role towards meeting MDG targets especially in the areas such as household application, health, education and poverty reduction in Africa. However, renewable energy's impacts (including solar energy technologies) were not quantified, and lack of performance assessment could be in part attributed to the weak implementation of solar energy projects in the developing world including countries in Africa. The aim of this paper is to conduct meta-analysis of the literature on the performance of solar energy technologies in order to determine solar energy adoption trends in African countries. This is supplemented with expert interviews and data gathered from the World Bank/Global Environment Facility. Using three case studies of Ghana, Kenya and South Africa, this paper examines the benefits and challenges that are associated with the application of solar energy technologies for meeting SDGs in Africa. Finally, the paper concludes by highlighting the policy implication for the application of solar energy technologies.

While renewable energy was not stated as one of the technologies for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), it played an indirect role towards meeting MDG targets especially in the areas such as household application, health, education and poverty reduction in Africa. However, renewable energy's impacts (including solar energy technologies) were not quantified, and lack of performance assessment could be in part attributed to the weak implementation of solar energy projects in the developing world including countries in Africa. The aim of this paper is to conduct meta-analysis of the literature on the performance of solar energy technologies in order to determine solar energy adoption trends in African countries. This is supplemented with expert interviews and data gathered from the World Bank/Global Environment Facility. Using three case studies of Ghana, Kenya and South Africa, this paper examines the benefits and challenges that are associated with the application of solar energy technologies for meeting SDGs in Africa. Finally, the paper concludes by highlighting the policy implication for the application of solar energy technologies.   Keywords Solar energy technologies  Sustainable development goals  Africa  Policymakers    1 Introduction The majority of the African population (620 million people), especially in the rural area, lack access to electricity and most of the rural population (700 million people) still depend on traditional biomass (AIE, 2014 ). Access to the national power grid in peri-urban and rural areas is very costly, slow and financially unviable (Szabó et al., 2011 ). The rising energy demand in Africa as a result of the growing population represents one of the most significant challenges to sustainable economic growth. In light of increasing energy demand, rising energy prices and the need to reinforce necessary measures against global warming, renewable energy sources remain part of the global solution and have been widely exploited around the world recently (de Vries et al., 2007 ; Fang and Li, 2013 ). Renewable energy is energy produced from renewable resources and can be replaced quickly by a natural process in form of energy generated from sun or wind. It is rapidly emerging as an alternative to conventional fossil fuels around the world including in Africa. Currently, part of the solution to the energy challenges in Africa is to replace fossil fuels and traditional biomass that have serious health and environmental consequences with renewable energy sources. Given an abundance of natural resources in Africa, different types of renewable energy can offer practical and affordable solutions that are beneficial for health, environment and economy. Eastern and Northern Africa have the greatest potential for renewable energy sources such as solar and wind applications, while Central Africa has the least potential (Hermann et al., 2014 ). Moreover, some African countries show great potential for different renewable energy technologies. For example, in terms of potential for the countries in this study, South Africa has the largest with potential for concentrating solar power of 43275 TWh/year, for solar PV of 42243 TWh/year and for wind of 41195 TWh/year. In contrast, Kenya has potential for concentrating solar power of 15399 TWh/year, for solar photovoltaic (PV) of 23046 TWh/year and for wind of 22476 TWh/year. Finally, Ghana has the lowest with concentrating solar power of 229 TWh/year, solar PV of 7644 TW/year and wind of 606 TWh/year (Hermann et al., 2014 ). The most abundant energy resource is solar. As a renewable energy source, solar is clean and provided by nature through sunlight, and the cost of solar power is decreasing rapidly. While most parts of Africa show great potential for solar power, transmission only becomes feasible when the cost of investment decreases more than 50% in order to compensate for the high cost of transmission (Sanoh et al., 2014 ). Solar powers as a form of energy provides an efficient way of generating electricity from solar radiation with low carbon footprint and minimal environmental hazard. Indeed, harnessing the power of sunlight with solar technologies could provide large scale energy storage solutions throughout rural areas (Ramakumar and Hughes, 1981 ). Diversifying national energy mix using solar energy technologies to foster sustainable economic growth and to improve the quality of life especially in rural Africa will depend largely on the implementation of government strategies and policy instruments aimed towards the application of solar energy (Timilsina et al., 2012 ). As of 2017, global solar markets are largely dominated by advanced developing countries like China and India, occupying first and third positions respectively. Next to China, USA occupies the second position, while developed countries like Japan, Germany and UK occupy top 10 positions globally (IEA, 2018 ). According to IEA, China being the largest solar market represents 54% of total installed capacity of solar PV in 2017- the country reached 53 GW, up from 34.4 GW in 2016. As of 2014, Europe remains the largest regional market followed by the Asia Pacific with the Chinese dominated solar market. The global markets especially solar PV are expected to reach $US148.5 billion by 2020, up from $US108.3 billion in 2014 (Market Share Store, 2018 ). Despite rapid growth of the solar market both at the global and regional levels, overwhelming majority of African countries, with the exception of South Africa, lag behind. In 2014, South Africa became the first country in Africa to install almost 1 GW of solar PV, and since then, growth has declined significantly, with 500 MW and 13 MW installed in 2016 and 2017, respectively (IEA, 2018 ). Energy, and especially renewable resources (e.g., solar energy), are crucial to tackling many of the various global challenges of sustainable development including food insecurity, poverty and climate change problems (Word Bank, 2006 ). While renewable energy was not stated as one of the technologies for the achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development (MDGs), it played indirect role towards meeting MDG targets especially in the areas such as household application, health, education and poverty reduction in Africa (UN, 2015 ). However, renewable energy's impacts were not quantified, and lack of performance assessment could be in part attributed to the weak implementation of solar energy projects in developing world including countries in Africa. Despite the implementation of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects (introduced under the Kyoto protocol) toward reducing greenhouse gases emissions, few African countries (namely South Africa, Morocco and Egypt) participated in the project (Goldman, 2010 ; Karakosta and Psarras, 2013 ). Lack of institutional capacity has been attributed to limited participation (Adenle et al., 2017 ). One could argue that renewable energy initiatives including solar energy project did not form part of overall sustainable development strategies under the UN development agenda despite causal relationship between renewable energy resources and the MDGs. Hence, there was lack of motivation on the part of African government to move renewable initiatives forward. Unlike the MDGs, the 2030 agenda such as Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) devoted one of its 17 goals to energy; SDG 7‘‘Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all’’ thereby creating a vital role for energy sector toward achieving SDGs. In this paper, the implications of developing appropriate renewable energy policy are explored for the implementation of solar energy programs in African countries like Ghana, Kenya and South Africa particularly with regards to addressing complex development challenges. The challenges faced by South Africa, Kenya and Ghana to improve their solar production are not the same, but this study argues that government investment can be crucial in all cases. In Ghana and Kenya, limited investment (e.g., research and development, R&D), government inability to attract private investment, regulatory uncertainty and problems of governance continue to affect uptake of solar energy. The relatively advanced renewable R&D program and specific policies gives South Africa an edge over Ghana and Kenya due to high installation of solar PV in the former. The aim of this paper is to conduct meta-analysis of the literature on the performance of solar energy technologies and highlight its potential role towards contributing to the achievement of SDG targets. The paper examines some donor-funded solar energy projects by the World Bank/Global Environment Facility and how promotion of solar energy especially solar home system (SHS) and solar water heating (SWH) projects can address sustainable development challenges. Using three case studies of Ghana, Kenya and South Africa, this paper examines the benefits and challenges that are associated with the application of solar energy technologies for meeting SDGs in Africa. Finally, supportive environment for the implementation of solar energy projects are discussed with the specific emphasis on an integrated policy approach to facilitate the application of solar energy technologies in the continent. In the following section, methodology for the collection of data is outlined.  2 Methodology This research paper focuses on empirical studies that investigate the outcome of impact of solar energy technologies in tackling sustainable development challenges in Africa. This paper uses different kinds of sources such as Google scholar, Web of Science, Science Direct and Donors' Database (e.g., the World Bank/Global Environment Facility-GEF) to identify relevant information that has been published in peer-reviewed literature and policy documents. The review is supplemented with experts’ interviews on the application of low-carbon technologies (e.g., solar energy) either as part of adaptation or mitigation measures required to tackle climate change in Africa. The following three steps used to obtain the important information for this study are described below; 2.1 Selection and review of evidenced-based literature The empirical studies on the benefits and potential impacts of solar energy technologies form part of the basis for the analysis. Emphasis was focused on studies examining the results of solar energy projects that have been completed or at the initial phase of the implementation. Similar studies related to the adoption of solar energy technologies also form part of the analysis. The analysis was conducted through peer-reviewed literature published on household surveys and stakeholder interviews regarding the adoption of solar energy technologies including solar home system (e.g., solar PV), solar lantern, solar heating water and solar chargers. The grounded theory approach was used to examine the characteristics of adoption or application of solar energy technologies in the published studies (Glaser and Strauss, 1967 ). This approach has been described as ‘‘way of sifting, sorting, and synthesizing data” (Charmaz, 2006 ), (p. 71). The relationship and patterns across various categories within the dataset were identified through a grounded theory approach. Studies examining the observations related to technical, physical and practical components that influence the adoption of solar energy technologies at the household and provincial levels in African countries (e.g., Ghana, Kenya and South Africa) were selected. Specifically, environmental, economic and social benefits of solar energy as well as challenges and barriers affecting their benefits were analysed. Important keywords such as ‘‘solar energy and Ghana’‘, ‘‘solar energy and Kenya’’ or ‘‘solar energy and South Africa’’ were used through the sources mentioned above to identify relevant articles on this topic between 1990 and 2018 (up to August). All searches resulted to 846 titles and abstracts. Based on regional scope and topic of the studies, abstracts were further reviewed to select targeted studies. For example, author aimed at some of the studies that comprised interviews with various stakeholder groups including the consumers, government officials and representatives of development organisations. The results were refined with the focus on solar energy technologies published in social science research domain and the sample was reduced to 27 papers for the in-depth analysis (Table 1  ). Further analysis generated the first set of codes used to identify factors influencing the adoption of solar energy technologies. After reviewing the available studies in detail, authors looked for factors that are associated with socio-economic and environmental benefits within the contexts of the application of solar powered products and their perceptions based on associated benefits. Relevant observations were aggregated and grouped based on the influential factor derived from the selected literature. The overarching themes identified in the second aggregated coding led to the following five benefits categories: 1) Electricity; 2) Heating; 3) Education and health; 4) Employment; and 5) Climate change. Following this, another set of codes were generated and grouped based on its relevance to barriers and challenges that are associated with the adoption of solar energy technologies. Their perceptions of barriers associated with the implementation process, market development and adoption of solar powered products as revealed in the selected studies were highlighted. Finally the themes identified in the second aggregated coding led to the following barriers categories:1) Weak government policy; 2) Financial constraints; 3) Technical problem; 4) Cultural problem; and 5) Lack of awareness. In the categorization process, using Hyper RESEARCH coding, we counted both positive and negative instances for the application of solar energy technologies in the selected countries. First, we focused on positive instances where each category was mentioned as benefits for the adoption of solar energy technologies. Second, we focused on the negative instances where each category was mentioned as a barrier or hindrance to the implementation and adoption of solar energy technologies. The number of negative or positive instances that applied to each category through the coding system was counted in order to generate a frequency count for the both five categories (benefits & barriers). The same process was repeated for all the three countries (Ghana, Kenya and South Africa). All relevant codes were assigned to every instance (at least one code for each identified theme either in benefit or barrier category). For example, in Ghana, a total of 620 benefits and 586 barriers mentioned.  2.2 Analysis of GEF data 21 solar projects financed by the GEF during 1992–2017 in 21 African countries were reviewed. GEF data were chosen on solar projects because of its dominant role in financing decentralised renewable energy projects in Africa. GEF as a financial mechanism has funded thousands of projects including renewable energy worth over $17 billion more than any institution in the developing world and continues to mobilise billions of dollars for several other projects around the world (Yang, 2017 ). Among other donors, GEF renewable energy projects have been proven to be successful in many developing countries especially in terms of standards, certification and testing that developed to support the introduction of renewable energy technologies. Solar energy project activities in the GEF data are described as country or region specific projects. Projects implemented within the individual country are regarded as country specific projects, whereas projects implemented in one or two more countries are regarded as region-specific projects. For example, as observed in GEF data, dissemination network for household solar PV in Ethiopia and Kenya was classified as region specific project. For each country, the number of solar energy projects implemented and total GEF financing were recorded during 1992–2017. And regional projects counted in all countries where the projects were implemented.  2.3 Expert interviews A semi-structured interview allows us to capture a wide range of perspectives on the concerns and personal experience of the respondents (Britten, 1995 ). A total of fifteen interviews with the experts (Table 2  ) focusing on renewable energy were conducted through the Skype or face-to-face interview during the two conferences on climate change and development in Africa (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 21–23 October 2013; Marrakesh, Morocco 8–10 October 2014). Some of the experts targeted have either been involved in renewable energy research or in the implementation of renewable energy projects in Africa. While other renewable energy sources including wind, and geothermal were mentioned, we limited our focus exclusively to solar energy technologies for the purpose of this study. Interviews were conducted in English and lasted between 30 and 60 min. Each interview was digitally recorded, transcribed and coded. Using HyperRESEARCH software for coding, emerging patterns in terms of benefits and challenges especially as they relate to the application of solar energy technologies were identified.   3 Analysis and results 3.1 Assessment of solar energy projects The review of published survey studies revealed that the majority of implementation of solar power projects in Africa is carried out by donors including the multilateral development organisations, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), financial institutions and developed countries (Amankwah-Amoah and Sarpong, 2016 ; Bawakyillenuo, 2012 ; Goldman, 2010 ; Wlokas, 2011 ). Over the past twenty years, the implementation of solar energy projects has taken place across African countries with one of the well known international donors support such as the Global Environment Facility (GEF). Fig. 1  a presents the number of GEF solar energy projects in African countries between 1992 and 2017 (see https://www.thegef.org/projects ). Out of 38 solar energy projects, South Africa has six projects which is the largest, followed by Morocco (4 projects), Egypt (3 projects) and Namibia (3 projects), while several countries have between one and two projects. Fig. 1  b shows the share of solar projects based on the regions (see https://www.thegef.org/projects ). The same figure shows that East Africa represents the largest share of solar energy projects accounting for 34%, followed by Southern Africa (28%) and North Africa (26%), while the West and the Central Africa represent 8% and 3%, respectively. In total, approximately $180 million was allocated by GEF to 38 projects analysed (Fig. 1  c) (see https://www.thegef.org/projects ). The North Africa region has the highest of GEF financing ($120.47 million) allocated to solar projects, followed by the East Africa region ($24.45 million) and the Southern Africa region ($22.31 million), the West African region ($9.28 million) and the Central African region ($1.73 million). The regional has the smallest amount of GEF financing ($720,000) allocated to solar projects. The difference between the number of solar energy projects and the amount of GEF financing allocated to the North Africa in comparison to the rest of the regions can be explained by the fact that solar project implementations were dominated by countries such as Egypt and Morocco. For example, $61 million and $51 GEF financing were allocated to solar projects in Egypt and Morocco, respectively. This is corroborated by Adenle et al. (2017)  who argued that finance and strong institutional capacity can play an important role in the implementation of solar energy projects. The next section examines the socio-economic and environmental benefits of solar energy technologies.  3.2 Assessment of socio-economic and environmental benefits of solar energy technologies and potential impact for the implementation of SDGs In this section, the reported or potential impacts of solar energy technologies are described and cover many of the priorities and aspirations for the SDGs in the implementation of the 2030 agenda. In this study, it is important to note that the assessments of solar powered products were not directly measured for achieving the SDG targets. However, evidence gathered for this study suggests that solar powered products can address sustainable development challenges including the SDGs. In light of recorded socio-economic and environmental benefits, solar innovation can be harnessed for the implementation of SDGs in Africa as described in Table 3  . 3.2.1 Social benefits The solar energy technologies address social dimension that can impact several category groups of SDGs including end poverty (SDG1), zero hunger (SDG2), health (SDG3), education (SDG4) sanitation (SDG6) and clean energy (SDG7). The interaction among these SDGs, for example, SDG7 linked to SDG1, SDG2, SDG3, SDG4 and SDG6 can address poverty and hunger problems, improve health and well-being, and enhance skill development and education. This section highlights cross-cutting issues and potential roles of solar energy technologies in reaching the interlinked SDG targets. 3.2.1.1 Provision of electric light and powering household appliances Electricity is important in meeting the demands of household energy in Ghana, Kenya and South Africa, however, a large proportion of the population still lacks access to regular power supply. The data reviewed for this study indicates that many poor households in South Africa are not connected to the national grid. The inability of households to access electricity is due to a very costly electricity grid infrastructure, lack of smart grid and unreliable grid extension. Hence, the need for clean and cheap alternative energy sources to meet the demand of growing population. Fig. 2(a and b, & c)   demonstrates the percentage of benefits based on the perceptions of the respondents reviewed in the selected papers that fall into each of five categories described above (see Section 2.1 ). In Fig. 2 a and c, electricity was perceived as most important benefit to the application of solar energy in Kenya and Ghana respectively, while in Fig. 2  b, heating was perceived as the most important benefit to the application of solar energy in South Africa. It is obvious that the demand for electricity in Ghana and Kenya (mostly among rural and urban poor) is higher than South Africa. The provision of energy services for cooking or heating, for example, varies from village to village and even from urban area to urban area in Ghana, Kenya and South Africa. The peer-reviewed survey shows that 8.20% of Ghana households and 5.24% of Kenyan households require heating compared to 46.10% of South African households (Fig. 2  a, b &c). The fact that Ghana and Kenya have smaller heating percentage does not mean the demand for heating is very low in both countries. As observed in the reviewed studies for the three countries, factors influencing the electricity grid or solar electricity use for heating depend on seasonality, location, income and population density. For example, in South Africa, the Zanemvula Solar Water Heating (SWH) project located in urban setting like Port Elizabeth will be different in terms of electricity consumption compared to Northern region of Ghana or the county of Nakuru in Kenya where access to electricity is dependent on household incomes (Roche and Blanchard, 2018 ; Wlokas, 2011 ). The reviewed surveys emphasise the significance of hot water heating as it relates to energy consumption within the average household, especially in South Africa, where water heating accounts for more than half of energy consumption (Kakaza and Folly, 2015 ). In view of the growing challenge, solar energy technology such as solar home system (SHS) (made up of various components including solar panel, storage battery, inverter and charger controller) provides household services and their needs in the three countries (Acker and Kammen, 1996 ; Azimoh et al., 2015 ; Ulsrud et al., 2015 ). According to these studies, solar powered products (e.g., solar PV) play a significant role in delivering lighting and powering radio, television, mobile phones and other household appliances in rural homes. For example, in the Upper East Region of Ghana, government solar energy project with an installed capacity of 2 MW grid-connected solar power serve various household purposes including heating, cooking and lighting (VRA, 2013 ). In Kenya, the Ikisiya Energy Centre located in a village of 383 households has a capacity of 2.16 kW (kW) solar PV system where services including lantern renting and phone charging were provided only to people who could afford it (Ulsrud et al., 2015 ). According to (Jacobson, 2007 ), solar PV was only available among households that could afford the solar electricity. Similarly, in South Africa (Vhembe municipality), 50% of the households interviewed reported that their energy needs were met by SHS electricity, for those who could afford it (Azimoh et al., 2015 ). Moreover, it was also reported that solar powered irrigation plays an important role in improving crop yields in rural Ghana and Kenya. For example, in Western Kenya, smallholders have benefitted from the adoption of solar powered irrigation pump to tackle challenges of frequent drought and unreliable rainfall (Schützeichel, 2017 ). However, access to solar energy technologies remains very limited in many poor households despite positive impacts. In summary, using solar energy technologies to access mobile phone, radio and TV can provide vital information and enhance the delivery of better agriculture extension services as well as improved agricultural productivity for the rural communities, thereby contributing to the achievement of SDG1 and SDG2 (Azimoh et al., 2015 ; Ulsrud et al., 2015 ) (Schützeichel, 2017 ).  3.2.1.2 Time and energy savings enhance access to quality education and better health services The adoption of solar energy technology does not only show that households benefit from solar energy services but also encourages time and energy savings. In Ghana, study indicates that the availability of solar PV in several low-income households in Pungu (the Upper East Region) contributed to time and energy savings especially among most vulnerable group (women and female children) that spent significant amount of time on firewood collection (Banuenumah et al., 2016 ). This study recorded the highest acceptance among the interviewed respondents (96%) in terms of the contribution of solar PV to reduction of household cores. This finding suggests the important role of solar PV in reducing the burdens women and girls face in collecting the firewood. Another study by Biermann et al. (1999), analysed fuel savings from the field test of different types of solar cookers in South Africa and showed that overall fuel savings from all fuel types (paraffin/kerosene, gas and wood) are 38%. According to these authors, kerosene, gas and wood represent 2000 L, 2 tons and 60 tons in term of fuel savings, respectively (Biermann et al., 1999 ). They argued that these fuel savings are considerable given that all fuel types were being used (in addition to the use of solar cooker), which were costly, and time consuming. The availability of solar energy saved women's time as they had to travel between 3k and 10 km to collect firewood prior to use of solar energy (Masekoameng et al., 2005 ; Wlokas, 2011 ). This is corroborated by a similar study conducted in South Africa by (Curry et al., 2017 ) who reported that the use of SWH (63 out of 67 households) resulted to saving of an average 67% of the electricity compared to traditional electric water heater by individual household. Another study indicates that installation of SWH in Guateng reduced the peak electricity demand by 70% at the household level (Ozdemir et al., 2012 ). In Nakura, Meru and Bungoma part of Kenya, respondents interviewed mentioned that the use of solar PV made life much easier among the household members especially for women and children as solar energy saved them time and the hassle of travelling long distance every week to buy kerosene (Acker and Kammen, 1996 ). The improved access to quality education and better health services played an important role in adoption process of SHS in Ghana, Kenya and South Africa, as adoption of solar energy technology contributed to time savings. There has been impact of access to light among school children and at the health centres through the use of solar PV in the rural areas. Evidence through the selection of surveys examined for this study shows that rural communities where access to solar electricity has been provided resulted to positive impact on educations as well as improved health outcomes. In the reviewed studies, authors argued that students have been able to stay longer in the night to do their homework, and moreover the availability of SHS has contributed to improved physical health and well-being of many households that participated in the solar programs (Banuenumah et al., 2016 ) (Wlokas, 2011 ) (Jacobson, 2007 ). In Ghana, Banuenumah et al. (2016)  analysed social impacts (education & health) of SHS in Pungu rural community and showed that the adoption of solar PV contributed to better delivery of education and health services. On the education side, their observation suggests extension of study hours among the school children and government ability to retain teachers due to availability of electricity, and on the health side, solar PV system encourages vaccine refrigeration and clinic lighting for better treatment of patients in a time-saving manner. A similar survey indicates that the introduction of solar purified water in Bongo district of the Upper Region significantly reduced the incidence of fluorosis by 96.3%- the incidence rate is down to 0.76 mg/l from 20.65 mg/l, conforming to WHO acceptable standard of 0–1.5 mg/l (Antwi et al., 2011 ). In rural Kenya, relatively little solar energy can be available for students’ education due to other domestic purposes (e.g. television viewing) (Jacobson, 2007 ). For example, this author argued that, of almost 80% of solar households with school age children (n = 76), solar lighting was used for studying in only 40% solar households. Although, the quality of light from solar lantern is much higher and better than that of light from kerosene lamp or candle despite education benefits not being universal among solar homes (Jacobson, 2007 ). Further to education, social institution such as health centre in rural area has benefitted from government installation of solar PV in Kenya (Duke et al., 2002 ), thereby encouraging timely evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of patients. Azimoh et al. (2015)  examined the impact of SHS electricity on children education in four different solar households (Polokwane n = 23; Vhember Center n = 24; Tubatse n = 23 and Umkhanyakude n = 18) in South Africa. Their result showed that almost 90% of the respondents interviewed from these households mentioned that SHS electricity had positive impact on their child's education. According to these authors, the availability of SHS electricity not only had positive impact in terms of extending study hours but also contributed to better performance of their children at schools. This is consistent with other study reported on better performance of school children that used SHS electricity in rural Zambia (Gustavsson, 2007 ). The study reported by Wlokas (2011)  showed that there are linkages between well-being of households and solar water heater interventions. For example, according to this author, the availability of warm water (due to adoption of SWH) helped improve the health of infants and children, thereby making children school’ attendance more regular. In fact, this also contributed to improving mental health of the families, particularly women, by reducing depression caused by the burden of wood collection and processing (Wlokas, 2011 ). To summarise this section, energy efficiency, through the adoption of solar energy, can play an important role in achieving some of the SDG targets that are related to sustainable consumption and production (SDG12), sustainable use and conservation of natural resources (SDG15) and peace (SDG16). For example, biodiversity can be conserved by preventing the extinction of threatened species (target 15.5) due to strong link between access to energy efficiency and reduced firewood collection (Zubi et al., 2019 ). Likewise, time savings can reduce different forms of violence and death (target 16.1) among women and children who are more likely to experience violence related to rape and other sexual assaults (Acker and Kammen, 1996 ; Banuenumah et al., 2016 ; Oparaocha and Dutta, 2011 ). In context of education (SDG4) and health (SDG3), energy efficiency is strongly linked to quality education and improved health services (Banuenumah et al., 2016 ). In this regard there are strong links to target 4.2 (all boys and girls have access to quality early childhood development and pre-primary and primary educations) and target 3.1 (reduce global maternal mortality ratio). In spite of the linkages, the question of whether different types of solar energy technologies aiming at delivering these targets can be adequately accessed in Africa including those three countries described above is unclear, and therefore makes the implementation of renewable energy policy necessary.   3.2.2 Economic benefits SDG1, SDG 2 and SDG 8 are part of the category groups that are described for the strong links between economic dimension and solar energy technologies. 3.2.2.1 Creation of employment opportunities and income earnings Evidence suggests that the development and implementation of solar energy projects continues to create jobs and empower people economically both in the rural and urban areas. Part of the benefits documented through the adoption of SHS in Ghana includes income generation among farmers (Steel et al., 2016 ). These authors showed that the farmers' ability to extend lighting after dark created more hours for farming, thereby enhancing income-generating activities. The same authors also showed that 27% solar lanterns adopters and 10% SHS adopters, reported income earnings for trading and phone charging, respectively. Moreover, the surveys analysed indicate that there was demand for local labour for installation, operation and maintenance of solar energy technologies. For example, the Kenyan Energy Center staffs were recruited from the same location to deliver services including solar lantern renting, maintenance and batteries replacement (Ulsrud et al., 2015 ). In fact, the energy center encourages the employment of women, according to a respondent interviewed in one of the survey; ‘‘Because of the lanterns which benefited us so much, and also when you opened the Energy Centre people got jobs because our girls are employed there, and they are good role models like [the woman manager]’’  (Winther et al., 2018 ), p 68. The rapid expansion of SWH market in South Africa has led to job creation-the recent survey evidence is in agreement on the job creation (Eskom, 2013 ) (Curry et al., 2017 ). Over 42 companies were registered as SWH suppliers and manufacturers between 2007 and 2009 (Donev et al., 2012 ). According to these authors, the solar water industry is expected to increase by 40% through creating employment opportunities in the country. This is consistent with Eskom’ findings that the SWH market grew to 400 suppliers in 2011 from 20 suppliers in 1997 (Eskom, 2013 ). The survey analysed by Curry et al. (2017)  looks into SWH as source of employment in four townships (Mabopane View, Ga-Rankuwa View, Nelmapius and Soshanguve) where nearly 6000 SWHs were installed as of July 2011. Their results showed that 45 people made up of five different teams were trained and employed from these townships. These authors estimated that if the installation of 60,000 SWHs went ahead as planned, nearly 400 local jobs would have been created by 2015 in Tshwane alone. Although, temporary employment of the installers would mean loss of skills and training after they have left the job which is currently prevalent in the implementation of SWH projects (Wlokas, 2011 ). In view of this concern, the SWH deployment may generate short-term economic benefits without sustaining employee training programs. Similarly, in the leading African countries like Morocco and Egypt, the application of solar energy technologies has shown great potential for job creation in heating and cooling sector. For example, in Morocco, solar water heating program is estimated to create 13,000 new jobs by the year 2020 (MENA, 2013 ), while concentrating solar power is forecasted to create 300,000 new jobs during the next 30 years (de Arce et al., 2012 ). In Egypt, the installation of concentrating solar power (2.6 MW), solar PV arrays (500 MW) and solar water heating (1.2 million m2 ) by 2022 is expected to generate hundreds of thousands of new jobs (Patlitzianas, 2011 ). In summary, the adoption of solar energy can be crucial in achieving the need for quality employment and sustainable economic growth is highlighted in SDG8 (Steel et al., 2016 ; Winther et al., 2018 ). In this context, there are strong links between the adoption of solar energy and decent job creation (target 8.3), but with limited understanding about how former can help achieve SDG 8.3 target. Yet, evidence suggests limited contributions of renewable energy technologies including solar energy to gross domestic product (GDP) in Africa due to various obstacles (see Section 4 ) affecting large scale dissemination of solar energy (Pegels, 2010 ; Sanoh et al., 2014 ). According to Pegels (2010) , solar energy represents less than 2% of electricity production in South Africa, compared to 86% of electricity production from coal, despite the country being the Africa's largest solar market. The cost of producing electricity from coal is estimated at EUR 0.03 per kWh compared to levelized cost of producing electricity from CSP technology at EUR 0.13 per kWh (Pegels, 2010 ). This explains why solar energy technology cannot currently compete with the coal as the top source of generating electricity in the country. It is important to point out that the application of solar energy technologies offer different groups with different needs. This is reflected in the fact that SWH system is commercialized and used domestically in South Africa and is more frequently used in this country than Ghana and Kenya, where SHS system is mostly used in the rural areas. Thus, target markets can vary from country to country.  3.2.2.2 Monetary savings The uptake of solar energy technology not only reduces energy usage but also saves money among the adopters across the three countries. A study by (Obeng and Evers, 2010 ) analysed two types of sources of energy (solar electrified and non-electrified enterprises) to meet daily electricity needs across five different regions in Ghana. The results of the surveyed enterprises showed that an average of US$3.34 (¢30,700 before redenomination of Ghanaian Cedi) was saved monthly on kerosene consumption by the enterprise using solar PV. In view of benefits of solar PV, the monthly savings on battery, candles, dry cell and kerosene consumption can be reinvested for other household purposes (e.g., foods and medications), thereby improving the quality of life. Similarly, in a study conducted by Acker and Kammen (1996)  and Winter et al. (2018) , solar PV was the most popular choice among the respondents interviewed in Kenya as they mentioned that solar PV products were the least expensive and saved money when compared to grid extension or other alternative energy source like diesel generator. According to Winther et al. (2018) , this has been made possible by the financial support offered by the Nordic Development Fund and through incremental financial services that were provided by the innovative companies in the country. Through these services, a daily payment equivalent to rural household expenditure on phone charging and kerosene was set up (using mobile platform such as M-PESA) to allow consumers access solar PV (Winter et al., 2018 ). Because of this, they spent less on electricity bills and kerosene and saved enough money to spend on other household items. This is also consistent with the expert's viewpoint, “they can move from spending a month's salary a year on a paraffin lamp to spending a few months salary over a lifetime for a solar lamp.” In more recent consumer surveys conducted by the United Nations Development Programme, this organisation wanted to find out why people would like to purchase solar PV products in Kenya (UNDP, 2017 ). Their study showed that 58% of those surveyed mentioned cost savings as one specific attribute that attracted them to solar PV products. In fact, this study concluded that cost saving is one of the biggest factors that encouraged the adoption of solar PV among the users. An analysis of low-income household expenditure savings on energy (Tshwane, South Africa) was provided by Curry et al. (2017) . According to this finding, more than 50% households equipped with SWH have been calculated to save 62  kW h/month (R54/month) on electricity bill compared to 92 kwh/month used by the conventional electric water heater. This shows that SWH system lowered the cost of electricity in the surveyed households. Although these authors drew attention to the fact that some of the households interviewed experienced higher water bills from the usage of SWH due to water leakage which was beyond their control. They concluded that water leakage has been solely responsible for the increased bills. But those households who experienced savings used the extra money to buy food for their children. Lowest annual expenditure and monetary savings with payback periods of 3–4 years were experienced among the middle-income households using SWH system in Guateng (Ozdemir et al., 2012 ). In addition to job creation, there are strong links between the adoptions of solar energy and income and monetary savings. The strong relationship between hunger and income suggests the important role of solar energy through monetary savings, because the large parts of total income in many African countries are spent on foods acquisition (Kennedy and Peters, 1992 ). These effects can potentially and directly contribute to achievement SDG1 and SDG2 targets.   3.2.3 Environmental benefits Access to clean energy (SDG7) is directly linked to SDG 3 and SDG13 and thus provides both health and environmental benefits to Ghana, Kenya and South Africa. 3.2.3.1 Reduced indoor air pollution The use of wood, charcoal and kerosene dominate energy sector in the rural areas in Ghana, Kenya and South Africa. Because of this, there has been significant increase in the number of diseases (e.g., heart disease and lung cancer) largely attributed to household air pollution due to inefficient cooking and heating practices associated with the use of wood and kerosene in many African countries (Barnes et al., 2009 ; WHO, 2016 ). In view of the growing problem, the interviewed experts mentioned that the application of solar energy technology is particularly important in the rural areas where primary lighting source is kerosene, which is very expensive, polluting, and dangerous, and that the adoption of solar energy will reduce the indoor air pollution. While there is a very limited research available, anecdotal evidence suggests important environment benefits of solar energy. A study conducted by (Obeng et al., 2008 ) examined different types of energy sources between solar-electrified households and non-electrified households in rural Ghana. Their results showed that 89% households that used a combination of kerosene, dry cell and batteries were affected by indoor smoke, while only 7% households that used solar PV alone were not affected by indoor smoke, suggesting that kerosene lantern and stove replacement with the solar PV can reduce adverse effects of indoor air smoke. Moreover, according to Acker and Kammmen (1996) , solar PV products offer environmental benefits in terms of decreased use of wood and kerosene in Kenya, thereby providing air quality benefits. Reduced air pollution from firewood use is one of reported positive effects of adopting solar cooker in South Africa (Beirmann et al., 1999 ). In light of the benefits highlighted above, the adoption of solar PV can limit the number of illnesses and deaths associated with the indoor pollution through the use of firewood (Beirmann et al., 1999 ), thereby contributing to the achievement of target 3.9 of the SDG 3.  3.2.3.2 Reduced CO2 emission In addition to reduced indoor air pollution, the adoption of solar energy has been linked to reduced emissions at the household levels in the three countries. A review of survey data suggests that the use of solar energy technology in reducing carbon emission is higher in South Africa than Ghana and Kenya (Fig. 2 a, b & c). Despite this, the reviewed studies and expert interviews indicate an urgent need to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions in the rest of the two countries, by promoting low-carbon technologies including solar energy to address the problem at the local level. The application of solar powered system has been found to reduce CO2  emissions associated with kerosene lanterns in majority of rural communities in Ghana. For example, recent findings showed that the use of solar powered system such as LED and CFL lanterns saved emissions between 80.15 and 256.49 kg CO2 /year when compared to 60.99 kg CO2 /year from kerosene lantern (Sekyere et al., 2012 ). Local promotion of solar energy technologies in Kenya, for example, solar lanterns and solar PV lighting can help reduce carbon emissions from kerosene and firewood use (UNDP, 2017 ). The result of interviewed respondents in low-income households in South Africa shows that the installation of SWH system is associated with the benefits such as the reduction of carbon emissions. For example, according to Curry et al. (2017) , 10,330 installed SWH system implemented at the household level saves 610,500 kg of CO2  per month. The same authors argued that CO2  emission savings of 0.96–1.20% could be achieved across the country if targeted households were installed with the SWH. A further analysis of potential positive impacts of installed SWH system in different types of households and commercial heating water sector in South Africa revealed that greenhouse gas emissions were significantly reduced (Donev et al., 2012 ). These authors estimated that 186.4 Mt CO2  and 297.7 Mt CO2  emissions were reduced for moderate and accelerated SWH scenarios, respectively, in South Africa, compared to current 434 Mt CO2  emissions in the country. Taken together, promoting the application of solar energy technologies can reduce dependency on fossil fuels and helps mitigate climate change by lowering carbon emissions, thereby contributing to the achievement of SDG 13 targets. The inter-linkages between SDG7 and SDG13 can have positive impacts on SDG1, 2, 3, 6 and 8 (Luis, 2018 ).     4 Challenges to the application of solar energy technology for meeting SDGs A detailed review of survey-based research articles provides insight into current challenges associated with the implementation of solar energy projects in Ghana, Kenya and South Africa. The majority of the African countries face challenges similar to these three countries particularly in implementing solar energy projects. Fig. 3(a and b & c)  demonstrates the percentage of barriers as explained by the respondents that fall into each of five categories described above. The respondents interviewed in the selected studies perceived financial constraints as the major barriers to the implementation of solar energy projects, followed by technical problems and weak government policy in the three countries. Other militating factors such as cultural problem and lack of awareness also constrain the adoption of solar energy. Financial constraint being the biggest economic barrier has to do more with the high capital, investment, installation and operating costs of solar technologies especially solar PV products. As noted in the review of many of these studies, inherent cost recovery problem, rising counterfeits and pirated products, inability to afford payment and inadequate access to credits among others represent a significant challenge to the widespread use of solar energy in Ghana, Kenya and South Africa and the rest of African countries (Donev et al., 2012 ; Duke et al., 2002 ; Roche and Blanchard, 2018 ; Word Bank, 2010 ). Lack of government investment and loosely coordinated projects by the donors as well as the limited participation of private sector has been a huge challenge facing the implementation of solar PV in rural Ghana (Amankwah-Amoah and Sarpong, 2016 ; Boamah and Rothfu, 2018 ). These wide-ranging problems are not peculiar to Ghana, Kenya and South Africa as other African countries have experienced similar problems. It has been argued that weak financing schemes introduced by the donors, (including development organisations), and lack of government subsidies undermined the sales of SHS, leading to slow uptake of solar PV products especially in rural Kenya (Duke et al., 2002 ). This problem has been attributed to high transaction costs involved in managing a large network of small-scale installation and arranging micro-credits with a highly dispersed customer base in the country. Many low-income households will prefer to use other sources of energy such as kerosene and firewood due to their inability to afford and maintain solar PV products. For example, the cost of solar PV for the size of 40W is $US210 compared to $US 5 kerosene stove (Karekezi and Kithyoma, 2002 ). In rural Ghana, the average monthly maintenance cost for solar PV system is between $US 2.4 and $US2.8 compared to $USS0.5 for kerosene lantern (Obeng et al., 2008 ). And given that many rural Ghanaians living under less than $US1, it will be very difficult to have access to solar powered products. Similarly, limited installation of SWH in areas of most need in South Africa is due to high initial cost of SWH. For example, the average price of installed SWH per square meter is 4191 rand ($US313), which is not affordable for the majority of low income households in the country (Donev et al., 2012 ). According to a World Bank report, lack of financing options remains a huge barrier to market penetration and growth of solar energy technologies in Africa (World Bank, 2010 ). In Kenya and Ghana, despite efforts to assist rural households, financial support, incentive programs and regulatory provision to make solar PV more accessible is very limited. While the affordability of solar PV is common among rural middle class population partly due to mobile platform system and monitoring solution, solar PV plays limited role to support incoming generating activities among rural low-income families (Jacobson, 2007 ; Pedersen and Nygaard, 2018 ). According to Pedersen and Nygaard (2018) , entrepreneurship driven programs and start-up firms have contributed a great deal to solar industry especially solar PV mini-grid market in rural Kenya, thereby challenging the conventional way of providing rural electrification. However, judging from general trends in Africa (in terms of solar energy adoption) and given high level of risks associated with rural solar markets, the long-term sustainability of business model by private sector mini-grid especially in the context of access to finance, access to subsidies and regulatory framework, remains uncertain, without strong partnerships with the national governments. Fig. 3  a, b & c  indicate that technical problem is one of the main factors affecting the uptake of solar energy technologies in African countries including Ghana, Kenya and South Africa. Other challenges associated with the technical problem include limited knowledge and skills, poor installation and maintenance, and unreliable and low-quality components. According to the studies focusing on Ghana and Kenyan solar energy development, absence of solar research institute to support the manufacturing of the components (e.g., research and development programs), lack of education and training centre and limited technical expertise are part of biggest limiting factors to PV industry in both countries (Acker and Kammen, 1996 ; Amankwah-Amoah and Sarpong, 2016 ; Roche and Blanchard, 2018 ; Simiyu et al., 2014 ). Acker and Kammen (1996)  point to the fact that many PV dealers don't have the level of technical expertise required to provide unbiased evaluation of solar PV products that will meet customer's energy needs. They argued that lack of standardised guarantee for the performance of solar system for a given period of time have led to abandoned products and have contributed to PV market uncertainty. Obeng and Evers (2010)  also point to the existence of frequent faulty components of solar PV in rural Ghana due to lack of service technicians and long wait times for repairs. According to these authors, the interviewed respondents stated that this particular problem often discourages end users to continue use solar PV as their enterprise needs reliable source of energy. In South Africa, technical training for large-scale installation and maintenance of SWH is also very limited, not well guided and uncoordinated (Donev et al., 2012 ). A study by Curry et al. (2017)  assessed the large-scale installation of SWHs in the city of Tshwane and found that both householders and company in charge neglected the maintenance of installation of SWH between 1 and 2 years old. In fact, 57% of respondents interviewed attributed the abandonment of SWH to water leakages. Further to this, according to Donev et al. (2012) , lack of standard for testing of solar collectors negatively affected performance measure and quality control of SWH products among local manufacturers. African government renewable energy policies, especially those targeting the promotion of solar energy, appear very weak and fragmented (Word Bank, 2010 ). Their actions and policies continue to undermine solar energy markets and diffusion of solar energy technologies across the continent. Ghana, Kenya and South Africa are good examples where solar market continues to be affected by the weak government policies. The results of the reviewed studies indicate that policy intervention by the Ghanaian and Kenyan governments for solar market penetration in the country is almost absent. In fact, some authors point out that lack of specific policies and regulations continue to have serious impact on solar PV market (Ulsrud et al., 2015 ) (Amankwah-Amoah and Sarpong, 2016 ), thereby affecting the implementation of solar projects across the countries. Based on the reviewed studies, the relative success of solar market reported in the two countries has been attributed to donor support, private sector start-ups, and the fact that rural middle-class can afford the operating cost. These three factors are independent of government policy support. Though, minimal participation of the country government for the application of solar energy technologies was observed in these countries. Despite relative government support, policy uncertainty remains one of the most important barriers to move solar PV technology forward in the two countries. And when taking all of these factors into account, it is obvious that lack of robust policy instrument and lack of government support have been responsible for the slow growth of solar industry in Africa, thereby reducing its potential for tackling sustainable development challenges including achieving SDG targets. However, renewable energy policy initiatives introduced in some African countries including Ghana and Kenya are commendable. For example, in 2008, Feed-in-Tariff policy introduced in Kenya has accelerated the pace of investment in solar industry over the past decade (Nduta, 2019 ). Also, the Ghanaian government introduced free rooftop solar PV system in 2016 as part of subsidy scheme to facilitate the adoption of solar energy for domestic consumption and to reduce dependence on national power grid (Ghanaweb, 2016 ). Despite these policy initiatives, both country governments need to increase policy support in order to experience significant growth of solar industry as well as contributes to sustainable economic growth. Although, South Africa's renewable energy policy may be different from Ghana and Kenya in terms of the modest technological advances in solar industry, the negative effect of policy fluctuation between the national government and local municipalities in introducing SHS in low-income households remains a barrier in the former. For example, in South Africa, lack of cooperation among municipalities on solar energy subsidies in low-income groups suggests that the weakness in national government policy could be an obstacle to the introduction of solar energy technologies in most vulnerable communities (Lemaire, 2011 ). According to Lemaire (2011) , companies relying on subsidies kept the prices low while withdrawal and reinstatement of subsidies disrupted the market, thereby forcing out a lot of companies. This is corroborated by the lack of engagement and failure to specify the role of the key stakeholders in government's institutional framework, and as a result causing delay or resulting to poor implementation of solar energy projects (Bikam and Mulaudzi, 2006 ). In addition to the challenges identified above, lack of awareness, lack of understanding of benefits associated with solar powered products and cultural beliefs remain part of the key barriers to diffusion of solar energy technologies in the three countries. Overreliance on the national grid has been attributed to low level of education on solar PV in Ghana (Bawakyillenuo, 2009 ). According to Duke et al., (2002), lack of awareness and information on certification (as it relates to minimum quality standard of SHS) particularly in the rural areas will create uncertainty in the market as well as slow uptake of solar system in Kenya. A decade later, this trend continues to be observed in the Kenyan solar market, where lack of awareness and cultural difference contribute to slow adoption of SHS (Ondraczek, 2013 ; Simiyu et al., 2014 ). Similarly, in South Africa, lack of understanding on SWH installation resulted to limited applications because of the leakages as many of low-income households did not know whom to approach or where to go due to lack of information (Curry et al., 2017 ). Moreover, lack of community awareness in many part of South Africa, resulted to little information on the benefits of SWH (Donev et al., 2012 ). Yet it often appears that lack of a clear policy direction is a key obstacle to solar industry in many African countries. In Egypt, lack of government policy that targets R&D investment in concentrated solar plant (CSP) continues to affect solar market despite CSP technology having the highest potential as most important energy source for the future in the country (Shouman and Khattab, 2015 ). Added to this, Patlitzianas (2011)  argued that direct subsidies to crude oil can be a serious obstacle to the development of CSP market in Egypt despite government's awareness of negative impacts of subsidized conventional fuels, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Similarly, despite recent passage of renewable energy law in Morocco, policies and regulations that could have a positive impact on long-term investment for CSP technology and SWH are lacking (Medina et al., 2015 ). The lack of a consistent renewable energy policy means that uptake of solar energy technologies could be slow, thus causes slow growth of local solar industry. This is consistent with the experts' viewpoints that policy constraint remains a major problem to development of the solar industry in Africa.  5 Conclusion and policy implications The study has shown that solar energy technologies can contribute to achievement of SDGs in Africa. As described in Section 3 , the multi-functional capacities of solar energy technologies can play a significant role towards the implementation of SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 13. The inter-linked nature of SDGs creates opportunities to maximise the usage and problem solving that relate to the adoption of solar powered products in Africa. In view of current challenges, the implementation of solar projects across African countries requires drastic measures particularly with regards to sustainable financing, market development and research and development programs, among others. The application or adoption of solar energy in the continent will require an integrated policy approach to leapfrog the technologies as current approach remains fragmented and uncoordinated. Without a joint effort spearheaded by the national government that allows the participation of relevant stakeholders, it may be difficult for many African countries to deploy solar energy technologies particularly in the context of implementing the 2030 Agenda as well as achieve the SDGs. As indicated in several studies included in this study, most solar energy projects especially SHS are funded by donors. The sustainability and system maintenance of solar energy projects across Africa has been questioned in light of the failure to finance various solar projects beyond a certain period of time. As demonstrated in Section 4 , some solar energy projects in Ghana, Kenya and South Africa have been abandoned or weakly implemented, partly due to lack of financial continuity and limited involvement of national government. Similar problem has been experienced across Africa. As another example, in Zimbabwe, solar dealers were forced to withdraw from PV project as soon as financial support from GEF ended (Mulugetta et al., 2000 ). It is not enough to address socio-economic concerns through donor driven approach but what happens after donor support ends can be important in determining whether or not long-term effort to support solar energy projects (scaling up a pilot program and technology diffusion) is present. Despite Africa being the second largest recipient of the World Bank support for solar energy programs (Yang, 2017 ), impacts still remain limited particularly at the rural community level where solar powered products are needed most. Therefore, donor's solar programs need to move beyond short-term approaches in order to facilitate the implementation of SDGs and contribute to overall sustainable growth in Africa. Overcoming current challenges would mean that the country's governments, donors, private sectors and non-governmental organisations form a formidable partnership and develop long-term planning and strategic approaches for the implementation of solar energy projects. The achievement of relevant SDG targets through the adoption of solar energy technologies lie in the consumers’ ability to afford solar powered products that are supported with the appropriate government policies. Current evidence suggests that low-income households cannot afford, for example, SHS products, thereby slowing down solar market development in many part of Africa. Overcoming high risk of financing solar energy projects in the rural areas requires establishing a strong linkage between the financial institutions and solar companies in order to create sustainable market structures (Lemaire, 2011 ; Pode, 2013 ) (World Bank, 2010 ). Developing a robust policy that targets micro-finance institutions and solar companies in the rural settings where small-medium enterprise can benefit from the adoption of solar powered products is key to developing local solar market. This has been relatively successful in some part of Ghana, where consumers and suppliers have benefited from a line of credits and incentives programs through the Rural and Community Banks that offset additional costs (Steel et al., 2016 ). Similarly, the removal of tariffs by the Kenya Government can be in part attributed to wide spread of SHS system in Kenya (Ondraczek, 2014 ). Moreover, findings suggest that a wider dissemination of SHS and SWH not only provided socio-economic benefits but also environmental benefits to small medium enterprise and large-scale business in Ghana and South Africa, respectively, especially in reducing indoor air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions (Donev et al., 2012 ; Sekyere et al., 2012 ; Steel et al., 2016 ). One could argue that tailoring policy initiatives towards specific solar markets (i.e., entrepreneurial usage) can enhance the penetration of solar powered products. Regardless of delivery mechanism arranged to introduce solar energy, poor households at the bottom of pyramid will still depend on subsidies (at least to a large extent) to reduce operating costs. With targeted policy measures, increased dissemination of reliable, clean and affordable solar powered system can contribute to achievement of SDG7 and SDG 13 targets. As the bulk of energy application in Africa is largely met by fossil fuels, the need to increase solar energy uptake due to its enormous potential is critical to addressing part of energy problems in the continent. African solar industry is faced with the maintenance problem, notably for cheap and low-quality components of solar energy products. This is regarded as one of the biggest problems facing the solar industry (Fig. 3 a, c, b). Addressing this problem will require setting up local manufacturing units in targeted areas to serve customers and stimulate local market. This can be spearheaded by the research and academic institutions to coordinate and facilitate R&D programs. The availability of local manufacturing units will not only address installation, repair and maintenance problems, but encourages training and create jobs for local technicians. This can only be achieved by a thorough assessment of current technical problems and increased investment in solar R&D programs to overcome this particular challenge. Basic and applied research is part of main R&D activities and is key to advancing new knowledge and enhancing technological innovation (Foxon et al., 2005 ). All of this can be taken care of through the establishment of solar energy research institutions across different regions in Africa. Without a doubt, solar R&D programs will put Africa in a better position to develop new technologies that are locally adapted to install and maintain solar powered products. Anecdotal evidence suggests that only South Africa country is moving in this direction as national research program is targeting rapid expansion of solar industry through investment in solar R&D (Jadhav et al., 2017 ). South Africa and the rest of African countries will have to overcome a lot of challenges in view of the solar market that is currently dominated by Chinese companies. One effective approach is to establish a robust legal framework for the intellectual property (IPR) that may impede solar innovation arising from R&D activities. Establishing a strong and functional institution will not only address IPR logjam but also facilitates research collaboration and technology transfer between the continent and advanced countries. Therefore, harnessing solar innovation through investment in solar R&D programs can contribute significantly to the implementation of SDGs in Africa and ultimately to sustainable economic growth in the continent. In view of promoting sustainable economic growth in Africa, it is also important to emphasise and encourage decarbonisation of the African power sector through solar energy technologies so as to contribute to the achievement of SDG13 targets and the implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement. While several SWH projects were implemented in South Africa during the MDG era, lack of performance assessment was in part due to the small size of the project, thereby making it difficult to be directly linked to the achievement of MDGs. Given the nationally determined contributions of the Paris Agreement and SDG13, African governments and international community must pay attention to the performance assessment especially by encouraging appropriate set of indicators to monitor the progress of SDGs during the implementation of solar energy projects. In summary, the key to addressing the issues raised in this study is which policy intervention by the country governments and international actors are likely to expand and facilitate solar uptake in Africa. The most prominent sets of policies are feed-in-tariffs, incentive programs and renewable energy laws which continue to encourage renewable energy utilization and investment in solar energy sector around the world. In Europe, USA and China, feed-in-tariffs are the primary mechanisms used to support development of solar energy, and have been applied in several EU member countries (Solangi et al., 2011 ). According to Solangi et al. (2011) , a set of regulations have been designed by the central government and local government to encourage and support solar power industry growth in China. In addition, on top of government priority list across leading solar producing countries is the policy-driven innovation that targets increased investment in the field of energy research and development (Foxon et al., 2005 ; Solangi et al., 2011 ). Taken together, these factors will continue to drive the global solar market in the next decades. This underlying evidence supports that solar industry can be fostered by providing an appropriate policy instrument that also enhances domestic and global competiveness. African countries need to chart its own path to develop and implement renewable energy programs including solar energy. Effective implementations of renewable energy policy offer an opportunity for significant expansion of solar market in Africa. Given the potential solar market of 63 million households in sub-Sahara Africa (Duke and Kammen, 2003 ), it can make a huge impact in poor people's lives especially through rural electrification, thereby contributing to the achievement of SDGs.
