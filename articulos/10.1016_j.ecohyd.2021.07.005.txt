                  Ecohydrology, as an integrating discipline, can contribute strongly to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) especially in the context of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM). Using ecohydrology principles in applying IWRM affords a better understanding of the links between water, biodiversity, and human wellbeing in the catchments. One problem with the SDGs is that they are presented in a “silo” style, which means there are few if any connections between SDG6 “clean water and sanitation” and SDG 15 “life on land”, which deals with wetlands and catchments. Ecohydrology principles, drawing on the need to better understand green and blue infrastructure, can help bridge between the SDGs in an IWRM context, allowing thus for their more successful achievement.
                  The Convention on Wetlands (Ramsar, 1971) has degrees of overlap and redundancy with the UNECE Water Convention (1992). And both rely on better science, policy, and management of catchments for effective implementation. Ecohydrology can help promote and develop the science base of these Multilateral Environment Agreements allowing for interpretation of catchment processes and dynamics, and thus better application of IWRM, and ultimately better policies for management of water resources, and thus alleviation of water scarcity.
                  Ecohydrology can also play a role in fostering social science research in catchments, heritage management and conservation. So far in UNESCO, ecohydrology has been largely dealt with by the International Hydrological Programme, in the Division of Water Sciences. There is a future role for ecohydrology as a cross-cutting theme across all UNESCO Sectors, led by the Natural Sciences Sector.

The latter reached 50 years in 2021, as did the Convention on Wetlands (Ramsar, Iran, 1971) – of which UNESCO is the depositary. IHP has four more years to reach 50 but, like MAB and the Ramsar Convention, is of that active decade of environmental awakening and initial action – the 1970’s. MAB has evolved from a largely research led programme to one now largely focused on the global network of over 700 Biosphere Reserves, while IHP has evolved into a holistic programme to facilitate research and capacity building for better global water resources management. Some 30 years ago the MAB and IHP programmes jointly contributed to development of early concepts for the newly emerging paradigm of ecohydrology, but in recent decades ecohydrology has blossomed within the framework of IHP. IHP has a history of working through “phases” and has just completed a seven-year long eighth phase (IHP-VIII) that sought to discover the transformative changes required for more effective management of water resources, with a view to alleviating water scarcity. Among many topics, the programme included an examination of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), ecohydrology and governance. However, there was little focus on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or multilateral agreements that deal with water issues, and thus help achieve the SDGs. The purpose of this brief commentary is to examine how ecohydrological approaches especially can help understand how to implement IWRM, deliver the SDGs and help develop Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs) with a water focus (so-called water conventions). It also examines how UNESCO can become an even more effective international hub for water issues, through building on its record of assisting the development of ecohydrology. 1.1 Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) IWRM has been defined as “a process which promotes the coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources in order to maximise economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems” (Global Water Partnership 2000 ; 2009 ). IWRM includes catchments, river basins and watersheds and so comprises many ecosystems, including ground waters, rivers, lakes, swamps, mires, and human-generated wetlands such as reservoirs and paddy fields, all set in a wider landscape or wetscape (Bridgewater and Kim 2021 ). Historically, these catchment water systems are linked to the development of civilizations, perhaps even our species itself (Chan et al. 2019 ; Hammond et al. 2021 ). Many ancient civilizations grew and flourished along rivers or other large sources of freshwaters. Not all such civilisations survived, many collapsing because of water scarcity induced by climate and/or other anthropic changes. Even as human society acquired more environmental knowledge, poor water management is still happening across the world with examples such as shrinkage of the Aral and Caspian seas in central Asia and mismanagement of many rivers, including the iconic Amazon, Niger, Murray-Darling, Colorado, Indus, and Yellow Rivers (e.g., Micklin 2007 ; Goulden & Few 2011; Forsberg et al. 2017 .). Although traditionally focussed on science and engineering approaches, IWRM can integrate different knowledges and worldviews, from science to local to indigenous (Krause and Strang 2016 ). Indeed, as the biodiversity community is realising (IPBES 2019 ), local, indigenous, and traditional knowledge can also contribute to solving contemporary biodiversity, water resource and disaster management challenges. Many Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities understood and understand the importance of integrated water management, yet in the global north this did not seriously obtain until the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development1  1 https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/milestones/unced    . The issue was subject to much discussion at that global gathering, and was taken up, inter alia , in the subsequent discussions of the Commission on Sustainable Development over the following decade. The strength of IWRM is that it integrates concerns of diverse stakeholders from a range of sectors and interest groups. IWRM is most often represented as being a cross-cutting mechanism to ensure water availability for people, food, nature, industry, and to try and avoid or resolve conflicts over water allocation and use. IWRM can be highly mechanistic but has also the potential to be an adaptive approach, like the Convention on Biological Diversity Ecosystem Approach (Convention on Biological Diversity 2004 ) that includes conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity alongside water management and use, through both “hard” and “soft” engineering approaches (e.g., grey versus blue-green infrastructure – see European Commission 2013 ; JNCC 2019 ).Thirty years on, and given establishment of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (UNGA 2015 ), there is now renewed possibility for seeing IWRM in a refreshed light. And this can allow incorporation of an integrating element so-far missing – ecohydrology as a major science and evidence basis for development and application of IWRM policies. Russi et al. (2013)  note that “Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM)…. if properly applied, allow(s) decision makers to simultaneously achieve multiple objectives (e.g., ensuring water, food, and energy security, mitigating, and adapting to climate change, alleviating poverty) and to deal with the synergies and trade-offs among them”. This “nexus” between water, food, and energy as one of the most fundamental relationships - and increasing challenges - for society. The Intergovernmental Science-policy Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) will undertake an assessment of this nexus, but this is unlikely to be available before 2025. A recent review into economics and biodiversity (Dasgupta 2021 ) quotes Tan-Soo et al. (2016)  as showing “conversion of forests into oil palm and rubber plantation significantly increased the number of flooded days during the wettest months of the year. Specifically, an additional square kilometre of conversion to oil palm or rubber was found to lead to 0.001 additional flood-related deaths and two additional evacuees per year”. So, there are quite direct and immediate links to human wellbeing from mismanagement of watersheds, arising from a lack of knowledge on IWRM, specifically the ecohydrological components. Dasgupta (2021)  also discusses the range of issues that have arisen from Dam construction, both small and large. Barbarossa et al. (2020)  report that the approximately 40,000 high dams that currently exist worldwide have altered 50% of the volume of river water, by either regulation of water flow or fragmentation, and that the pending construction of some 3,700 more high dams will raise the figure to over 90%. Water flow regulation from dams has impacts on ecosystems relying on flowing surface and groundwaters for connectivity, including downstream effects from river and floodplain fragmentation. Measuring the supply of water is much more than monetary valuation, however, and a critical need is to use an ecohydrology approach to approximate how, where and when water flows, and the impact of those flows on biodiversity and ecosystem services.  1.2 The Sustainable Development Goals The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (UNGA 2015 ), agreed in 2012 at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Since their launch in 2015 there have been a great many publications analysing interrelationships and effectiveness of SDGs, e.g., EAT (2016) ; Nilsson et al. (2016) ; ICSU (2017) ; Vörösmarty et al. (2018) ; Weitz et al. (2018) ; Pham-Truffert et al. (2020) . The 17 SDGs each have a series of targets and indicators associated with them. EAT (2016)  suggests Goals 6 (clean water); 13 (climate action); 14 (life under water) and 15 (life on Land) are the foundational goals. While these four SDGs do support the remaining 13, Obrecht et al. (2021)  discuss the idea that coherent policies to achieve all  the SDGs require an understanding of interactions between individual SDGs, and that such interactions may be synergistic or  antithetic. These interactions give rise to the idea that co-benefits can accrue between SDGs thereby accelerating progress, or that trade-offs may be needed to ensure progress. Ecohydrology is a critical scientific framework to help achieve these four foundational goals and their targets by the 2030 end date to achieve sustainable development. Rather than “ecosystem services” the IPBES Global Assessment of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES 2019 ) used the concept of nature's contributions to people (NCP), based on a more comprehensive understanding of human-nature interactions and a wider range of values, including those embedded in Indigenous and Local Knowledge. Progress on achieving the SDGs and their component targets, especially the foundational four, needs to incorporate an analysis of nature's contributions to people (Pascual et al. 2017 ; Díaz et al. 2018 ; McElwee et al., 2020 ) to assist achievement of the SDGs rather than the more traditional ecosystem services. Nonetheless, NCPs are an evolving concept and caution should be exercised when trying to use them where ecosystem services might be more appropriate. Besides helping in the achievement of these four SDGs, the ecohydrology paradigm articulated by Zalewski (2013)  can assist in the de-siloing of the individual SDGs and promote cross-goal actions. Table 1   gives examples of targets for the four foundational SDGs where ecohydrology can provide evidential support on the progress to achievement. Table 1  also shows some of the interlinkages between the different targets for the SDGs, illustrating the multidimensional complexity the SDGs encompass.  1.3 Ecohydrology in Multilateral Environmental Agreements To achieve the SDGs and their included targets some MEAs have critical roles to play. Regarding water, two in particular are important; the Convention on Wetlands (Ramsar, Iran, 1971, or the Ramsar Convention as it is more colloquially known) and the UNECE Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes, 1992 (or UNECE Water Convention as it is more colloquially known). These two MEAs benefit especially from IWRM as an actual or potential implementing mechanism, and thereby ecohydrology as the science and evidence support for policy development. In the context of IWRM, IHP has influenced the UNECE Water Convention through its consideration of a draft framework convention on transboundary aquifers. This originates from the Internationally Shared Aquifer Resources Management (ISARM) joint initiative of UNESCO-IHP, FAO, and the International Association of Hydrogeologists (IAH). Given the many actors involved in managing transboundary aquifers ISARM is transdisciplinary and multidimensional. Burchi (2018)  notes that UNESCO-IHP's seventh phase included developing international and national frameworks for governance of transboundary aquifers in the framework of ISARM. IHP and the International Oceanographic Commission (UNECO-IOC) helped develop a groundwater component in the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Transboundary Waters Assessment Programme (TWAP) that reported in Taluae McManus et al. (2016) . As the links between groundwater, surface water and IWRM become clearer, this work has carried through IHP-VII and informed activities under IHP-VIII. Although from its origins in the Economic Commission for Europe the UNECE water convention was initially focused on ECE member states, in 2013 an amendment allowed accession by all United Nations Member States. The Convention therefore became a global legal and intergovernmental framework for transboundary water cooperation, that could assist implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. Inclusion of a target on transboundary cooperation in SDG6 on water and sanitation represents an important political recognition of transboundary issues, and the need for integrated approaches to water management and this security. There remains some confusion over essentially a parallel convention, the UN Convention on the Law of the Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses 1997 (UN Watercourses Convention). However, this latter convention has attracted very low participation from contracting states, and the UNECE remains the global leader for transboundary water matters. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, there was perhaps prescient thinking amongst UNECE members on the links between environmental water and human health. This thinking resulted in adoption of a Protocol on Water and Health to the convention in 2005. This Protocol's objective is aimed at promoting, at national and international level, protection of human health and well-being, within a framework of sustainable development. It aims to achieve this objective through improving water management, including conservation and wise use of water-related ecosystems, and their component biodiversity. The outbreaks of HPAI (bird flu) in the early years of this century are examples of a globally important disease transmitted via aquatic biodiversity – there are undoubtedly many other such diseases waiting to emerge. As the other key “water” convention, the Ramsar Convention produced a handbook on this issue (Ramsar Convention Secretariat 2010 ), and the tenth meeting of contracting Parties in 2008 had the theme of wetlands and health. The subsidiary body to the Ramsar Convention on science (the Science and Technical Review Panel - STRP) has discussed ecohydrology in the past but invoking the ecohydrology paradigm as a key tool in science support for the convention has yet to occur.   2 Conclusions Figure 1   shows a conceptual framing where IWRM is a central focus for several direct and indirect drivers as input interacting with enablers to produce an outcome (or impact) of better human well-being. In this framing, ecohydrology is shown as supporting an understanding of the roles and functions of the abiotic drivers, and links with biodiversity and ecosystem services. Delivery of knowledge based IWRM through contributions from the key environmental areas of biodiversity, ecosystem services, water and policy instruments that link them is a key role for ecohydrology, as an integrator of both “hard” and “soft” engineering approaches (see e.g., Bridgewater 2018 ). While some drivers are directly linked to physical environmental features, SDGs, MEAs and national policies are all indirect drivers that also impact on the effectiveness of IWRM. In its development ecohydrology has incorporated the ecosystem services paradigm, but the broader conceptualisation of Natures Contributions to People, discussed earlier, needs to form part of the developing ecohydrology rubric. While ecohydrology is broader than biodiversity, there is an opportunity to include the paradigm as part of the new Global Framework on Biodiversity, which is to be agreed at the Fifteenth Convention on Biological Diversity Conference of the Parties and place the ecohydrology paradigm squarely on the agenda of the STRP of the Ramsar Convention at its next Conference of the Parties in spring of 2022. Discussions in the UNECE (and the still nascent UN Convention on Transboundary Waters) should also seek to take a more ecohydrological turn, best accomplished through closer links to the UNESCO science programmes, notably IHP. The 2018 World Water Development Report manged by UNESCO for UNWATER (United Nations 2021 ) dealt with so-called Nature-based solutions and included work on ecohydrology. And yet that Reports 2021 edition contains no reference to ecohydrology, which is very surprising given the provenance of ecohydrology in UNESCO, and the role that ecohydrology has in helping understand the value of water (the report's theme). This leads to the idea that more links and focus are needed within Maison UNESCO  to use, and continue to support development of, ecohydrology. Even within the Natural Sciences Sector, IHP is in a different division from Ecological and Earth Sciences, with Social Sciences, Education and Culture in other sectors again. There is no doubt that this separation of UNESCO activities into sectors and divisions has promoted siloisation of ideas and actions. Paradoxically, then, as IHP has over 30 years been becoming more inter-disciplinary, UNESCO is becoming organised more in silos. There exists, therefore, a strong case for UNESCO to take a renewed look at its organisational arrangements to allow highly successful programmes like IHP and MAB to be loosely led by one sector but have free and multiple interactions across the set of actors within and without UNESCO. While there are “demosites” for ecohydrology (IHP 2015 ) there is enormous scope for the UNESCO-MAB World Network of Biosphere Reserves (and perhaps Global geoparks) to become testbeds for IHP research-led ideas on IWRM and related water matters. Global sustainability will not be guided by ideas and science alone – on-ground experiential activities in secure spaces are crucial. So, to implement SDG 6 on water, SDG 13 on climate change, SDG 14 for coastal zones and SDG 15 for life on land, we need a better focus on all aspects of water - biodiversity interactions; from human use to water in ecosystems, through the IWRM lens. And to achieve that better evidence and science is needed - in other words a better role for ecohydrology as a science-policy interface for the MEAs as they strive to achieve the SDGs.   Declaration of Competing Interest I attest there is no conflict of interest and I received no funding for this work. Between 1999 and 2003 I was Director of the Division of Ecological Sciences in UNESCO, and represented Australia on the Man & the Biosphere Intergovernmental Co-Ordinating Council between 1996 -1999 and currently from 2017.  Acknowledgements I acknowledge the many colleagues with whom I have shared discussions on these topics over the years, and two anonymous referees for much improving the manuscript.
