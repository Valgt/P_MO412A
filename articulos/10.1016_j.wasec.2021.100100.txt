                  The United Nations has adopted accelerators – policies or programs that target multiple SDGs – to expedite delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This rapid review examines the potential application of accelerators in water interventions from 2015 to 2020, with special consideration of how gender is integrated to fast-track SDG implementation as a cross-cutting case. While 86% of water projects acknowledged SDG interlinkages, project indicators did not reflect SDG acceleration objectives. For example, despite widespread acknowledgement of gender as a critical SDG issue, only a fifth of projects applied gender-related accelerators, and the bulk lacked strategic gender dimensions that addressed systemic roots of inequality. This suggests a strategic opportunity for the water sector to accelerate SDG progress through greater integration of cross-cutting programming.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria   Populations Geographical area was restricted to low and middle-income countries (LMICs) as defined by the World Bank [34] . Types of participants and settings within LMIC were not restricted.  Interventions Inclusion: Any policies or programs that 1) primarily involved fresh water, 2) aimed to directly impact intended beneficiaries, 3) had an evaluation or assessment, and 4) noted gender considerations in-text. Exclusion: Projects that 1) targeted seawater or non-fresh water, 2) were of formative nature (i.e., conceptual development, prevalence or risk assessment, interventions yet to be implemented, policy proposal, or programming recommendations).  Types of studies/study designs Published literature:• Inclusion: Primary research and original studies of experimental nature.  • Exclusion: Studies of observational nature (i.e., no interventions implemented), clinical studies, and secondary syntheses (e.g., systematic reviews).   Grey literature:• Inclusion: Reports of intervention programs.  • Exclusion: Other types of documentation that did not detail project implementation and evaluation (e.g., meeting minutes, presentation slides, briefing notes, speeches, and news).     Timeframe Only studies published from 2015 to search date were included. Since the SDGs were adopted by the UN in 2015 and this review focused on programming efforts that accelerate SDG outcomes, this five-year timeframe was considered appropriate and justifiable to limit the scope of the literature search.

Gender-blind Gender-aware Gender-sensitive Gender-responsive Gender-transformative   An approach to research that ignores gender as a determinant and homogenously considers populations and/or issues areas, which can perpetuate the status quo or even worsen inequalities. An approach to research wherein gender (i.e., the differentiated and intersectional experiences of women, men, boys, girls, and gender-diverse persons) is considered in the research project’s rationale, but is not an operative concept in the design and methodology for implementation. An approach to research that considers gender in the research project’s rationale and addresses it in the project design and methodology, but does not (yet) extend to analysis and action to address gender inequalities. An approach to research that considers gender in the project’s rationale, design, and methodology, and is rigorously analyzed to influence strategies and inform implementation and communication. An approach to research that examines, analyzes, and builds an evidence base to inform long-term practical changes in structural power relations and norms, roles, and inequalities that define the differentiated experiences of people of all genders. Transformative research should lead to sustained  change through action such as participatory data collection and priority-setting, partnerships, outreach, and interventions.

The United Nations has adopted accelerators – policies or programs that target multiple SDGs – to expedite delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This rapid review examines the potential application of accelerators in water interventions from 2015 to 2020, with special consideration of how gender is integrated to fast-track SDG implementation as a cross-cutting case. While 86% of water projects acknowledged SDG interlinkages, project indicators did not reflect SDG acceleration objectives. For example, despite widespread acknowledgement of gender as a critical SDG issue, only a fifth of projects applied gender-related accelerators, and the bulk lacked strategic gender dimensions that addressed systemic roots of inequality. This suggests a strategic opportunity for the water sector to accelerate SDG progress through greater integration of cross-cutting programming.

Five years into the 2030 Agenda’s implementation, the UN has warned that the world is off-track and the majority of 169 indicators will not likely be met by 2030. The UN thus announced a ‘Decade of Action’ call in 2020 to mobilize governments, civil society, and the private sector to collectively accelerate the speed and scale of SDG delivery [2] . Implementation of SDG accelerators have gained traction as a potential means of fast-tracking achievement of the 2030 Agenda. This modality is drawn from the private technology sector. Since the early 2000s, accelerators have provided intensive knowledge and financial support to nascent ‘tech’ startups during early venture stages [3] . Akin to incubators delivered over a limited duration of time, the aim of participating in an accelerator is to reduce the costs and timelines for developing marketable services or products [3,4] . While tech accelerators typically have the same financial goals (of obtaining venture funding and achieving profitability), the framing and mechanisms by which goals are achieved are heterogenous [5] . Accelerators are understood in the UN as development policies or programs that can expedite goal achievement – specifically, the SDGs in this case [6] . There are two widely accepted definitions of accelerators at the UN. The first conceptualization focuses on programmatic elements that fast-track achievement a specific SDG [7,8] . In contrast, the more popular understanding focuses on an accelerator’s potential to trigger positive effects across multiple SDGs by tapping into programmatic synergies and aligning programming with targets from more than one SDG [6,9,10] . Good governance and gender equality, for example, have been highlighted as a mechanism of multi-dimensional programmatic success across multiple SDGs [11,12] . While the multi-SDG accelerator concept has yet to be empirically validated, Cluver et al. found that the accelerator approach is an innovative policy solution to enhance achievement of SDG outcomes across economic, social, and environmental development domains through combined delivery efforts [9] . Given the popularity of accelerators in the private sector, and the need to facilitate SDG achievement, the latter definition of accelerators has been promoted within the UN as a means to fast-track achievement by focusing on interlinkages in the 2030 Agenda [6] . Historically, public administrations worldwide have found implementing ambitious national and global policies to be challenging because organizations and sectors often operate in sectoral and institutional silos [13–15] . While the SDGs’ adoption indicated a mandate for greater integrated policymaking [16] , implementation of the 2030 Agenda continues to be stymied due to limited implementation of integrated policies [17–19] . Thus, new operative modes are warranted to address fragmented governance by identifying unrealized synergies [20] . It hence is unsurprising that cross-cutting SDG accelerators has gained so much traction in the run-up to the 2030 deadline. This rapid review examines the potential application of SDG accelerators in water projects to fast-track achievement of the 2030 Agenda. Water interventions potentially contribute to various SDGs, as clean water and sanitation are critical determinants of healthy communities, robust terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, productive economies, and peaceful societies [19,21–23] . While there is a growing number of programs that contribute to different SDGs with regards to water quality interlinkages [24] , and, notably, the water-gender nexus [25–28] , there has been limited understanding of how water-related interventions can accelerate progress beyond SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation). Using gender as a case, this review also provides a synthesis of evidence for the potential of greater integration of cross-cutting issues for multiplier effects. While gender equality has been identified as an accelerator [12] , there remains a need to improve integration in the water sector. Gendered issues in the water sector – such as the unequal burden women and girls bear in retrieving water, being the primary water collectors in eight out of ten households, and often traveling long distances to do so [29]  – have time and again been identified as key challenges, but few interventions have addressed gender relations in a transformational way (e.g., interrogating power relations, gender roles, and norms in multidisciplinary projects) [30] . The paper lastly reflects on the utility of emerging tools to provide timely guidance to facilitate coordination of the 2030 Agenda and target critical policy gaps in low- and middle-income countries.  2 Methods 2.1 Inclusion criteria This review followed a five-staged iterative process described by Arksey and O’Malley [31]  and adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines [32]  and Dobbins’ rapid review guidance [33] . Inclusion and exclusion criteria were outlined in an internal protocol document that ensured consensus during screening (Table 1  ) and guided analysis.  2.2 Database search A search of 11 databases and 15 organizational websites was conducted. Keywords and search parameters were adapted for peer-reviewed literature databases in health; social, political, and interdisciplinary sciences; and engineering (Table 2  ). The search string used for Medline, Embase, and Global Health databases can be found in Annexes 1–2 . The search strategy was adapted for Google’s Advanced Search function (Annex 3 ) to conduct a grey literature review of water programming by 15 UN institutions involved in water intervention implementation in support of the SDG agenda (Table 3  ). The focus on UN bodies was justified as the UN is the custodian of the SDGs, and collaborative work in LMICs with development partners was likely to be co-published by the UN and their collaborators. Searches were conducted between January 1, 2015 and March 11, 2020 for published literature; and between January 1, 2015 and June 10, 2020 for grey literature. Synonyms of “water” AND “SDG” AND “gender” AND “LMIC” AND “implement” were selected to build search strings. The latter group is based on intervention-related terms in the UNDP accelerator assessment tool (See Section 2.4 ). The key terms “water” and “implement” and their synonyms were searched in titles and abstracts only, while the rest were searched in all fields.  2.3 Screening and data extraction The selection criteria were determined a priori (see Table 1 ). For peer-reviewed literature, Covidence was utilized for double-blind screening of title/abstracts and full texts. For grey literature, two reviewers independently screened search results’ titles, blurbs, and full texts directly in the Google Advanced Search webpage. The number of grey literature records identified as reported in Fig. 1   reflects the number of records after screening. Conflicts regarding project inclusion were resolved by discussion at each screening stage. Extracted data was reviewed by the primary author based on a predetermined template outlining intervention characteristics (project design, geographic region, sector, target population, water association, project description, and key findings), targeted SDGs, and a gender integration rating. SDG data were either specified in the studies or identified by reviewers based on the intervention’s objectives and evaluative criteria if SDG targets were not specified.  2.4 Data analysis Evidence maps were generated to provide visual representation of the evidence base [35,36]  for SDGs targeted, accelerators and level of gender integration in water projects. A color-coded system (grey: 0 projects, red: 1 project, yellow: 2 to 4 projects, and green: ≥5 projects) was used to identify evidence availability and gaps. Project results were synthesized by water theme and the 17 SDGs. Two UN tools informed the classification of accelerator type in the study. UNDP’s guidance broadly grouped accelerators in terms of thematic policy areas that can catalyze impact across multiple SDGs. For example, accelerators can contribute to a range of economic (e.g., entrepreneurship), social (e.g., youth empowerment) or environmental (e.g., greening infrastructure) policy dimensions or domains for two or more SDGs [6] . UN-Water, in contrast, defined five program mechanisms as SDG 6 accelerators [7] :1. Financing: Optimization of existing resources and support for investment models to close siloed funding gaps.  2. Data and information: Improved data generation and sharing to enhance decision-making and increase accountability.  3. Capacity development: Workforce education and training, from local laborers to government policymakers and service providers.  4. Innovation: Leveraging and scaling of practices and technologies that can disrupt and transform practice.  5. Governance: Establishment of clear roles and interlinked responsibilities to align mandates, strengthen institutions and support intersectoral coordination.    This review applies both UNDP policy-oriented and UN-Water’s mechanisms when assessing and classifying accelerators in the study. When identifying policy-oriented accelerators, the authors reflected on whether the objective of the program of action was to enable progress on the development priority, or target a specific policy outcome in which a key area in which progress is lagging (e.g., gender equality) [6] . Multiple accelerators could be identified in multi-objective interventions. A gender integration scale complemented the use of acceleration frameworks. It was used to analyze how a cross-cutting issue was incorporated at different project stages. The gender scale utilized in this review was the United Nations University (UNU) gender integration scale [37]  (Table 4  ). This scale draws upon gender integration scales developed by bilateral and UN agencies [38,39] ; in particular, IDRC’s conceptualization of four programmatic gender lenses – from gender-aware projects that broadly addressed gender in project rationales; to gender-sensitive projects that include gender considerations in methodology but do not have an extensive gender analysis; to gender-responsive projects that include an extensive gender analysis but does not address root causes of gender disparity; and gender-transformative projects that target root causes of inequity [40] . The UNU scale added a fifth classification (gender-blind projects), which indicates no evident gender considerations in programming.  2.5 Limitations The search parameters only covered projects that explicitly mentioned the SDGs and included descriptions and evaluations of implementation. Admittedly, these parameters might have restricted the number of eligible projects and some water themes which may render localised issues underrepresented. However, the “SDG” keyword helped target projects that intentionally framed interventions in the context of global agendas as a SDG accelerator should. Local programming may have potential to contribute to the global agenda, but if they were not designed with the global agenda in mind, they might not be generalizable, which limits their ability to be applied in other settings or scaled up. For future studies, additional databases and organizations within water and gender sectors may be considered to expand the search. Additionally, the gender-blind label may not be reflective of all project objectives or the implementing organization’s principles. Projects ranked as gender-blind were categorized as such because gender was overlooked in the methods and/or analysis. For example, the UNICEF (2019a) assessment on healthcare WASH facilities in Kenya was categorized as gender-blind as there was no explicit reference to gender in the case study’s methods or analysis sections. Both UNICEF and the Government of Kenya, however, recognize gender equality in principle. The reason for this oversight might be due to the tendency in the development sector to work in silos, as reflected in the reviewed publications focusing on water-related (as opposed to gender-related) objectives. For grey literature, only websites of UN-related organizations were screened using Google Advanced Search due to the assumption that these organizations would have substantial documentation of their extensive work that directly tied to SDGs. However, even though many resources from UN collaborators and partners were found on UN websites, documents that satisfied the inclusion criteria were limited, mainly because these documents reported results and provided limited details (if any) on project implementation and evaluation, which are inclusion criteria for this review. Excluding non-English literature might have resulted in projects described in other languages being overlooked. While inclusion of non-English projects can avoid bias [41] , studies have indicated that English literature covers most research and thus non-English exclusion should not significantly affect findings [42,43] .   3 Results 3.1 Project selection A total of 42 projects in 33 articles and reports published between 2015 and 2020 met the inclusion criteria (Fig. 1 ). Data extracted from the 42 projects is featured in Annex 4 . All projects were based in LMICS, with 95% implemented in Africa and Asia (n = 40, Fig. 2  ). Six projects focused solely on rural populations, whereas 16 projects placed emphasis on rural areas in combination with urban or school populations. The remaining 20 projects focused on other populations, ranging from users (informal settlement residents and refugees) to project implementers (service providers and governments) and researchers.  3.2 SDG projects Fig. 3   illustrates the review’s breadth of SDG coverage, with 36 of the 42 (86%) projects targeting two or more SDGs. In total, 16 of the 17 SDGs were targeted, with no project focusing on SDG 7 (energy). Fig. 4   illustrates the water sector’s thematic SDG targeting in an evidence map. Overall, most projects focused on WASH, agriculture, or water resources management. Projects from these three major themes contributed not only to SDG 5 and 6, but also to SDGs 1–3 and 8. The evidence map revealed limited programmatic evidence on water security and water-related ecosystems interventions. Most projects (93%, n = 39) contributed to SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), which is expected as this review focuses on interventions in the water sector. The three projects not associated with SDG 6 had an SDG-2 (zero hunger) emphasis. Two projects focused on the management of water-related climate disasters from an agricultural standpoint [45,46]  and the third on small-scale fisheries security [47] . These projects were included due to their utilization of water resilience practices in food production. Annex 5  provides further details on acceleration through the combination of SDG 6 and gender equality, health, economic growth, and climate action objectives in 39 SDG-6 projects. The next section discusses the application of accelerators in 36 water projects.  3.3 Accelerators Fig. 5   depicts the coverage of 11 mechanisms or policy-oriented accelerators in 36 water projects. The remaining six projects did not address more than one SDG, thereby not qualifying as an accelerator. Project accelerators drew from several disciplines ranging from policy studies, economics, health, and environmental science. Of the UN-Water classifications [7] , enhanced governance was the most common accelerator (28%, n = 10), which was applied across WASH [48–51] , conservation [52] , aquaculture [47] , and agricultural development [45,53]  projects. A fifth of projects (19%, n = 7) were innovative when assessing WASH technologies [54,55]  or applying climate-smart methods in agriculture and flood management [45,53,56] . Innovation projects used non-conventional methods and technologies to accelerate progress (such as implementation of water tariffs, carbon water filters or micro-watershed approaches). Nearly a fifth of projects (17%, n = 6) were survey-oriented, and hence had a strong data and information emphasis to assess impact of WASH interventions in households [54,57] , schools [58]  and in three country-level health facility interventions [51] . Finance was used to accelerate SDG achievement in four projects (11%) focused on enhancing water supply and treatment [59]  and building rural community resilience to climate change-associated droughts [45,53,56] . Six further policy-oriented accelerators were identified following UNDP dimensions framing [6] . These accelerators either enhanced intervention design to enabled development progress in five projects (14%) in the WASH [58,60–62]  and agriculture sectors [45] , or aimed for a lagging program outcome linked to behavior change, infrastructure design, female participation, gender equality, or economic development. A fifth of the projects (19%, n = 7) utilized WASH behavior change programming in communities [60,63–65] , schools [66] , or in mixed household-school settings [61,67] . Two (6%) WASH projects provided recommendations to redesign infrastructure in India’s national sanitation policy based on user needs, especially for females [48,49] . Interestingly, while this review covered 12 SDG 6 and 5 projects, it is important to note that only six of these projects applied a gender-associated accelerator. The six projects targeted either female participation or gender equality. Two (6%) projects included women in climate planning processes [46]  and employed them in a water infrastructure project that also utilized local economic development as an accelerator [68] . Four projects (11%) went beyond female participation by targeting root causes of gender disparity and aiming for gender equality in watershed management [56] , agriculture [46] , WASH [62]  and higher education [69] . Of the 36 projects with accelerators, 13 (36%) applied multiple accelerators. Twelve of these projects (eight WASH, one water supply and treatment and two agriculture) variably combined two of the 11 accelerators. The thirteenth project applied three accelerators (governance, financing, and innovation) to reform dated water management laws, identify new tariffs, and develop adaptation strategies in rural farming communities [53] . A closer analysis suggests that broadness in either objectives or perspectives was a common characteristic. Five projects had multiple objectives [48,49,54,60,61] . Seven projects were intersectoral in nature: two employed vulnerable populations as laborers in water infrastructure projects [45,68] ; two integrated climate, environmental and water knowledge to strengthen governance and capacity development initiatives [53,69] ; and three supported WASH in institutional settings [51,58] .  3.4 Gender integration The evidence map (Fig. 6  ) indicates limited gender integration in water security and water-related ecosystems interventions. Notably, while WASH interventions account for the largest proportion among the six water intervention themes, the gender lens employed is mostly limited to a gender-sensitive level. Gender-sensitive projects made up half of the projects (48%, n = 20). This means gender was considered in the project’s design and methodology (usually in the form of disaggregated data collection), though the data were not necessarily analyzed. For example, seven gender-sensitive projects integrated gender considerations in their methods by ensuring participation of women in surveys or focus groups, and/or including gender as a sociodemographic variable [50,57,58,60,64,65,70] . Among these gender-sensitive projects, 18 were WASH interventions and two were agriculture and food security interventions. At the lowest scale level, 19% (n = 8) of the projects were gender-blind, meaning gender was overlooked in the projects. Gender-aware interventions comprised 12% (n = 5) of projects, with gender being mentioned in the rationale but not included as a component in the methods or discussion section. 12% (n = 5) of projects were gender-responsive, as they incorporated gender within their methodology and analyzed gender-disaggregated data. Two of these projects collected gender-associated data and analyzed how female participation in comparison to males within WASH interventions can enhance water security and safe behaviors [61,71] . Additionally, the remaining three gender-responsive projects evaluated gender equality gaps in national policies or provided certified training for women [46,47,67,68,71] . Only 4 projects (9%) (n = 4) had gender-transformative objectives. These projects strove for structural changes by going beyond the typical programmatic focus of gender mainstreaming. Instead, they addressed root causes underpinning gender discrimination in government policies and processes when building climate-resilient societies [46,56] , community relationships in WASH programs [62]  and higher education of future WASH sector leaders [69] . These projects also employed clearly defined gender-specific indicators, such as enhancing financial growth for women through increased participation in agricultural practices or bridging the gap in gendered divisions of labor and power through WASH programming, further supporting their gender-transformative function.   4 Discussion 4.1 Accelerators The 86% of included water projects that focused on two or more SDGs tended to be associated with social, health or environmental sciences. Interestingly, the six projects that did not utilize SDG accelerators were evaluations of WASH projects: a rural infrastructure project [71] , a national policy [84] , two school programs [83,86]  and two research tools [70,85] . While these six projects only comprise of a quarter of the WASH projects in the review, it nevertheless highlights that evaluative criterion should cover more than normative facility-related data. Notably, nearly a third of the projects applied multiple accelerators. These projects tended to be multi-objective intersectoral projects that aimed to challenge the status quo by reinventing governance or finance systems, or reforming outdated laws and practices. The evidence maps indicated that water professionals in the WASH, agriculture, and climate change sectors have produced more evidence on SDG accelerators compared to water resource management and ecosystems professionals. WASH professionals, in particular, published several impact evaluations to enhance intervention designs. Such guidance, which often is reflected upon in detail in donor reports but not published grey literature, is useful to widely distribute to build the evidence base for the nascent field of implementation science in the development sector. Further analysis of how integrated and intersectoral SDG acceleration projects, such as those identified in this review, can advance policy processes would especially be of value to strengthen implementation of the 2030 Agenda. The authors found that accelerator frameworks from UNDP and UN-Water were useful assessment tools that helped unpack complex interlinkages between the SDGs, and highlighted potential gaps and opportunities to strategically target multiple SDGs in water interventions, which might especially be useful among LMICs with limited resources and capacity. The tools can potentially aid collective planning efforts and help address the challenge of joined-up or integrating siloed planning, implementation, and evaluation, which reportedly have limited success in both the Millennium Development Goal and Sustainable Development Goals eras [20,72–75] . Greater harmonization of the SDG accelerator concepts (such as definitions and frameworks) can potentially advance implementation of acceleration programs. On the former, UN policy instruments should have common definitions to enable collective goal setting and achievement, and to facilitate comparisons in performance across sectors. Given that the SDGs are inherently interdependent, it is strategic to develop acceleration programs that target multiple SDGs, as opposed to fast-tracking achievement of standalone goals. While this review has focused on program design from an implementation perspective, the research community can also be engaged to enhance conceptualization and tools development. In particular, greater collaboration with the research community can contribute to the development of a harmonized accelerator language, comprehensive taxonomy (by mechanisms/impact categories and themes) and range of cross-cutting evaluation tools (such as the gender scale discussed in the next section) to aid coordinated design, implementation and evaluation of integrated projects.  4.2 Gender integration A gender integration tool was used to assess mainstreaming of this cross-cutting issue across different project stages. Only a fifth of 42 water projects investigated root causes of gender inequality. Most projects (48%) were gender-sensitive, meaning they had gender considerations in their methods but did not or only minimally analyzed this data. If gender-sensitive projects had a gender objective, the projects tended to target what Leahy et al. described as “practical gender needs” [62] . Practical gender programming addresses perceived necessities or living condition inadequacies in a specific context. Strategic gender programming, in contrast, broadly challenges gender inequality by addressing societal gender roles expressed as inequitable divisions of labor, power, and control, especially over one’s body [62] . Such strategic gender programming aligns with the gender-responsive and transformative ratings in the study’s gender integration scale. Only a fifth of 42 water projects investigated root causes of gender inequality. MacArthur et al. (2020) similarly found in a critical review of a decade of WASH-gender literature that few studies engaged with transformational aspects of gender equality [30] . This underuse of strategic and transformative gender programming in the water sector indicates there is much room for improvement to reduce gender inequality in an impactful way through the integration of either gender-responsive or gender-transformative lenses. In hindsight, the limited integration of transformative gender objectives in water interventions perhaps reflects a broader sectoral trend. While the cross-cutting potential of gender equality interventions in development initiatives was highlighted by the 1995 Beijing Platform for Action [76] , SDG 6 has no gender-specific indicators [77] , there is insufficient utilization of gender-disaggregated data or explicit discussions in water projects [78] , as well as a surprisingly limited number of water projects that had gender-specific targets [79] . This is despite the sector’s acknowledgement of the importance of universal access especially amongst women and girls, who often face availability, accessibility and physical safety constraints due to the compound effects of gender-based discrimination [80,81] . If progress is to be made in reducing gender inequality, the systems of power and societal constraints underpinning inequities need to be challenged across all sectors to enable systemic changes. More gender-disaggregated data of high quality is hence needed to inform evidence-based gender equality programming in the water sector [79] , and strategically address inequitable divisions of labor, power and control. Aligning SDG 6 programming to meet the needs of women and gender-diverse populations can potentially advance data collection and policy integration of this cross-cutting issue in the water sector. Data alignment measures include the integration of gender-specific SDG targets in water projects to build the gender equality evidence base. The SDGs have 53 gender-specific indicators – 14 of which are associated with the standalone SDG 5 and the remaining 39 as cross-cutting targets under 10 other SDGs – that either explicitly disaggregate data by gender or target equality as a development objective [77] . Integration of indicator 16.7.2 (Perceptions of inclusion in decision-making, by sex), for example, can readily be incorporated in project surveys or focus groups to shed light on women’s decision-making power, which is a root cause of inadequate water access among women [82] . Gender equality considerations can be integrated into water interventions through multiple ways, putting synergistic progress on the SDGs within the water sector’s reach.   5 Conclusion Given that accelerators are an emerging concept in the development sector, this review examines the potential of accelerators as a policy instrument to expedite the water sector’s contributions to multiple SDGs. It highlights useful instruments that the water sector can utilize to design accelerators during the UN Decade of Action. SDG achievement can significantly be fast-tracked by integrating cross-cutting themes such as gender into project evaluative frameworks. Further research is needed to aid the development of a common language, collection of disaggregated data and design of integrative tools that can facilitate accelerator implementation. Additionally, research on deeper-dives into synergistic accelerators (including other cross-cutting issues such as climate change), as well as more project delivery and evaluation data, is critically needed to strengthen the development sector’s implementation science evidence base. In developing and learning from this evidence base, and systematically using cross-cutting lenses, the water sector can accelerate action across multiple SDGs, bringing us one step closer to achieving the 2030 Agenda.
