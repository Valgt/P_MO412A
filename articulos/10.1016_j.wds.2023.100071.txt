                  Based on the data provided in the 2022 Sustainable Development Report the so-called People pillar, i.e., the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1–5 are studied to elucidate the state of compliance as well as the trends in development for the 193 countries included in the report. Data for all five SDGs were analyzed by partial ordering methodology to rank the countries according to their compliance and their trend toward compliance. The analyses took simultaneously data for all five SDGs into account to get an overall picture of the prosperity midway through the 15 years period for the 17 UN SDGs. It was disclosed that the ten top countries, i.e., whose performance presently best meet with the people goals were Singapore > Belarus = Cyprus = Finland = Uruguay > Iceland > New Zealand > Norway > Croatia > China > Argentine, respectively. In the case of the trends, the top countries were found to be Belarus > Croatia = Japan > Belgium = Denmark = New Zealand = Sweden > Estonia, respectively. Ranking the twelve regions it was disclosed that OECD and the high-income countries are the highest ranked whereas Oceania, Africa, and the low-income countries are the lowest ranked and need considerable help to eventually meet the 5 SDGs. It was further disclosed that SDGs 4 and 5 were the most important indicators for the ranking the individual countries, whereas SDG 1 and SDG 5 were the most important for ranking the twelve regions. The importance of gender equality is stressed.

Keywords SDG  Sustainable development goals  People  State  Trends  Partial ordering  Average ranking    1 Introduction Sustainability is overall based on three main criteria, i.e., economic-, social- and environmental [1] . This is reflected in the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – the global goals - that unanimously were adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015 that went into force by February 1st, 2016. Thus, today - close to the end of 2022 we are approaching a mid-point in the estimated 15 years lifespan of the goals. This calls for some reflections or more concrete: how are we doing? The goals, with their 169 sub-goals and 231 unique indicators are focusing on every aspect of the global society and constitute, or should constitute the framework, i.e., the ‘compass directions’, for countries, regions, districts, companies, organizations, and single persons to operate within to secure the progress, prosperity, and eventually the survival of the planet. The 17 goals can be grouped into five so-called pillars [2 ,3 ] (Table 1  ) each focusing on important areas of our society (Table 1 ) that covers the three dimensions of sustainability, i.e., social, economic, and environmental. It should here be noted that the last two goals - peace and partnership, respectively - constitute separate groups as they are of utmost importance for all the other goals. In the present study, the social criteria of sustainability are in focus - in other words, the pillar ‘People’, i.e., the SDGs 1 (No poverty), 2 (zero hunger), 3 (Good health and well-being), 4 (Quality education), and 5 (Gender equality). SDG 5 has previously been analyzed in detail [4 ,5 ]. Based on the data for 193 countries available through the 2022 version of the “Sustainable Development Report [6] , the present study assess the actual state of the five SDGs of the pillar prosperity as well as the development trends for the individual countries as well as for 12 groups of countries (cf. Table 2  ) [6] . The basic ranking of the countries and groups of countries has been performed by applying partial ordering methodology, a methodology that allows simultaneously to take nto account several indicators (here the five SDGs in pillar prosperity) without any pretreatment like, e.g., the individual weighting of the single SDGs and subsequent aggregation into a composite indicator as often seen [6 ,7-11 ]. Such composite indicators are a priori subject to compensation effects [12] , i.e., a high value in one indicator may be leveled out by a low value for another indicator, which may lead to results that are difficult to interpret. It should in this connection be mentioned that methods like PROMETHEE [13–15] , AHP [16] , ANP [17] , ELECTRE-family [18 ,] and others are all methods to obtain a ranking based on a data matrix and additional supporting information, such as weights, associated with indicators (ELECTRE, PROMETHEE). On one side, these methods are highly sophisticated; however, for a public understanding they are rarely understandable.  2 Method 2.1 Data Within the data material associated with the Sustainable Development Report [6]  the single states are color coded as green, yellow, orange, red, and gray which signalizes ‘Goal Achievement’, ‘Challenges remain’, ‘Significant challenges’, ‘Major challenges’, and ‘Insufficient data’, respectively. The trends are visualized by arrows. Thus ↑, ➚, →, and ↓ that refers to ‘On track or maintaining achievement’, ‘Moderately Increasing’, ‘Stagnating’, and ‘Decreasing’, respectively. For both the state as well as for the trends the color/arrow coding was transferred into numbers: green = 3, yellow = 2, orange = 1, red = 0, and gray = −1, respectively. Likewise, the arrow codes were transferred into ↑ = 3, ➚ = 2, → = 1, and ↓ = 0, respectively. In the case of states two sets of calculations were performed, i.e., 1: excluding countries/groups where data were not available and 2: including all countries/groups associating the lack of data by the value −1. In the case of trends, countries/groups with no data available were excluded from the study.  2.2 Partial ordering methodology Partial ordering is a relation among the objects to be ordered. In mathematical terms, the only relation is “≤” [19–22] . Hence, the “≤” relation is the basis for a comparison of objects and constitutes a graph, the so-called Hasse diagram (see below). Two objects are connected to each other if and only if the relation “x  ≤ y ” holds. A given object, x, is characterized by the a set of indicators rj (x), j  = 1,…,m, and can thus be compared to another object y, characterized by an identical set of indicators rj (y), if(1) r r  ( x )  ≤ r r  ( y )  for all I  = 1 , … , m      It is obvious that Eq. (1)  is a rather strict requirement for having a comparison as at least one indicator value of object x must be lower (the remaining lower or at least equal) to those of object y. In technical terms: Let X be the group of objects studied, i.e., X  = {O1, O2, O3, ……, On}, then object Oy will be ranked higher than object Ox, i.e., Ox ˂ Oy if at least one of the indicator values for Oy is higher than the corresponding indicator value for Ox and no indicator for Oy is lower than the corresponding indicator value for Ox. On the other hand, if rj (Oy) > rj (Ox) for some indicator j and ri (Oy) < ri (Ox) for some other indicator i, Oy and Ox will be called incomparable (notation: Oy ǁ Ox) due to the mathematical contradiction expressed by the conflicting indicator values. A set of comparable objects are called a chain, whereas a set of mutually incomparable objects is called an antichain. In cases where all indicator values for two objects, Oy and Ox, are equal, i.e., rj (Oy) = rj (Ox) for all j, the two objects will be considered as equivalent, i.e., Ox = Oy, which in terms of ranking means that they will have the same rank. 2.2.1 The Hasse diagram The Eq. (1)  is the basis for the so-called Hasse diagram technique (HDT) [19 ,23 ,24 ]. Hasse diagrams are visual representations of partial orders. In a Hasse diagram comparable objects are connected by a sequence of lines [19 ,25 ]. Thus, sets of comparable objects, i.e., fulfilling Eq. (1)  are called chains that in the diagram are connected with lines, whereas sets of mutually incomparable objects, i.e., not fulfilling Eq. (1)  are called antichains. In the diagram the single objects are positioned in levels, typically arranged from low to high (bottom to top in the diagram). It is a general rule that objects are located as high in the diagram as possible. Thus, isolated objects will, by default be located at the top level of the diagram. It is important to make sure that the orientation of the single indicators is identical, e.g., that high values correspond to ‘good’ whereas low values correspond to ‘bad’. In practice this is done by multiplying indicator values by –1 in case where high and low values correspond to ‘bad’ and ‘good’, respectively (cf. 2.5). In the present study the highest located object/country will be assigned rank 1 indicating the ‘best’. The module mHDCl7_1 of the PyHasse software (vide infra) was used for the basic partial ordering calculations and the associated construction of the Hasse diagrams.  2.2.2 Sensitivity—indicator importance The relative importance of the single indicators in play can be determined through a sensitivity analysis [20] . The basic idea is to construct partial ordered sets (posets) excluding the single indicators one at the time. Subsequently, the distances from these posets to the original poset are determined. The indicator, whose elimination from the original poset leads to the maximal distance to the original one, in other words causing the highest degree of changes in the Hasse diagram is most important for the structure of the original partial order. As the effect of elimination single indicators is studied, this kind of sensitivity analysis can be called ‘indicator-related sensitivity’. The sensitivity values were calculated by the sensitivity24_5 module [19]  of the PyHasse software (vide infra).  2.2.3 Average ranking Looking at the Hasse diagram, the level structure constitutes a first approximation to ordering. However, as all objects in a level automatically will be assigned identical orders such an ordering will obviously cause many tied orders. Obviously, it is desirable with a degree of tiedness as low as possible. Hence, ultimately a linear ordering of the single objects is desirable. However, when incomparable objects are included in the ordering, this is obviously not immediately obtainable. Partial order methodology provides a weak order, where tied orders are not excluded, which is obtained by calculating the average order of the single objects as, e.g., described by Bruggemann and Carlsen [26]  The average rankings were calculated applying the LPOMext9_1 [27]  of the PyHasse software (vide infra).  2.2.4 Software All partial-order analyses were conducted using the PyHasse software [28] . PyHasse is programmed using the interpreter language Python (version 2.6). Today, the software package contains around 140 more or less specialized modules. Selected modules may be obtained from the author.    3 Results and discussion Scrutinizing the color coding for the single countries and regions displaying the actual state of the five SDGs (cf. [6] ) it is immediately clear that the scheme is dominated by red and orange colors. Hence, the orange, red, and gray-colored countries constitute approx. 69% of the total 965 entries (5 × 193) and the green colored countries constitute only approximately 7%. The actual distribution for the five SDGs is shown in Table 3   giving an overall picture of to what extent the performance of the 193 countries included in the data material [6]  comply with the five SDGs of the pillar people. The initial partial order analyses of the state of compliance of the countries have been carried out excluding countries where data are missing for one or more of the five SDGs, i.e., looking at a multi-indicator system (MIS) with values only 0, 1, 2, and 3. A subsequent set of analyses included countries with missing data assigning an indicator value of −1 where data are missing. 3.1 Ranking of individual countries Excluding countries with missing data for one or more of the five SDGs leaves 158 countries with a complete set of data (Appendix B ). Based on this MIS the Hasse diagram shown in Fig. 1   was constructed. It should be emphasized that the diagram display only representatives for the single countries as several countries have identical indicator profiles and thus will appear in identical locations in the diagram. This leaves a simplified diagram. In Table 4   the equivalent, i.e., having identical indicator profiles countries are listed. The twelve levels of the diagram (Fig. 1 ) constitute the first simple ranking of the 158 countries. The diagram discloses that the top level, i.e., those countries whose peerformance on an overall level best comply with the pilar people SDGs are Argentina (ARG), China (CHN), Norway (NOR), New Zealand (NZL), and Singapore (SGP), whereas the bottom level contains the 24 countries represented by Angola (AGO). All these countries are characterized by being in “red figures” on all parameters (cf. Appendix B ). Due to the high number of equivalences (cf. Table 4 ), the Hasse diagram (Fig. 1 ) still gives only a somewhat rough picture of the mutual ranking of the 158 countries. A more informative picture was obtained through the calculation of the average ranks. In Table 5   the average ranking of the top countries is given. The bottom rank is occupied by the 24 countries mentioned above the joint ranking was estimated to be 146,5 (135–158). At a first sight, it may seem surprising that, e.g., China (CHN) and Argentina (ARG) that are both located in the top level (level 12) of the Hasse diagram (Fig. 1 ) but are ranked below countries like Belarus (BLR), Croatia (HRV) and Iceland (ISL) are all found in level eleven. However, this is an artifact due to the construction rules of Hasse diagrams. During the construction of the diagram objects (her countries) are always placed as high as possible. Thus, it is seen (Fig. 1 ) that SGP is covering both BLR, HRV, and ISL, whereas ARG and CHN are a maximal element, i.e., not being covered by any other country and consequently placed in the top level. It may further seem surprising that we find countries like, e.g., BLR and CHN so high on the ranking list. First, it should be noted that the data applied here are retrieved before CHN significantly relaxed the restrictions in relation to Covid 19, which, a priori, could be expected to have a major influence on SDG 3 that might have a pronounced influence on SDG 3 (Good health and well-being). However, it should here be emphasized that we simultaneously are looking at the five SDGs 1 – 5. Hence, an estimation of the relative importance of the five SDGs/indicators disclosed that SDG 3 is the least important indicator with a weight of only 8.3%. The two most important indicators are SDG 5 (31.2%) and SDG 4 (23.4%). This agrees with a relatively high percentage of females in the labor force, e.g., in BLR (57.3% and CHN (61.6%) compared top to the world average of 46.3% [29] . Note the data is from 2021. At a first sight, the high rank of Belarus may seem surprising. However, the country is actively engaged in the SDGs implementation at the national level [30] , resulting in a high compliance with the planet people goals. In addition to the above-discussed mutual ordering of single countries, it is of obvious interest to look at the mutual ordering of the regions (cf. Table 2 ). In Table 6   the MIS for the twelve regions is shown. From Table 6  it is clear that OECD and the HIC are equivalent as are Oceania, Africa, and LIC, the latter three in ”red” color for all five SDGs. The resulting Hasse diagram is shown in Fig. 2  . The average ranking of the twelve regions let to the following order: OECD = HIC > UMIC > E_Euro_Asia > LAC > E_S_Asia = MENA > SID > LMIC = Oceania = Africa = LIC, respectively. Looking at the relative importance of the five SDGs/indicators being responsible for the ranking it became clear that only two indicators apparently played an active role in the ranking. Hence, the most important is SDG 1 (No poverty) at 55.6% followed by SDG 5 (Gender equality) at 44.4%, i.e., the other three SDGs play no role in ranking the twelve regions. Apart from the fact that gender equality is still an important factor, it is noted that poverty is an omnipresent issue. According to the World Bank, approximately 650 million people were living in poverty by 2019 [29]  of which 389 million are found in Sub-Saharan Africa and 156 million in South Asia, respectively. The role of gender equality can partly be associated with the above figure with only 46.6% of females in the labor force on a global scale [31] . Gender equality in Europe has previously been studied by Carlsen [32] , Carlsen and Bruggemann [4] , and Carlsen, Bruggemann, and Fattore [5]  and recently the negative impact due to gender inequality in Asia has been reported [33] . For further detailed information on gender equality on a global scale, UNPD report should be consulted [34] . Considering that data are missing for some countries a ranking based on the complete MIS (Appendix C ) was carried out. However, virtually the same 11 countries were found in the top positions, the only difference to the ranking shown in Table 5  is that Norway and Croatia changed positions. Similarly, the ranking of the regions is identical to the above shown.  3.2 Trend analyses In the case of analyzing the trends of development in the people pillar SDGs, countries with missing data are for obvious reasons excluded as trends simply could not be established. Hence, excluding countries with missing data for one or more of the remaining four SDGs leaves 133 countries and eleven regions (LIC is missing) for the trend analyses (Appendix D ). The partial ordering of the 133 countries is illustrated by the Hasse diagram in Fig. 3  . As above it should, by inspecting the diagram, be remembered that only representatives for equivalent countries are shown. The equivalences are shown in Table 7  . The average ranking of the countries based on their respective trend data leads to a picture different from the picture for the actual status (Table 5 ) although we find some of the same countries ranked at the top. Thus, the average ranking discloses BLR > HRV = JPN > BEL = DNK = NZL = SWE > EST > (CAN, FIN, MLT, POL, SGP, SRB, URY, VNM). According to Appendix D , both BLR and HRV are strong in the trend for all 5 SDG, the values being {3,2,2,3,3} and {3,2,3,3,2} respectively, indicating the two countries overall are quite similar. Hence, it was estimated that the probability for BLR > HRV is 53.8% only. At the bottom of the list, we find Sudan (SDN) and Chad (TCD). Turning to the regions we find, not surprisingly the more wealthy countries, i.e.OECD and HIC in the top of the list. Thus, OECD = HIC > E_Euro_Asia > UMIC > E_S_Asia > LMIC > MENA > LAC > SIDS = Africa > Oceania. The regions with significantly fewer resources, like SIDS, Africa and Oceania (cf. Table 2 ) obviously still have a long way to go and most probably need substantial help eventually to meet with the goals. Looking at the trend for the different countries the indicators SDG 4 (Quality education) and SDG 5 (Gender equality) appear as the most important for the ranking by 32.2 and 27.5%, respectively. However, looking at the regions SDG 1 (No poverty) appears as the overwhelming important indicator by 65.0%, whereas SDG 4 and SDG 5, virtually have no influence of the ranking. Possible explanations are as discussed above in relation to the state of compliance.   4 Conclusions and outlook By 2022 we have roughly met the midway of the 15 years period originally stipulated for the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. However, looking at the status as well as the trend in development for the pillar people comprising the Sustainable Development Goals 1 – 5, it can be concluded that the majority of the 193 countries still are seriously lacking in their attempt overall to meet the five SDGs. Hence, only 40 and 31 out of the 193 countries whose performance today comply with the SDG 1 and SDG5, respectively, whereas 45, 130, 102, 51, and 62 countries are marked in “red”, i.e., major challenges are ahead for the five SDGs. For a total of 61 entries data for missing for one or more SDGs. The two most important indicators for the ranking appear to be SDG 5 and SDG 4. On an overall basis the top countries, i.e., whose performance best complying with the SDGs 1–5 appear to be Singapore > Belarus = Cyprus = Finland = Uruguay > Iceland > New Zealand > Norway > Croatia > China > Argentine, whereas a large group of countries {AGO, BDI, BEN, BFA, CAF, CIV, CMR, COD, COG, COM, GIN, LBR, MLI, MOZ, NER, NGA, PNG, SDN, SEN, SLB, SLE, TCD, TLS, UGA} occupies the bottom position in the ranking (cf. Fig. 1  and Tables 4  and 5 ). Turning to the twelve regions, the average ranking let to the following order: OECD = HIC > UMIC > E_Euro_Asia > LAC > E_S_Asia = MENA > SID > LMIC = Oceania = Africa = LIC, respectively. In the case of region ranking the two most important indicators appears to be SDG 1 and SDG 5. Looking at the ranking of the trends Belarus and Croatia are found in the top whereas the bottom is occupied by Sudan and Chad. The trends of the regions disclosed that OECD = HIC > E_Euro_Asia > UMIC > E_S_Asia > LMIC > MENA > LAC > SIDS = Africa > Oceania. For the country trend ranking again SDGs 4 and 5 appear as the most important whereas for the region trend ranking SDG 1 is the overwhelming most important. The overall conclusion is that although several countries apparently are on track the majority of countries still have considerable challenges in order eventually to meet the goals included in the pillar people, i.e., SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 by the end of 2030.
