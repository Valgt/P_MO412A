                  Food, water and energy are essential to sustainable development and their security greatly affects the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs). This study analyzes the interactions among food system, water system and energy system in China based on SDG 2, SDG 6 and SDG 7, which is beneficial to promote coordinated development of resources and the attainment of SDGs at nation level. After establishing a comprehensive evaluation indicator system, the paper integrates the entropy method with the hierarchical analysis process to assign weight to indicators, and then uses the coupling coordination model to quantitatively evaluate the coordinated development level of SDG 2 on food system, SDG 6 on water system and SDG 7 on energy system. The results show that: (1) In general, the comprehensive evaluation index of 2010–2020 shows an increasing trend over time and the coupling degree maintains a high level. (2) The coupling coordination degree also maintains a good trend, and transitions from primary coordination to good coordination. (3) The development level of SDG 6 on water system and SDG 7 on energy system still lags behind that of SDG 2 on food system, therefore improving the utilization efficiency of water and energy contributes to promoting sustainable development.

Editor: Dr. Sandra Venghaus Food, water and energy are essential to sustainable development and their security greatly affects the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs). This study analyzes the interactions among food system, water system and energy system in China based on SDG 2, SDG 6 and SDG 7, which is beneficial to promote coordinated development of resources and the attainment of SDGs at nation level. After establishing a comprehensive evaluation indicator system, the paper integrates the entropy method with the hierarchical analysis process to assign weight to indicators, and then uses the coupling coordination model to quantitatively evaluate the coordinated development level of SDG 2 on food system, SDG 6 on water system and SDG 7 on energy system. The results show that: (1) In general, the comprehensive evaluation index of 2010–2020 shows an increasing trend over time and the coupling degree maintains a high level. (2) The coupling coordination degree also maintains a good trend, and transitions from primary coordination to good coordination. (3) The development level of SDG 6 on water system and SDG 7 on energy system still lags behind that of SDG 2 on food system, therefore improving the utilization efficiency of water and energy contributes to promoting sustainable development.   Keywords SDGs  Sustainable development  Foods  Water  Energy  Coupling and coordination  China    1 Introduction Food, water and energy are interlinked and inseparable resources (De Amorim et al., 2018 ). Their relationships among the three resources are close and complex: the production and consumption of food cannot be separated from the input of energy and water resources, the water resources cannot be utilized without the consumption of energy, and the production energy also requires the participation of food and water. In today's global context of continuous population growth, resource scarcity, environmental degradation and climate change, the coordinated development of food, water and energy systems is particularly important, and therefore exploring the interactions among them will be the focus of current research. They are important elements of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The United Nations proposed 17 SDGs and 169 targets, aiming to promote multidimensional balanced development and achieve sustainable development of human society (Desa et al., 2016 ). Besides, the indicator systems of 17 SDGs are important tools for measuring the development level of the targets (Division, 2022 ). SDG 2 consists of five targets ranging from the eradication of hunger and malnutrition to doubling the productivity of small-scale farmers and ensuring sustainable and resilient food production systems (Vogliano et al., 2021 ). SDG 2 aims to achieve zero hunger, and the key is to achieve food security and agricultural sustainability (Gil et al., 2019 ; Esfandabadi et al., 2022 ). SDG 6 is related to access to clean water and sanitation, and its targets all revolve around water security (Kh'ng et al., 2021 ; Nkiaka et al., 2021 ; Berger et al., 2021 ). SDG 7 aims to achieve reliable and clean energy, and all the targets are closely related to energy. Fader et al. (2018)  presented a quantitative approach to estimate the strength of potential trade-offs and synergies among food, water and energy using SDG 2, SDG 6 and SDG 7. As a globally recognized framework for sustainable development, SDGs cover multiple dimensions of sustainable development and can provide scientific guidance for the assessment of food-water-energy systems. In addition, exploring the relationship among food, water and energy provides insights for measuring the interactions of SDGs. In China, the three resources are potentially at risk, so their nexus deserves more attention and achieving coordination among these resources is particularly important for sustainable development (Han et al., 2020 ). The freshwater resources in China account for 6 % of the world's freshwater resources, and its per capita water resources are only 1/4 of the world average, making it one of the world's poorest countries in terms of per capita water resources. Water is mainly used in agriculture, industry, living and ecology, with agriculture and industry taking up the majority. According to the National Energy Administration statistics (LiuAihua, 2020 ), agricultural and industrial water use accounted for 61.5 % and 17.7 % of total water use, respectively in 2021. The spatial distribution of water, energy and food production is extremely uneven in China. Regionally, the distribution of freshwater resources is generally more in the south and less in the north, more in the southeast and less in the northwest, while the distribution of energy and food production is reversed (Abudukelimu, 2022 ). A growing economy and widespread urbanization have contributed to the continued growth of natural resource exploitation, putting increasing pressure on the sustainability of China's resources and environment. As a developing country with 18 % of the world's population, China has a huge demand for food, water and energy. Therefore, with the growing importance of the three, there is an urgent need for an in-depth study of their interactions to achieve coordinated development of resources. This study intends to conduct a comprehensive evaluation and coupling coordination development study on SDG 2 on food system, SDG 6 on water system and SDG 7 on energy system in China, exploring their coupling relationships and time-series changes. The study was expected to yield the following main contributions to the existing knowledge. Firstly, the study makes methodological contribution. We establish the evaluation indicator system for food, water and energy based on SDG 2, SDG 6 and SDG 7 respectively, which makes the comprehensive evaluation more scientific and consistent with the theme of sustainable development. Secondly, we introduce a new model to quantify the relationship between the goals, which can quantify the interactions of the three goals combined with regional status and enrich the research perspective of further quantifying the interactions of SDGs. Finally, our results contribute to the analysis of China's SDGs current development situation. The study of food, water and energy under the sustainable development goals framework provides theoretical support for the formulation and implementation of national sustainable development strategies and explores the optimal paths for the rational exploitation and utilization of food, water and energy. The rest parts are organized as follows. Section 2  reviews the studies on water-energy-food nexus and SDGs. Section 3  presents the steps of constructing comprehensive evaluation index and the coupling coordination model in detail. Section 4  analyzes the performance of evaluation and model. Section 5  concludes the paper and makes recommendations. Particularly, it is very critical to provide a global description of the notation used in this paper to enhance its readability, as shown in Table 1  .  2 Literature review At the Bonn 2011 Nexus Conference, Hoff (Hoffman, 2011 ) pointed out that food, energy and water are not isolated subsystems, but rather a system with complex interrelationships, and that a systematic and holistic view is needed for their study. Subsequently, the Water-Energy-Food (WEF) nexus has received attention from different institutions and organizations: The WEF Nexus in Asia and the Pacific released by the United Nations Economic and Social Council for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) in 2013 (Adnan, 2013 ) proposed that WEF is closely linked in time and space. From the perspective of water resources management, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) (Bank, 2013 ) proposed that due to the complexity of the WEF nexus, it is necessary to improve the level of water governance and change the extensive development and utilization of water resources. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in 2014 (FAO, 2022 ) analyzed how to adopt the WEF nexus approach to ensure food security and sustainable agricultural development. Meanwhile, some studies focused on reviewing the research methodologies of the WEF nexus, aiming to lay the foundation for subsequent studies (Islam et al., 2021 ; Ferroukhi et al., 2015 ; Semertzidis, 2015 ; Kaddoura and El Khatib, 2017 ; Endo et al., 2017 ; Dai et al., 2018 ). Some scholars mainly conducted empirical studies at different scales, analyzing WEF nexus with regional characteristics and making policy recommendations (Daher and Mohtar, 2015 ; Rasul, 2016 ; Gazal et al., 2022 ; Hailemariam et al., 2019 ; Marttunen et al., 2019 ). Quantifying the WEF nexus not only helps reduce trade-offs and promote synergies but also contributes to the security and utilization efficiency of resources (Endo et al., 2017 ). In these studies, input-output analysis (Daher and Mohtar, 2015 ; Liu et al., 2017 ), system dynamics models (Sahin et al., 2014 ; Tan and Yap, 2019 ), life cycle assessment (Al-Ansari et al., 2015 ; De Laurentiis et al., 2016 ) and integrated assessment models (Bazilian et al., 2011 ; Radmehr et al., 2021 ) have been used to quantify the WEF nexus. Generally speaking, studies related to the WEF nexus have concentrated on revealing the mutual feedback mechanisms among the three and exploring methods to simulate and analyze their linkages. Research on interactions among SDG 2 on food, SDG 6 on water and SDG 7 on energy in China can further explore the interactions among SDG 2, SDG 6 and SDG 7, achieving the promotion of synergies and the avoidance of trade-offs among goals. Since the SDGs were proposed, they have been comprehensively discussed and thoroughly studied by scholars. SDGs and their indicator systems can provide an integrated, comprehensive and authoritative assessment framework for sustainable assessment at different levels. Schmidt-Traub et al. (2017)  introduced the SDG Index and Dashboards as analytical tools for assessing countries' baselines. This tool synthesizes available country-level data for all 17 goals and estimates the gap toward achieving the SDGs for each country. Wei et al. (2022)  built an assessment framework based on 60 indicators from 17 goals to measure the development of China's Yangtze River Economic Zone and to identify the key factors affecting development, the results show that all regions in the Yangtze River Economic Zone face significant challenges in achieving SDGs. Given the broad scope of SDGs and the fact that the process of their realization is the result of a combination of various aspects, studying the influencing factors of SDGs helps to promote the achievement of the goals and avoid adverse effects. Rosati and Faria (2019)  examined the impacts of 27 institutional-related factors on SDGs using a sample of 2413 sustainability reports from 90 countries, which show that countries with higher levels of climate change vulnerability, national corporate social responsibility, company spending on tertiary education, indulgence and individualism, and lower levels of market coordination, employment protection, power distance and long-term orientation are more likely to actively implement SDGs. Consolandi et al. (2020)  analyzed the impact of PV on SDG 3 (healthy lives and well-being), SDG 4 (education) and SDG 7 (energy) in Tanzania by constructing an iSDG model and found that the investments in photovoltaics positively affect life expectancy, years of schooling and access to electricity, and the progress on these dimensions synergizes and leads to broader system-wide impacts. Moving closer toward achieving a goal can have a negative (trade-offs) or positive (synergies) impact on other goals, causing the existence of complex interaction among SDGs (Asadikia et al., 2021 ). While the progress of realizing goals has been made in some initial planning stages, key gaps remain in terms of the assessment of interlinkages, trade-offs and synergies between targets (Allen et al., 2018 ). Sorting out the relationships among SDGs and relying on SDGs to help decision-makers formulate strategies and policies for social, environmental and economic development to promote sustainable development with practical results, are major research priorities in this field. Network analysis and literature review have been widely used to map interactions of SDGs. All the goals and indicators can be viewed as a whole and used network analysis techniques to link them together based on the semantics (Le Blanc, 2015 ). Pradhan et al. (2017)  used official SDG indicator data from 277 countries to map the positive or negative correlations between a pair of SDG indicators. McCollum et al. (2018)  starting from the SDG 7 entry point, used the literature review to classify the relationship between SDG 7 and other SDGs into seven different types as a way to further measure the key energy-related interactions between SDGs and context-dependencies (relating to time, geography, governance, technology, and directionality). Hazarika and Jandl (2019)  combined literature survey with a structured questionnaire of the opinion leaders to assess the linkages of sustainable forest management strongly related to SDG 15 and other SDGs. Besides these, machine learning (Asadikia et al., 2021 ), multi-factor models (Mulligan et al., 2020 ) and multi-criteria decision analysis (Jayaraman et al., 2015 ) also were used to explore synergies and trade-offs among SDGs. The attainment of the SDG agenda will greatly depend on whether the identified synergies among the goals can be leveraged (Pradhan et al., 2017 ). Although previous studies have focused on the interactions and priorities among SDGs, the majority still use qualitative approaches. This paper attempts to use a quantitative model that can quantify interactions among some goals in a specific context, which allows decision-makers to prioritize key goals and rationalize resource allocation in the face of uncertainty. In this study, a coupling coordination model measuring SDG 2 on food, SDG 6 on water and SDG 7 on energy was constructed. Coupling refers to the phenomenon in which elements within or between systems affect each other through various interactions (Garcia and You, 2016 ), and coordination refers to a state or result of system evolution (Degefu et al., 2016 ). The coupling coordination model has been used in many research fields (Bazilian et al., 2011 ; Liu et al., 2005 ; Zhang et al., 2010 ; Liao, 1999 ) and can reflect the strength of the interaction between different systems and the coupling coordination level. Therefore, the coupling coordination model can well determine the interrelationship among these three goals. SDGs are more specific, extensive and comprehensive, and can provide a scientific and complete indicator system for building a comprehensive evaluation index of food-water-energy systems. This paper selects China as the study region and carries out specific quantification combined with its development level and current policies. The innovations of this paper are to construct a comprehensive evaluation index of food-water-energy using the indicator framework of SDG 2, SDG 6 and SDG 7, and to further interpret the interactions between SDG 2, SDG 6 and SDG 7 according to the assessment of the WEF nexus. Assessing the time-series changes in the coupling and coordination degree of the three goals is essential to promote the sustainability of the food, water and energy nexus and to establish a solid basis for the synergistic development of the different systems.  3 Method To study interactions among SDG 2, SDG 6 and SDG 7 and explore the food-water-energy nexus, the following steps are used in this paper: (1) Interpreting and clustering the targets and indicators of SDG 2, SDG 6 and SDG 7 respectively. (2) Modifying the indicator system. (3) Using the Entropy Method and Analytic Hierarchy Process to determine the indicators' weights and establishing a comprehensive assessment index. (4) Constructing a coupling coordination model of SDG 2 on food, SDG 6 on water and SDG 7 on energy. The flowchart for exploring the interactions is shown in Fig. 1  . It is worth noting that this paper analyzes the connotation of the targets at the national level, and the data utilized in the paper are from the China Statistical Yearbook (LiuAihua, 2020 ), China Agricultural Statistical Yearbook (Li, 2020 ), China Water Resources Bulletin (2022), and China Urban and Rural Construction Statistical Yearbook (Hu, 2020 ) for the 11 years during 2010–2020. 3.1 Interpreting targets and clustering indicators SDG2 aims to “end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture”, and the goals and targets in SDG2 emphasize three aspects of food security: increasing food production, improving food productivity, and stabilizing food prices. Targets 2.1 and 2.4 refer to the need to ensure food sufficiency and production, targets 2.3, 2.4, 2.a focus on increasing food productivity using various forms, and target 2.c is concerned with food price volatility. Increasing food production is the primary purpose of achieving food security and increasing food productivity and stabilizing food prices are important tools for achieving food security. SDG 6 is related to “ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all”. Three aspects of water are emphasized in SDG 6: ensuring water supply security, improving water efficiency, and improving water quality. Targets 6.1, 6.4, and 6.5 focus on water accessibility and security of water supply; targets 6.4, 6.a directly propose to improve water use efficiency; targets 6.3, 6.a, and 6.b emphasize realizing wastewater recycling and improving water quality from the aspects of reducing discharge, technical treatment and strengthening management. Ensuring the safety of supply is a prerequisite for sustainable water management while improving water use efficiency and water quality provides effective ways to achieve drinking water safety and sustainable water management. SDG 7 aims to “ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all”. SDG 7 emphasizes two aspects of energy: optimizing the energy mix and improving energy efficiency. Targets 7.1, 7.2, and 7.b focus on the structure of energy, with an emphasis on the share of clean energy. The other two targets emphasize energy efficiency in terms of primary energy, GDP, and technology. Achieving an increased share of renewable energy and improving energy efficiency are two important approaches to ensuring access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable modern energy for all.  3.2 Modifying the indicator system The United Nations has proposed corresponding targets and indicators for each goal, but not all of these indicators are clear and available for scientific research (Hák et al., 2016 ). In the process of connotation interpretation of the three goals, the following two problems were found: (1) The indicators do not reflect all contents of the targets well. For example, indicator 2.4.1 “proportion of agricultural area” can't be used to measure all contents mentioned in target 2.4. (2) Lack of convenient, reliable and unified data sources: the quantitative monitoring of SDGs requires a large amount of data, and the basic data of many indicators rely on social statistics or surveys, while the statistical data of different countries and regions have different statistical calibers and access, making it difficult to collect complete data of these indicators and to compare the calculated results. Indicators should be reflective of the goals and data should be readily available. This paper uses four ways to transform the indicators of three SDGs: (1) Adoption (A): without changing the name, definition and calculation method of the original indicator, it can be used directly. (2) Modification (M): The original indicator names, definitions, and calculation methods can be referred to, and need to use other indicators for substitution. (3) Extensions (E): supplement the indicators that cannot fully express the connotation of the target. (4) Not Applicable (NA): Indicators for which no study data are available or which are not relevant to the purpose of this study will be discarded. According to the above methods, eight subdimensions were extracted from SDG 2, SDG 6 and SDG 7, and 28 related indicators were obtained. Based on this, a comprehensive evaluation indicator system of SDG 2 on food system, SDG 6 on water system and SDG 7 on energy system in China was constructed, as shown in Table 2  .  3.3 Empowering and building comprehensive evaluation index (1) Standardization Since the original data have different dimensions and directions of effects, they are first standardized to make the values comparable between different indicators:(1) Positive indicators : X ij  = x ij  − min x ij    max x ij   − min x ij        (2) Negative indicators : X ij  = max x ij   − x ij   max x ij   − min x ij        where: X ij   is the standardized value of indicator j  in i -th year with the 2010 being the first year, x ij  : the initial value of indicator j  in i -th year with the 2010 being the first year, max (x ij  ) and min (x ij  ) are the maximum and minimum values of indicator j  during the n  years. (2) Empowerment The Entropy method. Entropy is a measure and description of data uncertainty. The greater the amount of information reflected in the data, the smaller the uncertainty, the smaller the entropy value, and vice versa (Chen et al., 2008 ). The Entropy Method determines the importance of indicators based on the variation degree of the data of each indicator and is a relatively objective method of assigning weight (Zhao, 1998 ). Indicator weights are determined according to the amount of information that each indicator can provide, and the greater the information entropy, the more important the role in the comprehensive evaluation, which is calculated as follows:(3) P ij  = X ij  ∑ i = 1  n  X ij       (4) e j  = − 1 ln n   ∑ i = 1  n  P ij  ln P ij     (5) g j  = 1 − e j     (6) w j 1   = g j  ∑ j = 1  m  g j       where: P ij  : the proportion of indicator values of indicator j  in i -th year, n :statistical year, e j  : information entropy of indicator j , and 0 ≤ e j   ≤ 1, when P ij   = 0, e j   = 0, g j  : variation coefficient of indicator j , w j 1 : weight of indicator j  under the entropy method; m : the amount of indicator of this system. The Analytic Hierarchy Process. The discriminant matrix was established, and the weights of each factor were calculated by asymptotic normalization coefficient and passed the consistency test (CR < 0.1) to obtain the weights of each indicator.(7) T j  = ∏ λ = 1  m  F λj   m  λ j = 1  2 ⋯ m     (8) w j 2   = T j  ∑ j = 1  m  T j       where: T j  : the m -th root of the product of elements of each row of the discriminant matrix, λ : indicator that belong to the same goal of indicator j  (λ  = 1, 2, ⋯, m ), F λj  : the comparison value of indicator j  and indicator λ , w j 2 : weight of indicator j  under analytic hierarchy process. The average value of the analytic hierarchy process and the entropy method is taken as the comprehensive weight (w j  ), as shown in Table 3  . The combination of objective and subjective methods to determine the weight can overcome the limitations of a single method so that the evaluation results are more objective and more scientific.(9) w j  = w j 1   + w j 2    2      (3) Comprehensive Evaluation Index T (10) f x  = ∑ j = 1  m  w j  X ij     (11) g y  = ∑ j = 1  m  w j  X ij     (12) h z  = ∑ j = 1  m  w j  X ij     (13) T = af x  + bg y  + ch z     where: T  (Zheng, 2017 ): comprehensive evaluation index of the three goals as a whole; f (x ), g (y ), h (z ) are the evaluation indices of SDG 2 on food system, SDG 6 on water system and SDG 7 system, respectively; a , b , c  are the weights of each goal. The 17 goals set by the United Nations are of equal importance to each other (van Leeuwen, 2017 ), so SDG 2, SDG 6 and SDG 7 are of equal importance to each other, a  = b  = c  = 1/3.  3.4 Establishing coupling coordination model Based on the related study (Liao, 1999 ) and other scholars constructed the coupling model:(14) C n  = n u 1  u 2  ⋯ u m    ∏ u i  + u j       1 n   , i , j = 1 , 2 , ⋯ m     Combining with this paper, three objectives are involved, SDG 2 (food system), SDG 6 (water system) and SDG 7 (energy system), so the coupling model of this paper is(15) C = 3 f x  g y  h z   3   f x  + g y  + h z        C  is coupling degree and can reflect the interaction of different systems and the degree of interaction. 0 ≤ C  ≤ 1, the larger the value is, the higher the coordinated level of the systems is. When C  = 1, it indicates that the systems are in the best coordination state. The coupling coordination model (Ka et al., 2015 ) can better reflect the coordination development level of systems:(16) D = C × T       D  is coupling coordination degree. According to the relevant literature (Liao, 1999 ), this paper divided the coupling coordination extent into different levels, as shown in Table 4  .   4 Results 4.1 The time series variation characteristics of the comprehensive evaluation index As can be seen from Table 5  , the comprehensive evaluation index of SDG 2 on food system, SDG 6 on water system and SDG 7 on energy system in China from 2010 to 2020 is in a volatile upward period over 11 years, mainly due to the rapid development of the water resources system and the instability in energy system and food system. The evaluation index of SDG 2 on food system in general shows an upward trend, developing faster and without significant fluctuations during this 11-year period, which is consistent with the current agricultural development trend in China, as shown in Fig. 2  . Since the abolition of agricultural taxes, the country has strengthened support for agriculture and significantly improved agricultural infrastructures, which bring a 14.6 % increase in effective irrigated areas. After the implementation of the grain production subsidy and temporary storage system, farmers' income and enthusiasm for growing grain increased significantly, and grain output increased by about 20 percentage points in the 11 years. Meanwhile, a 14.7 % increase in fertilizer application with the greatest weight, and a 13.8 % increase in total agricultural machinery power, also greatly contribute to increase the unit area yield of grain and grain productivity. The evaluation index of SDG 6 on water resources system has fluctuated significantly. During this period, the water consumption structure has been improved, of which agricultural water consumption still accounts for the largest proportion, accounting for >60 %, the proportion of industrial water consumption has been decreasing year by year, and the proportion of ecological water consumption has increased significantly. The water consumption per unit of GDP dropped by 50 percentage points, and the improvement in wastewater treatment rate was obvious, which is closely related to the national policy of optimizing the industrial structure and focusing on environmental protection. The 8.5 % decline in per capita water consumption during this period also caused fluctuations in the overall evaluation index. The change of evaluation index in SDG 7 on energy system was modest, basically remaining between 0.52 and 0.31, but maintained an upward trend during the 11 years. The decline of the evaluation index in 2011 was mainly due to a 12 % year-on-year increase in per capita electricity consumption, which has significant negative pulling impacts. Since then, due to the rapid development of the national economy, total energy production increased by 16 %, and the structure of energy consumption also changed accordingly, with energy consumption per unit of GDP reduced by 18 %. But at the same time, the largest weight per capita energy consumption increased by 17.4 %. In 2017, the energy system showed a decline. The reasons were firstly due to the decline in coal production caused by the supply-side reform to eliminate excess capacity and the national adjustment of energy consumption variety structure. In addition, energy consumption increased with economic development, which led to a significant deterioration of the energy supply and demand relationship. In addition, the elasticity coefficient of energy consumption has rebounded from its low point in 2015, but it is still in a state of intensive development. In short, the food, water and energy separately based on SDG 2, SDG 6 and SDG 7 in China are lagging energy resources, of which the food subsystem is the most stable and improved, the water system is the second most stable, and the energy subsystem is the least stable. All systems have gained development from 2010 to 2020, largely as a result of a combination of economic development and government policy support. The optimization of industrial structure has led to improvements in the structure of water and energy consumption, and the decline in the proportion of resource-based industries has led to a decrease in the unit GDP. The support policies for agriculture from the government are the main reason for the development of the food system. The indicators that have a significant negative impact on the three goals are water consumption per capita, electricity consumption per capita and fertilizer application. Electricity consumption and fertilizer application indicate that economic and social development has become more dependent on resources and destructive to the environment.  4.2 The time series variation characteristics of coupling coordination level As shown in Fig. 3  , the coupling degrees of SDG 2 (food system), SDG 6(water system) and SDG7 (energy system) fluctuate between 0.95 and 1.00 during 2010–2020, and the overall coupling degree is high, indicating that the interaction between the three goals is very significant. Meanwhile, the coupling coordination degree of SDGs increases from 0.559 in 2012 to 0.819 in 2020. After 2012, the coupling coordination degree shows an increasing trend, from primary coordination type to good coordination type gradually. Since the coupling degree of the three goals is close to 1, which means they are relatively stable, the changing trend of coupling coordination degree is similar to the comprehensive evaluation index, which is in a fluctuating upward trend. The fluctuations are mainly caused by the fluctuation of SDG 6 on water system and SDG 7 on energy system, and the driving factors are mainly the optimization of water consumption structure, the improvement of industrial sewage treatment rate and the change of energy consumption structure, which are caused by the national adjustment of industrial structure.  4.3 Comparative relationship analysis of SDG 2, SDG 6 and SDG 7 The SDGs are not independent of each other, and there is a complex dynamic relationship among them. Changes in any two goals will have impacts on another, which may accelerate or hinder the attainment of this goal. In the process of countries' efforts to achieve the SDGs, the SDGs may be synergistic or antagonistic to each other. Under the influence of various external factors, the impacts among the goals occur in the form of complex networks and have implications for the entire socioeconomic and environmental system. To further analyze the relationship between the three goals, the evaluation value of each goal is compared between the two and the comparison coefficient is calculated.(17) l SDG 6 , SDG 2   = g x   f y       (18) l SDG 6 , SDG 7   = g x   h z       (19) l SDG 7 , SDG 2   = h y   f z        The comparison coefficients between different targets were divided into different types of relationships (Ka et al., 2015 ) l  ≤ 0.6, extremely hand-impaired type; 0.6 < l  ≤ 0.8, severely impaired type; 0.8 < l  ≤ 1.0, more shortage type; 1.0 < l  ≤ 1.5, more adequate type; 1.5 < l , especially adequate type. According to the above formula, the comparison coefficients between two pairs of SDG 2, SDG 6 and SDG 7 were calculated as shown in Fig. 4  . The comparison coefficients between the evaluation indices of SDG 2 and SDG6 show that l SDG 6, SDG 2  is <1 during 2014–2020, reaching a minimum value of 0.70 in 2018 and belongings to severely impaired type of SDG 6 on water system. When the development of SDG 2 is in a particularly adequate period compared to the development of regional SDG6, mainly due to the relatively sloppy use of water resources and low utilization efficiency. Around 2013, l SDG 6, SDG 2  fluctuates around 1.0, indicating a relatively balanced development between SDG 2 and SDG 6 in China. The comparison coefficients of SDG 6 and SDG 7 show that l SDG 6, SDG 7  is basically >1.0 during 2010–2020, indicating that regional energy development lags behind water development and utilization during this period, meaning that SDG 6 on water system is better developed than SDG 7 on energy system. The comparison coefficients between SDG 7 and SDG 2 show that from 2011 to 2020, the value of l SDG 7, SDG 2  is <1 and has a decreasing trend, indicating that the development of the food system is better and the food production is sufficient during the period. In 2020, the l SDG 7, SDG 2  values declined to 0.63, at which time the development of SDG6 was of the severely impaired type, mainly due to the low exploitation of regional water resources. The conflicts within the three SDGs are obvious and mainly exist between SDG2 (food system) and SDG 7(energy systems) and between SDG 6(water systems) and SDG7(energy system), which have a lot to do with the traditional resource-driven development approach and the segmented governance mechanism. Both food production and water utilization cannot be achieved without energy consumption. While ensuring food security and water security, it is crucial to focus on the rational utilization and development of energy for achieving long-term sustainable development. In short, the SDGs, as an indivisible whole, must minimize the negative impacts on other goals in the process of trying to achieve each goal.   5 Conclusions Achieving SDGs is a scientific guide for countries to pursue sustainable development, but there are complex interactions among the goals that may produce opposite results. The paper, using the comprehensive evaluation index and coupling coordination model, analyzes and explains the interaction between SDG 2 on food system, SDG 6 on water system and SDG 7 on energy system during 2010–2020 in China, and then, the coupling degree and the coordination development level among SDG 2, SDG 6 and SDG 7 at the national level are studied. The conclusions are as follows: (1) During the 11 years, the comprehensive evaluation index among SDG 2 on food system, SDG 6 on water system and SDG 7 on energy system increased by 175 %, and the coupling coordination degree increased from 0.61 to 0.82, showing a stable development in general. However, there are significant differences among them, which belong to the energy resource lagging type. Due to the policy support, the food system develops fastest and has the best stability. The energy system develops more slowly, and the energy mix needs to be further optimized. The water system fluctuates more, and the support capacity of the energy and food systems from the water system is fragile, which is not conducive to regional sustainable development. It can be seen that there are some differences between the development status of three systems under SDG 2, SDG 6 and SDG 7 from their respective evaluation indexes, therefore it is beneficial to maintain the overall coordinated development of the goals by improving their respective development levels. (2) The coupling analysis shows that the coupling degree among SDG 2 on food system, SDG 6 on water system and SDG 7 on energy system remains at a high level of coupling, indicating that there is an intrinsic connection and interaction among the three goals. In the process of vigorously promoting the realization of the goals, it is necessary to further improve coupled and coordinated development levels among the goals, which is of great social significance in guiding the integrated management of regional resources and promoting their sustainable development. (3) The internal conflicts of SDG 2 on food system, SDG 6 on water system and SDG 7 on energy system are more prominent, mainly occurring between food system and energy system and between water system and energy system, which are greatly related to the traditional resource-driven development approach and segmented governance mechanism. The sustainable development of food, water and energy should minimize the negative impact on other systems. Both food security and water security are inseparable from the utilization of energy, so more attention should be paid to the use efficiency of energy and structure optimization. Based on the above findings, to promote the sustainable development of resources and maximize synergies among SDG 2, SDG 6 and SDG 7 while achieving the goals, the following recommendations are made:(1) From the current situation, the development level of water and energy resources lags behind that of food production in China, and forms of resource utilization should be changed from a rough development model to a conservation and intensification model, adjusting the industrial structure, optimizing the functional layout, and enhancing the new industrialization process.  (2) The relationships of food, water and energy need to be further improved on the basis of maintaining food security, water security and energy security. It is necessary to ensure the coupled and coordinated development of the WEF system while maintaining rapid economic development, so as to promote regional sustainable development. Decision-makers should pay attention to the reasonable development and protection of water and energy resources while ensuring food security so that they can provide long-term and stable support for economic and social development.  (3) To improve the relationship between food and energy and between water and energy, the government should optimize the structure of energy production and increase the research and development investment in renewable energy. Then, improving the structure of energy consumption, accelerating the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries, promoting the development of high-tech industries and modern service industries, reducing the proportion of energy consumption in heavy industries, and at the same time focusing on reducing the environmental damage caused by energy use.    In this paper, the findings are of practical value and can provide some direction for developing resource coordination policies to alleviate resource conflicts in terms of food, water and energy based on SDG 2, SDG 6 and SDG 7. Meanwhile, it enriches the quantitative studies of interaction among SDGs and provides ideas for prioritizing the goals. By considering the interaction mechanisms, it can provide references and a planning basis for China to achieve the SDGs by 2030. The interactions among other SDGs can be further quantitatively studied, in addition, the study area can be extended to the global level.
