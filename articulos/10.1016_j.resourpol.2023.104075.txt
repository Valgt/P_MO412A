                  The persistent challenge in sustainable development is understanding the correlation between renewable energy consumption and natural resource rents, especially in the context of global economic growth. Existing literature has shed light on the aspects of resource growth and emissions, but the precise relationship between resource rents and renewable energy remains unexplored. This study analyzes global data from 1988 to 2021 using different time series econometric techniques to investigate this relationship. This study analysis reveals a long-term co-integration between renewable energy consumption and variables such as GDP, mineral rents, oil rents, and natural gas rents. The empirical results demonstrate a favorable and statistically significant relationship between economic growth and renewable energy consumption. Moreover, the results indicate that while natural gas and mineral rents negatively affect the sustainability of renewable energy, oil rents appear to have a positive effect on renewable energy consumption. These findings are significant as they suggest that a strategic realignment of how we approach and manage natural resource revenues is required to fully exploit the potential of renewable energy in fostering economic growth and preserving natural resources.

The persistent challenge in sustainable development is understanding the correlation between renewable energy consumption and natural resource rents, especially in the context of global economic growth. Existing literature has shed light on the aspects of resource growth and emissions, but the precise relationship between resource rents and renewable energy remains unexplored. This study analyzes global data from 1988 to 2021 using different time series econometric techniques to investigate this relationship. This study analysis reveals a long-term co-integration between renewable energy consumption and variables such as GDP, mineral rents, oil rents, and natural gas rents. The empirical results demonstrate a favorable and statistically significant relationship between economic growth and renewable energy consumption. Moreover, the results indicate that while natural gas and mineral rents negatively affect the sustainability of renewable energy, oil rents appear to have a positive effect on renewable energy consumption. These findings are significant as they suggest that a strategic realignment of how we approach and manage natural resource revenues is required to fully exploit the potential of renewable energy in fostering economic growth and preserving natural resources.

In the wake of climate change considerations and the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an augmented global emphasis on the sustainable management of natural resources. This focus was further underscored during the recent Conference of Parties 26 and 27, where the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12 was prominently highlighted, advocating for the responsible consumption and conservation of natural resources on a global scale (Li et al., 2023 ). The resource-growth and resource-emissions nexus has been extensively discussed globally because natural resources benefit the economy and have actions for environmental sustainability (Li et al., 2021 ; Umar et al., 2022 ; Yang et al., 2021 ). The outcomes in the extant literature strips are either conflated or have asymmetric associations. However, due to the recent upgrades, renewable energy (RE) and natural resource rents have been spotlighted due to increased sustainability and green economic perspectives (Hayat et al., 2023 ; Li et al., 2023 ). Several studies are available on promoting RE and natural resources sustainability, but the linkages provided are ambiguous and therefore need more exploration and attention. Moreover, the recent increasing threats of climate change before and after the Covid-19 pandemic has forced countries and world leaders to use pro-environmental technologies, conservation of natural resources, and climate-friendly consumption of energies. Natural resources are focused on the last few decades and their sustainability which can spur the promotion of climate-friendly technologies to protect against the global environment and climate changes. Fig. 1   represents global trends in coal, natural gas, and mineral rents. Renewable energy (RE) is one of its main components, which can provide an energy mix and promotes a balance of energy required for the global economy needs (Chen et al., 2023 ; Ji et al., 2021a,b ). Researchers believe RE will transform the energy demand for economic growth by two third in 2050. RE has become the key factor globally, and its quest to achieve such demands has remained in question due to the unsustainable use of natural resources. Resource-renewable energy is getting attention due to its importance and connection with each other (Cao and Xiang, 2023 ; Li et al., 2023 ). Therefore, this research aims to examine the global interconnection between natural resource rents and renewable energy (RE) consumption. This analysis seeks to answer the critical question of whether the sustainable use of natural resources can stimulate the growth of renewable energy. The study also looks at how GDP growth correlates with renewable energy usage, arguing that a booming economy can help speed up the world’s transition to RE sources. Many developed countries have robust financial systems generating funds and investments for sectors like green infrastructures and renewable product systems, contributing significantly to a transition from non-renewable to RE economies (Chen et al., 2022b ; Naqvi et al., 2023 ; Rizvi et al., 2022 ). Sustainable economic growth alleviates the strain on non-RE sources, enabling a shift to RE consumption, as seen in countries such as Norway and Austria (Koseoglu et al., 2022 ; Ramzan et al., 2023 ). The study aims to shed light on the complex interplay between natural resource rents, RE, and economic growth. This study is primarily motivated by the need to understand the significance of natural resources in promoting RE globally. Its distinctive contributions are multi-dimensional. It investigates a relatively unexplored global connection between renewable energy (RE) usage and rents from natural resources like minerals, oil rents, and natural gas. Second, this study provides a fresh perspective using several time series methods to investigate structural breaks due to the Covid-19 epidemic. In addition, the study encompasses data from 33 years, from 1988 to 2021, which increases the significance and understanding of its findings. For long-term co-integration, analytical techniques such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test and the Bayer-Hanck model are used to identify the unit root in the data. In contrast, ARDL and Quantile regression are used for primary estimations, supplemented by secondary diagnostics and stability tests. For Robustness check analyses, this study employed FMOLS, DOLS, CCR, and Robust least squares to ensure the validity of the findings. The inclusion of economic growth as a control variable helps to contextualize the data in a significant way. This study aims to fill a significant gap in the literature by providing valuable insights for policymakers, and researchers interested in the connection of natural resource rents, renewable energy, and economic growth, thereby advancing our collective understanding of these crucial global issues. After the introduction, the rest of the study is designed in the following ways. Section 2  evaluates the literature presented in the study. Section 3  designs the theoretical framework, model specification, and estimation techniques. Section 4  describes the results and discussion, and Section 5  draws conclusions and policy implications of the study.  2 Literature review Renewed energy (RE) production is rising worldwide due to sustainable resource utilization and consistent economic expansion. Such studies existed in the previous literature but have different or conflated outcomes. Henceforth, these studies are examined for the current study’s understanding. The literature is divided into two dynamics. The first discusses economic growth and RE consumption, while the second focuses on the nexus of natural resources and RE consumption. 2.1 Nexus of natural resource rents and renewable energy (RE) consumption Previous studies have examined natural resources differently concerning many influential factors in the country, such as carbon emissions, economic performance, and financial development. However, the RE and natural resources nexus is discussed little in the previous literature. We include studies in this literature that are most relevant to the nexus and try to discover the crux of the issue. In one of the recent studies, Azam et al. (2023)  analyzed the natural resources synergy and its impact on RE consumption. The study also included economic growth, financial development, and gross capital formation as controlling variables from 1990 to 2017 in 30 developing countries. The results indicate that natural resources create synergy and increase RE consumption in these economies and have also found feedback effects through short- and long-term causality tests. Ahmadov and van der Borg (2019)  analyzed natural resources' role in RE production in EU economies from 1997 to 2015. The study included comparative analysis and other econometric techniques based on the panel data. The results reveal that natural resources are better and enhance RE consumption and production in EU economies. However, petroleum or oil rents have detrimental effects on RE production. Yang and Song (2023)  analyzed natural resources as a determinant of RE in OECD economies from 2000 to 2019. Their study employed several econometric panel data methods to show that RE (RE) sources are rising due to more efficient usage of natural resources. Chishti and Dogan (2022)  proposes determinants of RE by employing panel data methods in the top 10 RE economies. The results are affirmative and show an increasing pattern in RE due to natural resource endowments in the economy. Shinwari et al. (2022)  studied Chinese investment in renewables from 1990 to 2020 using time series data and several different econometric techniques. The control variables included economic growth, technical innovation, and energy efficiency. The findings show that the volatility of natural resources raises uncertainty about the future consumption of sustainable RE. Also, they showed a unidirectional causality, meaning that shifts in natural resource policies significantly affect RE investment. Zafar et al. (2021)  employed time series analysis to examine the relationship between Asian economies' reliance on RE, the availability of natural resources, and environmental sustainability from 1990 to 2018. The findings show that natural resources negatively impact carbon emissions, dismissing the significance of RE.  2.2 Nexus of economic growth and renewable energy (RE) consumption Since RE is the way of the future, Iqbal et al. (2023)  investigated the influence of GDP, CO2 emissions, and financial development on RE consumption in Pakistan. The authors included various time series methods, which include ARDL and NARDL, and the remaining basic approaches. The findings show that all the factors, including GDP, CO2 emissions, and financial development, enhance RE consumption in the short and long run. The results show an asymmetrical behaviour indicating constant production, while positive changes in the preceding factors result in noticeable shifts in RE. Yang and Song (2023)  examined the role of macroeconomic factors, which includes human development, technological advancements, and industrialization, on the RE of OECD economies from 2000 to 2019. The results indicate that foreign direct investment and urbanization will harm OECD economies' RE and energy efficiency. In contrast, higher GDP per capita and improvements in human capital will have a beneficial impact. Alola et al. (2023)  scrutinized the effects of energy efficiency, research and development, economic development, and energy intensity on RE development of the top 12 energy security economies from 1990 to 2019. The data shows that energy efficiency, energy intensity, and R&D each have different impact in each economy. However, panel analysis suggests that GDP and the remaining three variables significantly increase RE development and consumption in the top 12 RE economies. Samour et al. (2022)  analyzed the impact of economic expansion, FDI, and financial development on RE in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from 1989 to 2019. Time series econometric methods like Bootstrap Auto Regressive Distributed Lags and Granger causality approaches are included in the study. The research shows that the country’s short-term and long-term dynamics of RE consumption benefit greatly from economic expansion, financial development, and FDI. Chishti and Dogan (2022)  analyzed the role of Information and communication technology, macroeconomic uncertainty, economic growth, human development, and globalization’s effect on RE consumption in the top 10 renewable consumption economies from 1990 to 2017. The results observed that ICT enhances RE consumption while the remaining variables have an asymmetric relationship with RE consumption in the top 10 economies. Somoye et al. (2022)  probed the determinants of RE consumption in Nigeria from 1960 to 2019. The authors used Parameterization ARDL in the error correction approach. The findings reveal that economic growth and financial development increases in RE consumption while fossil fuels reduce or harm the development of RE in Nigeria for short- and long-term measurements. Shahbaz et al. (2022)  studied China’s RE consumption from 1980 to 2019 with a focus on the impact of fiscal decentralization. Economic growth and income inequality are also included as control variables. The authors conducted their analysis using several time series techniques. The findings showed that income disparity in China affects RE usage, whereas fiscal decentralization and economic growth considerably boost RE consumption. Khezri et al. (2022)  examined various factors, which include several macroeconomic factors such as technological development, human development index, population growth, and research and development on RE development in ASEAN economies from 2000 to 2018. The findings show that technological progress has little bearing on RE sources, but increasing populations and energy demands necessitate their implementation in ASEAN nations. It is evident from the above literature review that studies have shown contradictory results on the relationship between natural resources and RE consumption. Therefore, this study is the first of its kind to evaluate the role of sustainable use of natural resources in economic growth on a global scale. There is a lack of research examining this nexus, especially within the framework of sustainable development goals and, more importantly, in the context of contemporary climate change and global warming challenges, as highlighted by the recent COP26 and COP27 conferences. The effect of natural resources on RE consumption remains largely unexplored and raises critical questions. Hence, this research seeks to analyze the interplay between natural resources and RE while also incorporating the element of economic growth to fill this significant gap in the literature.   3 Theoretical framework, model specification, and estimation techniques This study examines the interplay between RE and natural resources by including economic expansion in the model. Utilizing RE aids the economy is improving the adverse effects of carbon emissions and environmental deterioration. Across the globe, RE has become a major instrument for eco-friendly development and innovation. To spur RE in the country, sustainable economic growth and natural resources are pre-requisite to the replenishable energy sector. Natural resources in the growing literature have negative effects because of their rents, which are focused on the sectors that do not generate enough revenue. Moreover, when used excessively, natural resources lose their sustainability and cause environmental degradation. Because of this, natural resources have a predominantly negative impact on developing economies (Ahmadov and Van Der Borg, 2019 ; Azam et al., 2023 ; Liu et al., 2023 ; Zafar et al., 2021 ). Minerals, such as those used in the production of lithium batteries and cobalt, underscore how nature can be instrumental to the RE sector. In addition, RE growth in the long term is consistent and leads to substantial economic benefits. Sustainable economic growth depends on RE products and efficient natural resources. In contrast, during periods of unsustainable economic growth, there is a heavy reliance on non-renewable energy sources such as fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas rents), which in turn negatively impacts various economic factors and indicators (Khan et al., 2022a ; Li et al., 2023 ; Safi et al., 2023 ). It is discernible that steady economic growth will be ensured when the energy is efficient, environment-friendly, and abundant. Such practices will increase economic growth, further enhancing the relevant factors associated with it (Li et al., 2023 ; Zhou et al., 2021 ). Hence, factors that support economic growth and are sustainable economic growth will have a positive impact on RE consumption. 3.1 Model specification The proposed research framework for this study is based on the theoretical foundations presented earlier, is aligned with its stated objectives, and is based on a comprehensive literature review.(1) R E C  t  = f ( G D P  t  , M N R N T  t  , O R N T S  t  , N G R N T S  t   )       The econometric model provided for the study is following:(2) R E C  t  = α 1  + β 1  G D P  t  + β 2  M N R N T  t  + β 3  O R N T S  t  + β 4  N G R N T S  t  + φ t       Equation (2)  specifies that the dependent variable is renewable energy consumption (REC), measured as renewable energy out of total final energy consumption. Moreover, the independent variables include the natural resources rents, which include MNRNT, ORNTS, and NGRNT, mineral rents, oil rents, and natural gas rents; all these components are measured as a percentage of GDP. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the second independent variable, a measure for economic growth, expressed in 2015 US constant dollars. The “t   ” in the study’s subscript denotes the time series data approach, while the “φ   ” represents the model’s error term. The regression line’s intercept and slope are denoted by the symbols ″ α  a n d  β ″   . The data for this study was collected over a span of 34 years, from 1988 to 2021. The modeled variables data have been collected from the indicators of the World Bank (World Bank, 2023 ).  3.2 Estimation procedures 3.2.1 Unit root test (ADF with structural breaks) This study presents employed Augmented Dickey-Fuller test (Dickey & Fuller, 1981 ) analysis with structural breaks as a first analysis for assessing time series data. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test (Dickey & Fuller, 1981 ) is utilized when the data exhibit trends or seasonal fluctuations that render the mean and standard deviation non-static. This test identifies the data’s unit root by evaluating its stationarity and integrating various lags and leads. The study also applied various important structural breaks in the data due to global shocks or events. The equation for ADF is given below:(3) Δ Z E X  t  = β 1 + β 2 t + β 3 Z E X  t − 1   + ∑ i = 1  m  α i   Z E X  t − i   + ε t        3.2.2 Bayer-Hanck Co-integration test The Bayer-Hanck Co-integration test (Bayer and Hanck, 2013 ) was used to ascertain whether or not the dependent and independent variables are co-integrated in the long run after assessing the unit root properties of the data. The test is efficient and most relevant to the previous Engle-Granger co-integration test. It combines small tests such as (Banerjee et al., 1998 ) (BA), (Johansen, 1991 ) (J), (Engle & Granger, 1987 ) (EG), (Boswijk, 1994 ) (BO) and includes fisher-statistics with it to find out the co-integration. The data exhibit long-term co-integration when the crucial values are less than the Fisher-Statistics. For the antecedent test, we get the following equations:(4) E G − J = − 2 [ I n ( S E G   )  + I n  ( S J  )   ]      (5) E G − J − B O − B A = − 2 [ I n ( S E G   )  + I n  ( S J  )  + I n  ( S B A   )  + I n  ( S B O   )   ]        3.2.3 Simple quantile regression Simple quantile regression (Koenker, 2005 ) determines the distribution of the response variable percentile or quantile via explanatory variables and also follows the assumptions of the non-linear equation. Quantile regression is better than the simple ordinary least squares, which follow linearity as its first assumption in the data. Quantile regression helps us to identify the distribution of data by categorization, which teaches us to determine the effect of the explanatory variables at different quantiles, including the median, and not just one condition means. The equation for the quantile regression is as follows:(6) Q Y i   ( τ K  | α t  , X  t   )  = α t  + R t ′  β ( τ K  )       In the above equation (6) , the right side Q Y i   ( τ K  | α t  , X  t   )     of the quantile generates the methods for determining the dependent variable and its quantiles, where X t     specifies the independent variables included in the study. “α   ” is the individual parameters in the study, whereas “β   ” shows the slope of the coefficient. The symbol “τ   ” indicates the quantile index.  3.2.4 ARDL estimation This study also applies Auto Regressive Distributed Lag model (ARDL) for short- and long-term results. The study will analyze the data first in quantile regression which will categorize the different quantiles of the data for explanatory variables. Then the short- and long-term dynamics will be discussed via ARDL estimations. ARDL (Pesaran et al., 2001 ) is used in the study for many advantages the method has in the study. The study bound test is beneficial for the structural breaks taken because it determines its reliability and accuracy of existence in the time series data. ARDL works in both orders of stationarity in the data, whether the data is stationary or not. Moreover, ARDL can easily work on any country or economic zone sample data and determine explanatory variables' short- and long-run relationships with the dependent variables. The equation for the ARDL method is given below, where it is specified based on the Archaic model selection criteria. We have opted for this approach, and the equation displays the individual lags assigned to each modeled variable. The lags are REC = 2, GDP = 4, MRNT = 1, NGRNT = 4, ORNTS = 4. The equation is as follows:(7) Δ I n R E C  t  = β 0  + ∑ i = 1  p  β 1  Δ I n R E C  t − 1     + ∑ i = 1  p  β 2  Δ I n R E C  t − 2     + ∑ i = 1  p  β 3  Δ I n G D P  t − i     ± + ∑ i = 1  p  β 4  Δ I n G D P  t − 1     + ∑ i = 1  p  β 5  Δ I n G D P  t − 2     + ∑ i = 1  p  β 6  Δ I n G D P  t − 3     + ∑ i = 1  p  β 7  Δ I n G D P  t − 3     + ∑ i = 1  p  β 8  Δ I n G D P  t − 3     + ∑ i = 1  p  β 9  Δ I n G D P  t − 4     + ∑ i = 1  p  β 10  Δ I n M R N T  t − i     + ∑ i = 1  p  β 11  Δ I n M R N T  t − 1     + ∑ i = 1  p  β 12  Δ I n N G R N T  t − i     + ∑ i = 1  p  β 13  Δ I n N G R N T  t − 1     + ∑ i = 1  p  β 14  Δ I n N G R N T  t − 2     + ∑ i = 1  p  β 15  Δ I n N G R N T  t − 3     + ∑ i = 1  p  β 16  Δ I n N G R N T  t − 4     + ∑ i = 1  p  β 17  Δ I n O R N T S  t − i     + ∑ i = 1  p  β 18  Δ I n O R N T S  t − 1     + ∑ i = 1  p  β 19  Δ I n O R N T S  t − 2     + ∑ i = 1  p  β 20  Δ I n O R N T S  t − 3     + ∑ i = 1  p  β 21  Δ I n O R N T S  t − 4     + λ 1  I n R E C  t  + λ 2  I n G D P  t  + λ 3  I n M R N T  t  + λ 4  I n N G R N T  t  + λ 5  I n O R N T S  t  + ε t       The sign “Δ” represents the variations in the model while ε t     represents the residual or error term in the model. Moreover, ARDL bound estimates also posit a way for joint F-statistics co-integration hypothesis in the study, which reveals that when the F-Joint statistics or Wald statistics is higher than the lower bound estimates and lower than the upper bound estimates, we found that co-integration exists among variables and the null hypothesis, i.e., λ 1     = λ 2  = λ 3  = λ 4  = λ 5  = λ 6     = 0, rejected at the same time. The equation for the long and short-term ARDL bound estimates are given below, where the long-term estimations are differentiated via the sign “θ t    ” in the equation.  3.2.5 Diagnostics test The study applied diagnostics tests that determine the study’s auto-correlation or serial correlation and heteroskedasticity. For this purpose, Breusch-Godfrey Serial Correlation LM and Breusch-Pagan-Godfrey (also called the Breusch-Pagan test) are used to diagnose the model of any evidence serial correlation and heteroskedasticity. The model stability test is also applied: CUSUM (Cumulative Sum) and CUSUM Squares (Cumulative Sum of Squares). The model is stable when the critical values of the two tests are in line with the model (Umar et al., 2020 ).  3.2.6 Robustness analysis It is essential to validate the robustness of the study’s primary methodologies to ensure the accuracy of the estimates derived from these methods. This can be accomplished using diagnostic tests and relevant time series methods, such as FMOLS and DOLS. For this purpose, we utilized the methods which are fully modified OLS (Phillips & Hansen, 1990 ), Dynamic OLS (Stock & Watson, 1993 ), Canonical co-integration regression (Park, 1992 ), and Robust least squares. The first three methods check the data for serial correlation issues, endogeneity, heteroskedasticity, and possible short- and long-term co-integration. However, the robust least squares examine outliers and influential observations that exist in the data.    4 Results and discussion Table 1   provides an overview of the study’s variables before conducting a detailed analysis. Modeled variables are accompanied by their descriptive statistics. The mean, median, maximum, and minimum values of all the variables show an increase, indicating that they are all rising. Maximum and average values for all variables are highest for RE and minimum for mineral rentals. Standard deviation (SD) values are near the mean, indicating reduced volatility in the range values of the data, as reviewed in the study of the data’s volatility. Furthermore, skewness and kurtosis are used to examine the data distribution. All variables, except for RE, are favorably skewed, as shown by the skewness test analysis. In contrast, the kurtosis indicates that all variables, except mineral rents, have positive normal tail distributions to the right. We used the Jarque and Bera (1987)  test to check the data normality. Results show that the JB values of all factors are significant except for mineral rents, suggesting that not all variables follow a normal distribution. We, therefore, adopt the alternative hypothesis that the data is not normally distributed and has non-linearity features, rejecting the null hypothesis of data normality. Table 2   represents a pairwise correlation matrix of variables in the study. The results indicate that RE negatively correlates with GDP, mineral, oil, and natural gas rents. Mineral, oil, and natural gas rents, however, are correlated with economic expansion. Mineral rent is also positively correlated with oil and natural gas rents, whereas oil rents are positively correlated with natural gas rents. Concerning the stationarity process of the variables, Table 3   indicates the ADF unit root results with structural breaks taken from 1999, 2004, 2007, 2014, 2017, and 2019. The results show that GDP, natural gas rents, and RE variables are non-stationary at level (0) in the existence of structural breaks. The structural breaks mentioned have consequences because of the shocks and changes of events globally. GDP was affected mostly in 2009 and 2019. 2019 was the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic, which devastated the global economy and its health conditions. Many economies went into recession, and many went into depression, such as Srilanka, etc. Moreover, shocks or events related to the rest of the break years, such as 1999 China, entered the mainstream trading arena, which changed global politics. For RE, climate change was emphasized globally in 2017. After examining the data for unit roots with structural breaks, the study aims to establish the long-term co-integration of the dependent and independent variables. Table 4   confirms the long-term co-integration between RE and its explanatory factors. This holds for mineral rents, natural gas rentals, oil rents, and economic growth. Since the alternative hypothesis of long-term co-integration has F-statistics larger than the crucial values, it is therefore accepted. The study wants to evaluate the data, which is non-normal and non-linear, confirmed in the descriptive analysis of the data through simple quantile regression. The empirical results show that GDP positively and significantly affects RE consumption across quantiles. According to the findings, a 1% rise in GDP (economic growth) is associated with a 0.082% rise in RE production in Q_0.25, a 0.084% rise in Q 0.25  , Q m e d i a n ,   &  Q 0.75    . The results of economic growth with RE are highly significant, even at 1%. Economic growth results align with those of Iqbal et al. (2023) , Khezri et al. (2022)  and Shahbaz et al. (2022) . However, mineral rents are inversely related to RE at all quantiles, with substantial negative correlations at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels in the Q 0.25  , Q m e d i a n ,      and at the 5% and 10% levels in the upper quantiles. The relevance shows that the increase in RE strongly affects mineral rents. However, the mineral rents decrease RE expansion for sustainable development. These findings are similar to those of Tu et al. (2022)  and Zhao et al. (2022) . Furthermore, the global link between oil rents and RE is unstable. The results are significant in the lower and median quantiles but become insignificant in the upper quantiles, representing a weak relationship and inconclusive in the upper quantiles. Oil rents have a big share in the world’s energy resources and generate enough revenues to have sustainability in countries, but they still need more sustainability globally. The results align with the outcomes of Chishti and Dogan (2022) , Khan et al. (2020)  and Mahmood and Saqib (2022) . However, natural gas rents harm RE at both the lower and higher quantiles. The results are significant at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels. The correlation indicates that a 1% rise in natural gas rents will lead to a −0.090% drop in RE production in the quantiles Q 0.25  , Q m e d i a n ,    a n d  Q 0.75    . After examining the preliminary results through quantile regression, this study also investigates the data through the ARDL method. The first step is to select a model criterion that best fits for the ARDL to evaluate the data. Table 6    represents Archaic information criteria,” which includes different lags for different variables. The optimum lags for variables are as follows: REC = 2, GDP = 4, mineral rents = 1, and for the rest of the two, natural gas and oil rents have lagged up to = 4,4 in the criteria. Table 7   presents diagnostics test results which reveal that the values are insignificant. We can conclude that no problem of autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity exists in the model variables. The null hypothesis is accepted for both. Similarly, the stability test generated by CUSUM and CUSUM squares specifies that the critical values of both tests are within the line of 5% significance. Therefore, the model is stable. The study also examined the co-integration of the Join-F-statistics of variables via ARDL bound estimates test. Table 8   shows that the value of F-Joint statistics is 8.51, higher than the lower bound and lower than the upper bound statistics. Hence we observed that long-term co-integration exists among variables in the study. Both short- and long-term analysis constitute a second primary method employed in this study, providing insights without relying solely on stationary data series or co-integration. The results, which are presented in Tables 9 and 10   , detail the short- and long-term dynamics of the ARDL estimates, disclosing a variety of insights regarding the variables under consideration. It is observed that the GDP coefficient has a positive and substantial effect on the global consumption of RE. Long-term, this result is significant at the 5% and 10% levels, demonstrating the direct relationship between economic growth and the increased adoption of RE. The results indicate that a 1% increase in GDP can stimulate a short-term increase in RE consumption of 0.02% and a long-term increase of 0.025%. This suggests that as civilizations expand, their reliance on RE sources also increases, bolstering the viability of RE as a sustainable solution for an expanding global economy. This correlation between economic growth and consumption of RE highlights the importance of sustainable economic policies in fostering the transition to RE sources. The results are conclusive and match the findings of (Alola et al., 2023 ; Li et al., 2023 ; Suki et al., 2022 ). Moreover, the effect of mineral rents is negative and significant in short and long-run dynamics on RE by 5 and 10%, specifically in the long run. Increasing 1% mineral rents in the economy will decrease the use of RE by −0.021% in the global economy. The results are significant (Chishti and Dogan, 2022 ; Khan et al., 2022 , 2023 ; Li et al., 2023 ). Natural gas rents have a negative impact on RE, with even a 1% reduction in output being statistically significant. Therefore, a global decrease in RE use of −0.10% results from a 1% increase in natural gas rents. Consistent with Yuan et al. (2023)  and Khan et al. (2020)  findings. However, oil rents have both long- and short-term favorable benefits regarding RE. The outcomes of oil rents at 5% and 10% are substantial. 4.1 Discussion We have analyzed the quantile regression to understand the effect of variables in different categories and evaluated it in the different categorizations of quantiles/percentiles. Moreover, we also included ARDL to bring that effect into the short- and long-term results category. We have posted the findings of our methods in Tables 5, 9 and 10  correspondingly. The empirical findings suggest that GDP is positive and has a long-lasting affirmative effect on RE globally. This can be inferred that, on average, the world has turned towards the issue of climate change and emphasizes the climate pact in Paris, COP26, and COP27. Furthermore, there is a causal relationship between economic expansion and RE sources (Chen et al., 2022a ). Countries, mostly developed economies such as G7 and OECD, rely mostly on cleaner fuels which generate sustainable economic growth and promote the use of RE globally. Such steps decrease the burden on non-RE sources up to some extent, while mostly RE consumption is preferred for sustainable development practices. Top renewable energy economies have shown that economic growth is possible and has a lasting impact on renewable energy usage (Ramzan et al., 2023 ). Tables 5, 9 and 10  show evidence of economic growth in quantiles and also in the results for short- and long-term. The effect is gradually increasing, which shows that most developing economies are still lagging behind the utopia of a sustainable development state. However, efforts are underway, such as China recently installed 120 GW of solar energy generation plant, which accounts for 40% of world RE (Hordofa et al., 2022 ). Concerning the impact of mineral rents on renewable energy, the effect is negative and long-lasting in ARDL and gradually diminishes in the quantile regression. This phenomenon indicates that mineral rents still have a resource curse in most economies, including China, the African region, and the G7 economies. The effect of negativity can be traced back to the ‘90s when the excessive consumption of raw minerals removed sustainability from the process and also paved the way for inefficiency. However, mineral rents can now be utilized as a primary product for RE sources. Lithium and cobalt are the main products used in RE products by most countries (Aldakhil et al., 2020 ). Moreover, most economies have shown resource blessings without abundant mineral rents or other rents of natural resources (Khan et al., 2022b ). Hence, we propose that global policies should be formed to limit the extraction of mineral resources in an unsustainable manner which could increase the use of renewable energy products in the future. The effect of natural gas rents follows the same path as mineral rents. Still, it is highly significant and negative in ARDL estimates of short- and long-term results and remains insignificant in the upper quantile of quantile regression. Researchers have shown that relying too heavily on natural gas rents leads to a resource curse that dampens environmental stability, slows economic progress, and reduces people’s ability to switch to cleaner forms of energy (Li et al., 2023 ; Khan et al., 2022b ). Moreover, natural gas receives shocks and volatilities from different markets worldwide. Many countries depend on natural gas rents due to their lesser carbon emissions quality than coal rents. Natural gas inefficiency and unsustainability increase when geopolitical shocks or threats such as the Russian-Ukrainian conflict reduce the sustainability process of natural gas rents and their impact on renewable energy consumption. Conversely, the oil rents increase renewable energy in quantile regression and ARDL methods. The rationale provided that oil rents come from the high and top oil-producing economies such as OPEC, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. These countries have paved the way for innovative technology and increased the sustainability of the oil resources in the world. Moreover, the oil and renewable combination has focused on many RE vehicles, green production activities, and infrastructures. The increase in sustainability in natural resources, specifically oil rents, generates revenue streams that also increase investments in green energy projects like renewable energies and green innovation (Yang et al., 2023 ; Khan et al., 2022b ). When oil rents increase sustainably, it can generate jobs and other economic industries to support the long-term goals of renewable and economic outcomes.  4.2 Robustness check We used two primary methods and analyzed the data through quantile regression and ARDL. Both can handle non-linearity issues, serial correlation, and heteroskedasticity while working on non-stationary data. However, we still postulate this study’s parametric methods for robustness checks. We used FMOLS, DOLS, and CCR, which tackle issues mostly related to time series data regarding serial correlation, heteroskedasticity, and endogeneity. These three methods are equivocally better relative to each other; thus, we applied them to analyze the data. The results in Table 11   suggest that all the estimates obtained of the variables are similar to the main methods: quantile regression and ARDL estimates. However, the natural resources component of oil rents is insignificant, the only positive out of the three components observed in the study. Thus, we can conclude that the resource curse in natural resources is still in the global economy and needs to be revived by policymakers to turn it into a blessing for a better future for the world. Moreover, we use the Robust least squares method, which deals with influential observations and outliers in the data. Robust least squares are more powerful than the simple OLS. Thus, in Table 12  , we observed that the results are still obtained similarly, except for the oil rents, which are insignificant and inconclusive in the data. Thus, we conclude that the resource curse hypothesis exists globally and needs to be tackled to promote RE sources and enhances sustainability in the worldwide climate change. Figs. 2 and 3    reveal the stability tests of the ARDL model and depict that the critical values are between the significance lines (CUSUM and CUSUM Squares) to accept that model is stable.   5 Conclusion and policy implications 5.1 Conclusion The debate on natural resources curses or blessings is exhausted in the previous literature. However, the conflated and asymmetric reports have given no such conclusive outputs. The sustainable usage of natural resources is demanded worldwide, which should increase environmental sustainability and promote energy sources that are less harmful to the global climate and environment. Therefore, this study explores the impact of natural resource rents on global RE consumption from 1988 to 2021. This study included GDP as a control variable to further confirm our findings. Several econometric methods were employed in this investigation, including the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test with structural breaks, the Bayer-Hanck co-integration test for long-term co-integration, simple quantile regression, and ARDL estimates for the primary estimates. FMOLS, DOLS, CCR, and Robust least squares methods were employed for the robustness check analysis. It was discovered that variables were stationary at difference D(1) in the presence of structural breaks. RE consumption is observed to have a long-term co-integration with factors such as gross domestic product, mineral rents, oil rents, and natural gas rents. The empirical results demonstrate a favorable and statistically significant relationship between economic growth and RE consumption across all quantiles and in the short- and long-term dynamics. The global RE sustainability steps are reduced by 1% due to natural gas rentals and by 5% and 10% due to mineral rents, respectively. The results are also significant for short- and long-term dynamics. In contrast, oil rents' long- and short-term dynamics encourage the demand for RE. Except for oil rents, which become negligible and inconclusive in robustness check analysis, it is clear that the resource curse is present globally, as estimates are consistent with those obtained using ARDL and quantile regression. Such results indicate that developed and emerging economies support economic growth. However, the resources are still unsustainable and need more focus from world leaders and policymakers.  5.2 Policy implications The results of this research point to some important policy implications for managing renewable energy and natural resources.• Countries globally should diversify their investments. Countries must diversify their focus beyond natural resources and into other sectors. Reducing reliance on natural resources could be accomplished by emphasizing technological innovation and enhancing R&D. This diversification can encourage the development and marketing of renewable energy products, thereby contributing to global sustainability.  • Based on the findings of this research study, countries should further regulate their natural resource utilization. Following the epidemic, there was an increased exploitation of the Earth’s untouched resources. This trend must be regulated by comprehensive policy measures to prevent the resulting ‘resource curse’ from negatively affecting other economic sectors. These policies should encourage nations to prioritize more efficient and environmentally favorable technologies.  • Moreover, countries should promote economic development for sustainability. The research shows that economic growth generally increases the demand for renewable energy. This indicates that established and developing economies strive for a more sustainable future. However, low-income economies that have not yet prioritized renewable energy must cooperate. These countries will need to work together on a global scale, perhaps with the help of international organizations, to expand their usage of renewable energy. This will assist in reducing the strain on natural resources, effectively addressing the global resource curse.    These policy implications are intended to guide sustainable practices that balance the need for economic development and the imperative for environmental conservation, particularly by efficiently utilizing natural resources and promoting renewable energy.
