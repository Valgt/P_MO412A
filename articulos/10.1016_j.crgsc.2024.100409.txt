                  The world is currently facing significant challenges in reducing the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) through scientific methods, primarily by sequestering the CO2 in the soil. Biochar is a kind of charcoal that is primarily composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Due to its aromatic content, biochar can persist in the environment for an extended period and absorb greenhouse gases (GHG). Each year, biochar effectively captures an estimated amount of CO2 ranging from 1 to 35 gigatons (GtCO2) and 78 to 477 GtCO2 over this century. Biochar helps mitigate climate change by sequestering carbon in the soil for extended periods and consequently reducing GHG emissions. This enhances soil fertility, water retention capacity, and nutrient circulation, which promote higher crop yields. Biochar's by-products of biochar can be harvested and used as a renewable energy source. Besides, biochar integration can be effective in waste management strategies that mitigate the challenges of organic waste disposal. Biochar is also an efficient water purification element that favors climate action. Through the application of biochar alteration can be employed to establish carbon credits, and its methods can effectively reduce carbon emissions to an acceptable level. Biochar's unique properties, wide-spread applicability, cost-effectiveness, and trustworthy development prospects demonstrate great potential towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). This review discusses the properties, diverse applications, and social and technical impacts of biochar in the global carbon cycle towards sustainable development goals.

The world is currently facing significant challenges in reducing the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2 ) through scientific methods, primarily by sequestering the CO2  in the soil. Biochar is a kind of charcoal that is primarily composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Due to its aromatic content, biochar can persist in the environment for an extended period and absorb greenhouse gases (GHG). Each year, biochar effectively captures an estimated amount of CO2  ranging from 1 to 35 gigatons (GtCO2 ) and 78 to 477 GtCO2  over this century. Biochar helps mitigate climate change by sequestering carbon in the soil for extended periods and consequently reducing GHG emissions. This enhances soil fertility, water retention capacity, and nutrient circulation, which promote higher crop yields. Biochar's by-products of biochar can be harvested and used as a renewable energy source. Besides, biochar integration can be effective in waste management strategies that mitigate the challenges of organic waste disposal. Biochar is also an efficient water purification element that favors climate action. Through the application of biochar alteration can be employed to establish carbon credits, and its methods can effectively reduce carbon emissions to an acceptable level. Biochar's unique properties, wide-spread applicability, cost-effectiveness, and trustworthy development prospects demonstrate great potential towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). This review discusses the properties, diverse applications, and social and technical impacts of biochar in the global carbon cycle towards sustainable development goals.   Keywords Biochar  Charcoal  Carbon cycle  Pyrolysis  Sustainable development   Data availability No data was used for the research described in the article.   1 Introduction The carbon cycle is a natural process in which carbon atoms are recycled in the atmosphere and then stored as carbon dioxide (CO2 ) and carbon monoxide (CO) in organisms, soil, and the ocean [1 ]. The carbon cycle is crucial for preserving the equilibrium of carbon in the atmosphere. Nevertheless, the carbon cycle, which is a vital component of the environment, is inflicting harm upon it. The reutilization of CO2 , a greenhouse gas (GHG), would lead to a progressive increase in its concentration, causing environmental and life-threatening damage [2 ] To tackle these difficulties and advance sustainable development on a global scale, the United Nations (UN) has proclaimed the 17 Sustainable Development Goals [3 ]. By minimizing carbon emissions in the environment, several concerns can be effectively addressed. Biochar has significant potential as a component in achieving the global carbon cycle, which is important for reaching sustainable development targets (SDGs) [4 ]. Biochar is a light, black charcoal-like substance derived from organic materials incinerated with little or no oxygen. Biochar is a type of charcoal that is created through pyrolysis, a process that involves heating organic materials. It is significant in the global carbon cycle. Pyrolysis is a process where biomass is heated without the presence of oxygen, leading to the creation of biochar, as well as bio-oil and syngas. The carbon to biochar exhibits a high degree of stability and can persist in the soil for a prolonged period [5 ]. The discussion materials also include the background of biochar research, and its uses is also included in the discussion materials. In the case of agricultural treatment, biochar can eliminate some heavy materials from the soil and make the soil perfect for harvesting time. Biochar is very lightweight and active for reaction, and it is also used as a catalyst in many industries and laboratories [6 ]. One nation can use biochar as an export material because it has a wonderful economic value. Some tree plants use biochar as their medicine to cure some fatal diseases. This material can also be prepared from biomass, food-coating waste, and wood, a very low-cost method [7 ]. Biochar, in relation to sustainable development goals, has the potential to effectively remove food shortages, conserve good health, purify wastewater, and contribute to producing medicine [8 ]. The type of feedstock and pyrolysis conditions used and utilized may impact biochar productivity [6 ]. It has repercussions, including both soil remediation and the economy. Biochar materials have been tested as anode materials for Li+  and Na+  batteries in the lab, while graphite is applied in commercialized Li+  batteries [9 ]. To get better electrochemical outputs, the surface properties can be changed, holes can be added, and the morphology, microscopic variations, and nano structuring of these biochar and carbon nanomaterials can be improved. Biochar's new application is that it is used as an element of polymeric construction materials, mainly as a sustainable alternative to cement, sand, and other energy-intensive combinations used in concrete production [10 ]. Again biochar, help mitigate climate change by sequestering carbon for prolonged periods. Hence, there is a reduction in overall GHG emissions. The adoption of this technique in agricultural soils not only enhances soil fertility, water retention, and nutrient cycling but also promotes higher crop productivity, in line with Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) [11 ] and Sustainable Development Goal 15 (Life on Land) [12 ]. Additionally, the renewable energy byproducts generated from biochar synthesis make a valuable contribution to SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) [13 ], providing an environmentally benign substitute for conventional fossil fuels. Incorporating biochar into waste management techniques effectively tackles the issues associated with organic waste disposal while aiding in mitigating climate change. This is consistent with SDG 12, which focuses on promoting responsible consumption and production, and SDG 13, which aims to address climate change [14 ]. Moreover, for their use in agriculture, biochar's porous structure and microbial activity can provide advantages in water filtration and purification, which is in line with SDGs 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) [15 ,16 ]. Although biochar production shows potential, scalability and cost-effectiveness are still obstacles to overcome [17 ]. Therefore, further research and optimization are required to exploit its benefits fully. Integrating biochar into sustainable land management practices offers a harmonious strategy to tackle climate change, improve agricultural sustainability, and contribute to the framework of sustainable development goals. Many articles have reported the carbon sequestering activity as well as the GHG reduction of biochar and their impact on the global carbon cycle. For instance, Yang and Yang (2023) [18 ], have reported the carbon sequestration and GHG reduction activity and summarized the application of biochar in wastewater treatment. Another review [19 ], assessed several mechanisms involved in the production of biochar that influences their application, food production and environmental sustainability to formulate biochar for clean agriculture production. Jha et al.,  (2022) [20 ] summarized sources properties and synthesis routes of biochar; adsorption mechanisms for removing contaminants all the mentioned attributes correlate with one specific SDG. Furthermore, Yuan et al. (2023) [21 ] outlined many mechanisms by which biochar might impact certain factors such as pH, cation exchange, soil organic carbon, redox, and nutrients to enhance the condition of salt-affected soil. Additionally, discussed the corresponding physical and chemical indicators. However, the study failed to include the overall impact of biochar on the global carbon cycle, which is in line with the SDGs and has the potential to benefit both humans and the environment. This article aims to provide a broad analysis of biochar intended to scrutinize the most efficient way to reduce excess carbon emissions by their vast application. Furthermore, the review would justify that biochar is compatible with achieving the mentioned SDGs.  2 Brief history Agriculture emerged millennia ago to ensure survival. Food supply and economic development in developing countries are very crucial worldwide. Agriculturalists began using organic manure to enrich the soil, enhancing plant nutrition, promoting soil porosity, and increasing water retention capacity. However, due to the rapid growth of the global population, farmers began exerting greater pressure on their terrestrial landscapes to produce food, textiles, and fuel to satisfy the increasing demand. Simultaneously, they had to consider adopting a more efficient approach due to the changing climate and the consequent deterioration of cultivable fields. In addition, contemporary agriculture depends on potent chemical components that contaminate our water and air. Carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide are prevalent emissions from current agricultural practices, contributing to climate change and elevating world temperatures. Therefore, it was imperative to discover a highly effective method. Fig. 1   presents a comparative analysis of the Terra preta and regular soil profiles. Terra preta, commonly called ‘Amazonian dark earth,’ was used by people throughout the pre-Columbian era. This form of soil includes durable organic black carbon waste [22 ]. It was employed to counteract the poisonous soil and eliminate its toxicity. Several centuries, if not millennia, have elapsed since these soils were established. It has a carbon content that is 70% higher than other soils and maintains its productivity even after substantial agricultural usage [23 ] Terra preta enhances soil weathering, enabling the extraction of significant quantities of carbon from the Earth's atmosphere, hence reducing the levels of carbon dioxide that contribute to the issue of global warming. Upon utilizing charcoal as a soil supplement, researchers observed an initial harmful effect of the charcoal on the soil. The plant was excessively extracting nutrients from the soil. Consequently, researchers endeavored to discover a method for replicating the fertility observed in terra preta. As a result, academic investigations on biochar saw a significant surge. Terra preta was an unfavorable choice because of its susceptibility to variations in climate, soil conditions, and crop types. Consequently, the exportation of terra preta was not a viable choice. Furthermore, the precise method of how terra preta was created remained undisclosed. Researchers drew inspiration from terra preta and substituted biochar with it due to its well-documented advantages and efficient usage in agricultural practices [23 ].  3 Biochar structure and properties Biochar is a carbon-rich substance that resembles charcoal and is produced by burning organic materials in a low-oxygen environment. The process of thermal degradation of biomass, known as pyrolysis, is referred to as such. Pyrolysis is an environmentally favorable method that may reduce fuel usage by a significant amount [25 ]. Biochar significantly enhances soil fertility, stimulates plant development through root interactions, and aids in plants' absorption and conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) conversion by plants. Biochar is capable of effectively extracting heavy metals and other pollutants from soil. They could produce sustainable energy from agricultural sources ecologically consciously [26 ]. The pyrolysis process, which in modern times involves the controlled decomposition of biomass under oxygen-limited conditions, produces biochar. This is done in the fields of soil remediation and waste transfer. The system's temperature and the amount of living matter have the most significant impact on the composition of biochar Elevated pyrolysis temperatures are often noticed in the enlarged surface zone and carbonized division of biochar, resulting in enhanced potential for the sorption of toxins Biochar derived from organic materials possesses unique surface characteristics, porosity, and a combination of functional group properties, all of which play a significant role in determining the impact of biochar. Studies have demonstrated that biochar effectively enhances soil characteristics and promotes biomass growth [27 ] Additionally, it has been suggested that it might improve the author's ability to combat disease. Recently, biochar has been employed to remediate soil contaminated with heavy metals and natural toxins [28 ,29 ]. The instruments involved are surface adsorption, partition, and sequestration for considerable metals. However, for natural pollutants, surface adsorption, partition, and sequestration are also used. Fig. 2    displays the layered chemical structure of biochar [23 ] (see Fig. 3 ). The pyrolysis conditions and the feedstock's characteristics determine the biochar's physical and chemical properties, such as pore size, composition, molecule, and pore estimate dissemination. These factors not only define the behavior of the biochar but also affect its suitability for a specific operation and its fate within the environment. Biochar exhibits significant heterogeneity in its characteristics, both within individual particles and within biochar samples obtained from different feedstocks or produced using different pyrolysis settings. The features of biochar have been described in terms of cation exchange capacities (CECs), which range from zero to around 40 cmolc/g. Additionally, the carbon-to-nitrogen ratios have been shown to grow up to 500. Consequently, the pH at this location remains relatively stable and impartial towards critical factors. While the variety of factors involved in biochar production can complicate the identification of specific elements contributing to its effects in scientific writing, it also allows for the customization of biochar properties to best suit a particular location's hydrology, weather, intended use, soil contaminants, and soil type [31 ].  4 Preparation of biochar 4.1 Biochar from general biomass Biochar is a cost-effective adsorbent that is widely used in water treatment. The research investigated the viability of polymerizing biowaste such as orange peels, peanut shells, and sugarcane skins at a temperature of 700 °C to produce biochar instead of expensive woody biomass. Subsequently, batch experiments were employed to determine the optimal water purification duration, temperature, and dose. The orange peels, peanut shells, and sugarcane skins exhibited ammonia nitrogen (NH4 + -N) removal rates of 74.4%, 96.3%, and 90.8%, respectively. Additionally, they demonstrated synchronous constant index exclusion efficiencies of 26.6%, 31.0%, and 26.6% respectively [32 ]. There were no significant changes in NH4+-N levels and exclusion efficiencies when the amount of 3 kinds of biochar applied was slightly more than 1 g/100 mL of water. The adsorption capacity of biochar for contaminants exhibited an upward trend when the temperature was elevated from 10 °C to 30 °C. The statistics support our prediction that bio-waste might serve as a viable supply of raw materials for biochar synthesis [33 ]. Biochar is produced from sugarcane rinds, peanut shells, and orange peels [34 ]. Pyrogenic decomposition was employed to produce biochar from biowastes. The orange peel, peanut shells, and sugarcane rind were obtained and cut into small sections measuring between 0.3 cm and 0.5 cm. These portions were then subjected to a draining process for 20 h at a temperature of 50 °C. The experiment involved placing peanut shells, orange peel, and 15 g of drained sugarcane rind in a vacuum tube furnace. The temperature attempted to increase at a pace of 5 °C per minute and reached a maximum of 700 °C, remaining at that level for 0.5 h. The biochar samples were measured in terms of weight following the carbonization process. The following graphic displays a hypothetical flow diagram of biochar manufacturing from biomass.  4.2 Biochar from unwanted plant litter A magnetic biochar composite (MB) was synthesized using a simple single pot solvothermal process by selecting biochar generated from Phoenix tree leaves as the carbon mixture. The MB form optimization was achieved by manipulating the particle size of Fe2 O3  nanoparticles on biochar and adjusting the load ratio. To get a deeper understanding of the construction process of MB, scientists investigated the development and composition changes of the liquid and solid phases throughout the heterogeneous solvothermal process [35 ]. Initially, the oxygen-containing groups present in biochar interacted with Fe (II)/Fe (III) ions, resulting in the formation of iron (Fe) hydroxides by hydrolysis. Subsequently, the iron (Fe) containing substances underwent thermal reduction and decomposition, resulting in the formation of iron oxides and the appearance of Fe3 O4  nanoparticles [35 ]. The MB exhibited a higher adsorption capacity for Cr (VI) in an aqueous solution, valued at 55.0 mg/g. This was superior to the adsorption capacities of biochar (39.8 mg/g) and Fe3 O4  nanoparticles (26.5 mg/g). As we know, biochar, made up of carbon, provides sites for Cr (VI) to attach to and groups that donate electrons to reduce Cr (VI). On the other hand, Fe3 O4  nanoparticles prevent the newly created Cr (III) from being released by forming a compound called Fe3+- Cr3+  hydroxide. At a pH of 2.0, MB's structure was more stable than that of a similarly made magnetic biochar sample, which meant that less iron leaked out. The use of biochar in wastewater management has a wide variety of applications, and additional investigation is needed to understand the mechanisms of biochar in environmental contexts [36 ].  4.3 Biochar from food wastes The suitability of solid biochar derived from anaerobic digestion of food waste was evaluated as a viable source for producing biochar by pyrolysis. The apparent activation energy during pyrolysis was estimated using Starink's, ranging from 144.64 kJ mol−1  to 293.36 kJ mol−1 . The process exhibited expansion within the range of 0.10–0.90 [29 ]. The analysis of the release of volatile substances was accurately and continuously conducted using TG–FTIR–MS. The results indicated that mass loss was caused by dehydration and carbon dioxide release. In the second stage of the pyrolysis process, the emission of light hydrocarbons was permitted. Characterization methods like BET, XRF, and EA, SEM, TEM was used to analyze the biochar's surface features and elemental contents at different pyrolysis temperatures. The acquired results provide an alternative approach for disposing of waste produced during the anaerobic digestion of food waste [36 ]. In this study, we examined the potential of using solid digestate, made from the anaerobic digestion of food waste, as a suitable material for producing biochar by pyrolysis. The deceptive activation energy during pyrolysis was calculated using the Starink method, ranging from 144.64 kJ mol−1  to 293.36 kJ mol−1 , with the conversion increasing from 0.10 to 0.90, to gain a deeper understanding of the pyrolysis mechanism. The TG–FTIR–MS system was employed to monitor the real-time progression of released volatile compounds. The findings indicate that the primary factors contributing to the reduction in mass were dehydration and the release of CO2. In contrast, the emission of light hydrocarbons occurred during the second stage of the pyrolysis process Elemental analysis (EA), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) techniques were necessary to ascertain the composition of elements and surface properties of the biochar produced under different pyrolysis settings. The findings offer an additional method for managing waste produced by anaerobic digestion of food waste [36 ].  4.4 Biochar materials’ modification Biochar is often produced from biomass and solid waste materials, such as agricultural and forestry residues, sludge, and animal and poultry manure, to create a valuable new substance. The ability of biochar to eliminate pollutants, reduce GHG emissions, and remediate contaminated soil has driven its use on a global scale. This study examined the physicochemical properties of biochar, the factors involved in its production, the impacts of different preparation methods and modification techniques, and the process of using biochar to remediate soil contamination. Biochar in soil remediation has garnered attention in recent years, particularly for its ability to mitigate the presence of heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and enhance soil quality. Finally, the researchers investigated the hazards associated with using biochar and the prospective areas for future research [37 ].   5 Biochar in global carbon cycle benefits Biochar has been recognized as a durable substance that may effectively store carbon in the soil for extended periods. The system incorporates responsive surfaces that absorb nutrients, avoiding leakage and enhancing fertilizer output while lowering pollution [38 ]. The efficacy of biochar in eliminating toxins and contaminants from soil and water is contingent upon the specific biomass type employed and the temperature at which pyrolysis occurs. Biochar rich in carbon and produced at high pyrolysis temperatures has enhanced characteristics such as increased surface area, porosity, pH, decreased carbon content in dissolved circumstances, and hydrophobic nature, resulting in improved effectiveness for removing emerging contaminants. Biochar made at lower temperatures has functional groups that contain oxygen, more dissolved organic carbon, and fewer holes, all of which make it better at getting rid of inorganic contaminants. Biochar-based application in soil enhances soil quality and promotes microbial growth by neutralizing soil pH and improving soil cation exchange potential. Biochar contains functional groups, including carboxylic, hydroxyl, and phenolic groups, which interact with hydrogen ions in the soil, decreasing their concentration and increasing pH levels. The bicarbonates, carbonates, and silicates in biochar undergo a chemical reaction with H+ ions in the soil, neutralizing pH. Biochar contains significant amounts of calcium, potassium, nitrogen, and phosphorus, which contribute nutrients to the soil and can function as a food supply for the soil's microbial community [39 ]. Biochar improves rainwater infiltration by increasing accumulation. Consequently, biochar possesses the capacity to enhance the drought resistance of agricultural systems [38 ]. Several studies have shown that biochar significantly improves crop yields by 5–50 tons per hectare when combined with effective fertilizer management. Biochar can mitigate the release of GHGs such as nitrous oxide (N2 O) and methane (CH4 ), decrease nutrient pollution in groundwater, enhance resource retrieval, and lessen the volume of waste carried to disposal sites, which have several environmental advantages [40 ]. Biochar can help avoid the emission of GHGs like nitrous oxide (N2 O) and methane (CH4 ), reduce nutrient contamination in groundwater, increase resource recovery, and minimize the quantity of garbage transported to disposal areas. All of which have several environmental benefits [38 ]. Biochar reduces the emission of harmful gases (such as NO, N2 O, NH3 , and CH4 ) into the atmosphere when applied to the soil by immobilizing inorganic nitrogen, influencing enzyme activities involved in gas production, and altering soil physical properties (such as texture, structure, porosity, density, and temperature. This can enhance water-nutrient retention and decrease soil bulk density. Fertilizers are necessary to guarantee worldwide food security, yet their production process requires substantial energy and releases significant quantities of GHGs. Research has found that replacing non-organic fertilizers with soil conditioners generated from biochar enhances soil conditions while stabilizing organic carbon and decreasing GHG emissions [41 ]. A proposition has been made to utilize biochar to segregate heavy metal ions from wastewater. The removal methods vary depending on the valence state of the target heavy metal and the pH of the solution. It has been suggested that biochar has four primary mechanisms for removing heavy metals from water: The interaction between heavy metals and biochar occurs through electrostatic forces on the surface. This interaction involves alkaline substances, heavy metals, and protons at the interface between biochar or earth metals, leading to ion exchange. Additionally, complex formation occurs between surface functional groups and electron-rich domains. Co-precipitation is also utilized to make compounds that cannot be melted. The use of chitosan-treated biochar effectively eliminated three heavy metals (Cadmium (II), Lead (II), and Copper (II) from liquid solutions [42 ,43 ]. Additional examination of Pb2 C sorption reveals that the biochar has a significant Langmuir sorption potential of 14.3 mg/g despite its sluggish kinetics. Biochar can eliminate various substances from water bodies, such as pesticides, antibiotics, indicator organisms, pathogens, and inorganic ions [44 ]. Biochar could be produced from wasted organic materials and garbage; they can be a cost-efficient supplement to filtration systems [45 ]. Unlike expensive filtering methods that selectively target certain organic substances or heavy metals, feedstock-based biochar can filter out all metals and organic compounds [41 ]. Europe is now utilizing biochar in animal production at a rate of 90%. Contrary to its use on fields, a farmer will see the results within a few days. When a farmer uses it for feeding, composting, or slurry management, they will observe a significant decrease in odor. When used as a substitute for feed, the incidence of diarrhea diminishes promptly, feed consumption increases, allergies diminish, and animals exhibit a more tranquil demeanor [46 ]. Biochar is a highly effective material for insulating and regulating humidity in residential buildings. When combined with clay, biochar can substitute for sand in lime and cement mortars. It can also be used in conjunction with cement mortar and lime. This technology can create indoor plasters that have outstanding insulation and ventilation properties. These plasters can maintain a room's humidity level at 45–70 percent during winter and summer. It removes dry air, which can lead to respiratory problems and allergies, and eliminates moisture and condensation on walls, promoting mold formation. Biochar can be mixed with lime and applied to a building's outside walls using a jet-spray method [47 ]. It can substitute for Styrofoam insulation in thicknesses of up to 20 cm. These enclosed houses function as carbon sinks while offering a more environmentally friendly internal atmosphere. The biochar-lime mortar can serve as a valuable fertilizer component if the home is demolished in the future [46 ]. China and Japan are now using bamboo-derived biochar in fabrics to enhance respiratory properties, provide thermal insulation, and minimize the production of sweat odors. To accomplish the same objective, biochar is employed in the soles of shoes and socks. Biochar can absorb sweat and odors, provide a barrier against electromagnetic radiation (electropollution), and remove negative ions from the outermost layer of the skin. Additionally, it may function as an effective thermal insulator that deflects heat, enabling us to sleep comfortably throughout the summer without excessive heat accumulation. For an extensive duration, biochar has been utilized in Japan to stuff cushions. They can help you stay awake during the night and alleviate any soreness in your neck [46 ].  6 Biochar in agricultural applications and its effects on the global carbon cycle This study is the first to investigate the production, characterization, and utilization of synthetic biochar derived from alfalfa hays to remove tetracycline (TC) from water. The surface area (796.50 m2  g-1 ) and pore volume (0.087 cm3  g-1 ) of raw charcoal generated from alfalfa (BCR) saw a considerable increase during NaOH activation. The NaOH-activated BC (BCA) exhibited a much greater capacity for adsorbing TC (Qm = 302.37 mg-1) than the BCR. However, its adsorption performance was comparable to commercially available activated carbon (Calgon F400). The extensive study on kinetic and isotherm research results indicates that TC and BCA exhibit significant chemisorption interactions through many routes. Moreover, the hindrance caused by intraparticle diffusion was recognized as a substantial obstacle to the adsorption of TC on BCA. The fixed bed studies also indicated that BCA might be a promising adsorbent for treating large quantities of TC-contaminated water in the columns [48 ]. Biochar is a porous, carbon rich, stable charcoal like substance. Due to the pyrolysis process the volatile gases are diminished which rejects oxidation and increases the shelf life of biochar. Therefore, when biochar is added to the soil microorganisms are not able to degrade them. Rather the biochar sequestrates CO2  and being resistant to decompose biochar could capture carbon for a long time [49 ]. Because of their physiochemical properties biochar can capture carbon for an extended period. Biochar has high carbon content with thermal stability and a recalcitrant aromatic carbon structure that contribute to carbon sequestration. The significant carbon content of biochar is crucial for its ability to sequester carbon due to various factors. Firstly, it allows biochar to function as a stable storage unit for carbon. When biochar is added to the soil, it serves as a reservoir, efficiently absorbing and holding carbon for long periods of time, thus avoiding its emission into the atmosphere as CO2  [50 ,51 ]. Furthermore, the copious carbon content of biochar enables a greater saturation of carbon in the soil. By incorporating biochar into the soil, it introduces extra carbon that surpasses the soil's inherent capacity to retain carbon [52 ]. The excess carbon can be efficiently captured, leading to a general rise in soil carbon reserves and offsetting the overall rise in atmospheric CO2  levels [53 ]. Moreover, due to its high carbon concentration and resistant characteristics, biochar can remain in the soil for long periods of time without experiencing substantial carbon loss. The extended lifespan of the sequestered carbon guarantees its storage in the soil, offering a dependable and enduring method for carbon sequestration. The structure inhibits the microbes from decomposing it [54 ]. Moreover, the large internal and external surface areas enhance the adsorption and physical entrapment of CO2  and due to this reason, the carbon stabilization the enhanced. Carbon sequestration follows a direct and an indirect mechanism. Regarding the direct mechanism Carbon directly binds with the biochar. In contrast, the indirect sequestration has various mechanisms including enhanced plant growth, suppressed methane emission [55 ]. The capacity of biochar to sequester carbon in the form of Carbon is significantly influenced by its particle size and surface area. Reduced particle sizes (with a diameter smaller than 0.045 mm) and increased surface areas (more than 100 m2 /g) provide multiple benefits [56 ]. Decreasing the size of the particles first increases the surface area of contact between the biochar and its surroundings. This promotes the interaction and adsorption of GHG like CO2 . This enhanced interaction facilitates the more effective absorption and preservation of carbon inside the biochar framework. A recent study investigated the effects of biochar generated from different-sized Camellia oleifera fruit shells [54 ,57 ]. The results showed that the smallest shell sizes (0.5–2 mm) had the lowest rates of CO2  emissions. Particles with larger dimensions, specifically ranging from 2 to 5 mm or 5–10 mm, typically exhibit a reduced ratio of surface area to volume. This characteristic can restrict the ability of microorganisms to reach and break down these particles [58 ]. Consequently, bigger biochar particles may display a decrease in the release of CO2  because of a decline in microbial activity and slower rates of breakdown. Furthermore, biochar that have larger surface areas possess a higher quantity of binding sites for organic carbon molecules, which consequently improves their capacity to sequester carbon. The increased surface area of the biochar allows for greater absorption of organic materials, effectively converting it into carbon storage in the soil. Moreover, the biochar's surface area has an impact on the activity of microorganisms and the cycling of nutrients in the soil. Soil microorganisms can adhere to the charcoal surface, resulting in increased microbial colonization and activity. The microbial activity facilitates the breakdown of organic matter and the creation of stable carbon molecules, which in turn enhances the long-term storage of carbon [59 ,60 ]. Biochar can enhance soil fertility, promoting plant development by influencing their root systems and aiding plants in absorbing and converting carbon dioxide (CO2 ). Biochar also plays a role in removing heavy metals and other pollutants from soil. The system can produce sustainable energy from agricultural sources ecologically consciously [23 ]. The projected population increase indicates that the global population will reach 9 billion by 2050 [61 ]. Agriculture food output would have to increase by more than 50% to keep up with population growth [62 ,63 ]. The primary concerns with increasing harvests are climate change, water shortages, and land degradation, as these global challenges are closely interconnected with poverty and nutrition [14 ]. Increasing our harvest will accelerate global warming, as agriculture is a significant source of GHG emissions. This issue will have a detrimental impact on our agriculture management [14 ]. These are the primary obstacles to consider. To address these difficulties, it is necessary to implement agricultural adaptation, and mitigation measures must be implemented to reduce GHGs emissions while improving crop yields. Using organic fertilizer has proven successful in improving soil properties and increasing agricultural output [64 ]. The bar graphic below provides a concise and informative comparison of the variations in soil organic carbon stores. The following bar diagram shows a clear comparative view of the difference in soil organic carbon stocks. Biochar is a carbon-rich substance. It can hold 50% of the carbon from feedstocks [65 ]. Mixing biochar with soils affects its critical physical properties in a good, efficient way, like improving soil texture, structure, porosity, etc. Globally, a significant amount of methane is emitted by agricultural soils, especially from paddy rice soils, which contributes to global warming. These problems can be solved by using biochar. Still, the type of soil, the properties of biochar, and water conditions should all be considered since these are the critical factors that determine the effectiveness of biochar [66 ]. Biochar can stimulate soil microorganisms, resulting in increased microbial activity and biomass. It improves the soil's cation exchanging capacity, or CEC [67 ], which is a degree of the soil's ability to provide three of the most critical plant nutrients: calcium, magnesium, and potassium. With CEC, more nutrients can be attached to soil particles, increasing soil fertility. Biochar application to acidic soil would boost the average yield by 10% and nearly 14% [68 ]. The petition of biochar to maize crops receiving inorganic fertilizer enhanced grain output significantly in the fields that had been cultivated for almost 40 years or even more, according to a 2-year investigation in western Kenya [69 ]. Scientists were looking for a strategy to reduce the emanations of nitrous oxide (N2 O), a typical GHG. According to one study in south-eastern China, integrating biochar into rice paddy soils boosted rice yields by 12% and 14% in unfertilized soils, respectively, while lowering (N2 O) by 40–51% and 21–28% [70 ]. In soils treated with biochar, nitrogen dioxide emissions were 40–51% lower [71 ]. It was described that mixing 20 g of biochar into 1 kg of soil decreases nitrogen dioxide emissions by up to 80% in grass pots and about 50% in soybeans [72 ]. In another report, applying rice straw biochar increased the rice yield by around 19.8% in 2009 and 21.6% in 2010, which was achieved without using urea [73 ]. When biochar was added to the soil in northern Laos sites, upland rice (Oryza sativa) grain yield increased with low pH availability [74 ]. Using steep slopes with a pH of about 5.2, biochar improved the growth of carrots and legumes [72 ]. Different studies have revealed that biochar can stimulate the soil microflora, which can help the soil to retain more carbon. Biochar may also be used to shelter bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi. Some biochar can upsurge the pH of the soil, which is particularly useful in different agricultural regions [75 ]. Non-woody feedstocks can provide nutritional support to plants because they are more readily mineralized than wood-derived biochar. The food waste biochar can boost plant's growth. Biochar also protects against air and soil bacteria [76 ]. According to a collaboration between All Power Labs (APL) and Gill Tract Community Farm, both situated in California, biochar dramatically alters plant growth behavior. They put co-composted biochar and conventional compost to the test in raised beds. The outcomes were both surprising and striking. Compared to the second site that employed ordinary compost, the site that used co-composted biochar demonstrated terrific fertility. Here's a diagram that compares composted biochar to composted plant-based biochar. Undoubtedly, biochar has significant advantages in agricultural management. Biochar has a multitude of benefits. Nevertheless, there are certain drawbacks. The inadequate use of biochar leads to a decline in crop yield and soil quality [77 ]. Studies have shown that applying an adequate amount of biochar increased soybean production by 51%. However, using more significant amounts of biochar resulted in a decline in soybean output, ranging from 37% to 71%. In separate field research, it was discovered that the use of teak and rosewood biochar resulted in a decrease in rice grain output by 10–26 percent [74 ]. The decrease could result from N2  immobilization caused by high C:N ratios [78 ]. Alkaline-intolerant species have liming and hydrophobic biochar characteristics [79 ]. When biochar is put into the soil, it can get saturated with water, leading to waterlogging. This can harm acid-loving plants and earthworms and reduce the effectiveness of pesticides applied to the soil. Adding biochar to soil rich in soil organic matter (SOM) might impede plant growth [80 ]. To summarize the advantages of biochar, it may be stated that biochar offers three primary benefits. Firstly, biochar can reduce carbon emissions in the atmosphere. Furthermore, the pyrolysis process employed in its manufacture emits energy that may be harnessed. Thirdly, adding nutrients to the soil enhances soil fertility and facilitates nutrient retention, providing plants with the necessary nourishment when required. This practice also greatly enhances growth rates and enables long-term nutrient storage [81 ]. With the multitude of ongoing issues, particularly the increasing population crisis, it is imperative to achieve equilibrium to fulfill demand while preserving a safe atmosphere. Occasionally, the process of enhancing soil nutrients may take a significant amount of time due to various factors. Therefore, it is advised that the implementation costs for any soil modification should be based on extensive field testing. The current production cost of biochar is substantial. Nevertheless, by diversifying the applications of biochar outside agriculture, we have the potential to reduce the production cost. Hence, it is important to do a thorough study and engage in practical implementation to effectively address and resolve the issues at hand effectively. By doing so, we can potentially overcome these challenges [82 ] (see Fig. 4 ).  7 Nano-biochar and its impacts on industrial waste management Biochar, which is a sustainable carbon-enriched byproduct prepared by the prolepsis of plant and animal biomass, and nano-biochar materials are gaining popularity due to their unique properties for environmental applications [78 ]. It has a high porosity, a sizeable, appropriate surface area, and an excellent capability to adsorb various contaminants, like HMs (Heavy Metals) [83 ]. Biochar productivity depends on the feedstock form used and the prolepsis conditions used. It has an impact on soil remediation as well as the economy. It demonstrates substantial progress in contracting GHGs and global warming, sequestering atmospheric carbon in the soil, increasing food production, and decreasing the salability of environmental contamination [84 ]. Subsequently, it becomes a high-value material that helps to sustain the economy. Bioeconomy uses and investigates bioresources, opening new avenues for biotechnology and creating new economic-valued bio-products [45 ]. Conversely, biochar is used in various industries, including agriculture, manufacturing, and energy. As a result, biochar processing will boost soil properties and increase income opportunities. The relationship between the nanoparticles of biochar (nano-BC) and the origins of the plant in the rhizosphere is mainly unidentified. This is a critical understanding of biochar in plant growth and pollutant bioavailability. Nano-biochar impacts at various temperatures (300–600 °C) reduce Cd2+  phytotoxicity in rice plants [45 ]. High-temperature nano-biochar can substantially reduce Cd2+  phytotoxicity more than low-temperature and bulk biochar. Nano-biochar has a solid attraction for Cd2+ , meaning rice plants have more biomass, fertile roots, chlorophyll-ll production, less MDA content, and better electrical conductivity. Besides, nano-biochar destroys the net flux of Cd2+  in many areas of the root orders. Nonetheless, compared to a Cd2+  (5.0 mm g/L) treatment alone, nano-biochar (mainly that was produced at higher levels of temperatures increases the insides of antioxidative enzyme actions (e.g., CAT, POD, and SOD) and soluble types of proteins. That implies that nano-biochar can activate oxidative stress in rice plants and substantially reduce Cd2+  uptake and phytotoxicity [45 ]. In Fig. 5   , the effect of using biochar nanoparticles on the growth of rice plants is shown. Due to the expansion of urbanization and human industrial activities, many pollutants, such as heavy metals (HMs), have emerged as a worldwide menace and subject of apprehension [85 ]. Elevated concentrations of hazardous substances in aquatic environments have diverse impacts on human well-being and produce unfit water for consumption. The presence of rocks and soils in water bodies is the primary natural factor contributing to water pollution with harmful substances, namely heavy metals [86 ]. HM pollution is caused mainly by getting rid of and treating wastewater with HMs or partially treated wastewater with HMs in it and by having HM-containing substances in fertilizers like phosphate fertilizers [6 ,87 ,88 ]. Due to their insoluble nature and high toxicity, HMs can be gathered in human bodies and cause numerous diseases, frailties, and cancers [89 ]. Cadmium (Cd) is among the HMs that exhibit the most significant toxicity to human beings. Cadmium doses within the range of 10–326 and 300 to 3500 are toxic and fatal to humans, and prolonged and continuous exposure to these levels leads to impairment of kidney functions [90 ]. The TEM image of the biochar surface is shown in the following image (Fig. 6  ). Various biochar materials have been used to remove heavy metals (HMs) from water-based systems. Utilizing nano-compounds in the surface composition of biochar is thought to enhance the efficiency of eliminating contaminants. The efficacy of walnut-shell biochar (WSB) alone or in conjunction with nanoscale particle zerovalent iron (WSB-nZVI) in removing cadmium from a solution is influenced by four factors: beginning solution pH, initial cadmium concentration, contact time, and adsorbent dose. WSB-nZVI prioritizes the efficacy of cadmium removal in aqueous solutions. The presence of functional groups on the top surface of WSB and nZVI, formed during precipitation and adsorption processes, enhances the capacity of WSB natural adsorbent to remove Cd. According to research, the predicted effectiveness of removing Cd was 99.72% with an interest rate of 1. This was achieved with an initial Cadmium concentration of 70.78 mgL−1 , an adsorbent dosage of 0.56 g L-1 , a pH of 6.92, and an interaction period of 40.42 min [92 ]. Many established techniques are employed to remove heavy metals (HMs) from a solution, including chemical precipitation, phytoremediation, ultrafiltration, ion exchange, electrodialysis, reverse osmosis, and sorption [27 ]. The sorption approach has recently emerged as a cost-effective and efficient way to eliminate heavy metals [15 ]. To attain sustainable growth, it is imperative to prioritize the management of agricultural waste. Commercially, activated carbon (CAC), an expensive substance, is the most employed adsorbent for decreasing various pollutants. Currently, we are searching for a cost-effective substitute for CAC as an adsorbent component. The utilization of nano-composite-based biochar as a designed biochar to extract toxins from water bodies has been considered [93 ,94 ]. The synthesis of nanomaterial-based biochar enables the achievement of four interrelated objectives: waste disposal, reduction of pollutants, carbon sequestration, and power generation. Nanoscale zerovalent iron (nZVI) is being utilized in many investigations as an effective adsorbent for the dissolution of heavy metals (HMs) [95 ]such as Cd2+  [96 ], As5+  [97 ], Cr6+ , and Pb2+  [98 ,99 ]. Due to its reduction processes, adsorption matrix formation, and precipitation complexes. The nZVI particles make it harder for these substances to move around in the solution, which makes this adsorbent less effective [100 ]. Therefore, using nZVI as a support material on a solid surface seems to enhance their stability in water-based environments. The study found that the WSB-nZVI adsorbent was more effective than the WSB adsorbent in reducing Cd levels in various defined settings. The Cd2+ elimination values in WSB-nZVI samples varied between 31.2 and 99.16 percent, averaging 72.59%. In comparison, the range for Cd2+ elimination in WSB samples was 27.16–75.25%, with an average of 39.27% [92 ]. Arsenic is a toxic metalloid that can be present in both irrigation and drinking water. Adding zinc nitrate to biochar makes it better at absorbing As3+  by raising its adsorption potential from 5.7 mg/g to 7.0 mg/g [101 ]. Papermill's sludge was used to adsorb As5+  to produce biochar, achieving a maximum adsorptive capacity of 34.1 mg/g [102 ]. Biochar production combined and manipulated rice husk, sugarcane straw, chicken dung, and sawdust to remove Cadmium (II) from water. The data demonstrates that increasing the pyrolysis temperature from 350 °C to 650 °C leads to a higher percentage of Cd2+  elimination. Biochar is also efficient in the removal of Lead. The removal efficiency of Lead by biochar derived from fresh and dried banana peels are 359 mg/g and 193 mg/g, respectively [103 ]. Biochar from sawdust muck absorbed roughly 70 percent of the Cr3+  in the aqueous solution [104 ]. This overall adsorption prospective of Ni2+  from water by chicken compost varied with sawdust-derived biochar, which was 11 mg−1  at 650° C [105 ]. In oxygen-functional groups, marine macroalgae magnetic biochar is high, contributing to their high discernment and adsorption potential to Copper (II) (69.37 mgg−1  for kelp magnetic type biochar also 63.52 mg/g for hijiki magnetic biochar [106 ]. Several sectors generate industrial wastewater, such as smelting, mining, chemical manufacture, battery processing, leather making, and dye production. The main constituents found in industrial effluent are predominantly heavy metals and chemical pollutants. Biochar has been employed in the treatment of industrial effluent. Chitosan can be combined with biochar and then transformed into beads, solutions, and membranes by cross-linking. It is a highly effective adsorbent for removing heavy metals from industrial wastewater. The ratio of biochar to chitosan would impact the ability to adsorb heavy metals, such as cadmium, arsenic, copper, lead, and others, in industrial effluent [107 ]. In dye-based industries, it is Gliricidia biochar which is a likely material for removing ‘crystal violet’ (CV) from effluents. The surface area, pH, as well as biochar pore volume all influence the CV sorption mechanism [108 ]. Bagasse biochar was employed to absorb Pb (lead) from the wastewater generated during battery manufacture. The maximum adsorption capacity is 12.7 mg/g, and the adsorption process is influenced by the dosage [109 ], average pH, and contact duration. It was also employed to extract nutrients from dairy effluent containing phosphate and ammonium. Within 24 h, biochar can assimilate around 19–65% of phosphate and around 20–43% of ammonium presents in flushed dairy feed [88 ,110 ,111 ]. Thus far, most research on using biochar to eliminate contaminants from industrial wastewater has been conducted in controlled laboratory settings. However, further investigation and practical application in real-world conditions are necessary. The invasive plant Imperata cylindrica has extensively propagated across the United States. The southeastern region, the main rice-growing area, is experiencing an invasion that threatens rice output. However, the presence of nano-biochar resulting from cylindrical root exudates can reduce stress. Ferulic acid (FA) is a crucial compound in the root secretions of cylindrical. Nano-biochar has significant detoxifying effects on rice seedlings under FA treatments. The growth rate of rice seedlings is accelerated, and their physical characteristics are enhanced after being treated with nano-biochar at later stages. In the pot experiment, applying 200 mg kg-1 and 400 mg kg-1 of nano-biochar to the FA solution resulted in a 344% and 435% increase in seedling biomass, respectively, compared to the FA treatment [110 ,111 ]. The addition of nano-biochar leads to a subsequent decrease in the quantity of malondialdehyde, a marker of lipid peroxidation, and a decrease in the antioxidant system index. When nano-biochar C is added to the treatment of FA, the growth of rice is significantly improved. The overall chlorophyll content exhibits a pattern of recovery. The retrieval rates reached 55% and 96%, respectively, when 400 mgL−1  and 400 mgkg−1  of nano-biochar were introduced to the FA treatments in both pot trials and hydroponic systems [112 ]. The upregulation of three salicylic acid-related genes is seen following treatment with FA nano-biochar. Rice manufacturers can eliminate the problem of cylindrical invasion by utilizing nano-biochar. The extensive utilization of fossil fuels has led to a significant rise in apprehension regarding climate change. Consequently, ecologically friendly fuels are gaining growing significance [113 ]. We became intrigued by converting waste biomass into valuable fuels due to its high efficiency and cost-effectiveness in getting sustainable and clean energy sources. Fuel additives are a possible alternative for mitigating the detrimental environmental impact of cars. Various nano-metal additions have been discovered to reduce diesel engine emissions. Nevertheless, they possess hazardous effects on preexisting species and influence the environment. Bio-based nano-additives can be employed to a large extent to mitigate these problems [114 ]. The main outputs of the sugarcane industry are fuel oil and sugarcane bagasse. Sugarcane nano-biochar (SNB) is a suitable alternative to conventional metallic fuel additives due to its composition as a nanoparticle derived from bagasse. The optimal conditions for achieving a desirability rating of 66% were determined to be a mixture containing 10% fusel oil, an engine speed of around 2300 rpm, and the presence of one hundred parts per million SNBs. In addition, the increase in CO emissions caused by fusel oil/SNBs was up to 33%. However, this reduced UHC emissions by up to 20.51% and NOx by up to 14.6%, respectively. The rubber sector has the potential to utilize nano-biochar. Historically, trash from the rubber business, specifically the Lignin filter, was frequently incinerated or disposed of in rivers. The physicochemical changes in Lignin before and after carbonization seen in several tests were remarkable. The lignin-derived biochar (LB) comprised vesicle-like primary nanoparticles after being converted into highly value-added types of nano-biochar using a sustainable reinforcing filler of Styrene-Butadiene Rubber (SBR). The objects are tightly clustered to form a “highly structured” uneven debris with a surface area 83.41. Adding LB to SBR significantly enhances the tensile characteristics of LB or SBR composites. The LB has a similar strengthening effect on SBR as industrial carbon black (CB) N330. The structural characteristics and surface properties of these fillers and the composition, stress-strain behavior, and complicated mechanical performance of rubber-type composites filled with CB and LB demonstrate apparent variations in reinforcing processes. The potential of using Lignin as a sustainable alternative to carbon black in the rubber sector has led to both economic and environmental advantages in the process of lignin removal. However, the scientific community has not given sufficient attention to the harmful effects of nano-biochar on both ecosystem health and human well-being. Further investigation and testing are necessary to fully understand the limitations of nano-biochar in practical uses, including its propensity to clump together and its limited productivity [43 ,115 ]. In addition, because of the increasing interest in the study issue, the available data are inadequate for fully understanding the composition and characteristics of nano-biochar [116 ]. Hence, the following research endeavors should prioritize the enhancement of methodologies to augment nano-biochar production, mitigate agglomeration, optimize electrode supercapacitor fabrication, and deepen our comprehension of toxicological attributes [117 ,118 ].  8 Biochar as catalyst 8.1 Production of biochar catalyst Developing an eco-friendly catalyst to produce biodiesel is crucial in reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Biochar may be produced by the slow pyrolysis of sawdust obtained from rural wood. Biochar was produced by varying the heating duration and reaction temperature. The sulfonation process was employed to produce solid acid catalysts. The sulfonated catalyst and biochar were analyzed using Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Elemental analysis, Diffraction (XRD), Powder X-ray, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Surface area analyzer (BET), and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) to determine their properties. The study found that the sulfonation process of biochar involved consuming several functional acidic groups, including strong acidic –OH groups, weak acidic –COOH groups, and SO3 H groups, by a solid acid catalyst based on biochar [119 ]. There are many ways to produce biochar-based catalysts which are given below.I. The synthesis of the catalyst is biochar based on sawdust.  II. Pyrolysis of cellulose: A different catalyst supported for methanol electro-oxidation [120 ].     8.2 Biochar catalyst from sawdust Wood sawdust (WSD) was collected from a sawmill to prepare raw materials. Biochar was produced by the slow decomposition of sawdust by pyrolysis. Before starting slow pyrolysis, the biomass (WSD) underwent size reduction or grinding to achieve a particle size lower than 75 μm. Particles with a diameter of less than 75 μm were positioned adjacent to the dehydrated oven and exposed to a temperature of 80 °C for 24 h to eliminate any moisture present. The biomass was collected and placed in a desiccator for drying. Pongamia pinnata oil (PPO) was used as this method's basis oil. The molecular mass of oil was determined based on the saponification value and acid value. The chromatograph of Pongamia pinnata oil revealed the following weight percentages of fatty acids: Oleic acid (C18:1) - 55.74 wt%, Palmitic acid (C16:0) - 13.64 wt%, Gadoleic acid (C21:1) - 3.52 wt%, Behenic acid (C22:0) - 9.81 wt%, Arachidic acid (C20:0) - 4.4 wt%, Lignoceric acid (C24:0) - 4.03 wt%. Therefore, the primary component of fatty acid in the oil was identified. The reagents used in the experiment were sulfuric acid with a concentration range of 95%–98%, and methanol of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade [119 ].  8.3 Biochar from cellulose The electro-oxidation approach is directly obtained using a catalyst supported by a Bio-pack designed for methanol Cellulose samples. In the acid impregnation process, 1.00 g of microcrystalline cellulose was mixed with 5 mL of a 5% (w/w) aqueous phosphoric acid (H3 PO4 ) solution. The acid mixture was kept at a temperature range of 70–80 °C while continuously stirring using a magnetic stirrer for 2 h. Afterwards, the mixture was filtered using the necessary vacuum pressure, and the cellulosic material was dried at 40 °C under vacuum overnight [120 ].  8.4 Catalytic applications of biochar I. Influencing of carbonization condition on physiochemical effective characteristics of biochar found from sluggish pyrolysis of durian tree wood (Durio zibethinus) sawdust [121 ].  II.

Heteroatoms and carbon dioxide for singlet oxygenation and electron transfer paths [127 ].     8.5 Biochar from sluggish pyrolysis of durian tree wood sawdust 8.5.1 Production of biochar The biochar sawdust was produced specifically for use in the slow pyrolysis process. WS occurred in a stainless-steel batch reactor with a height of 11 cm and an inner diameter of 6.5 cm. A 0.05 cm diameter orifice was created in the center of the reactor to alleviate excess pressure. The reactor was hermetically sealed with a metal cover and subjected to a continuous nitrogen gas flow from a nitrogen cylinder [121 ].  8.5.2 Analytical procedures The unprocessed and labeled biochar samples were combined with a CHN. A thermogravimetric analysis coupled with a differential thermal analyzer was used to measure the thermal stability of these samples in the presence of a nitrogen flow rate of 10 mL/min. In the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) approach, each sample weighing 5 mg was subjected to a heating rate of 10 °C/min until it reached a temperature of 1100 °C. Initially, 2 g of biochar was combined with 40 mL of deionized water and left to mix for approximately 30 min. The sample was authorized to rest for only 15 min before the recording procedure. The biochar and deionized water are subjected to continuous agitation for 24 h. The surface functional groups of the biochar and raw wood sawdust were quantified using FT-IR. The test samples were prepared to create a transparent disc by combining the biochar with KBr in a predetermined ratio. The FT-IR spectra were measured within the frequency range of 400–4000 cm−1  [121 ,128 ,129 ].   8.6 Biochar in medical and veterinary areas 8.6.1 Biochar as a digestive drug Biochar can potentially serve as a dietary supplement for both animals and humans. Activated biochar, derived from biomass processing, serves as a veterinary medication for treating toxicity and dyspepsia. Charcoal has long been renowned as an effective emergency therapy for mitigating toxicity in animals. It is still utilized due to its exceptional capacity to absorb plant toxins, mycotoxins, pesticides, toxic metabolites, and infections [46 ]. Firstly, adsorption involves binding amines, proteins, and amino acids to activated carbon, which significantly impacts the removal of many toxins, particularly in the gastrointestinal system [61 ,64 ,130 ,131 ]. The process of bacterial exoenzymes being adsorbed and the adsorption of digestive tract enzymes. Furthermore, the process of mobile germs binding by chemotaxis. The colonized biochar can directly absorb these toxins when gram-negative bacteria die off. The selective colonization of biochar with gram-negative bacteria can reduce the release of endotoxins [132 ,133 ].   8.7 Biochar in wastewater treatment Biochar has been utilized as a means to extract heavy metals from contaminated water. The valence state of the specific metal at different pH levels determines the elimination mechanism. One of the four dominant processes for removing heavy metal ions from wastewater using biochar is electrostatic attraction between the surface area of the biochar and the heavy metals. Furthermore, ion exchange occurs between heavy metal ions, alkali or alkaline earth metal ions, and even protons on the surface of biochar. Furthermore, the analysis involves considering the presence of surface functional groups or regions with an abundance of π-electrons [134–136 ].   9 Economic impacts of biochar on global carbon cycle To ensure the economic efficiency of Biochar, the increased yield resulting from its application must generate enough profit to cover the associated expenditures [137 ]. The viability of the biochar economy is contingent upon several factors, such as the acquisition of feedstock, transportation, production and heating technology, production scale, distribution, and overall management [138 ]. Overcoming economic issues quickly appears complex, as indicated by several data on these specific criteria. Field et al. determined that carbon sequestration costs are often too high to make a profit when using locally available feedstock [139 ]. Researchers observed that the projected economic advantages of Biochar are insufficient to justify its high price, considering the average rate of improvement and present pricing. According to Galinato et al. and Granatstein et al., biochar production models would benefit from incentives of USD 36.63 per ton of CO2  sequestration (adjusted for November 2015) as long as the feedstock prices do not exceed USD 25.64 per ton [139 ,140 ]. Again, Galinato et al. [139 ,140 ], established that the economic feasibility of incorporating Biochar into the soil depends on the price below USD 14.65 per metric tons. In a separate study, Roberts et al.,  [141 ] identified the distance of transportation as a constraint on the profitability of Biochar considered the distance of transit responsible for biochar profitability as a limitation in another investigation. Fig. 7   shows a flow diagram that gives an overall idea regarding the biochar recycling process, an essential factor for cost-effectiveness [142 ]. A few data on biochar application that discloses the cost, profit, and revenue from various research are noted below.i. Bach et al. projected that USD 1.57 Mg ha−1  of biochar for commercial crops, with a quantity of USD 1.77 percent to 10.74 Mg ha−1  [144 ]  ii. According to Singh et al. the research indicates that biochar is too costly, particularly when considering applications ranging from 5 to 20 Mg ha−1  [145 ]  iii. The addition of biochar to the soil would increase the profit margin by 21%, which will greatly improve the social and economic situation of impoverished farmers in Nepal. Currently, 25% of Nepal's rural families live below the poverty line [146 ]. Household revenues every year are average < 1000 US$ [147 ].  iv. The yearly household income is less than $1000. Research conducted by Galinato et al. found that using 73.63 tons of soil for wheat cultivation led to a 58 percent increase in the total income of 1,741,44 ha-1 from wheat crop yields, considering the price of wheat in 2012 [137 ].  v. In a report, Kulyk estimated that if we use wheat that costs USD 0.28 kg−1 , the revenues will go up from USD 1098.84 ha-1  to USD 1741 ha−1 .    The analysis also differentiated the advantages of two distinct scenarios (low-end and high-end) based on the pricing. Based on the data shown in Table 1   and Table 2   of the study, it is evident that the low-end scenario results in an economic loss of USD 5771.51. In contrast, the high-end scenario is significantly more lucrative, generating a revenue of USD 8322.02. The prices cited in this research are based on data from 2012 and are subject to fluctuation over time.  10 High and low-end scenarios Private costs refer to the expenses a farmer incurred while buying and applying one ton of biochar. Personal advantages refer to the monetary gains a farmer typically obtains from the increased wheat production from using biochar in the soil. Social costs refer to the expenses incurred by society and the environment because of the actions of a party directly responsible for economic activity. Social benefits refer to the positive outcomes that arise for society and the environment due to a particular economic activity. These benefits are generated by individuals who indirectly contribute to the well-being of society and the environment, simultaneously or separately [138 ]. It is essential to consider the absence of economic efficiency to evaluate carbon sequestration compared to other options for reducing CO2  (144). Kulyk et al. (2012) [138 ] demonstrate that using biochar significantly enhances its profitability in private settings by including a long-term analysis of plant productivity and soil fertility. Simultaneously, including short-term CO2  sequestration payment was also crucial in ensuring the economic feasibility of biochar. The average carbon credit value on the European Energy Exchange 2015 was around USD 8.75 per metric ton of CO2 , equivalent to nearly USD 2.40 per metric ton of carbon. Integrating biochar into the trading mechanism does not significantly enhance economic circumstances for using CO2  pricing to remove it from the environment [148 ]. An ineffective biochar technique is one possible approach to decrease the overall CO2  emissions in society. Economists will undoubtedly debate whether the cost of implementing a subsidized biochar method for carbon reduction should be higher than that of the most cost-effective carbon reduction measures, such as thermal insulation of buildings or combined power and heat systems, considering the political push for national carbon reduction and changes in climate mitigation strategies. Another research by Pandit et al. stated that minimizing manufacturing costs and providing sufficient supply in the market to reduce price levels is essential [148 ].  11 Biochar in sustainable development 11.1 Eradication of poverty and hunger Biochar usage in sustainable land management promotes poverty reduction by enhancing soil fertility and quality, lowering reliance on inputs, and increasing profits. Sustainable activities serve as an incentive for producers to improve profitability. Considering climate change, biochar systems can contribute to environmental benefits as poverty reduction efforts progress. Poverty reduction only occurs through climate change mitigation once ecological benefits are realized or internalized [149 ]. The issue can be resolved by implementing sustainable land practices using Biochar. This approach addresses climate change by sequestering carbon in charred substances and efficiently utilizing the carbon energy from pyrolysis byproducts in biochar systems [28 ,150 ,[23 ]]. Climate change mitigation can establish stable climatic patterns, prevent undesirable situations, and enhance land management practices [151 ,152 ]. Biochar has the potential to enhance soil fertility, bolster plant resistance against diseases, facilitate environmental restoration, and mitigate the effects of climate change. Approximately 46%, 54%, and 61% of the total additives in P, C, K, and N can be retrieved by soil modification with biochar. By combusting biochar alongside seed and rice straw, the reliance on chemical fertilizer for wheat processing can be reduced [153 ,154 ]. The soil's pH would decrease by 0.9 units. However, the organic matter content rose by 0.67%. Applying biochar in paddy fields in temperate and subtropical countries has enhanced rice production. This is due to the combined effect of biochar and NPK fertilizer treatments, which results in a drop in soil pH and a synergistic rise in crop yields [155–157 ]. In addition, applying biochar at rates of 5 t/ha, together with chemical additives of 67, 74, 42, and 4.5 t/ha, resulted in the maximum crop yields for brinjal, tomato, cauliflower, and chili, respectively. Using 5 tons per hectare of biochar is a potential approach for successful land management [157 ].  11.2 Good health and well-being The utilization of Biochar (a substance that may remove harmful, dangerous substances) in treating soil has been demonstrated to dramatically reduce the health risks associated with consuming vegetables grown in that soil. This risk reduction is measured by indicators such as the target risk quotient (THQ), the target risk of cancer (TCR), and the average daily intake (ADI). The research indicates a decrease in THQ levels for certain PTEs: Pb (86%), Ni (95%), Cr (43%), Cu (63%), Zn (84%), and Cd (95%). Biochar is a substance that provides essential nutrients and increases the ability of soil to support life. Biochar inputs have varying effects on soil nutrient levels. Biochar offers direct and indirect advantages by increasing nutrient concentrations, reducing PTE levels, and improving production efficiency [158,159 ].  11.3 Clean Water and Sanitation Biochar, with its notable capacity to remove various contaminants from liquid solutions, is an underutilized approach for treating drinking water [160 ]. The treatment may offer distinct advantages compared to traditional low-cost methods (such as sand filtration, heating, solar chlorination, and disinfection).(1) Biochar is a sustainable adsorbent with a minimal charge derived from readily available resources such as biomaterials. This makes it well-suited for use in economically disadvantaged regions [161 ].  (2) Existing methods mainly focus on eradicating diseases, while biochar effectively eliminates chemical, biological, and physical contaminants.  (3) Current methods produce carcinogenic byproducts, such as chloroform, through processes like boiling. However, biochar maintains the sensory properties of water without compromising its safety [162–164 ].     11.4 Affordable clean energy Biochar materials have been employed in laboratory settings as anodic materials for fuel and Sodium-ion dry cells. Graphite is used as an anode material in commercial Lithium-ion batteries [165 ]. By modifying the surface characteristics, including porosity, and introducing microscopic variations, the morphology and nanostructure of these biochar and carbon nanomaterials serve as attractive anodes for achieving improved electrochemical performance. Moreover, producing intricate carbon structures from biomasses, such as hard and soft carbon, is highly sought as an anode material for Sodium-ion cells or batteries. This material allows for improved insertion/extraction of ions and storage in challenging areas [166 ]. Additionally, incorporating heteroatoms into biochar alters the non-faradaic charge storage in Lithium-ion and Sodium-ion batteries, leading to a significantly enhanced specific capacity of this carbon material generated from biomass [167 ]. Biochar can function as a cathode support and diffusion layer in metal-air cells, substantially reducing the operational lifespan of Lithium-air and Zinc-air cells or batteries [168 ,169 ].  11.5 Greenhouse gas mitigation (GHG) The rapid increase in GHG emissions worldwide in recent decades has created a pressing need to explore affordable and sustainable technology to reduce GHG output and promote the absorption of carbon in soil [170 ]. GHGs can be reduced by adding biochar to the soil, which helps to store carbon in a stable form when organic matter breaks down. Biochar, a solid carbonaceous product resulting from the pyrolysis of biomass, has emerged as an effective, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective method for attaining sustainable development objectives [171 ,172 ]. The IPCC report of 2018 designates biochar as a very promising negative emission technology (NET). The exceptional functionality of biochar, characterized by its physical attributes such as porosity, extensive surface area, and remarkable water-holding capacity, along with its chemical properties such as the abundance of oxygen-containing functional groups, surface charge, and pH-modulating effect, indicates its potential for reducing GHG emissions [173 ]. Furthermore, the effectiveness of pure biochar in reducing GHGs emissions in large-scale applications remains uncertain. The extensive diversity in biochar is determined by the multitude of parameters involved in the thermochemical conversion of organic biomass [174–176 ]. This review aims to evaluate the primary variables that could hinder the effectiveness of biochar in mitigating GHG emissions. Biochar has a strong capacity for storing carbon in soil due to its high carbon content, especially when the ratio of oxygen to carbon is less than 0.2. It also contains aromatic structures and active functional groups, which make it resistant to decomposition in soil [177 ]. The carbon footprint of biochar varies from 0.04 tCO2eq (net emissions) to 1.67 tCO2eq per t of biomass (net reduction) depending on factors such as the kind of feedstock, system boundaries, and methods used in life cycle assessment studies [178 ]. Biochar plays a crucial role in regulating the pore structure characteristics of soil, such as porosity, pore size distribution, connectedness, anisotropy, and fractal dimension. This process is highly effective in reducing CO2  emissions [179 ,180 ]. It is necessary to use effective management measures, such as the application of biochar, in temperate forests. This is because approximately 70% of the carbon fluxes worldwide are produced by respiration [181 ]. The modulation of respiration in temperate forests may optimize the carbon storage in the soil matrix. Applying bamboo leaf biochar at rates of 5 and 10 Mg ha−1  resulted in a significant increase in carbon stock in moso bamboo forest. Specifically, the carbon stock rose by around 486% and 253% respectively, as reported in study [182 ]. Therefore, biochar is one of the most important key element to remove GHG from the atmosphere.  11.6 Sustainable cities and communities Stormwater drainage, green roofs, and urban tree planting have also benefited from Biochar. It can even be used to clean up urban brownfields. The storage and stability of carbon is the most straightforward and essential aspect of climate change mitigation efforts using Biochar [169 ]. Indirect factors that contribute to the reduction of pollution include (a) the production of environmentally friendly energy through the combustion of gas (known as “syngas”) as a byproduct of biochar synthesis; (b) diverting waste, which prevents the release of methane (CH4 ) and nitrous oxide (N2 O) emissions from decomposing waste; and (c) reducing the production of fertilizers. The potential for a detrimental climatic impact resulting from Biochar is mainly attributed to unfavorable feedback mechanisms that may arise either directly or indirectly during the production and application of Biochar. Such hazards include CH4  and N2 O emissions from inadequate pyrolysis and soil organic matter loss due to biochar application on inappropriate soils [63 ,183 ,184 ]. Moreover, wood cook stoves significantly produce black carbon, which has far-reaching consequences for the environment and human well-being. Biochar possesses a notable advantage in that it is among the limited choices for reducing GHG emissions that can effectively extract carbon dioxide from the environment. However, the comprehensive impact of Biochar on the climate can only be accurately assessed by a life-cycle analysis [184 ]. By assessing and applying biochar, the global carbon cycle could be reduced to a minimum, and climate action would favor a greener environment. Biochar will enhance land life through reclamation, remediation, and regeneration [185 ,186 ].   12 Future prospects and sustainability development In recent decades, the prominence of biochar has been steadily growing. The progress in this field will undoubtedly revolutionize the globe as it unfolds. Biochar possesses utility from its production process to its subsequent use. They can potentially address significant global issues such as climate change, food shortages, and waste disposal. Adopting biochar-making stoves on a large scale will reduce the quantity of biomass utilized for cooking, hence mitigating deforestation and decreasing CO2  emissions [187 ]. The California Energy Commission's Public Interest Energy Research program has aided with researching biomass projects that might be considered GHG offsets. This program essentially allows for substituting biochar sequestration in return for CO2  emissions from fossil fuels, which are otherwise limited [188 ,189 ]. This investment assumes biochar can cut the world's yearly GHG emissions by 12%. An American non-profit organization focuses on providing financial support for climate solutions to utilities, governments, and major enterprises. It operates under the assumption that 80% of the biochar emissions will persist in the soil for 100 years [152 ]. The soil's pH, nutrient availability, moisture, and organic content benefit the soil. Biochar exerts a beneficial influence. A meta-analysis has found that the utilization of biochar has led to a 10 percent augmentation in the mean crop output. Nevertheless, some studies have demonstrated a boost in plant growth of up to 100 percent. There is a prevailing belief that biochar can sometimes decrease the requirement for fertilizers. It fulfills the dual function of absorbing and enhancing water aeration using insecticides and fertilizers [190 ,191 ]. It mitigates the leaching of herbicides and subsequent water body pollution by promoting the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons and their immobilization in the soil. This method additionally diminishes the presence of heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the soil, along with mitigating their detrimental impacts on plants [112 ,192 ]. Biochar can reduce mycotoxin production, bind to pesticides, impede butyric acid generation, and, when used with silage, enhance the lactic bacteria population. Using biochar as a supplement in animal feed can improve animal well-being, overall productivity, and feed utilization. Using biochar with straw or sawdust bedding resulted in a 5–10% decrease in hoof disease among farmers. This reduction in hoof disease led to decreased odors and nutrient losses. Adding 0.1% biochar (by mass) to the fluid manure pit led to increased odors, the development of a top crust, and a decrease in nutritional content. Magnetite is subjected to ball milling to grind magnetite particles. Biochar is a method that is both environmentally friendly and economically efficient in the production of inexpensive magnetic adsorbents. This will help address future environmental problems [193 ]. Rural families and companies can utilize various energy devices to generate electricity from the combustion of gases and heat produced by the gasification of agricultural leftovers. Considering the usual abundance of biomass in studies involving various uses and reported calorific values of residues ranging from 12.6 to 17.7 MJkg−1 , the potential energy yield from croplands with a rotation of sorghum, maize, millet, groundnut, and monocrop rice was calculated to be between 10 and 51 GJ ha−1  yr−1  [194 ]. According to a study by Stockholm Exergies. Biochar was assigned a price equivalent to carbon (2000 SEK/ton), resulting in competitive prices for heat generation and a favorable merit order. The commencement of operations for these plants was scheduled for 2025 [195 ]. Due to biochar's remarkably low thermal conductivity and capacity to absorb water up to 6 times its weight, it is a practical material for insulating buildings and regulating humidity. Biochar can be utilized with lime, clay, and cement mortar, effectively substituting up to 50% of the sand in lime and concrete mixtures. Indoor plasters are highly insulated and permeable, effectively maintaining humidity levels in space at a consistent range of 45–70% during summer and winter. This measure prevents too-dry air, which can exacerbate allergies and respiratory conditions, and the accumulation of moist air that can cause condensation on walls and promote mold growth. When used as biochar mud plaster, Biochar is a very efficient substance that can absorb electromagnetic waves, protecting against “electrosmog” [196 ]. Generally, Biochar may be utilized to meet our essential everyday needs and improve many techniques. The potential applications of Biochar are expanding, and the existing domains where it is used are being improved. Further study has the potential to provide high-quality Biochar at a reduced manufacturing cost, paving the way for a more secure future.  13 Conclusions The rotational cultivation of biochar has been associated with human civilization since the Paleolithic period. Undoubtedly, biochar confers advantages to almost all living things, including flora and the environment. Despite the substantial amount of research conducted in biochar since the turn of the twenty-first century, there are still some concerns regarding its full utilization. The efficacy of walnut-shell biochar (WSB) in isolation or in combination with nanoscale zerovalent iron (WSB-nZVI) to eliminate cadmium (Cd) from an aqueous solution is influenced by four distinct variables. Biochar can be advantageous, contingent upon various factors, including transportation production scale, production technology, feedstock accumulation, temperature, and distribution methodology. Biochar can be beneficial for treatment, specifically maladies can be eradicated through utilization of biochar. As a potential technique for eliminating heavy metal ions from wastewater, biochar has demonstrated high efficiency in purifying wastewater. In conjunction with effective nutrient management, biochar has been shown to increase crop yields very effectively. Furthermore, biochar liberates energy available for harvesting during its production process, pyrolysis. Biochar can reduce atmospheric carbon emissions, which can influence global warming as well as climate change.  Funding information No specific fund was received to support this work.
