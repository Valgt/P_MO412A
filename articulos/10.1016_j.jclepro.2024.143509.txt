                  The sustainability of cities determines human sustainable development. Human settlement is an important element of cities, and scientific monitoring and assessment of it can help cities accurately identify unsustainable issues. Taking Sustainable Development Goal 11 as the basic framework, the study constructs a global development goal-oriented sustainability assessment system for urban human settlement (UHS), including 7 fields and 26 indicators, which serves as a reference for cities globally. And an empirical analysis is conducted using panel data of 143 typical cities in China from 2015 to 2019. The results show that: (1) the score of China's UHS sustainability improved from 54.84 to 58.52, with some cities already achieving the goal of sustainable UHS. More than 50% of the cities were on track to achieve the goal by 2030. (2) Regional scores varied, being higher in the south and lower in the north, with the highest score in the eastern coastal region and the lowest score in the northeastern region. (3) Economy size is significantly and positively correlated with UHS sustainability, which is consistent with the regional performance, but with a marginal decreasing trend. (4) The performance of cities with different population size varied more significantly. The scores of UHS sustainability showed a U-shaped relationship with population size. In response to these findings, this study proposes corresponding strategic measures. The insights gained from the empirical analysis of Chinese cities can inform global policymaking.

Handling Editor: Giovanni Baiocchi The sustainability of cities determines human sustainable development. Human settlement is an important element of cities, and scientific monitoring and assessment of it can help cities accurately identify unsustainable issues. Taking Sustainable Development Goal 11 as the basic framework, the study constructs a global development goal-oriented sustainability assessment system for urban human settlement (UHS), including 7 fields and 26 indicators, which serves as a reference for cities globally. And an empirical analysis is conducted using panel data of 143 typical cities in China from 2015 to 2019. The results show that: (1) the score of China's UHS sustainability improved from 54.84 to 58.52, with some cities already achieving the goal of sustainable UHS. More than 50% of the cities were on track to achieve the goal by 2030. (2) Regional scores varied, being higher in the south and lower in the north, with the highest score in the eastern coastal region and the lowest score in the northeastern region. (3) Economy size is significantly and positively correlated with UHS sustainability, which is consistent with the regional performance, but with a marginal decreasing trend. (4) The performance of cities with different population size varied more significantly. The scores of UHS sustainability showed a U-shaped relationship with population size. In response to these findings, this study proposes corresponding strategic measures. The insights gained from the empirical analysis of Chinese cities can inform global policymaking.

The global urban population has grown from 30% in 1950 to 55% today, with projections suggesting it will reach 70% by 2050 (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2019 ). This rapid urbanization presents significant environmental, social, and economic challenges. Environmental issues are particularly pressing, contributing to climate change and public and personal health risks exacerbation (Manisalidis et al., 2020 ; Liang and Gong, 2020 ). Economically and socially, cities face challenges including inequality, poverty, housing shortages, unemployment, and social exclusion (Yuan et al., 2020 ). As a result of these problems, cities face enormous challenges in terms of institution building and governance (Evans, 2019 ; Escorcia-Hernández et al., 2023 ). The critical role of cities in sustainable development is underscored by their central position in numerous interconnected planning issues (Angelo and Wachsmuth, 2020 ; Parnell, 2016 ). Recognizing this, the UN included urban development as a separate goal - Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG11) - in the document entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” (the 2030 Agenda) to build inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable cities (United Nations, 2015 ). However, challenges such as climate crises, epidemics, and conflicts have exacerbated poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation, thereby complicating the achievement of urban sustainable development (Naidoo and Fisher, 2020 ). Unmeasured is unmanageable. Urban sustainability assessment is an important tool to promote the achievement of sustainable development. It can help localities develop and implement sustainable development policies in different contexts and to support urban management and monitoring. It has therefore become a hot area of research and practice, attracting the attention of many institutions and scholars. Based on the Global SDG Indicators Framework proposed by the UN, the SDG Index and Dashboards were used to assess the progress of SDGs at the city level in different countries, such as the 100 most populous cities in the US, and 45 capital cities and metropolitan areas in the European Union and European Free Trade Association countries (Lynch et al., 2019 ; Lafortune et al., 2019 ). The International Organization for Standardization Technical Committee on Sustainable Urban Development (ISO/TC 268) published more than 30 international standards containing management system standards, evaluation standards, and corresponding tools, guidelines and technical methods for sustainable urban development (Yang, 2019 ). Research on urban sustainability assessment has yielded a variety of tools and methods aimed at evaluating sustainable development. A prevalent approach involves constructing indicator systems that consider economic, social, and environmental dimensions (Yi et al., 2019 ; Zinatizadeh et al., 2017 ). For example, Li et al. (2024)  constructed an urban sustainable development evaluation system for urban renewal, including 38 indicators for 7 elements, and made an empirical analysis with Shanghai. The ecological footprint method is also widely used; Li et al. (2022b)  and Peng et al. (2018)  applied this method to measure eco-efficiency and economic sustainability using modified indices and multiple indicators. And various models have been created to assess urban sustainability. Nong et al. (2024)  proposed a framework of urban eco-efficiency by using the Super Slacks-Based Measure model, and calculated the urban eco-efficiency of 284 prefecture-level cities in China from 2005 to 2022. Purvis et al. (2021)  adapted World3 model to form a multiscale integrated assessment model, capturing the interactions within and between urban subsystems. While these studies contributed to a more comprehensive understanding of urban sustainability, overly broad assessments might obscure key issues. In addition, although most assessment were constructed around sustainability dimensions, the concept of urban sustainable development under this framework was very broad and did not dovetail with the global development goals (Kaur and Garg, 2019 ; Yi et al., 2022 ). This highlights the need for an assessment framework consistent with global urban development requirements to measure progress and issues in sustainable urban development. Such a framework would also solve the problems of fuzzy focus and poor comparability of existing research. Urban human settlement (UHS) is the combination of elements in a city that is most closely related to human activities, and its core idea is the concept of human-centeredness. A sustainable UHS can satisfy people's living and working needs (Xiong, 2011 ), rationally utilize resources and protect the environment (Xu et al., 2016 ), withstand disaster risks (Demuzere et al., 2014 ), thus improving the quality of human life (You et al., 2020 ) and realizing the harmonious coexistence of human and nature (Guo et al., 2023 ). The sustainable development of UHS is vital, as emphasized by the 1996 Habitat Agenda and the 2030 Agenda, which advocate for inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities. The New Urban Agenda (NUA) reinforced this, aiming to ensure all inhabitants of present and future generations to inhabit and build equity, safe, healthy, accessible, affordable, resilient, and sustainable cities and human settlement (Effat et al., 2022 ). Consequently, this study chooses to further focus on the issue of sustainable urban development by using the human settlement as the point for studying urban sustainable development. To this end, the study proposes a conceptual framework which describes the sustainability of UHS, by identifying the requirements of documents about cities development, such as the 2030 Agenda and the NUA. Based on the conceptual framework, a systematic methodology to assessing the sustainability of UHS is introduced, covering seven fields and 26 variables, and utilizing a development-based “Donut Model” to determine variable thresholds. Finally, 143 Chinese cities are selected for empirical research to verify the feasibility of the methodology, and the level and characteristics of UHS sustainability in China from 2015 to 2019 are explored, with differentiation analysis used to suggest countermeasures for sustainable development in Chinese and world cities. This study fills the existing research gaps in two aspects. (1) It constructs a UHS sustainability assessment system that is consistent with the global development goals and provides a pathway for the dissemination of the SDGs from the global level to the local level, which dovetails with the issue of unsustainable urban development and is more concerned with human settlement issues. As the goals of global urban development are clear, the results obtained based on this framework are comparable to some extent. (2) It reveals the relationship between the sustainability of UHS and city-scale. This is important as it helps policymakers understand the fields of focus for UHS with different characteristics, providing valuable insights for policy makers and stakeholders interested in improving the sustainability of UHS. This manuscript is organized as follows. After this introduction, the method is briefly described in Section 2 . The results and discussion are presented in Section 3  and Section 4 . In Section 5 , the conclusions are summarized.  2 Methods 2.1 Construction of assessment indicator system 2.1.1 Framework construction Fig. 1   shows the construction idea of the assessment indicator system. The study adopts SDG11 as the basic framework for assessment and combines the further requirements of the NUA for urban construction and evaluation needs. Moreover, based on existing studies, such as the mature international CPI evaluation (Wong, 2015 ), the standards on sustainable urban development developed by the ISO/TC 268 (Yang, 2019 ), and the UN-Habitat progress evaluation report for Goal 11 (United Nations Human Settlements Programme, 2018 ), this study reorganizes the targets of SDG11 and includes other relevant SDGs for appropriate extension and refinement. The field of basic quality of life is added, considering the function of cities as important gathering places for human beings and the principle of people-centered development. Considering that mitigation of the impact of urban disasters is usually achieved through urban planning and management, disaster reduction is merged into the field of urban planning and management. Ultimately, the evaluation system for sustainable UHS is divided into seven major fields: housing guarantee, sustainable transportation, human settlement management, heritage protection, basic quality of life, environmental protection, and livable public space (see Table 1  ).  2.1.2 Indicator selection principles and process After systematically reviewing the existing indicators for SDG11, UHS and sustainability evaluation, and other studies (Zhang et al., 2021 ; Abubakar and Aina, 2019 ; Gao et al., 2021b ; Sachs et al., 2021 ), indicators are selected based on the following principles, guided by the United Nations Global SDG Indicator Framework methodology: (1) Be scientific. Indicators should be measurable and practical, with clear definitions, subjective descriptions, and scientific measurement methods. (2) Relevance. Indicators should be able to reflect the global development positioning and goals of the city, and be relevant enough to the assessment area to form a policy-oriented, systematic and targeted evaluation. (3) Reliability and continuity of data acquisition. To ensure the accuracy of the evaluation, the data collection and processing is based on valid and reliable statistical methods. All aggregated indicators are initially screened, eliminating those lacking scientific validity or reliable data. The remaining indicators with similar connotations are further filtered using frequency statistics, retaining those with higher generality to form the assessment base indicator database. A consultation questionnaire is then distributed to relevant experts and researchers, including descriptions of the UHS sustainability assessment fields and indicators from the database. Respondents rate their willingness to suggest each indicator on a scale of 0–5. The average score of each indicator from the valid responses is calculated, and 26 high-scoring indicators are selected (see Table 1 ), taking into account the requirement of comprehensiveness of the assessment content in each area and the balance of the number of indicators. The indicators are detailed in Table S1. Since the indicator system is based on the SDG11 framework, the selection process follows the Global SDG Indicator Framework methodology, ensuring global applicability and comparability.   2.2 Assessment method The UHS sustainability score is calculated in two steps (see Fig. 2  ). The first step is to calculate the indicator score by improved normalization after determining the indicator thresholds. The second step is to calculate the field scores from the indicator scores through equal weight aggregation, and then use the same method to obtain the UHS sustainability scores.Step 1.  Calculate of indicator score.    Referring to the existing studies, the improved outlier normalization method is used to calculate the indicator scores. This method mainly uses the maximum and minimum values in the original data of the index for calculation, as shown in Equation (1) ,(1) x ′  = x  −  min ( x )   max ( x )  − min ( x )        where x    represents the original data, max ( x )     and min ( x )     represent the indicator's maximum and minimum values, respectively, and x ′     represents the value after rescaling. To more accurately measure progress, the maximum and minimum values are replaced with the best and worst indicator values. Thresholds are based on the “Donut Model” of economics, which defines a “social base” for essential human needs and an “ecological ceiling” for planetary boundaries. Development beyond the ceiling is unsafe, while development below the floor is inadequate. For urban development indicators, thresholds are unidirectional when the city is inside or outside the inner or outer circles, as cities must aim for the “middle circle”—the safe development space between the ceiling and floor. When a city crosses the border towards the middle circle, the indicator threshold becomes a tolerance zone. Exceeding this zone puts the city in a precarious state, risking a breach of safe development boundaries. Currently, China's cities are in a growth phase beyond the base, where indicator thresholds are unidirectional. Table 2   outlines the rules for determining upper bounds for each indicator in various situations. The principle of “leaving no one behind” from the 2030 Agenda guides the determination of these upper limits (Butcher et al., 2021 ), drawing on practical experiences from SDG progress assessments. After excluding 2.5% of the worst-performing observations of all cities, the remaining values are used as the lower limit, considering sensitivity to outliers. After establishing the upper and lower bounds, a linear transformation of the variables in the range [0, 100] is performed by applying Equation (2) ,(2) x ′  = x − min ′  ( x )   max ′  ( x )  − min ′  ( x )        where x    is the raw data value, max ′  ( x )     and min ′  ( x )     denote the best and worst values determined for the indicator, respectively, and x ′     is the indicator score. Some cities may perform better than the best-case scenario under certain circumstances, in which case the score of this indicator remains 100. Similarly, cities that perform worse than the worst-case scenario have a score of zero. Thus, the rescaled data are easily interpreted and compared across all indicators. A score of 100 indicates that the desired goal of the indicator has been achieved. If the upper limit of the indicator is determined using the average of the top five, a score of 100 indicates only the level of achievement that can reasonably be expected in the current context.Step 2.  Calculate of sustainability score.    Equal weights are assigned to each field and indicator. As part of the 2030 Agenda, all SDGs are of equal importance, and the assessment framework for this study is constructed based on SDG11, which requires the retention of this principle. Therefore, it is justified to use equal weighting at the field level. The equal weighting at the indicator level is due to the apparent limitations of other weight determination methods. They are divided into objective methods, including principal component analysis (PCA) and entropy weighting method (EWM), and subjective methods such as expert consultation and flexible weighting (Yi et al., 2019 ). Using PCA to determine weights requires correlations between indicators, which may not be satisfied in this study. The EWM determines weights by the degree of data variation, it tends to ignore indicators that perform poorly and are difficult to improve, which often need to be focused on and improved (Zhu et al., 2020 ). Subjectively determined indicator weights are not agreed upon. Therefore, the study uses equal weights at the indicator level. The following equations show the specific weighting and aggregate approach,(3) I i  = ∑ j = 1  N i j    1 N i j    I i j   ,     (4) I = ∑ i = 1  N i   1 N i   I i  .     where N i j      denotes the number of indicators contained within the field i  of each city, I i j      denotes the score of indicator j  within the field i , I i     denotes the score of the field i , N i     denotes the number of fields, for which a city has data, and I    denotes the UHS sustainability score of a city. Referring to the evaluation methods of the SDG Index and Dashboards (Sachs et al., 2018 ), the UHS sustainability status is classified into four categories (see Table 3  ).  2.3 Analyses method 2.3.1 Analysis and forecast of development trends Using historical data, the study estimates how fast a city has progressed toward the goal of UHS sustainable development and determined whether – if extrapolated into the future – this pace will be sufficient to achieve such a goal by 2030. The linear annual growth rate needed to achieve the goal from the evaluation starting year to 2030 is calculated and compare to the average annual growth rate over the recent period (Sachs et al., 2021 ). Fig. 2  illustrates the rules for determining development trends. The development trend is categorized into four states: decreasing, stagnating, moderately improving, and on track. Decreasing means reducing the score that the city moves in the wrong direction. Stagnating indicates that the score remains stagnant or increases at a rate below 50% of the growth rate needed to achieve the goal by 2030. Moderately improving indicates that the score increases at a rate above 50% of the required growth rate, but below the rate needed to achieve the goal by 2030. On track means that the development is on track or the goal achievement is being maintained.  2.3.2 Impact analysis of city-scale The sustainability of UHS is affected by population and economic development. People are the main body of human settlement system. Population is related to the fundamental change of human settlement, and its size naturally affects UHS scores (Xue et al., 2021 ). On the other hand, economy is an important dimension of urban development, and every part of the city is closely related to its level, including the living environment (Zhang et al., 2022 ). Therefore, this study aims to better examine the sustainability characteristics of the UHS and make recommendations by identifying the relationship between the city's economy and population size and the sustainability of the UHS. The Chinese government has already classified cities according to population size and formulated policies accordingly. Considering the practicability of the research results, urban population size is divided into five categories based on existing practice to study the impact of urban population scale on sustainability of UHS: cities with a resident population of <1 million are Small and Medium-sized Cities, and cities with a resident population of >1 million and <5 million are Large Cities. Among the latter, cities with 3–5 million residents are Type I Large Cities, and cities with 1–3 million are Type II Large. Cities with a resident population of >5 million and <10 million are Metropolis, and cities with a resident population of >10 million are Mega-cities. In studying the impact of cities’ economic sizes, the panel data regression analysis is conducted with the scores of the evaluated cities as the explained variables and the economic scale indicator of the evaluated cities as the explaining variables (Tang et al., 2017 ). The regression models usually involve the Pooled OLS regression model (POOL model), fixed-effects model (FEM), and random-effects model (REM) (Gao et al., 2022 ). For detailed descriptions and equations of the three models, see Supplementary Information. In the selection method of the panel data model form, usually using the F-test to compare FEM and the POOL model, a p -value of <0.05 implies that FEM is better, and vice versa. Using the LM test to compare REM and the POOL, a p -value of <0.05 implies that REM is better, and vice versa. Using the Hausman test to compare FEM and REM, a p -value of <0.05 implies that FEM is s better, and vice versa. To better investigate the relationship between the economy scale of cities and UHS sustainability, control variables need to be included. The IPAT model theory suggests that environmental impact is a function of population, affluence, and technology. The UHS belongs to the derived definition of environment, and its score can reflect the impact of human activities on them in reverse. The greater the impact, the lower the score. GDP per capita is often used as a proxy for urban affluence. Drawing on the theory of the IPAT model, population density, which represents the population, and total factor productivity, which represents the specific technology that supports the level of affluence, are chosen as control variables (Tang et al., 2017 ). To attenuate the heteroskedasticity of the data, GDP per capita, population density and total factor productivity are treated logarithmically. The regression equation is constructed as shown in Equation (5) ,(5) y s c o r e   = β 0  + β 1  L N G D P P C  i t   + β 2  L N P D  i t   + β 3  L N T F P  i t   + μ , i = 1 , … . , N , t = 1 , … , T     where L N G D P P C  i t     , L N P D  i t     , and L N T F P  i t      represent the logarithmic values of GDP per capita, population density and total factor productivity of city i  in year t , respectively.   2.4 Empirical area and data resource Based on data availability, 143 Chinese cities from 2015 to 2019 are included in the analysis, covering 26 provinces and four directed ministered municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing) (Table S2). The spatial distributions of the 143 sample cities of this study are shown in Fig. 3  . These cities include four directed ministered municipalities, 32 sub-provincial cities and provincial capitals, and 107 prefecture-level cities. Compared with cities in general, directed ministered municipalities, sub-provincial cities and provincial capitals have more advantages in terms of the policies and resources, with more significant factor agglomeration and economies of scale. Further, 107 prefecture-level cities are selected typically considering geographical distribution and their sustainable development base. These cities can better reflect the characteristics of Chinese cities in terms of UHS sustainability. The data are obtained mainly by manual query from the China City Statistical Yearbook, China Urban Construction Statistical Yearbook, and official public data, such as city statistical yearbooks, statistical bulletins on national economic and social development, and ecological and environmental status bulletins. Some indicator data are also sourced from websites, such as city official government websites, the China Economic and Social Big Data Research Platform, the China Carbon Emission Database, and the China House Price Quotes. The main sources of data for each indicator are shown in Table S1. Individually missing data are supplemented with appropriate computations using the method of averaging, index trend extrapolation, and interpolation.   3 Results 3.1 Overall situation Fig. 4   is created based on the overall and various fields of UHS sustainability in the participating cities. Fig. 4 (a) shows the normal distribution curve of the number of cities in each score band from 2015 to 2019, with the curve shifting rightward, indicating improved UHS sustainability in Chinese cities, and an average score increase of 6.69%. All cities progressed regardless of the starting status in 2015. The spacing on both sides of the normal curve over the years shows that the number of cities with lower scores decreased more, and the progress of them was relatively obvious. From 2015 to 2018, the distribution of scores by cities gradually disperses. This change is reflected mainly in the decrease and increase in the number of cities in the 45–50 and 60–65 score ranges, with a smaller decrease in the 55–60 range, where the distribution of the number of cities is more concentrated. However, the number of cities with 2019 scores of 55–70, especially in the 55–60 range, increases significantly. The average level of all participating cities improved less, indicating that the impact of low-scoring cities on the average score cannot be ignored despite their small number. Furthermore, the disparity between cities in UHS sustainability widened. Although more than 50% of the cities (e.g. Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture and Guyuan) were on track to achieve sustainable UHS development by 2030, nearly 14% of the participating cities had negative average annual growth rates, and 20 cities were regressing. Cities like Xiangtan, Changzhou, and Zhuzhou, categorized as “stagnating”, accounted for 19% of all cities and made minimal progress in UHS sustainability. Fig. 4 (b) shows the average score of each field, whose performance varies widely. The score of field A increased and then decreased. The score of field C fluctuated around 46.80, which was relatively stable. The scores of the remaining five fields increased. Particularly, field F performed the best, steadily progressing and always scoring the highest among all fields. Field D consistently scored the lowest among all fields. In addition, the performance of the top-ranked cities shows that sustainable development of urban UHS cannot be achieved without balanced development across all fields. A median scatterplot using the 2019 average score and the difference between the 2015 average score for each indicator is shown in Fig. 5  . About 35% of the indicators are in the first quadrant, with a high probability of achieving the target status by 2030. Indicators B3, E1, F2, and F3 were even in the goal achieved status, which is inextricably linked to China's poverty eradication efforts. The second quadrant shows that indicators A2, A3, C2, E5, F1, and F3 performed better in 2019, but regressed from 2015 to 2019, with all but A2 scoring above 70. Indicator A2 reflects a certain extent degree of real estate bubble in China's cities with the situation deteriorating. Indicators in the third and fourth quadrants have lower scores, and are difficult to achieve the goals. Among them, the scores of indicators B1, C1, and D2 declined with no effective improvement method, which is a significant obstacle to achieving the target. More indicators are in quadrant four with improved but lower scores.  3.2 Regional situation The overall pattern of the UHS sustainability scores in China was high in the south and low in the north, and there was a certain regional aggregation effect. To further study the characteristics of UHS sustainability in different regions of China, according to the existing strategies and studies, the 143 participating cities are divided into eight comprehensive regions: northeast, northern coastal, eastern coastal, southern coastal, mid-Yellow River, mid-Yangtze River, southwest, and northwest regions (Gao et al., 2021a ). The poor-performing cities were concentrated in the northeast, with fewer cities experiencing a breakthrough over the 5 years. The gap between the scores of central and western cities was large in 2015. However, western cities such as Leshan, Meishan and Luzhou, made more significant progress, and the difference of sustainable UHS development further narrowed in 2019. The scores and changes of the eight regions are shown in Fig. 6  . Overall progress occurred, but the progress of each region was uneven. The eastern coastal region had the highest score (63.48), the northeastern region had the lowest score (52.17) and the least progress, and four regions, including the northern coast, eastern coast, southern coast, and mid-Yellow River, had higher scores than the overall average. Except for the northwest region, the mean scores exceeded the median scores of all regions, indicating more fields of poorer performance. The northwest region had many fields whose scores were higher than the median. But the extremely low scores of field C and the lack of improvement limited the overall regional score improvement.  3.3 Analyses of the city-scale impact 3.3.1 Economy scale The impact analysis of economy scale is performed using STATA 16.0. The variables are first subjected to descriptive statistics, and the sample size, mean, standard deviation, and maximum and minimum values of the variables are presented in Table S3. To ensure the accuracy of the regression analysis, individuals (cities) with more missing data are excluded. The final sample of individuals was 137. The regression model is determined by testing, and the model test results are shown in Table S4. The FEM is finally selected. Table 4   shows the FEM calculation results. The natural logarithm of GDP per capita is significant at a level of 0.01 and a regression coefficient value of 6.177, which is larger in absolute value than the other two variables, indicating that the scale of the economy is the most influential of the three variables on the sustainability of UHS. This larger-than-zero coefficient also reflects the independent variable significantly affects the dependent variable positively. The UHS sustainability is, to some extent, influenced by the scale of the urban economy, and urban economic development has a positive effect on the improvement in the UHS sustainability. The relationship between the city economy scale and UHS sustainability can be more visually obtained by plotting Fig. 7  , based on the GDP per capita and the scores for each city from 2015 to 2019. In terms of average performance, cities with larger economies scored relatively higher, consistent with the panel data regression analysis results. Moreover, a certain marginal decreasing performance of the positive effect of economy scale on UHS sustainability scores occurred.  3.3.2 Population scale Fig. 8   presents UHS sustainability scores for cities of different sizes as well as their scores of each field from 2015 to 2019. It shows that cities of different sizes with various degrees trended upward in average sustainability scores, but the upward trend was insignificant. Cities of all sizes presented relatively noticeable differences in scores. The overall performance of Small and Medium-sized Cities was better, with higher scores than the other four categories from 2015 to 2018. Type I and Type II Large Cities improved the most, with scores improving by 10.17% and 6.16%, respectively. The best-performing cities in 2019 shifted to Mega-cities. Specifically, significant variability existed in the scores of different-sized cities' UHS fields. Scores of field A were more sensitive to population, with smaller-scale cities scoring relatively higher. The scores of field B didn't continue to decline with the population growth, but rather followed a downward and then upward trend. Small and Medium-sized Cities performed particularly well in field D, scoring much higher than other cities. However, in field C, the performance was poor, and the scores of indicators C2 and C3 were extremely low, significantly restricting the sustainable UHS development of Small and Medium-sized Cities. Larger cities generally had weaker performance in field D, mainly because of the high number of per capita indicators in this field. The main components to be examined include the number of scenic spots, intangible cultural heritage, nature reserves, and other natural and cultural heritage, which are related to the city's endowment conditions and generally similar among cities. Further, no dominant fields existed other than the generally better field F, leading to relatively poor overall UHS sustainability.    4 Discussion 4.1 Overall trends From 2015 to 2019, against the backdrop of an overall increase in global SDG11 scores (Sachs et al., 2023 ), the sustainability of China's UHS developed in an overall positive direction, which is consistent with the findings of Cong et al. (2021) . This is mainly due to the significant improvement in the quality of life of urban people. In 2020, China achieved total poverty eradication under the current standards, eliminating absolute poverty and achieving the SDG1 (No Poverty) 10 years ahead of schedule. However, the average progress of the participating cities in terms of the sustainability of UHS was relatively small, with nearly one-third of the cities experiencing lower or stagnant average annual growth rates. And there is a potential for further increase in the gap of sustainability of UHS between cities in the future. The performance of Chinese cities can serve as a reference for cities around the world. Firstly, further acceleration of urbanization with urban population growth eventually causes a decline in housing levels. The real estate bubbles are beginning to emerge, with a more pronounced impact on the lower-scoring cities, which are relatively weak in terms of the economic development and managerial capacity needed. Secondly, there is still a large gap in the field of natural and cultural heritage protection, which is a common problem faced by all countries in the world, especially developing countries. This is mainly due to the blurring of the boundaries of the area where the heritage belongs, unclear property rights, and the lack of unified planning and laws and regulations (Tu, 2020 ). Thirdly, the development of the high-performing cities in various fields is relatively balanced, while the low-scoring cities have different performances in various fields. If the low-scoring cities are unable to utilize their strengths to drive the development of their weaknesses, it will be difficult for them to improve scores, which will ultimately lead to a further widening of the gap between cities. To address these issues, cities should focus on their specific circumstances, addressing shortcomings to achieve balanced development. In terms of housing security, establishing a multi-principal supply system, multi-channel security, and combined rental and purchase models is essential. For natural heritage protection, it is necessary to clarify the boundaries of heritage protection, and to explore the use of digitization technology to carry out heritage monitoring on a regular basis.  4.2 Regional patterns and economic scale implications of UHS sustainability UHS development scores exhibits a pattern of being higher in the south and lower in the north, primarily due to regional economic differences, which was consistent with the findings of Xu et al. (2020)  and Meng et al., 2019 . Economically developed areas are better equipped to optimize various fields such as housing security, sustainable transportation, and human settlement management. But this conclusion contradicts existing research (Tang et al., 2017 ), which showed a weak correlation between UHS sustainability and the growth rate of economic development. The reason for this difference is the differing objects of study. The objects of the existing study are municipalities, provincial capitals and economically developed cities, which are often with large economies. The research sample of this study is much richer and the findings are more generalizable. As the scale of the urban economy expands continuously, the role of economic growth in promoting higher levels of UHS sustainability gradually diminishes. This law can explain the conclusions obtained from the existing small sample study. For cities with small economies, urban economic development can help to build sustainable human settlement. However, cities with larger economies must focus on their weaknesses to further transform their economic advantages into UHS sustainability advantages. In addition, UHS development shows high value clustering, and cities can benefit from inter-city interactions to better realize SDG11 (Zhou et al., 2023 ). It is necessary to focus on resolving inter-regional economic imbalances, and realize effective coordination and cooperation between regional policies and fiscal and monetary policies by optimizing inter-regional mutual assistance, matching support and coordination mechanisms, to establish a sound regional coordinated development mechanism as soon as possible.  4.3 Relationship between population scale and UHS sustainability There is a positive U-shaped relationship between population size and UHS development, with Small and Medium-sized Cities and Mega-cities performing better. This is due to the relatively limited urban space. An increase in population can lead to a relative shortage of private housing and open public space, which can also contribute to the creation of traffic congestion effects (Bambó Naya et al., 2023 ; Chang et al., 2017 ). This suggests that Small and Medium-sized Cities may become preferable for sustainable living. Deterioration due to population growth can be mitigated by improvements in human settlements planning and management capacity (Li et al., 2022a ). But this improvement is more difficult to realize in a short time. For cities with medium population size (Large Cities and Metropolis), population growth causes road congestion, inconvenient public transport, and crowded public spaces, with city planning lagging behind population growth. To promote sustainable UHS, tailored suggestions are provided for cities of different sizes: Small and Medium-sized Cities should improve the financial security capacity of the local governments through policy support, find a development direction suitable for their cities by learning from the development path of various types of urban practices in China, and improve the management capabilities, such as rational planning and land development. For example, Small and Medium-sized Cities such as Lasa and Linzhi can introduce talents by referring to the preferential policies issued by others, enhance the potential vitality of cities without disorderly expansion, improve the capacity of urban construction, and further alleviate the UHS problem caused by overcrowding in large-scale cities. For Large Cities and Metropolis with medium size populations, the governments must enhance their abilities to build urban infrastructure construction, such as the urban renewal action currently being carried out across the country, to better promote urban development through population growth. For Mega-cities, although overpopulation causes many development problems (Li et al., 2019 ), administrative measures limiting the population of large cities are contrary to economic laws (Wang and Yu Benjamin, 2019 ). Therefore, if such cities would like to overcome the bottleneck, the government needs to carry out the overall design from the territorial spatial planning, and solve the problem of insufficient space supply within the carrying capacity of resources and environment.   5 Conclusions This study examines sustainable urban development through the lens of SDG11, developing an innovative method to evaluate UHS sustainability with seven fields and 26 indicators. It forms a pathway for the transmission of the SDGs from the global to the local contexts and provides a comparative system for assessment of global urban sustainability. It is of theoretical and practical significance to use this system to comprehensively evaluate the 143 selected cities with typical characteristics in China, and to propose corresponding countermeasures. As urbanization trends in developing countries are similar, the findings and solutions are broadly applicable. Furthermore, the integration of economic modeling to explore tolerance intervals for indicator thresholds provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the dynamic interactions between economic growth and sustainability. It emphasizes the importance of balancing development with environmental and social factors, which in turn provides theoretical underpinnings for environmental sustainability assessments. The results of the assessment indicate that the overall development outlook of UHS in China was not optimistic. The performance of sustainable human settlement development in cities was uneven and inadequate. Despite overall progress in poverty alleviation, China still faced challenges in housing, infrastructure, and heritage preservation. The overall pattern of the UHS sustainability scores in China was high in the south and low in the north, and there was a certain regional aggregation effect. Further analysis shows that the economy scale and the level of UHS sustainability present a positive correlation. But there is a marginal decreasing trend when economic development reaches a certain scale. The relationship between population scale and UHS sustainability is U-shaped, with Small and Medium-sized Cities and Mega-cities performing better. Cities are generally under pressure because of population growth. However, when cities gradually adapt to population growth, the improvement of urban vitality brought by the population will compensate for the negative effects on UHS sustainability to a certain extent. In view of the results, the recommendations are as follows: (1) More attention should be paid to the construction of UHS and regular assessment should be carried out to promote the implementation of SDG11 in China and the world. (2) To achieve the sustainability of UHS, urban development must consider all fields, while focusing on measures to solve constraints and timely reverse the development trend of stagnant or regressive areas. (3) It is necessary to take inter-regional economic imbalance as the focus, establish a regional coordinated development mechanism, and promote comprehensive inter-regional governance from various perspectives. (4) Smaller cities need to pay more attention to the choice of development path without disorderly expansion. For cities with larger population, it is necessary to carry out fine urban design to meet the different problems brought by population growth. This study can provide some references for evaluating urban sustainability, but some shortcomings still exist. Although this study directly focuses on the human settlement, there is still a large volume of data used for assessment and analysis. Some indicators are excluded from the index system because of incomplete data and other problems. Given the limitations of city statistics caliber, time, and effort, this study assesses UHS sustainability only in 143 cities from 2015 to 2019, which may incompletely reflect the overall level and characteristics of UHS sustainability in China. Furthermore, the results show the importance of government planning and management capabilities in human settlement construction. In the future, consideration will be given to making specific evaluations on the importance governments attach to human settlement development, crisis management, and social governance ability, and to further exploring effective means to achieve better UHS development.
