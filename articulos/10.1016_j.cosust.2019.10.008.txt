                  In 2015, the United Nations passed ‘Reforming Our World: An Agenda on Sustainable Development by 2030’ which established 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) to supervise global economic, social and environmental sustainable development programs. Soon afterwards, China published ‘A Proposal for Different Countries to Realize Sustainable Development Goals by 2030’ which stipulated detailed strategies. Simultaneously, China has carried out ‘the Belt and Road Initiative’ strategic planning since 2013. The proposal of SDGs provides a new opportunity of collaboration and win-win for China and countries along the Belt and Road. This paper, targeting China and its three neighboring countries along the Belt and Road, that is, India, Vietnam and Indonesia, will initially analyze the different situations of sustainable development of the four. Then, by referring to 93 measurement indicators, it evaluates the development trends of 17 SDGs between 1990 and 2015 in four countries (including 102 targets) so as to conduct a comparative analysis towards their circumstances of sustainable development in 2018 and to unravel the advantages and disadvantages of these countries. Furthermore, through social network analysis and principal component analysis to identify, correlate and match the key SDGs in these four countries, this paper intends to explore future directions for collaboration and outline concrete roadmaps for sustainable development programs. At last, it proposes a collaborative development agenda on joint realization of SDGs for China and countries along ‘the Belt and Road’.

In 2015, the United Nations passed ‘Reforming Our World: An Agenda on Sustainable Development by 2030’ which established 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) to supervise global economic, social and environmental sustainable development programs. Soon afterwards, China published ‘A Proposal for Different Countries to Realize Sustainable Development Goals by 2030’ which stipulated detailed strategies. Simultaneously, China has carried out ‘the Belt and Road Initiative’ strategic planning since 2013. The proposal of SDGs provides a new opportunity of collaboration and win-win for China and countries along the Belt and Road. This paper, targeting China and its three neighboring countries along the Belt and Road, that is, India, Vietnam and Indonesia, will initially analyze the different situations of sustainable development of the four. Then, by referring to 93 measurement indicators, it evaluates the development trends of 17 SDGs between 1990 and 2015 in four countries (including 102 targets) so as to conduct a comparative analysis towards their circumstances of sustainable development in 2018 and to unravel the advantages and disadvantages of these countries. Furthermore, through social network analysis and principal component analysis to identify, correlate and match the key SDGs in these four countries, this paper intends to explore future directions for collaboration and outline concrete roadmaps for sustainable development programs. At last, it proposes a collaborative development agenda on joint realization of SDGs for China and countries along ‘the Belt and Road’.

All rights reserved.      Introduction In 2015, the United Nations passed ‘Reforming Our World: An Agenda on Sustainable Development by 2030’ and established 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) and 169 detailed targets, which came into effect on January 1st, 2016. These SDGs, premised on the Millennium Development Goal (MDG), continue to guide global development initiatives from 2015 to 2030 after the latter expires. It aims to call on all countries (be they poor, rich or medium-income) to motivate full forces to end poverty of all variations, eliminate inequality, guarantee economic growth, solve social needs for education and public health, ensure social protection and employment opportunities, deter climate changes and protect environment. To this end, development problems in terms of social, economic and environmental dimensions can be resolved and countries can embark on a sustainable development journey. Unbinding as SDGs are, each country is accountable for observing and supervising the fulfillment of MDG. These countries have established national frameworks, and put in resources to implement the 17 goals. In 2016, China published ‘A Proposal for Different Countries to Realize Sustainable Development Goals by 2030’, which stipulated detailed strategies for implementation [1 ], established departmental coordination mechanism, and clarified each other’s responsibilities. Hence, the proposal of SDGs and the procedure to speedy realizing SDGs will propel the coordination and collaboration between different countries in the world to fulfill sustainable development and create mutual benefits/a win-win situation. In 2013, President Xi Jinping proposed a significant strategic concept ‘the Belt and Road Initiative’6  6 The Belt and Road Initiative: China’s Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. Website: https://www.yidaiyilu.gov.cn/info/iList.jsp?tm_id=540 .   for the collaboration and development of China and other countries, aiming at stimulating the sustainable development of Chinese economy, social stability and unity, and enhancing international exchanges of sciences and humanities [2 ]. ‘The Belt and Road Initiative’ Strategic Outline covers 65 countries7  7 65 countries: http://www.chinagoabroad.com/zh/article/23525 . The Belt and Road Initiative does not clearly define geographical boundaries. It is essentially an international cooperation initiative open to all like-minded countries and regions, providing the possibility of cooperation between China and the countries along the Belt and Road.   and connects the vast areas in East Asia, South-East Asia, South Asia, Central Asia, South Europe and East Africa. These areas provide the most important resources and bases for strategic supplies in the world. The countries along ‘the Belt and Road’ have great potential for complementing with each other’s development goals, as most of them are developing countries with a great prospect for further economic and technological advancement in many fields [3 ]. ‘The Belt and Road Initiative’ provides new platforms for collaborations between China and countries along ‘the Belt and Road’ in realizing SDGs goals in concerted efforts. SDGs cover 17 development areas, encompassing three major pillars, namely, society, economy and environment. It is composed of an overall goal mechanism, including (1) ending poverty, (2) ending hunger, (3) healthy lives and well-being, (4) equitable quality education, (5) gender equality, (6) clean water and sanitation, (7) affordable and clean energy, (8) economic growth and decent work, (9) sustainable industrialization, innovation and resilient infrastructure facilities, (10) reduce inequality within and among countries, (11) sustainable cities and communities, (12) sustainable consumption and production, (13) climate action, (14) sustainable use of marine resources, (15) sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, (16) peaceful, just and powerful institutions, and (17) global partnership for sustainable development. So far, most research pertinent to SDGs has focused on the evaluation of synergies and trade-offs among SDGs and the predictions for the realization of SDGs, as well as further addition and expansion of research on the measurement indicators for SDGs. For example, Mainali, Luukkanen, Silveira, et al. , by applying historical data from 1990 to 2012, analyzed the potential collaborative impact of different goals in six countries including Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Ghana, Ethiopia and Rwanda, created trans -departmental policies, and promoted collaborative mechanisms for realizing mutual goals [4•  ]. Pradhan, Costa, Rybski, et al. , analyzed synergies and trade-offs of SDGs based on the global data set, compared positive and negative inter-relationships of each country’s SDGs, and proposed highlighted trade-offs that constituted obstacles to achieving the SDGs. All these concerns need to be negotiated and made structurally non-obstructive via deeper changes in the current strategies [5••  ]. Regarding the SDGs in Arab areas, Allen, Nejdawi, El-Baba, et al.  conducted indicator-based assessments, and proceeded with a more in-depth exploration of interlinkages and dynamics among the SDGs [6•  ]. For the association between some specific SDGs, Shibata, Wilson, Watson, et al.  interviewed the people from a landfill slum in eastern Indonesia in order to explore the relationship among poverty (SDG 1), education (SDG 4), sanitation (SDG 6) and health (SDG 3), illuminating that poverty directly or indirectly affects child health and eradicating extreme poverty remains the most critical challenge [7 ]. Similarly, Roy, Pramanick analyzed the interrelationship of water and sanitation (SDG 6) with health (SDG 3) and end to poverty (SDG 1) in India, the interrelation showing a positive impact of increasing per capita GDP on improving sanitation related indicators, reducing water and sanitation related diseases, especially in children and aged population [8 ]. Moreover, Joseph, Gunawan, Madi, et al.  investigated the relationship between achieving SDGs and combatting corruption (SDG 16) in Malaysian and Indonesian, providing support for regulatory authorities to strengthen their integrity mechanisms [9 ]. Nhemachena, Matchaya, Nhemachena, et al.  employed the arithmetic average cohesion method to calculate and compare agriculture-related SDGs Index in thirteen countries across South Africa [10••  ]. Campagnolo, Carraro, Eboli, et al.  separated SDGs into three dimensions, that is, economy, society and environment, applied a comprehensive indicator (FEEM Sustainable Index) to evaluate the sustainability of diverse countries, and envisaged the index future through CGE models under varied policy situations [11•  ]. Likewise, Fullman, Barber, Abajobir, et al.  measured the health-related SDGs in 188 countries [12 ]. Nhamo and Costanza, et al.  conducted evaluation and prediction for the welfare effects of SDGs [13 ,14 ]. Srikanth, Mastrucci, Fuhrimann, Nauta, Hidayatno, et al.  analyzed the impact of SDGs implementation on other industries, such as the relationship between SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) and the power industry [15 ,16 ], the linkage between SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) and wastewater treatment industry [17 ,18 ], and the association between industrial sustainable energy (SDG 9) and industry 4.0 technology [19 ]. In addition, some scholars contributed to enriching and stratifying SDGs, contributions like working out more detailed indicators, complementing indicators, improving measurement indicator methodology, establishing national indicator database, and collecting indicator data to carry out research and design [13 ,20–26 ]. Till now, the collaboration between China and countries along ‘the Belt and Road’ has been concentrated on increasing international production capacity. In terms of sustainable development, collaborations mostly cover new energy technologies and related industrial investment and coordination [27–30 ]. In 2017, at the ‘Clean Electric Power’ -themed China-ASEAN Forum on Electric Power Collaboration and Development these countries traded views related to international energy collaborative mechanism and programs for clean energy development foresight and regional energy inter-relationship [31 ]. Concerning research on the sustainable development between China and countries along ‘the Belt and Road’, most scholars center on energy cooperation, analyze certain opportunities for regional energy collaboration in terms of politics, economy and technology on a macro base, and explore collaboration principles, modes of conduct and prospects in the future [32•  ,33 ]. Some other scholars analyze the infrastructure facilities of relevant countries along ‘the Belt and Road’ from the perspective of investment, which provides strategies for different investment modes and suggestions of risk-evasion [34–36 ]. Overall, the majority of current research still focuses on the SDGs itself, leading to few researches of collaborations among countries on SDGs. Then, in which respects are different countries supposed to cooperate? And how can each country select fields and goals that it should attach great importance to and give priorities to? This paper will give some reference. SDGs are known to embody 17 development areas incorporating three major pillars, namely, society, economy and environment. For instance, the development of biomass energy (Goal 7) can help to alleviate rural poverty (Goal 1), promote employment and economic growth (Goal 8), and build resilient infrastructure facilities (Goal 9). As a matter of fact, it is impossible for each country to develop each goal in an equitable fashion, as each country is suggested to put limited resources on key goals to effectively address the overall system. Thus, it is of great importance to find the key goals through scientific methods, whose realization will be of further immediate significance if they could be achieved while presenting win-win outcomes through international cooperation on the platform of the Belt and Road Initiative, instead though the country’ s own power. On the premise of the strategic layout of China’s ‘the Belt and Road Initiative’, this paper further researches synergies and cooperation of SDGs between China and countries along ‘the Belt and Road’. First, three countries are chosen, namely India, Vietnam and Indonesia,8  8 Because of geopolitical factors and data availability, India, Vietnam and Indonesia are chosen. They are three typical countries on ‘the Belt and Road’. India is a typical developing country which shares borders with China. Vietnam borders on China in the south and Indonesia is an island country that faces China across the sea. These three countries have significant collaborations with China due to their geological advantages. The research findings will provide a feasible reference for other countries along ‘the Belt and Road’ in SDGs.   neighboring countries on ‘the Belt and Road’ to analyze the evolution of sustainable development situations in these four countries (Section ‘Characteristics of Sustainable Development in China and Countries along ‘the Belt and Road’’). Later, based on the calculation results of our study as well as Bertelsmann Stiftung and Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN)’s,9  9 The calculation results in Section ‘SDGs Development Status-quo and Future Analysis’ are from ‘The SDG Index and Dashboards Report 2018’  written by Jeffrey Sachs, Guido Schmidt-Traub, Christian Kroll, Guillaume Lafortune and Grayson Fuller. Report download link:https://www.sdgindex.org/reports/sdg-index-and-dashboards-2018/ .   the sustainable development tendencies over the last twenty-five years (1990–2015) and SDGs development status-quo in 2018 of different countries are measured and compared, so as to identify each countries’ advantages and disadvantages (Section ‘Comparison of the SDGs Development Trends in the Four Countries’). Through social network analysis10  10 In 2017, IGES (International Global Environment System) Research Report proposes a series of quantitative research methods for goal-related systems. Firstly, it identifies the measurement indicators of the targets. Then it collects time series data of those indicators. Further based on the correlation of the time series data, it analyzes the interconnectedness between goals and targets. Through applying social network analysis (SNA), the structure of goal-related system can be analyzed and the targets that play pivotal roles can be identified.   [37••  ] and principal components analysis, the key SDGs of each country are identified [38••  ], connected and coordinated to explore future possibilities in collaborations for sustainable development initiatives (Section ‘Relevance Analysis of SDGs between China and Countries along ‘the Belt and Road’). At last, a proposal for collaborative development regarding SDGs for China and other countries is provided (Section 6).  Characteristics of sustainable development in China and countries along ‘the Belt and Road’ The practice of China and countries along ‘the Belt and Road’ contributes to the transformation of regional economic societies and the realization of SDGs, and provides sufficient examples for regional and global sustainable development programs. In recent years, these countries have combined national characteristics, economic and social development circumstances, historic and cultural traditions with national historical evolution and regional collaborations to explore independent sustainable development programs. Since 1992 when ‘the U.N. Convention on Environment and Development in Rio’ was held, China has been an active player in sustainable development activities. At present, China still leads the sustainable development practices among developing countries. Its sustainable development program features in the following traits. Firstly, strategic programming, from the onset, has been leading its sustainable development practice, which is slated as the macro-strategy for economic and social development. In 1994, Chinese government promulgated ‘An Agenda for 21st Century China’. In 2016, China formulated the ‘Country Plan for Implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development ’. Meanwhile, China focuses on ending poverty, ending hunger, ensuring well-being, healthcare and quality education and implementing other SDGs as well as an array of specific development programs.11  11 Country Plan for Implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/web/ziliao_674904/zt_674979/dnzt_674981/qtzt/2030kcxfzyc_686343/ .   Secondly, a policy system that orients towards multi-field and multi-layer sustainable development is formulated, highlighting related legal regulations and institutions and combining policy integrity with policy coordination in policy practice. Thirdly, ‘First Act First Try’ as the major roadmap for promoting sustainable development is prioritized, applying dots to activate the whole area and formulating reproducible and promotable experiences. China experiments a series of locales nationwide. For instance, Shanghai free trade experimental area and nationwide sustainable development try-out areas are set up, and 42 low-carbon provincial and municipal test spots are experimented [1 ]. As a populous nation, India has been actively boosting its sustainable development programs and contributing considerably to ending poverty, advancing economy, cleaning energies, and addressing challenges from climate changes and so on. Its sustainable development achievements are demonstrated in the following respects. Firstly, it makes relentless efforts to promote economic/strategic transformation and industrial structural adjustment so as to support its sustainable development agenda. India stipulates ‘Three Year Activity Agenda between 2017–2018 and 2019–2020 which proposes its financial deficit be reduced to 3.5% within three years, farming transformation be regulated, development of urbanization be focused, rural and regional development be balanced, efficiency of extensive application of information network and telecommunication technologies be widely utilized, as well as group prejudice and divide inside the society be eliminated. Secondly, inclusive innovation practice12  12 Inclusive Innovation: to apply science, technology and creative strategies to solve the needs of low-income groups. It includes two layers of meanings, firstly, developing innovative activities based on the specific requirements of low-income groups, so that they can benefit and enjoy new achievements; secondly, encouraging low-income groups to participate, promote and implement innovative activities so that they can play an active role and create values, which is entitled ‘Commoner Innovation’.   should serve as a new way to explore its national sustainable development. For example, India establishes Innovation Commission at county and industrial department levels, promotes ‘Commoner Creativity’ at regional level, and encourages innovation in energy, farming, education and medical research and and so on. Meanwhile, enterprises are encouraged to develop low-cost innovative industries. For example, Tata Group introduces a revised version of Nano Mini to enter Euro-American market, offering more affordable cars for low-income communities worldwide [39 ]. As an ASEAN country, Vietnam and Indonesia, proceeding from respective development status quo as well, combine their sustainable development with progress of national economy. The sustainable development in Vietnam is featured in the following. Firstly, its economic growth is highlighted to be in line with social fairness, social progress, cultural development and environmental protection. Vietnams has been dedicated to reducing poverty, realizing diversification of resources and programs and dampening two-polar separation through income distribution policy and open/effective social security and welfare system. Secondly, the all-round development of human being is considered as the core of sustainable development. In 2010, the average GDP in Vietnams reached approximately USD 1200, surpassing that of low-income developing countries. In 2008, the human development index (HDI) in Vietnam registered 0.733, above the average world level [40 ]. The sustainable development in Indonesia is characterized as follows. Firstly, macro coordination mechanism is strengthened to promote diverse players to collaborate management in united effort. With SDGs being listed on its national mid-term development agenda, the president leading the implementation of SDGs signed the legislation that lays the legal foundation for the implementation of SDGs policies. Meanwhile, diverse entities participate in implementing SDGs in whole-hearted effort, which include government, congress representatives, scholars and officials as well as businesses, charities and communities that represent the interests of all parties. Secondly, sci-tech (science and technology) innovation plays an essential role in advancing sustainable development in such aspects as the flow of domestic resources, tech innovation of information communications technology (ICT), collaboration of diverse entities and capacity building and so on [41 ].  Data and methodology Data sources SDGs are composed of 17 goals (see Table 1  ) and 169 targets (please find details at https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/indicators-list/  or refer to Annex I in Supplementary material). Because of limited access to data, this research paper will finally keep only 102 targets and apply the time series data of 93 indicators13  13 93 measurement indicators are set according to Global indicator framework for the Sustainable Development Goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/indicators-list/ ). The data are also referred to IGES as described in Footnote 10.   to conduct measurement and evaluation (see Table 2  ). The time duration spans from 1990 to 2015 to observe and compare the development trends of the 17 primary SDGs. Furthermore, the relevance of the 93 indicators will be used to evaluate quantitatively the connection between the 102 SDGs so that a relative network system for the 102 SDGs is built to analyze the overall system and structure of SDGs in a more efficient manner, figure out the key goals of each country’s SDGs (namely, the pivotal targets) and determine the important subjects for future development and international collaborations. The 93 indicators’ data are mainly from the following database: SDG Indicators Global Database (https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/ ), CRED/OFDA International Disaster Database (http://emdat.be/country_profile/index.html ), World Bank SDGs Databank (http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=sustainable-development-goals-(sdgs)# ), FAOSTAT (http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home ), UN-Data (http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=LABORSTA&f=tableCode%3a7C ), World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/TM.TAX.MRCH.WM.AR.ZS ), Climate Action Tracker (http://climateactiontracker.org/countries.html ), Ocean Health Index (http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/regionscores/annual-scores-and-rankings ), Global Forest Watch (http://www.globalforestwatch.org/ ).  Methodology This research focuses on two methods, Principal Components Analysis and Social Network Analysis. The Principal Components Analysis will be applied in Section ‘Results and Discussion’ to analyze the development trends of each country’s SDGs. Each country’s 102 targets will be categorized into several principal components representing the different sections of sustainable development, which will be applied to compare and contrast countries’ sustainable development stages. Social Network Analysis is applied to detect the inner relationship between SDGs in different countries in Section ‘Suggestions on SDGs Collaboration between China and Countries along ‘the Belt and Road’’ to determine the key goals that exert the greatest impact on SDG mechanism. Furthermore, Principal Components Analysis and Numerical Regression Method will be reapplied to examine and complement the key goals selected, screen out final key SDGs and make references for future sustainable development collaborations among different countries. The following are detailed explanations of these two analyses. Principal components analysis PCA was first proposed by Hotelling [42 ], aiming at reducing the dimensions to convert multiple indicators into a few mutually independent comprehensive indicators while still reflecting the major information of original indicators and keeping the characteristics of research subjects more concentrated and typical, hence the compression and the interpretation of data. The rationale is to convert data linearly into a new coordinate system, and then project data sets so as to achieve the largest variance which afterwards becomes the first coordinate (the larger the variance, the more information). The lineal combination of the original indicator variables is entitled the first principal component and the variance projected from the second largest coordinate is the second principal component, and so on. In this way, not only is the reduction of dimensions guaranteed, but also the largest variance contribution ratio (characteristic value) from the new data set is kept [43 ].14  14 One thing that needs to be clear is that the dimension reduction of PCA is to integrate several comprehensive indicators (namely principal components) based on all indicators, which represents different implications, rather than to select some or part of the original indicators. In fact, each principal component contains all 93 indicators with different weights, resulting in their different implications. Website: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis chttps://towardsdatascience.com/a-step-by-step-explanation-of-principal-component-analysis-b836fb9c97e2 .   Through the analysis of the principle components, the purpose of analyzing the original indicator variables can be achieved. The calculation steps are as follows: (1) process the original indicator data in normal standards to nondimensionalize, (2) work out the related coefficient matrix of standardized data matrix, (3) determine the characteristic value of the related coefficient matrix and identify principal components, (4) extract the number of the principal components, (5) analyze the compositions of different principal components. Issues of multi-indicator dimension reduction are more prominent in sociology, economics and management and so on, such as the calculation of comprehensive state power of a nation, evaluation of projects’ economic and environmental benefits, and appraisal of comprehensive evaluation of a nation’s or a region’s sustainable development capability. To deal with separation of different layers and departmental processing for multiple indicators, Mr. Zhu Qigui puts forward two methods in his ‘Evaluation of Sustainable Development’, namely, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Principal Components Analysis (PCA) [44 ]. The former is too subjective to empower indicators while the latter is relatively the opposite. Later, more scholars apply PCA to evaluate the sustainability capacities of different countries and regions and their comprehensive development stages, which all achieve quite satisfying results [45–48 ]. The different principal components in this research paper represent the different aspects of sustainable development.  Social network analysis Social Network Analysis (SNA) was applied in researches on socio-psychology in the early 20th century [49 ]. After incorporating much stricter mathematical rationale, it started to be widely applied in 1970s [50 ]. SNA is a series of standardized analytical methods used to analyze social connection and network structure. It is essentially to explain the features of network structure and explore the overall formation and joint connection of the network through diagrams [51 ]. It is advantageous owing to its enabling a clearer spectrum into the inter-connections and modes [52 ] among all factors in the network so that key influences and pivotal nodes can be unveiled. Regarding the analysis of indicator system structural features and selection of principal indicators, many scholars apply expertise grading, layer-by-layer analysis and murky evaluations [53 ,54 ], and so on. Even if some important indicators are screened, evaluations are subjective preferences, lacking adequate explanation for the relationships between indicators. Consequently, SNA gradually exposes its merits which enable pivotal indicators to be identified and extracted layer by layer through centrality degree and other indexes. Not only can it fulfill statistical presumptions over a large number of samples, but it also rationalizes the functions among indicators and ensures the accuracy and perfection of extracted indicators [55 ]. In recent years, SNA has been applied in social network, energy resources, economy, environment, medical field and sanitation thanks to fast dissemination of internet and big data [52 ,56–59 ]. At present, some scholars have used SNA to conduct research in the structure of indicator system and selection of key indicators [60 ,61 ]. In this paper, the relationship between 102 targets of SDGs which mutually promotes and restricts each other is very intricate. SNA provides a sound theoretical framework for effectively identifying the relationship between goals and successfully screening out key SDGs. The key goal set identified by SNA can be examined, prioritized and complemented through PCA. The identification of key SDGs in different countries lays a scientific foundation for the feasibility and match-up of future collaborations in terms of sustainable development in different nations.    Results and discussion Comparison of the SDGs development trends in the four countries SDGs development trends from 1990–2015 In accordance with the principal components analysis results from the 93 indicators in 1990–2015, the 102 goals are categorized into six principal components. The detailed results of principal components analysis for the 93 indicators in China, India, Vietnam and Indonesia between 1990 and 2015 can been seen in ‘Method description in supplementary files ’. On the basis of the principal component indicators and their economic significance, the Component 1 and Component 2 of China, India, Vietnam and Indonesia are extracted. The total variances explained by Component 1 and Component 2 for each country are 84.096%, 85.097%, 81.862% and 81.763%, reaching fundamental requirements for analyzing each country’s sustainable development status. It can be identified from principal component indicators that the Component 1 represents ‘the social and environmental sustainable development which includes the:(1) Human existence and well-being (to end poverty, end hunger, fulfill food security, reduce diseases, ensure healthy living styles, provide water, environmental sanitation and modern sustainable resources, establish tolerant, safe, resilient, resistant-to-hazards cities and human settlements)  (2) Education (to ensure fair and quality education, promote sufficient productive employment)  (3) Human rights and institutions (to fulfill gender equality, empower all women and girls, establish a peaceful and tolerant society, set up efficient and responsive legal system, eliminate deaths related to violence of all forms, ensure the public the access to all kinds of information, protect fundamental freedom, realize special and differential treatment policies for the least developed countries based on national legislation and international agreements as well as minimize inequality within and beyond states)  (4) Environmental protection (to minimize average negative impact of city dwellers on the environment, ensure air quality, enhance urban waste treatment, protect and use in sustainable fashion maritime areas and resources, regulate fishing activities effectively, prohibit fishing subsidies for redundant productivity capacity and overactive fishing, nurture research capacity and transfer ocean technologies, enrich varieties of marine living things, protect and use sustainably land and inland freshwater ecosystem, manage sustainably all types of forest, cultivate global plantation of trees, reclaim degenerated land, diminish deterioration of natural reserves, multiply financial resources, protect and use sustainably the varieties of living things, and protect endangered species and prohibit their annihilation).    The Component 2 represents economic sustainable development, which are composed of the following contents.(1) Enhance inclusive and sustainable industrialization, economic growth and technological innovation (through varied management and technological upgrading, high value-added and labor-intensive industries will be built to attain a higher economic productivity. It is imperative to increase the efficiency of resource use, maximize clean and environment-friendly technologies and industrial procedures, accomplish the sustainable management and efficient application of natural resources, provide funding, technological and skill-based support for underdeveloped countries, build up sustainable infrastructure facilities to combat against disasters and shocks, set up a tech-based and innovative energy mechanism for the least developed countries to make them more familiar with information and telecommunication technology, internet in particular)  (2) Establish a sustainable global partnership (strengthen south-north, south-south, triangular regional collaborations and international cooperation in science, technology and innovative industry, establish a mechanism to share knowledge and enhance coordination, guarantee global macro-economic stability and policy coordination, promote effective partnerships within the general public, between the public and private sector and in the civil society, assist the least developed and developing countries in technology and economic development. For example, developed countries assist developing countries, increase their exports, and propel debt financing, cut debt, as well as restructure debt to help them achieve sustainability in reducing long-term debt so as to lessen their debt pressures)  (3) Share fundamental resources (increase rural infrastructure facilities of the least developed and developing countries, invest in their agricultural technology development, gene data pool of plants and livestock, strengthen agricultural productivity, endow sanitation services, and offer technologies of waste water treatment and recycling for those least developed and developing countries).    Figure 1   demonstrates the social and environmental sustainable development trends (Component 1 ) and economic sustainable development trends (Component 2 ) in China, India, Vietnam and Indonesia between 1990 and 2015.(1) It can be seen from Component 1 that over the last 25 years, each country has made impressive progress in terms of establishing human living environment and healthy living styles, raising residents’ living and educational level, enforcing fair legal and social system, and protecting environment against ocean, land, air and waste pollution.  (2) However, it can be found from Component 2 that regarding economic sustainability, the economic growth mainly relied on labor force expansion and consumption of natural resources due to lower level of education, backwardness of technologies, inadequacy of economic system and insufficiency of infrastructure facilities. Each country experienced a slump at some time (China between 1997 and 2006, India between 2001 and 2007, Vietnam between 2001 and 2005 and Indonesia between 1997 and 2005 ). Hereinafter, the previous massive and speedy industrialization and urbanization led to such issues as expanded investment requirements, risen prices, unbalanced economic structures, deteriorated eco-system. These countries converted their economic growth mode from an expansive one to an intensive one, and attached equal importance to stressing the significance of both economy and environment, in the hope of increasing laborer’s qualifications and efficiency of funds, equipment, and raw materials so as to realize industrial-innovation-driven sustainable growth. On top of that, collaborations between south-north and south-south in terms of scientific and technological innovation have boosted the sustainable development in each country gradually (ever since 2007 in China, 2008 in India, 2006 in Vietnam and Indonesia ).     SDGs development status-quo and future analysis Four countries, China, India, Vietnam and Indonesia, are compared in terms of their sustainable development status quo, based on Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and the Bertelsmann Stiftung’s calculation results15  15 The calculation results in Section ‘SDGs Development Status-quo and Future Analysis’ are from ‘The SDG Index and Dashboards Report 2018 ’written by Jeffrey Sachs, Guido Schmidt-Traub, Christian Kroll, Guillaume Lafortune and Grayson Fuller. For details, please see reference 62. Report download link: https://www.sdgindex.org/reports/sdg-index-and-dashboards-2018/ . For detailed methodology (on page 39) and results, please see ‘The SDG Index and Dashboards Report 2018 ’.   of SDGs’ singular index and overall index [62••  ]. Figure 2   showcases the ratings and implementations of 17 SDGs in these four countries in 2018 [62••  ]. Situation in 2018 From the measurement data in 2018 [62••  ], the SDGs index score of China registers 70.1 (global rank 54 of 156), 9.4% higher than region (East and South Asia) average 64.1, that of India 59.1 (global rank 112 of 156), 7.8% lower, that of Vietnam 69.7 (global rank 57 of 156), 8.7% higher, and that of Indonesia 62.8 (global rank 99 of 156), 2.0% lower. Accordingly, the overall sustainable development status quo is best in China, followed by Vietnam, Indonesia and India successively. From Figure 2 , it is known that: (1) Against the current landscape, China has reached the target and requirement in terms of ending hunger (Goal 1 ) and providing decent work and economic growth (Goal 8 ) and Vietnam in eliminating hunger (Goal 1 ). (2) There remain challenges for China to achieve quality education (Goal 4 ), clean water and sanitation facilities (Goal 6 ), for India to end hunger (Goal 1 ), for Vietnam to reach gender equality (Goal 5 ) and promote goal-oriented partnerships (Goal 17 ), and for Indonesia to eliminate hunger (Goal 1 ) and take climate action (Goal 13 ). (3) There remain some gaps to attain other goals in these four countries. Perceived from the status quo, China and Vietnam have yielded remarkable fruits in poverty alleviation16  16 In fact, from 1978 to 2017, China’s poverty headcount ratio at national poverty lines (% of population) declined from 30.7% to 3.1%. (Data source: https://data.worldbank.org.cn/country/china?view=chart ). Vietnam’s poverty headcount ratio dropped from 58% in the 1990s to 5.35% in 2018. (Data source: https://cn.qdnd.vn/cid-7267/7271/nid-559935.html ).   which experts attribute to trickle-down effect, inclusive development and multi-range poverty elimination [63 ]. Since 2011, China has entered the stage of targeted poverty alleviation (2011–2020), releasing policies such as poverty subsidy, reconstruction of dilapidated buildings, education subsidy, medical subsidies and assistance, photovoltaic poverty alleviation and credit discount,17  17 Data source: https://www.baidu.com/link?url=AFq_Xebqln5jgjrDesEpwU790UzbPeiezVM9cQbQVmfRAB4bHSmMA4PxFcOi8U7KL8XXnxb31VMUWqA57NcH3gTfu0x4oISoE71eCj8WjVFf3ib9odBn4AnwMftvhGcj&wd=&eqid=ac2b3cb70001cd0f000000035d47f9cf .   aiming at achieving the goal that the rural poverty-stricken population will no longer worry about food, clothing, compulsory education, basic medical care and housing security by 202018  18 Reference the ‘Outline of China’s Rural Poverty Alleviation and Development (2011–2020) ’.   [64 ].Vietnam has also made outstanding achievements in poverty alleviation and issued ‘National Sustainable Poverty Reduction Goal Plan for the Period 2016–2020 ’, including Plan 30A (rapid and sustainable poverty reduction), Plan 135 (eco-social development plan for specially-challenged areas), Media and Information Poverty Reduction Plan, etc. to provide medical treatment, education, environmental sanitation infrastructure facilities and information for poor households19  19 Data source: https://cn.qdnd.vn/cid-7267/7271/nid-559935.html    [65 ].  Future analysis in 2030 Prediction20  20 To estimate SDG trends, the linear annual growth rates (i.e. annual percentage improvements) needed to achieve the goal by 2030 were calculated (i.e. 2010–2030), which would be compared to the average annual growth rate over the most recent period (usually 2010–2015). Progress towards goal achievement on a particular indicator is described using a five-arrow system in the Figure on the right side.    For more details about the method of prediction, please see ‘The SDG Index and Dashboards Report 2018 ’ in Ref. [62••  ], Page 43.   for 2030 represents below [62••  ]: (1) By 2030, China will reach its goals in ending hunger, ending poverty, offering decent work and improving economic growth, and accelerating industrial innovation and infrastructure facilities (Goal 1, Goal 2, Goal 8 and Goal 9 ), India in ending poverty, offering decent work and economic growth and taking climate action (Goal 1, Goal 8 and Goal 13 ), Vietnam in ending poverty, ending hunger, guaranteeing clean water and sanitation, offering decent work, increasing economic growth, accelerating industrial innovation and infrastructure facilities, and taking climate action (Goal 1, Goal 2, Goal 6, Goal 8, Goal 9 and Goal 13 ), Indonesia in ending poverty, applying affordable and clean energy, offering decent work and economic growth, improving industrial innovation and infrastructure facilities, and taking climate action (Goal 1, Goal 7, Goal 8, Goal 9 and Goal 13 ). (2) There remain challenges for China to reach the standards of sustainable cities and communities, water resources and biological preservation and sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems (Goal 11, Goal 14 and Goal 15 ), for India to reach requirements for gender equality, affordable and clean energy, sustainable cities and communities, sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, peaceful, just and powerful institutions, and global partnership in sustainable development (Goal 5, Goal 7, Goal 11, Goal 15, Goal 16 and Goal 17 ), for Vietnam to reach goals in sustainable cities and communities, water resource and sanitation (Goal 11 and Goal 14 ), and for Indonesia to reach goals in equitable quality education, gender equality, sustainable cities and communities, water resources and biological preservation and global partnerships in sustainable development (Goal 4, Goal 5, Goal 11, Goal 14 and Goal 17 ). There remains a tortuous way to go in fulfilling 2030 goals. (3) In addition, there might be slumps for China to reach its goals in climate action (Goal 13 ), and for Indonesia to reach its goals in sustainable use of land resource and biological preservation (Goal 15 ). Hence severe challenges are ahead. Nonetheless, the above predictions also intimate the four countries proactive endeavors in ending hunger (Goal 1 ), providing decent work and economic growth (Goal 8 ), accelerating industrial innovation and infrastructure facilities (Goal 9 ) and climate action (Goal 13 ), such as ‘Made-in-China 2025 ’ and ‘National Climate Change Response Planning (2014–2020) ’ in China [66–69 ], ‘Agricultural development plan ’ and ‘Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) Plan ’ on climate change in India [70–72 ], ‘Vietnam Transportation Development Strategy in 2020 ’ and ‘the National Climate Change Strategy (NCCS) ’ in Vietnam [73 ,74 ], ‘Medium and Long-term Plan for National Economic Construction ’ and ‘Nationally Domestic Contributions (NDC) ’ on climate change in Indonesia [75–77 ].21  21 For more detailed information, please see the ‘Supplementary materials’.      Relevance analysis of SDGs between China and countries along ‘the Belt and Road’ Identification of key SDGs in the four countries This section will conduct a structural analysis to the relevance system of 102 targets through SNA and proceed to identify key goals. The degrees of nodes in the network are defined as the number of nodes connecting to this node. The higher the degree of the node, the more functions it plays in the network. The centrality of these nodes determines the distance from the nodes to the network center [78 ]. In the goal-related network system, each target is called one node and the causal relationship between nodes is defined as an edge with a direction.22  22 IGES (International Global Environment System) Research Report proposes a series of quantitative research methods for goal-related systems. Firstly, it identifies the measurement indicators of the targets. Then it collects time series data of those indicators. Further based on the correlation of the time series data, it analyzes the interconnectedness between goals and targets. Through applying social network analysis, the structure of goal-related system can be analyzed and the targets that play pivotal roles can be identified. For detailed information, please refer to Refs. [37••  ,38••  ].   Considering weighted input degree (the number of nodes from other nodes pointing at this node), weighted output degree (the number of nodes leaving from this node and reaching towards the rest of other nodes), weighted degree (the sum of the weighted input and output degrees), closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality and other indicators23  23 The explanation of Social network analysis (SNA): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_analysis#Connections . The explanation of SNA indicators: http://www.orgnet.com/sna.html    calculated by the software of Gephi,24  24 The introduction and application tutorial of Gephi software: https://www.udemy.com/gephi/ .   the importance of these nodes will be rated and targeted data subset will be selected that has the greatest impact on the overall network [37••  ,38••  ]. The results are seen in Figure 3  . Furthermore, the key goal set identified by SNA results in a lineal regression of the principal components extracted from PCA. Concerning the degree fitting R2 , the roles of this target subset for the principal components can be interpreted. Through the product of R2  and variance contribution rate of the principal components, the interpretation scale of this target subset to SDGs data sets can be evaluated. If the interpretation scale is lower than 95% (depreciation of subjective presumption), additional goals need to be chosen from the target set.25  25 Principle of selection: According to weights of indicators in all principal components, the target corresponding to the larger indicator with a bigger absolute value of weight should be chosen.   As more goals are added, a regression calculation is repeated, until the smallest target set with over 95% interpretation degree is obtained. Finally, the goals can be selected, identified, and optimized [79••  ]. The key SDGs sets in China, India, Vietnam and Indonesia can be viewed in Table 3  . From Table 3 , the key SDGs in China’s sustainable development program remains in ending hunger and malnutrition, increasing agricultural productivity (Goal 2- 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 ), eliminating epidemics, providing financing and technological support in researching medicine and vaccines for developing countries (Goal 3- 3.3, 3.b ), strengthening information and telecommunication technologies to enhance female power (Goal 5- 5.b ), providing fair and adequate environmental and personal sanitation (Goal 6- 6.2 ), increasing recyclable resources, offering reliable modern energy services (Goal 7- 7.1, 7.2 ), improving industrial sustainability, increasing efficiency in resource use, adopting clean and environment-friendly technological and industrial procedures, realizing favorable and preferential treatment (Goal 9- 9.4 ) to those underdeveloped countries, supplying official development aids and funds (Goal 10- 10.a, 10.b ), renovating slums, providing its people with residential and other fundamental services (Goal 11- 11.1 ), increasing plantation and replantation, preserving mountainous ecosystem and enriching diversities of living things (Goal 15- 15.2, 15.4 ), popularizing information and technology application, enhancing tech database, establishing innovation capacities mechanism, and improving information and statistical capacities. (Goal 17- 17.8, 17.18 ). India’s key SDGs include ending poverty (Goal 1- 1.2 ), ending hunger and malnutrition, improving farming productivity, preserving hereditary varieties of plantations, increasing investment in countryside infrastructure facilities, innovating farming technology, creating gene database for plants and livestock in developing countries and least developed countries through global collaborations (Goal 2- 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.5, 2.a ), eliminating epidemics and infectious diseases, providing funds and tech support for research on medicine and vaccines (Goal 3- 3.3, 3.b ), offering safe drinking water, improving water use efficiency, providing adequate and fair environmental sanitation and personal hygiene (Goal 6- 6.1, 6.2, 6.4 ), providing affordable and reliable modern energy services (Goal 7- 7.1 ), promoting mid-level and high-level scientific and technological development (Goal 9- 9.b ), realizing special and differential treatment to developing countries and in particular, to those least developed countries, providing governmental development aids and funds (Goal 10- 10.a, 10.b ), preserving at least 10% coastal and maritime regions (Goal 14- 14.5 ), increasing financial support and strengthening information and statistical capacities (Goal 17- 17.18, 17.19 ). For Vietnam, the key SDGs should be focused on the following, ending poverty (Goal 1- 1.2 ), ending hunger and malnutrition, improving farming productivity, increasing investments in the countryside infrastructure facilities, advancing farming technology, making gene database for plants and livestock in the developing countries and least developed countries through global collaborations (Goal 2- 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.a ), eliminating epidemics and infectious diseases, educating sanitation employees, providing funds and tech support for research on medicine and vaccines (Goal 3- 3.3, 3.b, 3.c ), offering adequate and fair environmental sanitation and personal hygiene (Goal 6- 6.2 ), offering affordable and reliable modern energy services (Goal 7- 7.1 ), ensuring steady economic growth, concentrating on developing high value-added and labor-intensive industries, realizing a higher level of economic productivity (Goal 8- 8.1, 8.2 ), providing African countries, least developed countries, inland developing countries and small island developing countries with funds and technological support for building their infrastructure facilities (Goal 9- 9.a ), realizing special and differential treatment to developing countries, in particular, to those least developed countries and giving official development aids and funds (Goal 10- 10.a, 10.b ), reducing violence-related death rate (Goal 16- 16.1 ), providing funds and technological support to developing countries, least developed countries and small island developing countries and improving information and statistical capacities through south-north, south-south and triangular party collaborations (Goal 17- 17.9, 17.18 ). Indonesia should be devoted to achieving such following key SDGs as ending hunger and malnutrition, improving agricultural productivity, increasing countryside infrastructure facilities in developing countries and least developed countries through global collaborations, adding investment in farming technology, making gene database for plants and livestock (Goal 2- 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.a ), controlling tobacco consumption, providing funds and tech support for research on medicine and vaccines (Goal 3- 3.a, 3.b ), enhancing information and telecommunication technologies to improve female power and capabilities (Goal 5- 5.b ), providing adequate and fair environmental sanitation and personal hygiene (Goal 6- 6.2 ), increasing the use of renewable energy and offering affordable and reliable modern energy services (Goal 7- 7.1, 7.2 ), minimizing the ratio of unemployment and no-education/no-training among young people (Goal 8- 8.6 ), promoting domestic mid-level and high-tech industries, providing African countries, least developed countries, inland developing countries and small island developing countries with funds and technological support for infrastructure upgrading (Goal 9- 9.a, 9.b ), realizing special and differential treatment to developing countries, in particular, to those least developed countries, granting official development aids and funds (Goal 10- 10.a, 10.b ), providing legal identity and birth registration for its nationals (Goal 16- 16.9 ), and improving information and statistical capacities (Goal 17- 17.18 ). All these key goal sets selected from SDGs reveals diverse countries’ own concentration on its development agenda. By means of focusing on and reinforcing these Key SDGs and further exerting their related impact on the overall goals, all SDGs will be better promoted and achieved, hence improving each country’s SDGs index score and global rank. Most important of all, the international framework and power discourse could also be improved.  Linkages and match-up of key SDGs in the four countries The status quo analysis of each country’s sustainable development in Section ‘SDGs Development Status-quo and Future Analysis’ visibly demonstrates the merits and demerits of China, India, Vietnam and Indonesia. The selection of each country’s key SDGs sets in Section ‘Identification of Key SDGs in the Four Countries’, identifies the future directions for SDGs deserving further attention. Hence on the basis of the four countries’ advantages/disadvantages and their development focuses, SDGs in different countries can be linked to and matched up with each other, so that international collaborations and agreements for development proposals can be structured under the paradigm of ‘the Belt and Road Initiative’. From Table 4  , it is known that China’s key goals should be centered on Goal 2, Goal 3, Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 7, Goal 9, Goal 10, Goal 11, Goal 15 and Goal 17 . In terms of Goal 2 and Goal 9 , China will fulfil SDG requirements by 2030. In terms of Goal 3 and Goal 5 , China needs moderate improvement, but is still sufficient to attain goals by 2030. For example, domestic policies can be advanced through international dialogue (by learning from Vietnam). For Goal 6, Goal 10, Goal 15 and Goal 17 , Vietnam takes the lead. For Goal 7 , Indonesia performs much better. China can draw relevant experiences from these two neighboring countries. Each country along ‘the Belt and Road’ can benefit from China’s supports in policies, financing and tech innovation, including India’s key SDGs (Goal 1, Goal 2, Goal 3, Goal 6, Goal 7, Goal 9 ), Vietnam’s key SDGs (Goal 8, Goal 9 ) and Indonesia’s SDGs (Goal 2, Goal 3, Goal 5, Goal 8, Goal 9, Goal 10 ). The key SDGs’ match-up among these four countries delineates a concrete roadmap and framework for international collaborations on sustainable development that promotes reliance and mutual benefits for all countries. At last, sound scientific rationale for policy-making is laid.    Suggestions on SDGs Collaboration between China and Countries along ‘the Belt and Road’ Given the above analysis of current situations and advantages/disadvantages of each country’s sustainable development program as well as identification, inter-relationship, and match-up of the key SDGs which still deserve further considerations, China and countries along ‘the Belt and Road’ have a very broad prospect for collaboration in terms of realizing SDGs in united efforts. It is imperative to enhance policy studies, construct a multi-dimensional bilateral and multi-lateral international collaboration network, explore SDGs indicator inspection and precaution system, and uphold collaborative development mechanism so as to jointly realize the SDGs of China and countries along ‘the Belt and Road’. Firstly, it is important to learn from each other’s policy experiences, and enhance communication and policy research. (1) The policy practice in China can provide macro-level development strategies and policy design experience for countries along ‘the Belt and Road’. China proposes five development concepts, namely, activating innovative driving force for development, making SDGs an integral part of national innovation programs, connecting SDGs agenda with national long-term development planning, stipulating a comprehensive proposal for different countries to target sustainable development, and identifying realization roadmaps and policy procedures. For instance, in order to end hunger, China supports its rural poor people through clear categorization, based on the requirement of ‘accuracy in supporting subjects in need, accuracy in initiating programs, accuracy in applying funds, accuracy in supportive measures, accuracy in delegating people to villages, and accuracy in eliminating poverty impact.’ China initiates ‘Made in China in 2025’ strategy, driving its manufacturing industries more ‘advanced, intelligent, environment-friendly, and better serviceable’ and strengthening innovation capacities and core competitiveness in such important fields as information technology, advanced equipment, new materials, bio-medicine. Meanwhile, China further improves its modern infrastructure network to make it more secure, efficient, intellectual, green, and interconnected. The country is expanding coverage of infrastructure in impoverished areas. Then, in the future cooperation among countries like Sino-India cooperation in energy and climate action, the two countries, as two major coal consumers, enjoy expansive prospects for cooperation and exchanges in the international coal market and clean coal technology; in terms of nuclear power reactor technology and its peaceful use. China and India, as the leading Asian countries in nuclear technology, are supposed to strengthen technology and industrial exchanges in the future. Concerning renewable energy utilization, China is currently ahead of India in the technology and market, so it is in the position to reinforce programs in distributive energy use and poverty alleviation through energy. Regarding international climate negotiations and cooperation and exchanges, the two are both BASIC countries. Against the international situation of full implementation of the Paris Agreement, China should clearly recognize India’s domestic situation and conditions of compliance while conducting supportive research on relevant decisions [80 ]. (2) The policy practices in India, Vietnam and Indonesia also provide new ideas and choices for China to realize SDGs. For example, India established ‘Inclusive Innovation Funds’ to support innovative fields that promote well-being, education, agriculture and textile as well as other social civil life fields, launched innovative programs to champion the innovation and creation of grassroots innovators [39 ]. Since 2007, Vietnam has started to develop its ‘Green Engineering’ program, applying wind power, solar energy and environment-friendly materials to ensure the engineering design and local climate matching up each other, protected urban and rural environment, and minimized adverse impact on the environment through energy and water saving practices. Secondly, it is necessary to construct a multi-dimensional international collaborative network between China and countries along ‘the Belt and Road’. Several paths present themselves ahead, such as : (1) to enrich and deepen creative dialogues between China and countries along ‘the Belt and Road’, discuss regional SDGs topics like ‘food security, clean drinking water and sanitation facilities, clean energy, climate change, public health and so on, fashion new ways to cooperate with each other, and promote public-private partnership (PPP); (2) to encourage enterprises, research institutions, universities and associations to build united labs, research and development hubs, incubators, research and science infrastructure facilities, and big data platforms, guide resources/funds towards SDGs fields, and address challenges of regional sustainable development in concerted effort; (3) to activate mechanism to promote tech innovation, collaborate in setting up technology transfer institutions and tech banks to accelerate the transfer, expansion and promotion of environment-friendly technologies and other sustainable development strategies in China and countries along ‘the Belt and Road’ based on bilateral and multi-lateral partnership agreements; (4) to establish sci-tech industrial zones and develop test spots for China and countries along ‘the Belt and Road’ in united efforts. Thirdly, it is imperative to explore SDGs indicator inspection and precaution system. Possible means are: (1) to enhance strategic research based on national status quo and development stage, learn from overseas inspection and evaluation methods [81 ], promote research in identification of SDGs key goals, discern inspection of measurement indicators, evaluate sustainable development trends, and effectively support policy design and policy evaluation towards sustainable development; (2) to drive communication and interaction between China and countries along ‘the Belt and Road’ through collaborative research, mutual visits and trainings of staff members, and release reports on related inspection and evaluation and other methods.
