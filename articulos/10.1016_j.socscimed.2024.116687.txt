                  Efforts to improve access to electricity and access to water and sanitation often go hand in hand, as they are essential components of sustainable development. By ensuring access to electricity, communities can have improved access to safe and reliable water supply and sanitation services, leading to better health outcomes, enhanced livelihoods, and overall development. This study investigates the effects of access to electricity on access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation services in 19 African countries from 2000 to 2020. Driscoll-Kraay standard errors and IV-GMM estimation techniques are used to estimate the relationship. The results show that access to electricity is positively associated with the percentage of people using safely managed clean water and sanitation services. The results also show that access to safely managed clean water and sanitation facilities in urban and rural areas turns out to be increased as far as access to electricity increases. The findings indicate that access to electricity reduces urban-rural inequalities in access to clean water and sanitation facilities. The sub-regional analyses conducted reveal that these findings are robust across SSA countries. Lastly, the findings reveal that GDP per capita, globalization, FDI and urbanization are channels through which access to electricity contributes to increasing access to safely managed water and sanitation services. African governments should implement policies that highlight the transformative potential of reliable electricity supply in ensuring sustainable and equitable access to clean water and proper sanitation facilities to safeguard public health and well-being.

By ensuring access to electricity, communities can have improved access to safe and reliable water supply and sanitation services, leading to better health outcomes, enhanced livelihoods, and overall development. This study investigates the effects of access to electricity on access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation services in 19 African countries from 2000 to 2020. Driscoll-Kraay standard errors and IV-GMM estimation techniques are used to estimate the relationship. The results show that access to electricity is positively associated with the percentage of people using safely managed clean water and sanitation services. The results also show that access to safely managed clean water and sanitation facilities in urban and rural areas turns out to be increased as far as access to electricity increases. The findings indicate that access to electricity reduces urban-rural inequalities in access to clean water and sanitation facilities. The sub-regional analyses conducted reveal that these findings are robust across SSA countries. Lastly, the findings reveal that GDP per capita, globalization, FDI and urbanization are channels through which access to electricity contributes to increasing access to safely managed water and sanitation services. African governments should implement policies that highlight the transformative potential of reliable electricity supply in ensuring sustainable and equitable access to clean water and proper sanitation facilities to safeguard public health and well-being.

Electricity is also essential for the provision of quality education. It enables the operation of schools, colleges, and universities, facilitating learning through technology, lighting, and other electrical equipment. It improves the quality and availability of education, leading to better human capital development and overall well-being of the communities (Kanagawa and Nakata, 2008 ; Karekezi et al., 2012 ; Sambodo and Novandra, 2019 ). Electricity is a fundamental input for industrial and commercial activities. It powers machinery, equipment, and technology, enabling increased production and efficiency. Industries that rely on electricity, such as manufacturing, mining, and agriculture, can expand their operations and contribute to economic growth (Blimpo and Malcom, 2019 ; Acheampong et al., 2021 ; Nguea et al., 2022 ). Access to electricity stimulates job creation across various sectors (Dinkelman, 2011 ). Industries that require electricity generate employment opportunities, both directly and indirectly. Additionally, increased economic activity due to electricity availability leads to job creation in other sectors, such as services and retail. Access to electricity in rural areas can significantly impact economic development. It improves the living conditions of rural communities by providing lighting, powering agricultural machinery, and enabling access to modern communication and information technologies. Electricity availability in rural areas can promote agricultural productivity, agro-processing industries, and rural entrepreneurship, reducing poverty and stimulating economic growth (Dinkelman, 2011 ; da Silveira Bezerra et al., 2017 ). Despite the importance of access to electricity in improving economic development, research on the effect of access to electricity on access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation services remains sparse. Adequate access to clean water and proper sanitation facilities is essential for promoting public health, reducing waterborne diseases, and enhancing the overall quality of life. The World Health Organization (WHO, 2013 ) stated that expanding access to water and sanitation services is a top priority. Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) are essential for sustainable development and achieving SDG 5, which aims to “realize gender equality and empower all women and girls”. Since over 800,000 children under the age of five die from diarrhoea every year, lack of access to safe water and sanitation services directly affects health (Usaid, 2023 ). Inadequate WASH services limit the ability of adolescent girls and women, and other persons who menstruate, to safely and privately manage their periods (Das et al., 2015 ). Between 2000 and 2022, the world has experienced remarkable progress in drinking water and sanitation. During this period, the number of people gaining access to drinking water increased from 3.7 billion to 5.8 billion people (UNICEF/WHO, 2023 ). Likewise, the proportion of people with access to safely managed sanitation rose from 33% to 57%. However, 2.2 billion and 3.5 billion still lacked safely managed drinking water and sanitation, respectively. In 2020, Africa's coverage of safely managed drinking water is 39% compared to 27% of safely managed sanitation. Thus, 411 million lack basic water services, while 779 million lack basic sanitation services (including 208 million who still practice open defecation). Over this period, 3 out of 4 people in rural areas lack safely managed drinking water, while 3 out of 4 people lack managed sanitation. In urban areas, 2 out of 5 people still lack safely managed drinking water and 2 out of 3 people lack managed sanitation (UNICEF/WHO, 2022 ). Achieving the 2030 SDG targets related to WASH will require a twelve-fold increase in current rates of progress on safely managed drinking water and a twenty-fold increase in safely managed sanitation (UNICEF/WHO, 2022 ). Progress in improving access is influenced by factors such as infrastructure access, government policies, resource availability, community engagement, and partnerships with stakeholders (Ndikumana and Pickbourn, 2016 ; Bayu et al., 2019 ; Tadadjeu et al., 2020 ; Fotio and Nguea, 2022 ). Additionally, the information on water and sanitation access is subject to change as countries and organizations implement new initiatives and investments in the sector. Efforts are being made by governments, international organizations, and development partners to improve access to water and sanitation in Africa (UN/ECA/AfDB, 2003 ). This includes initiatives such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the African Water Vision 2025, which aim to ensure access to clean water and sanitation for all (UN/ECA/AfDB, 2003 ). Electricity plays a crucial role in improving the provision of water and sanitation services, especially in the context of Africa. Access to electricity enables the use of electric pumps for water extraction, making it easier to access clean water from underground sources (Buisson et al., 2021 ). Electric pumps are more efficient and reliable compared to manual or diesel-powered pumps. Thus, ensures a consistent supply of clean water for households, reducing the burden of water collection and improving overall sanitation. Electricity is crucial for water treatment processes, including disinfection, filtration, and chemical dosing (EPRI, 2002 ; IEA, 2016 ). These processes ensure that water is safe for consumption by removing contaminants and pathogens. Electricity enables households to build and maintain improved sanitation facilities such as flush toilets. These facilities are more hygienic and environmentally friendly compared to traditional pit latrines or open defecation (WHO/World Bank, 2023 ). In areas with limited access to electricity, households often rely on alternative sources of energy such as kerosene lamps or firewood for lighting and cooking. These sources can be expensive and pose health and safety risks (Lam et al., 2012 ; WHO, 2018 ). As a result, households may have limited financial resources to invest in water and sanitation services, further exacerbating the lack of access. Electricity also enables the use of electronic devices such as radios, televisions, and mobile phones, which play a vital role in disseminating information about water and sanitation practices (Armey and Hosman, 2016 ; Houngbonon et al., 2021 ). Radio and television programs can educate communities about proper hygiene, water conservation, and the importance of using improved sanitation facilities. Mobile phones can also be used to access information and resources related to water and sanitation services (WHO, 2018 ; Mukasi and Oni, 2023 ). Access to electricity enables the use of electric pumps for irrigation, which can increase agricultural productivity and water availability (Badiani-Magnusson and Jessoe, 2018 ; Buisson et al., 2021 ). With electricity, farmers can efficiently pump water from rivers, wells, or other sources to irrigate their crops. This helps ensure a steady water supply for agriculture, reducing reliance on rainfall and improving crop yields. Increased agricultural productivity can contribute to food security and income generation, ultimately improving access to clean water and sanitation for households. Access to electricity also enables households to engage in income-generating activities, such as small businesses and entrepreneurship (Owusu and Asumadu, 2016 ; IRENA, 2018 ). Increased economic opportunities can lead to higher household incomes, which in turn can improve access to clean water and sanitation services. With more financial resources, households can afford to invest in water purification systems, sanitation infrastructure, and improved hygiene practices. Household access to electricity can also affect access to clean water and sanitation through its direct impact on education. Access to electricity allows for better lighting, which creates a conducive learning environment for students. Well-lit classrooms and study areas enhance concentration and academic performance (Rao and Pachauri, 2017 ; UNICEF, 2018 ). As education levels improve, individuals are more likely to understand the importance of clean drinking water and proper sanitation practices. Lastly, access to electricity can lead to increased industrialization and urbanization, which can result in water pollution (Pachuri, 2014 ). Industries and factories that require electricity may release pollutants into water bodies, making the water unsafe for drinking and sanitation purposes. The review of empirical literature that focused on the determinants of access to water and sanitation revealed that the effects of factors such as financial development (Tadadjeu et al., 2023 ), financial inclusion (Immurana et al., 2022 ), globalization (Fotio and Nguea, 2022 ), ICT (Nchofoung et al., 2023 ), governance (Bayu et al., 2019 ; Francois et al., 2020 ) foreign aid (Gopalan and Rajan, 2016 ; Ndikumana and Pickbourn, 2016 ; Pickbourn et al., 2022 ), natural resources (Mazaheri, 2017 ; Tadadjeu et al., 2020 ) and remittances (Tsafack and Djeunankan, 2021 ) have been investigated. However, the effect of access to electricity on access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation services is striking absent. This study, therefore, fills this gap by investigating the effects of access to electricity on access to safely managed clean water and sanitation services in 19 African countries from 2000 to 2020, making it to the best of our knowledge, the first of its kind. Choosing African countries as a sample for this research is driven by various facts. First, a significant proportion of the population in Africa lacks access to clean and safe drinking water. Many people, particularly those living in rural areas, rely on unsafe water sources such as rivers, lakes, and unprotected wells. Second, access to improved sanitation facilities, such as toilets and proper waste disposal systems, remains inadequate in many parts of Africa. A large number of people practice open defecation, which poses health risks and contributes to the spread of diseases. Poor sanitation facilities also disproportionately affect women and girls, impacting their safety, dignity, and overall well-being. Third, there are significant disparities in access to water and sanitation between urban and rural areas. Urban areas generally have better access to water supply and sanitation infrastructure, although challenges such as population growth, rapid urbanization, and inadequate infrastructure maintenance still exist. Rural areas face greater difficulties due to limited infrastructure, geographical constraints, and lower investment in water and sanitation services. The lack of access to clean water and sanitation facilities contributes to the prevalence of waterborne diseases in Africa. Diseases such as diarrhoea, cholera, and typhoid are common, particularly in areas with inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene practices. These diseases have a significant impact on public health and contribute to the cycle of poverty. Fourth, although access to electricity has increased in Africa, a substantial portion of the population still lacks access to reliable and affordable electricity services, as more than 500 million people still lack access to electricity. Uncovering the effects of access to electricity on access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation facilities would be helpful to discuss the extent to which access to clean water and improved sanitation can be achieved through improved electricity availability in Africa. This study contributes to the literature in the following directions: (1) It is the first study analysing the effects of access to electricity on access to safely managed water and sanitation services, which can lead to policy implications that highlight the transformative potential of reliable electricity supply in ensuring sustainable and equitable access to clean water and proper sanitation for all communities across the continent; (2) Following UNICEF/WHO (2023)  that reported evidence of significant inequalities between urban and rural in access safely managed drinking water and sanitation services in Africa, this study investigates the effects of access to electricity on urban-rural inequalities in access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation. Addressing the disparities between urban and rural in access to clean water and sanitation services in Africa is crucial for improving public health, promoting economic development, empowering women and girls, achieving sustainable development goals, and managing rural-urban migration, (3) according to the literature, this study is the first to examine whether economic growth, globalization, FDI, and urbanization are channels through which access to electricity affects access to safely managed drinking water services, and (4) In addition to used econometric methods that address autocorrelation, heteroscedasticity, cross-sectional dependence and endogeneity, this paper adopts a multi-staged approach to determine the impact mechanism of electricity access on access to safely managed water and sanitation services. The rest parts of the study are presented below. Section 2  is the data and method description. Section 4  is the discussion of the results, and Section 5  is the conclusion and policy implications.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Data This study uses a panel of 19 African countries with annual data over the period 2000–2020 to investigate the effects of access to electricity on access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation services. The choice of the time span and number of countries were contingent upon the availability of data on access to safely managed water and sanitation services. The list of countries is presented in Appendix A1. Data for the panel are mainly taken from the World Bank (2022)  World Development Indicators (WDI), the Variety Democracies (V-Dem) dataset developed by Coppedge et al. (2018)  and the KOF globalization index dataset (Gygli et al., 2019 ). As dependent variables, this study relies on the percentage of people using safely managed water and sanitation services and urban-rural inequality in access to safely managed clean water and sanitation facilities. Drinking water sources include piped water, boreholes or tubewells, protected dug wells, protected springs, and packaged or delivered water. Improved sanitation facilities comprise flush/pour flush to piped sewer systems, septic tanks or pit latrines: ventilated improved pit latrines, compositing toilets or pit latrines with slabs. Data are obtained from the World Bank (2022) . Inequalities in access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation services refer to the disparities between urban and rural areas in terms of the availability, quality, and accessibility of clean water and sanitation facilities. It highlights the unequal distribution of water and sanitation services between urban and rural areas. This variable is calculated as the differences in access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation services between urban and rural areas (Nguea et al., 2022 ; Fotio and Nguea, 2022 , Noumba and Nguea, 2023 ). To measure access to electricity, this study uses the percentage of the total population with access to electricity collected from the World Bank (2022) . Though relying solely on household access to electricity may not capture the specific challenges and disparities in electricity access within healthcare services, household access to electricity can serve as a proxy indicator for the availability of electricity in healthcare facilities. When households have access to electricity, it suggests that there is at least some level of electricity infrastructure in the area, which can potentially support healthcare facilities. While it may not provide a comprehensive picture of electricity access in healthcare services, it can still provide valuable insights into the overall availability of electricity in a given region or country. Additionally, household access to electricity is often used as an indicator of overall development, infrastructure availability and electrification (Trotter, 2016 ). It is closely linked to various socio-economic factors, including access to healthcare services. Therefore, improvements in household access to electricity can indirectly contribute to better access to electricity in healthcare facilities. On the control variables, GDP per capita, globalization, population growth, and democracy are included in the model. GDP per capita extracted from WDI accounts for economic development. As economies grow, governments may allocate a larger portion of their budget towards public services, including water and sanitation. Increased government expenditure can support the expansion and maintenance of water and sanitation infrastructure, ensuring better access for the population. Furthermore, households are more disposed to spend on access to basic social services like electricity, water, and sanitation as GDP per capita increases (Fotio and Nguea, 2022 ; Ahlborg et al., 2015 ; Tsafack and Djeunankan, 2021 ). The overall KOF index from Gygli et al. (2019)  controls the level of globalization. Globalization can have both positive and negative impacts on access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation services. On the positive side, globalization can bring increased investment and technological advancements in water and sanitation infrastructure. Global companies and organizations may invest in developing countries to improve water and sanitation services, bringing in new technologies and expertise (Fotio and Nguea, 2022 ). This can lead to improved access to clean water and sanitation facilities for local communities. However, globalization can also pose challenges to access to water and sanitation services. For example, the privatization of water services, which is often associated with globalization, can lead to increased costs and inequalities in access. Private companies may prioritize profit over providing affordable and equitable access to water and sanitation, leading to disparities in service provision (Bakker, 2007 ). The inclusion of the annual population growth rate (population growth) accounts for the relevance of demographic change. Population growth can put a strain on access to safely managed water and sanitation services. As more people require access to sanitation facilities, there is a need for increased investment in infrastructure such as toilets, sewage systems, and wastewater treatment plants. As the population grows, the demand for basic social services (e.g., water, electricity, and sanitation among others) increases, putting pressure on existing infrastructure and resources. This can lead to challenges in providing adequate and sustainable access to water and sanitation for all (Noumba et al., 2022 ; Nguea et al., 2022 ). The quality of political institutions is measured by the Liberal democracy index from the Variety Democracies (V-Dem) database developed by Coppedge et al. (2018) . This index underlines the importance of protecting individual and minority rights against the tyranny of the state and the tyranny of the majority (Coppedge et al., 2018 ). The liberal democracy index ranges from 0 to 1. Democracy, as a political system, is characterized by citizen participation, accountability, and transparency. These principles can contribute to better governance and decision-making processes, which in turn can lead to improved access to essential services such as water and sanitation. Furthermore, democracy promotes transparency and accountability in resource allocation and public spending. This can help ensure that sufficient funds are allocated to water and sanitation infrastructure development and maintenance (Kaufman and Segura-Ubiergo, 2001 ; Kudamatsu, 2012 ; Lake and Baum, 2001 ). The findings of earlier studies revealed that democracy is important for expanding access to fundamental social services in Africa (Ahlborg et al., 2015 ; Nguea et al., 2022 ).  2.2 Empirical strategy To investigate the effects of access to electricity on access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation services, the following Eq. (1)  is specified(1) A c c e s s  i t   = α 0  + β 1  E L  i t   + β j  X i t   + μ i  + φ t  + ε i t       In Equation (1)  the subscripts i    and t    denote the country and time. Access is the share of the population (total, rural and urban, alternatively) that has access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation services, E L    stands for access to electricity, X    is a vector of control variables consisting of other determinants of dependent variables, namely GDP per capita, globalization, population growth and democracy, μ i     is unobserved country-specific effects, φ t     is time specific effect and ε i t      is the error term. To investigate whether access to electricity reduces or increases urban-rural inequalities in access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation services Eq. (2)  is specified as follows.(2) I n e q u a l i t y  i t   = α 0  + β 1  E L  i t   + β j  X i t   + μ i  + φ t  + ε i t        I n e q u a l i t y    is the difference in access to safely managed water and sanitation services between urban and rural areas. The other terms and symbols are unchanged. We contend that electrification helps to reduce inequality if β 1     <0. Otherwise, it increases it. To estimate the effects of access to electricity on access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation facilities, this study first uses the Driscoll and Kraay (1998)  standard errors method. The Driscoll-Kraay standard errors method is used to estimate standard errors in the presence of serial correlation or heteroscedasticity. The Driscoll-Kraay standard errors method provides a robust and reliable estimator in both cross-sectional and temporal dependence (Hoechle, 2007 ). The Driscoll-Kraay estimation technique can also control for missing data series and performs with balanced and unbalanced panels (Hoechle, 2007 ). While the Driscoll-Kraay estimators are useful, they are inefficient when there is concern about endogeneity. The instrumental variables generalized method of moments (IV-GMM) technique provides a way to address endogeneity issues and obtain consistent estimates of the parameters of interest. Furthermore, the IV-GMM estimate produces long-run coefficients and is consistent with Driscoll-Kraay standard errors that are robust to ‘spatial’ and temporal dependence even when the time dimension becomes relatively large (Baum et al., 2003 ; Boateng et al., 2021 ). Lastly, dummies representing countries are included in the regressions to control for fixed effects, while the first lags of the explanatory and control variables are employed as possible instruments for this estimation. It is widely used in econometric analysis, especially when dealing with complex models and situations where ordinary least squares estimation may yield biased or inconsistent results. The Hansen J-statistics is employed to evaluate the validity of the instrumental variables and the adequacy of the model. The IV-GMM estimator has been utilised in previous studies (Adams and Acheampong, 2019 ; Boateng et al., 2021 ; Opoku et al., 2022 ; Nguea, 2023a , 2023b ).   3 Results and discussions 3.1 Descriptive statistics and plots of variables Table 1   presents descriptive statistics of the variables employed in this study. Table 1  shows that the sample's average access to electricity (% total population) is 39.465%, with Morocco and Tunisia recording the highest percentage (100) in 2020. The average of people using safely managed drinking water services (% total population) for the sample is 25.436, while Morocco registered the sample's maximum value (99.945) in 2020. Looking at the sanitation variable, the average access to safely managed sanitation facilities (% total population) registered in the sample is 20.810 and the maximum (80.757) belonged to Tunisia in 2020. Besides, access to basic clean water and sanitation services varies significantly between and within African countries. According to data, only 42.674% of Africa's urban population compared to an average of 13.982% of the rural population has access to clean water. 24% of urban residents use securely managed sanitation services compared to 18% of rural residents when it comes to access to better sanitation services. Though this difference is not large, the disparity between urban and rural access to sanitation services in Africa is important for several reasons: first, women and girls are disproportionately affected by the lack of sanitation facilities in rural areas. They often have to travel long distances to access toilets, which can expose them to safety risks and limit their ability to participate in education, work, and other activities. Second, inadequate sanitation facilities in rural areas can lead to the contamination of water sources and the spread of waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea, cholera, and typhoid. This can have a significant impact on public health, leading to increased morbidity and mortality rates, particularly among children. Fig. 1   hereunder shows that the average (across years) access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation services has been consistently trending upwards from the beginning of the study period to the end. Fig. 1  also shows some fluctuating patterns in access to electricity principally from 2000 to 2007, and an upward trend from 2007 to 2020. Furthermore, the scatterplots in Figs. 2 and 3    clearly show that an increase in access to electricity is associated with increases in the percentage of people using safely managed drinking water and sanitation services. While access to electricity is positively correlated to inequalities in access to drinking water, its association with inequalities in access to improved sanitation is negative. Furthermore, Figs. 2 and 3  also show that countries situated below the linear prediction plot are countries experiencing low access to electricity and access to safely managed water and sanitation services. This is because the lack of electricity can impact personal hygiene practices, as it limits access to lighting and electrical appliances such as water heaters and washing machines. Inadequate lighting can make it difficult to maintain cleanliness and hygiene, especially in areas without access to natural light sources. The absence of electrical appliances can also make it challenging to heat water for bathing or washing clothes, further affecting hygiene practices. For instance, Chad with the lowest average electricity access (6.777) over the period has also experienced the lowest average values of access to safely managed water (9.08) and sanitation services (5.59). It is followed by the Central African Republic with 17.065 (electricity access), 10.055 (safely managed drinking water) and 7.292 (safely managed sanitation services). Thus, the lack of electricity can significantly impact access to improved water and sanitation services in a country. However, to shed more light on the link between access to electricity and access to clean water and improved sanitation facilities, it remains crucial to apply econometric analyses.  3.2 Cross-sectional dependence and panel unit root test results To ensure the validity, efficiency and robustness of the estimated results, the cross-sectional dependence test has been checked by employing the Pesaran (2021)  CD test for the individual variables. The results reported in Table 2  , show that data are cross-sectionally dependent except for rural access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation services, implying that a shock that happens in a country of the sample might have a spillover on another country of the sample. Further, the stationarity results from Pesaran's cross-sectionally augmented Dickey-Fuller (PESCADF) panel unit root test (Pesaran, 2007 ) reported in Table 3   show that urban and rural access to safely managed clean water services, inequalities in access to safely managed drinking water, urban access to safely managed sanitation facilities, globalization, democracy and population growth are stationary at levels. However, the results confirm that all variables were found stationary at the first difference.  3.3 The effects of access to electricity and access to safely managed water and sanitation services in Africa The results of Driscoll-Kraay (DK) and IV-GMM estimates of the effects of electricity access on people using safely managed drinking water and sanitation services are reported in Table 4  . The results show a positive and significant effect of total access to electricity on access to safely managed drinking water services which exhibits that holding other factors constant, 0.172% (DK) and 0.202% (IV-GMM) increases in access to safely managed clean water services will be caused by a 1% rise in electricity access. Similarly, access to electricity affects access to safely managed sanitation services positively, implying that a 1% increase in electricity will increase access to safely managed sanitation facilities by 0.264% (DK) and 0.247% (IV-GMM). This result is in line with the IEA (2016)  report which highlights that access to electricity is vital in improving access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation services. Access to electricity stimulates economic development, leading to improved water and sanitation services. With electricity, businesses can thrive; creating job opportunities and generating income for individuals and communities, this increased economic activity can contribute to the funding and maintenance of water and sanitation infrastructure, ensuring sustainable access to these services. With electricity, households can have electric lighting, enabling better visibility and hygiene practices during night-time hours. Access to electricity also supports the use of electric-powered appliances such as water heaters, washing machines, and refrigerators, which contribute to improved personal hygiene and sanitation. However, some African countries have invested significant resources for example in electricity such as Sierra Leone, Ghana, and Sao Tome and Principe but this is not matched with safely managed drinking water and sanitation systems. Access to clean water and sanitation services is not solely dependent on infrastructure development. Socio-cultural factors, such as traditional practices and beliefs, can also influence the adoption and utilization of these services. In some cases, households may not prioritize or fully embrace modern water and sanitation facilities, leading to lower access despite improved electricity access. Some African countries have vast rural areas with dispersed populations, making it difficult and costly to extend water and sanitation services to remote regions. The cost of infrastructure development and maintenance in these areas may outweigh the benefits, leading to lower access to clean water and sanitation services. Through strategic planning, investment in energy sources, capacity building, quality education and partnerships between the public and private sectors, significant progress can be made in expanding access to safely managed clean water and sanitation services in Africa. Regarding people using safely managed drinking water and sanitation services, economic growth is one of the largest contributors, as an increase in economic growth will increase the percentage of people using safely managed drinking water and sanitation services. As countries experience higher economic growth rates, they have more resources available to invest in infrastructure development. This includes building and maintaining water treatment plants, expanding water distribution networks, and constructing sanitation facilities. These results support the finding of Fotio and Nguea (2022)  who revealed that GDP per capita is positively associated with access to clean water and sanitation services. Another factor contributing significantly to access to social services increases is the level of globalization with a positive coefficient, suggesting that an increase in the level of globalization will increase the percentage of the population with access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation systems. Globalization facilitates increased investment and funding for water and sanitation projects in Africa. Globalization can also facilitate the transfer of technology and knowledge in the water and sanitation sector. This includes the adoption of innovative solutions for water treatment, sanitation systems, and water management practices. Access to advanced technologies can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of water and sanitation services in Africa. This result is supported by Fotio and Nguea (2022) . The coefficient of democracy turns out to be negatively associated with people using safely managed drinking water and sanitation services. These findings imply that African democracies that experience frequent political instability, such as coups, protests, or civil unrest, may struggle to prioritize and allocate resources effectively towards water and sanitation services. Instability can disrupt the long-term planning and implementation of infrastructure projects, leading to delays and inadequate service provision. In some African countries, corruption and mismanagement hinder access to water and sanitation services. Elected officials prioritize personal gain over public welfare, leading to embezzlement of funds, misallocation of resources, and poor service delivery. These results are largely consistent with studies by Noumba and Nguea (2023)  who find that political institutions are negatively associated with access to electricity in Africa. The results also show that the coefficients of population growth are not significant.  3.4 Urban vs rural The 2020 UNICEF/WHO report highlights that access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation services varies significantly between and within countries in Africa. A significant proportion of the population in Africa lacks access to clean and safe drinking water and sanitation facilities, particularly those living in rural areas which rely on unsafe water sources such as rivers, lakes, and unprotected wells. Factors such as limited infrastructure contribute to the lack of access to safely managed clean water and sanitation facilities. Therefore, this study also investigates whether the effect of access to electricity on access to safely managed clean water and sanitation services differs in rural and urban areas. Table 5   reports the benchmark results with urban and rural access to safely managed clean water and sanitation services. Columns (1)–(4) show the results linking electricity access and access to safely managed drinking water, while Columns (5)–(8) report the results of the link between access to electricity and access to safely managed sanitation facilities. The results from columns (1)–(4) show that the coefficients related to access to electricity are positive and statistically significant, implying that a 1% increase in access to electricity will increase access to safely managed clean water services in urban areas by 0.095% (DK) and 0.112% (IV-GMM). For rural areas, the results show that access to safely managed drinking water services will rise by 0.207% (DK) and 0.238% (IV-GMM) if access to electricity increases by 1%. Results from columns (5)–(8) suggest that access to safely managed sanitation services in urban areas will increase by 0.187% (DK) and 0.204% (IV-GMM) if electricity access rises by 1%. The results also show that a 1% increase in access to electricity will increase access to safely managed sanitation services by 0.207% (DK) and 0.153% (IV-GMM) in rural areas.  3.5 Urban-rural inequalities Table 6   reports the results of the effect of access to electricity on urban-rural inequalities in access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation services. The results show that access to electricity is negatively associated with urban-rural inequalities in access to safely managed drinking water, implying that a 1% increase in access to electricity will reduce urban-rural disparities in access to safely managed clean water facilities by 0.123% (IV-GMM). Regarding access to sanitation services, inequalities in access to safely managed sanitation facilities between urban and rural areas will reduce by 0.092 (DK) and 0.036 (IV-GMM) if access to electricity increases by 5%. The findings suggest that policies to enhance access to electricity would reduce inequalities in access to safely managed clean water and sanitation services in Africa. These results also imply that access to electricity is more beneficial in the achievement of SDG associated with increases in rural coverage of basic and safely managed drinking water and sanitation services. Regarding control variables, increasing income per capita is likely to reduce urban-rural disparities in access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation facilities. Globalization is not significantly correlated with inequalities in access to safely managed water and sanitation services between urban and rural areas. The results also show that population growth is not significantly associated with inequalities in access to safely managed drinking water services, while it significantly reduces inequalities in access to safely managed sanitation facilities. Finally, the coefficients on democracy are positive and significant and this indicates that African democracies are oriented toward enhancing access to safely managed water and sanitation services in urban areas. Thus, rural communities’ political participation does not matter in improving access to drinking water and improved sanitation facilities compared with urban areas.  3.6 Heterogeneity analysis To account for regional difference that exists between Sub-Saharan Africa and Northern Africa in access to electricity, safely managed clean water and sanitation services, we exclude Northern African countries (Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia) from the full sample and rerun the estimations. This knowledge can inform targeted policies and interventions to improve access to electricity, water, and sanitation services, ultimately contributing to sustainable development and improved quality of life for communities across Africa. This is important for at least three main reasons. First, Northern Africa generally has better-developed infrastructure, including water treatment plants, pipelines, and distribution networks. This infrastructure enables more efficient delivery of drinking water and sanitation services (IEA, 2019 ; UNICEF/WHO, 2022 ). In Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in rural areas, infrastructure is often lacking or inadequate, leading to limited access to clean water and sanitation facilities. Second, Northern Africa has a higher urbanization rate compared to Sub-Saharan Africa (OECD/UN, 2022 ). Urban areas typically have better access to drinking water and sanitation services due to the presence of centralized systems. In Sub-Saharan Africa, rural areas often rely on decentralized and community-based solutions, which may be less reliable and accessible. Third, Northern African countries generally have higher GDP per capita and greater economic stability compared with many Sub-Saharan African countries. This economic disparity can impact the availability and affordability of drinking water and sanitation services. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the lack of financial resources often hinders the development and maintenance of water and sanitation infrastructure. The results for Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are reported in Appendix B. The results show that access to electricity is positively associated with total access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation services. The other estimates are qualitatively similar to those for the whole sample. GDP per capita and globalization enter positively, while democracy is negatively associated with safely managed drinking water and sanitation services. The effect of population growth remains insignificant (See Table B1). Considering urban and rural areas, electricity access remains positive and statistically significant (See Table B2). Akin to the full sample estimates, access to electricity reduces urban-rural inequalities in access to safely managed clean water and sanitation services (See Table B3).   4 Mediation analysis To examine whether access to electricity can indeed affect access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation services through its impact on economic growth, globalization, Foreign direct investment and urbanization, a two-staged approach consistent with Alesina and Zhuravskaya (2011) , Churchill and Smyth (2017) , Munyanyi and Churchill (2022)  and Nguea (2023c)  is adopted. First, the variables (GDP per capita, Globalization, FDI and urbanization) need to be significantly impacted by electricity access to be qualified as potential mediating variables. Second, the magnitude of the coefficient on electricity access should decrease or turn insignificant with the inclusion of these potential mediating factors as additional control variables in the model relating access to electricity to safely managed water and sanitation services. Table 7   reports the results of the effect of access to electricity on mediation variables. Models 1, 2, 3 and 4 show the effect of access to electricity on GDP per capita, globalization, FDI and urbanization, respectively. The results reported in Model 1 indicated that access to electricity is positively associated with economic growth. As reported in Model 2, electricity access turns out to be positively related to globalization. Furthermore, results from Model 3 suggest that access to electricity is positively associated with FDI. The results from Model 4 reveal that urbanization level is likely to increase in countries with higher access to electricity services. Table 8   presents the results for models including the potential channel variables as additional covariates in estimates examining the link between electricity access and access to safely managed water and sanitation services. The results reported in Models (1) and (5) of Table 8  are consistent with household's access to electricity having a positive effect on access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation services. From Table 8 , the results also show that GDP per capita is positively related to access to safely managed water and sanitation services (See Models (2) and (4)). The results present in Model (3) show that globalization is positively related to the share of people using safely managed water services, while its effect on access to safely managed sanitation facilities is insignificant (Model 8). Further, FDI and urbanization are positively associated with the share of people using safely managed drinking water and sanitation facilities. Moreover, the inclusion of GDP per capita as an additional control variable reduces the size of the coefficient on electricity access. This suggests that when a country increases its access to electricity, it creates opportunities for job creation, income generation, and overall economic development. This, in turn, leads to increased household financial resources for investment in access to water and sanitation infrastructure. The inclusion of globalization as an additional covariate also reduces the coefficient of electricity access in magnitude, implying that higher access to electricity can lead to increased industrialization, job creation, and income generation. Higher income per capita generated by globalization, can result in increased access to infrastructure, including water and sanitation systems. As countries become more interconnected through globalization, they can attract investments and technologies that can help improve water and sanitation services. The inclusion of FDI and urbanization as additional covariates reduces the size of the coefficient on electricity access. On the one hand, access to reliable electricity helps attract foreign direct investment. Investors, especially in sectors such as manufacturing and infrastructure, require a stable and affordable electricity supply to operate their businesses effectively. Countries with reliable electricity infrastructure are more likely to attract FDI, which can contribute to economic growth and development. This, in turn, can lead to increased access to water and sanitation infrastructure as households invest in these services to improve their living condition. On the other, access to electricity attracts investment in urban areas, leading to the development of infrastructure, including water and sanitation systems. As urban areas grow, job opportunities increase, since urban cities are mainly characterized by industrialization. This can lead to higher household incomes, which in turn allows them to afford improved water and sanitation facilities. The results confirm that economic growth, globalization, FDI and urbanization are channels through which electricity access contributes to increasing access to safely managed clean water and sanitation services.  5 Conclusions and policy implications Access to electricity is a cornerstone of public health infrastructure, supporting disease prevention, medical care, sanitation and the overall well-being. Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) aims to ensure affordable and clean energy for all, while SDG 6 focuses on clean water and sanitation for all. These goals are interconnected, and progress in one area can support progress in the other. This study investigates whether access to electricity contributes to the achievement of SDG 6. To this end, panel data from 19 African countries between 2000 and 2020. Driscoll-Kraay standard errors and IV-GMM techniques are employed for empirical estimations. The results show that access to electricity is positively associated with access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation services. The results also show that the percentage of people using drinking water and improved sanitation facilities increases as far as electricity access increases in urban and rural areas. The finding reveals that electricity access turns out to reduce inequalities between urban-rural areas in access to safely managed clean water and improved sanitation facilities. The results are robust to subsampling analyses. Lastly, the findings indicate that economic growth, globalization, FDI and urbanization are channels through which access to electricity contributes to increasing the share of people using safely managed drinking water and sanitation services. On the whole, the findings of this study suggest that increasing electricity access is likely to contribute to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals related to clean water and sanitation services. Based on the results obtained, key policy implications to consider are suggested. Policymakers should prioritize integrated planning and investment strategies that consider the interlinkages between the electricity, water, and sanitation sectors. This includes aligning infrastructure development plans and funding mechanisms to ensure that electricity infrastructure is adequately integrated with water supply and sanitation systems. Given the significant disparities in access to water and sanitation between urban and rural areas, policymakers should prioritize rural electrification initiatives. These initiatives should aim to extend the electricity grid to rural communities and promote the use of off-grid renewable energy solutions to power water supply and sanitation infrastructure in remote areas. Strengthening institutional capacities in the energy, water, and sanitation sectors is crucial. Policymakers should focus on enhancing the technical expertise and governance frameworks of relevant institutions responsible for planning, implementing, and maintaining infrastructure in these sectors. This includes fostering partnerships between energy and water utilities to ensure efficient coordination and operation of systems. Encouraging public-private partnerships can help leverage private-sector investments, technology transfer, and expertise in expanding access to electricity, water supply, and sanitation services. Policymakers should also create an enabling environment for private-sector participation and establish frameworks for effective collaboration between the public and private sectors. Engaging local communities and raising awareness about the benefits of electricity access for water and sanitation services is essential. Governments should promote community participation in decision-making processes, foster behaviour change campaigns for improved hygiene and sanitation practices, and provide education on the importance of sustainable water and energy use. Policies aimed at reducing poverty are crucial for improving access to clean water and sanitation facilities. Poverty alleviation programs, such as social safety nets, cash transfers, and job creation initiatives can help increase household income and affordability of water and sanitation services. Globalization has interconnected economies and societies, making it necessary for countries to collaborate on water and sanitation issues. African governments should also prioritize international cooperation and partnerships to address cross-border water challenges, such as transboundary water pollution or shared water resources. This can involve sharing best practices, technical expertise, and financial resources to improve access to water and sanitation services globally. Urban planners should prioritize urban planning that takes into account the provision of water and sanitation services. This can involve integrating water and sanitation infrastructure into urban development plans, ensuring adequate space for water and sanitation facilities, and promoting compact and sustainable urban design to minimize the distance between households and service points. Efforts should be made to strengthen democratic institutions, promote transparency and accountability, and ensure meaningful citizen participation to overcome inefficient bureaucracy, corruption and mismanagement, political instability and improve access to water and sanitation services in Africa. There are some limitations to consider for this study. Data on access to electricity, water, and sanitation services are limited across countries in Africa. This makes it challenging to draw accurate conclusions. This study explores how access to electricity can contribute to improving access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation services. It would be important to have institutional data from water and sanitation utilities or government-related service providers. Moreover, this study does not consider the role of environmental sustainability in the nexus between increased electricity access to water and sanitation services. For example, if electricity access leads to increased water extraction or pollution, it may have negative consequences for water resources and sanitation. Further studies should consider these limitations for more practical policy implications.  Funding The author(s) received no financial support for this research.
