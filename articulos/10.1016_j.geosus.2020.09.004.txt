                  The implementation of strategies to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is frequently hindered by potential trade-offs between priorities for either environmental protection or human well-being. However, ecosystem services (ES)-based solutions can offer possible co-benefits for SDGs implementation that are often overlooked or underexploited. In this study, we cover this gap and investigate how experts from different countries value the SDGs and relate them with ES. A total of 66 countries participated to the survey, and answers were grouped into three macro-regions: Asia; Europe, North America, and Oceania (ENO); Latin America, Caribbean and Africa (LA). Results show that the most prioritized SDGs in the three macro-regions are usually those related to essential material needs and environmental conditions, such as SDG2 (Zero Hunger), SDG1 (No Poverty), and SDG6 (Clean Water). At a global scale, the number of prioritized synergies between SDGs and ES largely exceeded trade-offs. The highest amount of synergies was observed for SDG1 (No Poverty), mainly with SDG2, SDG3 (Good Health), SDG5 (Gender Equality), and SDG8 (Economic Growth). Other major synergies among SDGs include SDG14-15 (Life below water - Life on land), SDG5-10 (Gender Equity - Reduced Inequality), and SDG1-2 (No poverty - Zero Hunger). At a global scale, SDG15, SDG13, SDG14, and SDG6 were closely related to ES like climate regulation, freshwater, food, water purification, biodiversity, and education. SDG11 (Sustainable Cities) and SDG3 were also relevant in Asia and in LA, respectively. Overall, this study shows the potential to couple future policies that can implement SDGs' strategies while adopting ES-based solutions in different regions of the world.

The implementation of strategies to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is frequently hindered by potential trade-offs between priorities for either environmental protection or human well-being. However, ecosystem services (ES)-based solutions can offer possible co-benefits for SDGs implementation that are often overlooked or underexploited. In this study, we cover this gap and investigate how experts from different countries value the SDGs and relate them with ES. A total of 66 countries participated to the survey, and answers were grouped into three macro-regions: Asia; Europe, North America, and Oceania (ENO); Latin America, Caribbean and Africa (LA). Results show that the most prioritized SDGs in the three macro-regions are usually those related to essential material needs and environmental conditions, such as SDG2 (Zero Hunger), SDG1 (No Poverty), and SDG6 (Clean Water). At a global scale, the number of prioritized synergies between SDGs and ES largely exceeded trade-offs. The highest amount of synergies was observed for SDG1 (No Poverty), mainly with SDG2, SDG3 (Good Health), SDG5 (Gender Equality), and SDG8 (Economic Growth). Other major synergies among SDGs include SDG14-15 (Life below water - Life on land), SDG5-10 (Gender Equity - Reduced Inequality), and SDG1-2 (No poverty - Zero Hunger). At a global scale, SDG15, SDG13, SDG14, and SDG6 were closely related to ES like climate regulation, freshwater, food, water purification, biodiversity, and education. SDG11 (Sustainable Cities) and SDG3 were also relevant in Asia and in LA, respectively. Overall, this study shows the potential to couple future policies that can implement SDGs' strategies while adopting ES-based solutions in different regions of the world.   Graphical abstract Image, graphical abstract       Keywords Sustainable development goals (SDGs)  Ecosystem services  Priority  Expert's knowledge  Network analysis    1 Introduction After acknowledging the limitations of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the United Nations has initiated seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as more integrated and inclusive solutions to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity (United Nations, 2015 ). Besides, the recognition that earth has boundaries raises the importance of sustainable development as a critical aspect of human prosperity (Rockström et al., 2009 ; O'Neill et al., 2018 ). Nevertheless, there are still critical challenges regarding the potential conflicts associated with SDGs implementation (United Nations, 2019 ; Sachs et al., 2019a ). Fu (2020)  pointed out that the prominent questions in sustainability science should be solved by integrating considerations on ecosystem services, human well-being and sustainable development. Convenient for continual monitoring, there were growing efforts made on SDGs performance evaluation. For example, Schmidt-Traub et al. (2017)  identified national SDGs baselines, which can help policymakers to prioritize measures of action; and the SDSN (Sustainable Development Solutions Network) assessed the yearly progress of each country in achieving SDGs (Sachs et al., 2019b ). Despite recognizing that SDGs are essential for humanity, their implementation in the different countries is progressing at different rates (UN, 2017 ), and recent works claimed that it is very likely that SDGs will not be achieved simultaneously (Kroll, 2015 ; Rosen, 2017 ). Sachs et al. (2019a)  highlighted that eradicating poverty and reinforcing equity are on the top priorities, showing that some SDGs are more relevant than others. For example, in Africa, the most relevant SDGs are those linked to food security, energy, employment, and industrialization (D'Alessandro and Zulu, 2017 ). From a social science perspective, people's perception and choice have a strong implication on the implementation of SDGs (Folke et al., 2016 ). Although the different perceptions about the SDGs' priorities will strongly influence their implementation, few studies investigated the priorities of SDGs at the global and regional level. These can be used to understand the SDGs implementation performance and contribute to the formulation of consistent policies. SDGs are designed to deliver the integration of social, economic, and environmental outcomes (Wood and DeClerck, 2015 ; Folke et al., 2016 ), maximizing synergies and reducing trade-offs (Pradhan et al., 2017 ; Sachs et al., 2019b ; United Nations, 2019 ). However, the broad set of indicators of SDGs can raise conflicts, be inconsistent and hamper their implementation (Costanza et al., 2016 ). Recent studies have adopted different methods to analyze the interactions among SDGs. Le Blanc (2015)  investigated different links among SDGs through target relations, using network analysis techniques to identify the existence of linkages. Nilsson et al. (2016)  used seven-point scales to depict the influence between one goal on one target and vice-versa. Pradhan et al. (2017)  pointed out that synergies between SDGs have higher proportion than trade-offs. Several studies also adopted a nexus approach to explore multi-dimensional relations among SDGs to remove the limitation of a single solution on achieving each SDG (Kim, 2016 ; Liu et al., 2018 ). As a complementary method, it is also necessary to understand the perception of SDGs and identify trade-offs or synergies. Ecosystem services (ES) are the benefits people acquire from natural environments, which are the prerequisite requirements for realizing previous MDGs (MEA, 2005 ). Sustainability science indicates that there exists a pathway to achieve sustainability that requires secure supplies of different ES that contribute to the enhancement of human wellbeing (Wu, 2013 ). IPBES (2018)  conducted the thematic assessment about the effects of biodiversity, ecosystem services, as well as the contribution of relevant SDGs on land degradation and restoration. For example, soil as a major source of multiple ES (i.e. food production, freshwater, carbon sequestration, biodiversity, habitat quality) plays important roles on food security, water scarcity, climate change, biodiversity loss and health threats (Keesstra et al., 2016 ). IPBES (2019)  introduced the concepts of nature's contributions to people (NCPs), which highlighted the interlinked challenges to be faced when achieving full SDGs. A comprehensive assessment on trade-offs and synergies among interventions with both NCPs and SDGs is helpful to understand efforts of interventions countries made (McElwee et al., 2020 ). Smith et al. (2019)  illustrated that afforestation or reforestation have impacts in turn on ecosystem services, NCPs, SDGs, showing that ES have great controls on achieving SDGs (Smith et al., 2019 ). Achieving the SDGs requires that socio-economic development should happen with consideration of biophysical constraints, which means maintaining a critical nature capital stock while providing flows of goods and services (De Groot et al., 2003 ; Ekins et al., 2003 ; Wu, 2013 ; O'Neill et al., 2018 ). Ecosystem service-based solutions that comprehensively consider land management, ecological restoration and socioeconomic preference have been integrated into sustainable management (Keesstra et al., 2018 ; Johnson et al., 2019 ). Keesstra et al (2016)  linked soil science with relevant SDGs, in terms of the relations between subject research content and sustainble goal orientation. However, there is still a lack of quantitative studies focusing on human perceptions on the relations between ES and SDGs. In this context, Wood et al. (2018)  linked the targets and ES mainly in North America and Europe. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, no study was carried out about the link between different ES and SDGs at a global level. To fill the current research gap, this study has conducted a worldwide questionnaire survey that can be regarded as an effective tool to discriminate the prioritized SDGs and the critical links between SDGs and ES. The objectives of this work are: a) analyze the importance of the seventeen SDGs at the global and regional level, b) investigate the trade-offs and synergies between individual SDG priorities at global and regional scales, and c) detect SDG-ES relations by cross-matrix and social networks at global and regional scales.  2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Questionnaire and identification of objective regions This study was carried out by conducting an online survey. Emails were sent to global experts whose research covers topics of sustainability and ES. We collected experts’ information on the web of science and google scholar using the keywords “ecosystem services”, “sustainability” and “sustainable science”. There has been two rounds of survey. In the first round (from June 15, 2018 to July 23, 2018), we sent 25,146 emails, and received 298 valid questionnaires. In the second round (June 2, 2019 to July 5, 2019), we sent 8368 emails and received 68 valid questionnaires. The response rates were 1.18%, and 0.81%, respectively. The detailed questionnaire is available in the supplementary material (Text S1). We asked the respondents to: 1) rank SDGs according to their priorities; 2) link SDGs with the eighteen ES (classified into provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural categories, Table 1  ); and 3) rate the strengths of the relations between SDGs and ES (from 1 to 5 scores). In addition to this, we asked respondents for their personal information on educational attainment, nationality, disciplinary field, and the number of their years in research. The 366 valid questionnaires were gathered from 66 countries and six UN regions: Asia, Europe, North America, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), Africa, and Oceania. To evaluate the status of national sustainable development, Holden et al. (2014)  use six paired indicators to create sustainable development space (SDS) indexes, and one of these is the crossed section between lower Ecological Footprint (EF) and Human Development Index (HDI). In this study, the above combination of EF and HDI was used to qualitatively divide the objective regions. EF is defined as the area of biologically productive land and water required to produce the resources for satisfying the consumption of a given population (Bastianoni et al., 2012 ). We used available EF data from 2016 (Global Footprint Network database, http://data.footprintnetwork.org ). HDI is a synthetic indicator that measures three components: 1) life expectancy, education, and a decent standard of living (Hassanipour-Azgomi et al., 2016 ). We used available HDI data from 2016 (UNDP, http://hdr.undp.org ). We divided the area into three regions by grouping the six UN regions (Fig. 1  ). The three different regions and sample numbers were: 1) Asia (119 questionnaires), Europe, North America and Oceania (ENO; 188 questionnaires), and third was LAC and Africa (LA; 59 questionnaires).  2.2 Scoring priorities of the SDGs The first question on SDG priorities allowed respondents to rank the different SDGs and there was no limit on how many ranks respondents can choose. We used the following formula to transform SDGs prioritized ranks into a hundred's mark system. The first position was given a score of 100, and the other scores ranged from a minimum of 100/17 to a maximum of 100.(1) Score = 100 i   ×   ( i + 1 − j )      where, i  is the number of ranks and j  is from 1 to i . We used the transformed scores to analyze correlations between SDG priorities.  2.3 Statistical methods and data visualizations The data did not follow the non-normality of each SDG priorities by Kolmogorov–Smirnov test at a P <0.05 level. Therefore, we used the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test to compare the differences within SDG priorities. Then, the Bonferroni test was used to do post hoc analysis of SDG priorities among Asia, ENO, and LA. The Spearman rank correlation was used to identify the synergies and trade-offs between different SDG priorities at the global and regional levels. Significant differences and correlations were considered at a P  <0.05 level. There is no rule to determine what degrees of correlation is considered strong, moderate, and weak. In views of the topic and data of this research, we interpret 0.4 as a relative strong correlation. The heatmap was applied to identify one-to-one relations indicated by the respondents. Some SDG-ES relations were not assessed by the participants, and we regard them as zero (i.e., no relation between specific SDG and ES). We calculate the average of all the scores using the following formula:(2) SDG − ES = 1 n  ∑ 1 n  S D G − E S      where n  is the number of respondents in the divided regions. A network diagram was applied to identify the strength between SDGs and ES. These analyses allowed us to identify the contributions of ES to specific SDGs. The main data characteristics were reflected by node size and line width. In this study, we selected the top 20% of the relations. All statistical analyses and graphs were carried out using “ggplot2”, “pheatmap” and “sna” in R 3.6.1 (R core team, 2019). The heatmap visualized the SDG-ES value matrices at a global and regional level, and each grid represents a relation value. The network diagram showed the most ES-related SDGs, which calculated the sum of SDG-ES values of specific SDGs. We also summed the SDG-ES values of specific ES; the related formulas were as following:(3) ES − based  SDG  i = ∑ 1 j  S D G i  w i t h  E S j     (4) SDG − based  ES   j = ∑ 1 i  S D G i  w i t h  E S j     where i  is the number of SDGs (from one to seventeen), and j is the order of ES (form one to eighteen).   3 Results Overall, 49% of the respondents had a doctoral degree, 46% master's degree, and 5% bachelor's degree. In academic entitlements, professors were 24% of the respondents, and 20% were associate professors. Their research topics mainly included environmental science and ecology, social sciences, agricultural sciences, and economics. Half of the respondents conducted academic research for more than fifteen years. The number of questionnaires per country is shown in Fig. S1 (Supplementary Material). 3.1 The SDG prioritized scores at the global and regional level At the global level, the most important was SDG2 (Zero Hunger, 78.7) and the least was SDG17 (Partnerships, 34.3, Fig. 2  a). According to the participants, the SDGs could be divided into three groups of importance (at each 15 scores' interval): 1) high importance (ranged from 78.7 to 65.0), Zero hunger, Clean water, No poverty, Good health, Quality education, Climate action and Life on land; 2) moderate importance (ranged from 59.6 to 49.3), Life below water, Clean energy, Peace and justice, Responsible production and consumption, Sustainable cities, Reduced inequality and Gender equity; 3) lower importance (ranged from 44.8 to 34.3), Economic growth, Industry, innovation and infrastructure, and Partnerships. Moreover, we explored the significant differences among the three regions, and we found Gender equity, Clean water, Clean energy, Reduced inequity, and Sustainable city had no difference (Fig. 2b ). Overall, there existed differences between the two or three regions in eleven SDGs. Comparing Asia with LA, only Quality education was significantly different (P <0.01), which showed importance of quality education was higher in LA. Comparing Asia with ENO, SDGs like No poverty, Good health, Economic growth, and Industry innovation, were significantly higher in Asia. Responsible production, Climate action, Life below water, Life on land, and Peace justice were significantly lower in Asia at P <0.001 level. Comparing LA and ENO, SDGs including No poverty, Zero hunger, Quality education, Economic growth, and Industry innovation were significantly higher in LA at P <0.05 level while Life below water was lower than in ENO.  3.2 Trade-offs and synergies of SDG priorities at the global and regional scale The results of the synergies and trade-offs between SDGs at the global level are shown in Fig. 3  . Overall, we identified 28 synergies and 9 trade-offs among 16 SDGs at P<0.05 level. SDG1 was the one that had most synergies with other SDGs. In this study, we rarely see the value above 0.6, so we considered correlations higher than 0.4 as strong positive relations (synergies). Highest synergies occurred in SDG13 vs 15 (0.68), SDG14 vs 15 (0.65), SDG1 vs 3 (0.51), SDG1 vs 2 (0.48), SDG12 vs 16 (0.48), SDG13 vs 14 (0.47), SDG5 vs 10 (0.47), SDG1 vs 8 (0.45), SDG1 vs 5 (0.43), SDG3 vs 4 (0.42) and SDG8 vs 9 (0.40). The trade-offs were found in: SDG1 vs 12, 13 and 15; SDG3 vs 14 and 16; SDG8 vs 14 and 15; SDG9 vs 13 and 14. Overall, we found that trade-offs exist between basic human wellbeing needs and environmental conservation. The nine synergies were all identified in Asia, ENO, and LA, but with different correlation strengths (see in red grids of Table 2  ). In a decreasing order, these synergies were: SDG14 vs 15 (Life below water - Life on land), SDG5 vs 10 (Gender equality - Reduced Inequality), SDG1 vs 2 (No poverty - Zero hunger), SDG11vs12 (Sustainable cities - Responsible production), SDG13 vs 15 (Climate action - Life on land), SDG3 vs 8 (Good health - Economic growth), SDG 16 vs 17 (Peace justice - Partnerships), SDG12 vs 15 (Responsible production - Life on land), SDG12 vs 13 (Responsible production - Climate action). There were thirty-one significant relations found in two out of the three regions, including sixteen synergies and three trade-offs in both Asia and ENO; six synergies in both Asia and LA; three synergies, two trade-offs and one opposite in both ENO and LA (see in orange grids of Table 2 ). Also, the thirty-eight significant relations were found in only one region, including sixteen synergies and three trade-offs in Asia; ten synergies and eight trade-offs in ENO; one trade-off in LA (see in green grids of Table 2 ). Nearly 20% of trade-offs existed in total significant relations. In particular, counter-relations were found in SDG4-11 (education-city) in LA and ENO. From regional perspectives, 53 significant relationships were found in Asia, 52 significant relationships were found in ENO, and 22 significant relationships were found in LA. The correlations between SDG14 vs. 15 and SDG5 vs. 10 in three regions all exceeded 0.4 (Table 2 ).  3.3 SDG-ES relations on global and in different regions Fig. 4   shows similar distributions at the global level, ENO, and LA on relations between SDGs and ES, while lower correlations are registered in Asia. In general, relations were mainly observed in No poverty, Zero hunger, Good health, Clean water, Clean energy, Sustainable cities, Responsible production, Climate action, Life below water, and Life on land. We summed up each value in a column of the heatmap for the SDG-based ES relation strengths. Overall, scores were highest in ENO and least in LA. The most relevant ES at global and in ENO was climate regulation, while in Asia, and LA was freshwater. The top six ES at global and regional scales, including climate regulation, freshwater, food, water purification, biodiversity, and education at global and in ENO and LA, while in Asia air purification was before education. Education in LA was the third one, before food. In detail, at the global level the top six SDG-related ES were Climate regulation (25.8), freshwater (25.4), food (25.1), water purification (24.4), biodiversity (24.1) and education (24.1); in Asia were freshwater (24.4), climate regulation (24.3), food (23.7), water purification (23.4), biodiversity (22.7), air purification (22.6); in ENO were climate regulation (27.9), food (27.0), freshwater (26.8), education (26.5), biodiversity (26.0), water purification (25.9); in LA were freshwater (22.8), climate regulation (22.3), food (21.7), education (21.7), water purification (21.6), biodiversity (20.9). The results of the network diagram are shown in Fig. 5  . At the global level, SDG15 is linked to eighteen ES with a total relation of 49.0 (respondents’ per capita); SDG13 (Climate Action) is linked to thirteen ES with a total relation of 31.5; SDG14 (Life below Water) is linked to ten ES with a total relation of 24.7; and SDG6 (Clean Water) is linked to eight ES with total relations of 18.9. In Asia, ENO, and LA, SDG15 had the highest number of interactions with the various ES (18, 17, and 18, respectively) and the total relations (multiplying the relationship strength) attained to 52.0, 46.5, and 44.4, respectively. SDG13 was in second place (15, 12, and 10), with total relations attained to 36.4, 30.9, and 20.9, respectively. Moreover, important interactions include SDG14 (11 linked with ES, 26.7 total relations) and SDG11 (Sustainable Cities) (8 links, 17.8) in Asia; SDG14 (nine links, 24.3) and SDG6 (seven links, 18.3) in ENO; SDG3 (ten links, 21.0), SDG6 (ten links, 19.2) and SDG14 (nine links, 17.5) in LA. Regarding dominant SDGs reverse associations to ES, we partitioned the scores more than 10 as the important ES in global and three regions. At a global level, biodiversity (11.2), climate regulation (11.0), freshwater (10.8), and water purification (10.6) were related SDG15, 13, 14 and 6, respectively. In Asia, climate regulation (11.3), biodiversity (11.0), freshwater (10.4), and water purification (10.3) were related to SDG15, 13, 14, and 11, respectively. In ENO, biodiversity (11.9), climate regulation (11.7), water purification (11.1), freshwater (11.1), and nutrient cycling (10.3) were closely related to SDG15, 13, 14, 6, respectively. Finally, in LA, freshwater (11.9) and water purification (11.2), biodiversity (10.9), and climate regulation (10.8) were closely related to SDG15, 13, 3, 6, 14, respectively. Overall, SDGs are unequally connected to ES.   4 Discussion The challenges of achieving SDGs involve engaging entirely new mechanisms, stakeholders, and perspectives (Waage et al., 2015 ). Our study adopted a subjective evaluation to help improve current research gaps. Globally, the SDG priorities mirror global trends, and our result confirms the findings of Sachs et al. (2019b) , which advocate that critical transformations in promoting critical investments in health, education, wellbeing as well as sustainable food, land, water, oceans are needed. In this study, we identified the most prioritized SDGs at the global level. We further compared our outcomes with the updated SDGs report. Based on Sachs et al. (2019a) , we calculated G20 countries’ SDG performance gaps (calculated by the difference between full score 100 and current scores), and we found the sum gaps of G20 in Responsible production (89.6), Climate action (80.4), Life on land (68.9), Life below water (67.7), Reduced inequality (66.8) and Partnerships (65.1) were far behind in achieving final goals. According to our questionnaire results, the poor-performed SDG13 (Climate Action) and SDG15 (Life on land) were identified as the most prioritized and high ES-related SDGs in our study. Unlike SDG13 and SDG15 have been attracted experts’ attention, SDG 17, 9, 8, 5 were subjectively less important, especially SDG17 (Partnerships), which was also the worst performance in G20 scores. From the systematical perspective, Horan (2019)  demonstrated that partnership plays critical roles on transformation. It may reflect the lack of awareness among experts, and more specific actions should be taken to draw attentions among experts, public official and the general public. Closely related to SDG13 and SDG15 are the Paris Agreement (ratified in 2015) and the IPBES Report (released in 2019). There are several initiatives in different regions concerning SDG13 (Climate Action). In Europe, Arnold and Steentjes (2017)  carried out a study focused on European Perceptions of Climate Change (EPCC), and highlights the strong public support for renewable energy sources and strategic investment to adapt to climate change. In South Africa, Rankoana (2018)  found that climate variability as a consequence of climate change has negative impacts on indigenous livelihood. In China, Yu et al. (2013)  investigated the public perceptions of climate change, and found that the population acknowledges the importance of national fiscal and taxation policy is more likely to take individual action to combat climate change. As for SDG15 (Life on Land), IPBES (2019)  actively recognizes the contribution of nature to human wellbeing. IPBES is now fully aware of the emergency to promote integrative research of multiple threats to biodiversity (Titeux et al., 2019 ). Indeed the policy encouraging actions, the strategies should focus on coordinating trade-offs between equity and efficiency on multiple environmental objectives (Guo et al., 2020 ). All in all, governments must make more efforts to promote the implementation of these goals. In this study, we showed that the SDGs with the lowest priorities are SDG 12 (Responsible Production and Consumption), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 17 (Partnerships) in three regions (Fig. 2 b). Folke et al. (2016)  classified SDG12 and SDG10 into economic dimension which depends on biophysically safe operating space (environment dimension) and social foundation, in this sense, the less prioritized SDGs will depend on SDGs which people gives more preferences. Moreover, United Nations, 2019  stressed that decision-makers of different countries should consider the human-social-environmental systems at all levels to motivate innovative coalitions and partnerships for sustainability. The only difference existed in Asia and LA was SDG4 (Quality Education), which was higher in LA. Kaino (2012)  pointed out that in order to achieve the MDGs, about 4.5 million teachers are needed in Africa, therefore there is a long way to improve education quality in this region. Taking China as an example and compare with Africa, the progress has been made in health care, poverty reduction, and gender equity in education after 40 years of reform and opening, though it still exists an appreciable income disparity between urban and rural populations (Lu et al., 2019 ). In addition, 16 major sustainability initiatives are currently ongoing to improve sustainability of China's rural land systems (Bryan et al., 2018 ). This study found that health and education are the biggest priorities in Asia, showing that wellbeing still needs improvement, despite the advances in the last decades. This study identified the synergies and trade-offs of SDG priorities at global and in different regions. We identified more synergies than trade-offs and observed SDG1 (No poverty) priorities were strongly connected with other SDGs. In previous research, different predominant relations from different perspectives emerged. Through network analysis, Le Blanc (2015)  demonstrated that SDG12 (production) and SDG10 (regional equality) provide critical connections among other goals and make the SDGs more tightly linked. Pradhan et al. (2017)  detected 10 synergistic and trade-off SDG pairs and find more synergetic than trade-off links by official statistical data. Bain et al. (2019)  investigated public views across 12 developed and developing countries to demonstrate that there are trade-offs between environmental, social, and economic oriented SDGs. Synergies between SDGs are crucial to realize SDG targets. Also, attention should be paid to trade-offs and find measures to reduce the conflicts. The complexity of the interactions between goals proposes the challenge of the SDGs as a global policy framework (Waage et al., 2015 ). From this study, the most ES related SDGs were 13 (Climate action), 14 (Life below water), 15 (Life on land) at global and regional scales, which confirmed the idea of sustainability developed by Costanza et al. (2014) . We also identified that climate regulation, freshwater, food, water purification, and biodiversity were the most relevant ES at global and regional scales. Previous works also identified relationships between ES and SDGs. Wood et al. (2018)  highlighted that individual ES make a vital contribution to achieve 41 targets across 12 SDGs (except for SDG 4, 5, 10, 16, 17), ES including food, water, habitat and biodiversity, and carbon storage makes more than 14 links to SDG targets. They also found that SDG15, 2, 1, and 6 received the highest number of ES connections. In comparison with these studies, the relevant ES is similar, while the SDG results are partly different, and we showed the environment-related SDG received more ES relations. The differences may be attributed to the different survey objectives and the respondents’ cultural differences. Wood et al. (2018)  detected ES links to SDG targets, while in our study, we were only focused on 17 goals. In addition, respondents in our study mainly come from Asia and Europe and covered six UN regions, while respondents in Wood et al. (2018)  were mainly from North America and Europe. Previous works highlighted the importance of ES importance to SDGs' realization. Smith et al. (2015)  observed that pollination service contributes SDG 3 (Good health) since they can influence the adoption of healthier diets, rich in vegetables and fruits. Johnson et al. (2019)  found that increase food production will contribute to SDG1, SDG2, and SDG13 while reduce other ES importance to achieve SDG15. The authors highlighted that food security is a priority within SDGs in sub-Saharan Africa. The above studies have proved ES could help the improvement of social, economic, and environmental dimensions (Keesstra et al., 2018 ). Moreover, ES, as a critical natural capital, could interact with labor, knowledge, and technology capitals to optimally exploit natural resources on sustainable development (Palomo et al., 2016 ). In this way, there is an urgent need to organize and better connect all actors that work together at different scales. Incorporating the trade-offs and synergies (Fig. 3 ) into the three dimensions proposed by Folke et al. (2016)  shows that the SDG synergies mostly occurred within society and economy dimensions, while trade-offs occurred between environment and the other dimensions. This behavior may be attributed to the contrasting roles of the identical motivating factors. For example, the three dimensions of SDGs are interconnected but environmental dimension is negatively affected by entrepreneurship while the other dimensions are supported by entrepreneurship (Dhahri and Omri, 2018 ). The perceptions of dominant SDG-ES links were similar at a global scale and in ENO region, which reflects the fact that awareness of environmental protection is relatively higher in this region. Several SDG-ES link strengths were varied in different regions. For example, biodiversity-SDG14 was weaker in LA region, indicating that the perceptions depend heavily on local environmental conditions. Cultural ES can be regarded as a “relational product” of natural processes and people experience including human thoughts, perception, and judgments, which is also important to sustainable development (Vasiljevic and Gavrilovic, 2019 ). This study found that education ES contributed to all the prioritized SDGs in ENO and LA, while lacked education-SDG 6 link in Asia and at a global scale. The judge on education-SDG link is not only due to experts’ own considerations, but also reflects their cognitions towards the surrounding socio-cultural environment. As societal education level improved, more links from educational value to SDGs may represent more confidence on the potential for educational value to contribute to sustainable development. In the process of SDGs implementation, some transformational actions produced profound benefits. Examples are European low-carbon innovations that change traditional fossil energy structure to an environment friendly consumption and production pattern, and Argentina's sustainable food and farming systems that shift towards open-source legal rules for seed innovation and co-operative business models (Scoones et al., 2018 ). Heimann (2019)  proposed that, with appropriate regulations and investments, the sustainable bioeconomy scenario can become a power to support SDG achievements. In addition, with rapid global urbanization, policies should be able to differentiate between urban and rural population and their different social and cultural contexts (Jiang and O’Neill, 2017 ). In rural areas, sustainable agricultural practices are critical because they can enhance soil quality, thereby improving productivity and other ecosystem functions and services, such as carbon sequestration and water quality regulation (IPBES, 2019 ). Pretty (2018)  argued that sustainable intensification (SI) seeks to develop synergies between agricultural and landscape-wide system components and becomes a priority for SDGs. In his finding, SI helps achieve agricultural and natural capital dual outcomes, and especially the prerequisite is concerned in resign which can fundamentally deliver beneficial services for the production of crops and livestock (Pretty, 2018 ). In the urban areas, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary strategies are needed to develop smart, sustainable cities because of intricate and contentious relationships with higher-level government (Klopp and Petretta, 2017 ). Moreover, it is essential to reduce the number of targets and indicators but still capturing critical urban dimensions relevant to human development, given the extraordinarily varied and numerous divergent interests in different cities (Simon et al., 2016 ). This work has several limitations, especially in the number of participants and their unbalanced distribution, despite the high number of persons contacted. We recognize the respondent numbers are not enough to provide a solid conclusion about the importance of SDGs and their relations with ES, especially in Africa and Oceania. Time and resources constrained the survey. With the valid questionnaires, we tried to have the best picture from the data collected. Secondly, our research was mainly focused on experts and not on governmental staff, decision-makers, or public. The inclusion of these stakeholders would help to have another perspective on the SDGs importance and their relations with ES. Nevertheless, academics are those that are likely more aware of SDGs principles and can offer major insights for a global orientation.  5 Conclusions The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to reduce poverty, inequality, conflict and conserve ecosystem services (ES) that are critical to human wellbeing and livelihoods. Realizing a sustainable and prosperous future is a shared vision for the global population of various horizons in the next decades. There is a necessity to go toward delivering public insights to sustainable policy decisions. Our study provides perceptual SDG priorities and SDG-ES relations by experts’ experience, which can contribute to embracing nature-based management for synergistic SDG outcomes. Through a questionnaire survey to experts, we identified SDG2 (Zero Hunger), SDG1 (No Poverty), SDG6 (Clean Water) had most priorities on global and regional scales, and SDG1 priorities had most synergies with other SDGs. Several ES, including climate regulation, freshwater, water purification, food, biodiversity, and education, had close relations with SDG15 (Life on Land), SDG6 (Clean Water), SDG13 (Climate Action), SDG3 (Good Health), and SDG14 (Life below Water). By summarizing and comparing global and regional perception, this study understands the different and common subjective acceptation to SDGs policy implementation and validates the capability of ecosystem services to fulfill integrated goals.
