                  Buildings consume vast amounts of energy and pollute the environment in various ways. Façade is a part of building's architecture that can play a significant role in reducing energy consumption, as well as alleviating its negative environmental effects. Although using smart materials in buildings' facades can help dramatically to attain the mentioned goals, very limited studies have been conducted regarding the mentioned issues. Moreover, existing studies have investigated only a few number of smart materials simultaneously. Therefore, this research aims to conduct a wider study, identify and prioritize the most suitable building façade's smart materials according to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for Shiraz, Iran. Friedman test and Analytical Hierarchy Analysis (AHP) were used to analyse data using SPSS and Expert Choice software, respectively. Produced results illustrated that “Photovoltaic materials”, “Thermochromic materials” and “Photostrictive materials” were the best alternatives for using in building's façade. Results obtained by this research can help the building industry to move through sustainability.

Buildings consume vast amounts of energy and pollute the environment in various ways. Façade is a part of building's architecture that can play a significant role in reducing energy consumption, as well as alleviating its negative environmental effects. Although using smart materials in buildings' facades can help dramatically to attain the mentioned goals, very limited studies have been conducted regarding the mentioned issues. Moreover, existing studies have investigated only a few number of smart materials simultaneously. Therefore, this research aims to conduct a wider study, identify and prioritize the most suitable building façade's smart materials according to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for Shiraz, Iran. Friedman test and Analytical Hierarchy Analysis (AHP) were used to analyse data using SPSS and Expert Choice software, respectively. Produced results illustrated that “Photovoltaic materials”, “Thermochromic materials” and “Photostrictive materials” were the best alternatives for using in building's façade. Results obtained by this research can help the building industry to move through sustainability.   Keywords Smart materials  Building façade  Analytical hierarchy process (AHP)  Sustainability    1 Introduction Construction industry is one of the most energy consuming sections of all the countries' economy. Therefore, this industry has always been associated with consuming a huge amount of energy [1 ]. Building section is regarded as one of the most energy demanding parts of the construction industry [2 ]. Many studies have been conducted regarding measuring energy consumption in buildings. According to the existing literature, building section consumes over 40% of the total final energy, exploits 30% of the natural resources, uses about 70% of the produced electricity, and also emits over 30% of the greenhouse gases in developed countries [3–6 ]. According to another study that was conducted in china, it was concluded that over 60% of CO2  emissions are due to running processes of buildings [7 ]. Thus, it is obvious that buildings not only consume a massive amount of energy, but also destroy the environment. As this study has been conducted in Iran, some statistics of this country are presented, which proves this claim. Total primary energy consumption, natural gas consumption, electricity consumption and CO2  emissions have experienced a 4.2, 7, 1.2 and 4.4% increases from 2017 to 2018 in Iran [8 ]. Exact values of the mentioned parameters from 2008 to 2018 are demonstrated in Fig. 1  . In order to alleviate the negative impacts of buildings on the environment, effective solutions must be found. According to the literature, one strategy is to use passive and active energy consumption optimization measures in both construction and refurbishment phases of the buildings [9–23 ]. Other strategies are also able to be used such as using green building principles [24–27 ], phase change materials (PCMs) [28–31 ] and smart building materials [32 ,33 ]. Buildings' façades have an effective role in energy loss, as about 20–60% of the buildings' energy consumption is due to them [34 ]. Therefore, one of the best strategies to attain the mentioned goals is to use smart materials in the buildings' façades. Generally, selecting the best building's façade has always been one of the most challenging issues in building constructions. Various properties must be considered for selecting building façades including view, insulation, cost, weight, durability and strength [35–37 ]. Smart façade materials have been defined in many researches. For instance, according to Ritter, smart building materials diagnose any change in surrounding environment and respond to it [33 ]. Smart building materials are able to change their properties according to environmental changes including temperature, illumination and moisture [38 ]. These materials are also able to produce some of the buildings energy demand, and decrease the usage of fossil fuels in buildings [39 ]. Considering sustainability in construction can have an effective role on reducing the negative impacts of buildings. According to the literature, a lot of definitions can be found for sustainability. Most of the researchers considered low environmental impacts, optimum construction costs and low CO2  emissions as major principles of sustainability [40–43 ]. Although, to the best of authors' knowledge, the best definition of sustainability can be derived from the Brundtland report in 1987. According to the mentioned report, sustainability was defined as considering future generations while using existing resources and trying to save them [44 ]. Nowadays, sustainability concept has been placed in the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals, also known as SDGs. The mentioned goals constitute 169 targets. Fig. 2   illustrates the whole 17 SDGs. As it can be seen, some of the SDGs are related to construction industry. SDG 11 is a good example which explains sustainable cities and communities [45 ,46 ]. Although considering relevant SDGs and their targets can have a great impact on buildings' energy consumption and their environmental pollution, very few studies have considered SDGs in buildings' construction and especially in selection of building materials. Balali et al. investigated 12 passive energy consumption optimization strategies and divided them into three different categories including thermal, lighting and acoustic measures in Iran. They concluded that increasing building's thermal mass, using sunspaces, and improving building's air tightness were the most effective passive strategies to reduce building energy consumption and move through sustainability [9 ]. Konstantinou and Prieto conducted a vast study on environmental design of building envelope and investigated various passive and active energy consumption optimization measures in the Netherlands [10 ]. Šaparauskas et al. compared different façades in order to select the best alternative using MCDM (Multiple Criteria Decision Making) methods and concluded that the best façade for their case study is gas silicate masonry, covered by Rockwool and Minerit facade plates. Yun et al. studied a photovoltaic façade in the UK and concluded that it can be used as a pre-heating device in winters and also a natural ventilation system in summers [47 ]. Irshad et al. reviewed papers regarding the usage of photovoltaic and thermoelectric façades for energy saving in buildings and mentioned that a combined photovoltaic-thermoelectric façade is able to save energy by 22%. Galocha et al. investigated Thermochromic Mortar (TM) façade, and illustrated that a building in which this system is used requires 3% lower energy [48 ]. Tällberg et al. simulated thermochromic, photochromic and electrochromic smart windows and concluded that electrochromic window controlled by operative temperature was the most effective window in reducing buildings' energy consumption [49 ]. As it is clearly seen, most of the researches have investigated only a few number of building façade's smart materials at the same time, especially for the middle east and Iran. Moreover, a limited number of papers have considered targets of SGDs in selecting the best building façade's smart materials. Thus, the aim of this study is to conduct a vast study in order to identify wider range of building façade's smart materials, and also select the best alternatives for Shiraz, Iran. One of the novelties of this study is considering the concept of sustainability, as well as SDGs' targets in selecting building façade's smart materials. What makes this research significant is that using the best building façade's smart materials results in less energy consumption. Also, by using the mentioned materials, negative effects of buildings on the environment are decreased. The findings of this study are able to be used by designers, construction employers, consultants and other construction industry members not only for Shiraz, but also all the other cities which possess similar climate in the world.  2 Research methodology Research methodology of the current study can be divided into three main stages. At first, a vast study was conducted in order to find building façade's smart materials, as well as selection criteria. In order to do so, papers, books, online resources and relevant reports were used as information gathering tools. Moreover, several interviews with experts were conducted in order to add information. In the second stage, the identified selection criteria were ranked using Friedman test in SPSS software. Then, in stage 3, the identified building façade's smart materials were prioritized according to the identified selection criteria using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method through Expert Choice software. The mentioned stages are illustrated in Fig. 3  . 2.1 Questionnaire Two types of questionnaires were used in this study. The first type of questionnaire was used in order to rank the identified selection criteria of building façade's smart materials using 5-point Likert scale. In the mentioned scale, 1 stood for the least importance and 5 stood for the mot importance. The mentioned criteria were then analyzed using SPSS software. The second questionnaire helped us to prioritize building façade's smart materials using Expert Choice software. In both types of questionnaires, three sections were designed. In the first section, experts were asked questions regarding their general information such as sex, years of experience, working background and qualification. In the second section, experts were asked to score the parameters. In the last section, experts were asked to mention any points that may be considered important. Produced data of the mentioned questions were then analyzed using SPSS and Expert Choice software. In order to check the internal consistency of the questionnaires, also known as reliability of the questionnaires, Cronbach's alpha coefficient was calculated. This coefficient ranges from 0 to 1. The former value stands for the complete independency of items, while the latter value stands for the complete dependency of items [50 ]. In the mentioned range, questionnaires which gain a less value of 0.5, are considered as unacceptable questionnaires. On the other hand, questionnaires possessing values of 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6 and 0.5, are considered as excellent, good, acceptable, questionable and poor questionnaires, respectively [51 ]. This coefficient can be calculated both manually or by using SPSS software. In the manual calculation, calculations take place according to the following formula: [50 ]:(1) α = j j − 1   1 − S j 2  S 2         Where the number of items, variance of the j th criteria and variance of the total score are shown by j , S j  2  and S 2 , respectively. Most of the researches have used software to calculate this coefficient. Thus, in the current study, we used SPSS software for calculation of Cronbach's alpha values.  2.2 Friedman test Friedman test, also called method of ranks, was introduced by Milton Friedman in 1937 [52 ,53 ]. Since then, this test has been used in wide areas of science [54–64 ]. In this study, Friedman test was used in order to rank selection criteria of building façade's samrt materials through SPSS software. This test can be used manually for small researches. The formula of Friedman test is illustrated as follows [52 ]:(2) x r 2  = 12 Nk k + 1     ∑ j = 1  k  R j 2  − 3 N k + 1       In above formula, k, N and R j   stand for the number of ranked measurements (columns), number of subjects (rows) and the sum of ranked scores in each column, respectively [65 ].  2.3 Analytic hierarchy process Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is one of the Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods that was introduced by saaty in 1980 [66 ]. AHP inputs are usually data derived from questionnaires. These inputs are then converted to scores in order to evaluate existing alternatives according to selecion criteria. This useful technique has proved to be accurate and been used in many studies. For instance, Wang et al. used AHP to select the best plant for phytoremediation of petroleum-contaminated soils in shale gas and oil fields [67 ]. Solangi et al. exploited AHP in their study to evaluate the strategies for sustainable energy planning in Pakistan [68 ]. Wong et al. selected intelligent building systems by AHP [69 ]. Dalaleh et al. used this technique in selection of cranes [70 ]. Readers are referred to these researches for observing more usages of AHP [71–81 ]. In this study, AHP was used in order to prioritze building façade's smart materials using Expert Choice software. This technique is able to be used manually. Therefore, for those who may be interested, procedure of applying AHP are presented. Stage 1 : pair-wise comparison matrix is developed [A]:A = a 11   ⋯  a 1 n     ⋮  ⋱  ⋮   a n 1    ⋯  a nn          Where n is defined as the matrix's order. Stage 2 : Normalized matrix [A1 ] is formed:A 1  = a 11 ′   ⋯  a 1 n  ′    ⋮  ⋱  ⋮   a n 1  ′   ⋯  a nn ′          Where(3) a ij ′  = a ij  ∑ i = 1  n  a ij     for  i , j = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , … , n     Stage 3 : eigen value and eigen vector are computed:W = W 1    W 2    ⋮   W n          Where(4) W i  = ∑ i = 1  n  a ij ′   n      Therefore(5) W ′  = AW = W 1 ′    W 2 ′    ⋮   W n ′          Also(6) λ max  = 1 n  W 1  W 1 ′   + W 2  W 2 ′   + … + W n  W n ′         Where W, Wi  and λ max   stand for the eigen vector, eigen value of the given matrix and largest eigen value of the pairwise comparison matrix, respectively. Stage 4 : Consistency is checked as follows:(7) Consistency Index  CI  = λ max  − n  n − 1      (8) Consistency Ratio  CR  = CI Random index  RI        Where RI is function of matrix size. It is necessary to mention that the accaptable rate for CR is less than 0.01. If the mentioned value is not gained, revision must be conducted. Although AHP is regarded as one of the most effective MCDM tools in solving decision-making problems, it has some limitations. One of the shortages of AHP method is that the more number of criteria exist in the study, the more number of pair-wise comparisons are required [82 ]. Thus, in the current study, 38 selection criteria were first analyzed using Friedman test. Then, the top ten criteria were considered in the AHP analysis.  2.4 Case study This study is conducted in Shiraz, Fars, Iran. This city is located in the southwestern of Iran and is surrounded by mountains. This city possesses a moderate temperature [83 ]. A building located in shiraz was considered as a case study for this research. The mentioned building was a 4-story steel structure with the infrastructure area of 1100 square meters. As a large amount of building construction takes place in Shiraz, reducing energy consumption is considered as one of the most crucial issues in this metropolis.  2.5 Sample size Sample size of this research consists of 180 experts who had contributed in sustainable façade design of Shiraz buildings. In order to calculate the number of experts required to complete the questionnaire, Cochran's sample size formula was used. The mentioned formula is illustrated below [84 ]:(9) n = N t 2  pq  N d 2  + t 2  pq       Where n  is sample size, N  is population, t  is confidence level value, p  is probability of success, q  is probability of failure and d is the acceptable margin of error.   3 Results and discussion 3.1 Analysing the sample size As it was mentioned in section 2.4, 180 experts who had contributed in sustainable façade design of Shiraz buildings were considered as the sample size. Required formula for calculating the required number of experts were also illustrated in the mentioned section. In order to gain the required number of respondents, N , t , p , q  and d were considered 180, 1.96, 0.5, 0.5 and 0.05, respectively. Therefore, the number of required experts is computed as follows:n = 180 ∗ 1.96 2  ∗ 0.5 ∗ 0.5  180 ∗ 0.05 2  + 1.96 2  ∗ 0.5 ∗ 0.5   = 122.56     Thus, at least 123 experts were needed to complete the questionnaires. Prepared questionnaires were sent to respondents. Finally, 144 verified questionnaires were attained. In other words, 80% of the distributed questionnaires were verified, which is considered as an acceptable rate. Information regarding the return rates of questionnaires are illustrated in Table 1  . Also, information regarding the experts are illustrated in Table 2  .  3.2 Reliability of the questionnaires Cronbach's alpha value were computed in order to check the reliability of questionnaires. Obtained values of the two types of questionnaires are illustrated in Table 3  . As both of the values are greater than 0.7, questionnaires are proved to be reliable [85 ].  3.3 Identification and weighing selection criteria for building façade's smart materials A vast study was conducted in the existing literature including books, articles, reports, online resources. Also, several interviews were conducted with experts in order to identify the selection criteria for building façade's smart materials according to SDGs. Finally, 38 criteria were found. These criteria were then categorized into five main groups including technical and executive factors, economic factors, social factors, environmental factors and energy consumption factors. In order to weigh and rank the identified selection criteria of building façade's smart materials, Friedman test was conducted using SPSS software. The identified criteria and results of the mentioned test are illustrated in Tables 4 and 5   . Prioritization of the selection criteria is also shown in Fig. 4  .  3.4 Identification and prioritization of building façade's smart materials In order to gain the weights of building façade's smart materials selection criteria, AHP method was used through Expert Choice software. To do so, top 10 selection criteria (according to Friedman test) were considered and pair-wise comparison was done. In the mentioned analysis, the most and least important criteria (according to Friedman test) were named M1 and M10, respectively. Result are illustrated in Fig. 5  . In order to identify building façade's smart materials, a wide study was conducted through the existing literature and conducting several interviews with experts. Most of the investigated researches considered only one type of smart materials. In contrast, in this study, six building façade's smart materials were identified. The mentioned materials and their descriptions are illustrated in Table 6   [33 ]. In the next step, AHP was used again in order to prioritize building façade's smart materials according to SDGs. Firstly, analytic hierarchy tree was formed. The mentioned tree is illustrated in Fig. 6  . Then, for each of the selection criteria, pair-wise comparison was conducted and the outcomes are demonstrated in Figs. 7-26                     . Final Prioritization of building façade's smart materials is also shown in Fig. 27  . It is noteworthy to mention that in all the stages of AHP, consistency indices were gained less than 0.1, which proves the results. As it is clearly seen, according to the SDGs and selection criteria, Photovoltaic materials, Thermochromic materials and Photostrictive materials were the best building façade's smart materials for using in Shiraz, as well as all the cities that possess the similar situation. Obtained results of the prioritization problem illustrate a logical relationship with the existing literature. However, as it was mentioned before, very few studies have been conducted regarding identification and prioritization of building façade's smart materials. Most of the studies considered a limited number of building façade's smart materials. The top 3 building façade's smart materials of this study were investigated separately in other researches and introduced as useful materials. For instance, Peng et al. conducted a research on energy saving potential of a semi-transparent photovoltaic double-skin façade in Mediterranean climate. They concluded that photovoltaic materials are very effective in reducing energy consumption and are able to reduce net electricity use by about 50% in comparison to other commonly used glazing systems [86 ]. Arutjunjan et al. investigated a Thermochromic laminated glazing façade in Russia. They illustrated that the mentioned façade can decrease building's energy consumption by 15–30% during winters and also 30–40% during summers [87 ]. Two other studies were found in which Photostrictive materials were introduced as beneficial materials in the construction industry [33 ,88 ].  3.5 Validation In order to validate the produced results, sensitivity analysis was conducted. This test is considered as one of the most reliable validation tools in decision-making problems [89 ]. Thus, in the current study, sensitivity analysis was conducted. The results clearly illustrate how alternatives are prioritized according to the existing selection criteria. Fig. 28   shows outcome of the mentioned analysis.   4 Conclusion Buildings are considered as one of the most energy consuming sections in all countries. In buildings, façades can play a significant role in reducing energy consumption and alleviating buildings' negative impacts on the environment. Therefore, in this study, building façade's smart materials and also selection criteria for choosing the best alternative for Shiraz, Iran, were identified, weighed and prioritized. It is noteworthy to mention that relevant SDGs to building construction were considered in all parts of the study. As a result, building stakeholders and engineers can use the best alternatives, and move through sustainability. Previous studies investigated a limited number of building façade's smart materials, while in this study, a wider investigation took place. At first, building façade's smart materials and also their selection criteria were identified using the existing literature such as books, papers, reports and online resources. Then, selection criteria of building façade's smart materials were analyzed and weighed using Friedman test in SPSS software. According to the test, top 10 criteria were identified. Then, these items were analyzed again using AHP method. Results demonstrated that decreasing energy consumption (M5), resistant to earthquake (M4) and safety increase (M7) with weights of 0.183, 0.175 and 0.151, respectively, were the most important selection criteria. In the next stage, building façade's smart materials were weighed and prioritized by AHP method in Expert Choice software. According to the produced results, photovoltaic materials (S) with score of 0.263, thermochromic materials with score of 0.222 and photostrictive materials with score of 0.196, respectively, were the top three alternatives to be used in buildings. Finally, sensitivity analysis was conducted to prove the results. The method used in this study is able to operate in other issues of construction industry as well. The produced results of this study are beneficial to all construction members who are related to building façades including designers, employers and consultants.
