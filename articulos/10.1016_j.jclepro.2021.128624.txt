                  The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has introduced a new sustainability paradigm that challenges private firms. According to this, in pursuing sustainable development, companies must face a complex system of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that are divided into 17 primary goals, 169 targets, and 244 indicators. This paper outlines an assessment framework to investigate how companies are dealing with this Agenda and reporting their commitment in achieving SDGs, as well as monitoring their progress. Content analysis has been applied to reduce the number of SDG indicators including only the companies' internally actionable ones and to associate them to Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) indicators. A positioning matrix allows companies to compare their strategies with those of other companies regarding their efforts in achieving SDGs. The relative position of firms in the matrix provides valuable feedback for managers giving insight into how other companies adapt their sustainability practices to the requirements of the SDGs. As a means of exemplification, the framework has been applied to a group of GRI-reporting major electricity companies. The proposed framework presents opportunities for both practice and research allowing to investigate the companies’ level of engagement in reporting and monitoring their contributions to SDGs.

Handling editor. Cecilia Maria Villas Bôas de Almeida The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has introduced a new sustainability paradigm that challenges private firms. According to this, in pursuing sustainable development, companies must face a complex system of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that are divided into 17 primary goals, 169 targets, and 244 indicators. This paper outlines an assessment framework to investigate how companies are dealing with this Agenda and reporting their commitment in achieving SDGs, as well as monitoring their progress. Content analysis has been applied to reduce the number of SDG indicators including only the companies' internally actionable ones and to associate them to Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) indicators. A positioning matrix allows companies to compare their strategies with those of other companies regarding their efforts in achieving SDGs. The relative position of firms in the matrix provides valuable feedback for managers giving insight into how other companies adapt their sustainability practices to the requirements of the SDGs. As a means of exemplification, the framework has been applied to a group of GRI-reporting major electricity companies. The proposed framework presents opportunities for both practice and research allowing to investigate the companies’ level of engagement in reporting and monitoring their contributions to SDGs.

Indeed, it explicitly calls for action not only by governments, but by the private sector and society as well (United Nations, 2015 ). As opportunities arise for businesses in their quest for sustainability through SDGs, the necessity to monitor how this sector is moving toward the 17 SDGs is relevant because of the private sector's essential role. The 2030 Agenda (A/RES/70/1) provides 17 SDGs and 169 targets aiming to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable development agenda. Furthermore, in July 2017, the A/RES/71/313 resolution published the indicator framework for the goals adding 244 indicators. This resolution intends to ensure consistency and conformity of data, as well as guaranteeing transparent mechanisms of measurement for comparability purposes for the SDGs (United Nations, 2017 ). According to Dang et al. (2019)  and LeBlanc (2015) , the 2030 Agenda indicates the evolution of how sustainability may be treated globally during the period 2015–2030. Indeed, the Agenda evidences the necessity to consider the people, the planet, prosperity, peace, and partnership as a basis to reach global sustainable development (United Nations, 2015 ). In the private sector, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) allow companies to select and to prioritize corporate sustainability issues and also to align strategies toward specific or relevant sustainability goals (Gómez-Bezares et al., 2017 ; Sullivan et al., 2018 ; Adams, 2017 ; Ike et al., 2019 ). Nonetheless, companies are facing several difficulties to quickly adapt to this new complex sustainability scenario where goals, targets and indicators exist. According to Schönherr et al. (2017) , achieving the SDGs is hindered by a fundamental difficulty, i.e., the limited knowledge of the actual impact of sustainability practices on SDGs. The 2030 Agenda offers an opportunity to transform the dominant approaches to economic, social, and environmental challenges (Stevens and Kanie, 2016 ). KPMG (2018)  indicates that four out of ten of the world's 250 largest companies currently discuss SDGs in their sustainability reports; and these companies have prioritized one or two SDGs, focusing on target level during the period 2016–2018. According to Van Zanten and Van Tulder (2018) , companies are more likely to engage in those SDGs which are internally actionable throughout their value chains, rather than those whose enactment depends upon elements outside their control. Prioritizing the implementation of some SDGs certainly helps the enactment of other ones. Nonetheless, their integrative and indivisible characteristics cannot be disregarded. Dang et al. (2019)  state that assessing SDGs at a target level reveals that many goals are complementary, some even contradictory. Approaching SDGs at a target level is also too subjective to interpretation, and the utilization of different assessment and measurement methods can lead to diverse conclusions about their achievement (Stafford-Smith et al., 2016 ). SDG reporting is at the center of growing attention from various researchers (e.g., Rosati and Faria, 2019a ; Silva, 2021 ; van der Waal and Thijssens, 2020 ). By reporting on the SDGs, companies improve the management of their efforts towards the achievement of global goals (Rosati and Faria, 2019a ; Ordonez-Ponce and Khare, 2020 ). According to Szennay et al. (2019) , the experience gained, and know-how developed during the reporting practices may be a starting point to understand the sustainability commitment of companies and their contribution to SDGs. Sustainability reports are mostly published under the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standard that presents a comprehensive set of measures to assess the companies’ contribution to SDGs (Bebbington and Unerman, 2018 ; Rosati and Faria, 2019a ; Szennay et al., 2019 ; Stafford-Smith et al., 2016 ). Thus, GRI standards can aid companies in reporting their impact on the SDGs (García-Sánchez et al., 2020 ). Nonetheless, many authors stress the need to develop managerial tools, frameworks, methods and indicators to better understand the engagement of the companies in contributing to the SDGs (Buhmann et al., 2019 ; Dahlmann et al., 2019 ; Bebbington and Unerman, 2018 ; Hák et al., 2016 ). Other authors point out that the reporting of the SDGs barely exceed a symbolic level, i.e., sustainability reports only mention the SDGs (Rosati and Faria, 2019a ; van der Waal and Thijssens, 2020 ; van der Waals et al., 2021 ; Silva, 2021 ). Starting from this premise, this paper presents an assessment framework to investigate the level of the companies' engagement in reporting and managing their contributions and their progress in achieving the SDGs. The framework utilizes two numerical indices and a positioning matrix; thus allowing companies’ managers both a quick comparison with competitors and an overview of the overall behaviour of the sector regarding the measurement and monitoring of the SDGs. A matrix is particularly fit to help organizations mapping their initiatives, strategies and their contributions to the SDGs, and to identify how they are dealing with the SDGs (Grainger-Brown and Malekpour, 2019 ; Calabrese et al., 2021 ). The framework differs from previous studies that use keyword search for SDG presence in the sustainability reports (e.g., Silva, 2021 ; van der Waal and Thijssens, 2020 ) overcoming the symbolic approach issue by testing the accuracy of the SDG reporting. Unlike other studies that measure reporting accuracy at the level of SDG targets (e.g., Tsalis et al., 2020 ; Pizzi et al., 2020b ), the proposed framework analyzes the accuracy of the SDG reporting at the level of SDG indicators examining the correspondence between GRI indicators and SDG indicators. The framework offers the companies' managers the possibility to detect those SDG indicators, and consequently the related GRI indicators, which should be the object of their attention. The matrix and the two indices allow to identify the areas of intervention, that is the SDG indicators (therefore targets and goals) to which the company should pay more attention. The resulting analysis makes it possible to orient the reporting process towards those areas that have the greatest need for accuracy and coverage. Furthermore, the analysis allows company managers to identify the most suitable strategies for the development of sustainability towards achieving the SDGs. An exemplificative application of the framework on a group of major European energy companies’ sustainability reports is presented to provide practitioners and managers with a guideline of how the framework should be employed. The following Section 2  presents the theoretical background regarding SDGs at the corporate level and SDG reporting. Section 3  describes the assessment framework. Section 4  presents the results and discussion; and finally, section 5  states the conclusions.  2 Theoretical background 2.1 Corporate engagement with the SDGs The 17 SDGs are the result of multilateral negotiations based upon the 2012 Rio+20 Conference's final report, “The Future We Want” (Stevens and Kanie, 2016 ; Jayasooria, 2016 ). They represent the institutional framework to achieve sustainability, resulting from the effort of governments, businesses, think tanks, and society (Gupta and Vegelin, 2016 ; Jayasooria, 2016 ; Caiado et al., 2018 , Van Zanten and Van Tulder, 2018 ). In 2017, the A/RES/71/313 resolution has been adopted as an instrument for the accountability of SDGs. The resolution sets the global indicator framework for the SDGs and targets, publishing 244 indicators and complementing the 2030 Agenda. These indicators aim to deliver accessible, timely, reliable, and guaranteed confrontable information on the SDGs, facilitating a systematic follow-up at the various levels. The 2030 Agenda emphasizes the various stakeholders’ roles in implementing the SDGs including the private sector ranging from micro-enterprises, to cooperatives, to multinationals (United Nations, 2015 ). According to Pizzi et al. (2020a) , although the achievement of the SDGs is assessed at the national level, the private sector represents one of the critical factors in achieving the SDGs. Topple et al. (2017)  see the introduction of the seventeen SDGs as one of the main driving forces leading companies toward sustainability, while Rauter et al. (2017)  explain that the private sector can be a catalyst or an obstacle in achieving the SDGs because of its ability to innovate business and to impact society. Indeed, some of the objectives of the 2030 Agenda cannot be achieved without the collaboration of companies due to the externalities produced by their activities. These represent one of the main threats to achieving SDGs, especially in sectors where legislation is lacking (Vazquez-Brust et al., 2020 ). The introduction of the SDGs has been driving companies to develop new business models exploiting innovative solutions, partnerships, financing, and market opportunities (Madsen, 2020 ; Rosati and Faria, 2019a ; Moldavska and Welo, 2019 ; Morioka et al., 2017 ). Companies that consider the SDGs an opportunity, to the point of integrating the goals in their strategies, are subsequently able to redesign their corporate business, create new market areas and innovative services based on the SDGs (Madsen, 2020 ; Madsen and Ulhøi, 2021 ). According to Isaksson (2018) , SDGs are the pillars aiding companies to “visualize how a sustainable future will look like.” Several authors describe the private sectors' important role in achieving the SDGs because of the companies' ability to innovate and to mobilize resources, technology, and finances (Tsalis et al., 2020 ; Caiado et al., 2018 ; Sullivan et al., 2018 ; Muff et al., 2017 ). For these reasons, human resource competencies such as green creativity and leadership are becoming ever more relevant as they help organizations steer towards sustainable development and the SDGs' achievement (Ogbeibu et al., 2020 , 2021a , 2021b ). Even if the private sector is considered a key factor in achieving the SDGs, Ike et al. (2019)  note that there is a lack of research on the implementation of the SDGs at the corporate level; and that it is unclear how the private sector can operationalize and achieve the SDGs through corporate sustainability. Although the SDGs should be considered of equal importance, companies must clarify and prioritize their implementation (Ike et al., 2019 ). In addition, Leagnavar et al. (2016)  suggest that the private sector's role in achieving SDGs may rely upon the definition of their core business activities. Thus, the SDGs' voluntary nature has encouraged giving priority to the implementation of one or two of them, without defining specific implementation methods (Stevens and Kanie, 2016 ; Van Zanten and Van Tulder, 2018 ). Furthermore, Sullivan et al. (2018)  observe that the SDGs guide companies in focusing their strategies on specific sustainability goals using these as an opportunity to identify new businesses and to engage their stakeholders. Nevertheless, the companies' awareness of SDGs is often limited. Some companies consider the SDGs too complicated to implement as there are too many indicators to be understood, even for a single goal; other ones commit to many SDGs without knowing that each goal has numerous indicators to refer to (Gunawan et al., 2020 ). Van Zanten and Van Tulder (2018)  further the discussion by describing the ability of a company to act effectively on a SDG target/indicator (i.e., actionability of SDGs). The actionability of a target/indicator may be categorized as internal or external. The internally actionable SDG targets may be defined as those that “can be engaged within the company or throughout their value chains. Hence these SDG targets fall in a company's sphere of influence” (Van Zanten and Van Tulder, 2018 ). As to externally actionable SDG targets/indicators, these authors explain the difficulties of achievement because of their dependency upon collective activities, involving partnerships with governments, unions, corporations, etc. They explain that enterprises are more likely to contribute to sustainability through those targets/indicators which are internally actionable.  2.2 The SDG reporting SDG reporting is the practice of companies publicly disclosing their commitment to fulfill the 2030 Agenda demands (Rosati and Faria, 2019a ; GRI, 2018a ). According to Szennay et al. (2019) , the experience and know-how developed during the reporting practices may be a starting point to understand the sustainability commitment of companies and their contribution to SDGs. Isaksson (2019)  explains that the sustainability reporting process aims to advise stakeholders on “how the reporting organization is working with sustainable development.” The private sector is not yet able to identify the tools needed to assess its contribution to the SDGs and focuses on a limited number of SDGs (PWC, 2018 , 2019 ). Di Vaio and Varriale (2020)  highlight that many companies are committed to the SDGs, but they ignore how to assess their efforts in meeting the SDGs due to an evident lack of reporting guidelines. The same authors, aligning with previous literature (e.g., Rosati and Faria, 2019a , 2019b ), emphasize the significant role of sustainability reporting as an enabler of actions and strategies focused on the SDGs. According to Rosati and Faria (2019a) , factors such as company size, industry membership and perceived corporate impact play a key role in the companies’ decision to start publishing sustainability reports and to include SDGs in them. Sustainability reports are mainly published under the GRI guidelines, which are widely accepted and increasingly used by organizations to disclose their sustainability commitment and their contribution to SDGs (Lozano et al., 2016 ; Isaksson, 2019 ; Rosati and Faria, 2019a ). The GRI guidelines are particularly suitable in reporting SDGs as they are structured under the triple bottom line (TBL) and indicate a set of specific indicators which can be easily connected to the SDG goals and targets (i.e., GRI, 2020 ). Various authors highlight the usefulness of reporting on GRI standards as a measurement tool for SDGs, enabling companies to understand their contribution in achieving the SDGs (Ordonez-Ponce and Khare, 2020 ; Tsalis et al., 2020 ; Pizzi et al., 2020b ; García-Sánchez et al., 2020 ). In 2015, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), and the World Business Council of Sustainable Development (WBCSD) have published the SDG Compass (GRI et al., 2015 ) that guides companies in aligning their strategies to SDGs, as well as measuring and managing their contribution to the SDGs. The SDG Compass features a generic five-step process based on SDG targets for each business, and this is one of the first attempts to understand the companies' role in achieving the SDGs. The process is organised into five steps: i) Understanding the SDGs; ii) Defining priorities; iii) Setting goals; iv) Integrating; v) Reporting and communicating. The SDG Compass is based on an evolution of the SDG reporting that is indicated in literature (Isaksson, 2019 ; Odważny et al., 2019 ), but it lacks KPIs related to the SDG indicators’ level. Furthermore, in 2018, the GRI and the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) complement the SDG Compass by publishing a set of guidelines named “Business Reporting on SDGs”. GRI continues to develop tools and initiatives aiming to give an increasingly important role to the private sector in measuring and achieving the SDGs. The specific publications “An Analysis of the Goals and Targets” (GRI, 2018b ) and “Linking the SDGs and the GRI Standards” (GRI, 2020 ) detail recommendations of possible disclosure of SDGs at a target level, linking these to a set of possible activities that companies can undertake. The map of correspondence between the SDGs at target level and the GRI indicators makes it easier for organizations to utilize reporting to assess how they impact the SDGs (GRI, 2018b ). Nevertheless, these guidelines require additional work for the SDG indicators’ adaptation and complementation. In fact, the GRI (2018b)  indicates the necessity of more substantial work regarding the gaps where there are no relevant indicators for a particular target and a lack of sector-specific guidance. Furthermore, PWC (2019)  notes that reporting companies are very adept at using sustainability standards’ indicators; but they are not as effective in showing how they match SDG goals, making it difficult to associate their activities with the 2030 Agenda. During the period 2015–2020, literature highlights the necessity of frameworks, methods, and indicators to better understand the contribution of corporate sustainability activities to the SDGs (Buhmann et al., 2019 ; Dahlmann et al., 2019 ; Bebbington and Unerman, 2018 ; Hák et al., 2016 ). In fact, some authors underline the necessity to assess the disclosed information critically because many sustainability reports present a distorted picture, often barely surpassing a symbolic level, i.e., sustainability reports only mention the SDGs (van der Waal and Thijssens, 2020 ; van der Waals et al., 2021 ; Silva, 2021 ). To the best of the authors' knowledge, only Tsalis et al. (2020) , Pizzi et al. (2020b) , and Ordonez-Ponce and Khare (2020)  evaluate the quality of SDG reporting practices at a target level through the GRI standard. Moreover, Tsalis et al. (2020)  are the only authors that propose a methodological framework to assess the quality of corporate sustainability reporting practices regarding SDGs. Nevertheless, focusing on SDGs from a target level is too subjective and can lead to different conclusions regarding the SDGs’ achievement or their contribution (Stafford-Smith et al., 2016 ). Unlike other methods that assess the quality of SDG reporting at the level of SDG targets (e.g., Tsalis et al., 2020 ; Pizzi et al., 2020b ), the proposed framework analyzes the accuracy of SDG reporting at the level of SDG indicators using the correspondence between GRI and SDG indicators. Research has shown that companies are proficient at reporting GRI indicators, but not as competent with SDG indicators, making it more difficult to assess the companies' level of contribution to the 2030 agenda (PWC, 2019 ). Analysis at goal and target level can conceal the symbolic approach often used by companies in SDG reporting (e.g., Silva, 2021 ; van der Waal and Thijssens, 2020 ), making an analysis at indicator level a better tool for comprehensively understanding the companies’ possible contribution and impact on SDGs (PWC, 2018 ). Furthermore, the success of sustainability activities aimed at achieving the SDGs can only improve through feedback and therefore the measurement of the SDG indicators and their monitoring (PWC, 2018 ). Indicator-level analysis improves the assessment of the accuracy of SDG disclosure and limits the challenge of interaction effects and vaguely defined targets and goals. The proposed framework allows the companies’ managers to identify those SDG indicators (therefore targets and goals); to which the company should pay more attention. The resulting analysis makes it possible to orient the reporting process towards those areas that have the greatest need for accuracy and coverage. Furthermore, the proposed assessment framework is aimed to assist companies in understanding if the quality of their SDG disclosures corresponds to their real commitment to achieving the SDGs; and it also indicates how the monitoring process can be improved. Moreover, decision makers can utilize the framework as a strategic management tool allowing companies to analyze their strategic positioning with respect to their competitors in the same sector.   3 The assessment framework Even if the SDGs cannot be obtained without the companies’ contribution, only recently, research literature has begun to consider their fundamental role in their achievement (e.g., Pizzi et al., 2020b ; Silva, 2021 ; Van Zanten and Van Tulder, 2018 ); but the best practice for corporate SDG reporting has yet to be established (GRI, 2018b ; PWC, 2019 ). As explained in the previous sections, the problem that any organization must face regarding SDGs is the extreme complexity of dealing with 17 major goals, 169 targets and 244 indicators. In fact, some companies consider the SDGs too complicated to implement due to the large number of targets and indicators that must be understood, even for a single goal; other companies engage in many SDGs without understanding that each goal has many indicators to refer to (Gunawan et al., 2020 ). Horne et al. (2020)  underline how SDG measurement is challenging as there are interaction effects and vaguely defined goals, creating a challenge to measure progress towards the SDGs comprehensively and consistently. This paper proposes an assessment framework investigating how companies are managing this complex situation, reporting their commitment, and monitoring their progress in achieving the SDGs. The framework proposed in this paper differs from previous analysis tools that use a keywords’ search to determine the presence of SDGs in sustainability reports (e.g., Silva, 2021 ; van der Waal and Thijssens, 2020 ) because it measures not only the presence, but also the accuracy of SDG disclosure, significantly limiting the problem of the symbolic approach often used by companies in sustainability reporting. In the first phase, the proposed framework has utilized content analysis to reduce the number of SDG indicators to internally actionable SDG indicators in that companies can make a direct contribution to them (see Fig. 1  ). Content analysis is an appropriate research method to analyze sustainability reports and the potential contribution to SDGs (Horne et al., 2020 ; Silva, 2021 ). The content analysis of the A/RES/71/313 resolution, entitled “Global Indicator Framework for the Sustainable Development Goals and Targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” (United Nations, 2017 ) has been performed by three researchers, each of whom has had long-time expertise in sustainability. The SDG indicators have been systematically categorized as internally and externally actionable. The categorization of the SDG indicators has been based on the company's direct action on them. The internally actionable SDG indicators can be implemented through the companies' value chain. On the contrary, companies cannot make a significant contribution toward achieving externally actionable SDG indicators without a partnership with other actors (governments, public authorities, etc.). Then, companies are more likely to engage with SDG indicators that can be achieved autonomously, rather than those that cannot be self-implemented (Van Zanten and Van Tulder, 2018 ). The three coders have agreed to select 46 internally actionable SDG indicators with an intercoder reliability of 95.7% that has been calculated using the formula of Miles and Huberman (1994)  and has resulted acceptable (Saldaña, 2010 ). The 46 SDG indicators correspond to 34 targets and 13 goals (Table 1  ). As expected, the number of indicators in Table 1  is not the same for each SDG. In fact, the companies’ achievement of SDG8 exceeds that of other SDGs. The SDG8 (decent work and economic growth) corresponds to the largest number of internally actionable SDG indicators, for a total of 8 indicators aimed at 6 targets. According to Table 1 , companies can also make a major contribution to achieving the SDG6 and the SDG12 both of which have the second-largest target number (4), with 7 and 5 internally actionable SDG indicators, respectively. The SDGs that correspond to externally actionable indicators are not present in Table 1  since their achievement depends on government initiatives or policies; and companies cannot directly contribute to their achievement. The SDGs that are not present in Table 1  are: SDG1 (end poverty); SDG13 (climate action); SDG14 (life below water); and SDG15 (life on land). Thus, these SDGs cannot be achieved within value chain operations and require the cooperation of all sectors of society. Also, Szennay et al. (2019)  have found a poor connection between these four SDGs and reporting practices. The authors indicate that the private sector will play a major role in achieving specific SDGs rather than others. Nonetheless, it does not mean that corporate actors cannot deal with the unrepresented SDGs; but their compliance could be indirect and be based upon the interrelated characteristics of SDGs greatly discussed in the literature (LeBlanc, 2015 ; Barbier and Burgess, 2017 ). The second phase of this framework (Fig. 1 ) utilizes content analysis to associate the SDG indicators selected in the first phase with GRI indicators. The same group of three researchers have carried out the content analysis, taking into account the joint research by the GRI and the UNGC which has been conducted to “help companies understand how they are impacting the SDGs and their targets, by providing a list of indicators to make reporting on the SDGs straightforward and simple to execute” (GRI, 2018b ; GRI, 2020 ). The three coders have agreed on 152 matches between internally actionable SDG indicators and GRI indicators, as shown in Table 2  , with intercoder reliability of 97.36% that has been calculated using the formula of Miles and Huberman (1994)  and has resulted acceptable (Saldaña, 2010 ). Some GRI indicators are used to describe and monitor more than one SDG indicator. For example, the GRI indicator 201–1 (direct economic value generated and distributed) corresponds to 7 SDG indicators; 302–1 (energy consumption within the organization) corresponds to 6 SDG indicators; while the indicators 302–2 (energy consumption outside the organization), 303–1 (interactions with water as a shared resource), 303–3 (water withdrawal) and 306–2 (waste by type and disposal method) correspond to 5 SDG indicators. Table 2  illustrates the correspondence between indicators according to the TBL logic: 14 SDG indicators corresponding to 24 GRI indicators in the economic dimension; 24 SDG indicators corresponding to 73 GRI indicators are classified in the environmental dimension; and 19 SDG indicators corresponding to 59 GRI indicators in the social one. This classification highlights the multidisciplinary and complementary aspects of the SDGs and targets since some SDG indicators belonging to the same target have been classified into two of the three TBL dimensions. For example, the SDG indicator 9.4.1 (CO2  emission per unit of value-added) is classified in both the economic and environmental spheres. The coders have selected 70 different GRI indicators: 33% belonging to the GRI environmental standard (series 300); 40% to the GRI social standard (series 400); 14% to the GRI economic standard (series 200); and 13% to the GRI foundation standard (Series 100). In the third phase (Fig. 1 ), the framework proceeds with the definition of two indicators used to analyze sustainability reports of selected companies: the “SDG Coverage Index” and the “SDG Commitment Index.” The SDG Coverage Index measures to what extent a company is reporting the internally actionable SDGs. The index is calculated as the percentage of GRI indicators in Table 2  that are disclosed in the company's sustainability report. The greater the value of the SDG Coverage Index, the greater the awareness of the company toward the SDGs. The SDG Coverage Index measures the completeness of SDG reporting at an indicator level. The SDG Commitment Index measures the company's involvement in managing and in monitoring SDG achievements. The index is calculated assigning a value from 1 to 4 to each of the GRI indicators in Table 2  that are shown in the company's sustainability report (1 = “qualitative”; 2 = “quantitative”; 3 = “quantitative time series”; 4 = “quantitative time series and future quantitative goal”). The sum of the assigned values is then normalized regarding the maximum obtainable value. The greater the value of the SDG Commitment Index, the greater is the effort of a company in contributing to SDGs by monitoring progress and by aiming for improvement. The SDG Commitment Index measures the quality of the information disclosed, i.e., the accuracy of SDG reporting at an indicator level. In the fourth phase (Fig. 1 ), the assessment framework prescribes the realization of a “SDG matrix”: the Coverage Index is represented on the y-axis and the Commitment Index on the x-axis (see Fig. 2   in Section 6 ). The matrix has four identical quadrants; and the position of a company in one of the quadrants illustrates how much it is involved in reporting and in managing SDGs, especially if compared to other ones in the same sector:• The top right is the high commitment/high coverage (HH) quadrant. These companies are both aware and committed to SDGs. They disclose a high number of indicators (coverage) and provide accuracy of reported data (commitment). Therefore, the companies placed in this quadrant show an appropriate contribution to SDGs.  • The bottom right shows the high commitment/low coverage (HL) quadrant. The companies belonging to this quadrant are managing and monitoring SDGs utilizing a step-by-step strategy: high accuracy of data provided in a limited number of indicators. These companies are committed to contributing to SDGs, but they should measure and monitor more indicators to consolidate their commitment and move towards the HH quadrant.  • The top left is the low commitment/high coverage (LH) quadrant. In this quadrant, the companies have an elevated awareness of SDGs, but they are barely committed to report and to monitor SGDs' progress. These companies are engaging in SDG reporting and monitoring through an incremental improvement strategy: a good level of coverage, but a very low effort in terms of measurement and monitoring. These companies aim to contribute positively to SDGs, as they report a large number of indicators, but they should increase the level of accuracy of the data provided moving towards the HH quadrant.  • At the bottom left, there is the low commitment/low coverage (LL) quadrant. The companies positioned in this quadrant are barely aware (low coverage) and are doing little toward SDG managing and monitoring (low commitment). Poor performance in SDG reporting shows that these companies are far behind their competitors in contributing to the achievement of the SDGs. These companies should engage in reporting a higher number of indicators providing not only their qualitative assessment, but also measuring and monitoring these indicators over time. It is expected that through corrective actions and key interventions the companies located within this area will move to the other quadrants until reaching the HH quadrant.    Finally, the SDG matrix displays the company's values of the two indices of coverage (completeness) and commitment (accuracy) of the SDG reporting; thus allowing the company's managers both a quick comparison with competitors and an overview of the overall behaviour of the sector regarding the measurement and monitoring of the SDGs. The matrix and the two indices make it possible to identify areas of intervention, i.e., SDG indicators (consequently targets and goals) to which the company should pay more attention. The resulting analysis makes it possible to orient the reporting process towards those areas that have the greatest need for accuracy and coverage. Moreover, the analysis allows companies' managers to identify the most suitable strategies for sustainability development toward SDG achievement. The evolutionary trajectory of a company that aims to actively contribute to SDGs must be directed towards the HH quadrant, but also companies already in this quadrant should aim to continually improve moving upwards by showing more awareness and to the right by giving more commitment. To evaluate the suitability of the proposed framework, the next section of the paper illustrates how it should be applied in practice. Energy companies are particularly fit for this purpose because they have a reactive or proactive approach to sustainability as they are exposed to ongoing pressure to address a wide range of sustainability responsibilities that go beyond the legal and environmental (Agudelo et al., 2020 ). Energy companies must adequately respond to stakeholder expectations, local and international regulatory frameworks, and international agreements such as the SDGs (Agudelo et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, energy companies are particularly well suited to provide an example of the application of the framework because according to Aguilera-Caracuel et al. (2017)  and Szczepankiewicz and Mucko (2016)  they have a strategic vision of sustainability as a tool to obtain competitive advantages through a clear differentiation from their competitors. Also, Agudelo et al. (2020)  note that the highest level of attention of researchers in this field has been from Europe. The next section presents an illustrative application of the proposed framework on a set of companies belonging to the European electricity industry to analyze their level of engagement in managing and in monitoring their contributions to SDGs.  4 Results and discussion In the illustrative example, the Italian electricity distribution company A2A SPA (hereafter A2A) is supposed to use the assessment framework proposed in this paper to identify its positioning compared to its main European competitors regarding its SDG disclosure in sustainability reporting. To target the major A2A's European competitors, the first 15 electricity distribution companies of the “Stoxx Europe 600 Utilities” have been considered for comparison (A2A is among them.). The competitors have been reduced to the eight electricity utilities that followed the GRI standard in sustainability reporting: E.ON (Germany), Enel (Italy), RWE (Germany), SSE (the United Kingdom), Iberdrola (Spain), Vattenfall (Sweden), EnBW (Germany), EDP Energias de Portugal (Portugal). It is necessary to specify that the application of the framework to A2A presented in this section is made by way of example and does not constitute an A2A's case study. In fact, A2A's eight competitors could also use this analysis for their benefit. The SDG matrices of Fig. 2  are designed to illustrate to A2A's managers how the other electricity distribution companies are positioned with respect to A2A regarding their involvement in managing and in monitoring their contribution to SDGs. Indeed, the matrices show A2A's performance in the two dimensions of SDG coverage and commitment, allowing both a quick comparison with its competitors and an overview of the overall behaviour of the sector regarding the SDGs. The TBL matrix in Fig. 2  shows A2A and four of its competitors (Iberdrola, Enel, EDP and RWE) in the HH quadrant, three competitors (SSE, Vattenfall and E.ON) in the HL quadrant, one (EnBW) in the LH quadrant, and none in the LL quadrant. Overall, the major players of the electricity distribution sector display a good awareness and commitment to SDGs, also noting that EnBW and SSE are very close to the HH quadrant. In particular, the value of A2A's SDG Coverage Index is 58% against the competitors' average value of 61%; the value of A2A's SDG Commitment Index is 59% against the competitors' average value of 62%. Observing the SDG general matrix, A2A's managers become aware that A2A is in the HH quadrant. Therefore, A2A is well positioned and also shows a balanced level of the two indices; but they are slightly below the average performance of A2A's main companies in the sector. In the economic matrix of Fig. 2 , A2A changes quadrant; and it is collocated in the LH quadrant with two of its competitors (EnBW and RWE). Four competitors (Iberdrola, Enel, EDP and SSE) are in the HH quadrant, one (E.ON) in the HL quadrant, and one (Vattenfall) in the LL quadrant. The major European companies of the electricity distribution sector show overall a good awareness and an adequate commitment to the SDGs of the economic dimension, displaying however a lower Commitment Index than the general one except for EDP. In particular, the value of A2A's SDG Coverage Index in the economic matrix is 83% against the competitors' average value of 67%; the value of A2A's SDG Commitment Index is 42% against the competitors' average value of 51%. The SDG economic matrix reveals to A2A's managers that A2A has an optimal level of coverage, but shows a very low effort in terms of measurement and monitoring accuracy. Even if A2A reports a large number of indicators (above the sector average), the company should dedicate a greater number of resources to increase the level of accuracy of the data provided. The environmental matrix of Fig. 2  portrays A2A once again in the HH quadrant with four of its competitors (Iberdrola, Enel, EDP and EnBW), and the other four competitors (RWE, SSE, Vattenfall and E.ON) in the HL quadrant, none in the LH and the LL quadrants. In the SDG environmental dimension, the analyzed companies present a good awareness and the highest commitment to SDGs except for E.ON that performs better in the social dimension. Precisely, the value of A2A's SDG Coverage Index is 61% against the competitors' average value of 62%; the value of A2A's SDG Commitment Index is 65% against the competitors' average value of 69%. The SDG environmental matrix reveals that A2A has a good and balanced level of the two indices, but its efforts in terms of SDG reporting should increase because A2A falls slightly short of its competitors. Finally, in the social matrix of Fig. 2 , the position of A2A shifts in the HL quadrant with three of its competitors (SSE, Vattenfall and E.ON), two competitors (Iberdrola and Enel) in the HH quadrant, three (EDP, EnBW and RWE) in the LH quadrant, and none in the LL quadrant. Specifically, the value of A2A's SDG Coverage Index in the environmental matrix is 46% against the competitors' average value of 57%; the value of A2A's SDG Commitment Index is 61% against the competitors' average value of 57%. The companies under study present adequate and balanced values of the two indices in the social dimension, showing however the lowest average Coverage Index. Observing the SDG social matrix, A2A's managers have become aware that A2A has an inadequate level of coverage balanced by a good effort in terms of measurement and monitoring accuracy. A2A should measure and monitor a larger number of indicators and consolidate its high commitment. Moreover, Fig. 2  allows a comparison with the best performers among A2A's competitors. Among the analyzed companies, the sustainability strategies of the two best practices are similar; but they differ in approach. Iberdrola has more thorough reporting, whereas Enel is more accurate and detailed. Iberdrola is investing in covering all aspects of internally actionable SDGs, yet Enel's choice undoubtedly demonstrates a greater accuracy in trying to monitor the indicators that show Enel's priorities toward SDGs. These companies are well aware and committed to SDGs' achievement. Besides in all the matrices except the economic one, three of the nine companies (SSE, Vattenfall and E.ON) are engaged in a step-by-step strategy in which few SDGs indicators are pursued and carefully monitored. Further analysis of the positioning matrices shows that EnBW is performing an incremental improvement strategy indicating that this company has a high awareness of SDGs and that its monitoring process should be improved. The A2A's SDG reporting strategy appears well equilibrated in the TBL; and environmental matrices seemingly follow Enel's kind of strategy, incremental as EnBW's one in the economic matrix and a step-by-step strategy in the social one. The analysis of each positioning matrix demonstrates that the most important companies of the electricity distribution sector have a high level of awareness and commitment to the SDGs, particularly to the environmental dimension of the TBL. The companies belonging to this sector are especially sensitive to environmental issues, as their business activities have potential negative externalities regarding environmental impact (Agudelo et al., 2020 ). Moreover, energy companies consider sustainability as a strategic framework that can help achieve competitive advantages through competitive differentiation (Aguilera-Caracuel et al., 2017 ; Szczepankiewicz and Mucko, 2016 ). Fig. 3   of this exemplificative application shows to A2A's managers the SDG Coverage and Commitment Indices of A2A and its competitors regarding their involvement in managing and in monitoring their contribution to SDGs according to a single SDG. A2A performs values higher than its competitors' average ones both in the Coverage and Commitment Indices in three SDGs: SDG4 (quality education) scores respectively 100% against 56%, and 75% against 42%; SDG6 (clean water and sanitation) 56% against 51%, and 55% against 52%; SDG10 (reducing inequalities) 83% against 74%, and 80% against 67%. Instead, both A2A's indices score values much lower than its competitors' in two SDGs: SDG2 (zero hunger) with 0% against 56%, and 0% against 22%; and SDG11 (sustainable cities and communities) with 50% against 56%, and 50% against 57%. The A2A's Coverage Index is above the competitors' average value in eight out of thirteen SDGs (SDG4, SDG5, SDG6, SDG9, SDG10, SDG12, SDG16, SDG17); and A2A's Commitment Index is above the average value in five out of thirteen SDGs (SDG3, SDG4, SDG6, SDG8, SDG10). Also, Fig. 3  allows a comparison with the best performers among A2A's competitors. Analyzing the two best practices of the sector, Iberdrola and Enel, the first one has a Coverage Index greater or equal to Enel's and A2A's in all the SDGs; but Iberdrola's Commitment Index is always below Enel's except for the SDG2, and below A2A's in SDG3, SDG6, SDG8, SDG10, and SDG12. The analysis of the single SDG indicates to A2A's managers that the company is doing well in many areas, but it should improve SDG reporting in other ones. A2A completely lacks in reporting SDG2, and the company should increase the number of disclosed indicators of SDG3, SDG5, SDG8, and SDG11. Finally, A2A's SDG reporting should improve the measurement and monitoring of SDG5, SDG7, SDG9, SDG11, SDG16, SDG17. Furthermore, the proposed framework is the only one in the literature that analyzes the sustainability reports at the SDG indicator level. This allows A2A's decision makers to identify the critical areas that need to be improved through targeted investments. The analysis at the SDG indicator level permits managers to individuate the corresponding GRI indicators that are absent or that need to be improved in terms of accuracy and quality of disclosed information. In this illustrative example, A2A shows a good level of the two indices in the environmental area, but SDG reporting should improve because A2A falls slightly short of its competitors. Observing the analysis on the single SDG, A2A's managers could initially concentrate their attention on increasing the number of disclosed indicators of SDG11. The proposed framework offers A2A's managers the possibility of detecting the SDG indicators, and consequently the associated GRI indicators that should be the object of their attention. Regarding SDG11, A2A′s report lacks GRI indicator 305–7 (nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and other significant air emissions), which is associated with SDG indicator 11.6.2 (annual mean levels of fine particulate matter in cities, population-weighted). In this exemplificative application, there are only five SDGs where the commitment value is higher than the coverage one (SDG3, SDG6, SDG7, SDG8 and SDG11) and their difference is minimal (from 2% to 8%). Whereas in the other SDGs, the coverage value is much greater than the commitment one with the greatest differences observed in SDG2 (60%), SDG17 (36%), and SDG5 (30%). This discrepancy between coverage and commitment raises a question about the presence of a possible symbolic approach in SDG disclosure (e.g., Silva, 2021 ; van der Waal and Thijssens, 2020 ). Overall, the 2030 Agenda appears to be a driving force for the major players of the European electricity distribution sector in many areas and, in particular, in their quest for innovation as SDG9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure) shows the highest commitment value. These findings reinforce the statements of Sullivan et al. (2018) , Hopper (2019) , and Moldavska and Welo (2019)  regarding incentives for the 2030 Agenda for innovations in the private sector. In fact, Sullivan et al. (2018)  stress the necessity to emphasize sustainability-based innovation as a source of competitive advantage.  5 Conclusions The private sector's role in achieving SDGs cannot be underestimated because of its ability to influence stakeholders, to mobilize resources, and to innovate. The introduction of the seventeen SDGs by the UN in 2015 has been seen by the private sector as a major driving force toward sustainability achievement (Topple et al., 2017 ). The number of companies that contribute to the SDGs through their reporting practices are increasing (Ordonez-Ponce and Khare, 2020 ; PWC, 2019 ; Rosati and Faria, 2019a ). In this context, this paper focuses on understanding the companies' efforts in contributing to SDGs by analyzing SDG reporting at an indicator level. The proposed framework is based on the correspondence between SDG indicators and GRI indicators, and it features 152 correspondences in which 13 SDGs and 34 targets and 46 indicators are present. The performed content analysis evidences the interrelated and complementary aspects of the goals, as some indicators of the same goal are classified into two of the three areas of the TBL. The outcomes of content analyses indicate that the number of total internally actionable indicators are not equally presented for each SDG, and even nonexistent for some (e.g., SDG1, end poverty; SDG13, climate action; SDG14, life below water; and SDG15, life on land). The above proposed framework enriches SDG assessment and management aiding companies in recognizing the quality of their sustainability reports by identifying the completeness and accuracy of reporting on SDGs at an indicator level. This framework presents opportunities for practice and research. Researchers can use the framework to further investigate how companies choose a strategy aimed at contributing to the SDGs through the measurement and monitoring of SDG indicators. The use of the Coverage and Commitment Indices, combined in the positing matrix, evidences that some companies prefer to concentrate on reporting a limited number of SDG indicators and to focus on reporting accuracy. Other companies adopt a different strategy: aiming to report as many SDG indicators as possible without going into them (for example, providing only a qualitative description or not stating a future goal). Moreover, practitioners can use the developed framework as a strategic management tool allowing corporate decision makers to analyze the strategic positioning of a company with respect to competitors in the same sector. Companies can use the proposed framework to compare the quality of their sustainability reports with their competitors. These comparisons provide decision makers with feedback to improve the quality of information disclosed in sustainability reports, to understand how the company is positioned regarding competitors, and to individuate sustainability strategies regarding SDGs. Moreover, the proposed framework offers an overview of the overall behaviour of the sector regarding the measurement and monitoring of the SDGs. SDG assessment and management allow companies to identify the most suitable strategies for sustainability development toward SDG achievement. Management can use the results of the framework to reflect critically upon the actual company strategy and potentially change it, while external stakeholders can productively provide suggestions for future changes and be more explicit in their requests. The illustrative example in Section 4  has shown how companies’ managers could use the SDG matrix and indices to analyze the relative position of a limited group of major competing companies about their involvement in managing and in monitoring their contribution to SDGs. The paper has two main limitations. First, by analyzing a limited number of companies, the results of the application cannot be generalized and meaningful statistical analysis cannot be conducted. It is necessary to remember that the application of the framework to A2A does not constitute a case study of A2A, which has been chosen arbitrarily only to show practitioners and managers how to use the framework. Secondly, the results are limited by the selection of a specific sector. Future research aims to use the framework to compare how companies from different sectors are reporting and contributing to the SDGs. Indeed, the positioning matrix should help monitor a sector's progress over time towards SDG contribution and develop cross-sector assessments.
