                  This study attempts to connect Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with energy efficiency for 20 Asian and Pacific (AP) countries using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) from 2000 to 2018. The Panel Correction Standard Error (PCSE) estimates found that sustainable economic development and energy efficiency are positively related, suggesting that sustainable economic development is associated with increased energy efficiency. Similarly, we found that sustainable financial development is also positive, indicating that sustainable financial development increases energy efficiency. In further analyses, we confirmed a positive impact of green innovation on energy efficiency. The S-GMM estimator confirmed similar findings, showing robust to alternative econometric model. Based on these findings, we recommend policies that tend to promote sustainable economic and financial development.

This study attempts to connect Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with energy efficiency for 20 Asian and Pacific (AP) countries using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) from 2000 to 2018. The Panel Correction Standard Error (PCSE) estimates found that sustainable economic development and energy efficiency are positively related, suggesting that sustainable economic development is associated with increased energy efficiency. Similarly, we found that sustainable financial development is also positive, indicating that sustainable financial development increases energy efficiency. In further analyses, we confirmed a positive impact of green innovation on energy efficiency. The S-GMM estimator confirmed similar findings, showing robust to alternative econometric model. Based on these findings, we recommend policies that tend to promote sustainable economic and financial development.   Keywords Data envelope analysis  Energy efficiency  PCSE  S-GMM  Sustainable development    1 Introduction The sudden surge in energy use and carbon dioxide emission (CO2 ) in recent times is alarming. Many believe that the rising population level in urban areas is the brain behind the surge [1 ,2 ], while others argued that goods and services production might be the cause [3 ,4 ]. Whatever may be the case, energy has come to stay as a factor that determines sustainable development. Hence, it has been projected that global industrial sector energy use will rise to about 30% by 2050 [5 ], while consumption of end-products is projected to grow and exceed the approximate figure of 310 quadrillions British Thermal Units (BTU) [5 ]. Given the projection, energy use rise is likely to affect economic activity, society, and the environment. Therefore, governments and policymakers should pay attention to cleaner energy policies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. There are two possible ways to address these issues, that is sustainable financing and economic development. Energy has been driven by sustainable development and growth [6 ], which means an economy's growth increases energy demand. If energy is constrained, economic growth pulls back in turn. This shows the bidirectional relationship that exists between sustainable development and growth in energy efficiency. Furthermore, financial development could affect energy demand by protecting customers from borrowing money to buy items such as automobiles, houses, refrigerators, air conditioners, and washing machines. In other words, financial development provides an easier path for customers to satisfy their needs and wants, which can affect a country's overall demand for energy [7 ]. Following the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)- 7, there is the need for cheaper, affordable, and clean energy. Putting it differently, the provision of energy efficiency and reduction in carbon dioxide emissions becomes necessary by 2030 [8 ]. Hussaini [9 ] argued that energy efficiency, as often used as the term for technology, appears behavioral in practice but refers to the economic value of fuel consumption. On the other hand, energy efficiency provides an effective and efficient energy cost for producing output and services [10,11 ]. More importantly, it reduces carbon dioxide emissions, reduces demand for energy import, and lowers the cost on the individual household and economy as a whole [12 ]. Beyond this, buildings, transportations, industries, and energy generation sectors benefit from energy efficiency. Against this background, we focussed on energy efficiency and sustainable development for economic and financial factors vital for energy efficiency. Countries with sustainable development foresight must embrace energy efficiency and carbon dioxide reduction policies [13 ]. However, previous studies [13–15 ]) focused on economic growth and financial development as a determinant of energy efficiency. We argued that economic growth focuses on producing goods and services without considering the environmental consequences that expose the lapses of using economic growth as the determinant of energy efficiency. Secondly, prior literature [15–18 ]; considered financial development to determine energy efficiency. This indicator reflects financial base growth, while the future generation is exposed to uncertainty. Thirdly, the Asian region top the continents as the most energy secured region, with 7 of its member countries ranked among the world's most attractive renewable energy source markets [19 ]. Despite this growth of the energy market in Asia, little has been done to research how to promote energy efficiency using SDGs. It will be unfair to side-line these nations' tenacity in upholding clean energy system policies in our study. Given this fact, we considered 20 Asian and Pacific countries and investigated the role of sustainable development goals (i.e., sustainable economic and financial development) in promoting energy efficiency. Secondly, we estimate the impact of green innovation in achieving energy efficiency. We used DEA analysis to construct the energy efficiency index, while the Panel Correction Standard Error (PCSE) model and robustness of the S-GMM estimator to achieve our target objectives. Our study makes incremental contributions to literature and practice in several ways. First, this study enriches the literature on energy efficiency by focusing on the country-level outcome. Most of the existing literature [20 ,21 ] largely dominates by firm-level studies. We argue that the government provides and regulates the energy market in most Asian and Pacific countries, enabling firms’ access and affordable energy. The government has the power and motivation to influence energy saving or efficiency improvement; hence, the country-level study on the energy efficiency of the environment is essential. Thirdly, we contribute to the literature on the sustainable economy by focusing on the effect of nexus between development in terms of income and efficient consumption of energy as compared with previous research [14 ] and Chang 2015) that provided analysis of economic development and financial development such as economic growth. We argued that sustainable economic and financial development is emerging as a critical area nation find better ways to manage the economy without jeopardizing the future generation. Although our study shared similarities with Ziolo et al. [22 ]; we argued that our study provides more robust findings of energy efficiency nexus because we focussed on top renewable energy countries in the world. As done in Ziolo et al. [22 ]; lumping more countries into renewable energy driving countries may produce biased results. Arguably, usage or consumption of renewable energy and regulations matter in many countries in Asia and the Pacific (Consultancy.asia, 2020). Fourthly, we extended the energy efficiency nexus by including the green innovation nexus. This paper is prepared by keeping in mind the following. Section 2 , present the literature review, while the research methodology employed herein are reported in section 3 . Section 4  shows the results and discussion based on empirical data sets collected for the study. We concluded and made a policy recommendation in Section 5 .  2 Literature review It is clear from the United Nations –UN -SDG goal – 7 that it is globally becoming acceptable to source affordable and accessible clean energy. The global climate and environmental issues are major reasons behind the sudden surge in energy efficiency [23–25 ]. However, others believe that companies and firms' quest for profits is also the one-side reason for energy efficiency [20 ,21 ]. Be that as it may, be; it is the reality that energy efficiency holds more benefits to tap from. Therefore, the promotion of energy efficiency became very important in the mind of the progressive. Hence, we review the existing literature on their suggested ways to promote energy efficiency. One factor that can improve energy efficiency is by sustaining economic development. For instance, implementing renewable energy has a significant cost burden; however, selling carbon credit can offset this cost burden, leading to indirect health benefits [26–28 ]. Another way to achieve energy efficiency in a country is to over-hold its economic activities, considering the health of our environment. That means promoting economic growth and energy consumption is not out of place while considering energy efficiency [14 ,29 ]. Rosen [30 ] argued that countries with sustainable economic development could draw from their success only by focusing on discovering sustained energy resources. Financial development is another factor that significantly drives energy efficiency [31 ]. Through energy intensity, financial development spurs energy efficiency. Specifically, the development of the finance system tends to bring relief to energy users by giving confidence in the possibility of outsourcing finance for energy, which consequently increases energy efficiency [16 ]. In support, Chang (2015) argued that financial development indicators could promote energy efficiency through energy consumption. However, the magnitude of this impact depends on the income level and the aspect of financial development. For example, private and domestic credit primarily increase energy consumption and energy-saving or efficiency in low-income countries. However, Li et al. [17 ] argued that energy efficiency could be negatively affected, which means it can witness a downturn. The possible factor in the downturn of energy efficiency is urbanization. Urbanization prompts a larger migration of rural population to an urban area, leading to an increase in energy usage and consumption. Because of the divergence in the living conditions of urban and rural residents, the surge in energy consumption will reduce energy efficiency and unnecessary energy waste. More so, urbanization leads to unemployment in the rural area, as such government is forced to seek for solution to the rising unemployment and sometimes demand to relax some environmental regulation on selected enterprises known for high energy consumption and look up to them to provide more job opportunities, which also likely to reduce energy saving or efficiency [18 ]. Similarly, financial development reduces energy efficiency in high-income countries, specifically the value of traded stocks and stock market turnover (Chang, 2015). There are quite a few studies concerning energy saving or efficiency, sustainable financing, and economies worldwide. However, the previous studies, such as Ziolo et al. [22 ]; emphasized the OECD economies while neglecting the countries that are most attracted to clean energy. According to a news report by EY, Asia is growing to the top of the globe as the continent with the most attractive renewable energy use (Consultancy.asia, 2020). As we know, renewable energy forms part of energy efficiency. It would not be wise to exclude countries that have embraced renewable energy use in their system, unlike the previous literature, which ignored the countries with higher renewable energy demand. Given this fact, the findings from previous studies may not reflect the reality of the nexus between energy efficiency and sustained economy. Secondly, previous studies failed to account for the innovation related to environmental performance, despite the global calls for a green economy and environment. We are motivated by this shortfall to examine the role of nexus for development in terms of income and efficient energy consumption in the AP countries while accounting for green innovation.  3 Data and econometric method 3.1 Sample data This study employs a panel dataset consisting of 20 Asia and Pacific countries between 2000 and 2018. Data selection was subjected to data availability, and details of our variables and source are reported in Table 1   , while the list of sampled countries is presented in Appendix A . Furthermore, the choice of Asia and Pacific countries is due to the position it holds being among the top energy users and the most stringent in environmental policies region in the world (see Table 2 ).  3.2 Theoretical background and model specification Following prior studies [22 ,32 ], we constructed Total Factor Energy Efficiency (TFEE) using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) enveloped in stata software. Coelli [33 ] argued that linear mathematical techniques could measure the efficiency of decision-making units (DMU). Going by that assertion, Total Factor Energy Efficiency (TFEE) is calculated by taking the division of the actual energy input over energy input as demonstrated by Hu and Wang [34 ] in the following equation:(1) TFEE  ( i , t  )  = T E I  ( i , t  )   A E I  ( i , t  )    = A E I  ( i , t  )  − T A ( i , t )   A E I  ( i , t )         As eq (1)  the index TFEE represents the efficiency level of energy consumption in a country, T E I    is the target energy inputs in a country, and A E I    represents the actual energy inputs of a country. The target energy input is the minimum energy input in a country; therefore, the actual energy input is larger than or equal to target energy inputs, making TFEE equal to zero or unity. In essence, a unity TFEE score occurs when actual energy inputs of DMU are equal to targeted energy inputs, indicating higher energy efficiency. However, the TFEE score is zero when the actual energy input is far away from the targeted energy inputs, suggesting low energy efficiency. Therefore, we follow the previous studies [35 ,36 ] and [22 ,37–41 ]), assess the role of sustainable economic and financial development on the energy efficiency of 20 Asian and Pacific countries. We specify our baseline model as follows:(2) T o t a l  f a c t o r  e n e r g y  e f f i c i e n c y i t   = β 0  +  β 1  s u s t a i n e d  e c o n o m i c  d e v e l o p m e n t i t   +  ε i t       (3) T o t a l  f a c t o r  e n e r g y  e f f i c i e n c y i t   = β 0  +  β 1  s u s t a i n e d  f i n a n c i a l  d e v e l o p m e n t i t   +  ε i t        As eq (2)  assesses the role of sustainable economic development on energy efficiency, while eq (3)  shows the relationship between sustainable financial development and energy efficiency. Where “i”  refer to country, “t”  is the year and “ε   ” is the error term. All other variables are defined in Table 1 , while Fig. 1   demonstrates the sequence of methodology as follows:1. The pre-estimation analysis is the criteria for adopting the estimation model by conducting a unit root test. The condition for adopting OLS-PCSE is for all variables to be stationary at either level or first difference or a mixture of them.  2. Baseline estimation, we test for OLS-PCSE estimation on the variables under consideration.  3. Alternative estimation, we estimate another alternative variable of interest using the OLS-PCSE estimator.    4. Robustness estimation is a post-analysis estimate. We check the possibility of changes in the main finding following the inclusion of lags of dependent and independent variables and check for endogeneity using OLS-PCSE and S-GMM models, respectively.  3.3 Estimation method 3.3.1 Unit-root test In this section, we estimate for stationarity of the variables. To achieve this, we perform LLC and HTT unit-root tests to show if there is stationary or not in the series [42 ]. LLC and HTT unit-root tests are fantastic tests because they offer more reliability. The general form of the model considered in this paper can be written as follows:y i t   =  α i  +  δ t +  μ i t    t = 1 , …. T :  i = 1 , …. N     u i t   = ρ u i , t − 1   + ε i t    ε i t   ∼ { 0 , σ t 2   σ ε 2  ( i )   }      y i t   = ( 1 − ρ  )  α i  + ( 1 − ρ  )  δ t +  p y i , t − 1   +  ε i t    / ρ / < 1     o r  y i t   =  y i ,  t − 1   +  δ +  ε i t    ε i t    ∼ { 0 ,  σ t 2   σ ε 2   ( i )  }   ρ = 1       3.3.2 Ordinary least square with panel corrected standard error (OLS-PCSE) Beck and Katz [43 ] developed the PCSE model to overcome the shortcomings posed by Time Series Cross-Section (TCSC) model using OLS procedures. Meanwhile, OLS has been criticized due to the presence of non-spherical error and the inability of the model to provide consistent estimates. Therefore, the PCSE model is an alternative for the OLS model because it provides accurate estimation in contemporaneously correlated or heteroskedastic panel errors. Given the following equation:(4) y i t   =  θ y i t − 1   +  x i t   β +  ε i t        Accepting that the blunders in condition (4) are time-related autonomous, the change covariance framework of the mistakes can be built as follows:(5) Ω =  Σ ⊗ I T      Where Σ    is the N x N lattice of mistake differences and contemporaneous covariances and ⨂ address the Kronecker item. Given Σ    refer to the T x N grid of the OLS residuals. E'E/T gives a predictable gauge of Σ. PCSEs are accordingly assessed by the square base of the askew of:(6) ( X ′  X )  − 1   X ′   ( E ′  E  T   ⊗ I T   )   X ( X ′  X )  − 1         3.3.3 System generalized moment of method (S-GMM) We employed the system, Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimators, to capture the dynamic models of panel data as first use by (Arellano and Bond [44 ] and Arellano and Bover [45 ]. The standard system, GMM, in levels (1) and in first difference (2) are summarised as follows:(7) Y i t   = σ 0  + σ 1  Y i t − τ   + σ 2  X 1 i t   + σ 3  X 2 i t   + σ 4  X 3 i t   + ∑  h = 1  5  δ j  W h , i , t − τ    + η i  + ξ t  + ε i t       (8) Y i t   − Y i t − τ   = σ 1  ( Y i t − τ   − Y i t − 2 τ    )  + σ 2  ( X 1 i t − τ   − X 1 i t − 2 τ    )  + σ 3  ( X 2 i t − τ   − X 2 i t − 2 τ    )   + σ 4  ( X 3 i t − τ   − X 3 i t − 2 τ    )  σ 1  Y i t − τ   + σ 2  X 1 i t   + σ 3  X 2 i t   + σ 4  X 3 i t    + ∑  h = 1  5  δ j  ( W h , i , t − τ    − W h , i , t − 2 τ    )  + ( ξ t  − ξ t − 2 τ    )  + ( ε i t   − ε i t − 2 τ   )       Note that Y i t      is the dependent variable of country i    at period  t    ; σ 0     is a constant, while τ    represents the coefficient of autoregression which presents specifications that take into cognizance the issues in degrees of freedom. The coefficient X 1 , X 2 , X 3    are independent variables; W    show the vector of control variables, η i     is the country-specific effect, ξ t     is the time-specific constant and ε i t      the error term. The S-GMM estimation following three sets of procedures, which are identification, simultaneity, and exclusion restrictions [46,47 ]; Asongu and Odhiambo, (2019a & b) and Tchamyou [46 ]. First, the S-GMM assumed that all independent variables are suspected to be endogenous variables. Therefore, adopted “gmmstyle” for predetermined variables, in which years are treated as strictly exogenous, and the method for treating the ivstyle (years) is “iv (years, eq (diff)).” This is because the years cannot become endogenous in first-difference [47] . This process is known as identification. Simultaneously, lagged values of regressors are included as instruments, which remove fixed effects that are seen influencing the assessed relationships. In this case, Helmet transformations are advised to be performed for the regressors, which transformations embody the mean differencing of the indicators: the mean of future observations is subtracted from the variables instead of deducting the previous observations for the contemporaneous one [46 ]. These transformations provided same-level conditions between forwarding differenced variables and lagged values. This condition does not care about the number of lags because the set-aside target minimizes data loss, with the exemption of the last observation for each country. Lastly, the exclusion restriction is the process by which the dependent variable is influenced by the strictly exogenous variables exclusively through the endogenous explaining variables. The difference in Hansen Test is used to assess the validity of the exclusion restriction for instrument exogeneity. Notably, the standard instrumental variable approach rejects the null hypothesis of the Sargan Over identifying Restrictions test. This means that instruments do not outline the outcome variable via the suspected endogenous variables. At the same time, in the GMM estimation technique, the Difference in Hansen Test is the required information criterion used to investigate if years are strictly exogenous.    4 Results and discussions 4.1 Univariate analysis Table 3   presents the descriptive statistics of the variables. The statistical information is presented in the following order: mean, 1st, 90th,  and standard deviation. The mean of Total factors energy efficiency  is 3906.501, suggesting more than 3000 units of energy efficiency were used among the sampled countries. However, the standard deviation is higher, indicating high variation among the sampled countries; specifically, Hong Kong has the highest energy efficiency (see Fig. 2  ). This may be due to their stringent policy on cleaner energy consumption. Among the sustainable economic development variables (modified /adjusted net saving, GDP of countries  per capita, industry-specific value-added, urbanization, and renewable energy consumption ), we observed a similar trend except for urbanization  with the mean value of 53.746 and a very small standard deviation, suggesting small variation among the sampled countries. Furthermore, most of the variables of sustainable financial development (i.e., domestic or institutional credit facilities for the private sector, financial market, financial institution, and health expenditure ) show a low standard deviation value, indicating small variation among the sample countries. In contrast, research and development  and foreign direct investment  show high standard deviation, suggesting high variation among sampled countries.  4.2 Multivariate analysis 4.2.1 Main results Table 4   show the regression results, and we presented the results base on the sustainable development for the variables which are connected in terms of economic benefits (i.e., adjusted net saving, GDP  per capita, industry value-added, urbanization, and renewable energy consumption ) in column 1, while (in) column 2, we reported the sustainable development for the variables (i.e., domestic credit to the private sector, financial market, financial institution research and development, expenditure on health infrastructure and foreign direct investment ). The coefficient of adjusted net saving, industry value-added, and renewable energy consumption (1.405∗∗∗, 1.473∗∗∗, 1.668∗∗∗, and 0.411∗∗∗) are positive and significant at 1%, suggesting that adjusted net saving, industry value-added, and renewable energy consumption are attached with the increase of energy efficiency for Asia and Pacific. This follows the assertion that individual and organization per capita income increases in an economic development environment while the energy sector remains competitive. Hence, people have more income to spend on competitive energy and achieve optimization. This is partly consistent with Razzaq et al. [48 ] and Liimatainen and Pöllänen [49 ]; who found that sectoral economic development promotes energy efficiency. However, we found that the coefficient of urbanization (−1.668∗∗∗) is negative and significant at 1%, indicating that urbanization reduces energy efficiency. This is possible because the migration of people to urban areas from their native or rural areas increases energy consumption and energy wastage due to the rural habit of carelessness for energy usage. This finding is consistent with Lv et al. [50 ]; Oryani et al. [51 ]; and Li et al. [17 ]; who found that urbanization causes a reduction in energy efficiency. Overall, sustainable economic development promotes energy efficiency, suggesting saving, industrialization, and renewable energy consumption to meet UN sustainable development goal −7 (affordable and clean energy). In the case of sustainable financial development, we found that domestic credit to the private sector, capital markets, financial institutions, R&D spending, health spending, and foreign direct investment (0.538∗∗∗, 2.286∗∗∗, 2.234∗∗∗, 0.125∗∗∗, 1.427∗∗∗, and 0.833∗∗∗) are positive and significant at 1%, an indication that domestic facilities for credit facilitation for the private sector, financial market, financial institution, expenditure on innovation (R&D), expenditure on health infrastructure and foreign direct investment  has an increasing influence on the energy efficiency in the Asian and Pacific countries. Put it differently, it means the sustainable financial development variables are associated with increased energy efficiency. One possible reason for the positive influence is that financial institutions offer funds to individuals and firms through loans and grants to enable them to expand their production base. In essence, firms can purchase more innovative energy systems to achieve energy efficiency. This is partly consistent with Mukhtarov et al. [52 ] and Sadorsky [7 ]; who found that financial development promotes energy consumption.  4.2.2 The effect of the green innovation The previous analysis on the relationship between sustainable economic and financial development and energy efficiency has been represented in Table 4 , but this estimation largely ignores any external pressure that could change the direction of energy efficiency. In practice, technological innovations are cheaper and environmental friendly; hence, they are likely to achieve energy efficiency and optimization [53 ]. Many countries encourage innovation activities to achieve specific objectives such as productivity and environmental performance. Therefore, we carried out the test on whether other policies such as green innovation affects energy efficiency. For this reason, we introduced a new equation; Green innovation  is a variable that measures the total number of patents in environmental-related technologies. The results are presented in Table 5  , and the coefficient of green innovation (1.8907∗∗∗) is positive and significant at 1%, suggesting that green innovation promotes energy efficiency. This is possible because green innovations are smarter, cheaper, and environmentally friendly. Hence, they are cost-effective, and therefore, energy efficiency can be achieved. To put it differently, green innovation can promote environmental performance through energy efficiency without harming the economy. This is consistent with Sun et al. [54 ]; who found that green innovation and institutional quality promote energy efficiency. Column 2 presents the regression analysis of green innovation with alternative control variables (sustainable financial development). The results show that the coefficient of green innovation (1.3507∗∗) is positive and significant at 5%, indicating that green innovation promotes energy efficiency. The finding is a robust alternative to our finding in column 1.   4.3 Robustness and endogeneity (lagged and S-GMM) In this section, we test the reliability of our model in light of our main results in Table 4 . This becomes necessary to have reliable findings and a stable model. Secondly, reverse causality is also possible; hence, we employed different econometric identification to address these concerns. Firstly, we included the country and year effect to capture the time-varying country-effect on energy efficiency. As presented in Table 6  , the results indicate that sustainable economic and financial development variables  remain positive and significant; this is consistent with the main results in Table 4 . Secondly, we considered the effect of the lag of the energy efficiency, adjusted net saving, and domestic credit to the private sector . To do this, we took the lag of energy efficiency, adjusted net saving, and domestic credit to the private sector separately, and the results are presented in Table 7  . The results show that the effects on energy efficiency remain positive under the lag of energy efficiency, adjusted net saving, and domestic credit to the private sector. This is not quantitatively different from the main results in Table 4 . Thirdly, following Wang et al. [55 ], we employed the System-Generalized Method of Moments (S-GMM) by Arellano and Bond [44 ] to address omitted variable bias. As presented in Table 8  , the results show that our main finding that sustainable economic development and financial development variables are significantly related to energy efficiency is robust.   5 Conclusion and policy implications We have examined the relationship between sustainable economic developments, financial development energy efficiency. Unlike prior studies on energy efficiency [22 ], we extended the scope by focusing on the countries with the highest renewable energy use and considering a specific type of innovation where government policies are relevant. Our data covered 20 countries of Asia and the Pacific between 2000 and 2018, and the region has been recognized among the top energy-intensive economies. Given this fact, we introduced green innovation to ascertain the effort of these countries in maintaining a green environment. Green innovation is measured as the number of patents in environmental-related technologies and is sourced from OECD Statistics (2021). Data on energy efficiency was calculated using DEA methods, while sustainable economic and financial development variables were collected from the World Bank and the IMF Database. In the light of this, we employed robust econometric modeling, which shows that sustainable economic development significantly drives energy efficiency in Asia and the Pacific regions. More specifically, we found that investment for sustainable economic development is an option to increase energy efficiency. The analogy here is that every individual and organization is well better off under a well-developed economic system. Given this, the energy market becomes competitive, where individuals or organizations buy energy at a very competitive price, leading to energy efficiency. Similarly, we found that sustainable financial development promotes energy efficiency; this relies upon the assertion that financial institutions such as banks can fund businesses given sustainable financial development. Therefore, stakeholders in the energy sectors can purchase energy and sell at a cheaper rate, leading to energy efficiency. We also tested the green innovation view theory and the relationship between energy efficiency. According to this theory, green innovation may pressure the government and companies to deviate from using non-environmental friendly energy. Our results indicate that green innovation is positively related to energy efficiency, suggesting that our findings are sensitive to green innovation. Finally, using robust econometric identification strategies such as the lag of variables and S-GMM, the result of this paper demonstrates that empirical analysis has not faced any potential problems from endogeneity. Following our findings, our study first recommends that countries in the Asian and Pacific regions should maintain higher energy efficiency rates by promoting sustainable economic development. The possible ways to improve sustainable economic development are:1) The tax and benefit system:  Government should intervene by promoting equity to reduce inequality as well as poverty. Through the tax and benefit system, the government can apply a progressive tax  that takes more from the higher income earners and redistributes for the welfare of lower-income earners. The establishment of National Insurance Funds will help map out and distribute contributory benefits such as pensions and job-seekers allowance.  2) Industrialization:  Government should initiate a process towards industrialization. Such a process includes public-private partnerships, technology and innovation, and creating a comparative advantage, where both parties invest in the industry's setup and operation. More so, technologies and innovation funds initiatives for industrialization should be established to flourish innovation and foster speedy industrialization. While creating a comparative advantage will help resource utilization and distribution.  3) Promotion of public utilities : Countries can also improve economic development by increasing spending on public goods such as education, public transport, and healthcare. Therefore, a free public utility scheme should be put in place to improve the welfare of lower-income earners and would be fund by the progressive tax.    Secondly, free-market economy (supply side) policies are also instruments for sustainable financial development. The possible way to improve sustained financial systems are:1) Privatization of state-owned financial institutions:  The public-owned financial institutions could be offered for privatization by initiating a public enterprise where the higher bidder and the most expertise are offered. This is critical in improving financial system performance because it is associated with lower costs, lower prices, and higher operating efficiency.  2) Promotion of foreign direct investment:  Set up an Investment Promotion Agency (IPA) to target suitable foreign investors and become the link between the investor and the financial institution. On the one side, it should act as a one-stop shop for requirements investors demand from the host country. On the other side, it should serve as a catalyst in the host's financial institution, prompting it to provide top-notch infrastructure and ready access to skilled workers and managers that may be required to attract such investors.    Despite the robustness of our findings, this study is not without limitations. The major setback to this study is the non-availability of data to cover a wide range of Asian and Pacific countries.
