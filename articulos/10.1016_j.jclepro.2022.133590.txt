                  Congruent with economic stability and environmental sustainability, the ninth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG - Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) plays a crucial role in undergirding the industrial revolution. Conversely, it is inevitably complex for underdeveloped and emerging economies to meet the ninth SDG's 2030 agenda due to a lack of sufficient financial resources and the slow adoption of technology. With China expanding its Belt and Road Initiatives (BRIs) globally, mainly few findings espouse the significant link between BRI and the ninth SDG, and its probable impact remains understudied. Hence, a considerable gap yet exists in contemporary understanding of the impact of BRI on sustainability. Therefore, we conducted an exploratory study on six different countries (Algeria, Ghana, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria and Palestine) to investigate the role of the BRI in achieving the ninth SDG. Face-to-face interviews and focus group discussions were applied. This qualitative data collection technique involved 26 participants representing industry experts and academic researchers. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, translated and thematically analysed. The result showed a significant progressive impact of BRI on the ninth SDG, and that the development of sustainable infrastructure is a key antecedent of the BRI policy enforcement in the six countries explored. The result also showed positive and negative spillover effects of BRI projects in the six countries. Government and Policymakers should design and enforce pro-growth and sustainable strategies to facilitate continuous implementation of policies that would align the execution of the BRI projects to bolster achievement of the ninth SDG.

Congruent with such a progressive agenda, the world's population has grown tremendously and is projected to reach 8 billion people in 2025, 9 billion in 2037 and 10 billion in 2055. The effort to halve the world's poverty ratio has been on the agenda since the first millennium. Of course, world leaders are not idle, although the task is complex (World Health Organization, 2020 ; United Nations, 2019 ). While some obstacles seem insurmountable, institutions such as the United Nations (UN) and the World Health Organization (WHO) remain determined and committed to ending poverty and hunger. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), an effective strategy for a global mobilisation plan, are well structured to set important social priorities to improve people's living standards. The MDGs set the tone to guide global development initiatives from 2015 to 2030 through poverty eradication. These priorities strategically reflect all seventeen SDGs, which ultimately seeks to ensure that everyone have a basic standard of living regardless of their demographic location (United Nations, 2019 ; World Health Organization, 2020 ). The 9th SDG emphasises the need to “build a sustainable industry, innovation and infrastructure to support economic growth.” Adequate infrastructure enables the creation of industry and innovation to sustain it (Ogbeibu et al., 2021a ). This is crucial in achieving sufficient and inclusive growth, leading to better living standards (United Nations, 2019 ). Unlike the developed economies that have successfully built a sustainable economic environment and the developing nations whose potentials, however, systematically face financial obstacles, the emerging nations yet face the most challenging test to advance the successful sustainable economy agenda around the globe (Wackernagel et al., 2017 ; Ogbeibu et al., 2021b ). The unique pattern of economic development in developed countries has always been the foundation for progressive economic growth and sustainability among the world's developing countries (Zeng et al., 2022 ; United Nations, 2019 ). Industrial revolution 4.0 has been instrumental in sustaining the economic growth of powerful nations while accelerating economic growth and sustainability in poor and developing countries, especially in the Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia region (Musibau, 2019 ). This does not overlook various economic indicators integrated into relevant policies to advance the development agenda. Among other important factors for sustainable economic development, adequate infrastructure that is more likely to facilitate extensive research and development that leads to innovation is a critical element in improving the socio-economic well-being of the people (Benintendi et al., 2020 ; Anarfo et al., 2019 ; Zeng et al., 2022 ). Yet, several developing countries struggle with adequate infrastructure resources to achieve the 9th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). Despite ample evidence of progressive infrastructure development, many developing countries struggle with a lack of financial support from external donors and corruption that shakes the foundation of development (World Bank, 2018 ; Anarfo et al., 2019 ). As the world's population continues to grow, infrastructure development becomes even more critical. Most developing countries, especially in Asia and Africa, are experiencing rapid population growth and high demand for basic infrastructures such as stable electricity, efficient transportation system, portable drinking water, and good information technology (IT - UNISA, 2018 ). Unfortunately, most developing countries face financial difficulties in funding critical infrastructure projects to improve the lives of their citizens. Given the complex situation of several emerging and underdeveloped economies, overdependence on foreign aid, especially from China, is real and is becoming an essential issue in terms of borrowing levels (World Bank, 2018 ). For example, a report from previous data shows that Sub-Saharan African countries have a low infrastructure development index in transport, ICT, energy, water and sanitation compared to other developing regions (see Table 1  ), in the face of a noticeable deficit in public infrastructure. According to the United Nations report (2019), the rising electricity consumption, housing deficit and inadequate ICT resources in most developing regions result from rapid population growth. This phenomenon will likely exacerbate the infrastructure crisis by 2035 unless there is radical infrastructure development. Under the United Nations SDGs agenda, each nation is responsible for monitoring and tracking the achievement of the MDGs. In 2016, China positioned itself as one of the significant global proponents of the MDGs by producing a proposal for various countries to achieve the 2030 SDGs, and detailing strategies to implement the agenda (United Nation, 2019 ). This initiative came after the launch of the intercontinental mega infrastructure project, also known as the Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI), which aims to promote rapid regional infrastructure development to achieve the 9th Five Year Plan. In line with such a global framework for infrastructure development. There are several concerns about the progress of BRI in more than 65 developing countries in line with the fulfilment of the 9th SDG, which focuses on key economic sectors such as energy, information and communication technology (ICT), transport, etc. (Feng et al., 2019 ; Yanqiang et al., 2018 ). Critical questions raised by experts include;• What is the impact of BRI influence on SDG for industrial growth?  • Is BRI a facilitator or a threat to sustainable infrastructure development?  • How can the BRI generate a spillover effect in developing countries?    Even though the BRI has excellent potential to contribute to the SDGs, it remains uncertain how the BRI initiatives impact the 9th SDG across several emerging economies. There is therefore, a need to further engage in thorough exploratory investigations to comprehend the role of BRI on the 9th SDG. 1.1 Belt and road Initiative's infrastructure development China's central foundation of bilateral cooperation is the creation of the Transcontinental Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013 to connect Chinese economic influence with all six economic corridors (UNISA, 2018 ). This momentous initiative, marking Chinese economic power, is estimated to invest more than $1 trillion over the BRI lifecycle and aims to make substantial infrastructure investments in Africa and Asia (Thurer et al., 2020). Studies (Thurer et al., 2020; Benintendi et al., 2020 ; UNISA, 2018 ) have shown that 140 countries across the globe are involved in the BRI. These countries consists of 40 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, 34 countries in Europe and Central Asia (including 18 European Union countries), 24 countries in East Asia and the Pacific, 17 countries in the Middle East and North Africa, 19 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, and six countries in Southeast Asia. These countries have trade and investment relations with China related to the BRI. According to the World Bank, the BRI, expected to last 30 years, creates sustainable economic opportunities for poor and developing countries (World Bank, 2018 ). Anarfo et al. (2019)  emphasised that the main objective of the BRI is to ensure that the infrastructure deficit in developing countries is significantly reduced to improve economic growth and achieve the SDGs. According to the World European Investment Bank (2018) , most BRI projects focus on infrastructure projects that directly impact economic performance through enterprise development. Hence, the BRI between China and Algeria has laid the foundation for establishing the most significant logistics corridor in North Africa and further expanded the business network between China and Africa. As part of the main objectives of the BRI, sustainable development remains at the core of the BRI project in all sub-regions of Asia, Africa and Latin America. This is because sustainable infrastructure development plays a critical role in considering the quality and durability of projects to improve economic growth. With integrity at stake, China's BRI around the globe ensures that all development initiatives align with the SDGs (Feng et al., 2019 ; Anarfo et al., 2019 ). Anarfo et al. (2019)  stated that the initiatives contribute immensely towards helping deprived countries with economic issues achieve the 9th SDG. Besides that, it helps to highlight and confront economic matters by providing the necessary resources to build sustainable economic infrastructure in transport, energy, Information, Communication and Technology (ICT), and others. The BRI is expected to help developing countries solve economic challenges affecting business growth due to the lack of standard infrastructure (Hahm and Raihan, 2018 ). Previous studies (Yanqiang et al., 2018 ; Rauf et al., 2018 ; Anarfo et al., 2019 ) have indicated that although there are several doubts on the main intention behind the BRI, which looks into the possible political interferences and exploitation of natural resources of other countries. The overwhelming opportunities created by the BRI cannot be ignored by many Sub-Saharan and South-Asian developing countries that require help to boost their economic activities. For many uninformed citizens, the understanding of the BRI is translated as an investment for economic development without any repayment commitment to fulfil the debt (Mengdi and Wang, 2021 ; Benintendi et al., 2020 ). On the other hand, many informed citizens strongly believe the BRI is a trap for China to gain political influence in affected emerging economies. Despite the BRI's potential economic benefit, one of its several concerns is the possible default on debt. Even though China's commitment toward economic development in the developing world is extensively regarded as a drive towards achieving a balanced economic dispensation from western Banks, it also has the potential to transform into economic desperation for many countries that fault the BRI debt payment (Mengdi and Wang, 2021 ; Thürer et al., 2020 ; Benintendi et al., 2020 ).   2 Methodology 2.1 Research procedure The investigation to understand the role of the BRI in the 9th SDG centres on a qualitative research analysis that includes interviews. This study consists of 26 individual interviews and five focus group discussions (FGDs), each group consisting of five to six participants. The interviewees represent industry stakeholders (CEOs, managers, directors, entrepreneurs, etc.,) and academic researchers whose actions and decisions influence the innovation and infrastructure industry structure from 6 different countries. These countries are Algeria, Ghana, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria and Palestine. The five participants from each of the six countries significantly reflect on the most qualified individuals who possess more than sufficient knowledge and experience about BRI in each selected country. Evidence from recent research (Zhang et al., 2021 ; Hussain et al., 2020 ; Senadjki et al., 2020 ; Han and Webber, 2020 ) emphasised the progressive and influential role of the BRI projects in those developing countries, especially with the potential of building a rapid, sustainable infrastructure development towards achieving the 9th SDG. This study adopted a purposive sampling method to conduct direct recruitment based on the experience and qualification of the respondents. Amid the pandemic, all face-to-face interviews and FGDs were conducted through online platforms such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Google Meet as this synchronous online method of qualitative data collection is supported by prior research (Ogbeibu et al., 2018 )..  2.2 Data collection The recruitment process ensured that the respondents to be selected met the requirements to participate in the interviews. The requirements were the interviewees' qualifications, knowledge, and experience about the role of BRI in promoting and achieving the 9th SDG of “Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure”. In other words, all the selected participants met the requirements relatively well. In addition to prioritising conferences, seminars and workshops as essential platforms for the recruitment process, the researchers conducted a thorough search to contact potential participants through the online portal institutions. All potential participants were informed about the research and asked to share their experiences and knowledge. Of the 38 experts contacted, only 26 responded to the request about their willingness to participate in the research, thus, representing 68% of the 38.  2.3 Interview questions A total of eighteen questions were designed, of which six questions contained demographic information about the participants, including “Name of the company?”, “Position in the company? Gender?” and others. The remaining 12 questions were related to the role of the BRI in the ninth SDG. Of the 12 questions, 6 questions each from BRI environmental impact and BRI infrastructure development (see Table 2  ). To ensure consistency and validity of the questions about the research objectives. The questions were evaluated to ensure their validity and reliability to ensure that the data analysis is consistent. After a series of evaluations under the supervision of 3 other researchers from the same field, the questions were approved. The questions were approved and found sufficient to proceed with the research process. This was after a series of screening and assessment exercises.  2.4 Interviews sessions The interviews were conducted in two separate sessions: individual interviews and FGDs. The first session involved an individual face-to-face interview, and the second comprised the FGDs, where participants were divided into 5–6 focus groups. Each group had engaging discussions based on the research question. Meanwhile, each interviewee was allowed to answer the questions according to their knowledge and experience. Both the individual interviews and FGDs were conducted via Zoom and Google Meet. Each interview lasted less than one hour, and the focus group discussions (FGDs) lasted less than three hours per group. The interviews and FGD sessions were actively recorded for data analysis.   3 Analysis Using the inductive analysis method, all interviewees' responses were analysed thematically (Vaismoradi and Snelgrove, 2019 ). The result (in Table 3  ) shows that 50% of the interviewees were between thirty and fourty years old. 30% were between fourty and fifty years old, and 20% of the interviewees were fifty and above. Moreover, 58% were male, and 42% were female. Regarding profession and experience, 54% were industry players, including CEOs, directors, managers, and entrepreneurs.Meanwhile, 26% of the participants worked as academicians (e.g., professors, lecturers, and researchers) for universities with relevant publication experience, especially in BRI projects. 20% of them were in the category of business consultants for industrial businesses that includes BRI activities. Based on BRI experiences, 81% of the interviewees were directly involved in the BRI projects, either business trade development or infrastructure development. Whereas, just 19% have indirect experience through BRI research activities. Out of the six different countries of investigation (Algeria, Ghana, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria and Palestine), 26 responses were acquired with an average of five participants. Although the number of respondents is limited due to an insufficient research scope under the BRI project, the number of responses is considered significant and directly reflects the outcome of the analysis as undergirded by the works of Gyamerah et al. (2021)  and Butt et al. (2020)  that mirror similar number of respondents. The selected participants have direct research experience and sufficient relevant knowledge of BRI projects in their respective countries. The participation of these countries is based on the history, current and future activities of the BRI, in line with the deep-rooted bilateral relations with China. The BRI projects in these countries can be broadly classified as road infrastructure, mining, energy and transport (see Table 4  ). Most participants shared relevant insights on the direction of BRI in promoting sustainable infrastructure and innovation development in their respective countries. Data from 26 interviews and 5 FGDs were processed, transcribed and transformed into a thematic analysis using the inductive method (Vaismoradi and Snelgrove, 2019 ). Respondents' statements were coded into the category’ Themes and Thematic Sections' using the software ATLAS.ti. The themes include; 1) the impact of the BRI on the sustainable development of industrial infrastructure (see Table 4 ), 2) the effect of BRI on environmental risks (see Table 5  ), and 3) spillover effect of BRI (see Fig. 1  ). Based on the responses, four out of the twelve questions asked produced similar answers (i.e., only two out of the four were relevant); these questions include Q3, Q4, Q10 and Q12. Responses for Q10 and Q12 were concisely excluded to avoid the repetition of answers. Consequently, 10 of the 12 variable questions were applicable and considered meaningful to answer this study's objectives. Hence, from Tables 4–5 , eight questions (Q1 to Q6, Q8 and Q9) were utilised. However, the responses for Q7 and Q11 highlight the “Spillover effect analysis” in the discussion section. Based on the 26 responses from the six countries, 19% of the participants were from Indonesia and Algeria, respectively. 15% each were from Ghana, Algeria, Nigeria and Palestine, respectively. The analysis showed that 50% of the participants' reiterated that BRI projects in Algeria and Palestine create explicit business opportunities through the import and export economic activities in the form of trade openness. 73% of the participants indicated that BRI projects directly contribute to business digitalisation by integrating modern technologies in industrial infrastructure development in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. Interestingly, 57% of participants agreed that most of the BRI projects under the urbanisation agenda significantly promote the expansion of sustainable housing projects. 30% of the participants reiterated that the growing proliferation of BRI projects in Ghana, Algeria etc., promotes the investment in large-scale solar energy generation and biogas, mini-hydro and biomass generation. 53% of the participants emphasised that the development of the BRI projects directly improves Nigeria and Algeria's transportation infrastructure. Transportation infrastructure development in those developing countries focuses on railways, roads, ports, and others (see Table 4 ). Similar studies (Chen and Li, 2021 ; Wang et al., 2020 ; Amighini, 2018 ) also highlight that most BRI projects in Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia emphasise infrastructure development that involves the construction of road networks and bridges, ports, energy plants and many others. Such infrastructure developments under the BRI are executed on the SDGs. This study found significant BRI developments in developing countries (like Algeria, Malaysia, Nigeria, Palestine, Ghana, and Indonesia) and each highlight a steady rise of sustainable infrastructure development in transport, energy, mining, water, and sanitation sectors. The progress of these developments with the SDGs agenda reflects the infrastructure development policies of the receiving nations (Seele et al., 2019 ; Ashraf et al., 2022 ). Some countries prioritise a sustainable development agenda, while others lack adequate sustainable development ambition. The BRIs have benefited more developing countries by creating several opportunities for trade openness. The import and export economic activities resulting from trade openness have significantly elevated the economic contribution of the BRI (Sun et al., 2019 ; Xiao et al., 2018 ; Chaturvedi, 2019 ). Among the six participating countries in this study, it is hard to deny that the BRI has positively influenced several key sectors of the economies as noted in the following interview participant's response. “China will overtake France as Algeria's top exporter of commodities to China, as the two countries' trade has grown recently. Algeria imports US$1.2 billion from China, which exports US$7.9 billion … " (I11, Male, Algeria) (See Table 4  ).  Countries like Algeria and Palestine allow more BRI projects to facilitate the transaction of goods made in China. With the economic prospect of those countries, the intended BRI projects in the future will strengthen the trading partnership between the countries (Yuan et al., 2018 ; Sun et al., 2019 ). Moreover, due to rapid industrialisation, more organisations are gradually digitalising their business activities (Nikulina, 2020 ). Consequentially, such optimistic developmental projection proves the relevance of the BRI projects since most infrastructural developments takes place with relevant technology. For instance, several businesses in Malaysia are accepting digital technology as the new normal, and a part of the BRI projects is influencing the use of digital technology for innovation (through research and training), especially in the railway infrastructure development sector (Jiang and Hui, 2021 ; Sharma and Kundu, 2016 ; Qi et al., 2019 ). A participant argued that “Several BRI projects promote training for local managers, engineers, technicians and operators about new smart technology to improve firm production system” (I8, Male, Malaysia) (See Table 4  ).  Unlike Malaysia, other economies like Singapore and Thailand are nurturing the source of innovation through better integration and technology optimisation through BRI projects (Jiang and Hui, 2021 ). The green urbanisation program, progressing steadily in the form of forest cities in countries like Malaysia, significantly reflects green development measures for BRI projects (Rauf et al., 2020 ). According to Amighini (2018) , the initiatives also exhibit the Chinese government's ambition to promote the sustainable development agenda in other BRI projects. This study revealed some conclusions on the ‘green development agenda’ as “Major Chinese investments and construction contracts in peninsular Malaysia include multiple airports, ports, expressway, forest city and the Malaysia-China Kuantan Industrial Park … " (I10, Male, Malaysia) (See Table 4  ).  Although there is still doubt about how far the BRI projects can go as far as green environmental development is concerned, the emphasis on green development projects in some areas in Southeast Asia is near reality (Muhammad et al., 2020 ; Wei et al., 2021 ). This study reveals that with the introduction of BRI, policies encourage investment in large-scale renewable energy generation in biogas, solar, hydro and biomass. The BRI projects in the renewable energy sector are exponentially increasing due to the high demand for renewable energy (Kumar 2007 ). A participant also stated that "Algeria's government and China BRI projects are looking to expand solar energy production making the energy sector as one of the major sectors …." (I11 Male, Algeria) (See Table 4  ).  Renewable energy development is crucial to building a sustainable environment and economy (Zeng et al., 2020 ; Kumar 2007 ). In Indonesia, some BRI projects emphasise the effort to generate hydroelectricity and eventually promote the sustainable development agenda (Feng et al., 2019 ; Jiang et al., 2021 ). The awareness to explore renewable energy sources such as solar, water and wind is rapidly forming the key foundation to building sustainable renewable energy (Arminen and Menegaki, 2019 ). This study reveals that over 75% of the BRI, including roads, ports, and railways, account for transport infrastructure projects. The project entails the development of basic infrastructure facilities that the country does not have (Garlick, 2017 ). According to Table 4 , a participant emphasised that, “Infrastructure project such rail route, gas line, properties, and new town. It covers the whole country.” “There are few mega projects involved BRI in Malaysia. Highways and railways are the two main projects involved” (FGD1, P5) (See Table 4  ) . Although the projects cover transport infrastructure development, it also entails several diverse economic development sectors (Menhas et al., 2019 ). The result (see Table 5 ) shows that 30% of the total responses emphasised that some BRI projects could be associated with environmental risks such as industrial pollution without adequate ecological policy and regulation. However, with an acceptable environmental policy, such risk can be adequately mitigated. Again, 15% of the total responses affirmed that the extraction of mineral materials to undertake the projects is excessive and requires regulatory policy enforcement at the execution of BRI projects. Therefore, more emphasis should be directed to protecting the resources from depletion in developing economies like Ghana. 23% of the participants believe that although the building of infrastructure would require the clearing of lands for development, the execution of some BRI projects still struggles with the issue of deforestation depending on the country's environmental policy. Recent debates (Zeng and Wang, 2022 ; Zhao et al., 2021 ; Ahmad et al., 2018 ) similarly emphasised the ecological impact of BRI projects and the need to enhance environmental policies to promote more sustainable infrastructure development in developing countries. This study found few environmental risks of BRI projects in lower-middle-income countries like Ghana, Nigeria, and others. Unlike the upper-middle-income countries, BRI projects are guided by resilient infrastructure development and environmental policies. Lower-middle income and poor nations struggle to deal with the negative impact of BRI projects due to either lack of rugged environmental protection policies or the inability to enforce existing policies (Cai et al., 2018 ; Ahmad et al., 2018 ). To industrial pollution, several countries worldwide, especially developing countries in Asia, Latin America and Africa, are struggling with waste management. All participating countries in this study have highlighted similar struggles as captured in the following participants' statements. “Environmental issues like air pollution affect air quality. The BRI projects will produce more sulphur oxide and chlorofluorocarbon emissions” (I6 Female, Indonesia). “As a result of habitat fragmentation and degradation caused by the BRI, biodiversity may be lost, and greenhouse gas emissions may rise as a result of the construction and maintenance of transportation infrastructure” (FGD1, P4) (see Table 5  ).  The damaging effect of environmental risks on human health is deadly. People suffer from all kinds of health issues, such as skin and respiratory diseases, lung cancer etc., from excessive carbon emission (Zeng and Wang, 2022 ; Lee et al., 2021 ; World Health Organization, 2020 ). The outcome of the BRI projects is significant for economic growth and development. However, the continued development without proper environmental protection measures will soon lead to devastating consequences (Yuan et al., 2018 ; Wan et al., 2019 ). Depleting natural resources to expand development is a long-term struggle for many resource-rich countries (Zhao et al., 2021 ). Countries such as Algeria, rich in oil and gas, Ghana in Gold and bauxite, and Nigeria in oil, gas and labour, have all shown to have lapses when dealing with activities like mining. With such an inevitable struggle, more than 70% of the world's natural resources are currently being exploited and depleted in the quest for power domination (Zhao et al., 2021 ; Sarker et al., 2018 ). This study found that a country like Ghana is currently battling with resource depletion where the government continue approving loan agreement to expand Chinese road infrastructure development in return for bauxite extraction. A participant argued that “Majority of BRI projects in the mining sectors in Ghana focus on resources extractions without any effort to protect the natural forest …." (I9, Male, Ghana) (See Table 5  ).  However, many citizens believe Ghana's-Chinese infrastructure development initiatives are a progressive step towards economic development. A large number of the Ghanian citizens have lost faith in the effort to protect the land and resources for the next generation (Venkateswaran, 2020 ). Mass deforestation activities to enable the BRI projects to commerce without adequate measures to protect the ecosystem is troubling, and need urgent environmental actions from the global regulatory bodies. Most importantly, it controls climate change effects (GSIA, 2019 ; Anwar et al., 2021 ; Yang et al., 2019 ). Based on discussions from the focused groups, there is currently little or no effort to protect the forestry and ecosystem. Due to that, the world is struggling with climate change effects like flooding, high weather temperature and others. Participants espoused that “BRI projects involve deforestation, and the risk of deforestation through the establishment of forest cities will pose serious short-term environmental risks …. In some way, the BRI projects in road, ports, rail infrastructure development lead to climate change since ecosystems have been destroyed” (FGD3, P4) (see Table 5  ).  Even though all BRI projects are meant to comply with sustainable development initiatives, there are still lapses in developing environmental protection policies and law enforcement (EIB 2018; Lee et al., 2021 ).  4 Discussions & conclusion This study finds positive and negative spillover effects of BRI projects in countries like Indonesia, Nigeria, Ghana and Algeria. Based on Q7 and Q11 (see Table 2 ), the responses indicate positive spillover effects, including infrastructure expansion, job creation, foreign direct investment (FDI), and knowledge transfer and technology (see Fig. 1 ). 1) The spillover effect of infrastructure expansion covers the construction of bridges, roads, dams, airports and ports in various developing sectors of the economy (Wang et al., 2020 ; Ashraf et al., 2022 ; Hahm and Raihan, 2018 ). 2) The spillover effect of job creation extends to job opportunities created through construction activities. During such activities, the labour opportunities for people are significant (Chen et al., 2021 ; Liao et al., 2021 ). In addition, the training activities in the BRI projects also present a significant spillover effect because ordinary people are trained and equipped with the necessary skills for road and rail infrastructure projects (Chen and Li, 2021 ; Chong et al., 2019 ). 3) The spillover effect of foreign direct investment (FDI) represents the establishment of enterprises to promote the expansion of small and medium businesses and create healthy firm competitiveness. 4) The spillover effect of the transfer of knowledge and technology presents more significant establishments of R&D to promote innovation. The development of innovation allows rapid application and integration of necessary technology for economic growth (Rauf et al., 2018 ; Anarfo et al., 2019 ; Feng et al., 2019 ). However, the study also presents factors including environmental waste (solid waste), environmental pollution (liquid and Carbon emissions), sovereignty threat and financial debt trap as the negative spillover effects (see Fig. 1 ). 1) The spillover effect of environmental pollution highlights the contamination of water bodies, including rivers, streams, ponds, etc., with industrial chemicals resulting from mining activities (Huang, 2019 ; Sarker et al., 2018 ; Zeng and Wang, 2022 ). Other effects also outline the excessive carbon emissions from industrial activities initiated through the “B&R Initiative”. 2) The effects of environmental waste also cover the generation of solid wastes as a result of improper or mismanagement of industrial wastes such as garbage, plastics and others (Zhao et al., 2021 ). 3) Although it is believed to be an assumption, the possible effect of political influence by the Chinese on BRI countries is gradually becoming inevitable, especially in countries with heavy financial debt or default. The certainty is the influence of BRI on political affiliation with some developing countries (De Soyres et al., 2020 ; Ashraf et al., 2022 ). The positive spillover effects represent the significantly positive impact B&R initiative projects have on the economy and adequate enforcement of developmental policies to ensure the proper execution of infrastructure development (Zhao et al., 2021 ). On the other hand, the negative spillover effects reflect inadequate formulation and enforcement of infrastructure policies to ensure suitable BRI measures. Extant research findings (Yu et al., 2013 ; Xueliang, 2013 ) have highlighted the possible BRI spillover effect, supported by many in-depth discussions. The vast majority of the discussions relay that there is more positive spillover than negative spillover of the BRI on economic performance. Conversely, the results of other studies (Wang et al., 2020 ; Qi et al., 2019 ; Huang, 2019 ; Sarker et al., 2018 ) strongly challenge such claims, and further debate that BRI countries that fail to form policies needed to execute projects following reasonable development goals (SDG) are born to struggle with more negative spillover effects soon. The interview responses primarily contend for the existence of direct enforcement of sustainable infrastructure development under the BRI, despite the political struggle leading to some environmental risks. The findings discovered that most BRI projects in the six countries explored, show a steady increase in sustainable infrastructure developments in the transport, energy, and housing sectors. The progress of these sustainable developments is reflected in projects involving rail, road and port infrastructure, digitalisation of industries, green urbanisation and renewable energy. Conversely, the BRI resonates with environmental problems in the form of industrial pollution, resource depletion and massive deforestation in these countries, due to a lack of innovation and inadequate policies. Moreover, the spillover effects of BRI projects show both positive and negative impacts on the economy. The prioritisation of BRI toward sustainable infrastructure development coincides with the 9th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). But BRI sustainable development practices are adequately implemented in Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, while poorly implemented in Nigeria, Palestine and Ghana. Interestingly, the approval of the designation plan is highly dependent on the infrastructure development policy of the host country. Although BRI infrastructure development is instrumental in building an advanced economy, seeking a balance between environmental protection and development is critical to achieving the goal of sustainable development in industrial and infrastructure development.  5 Policy recommendation Based on the findings, the proposed policy recommendations are necessary to achieve sustainable infrastructure development in BRI countries. Despite speculation about China's ulterior motives in the BRI project. Our results show that China's BRI highlights several initiatives for sustainable infrastructure development in BRI countries. This implies that the BRI projects have experienced sustainable infrastructure development, especially in South Asian countries like Singapore and Malaysia. However, in developing countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Indonesia, a more pragmatic approach to enforcing sustainable developments is yet to be fully implemented due to infrastructure innovation challenges. Therefore, we recommend countries participating in BRI design or redesign policy-ideological statutes to comply with sustainable infrastructure development and industrial activities and involve all community stakeholders, and focus on strict enforcement of compliance (Chen and Li, 2021 ). Often, leaders fall prey to corruption to put their selfish interests above national duties. Therefore, political leaders and local authorities should be held accountable for any lapse in enforcing environmental and sustainability policies (Jiang et al., 2021 ). In addition, governments and other stakeholders should rely on the China BRI and prioritise research and development in local universities to expand innovation and technology development to enable effective, sustainable infrastructure development from the grassroots (Khan et al., 2021 ). In line with sustainable infrastructure development, policies should be implemented to enforce the replanting of destroyed trees for construction activities to preserve the ecosystem. Governments of BRI countries should ensure that all infrastructure developments under BRI projects serve the people and protect the ecosystem for green economic growth (Arminen and Menegaki, 2019 ).  6 Limitation The interviews were conducted via zoom, and Microsoft experienced an unstable internet connection. Due to poor connections, few of the interview sessions were disrupted and ended abruptly. However, the affected interviews were rescheduled to avoid unstable connections. During the translation and coding process, the context of the data is likely to lose its originality. However, the subsequent coding steps allowed for successful translation and coding of the data. This process ensured the minimal loss of original data. In addition, the recruitment process was challenging due to the busy schedules of some of our potential participants. Therefore, finding a suitable date and time for the interviews was challenging. Initially, almost all the interviewees (lecturers, researchers, CEOs, managers, directors, etc.,) were not available at the originally scheduled date and time of the interview, while others did not show interest. Therefore, we had to reschedule an interview date and time that suited the respondents. Again, most interviewees were less willing to speak publicly about government projects such as the BRI projects due to fear of retaliation for speaking out against the government projects. Therefore, to ensure and protect the identity of all respondents, a secure zoom link and Microsoft account were set up to allow them to freely express their views on the impact of the BRI on sustainable development.
