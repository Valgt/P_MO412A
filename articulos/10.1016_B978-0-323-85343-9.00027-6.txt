Keywords Biochar  soil health  sustainable development goals  soil management   2.1 Introduction  Over the past years, the sustainable development goals (SDGs) become an attractive topic for sustainable development and international collaboration over the globe. The United Nations put forward 17 SDGs as the blueprint to build a greener and more sustainable future for the whole world. These SDGs aim to address various global challenges such as poverty, climate change, and environmental remediation (UN, 2015 ). In particular, soil health becomes a vital element among several SDGs, including SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), SDG 13 (climate action), and SDG 15 (life on land). The biochar soil application associated with SDGs can be illustrated in Fig. 2.1  . Soil constitutes a significant section of the ecosystem and serves as a fundamental support for crop growth, thus acting as a determining factor for productivity and human well-being. Soil biodiversity closely affects crop diseases and assures the ordered working of ecosystem. The health of soil environment is not only the significant factor for eliminating poverty and hunger but also a critical condition to ensure water quality and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Hou et al., 2020a ). It is encouraged to develop cutting-edge technologies to pursue a sustainable development with carbon-efficient manner and reach the United Nation’s SDGs. Soil management with secure land use and efficient food production is a critical factor to achieve the above goals. It is commonly known that the accumulated potentially toxic elements from geogenic and anthropogenic sources into agricultural soils are threatening global food safety and security. The major contaminants in soil include toxic elements such as cadmium, mercury, copper, zinc, and lead, and organic pollutants, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and pesticides. In recent years, microplastics are emerging as the contaminants in the soil environment and are drawing more and more attention (He et al., 2021 ). Therefore innovative technologies are being encouraged to search for effective and efficient ways for soil remediation; nature-based solution (NBS) is defined to exploit nature-based, economical, and environmentally friendly treatment technologies while redeveloping strategies that are socially inclusive and economically viable (Song et al., 2019 ). This novel concept expects growing research studies to better understand the benefits and enhance its practicality to achieve SDGs. Therefore exploration of proper materials and techniques is essential to assure the sustainable use and management of soil resource and achieve SDGs.  2.2 Biochar material 2.2.1 Production of biochar In the last few decades, a biomass waste–derived carbonaceous material, known as biochar, is gradually attracting much attention as an economical alternative to remove potentially toxic elements from soil via absorption, complexation, electronic attraction, etc. (Zhou et al., 2017; Mohanty et al., 2018; Rajapaksha et al., 2018 ). Biomass is abundant on the earth and forms much faster than fossil fuel, which is regarded as a promising resource for renewable energy and material production. Biochar material dated back to the discovery of Terra Preta de indio (black carbon/earth) from the Amazon basin in the early 20th century, which was found to significantly improve crop growth compared with other topical soils. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, it was estimated that approximately 140 billion metric tons of  biomass waste is generated globally from agriculture each year. Biomass-derived biochar has been extensively demonstrated to immobilize soil contaminants in numerous research studies (Fang et al., 2016; Yoo et al., 2018 ). In addition, research advances are emerging on biochar modification and synthesis of functional carbon composites from pristine biochar (Xiong et al., 2017 ), which provide great scientific insights for fabrication of renewable and novel environmental materials for soil fertility improvement, soil remediation, and other clean productions. Biochar can be conventionally produced via biomass pyrolysis under limited oxygen environment at the temperature primarily ranging from 300 to 800°C (Xiong et al., 2017 ). Pyrolysis includes fast and slow pyrolysis according to the operating parameters. Conventional carbonization, known as slow pyrolysis, generates biochar as the major product in solid phase while producing a small amount of syngas as well as condensed bio-oil in gaseous and liquid phases, respectively. This process usually requires a relatively low heating rate (5–7°C/min) with long residence time (>1 h) (Liu et al., 2015 ). Comparatively, fast pyrolysis at the heating rate higher than 200°C/min and the residence time within 10 s tends to favor the generation of bio-oil (Qian et al., 2015 ). Besides, gasification is a partial combustion process. It is conducted at high temperature range (600–1200°C) and could produce biochar as the coproduct in solid phase as well as syngas (H2 , CO, and CO2 ) as the main product in gaseous phase, with the presence of oxidizing agents such as oxygen and steam. The coproducts along with the biochar thermochemical production process, that is, bio-oil and syngas, can be utilized as fuel oils for electricity generation and platform chemicals due to the presence of phenol and phenol derivatives at high contents (Quan et al., 2010 ). In recent years, hydrothermal carbonization of biomass emerges as a novel approach for the production of hydrochar as the biochar analog at relevantly milder conditions (temperature 180–250°C under pressure in water) compared with conventional approaches, which eliminates the redundant step of energy-intensive drying of feedstock biomass (Libra et al., 2011 ).   2.2.2 Biochar properties Biochar is a renewable and sustainable carbonaceous material derived from biomass waste, including lignocellulosic residues such as food waste and forestry residues, as well as nonlignocellulosic residues like dairy manure and organic proportion of municipal solid waste. Lignocellulosic biomass is typically composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, the components of which are highly dependent on the properties of biomass feedstock. For example, biochars derived from manure feedstocks tend to present less carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen contents than lignocellulosic-derived biochars. The economical feedstock and synthesis method bring about various advantageous properties, including large specific surface area, developed pore structure, enriched surface functional groups, and long-term stability. The physicochemical properties of biochar, for example, surface functional groups, surface area, porous structure, and metal dispersion, can be further tailored for improving the function of biochar materials for a diverse range of environmental applications (Xiong et al., 2017 ). In recent years, biochar application has been broadened and covered numerous cutting-edge frontiers such as energy and health-care industry, in terms of biochar’s economical synthesis, sustainable benefits, and tunable characteristics (Ok et al., 2015 ). Biochar mainly contains carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in high contents and several other elements in low contents, including nitrogen, sulfur, phosphors, potassium, sodium, magnesium, aluminum, iron, calcium, and Si, depending on the feedstock type as well as pyrolysis conditions (Bolan et al., 2021 ). The presence of oxygen-containing functional groups on biochar surface assures its potential for functionalization, and it can be also altered by varying pyrolysis conditions, such as temperature, residence time, and purging gas. The zeta potential and the zero point charge could indicate the surface charge of biochar particle. The identification and quantification of biochar proximate, ultimate, physicochemical, surface, and structural properties are critical to evaluate optimal performances for soil management. These characteristics of biochar, including pH, bulk density, electrical conductivity, and elemental composition, can be quantified via traditional techniques. Advanced analytical instruments can quantify chemical elements and quantity aromatic compounds within the bulk matrix of biochar (Bolan et al., 2021 ).  2.2.3 Biochar modification and functionalization Synthesis of engineered biochar composites with porous structure as well as developed functionalities has facilitated a diverse range of environmental applications. The modified biochars with increased surface area and enriched functional groups are able to serve as cost-effective and renewable catalysts and/or catalyst supports for chemical and physical transformations, including adsorption and degradation of environmental contaminants. For example, emerging applications of biochar as catalysts or catalyst supports for environmental remediation (e.g., advanced oxidation processes) and green biorefineries have been explored extensively in the last few decades (Kumar et al., 2020a ). Biochar activation can be realized by forming and developing newly formed internal porous structure or functional groups during activation, including physical and chemical activations (Kumar, et al., 2020a ). Physical activation is usually achieved by thermal activation using CO2  or steam at high temperatures (800–900°C). Comparatively, chemical activation of biochars can be achieved by means of acidic solution or hydroxides, where biochar is typically mixed and stirred with activation agents such as KOH, K2 CO3 , and KHCO3  (Sevilla et al., 2016 ). Chemical activation is able to enhance biochar porous structure by releasing tar particles from micropores. It is effective to enlarge the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface, for example, aim to facilitate highly efficient magnetic impregnation. Various biochar surface modification methodologies (such as impregnation methods for biochar-based composites) have been developed by scientists to cater to diverse environmental applications. By means of functionalization of pristine biochar, the biochar composites can be synthesized and present superior performances. Typical biochar composites include (1) metal–biochar composites, (2) mineral–biochar composites, (3) layered double hydroxide–biochar composites, (4) carbonaceous engineering nanocomposites, and (5) microorganism–biochar composites (Wang et al., 2021 ). For example, iron–biochar composites, such as nano-zero valent iron–biochar, iron oxide–biochar, and iron sulfide–biochar composite, are favorable for the adsorption and immobilization of trace elements as well as organic contaminants via enhanced precipitation, complexation, and electrostatic interactions (Alam et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021 ). Magnetic modification could improve diverse biochar characteristics as well as increase metal-sorption efficiency of biochar. In general, such magnetically modified biochars are ferromagnetic, which render facile recovery from contaminated solutions by means of filtration process via a magnet (Zhou et al., 2014 ). Therefore this method is highly favorable to efficiently recycle contaminant-laden magnetic biochar adsorbents after their application of environmental remediation.    2.3 Sustainable soil management by biochar 2.3.1 Soil quality improvement Biochar is a critical by-product from thermochemical conversion of waste biomass residues and brings about numerous environmental benefits for soil improvement (Sohi et al., 2010 ). Biochar addition can improve soil chemical properties such as cation-exchange capacity, nutrient retention, adjusting soil pH, and increasing soil water content, as well as soil physical properties such as pore size distribution, bulk texture, structure, and soil density. Sustainable agriculture aims to grow crops in a socially, environmentally, and economically beneficial manner, which could be sustained in the long term. Application of biochar amendment in agricultural soil can enrich the soil sustainability. Moreover, biochar addition into the agricultural soil can result in the increase of crop yields over several cropping cycles in different soil types (Awad et al., 2018 ). Due to the above favorable properties, biochar compost is extensively be applied as soil amendment to tailor soil physicochemical properties and mediate soil microbial community, thus enhancing soil health and crop yield. Biochar as compost could greatly contribute to nutrient retention in soil. Biochar can serve as a reservoir of macro- and micronutrients and accelerate nutrient cycling processes in the long term (Deluca et al., 2015 ). The mineral-rich biochar can be applied as a slow-release fertilizer and provide nutrient supply to the soil. During the biomass pyrolysis at high temperatures, the carbon content is gradually lost, remaining a high proportion of thermally stable nutrients on the material. Natural minerals present in the biochar can promote soil fertility and increase crop yield. For example, the nutrient-rich biochar composites can be synthesized and applied as slow-release fertilizers, improving crop productivity and reaching for SDG 2 – zero hunger (Wang et al., 2021 ). Biochar-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) is able to provide extra bioavailable DOM, thus promoting the plant growth in regards of yield and quality. Besides, it was reported that bioavailable DOM released from biochar can be a major carbon source for soil microbial community, thus promoting microorganism activities and microbial respiration and influencing compositions of soil carbon (Sun et al., 2021 ). Biochar application into soil can significantly contribute to crop productivity, as the stable carbon source from biochar can increase the soil cation-exchange capacity, leading to the retention of numerous micro- and macronutrients. The macropores of biochar particles can also benefit the soil water infiltration, water holding capacity, as well as soil aeration. Biochar addition also has a positive effect on the soil biological properties, thus improving soil fertility (Sherene, 2017 ). The enzymatic activity that is surrounding the plant rhizosphere plays a crucial role on the bioavailability of the nutrients to the crop. Biochar with enriched pore structure could offer a proper habitat for soil microorganisms and boost soil microbial activity, improving microbial biomass, activity, and growth rates, as well as adjusting the composition of the microbial communities (Fischer and Glaser, 2012 ). It was reported that the toxicity and bioavailability of soil contaminants to microbes could be reduced due to the biochar-mediated immobilization of trace elements as well as other organic contaminants (Zhu et al., 2017 ). Therefore the soil enzyme activity enhances the decomposition of organic matter as well as nutrient cycling.  2.3.2 Contaminants immobilization In recent decades, researchers have been extensively developing numerous remediation technologies to eliminate or mitigate soil contamination. Bioremediation and phytoremediation are practical examples of soil management; however, the field effectiveness of bioremediation suffers from inconsistency, which is probably due to heterogeneity of soil conditions in the soil as well as the artifacts resulted from assessing treatments on a spot-by-spot basis instead of applying field-wide evaluation (Hou et al., 2020b ). The emerging application of cost-efficient and renewable carbonaceous materials has shown great environmental benefits. For instance, stabilization agents like biochar could achieve in situ stabilization of agricultural soil (Hou et al., 2018 ). Biochar application in soil can achieve the immobilization of various potentially toxic elements and organic contaminants for healthy crop production. Soil pollution comes from a diverse range of sources, including geogenic and anthropogenic processes. Domestic, industrial, and agricultural activities can be the possible means of transportation of contaminants into the soil, for example, atmospheric deposition, transportation, and usage of impure mineral fertilizers or manures (Hou et al., 2020b ). Besides, it was reported that geogenic source from natural geological processes can also be a critical cause of heavy metal(oid) contamination. For instance, some heavy metal(loid)s originating from the soil parent material (such as Cr and Mn) and natural minerals (e.g., Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn) might transform and exist in the agricultural soil (Hou et al., 2020b ). Various metal(loid)s (e.g., selenium, chromium, mercury, arsenic, lead, and cadmium) that are widely existing in different industries would pose a significant threat to solid waste management,  regarding to their acute and chronic risks to the environment and ecosystems (Song and Li, 2014 ). In addition, radioactive elements generated from nuclear applications are also of highly risk and suggested to be also cautiously treated to prevent leaching and subsequent threats to the soil environment (Xiong et al., 2019 ). The efficiency of immobilizing different potentially toxic elements and organic contaminants varies from different biochar materials. It is found that biochars with well-developed structures (such as high BET surface) tend to be less effective for absorbing metal pollutants (e.g., Cd, Cu, Pb), while they would be more active for removing organic pollutants (e.g., phenol), compared with poorly developed structures (Han et al., 2013 ). Biochars with high surface area possess more sufficient space and are more favorable for post modifications such as metal impregnations, thus producing more sorbents both for removing organic and inorganic contaminants from soil ecosystem (Trakal et al., 2019 ). Nevertheless, the long-term effect of biochar amendment that leads to unintended effects on the soil and ecosystem requires further investigations. For example, it was reported that biochar amendment can result in the time-dependent release of soil contaminants, including potentially toxic elements, persistent free radicals, benzene, phenols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and carboxylic acids. Biochar aging process also affects the performance of biochar soil application, due to the variation of biochar physicochemical characteristics like oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface and specific surface area (He et al., 2021 ). It should be noted that biochars cannot always lead to desired outcomes, due to the complicated interaction between biochar and soil as well as the distinguish properties of inherent contaminants in biochar. It was reported in the previous literature that organic pollutants (e.g., volatile organic carbons and dioxins), poetically toxic elements, and some nanoparticles could be formed along with the production of biochar, depending on the feedstock and pyrolysis parameters. These compositions would pose severe threat to the plant and microorganism during the soil application of biochar. Research gaps should be investigated further in the future studies to explore the inherent mechanisms and avoid environmental risks, such as bioavailability. It is imperative to improve efficient methods for extracting and detecting those contaminants in biochar. The biological tests with diverse species of organisms should allow for identifying the potential toxicity on microorganisms induced by the contaminants, for example, by means of germination test and earthworm avoidance test. Therefore biochar modification with enhanced long-term stability and time-dependent monitoring the C- and N-cycling of soil is expected to improve the biochar performances in agroecosystems.  2.3.3 Carbon sequestration The production processes generally render biochar with a high surface area in a stable fixed carbon structure and alkaline characteristics, which makes biochar desirable in increasing soil moisture content, sorb soil contaminants, and soil pH (Hou et al., 2020a ). Besides, the formation of biomass is regarded as an approach to capture the carbon from the atmosphere into recalcitrant carbon in the environment. Biochar can adsorb the dissolved organic carbon in soil, reducing the available carbon substrate for CH4  production and mitigating soilborne CH4  emission (Cai et al., 2018 ). Therefore biochar technology is crucial in mitigating GHG emission and relieving climate change (Woolf et al., 2010 ). Evaluations should be made by means of assessment tools. Life cycle assessment is an extensively adopted framework that facilitates the understanding of the environmental performance and to quantify the overall impacts of biochar product and interaction processes in soil. The environmental sustainability of process systems has attracted more attention other than the economic cost as well as technical performance. Soil organic carbon (SOC) represents the level of soil functionality that relates to soil hydraulic properties, soil structure, and microbial activity (Hou et al., 2020a; Vogel et al., 2018 ). SOC is a crucial component of carbon cycle on the globe, playing an active role in the SDG 13: climate action. Soil management might cause great effect on carbon cycling. On the other hand, applications of fertilizer can contribute to soil functionality and greatly enhance SOC levels. Therefore application of soil amendments, such as biochar compost, into agricultural land plays an active role in improving carbon storage and mitigating GHG emissions. For example, it was reported that biochar applications could lead to improved effect on carbon sequestration than other conventional management strategies such as soil amendment application and conservation tillage, due to microbial biomass, and metal oxides–induced immobilization of carbon (Bolan et al., 2013 ). The impact of soil application on climate change can be indicated by SOC and emissions of soilborne GHG such as carbon dioxide and methane. Soil CO2  flux and microbial respiration can be monitored to evaluate the carbon balance in soil after application of biochar fertilizer (He et al., 2021 ). Besides, the cumulative methane emission of soil that releases into the atmosphere in anaerobic conditions is also an essential indicator. Moreover, CO2  adsorption by biochar materials that serve as absorbent has also attracted much attention from the scientific community. The distinguished compositions of biomass waste render the biochar as solid adsorbents with various physicochemical properties applied for capture of carbon dioxide. For example, biochars derived from feedstock  with high carbon content (e.g., coal by-products) is able to capture CO2  at low temperatures ranges (25–75°C), while those with low-carbon content (such as plastic waste) tend to achieve this goal at high temperatures (75–150°C). The sorption process includes both physical and chemical adsorption involving the interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent. The physisorption depends on the van der Waals and electrostatic forces between carbon dioxide molecules and the adsorbent surface. The practical application of biochar absorbents for CO2  capture shows a promising prospect due to the limited cost on the production and operation process. Besides, emerging technologies, known as direct air capture of atmospheric carbon dioxide, have been developed in recent years. This innovative technology aims to control the CO2  concentration and achieve carbon sequestration at the points of emission. Aqueous solvents (e.g., NaOH) are usually employed to dissolve ambient CO2  and form NaCO3  in the process.   2.4 Prospect and future recommendations In the future, more and more NBSs (e.g., green stabilization via sustainable materials) should exploit to explore economic and ecological-friendly approaches for soil management to fulfill the requirements of SDGs. Facile and economic synthesis method of biochar composites is expected. Currently, most synthesis methods require complicated multiple steps that consume extensive energy and chemicals; however, they are not practical for large-scale manufacture. In the future, research studies are recommended to focus on the development of simple synthesis methods with significantly enhanced functionalities and efficiencies, for example, by means of copyrolysis, one-step impregnation in aqueous solution, and ball milling (Kumar et al., 2020b; Shen et al., 2020 ). Ball milling as a pretreatment method could assure a more efficient conversion of lignocellulosic biomass than conventional approaches, which possesses the advantageous properties such as facile operation and solvent-free conditions. Utilization of dilute acid, liquid nitrogen, and microwave can further save the energy consumption of the above process. Exploration of more efficient and nature-inspired doping agents is suggested to improve the efficiency of biochar for soil management. For instance, microorganism doping is proven to improve biochar with enhanced effect on organic contaminant biodegradation (Wang et al., 2021 ). On the other hand, the correlation between thermal conversion of biomass and the subsequent produced biochar should be investigated. The characteristics on the contaminant content and distribution in biochar should be assessed and evaluated in detail before soil application. In particular, the leaching potential of the metal-doped biochars such as magnetic biochar and biochar-based nanocomposite should be paid more attention. Large-scale field demonstrations should be evaluated on the applicability of novel biochar composites other than the experimental tests in the laboratory. In addition to biochar, treatments of biomass residues by means of fractionation, extraction, thermochemical, and biological upgrading are promising ways to generate a diverse range of value-added chemicals, including organic compounds (e.g., succinic acid as pesticide) as well as nutrients (e.g., phosphorous). These bio-derived chemicals as soil additives show large potential in the tremendous market for sustainable agriculture, according to the latest research (Yu et al., 2020 ). An innovative research model on bio-based chemical products for agricultural application in soil as well as smart farming should be promising to boost sustainable soil management and meet SDGs. In terms of soil improvement, it is imperative to improve the monitoring instrumentation to evaluate the trend of microbial dynamics, metal speciation, and fractions, as well as other soil environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, pH, and redox potential) to assure the long-term stability of biochar soil application. For example, numerous artificial aging techniques, including chemical oxidation, mineral modification, and wet−dry cycling, are employed to mimic natural aging mechanisms (Wang et al., 2020a; Wang et al., 2020b ). Moreover, alternative innovative techniques on data analysis like machine learning are also recommended to suggest the engineering design of biochar material and predict the efficiency of biochar amendment in the long term (He et al., 2021 ). For example, more and more countries have adopted green and sustainable remediation procedures, evaluating the environmental impacts as well as social and economic appraisals (Song et al., 2018 ). Policymakers should also address the agricultural land contamination in view of fertilizer and pesticide usage that may impact the livelihood of farmers (Hou and Li, 2017 ). Interdisciplinary studies on information technology as well as environmental science would pose tremendous potential in promoting the capability in sustainable application and utilization of soil resources in the future.  2.5 Conclusion Great efforts on improving soil health should be made to reach the SDGs and realize sustainable agriculture. It is suggested that researchers from wider disciplines, including soil, climate, and material science, should collaborate to achieve the SDGs in a manner more effective. Biochar as a renewable and sustainable material provides an NBS in soil improvement. Enhancement fertility, immobilization of soil contaminants, and carbon sequestration can be achieved by  means of biochar and/or biochar composite materials. Further research studies on facile production and modification of biochar materials to achieve larger-scale application with broader environmental benefits are promising for sustainable agriculture. Interdisciplinary components are expected to make significant contributions to food safety, biodiversity, public health, and climate change mitigation, as well as build efficient strategies to realize the SDGs for our future.
