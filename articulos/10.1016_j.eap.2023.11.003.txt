Environmental degradation is mainly attributable to increased resource use and the subsequent release of greenhouse gases. Various economic and fiscal actions such as the production and consumption of highly carbon-intensive petroleum products, contributed to the worldwide emissions of greenhouse gases in 2018, with CO2 accounting for a little over seventy-five percent of the total (Yu et al., 2023 ). As a result to achieve the targets, nations will need to identify the factors that may contribute to lowering carbon dioxide emissions and lead the way toward a more environmentally friendly world. International cooperation has been needed to combat environmental degradation in emerging economies wealthy in natural resources. Several worldwide conferences, such as the Kyoto Protocol and COP26, have seen nations' commitments to achieving environmentally sustainable development targets by 2050. There was widespread participation from consumers worldwide in the global energy sector, prompting novel energy conservation approaches (Li et al., 2023 ). The reduction of carbon dioxide has a significant impact on the supply and demand patterns because of the greater use of improved renewable energy sources (CUI et al., 2023 ). This is important because it helps to address the trilemma issue. The energy trilemma consists of three related problems: ensuring reliable energy supplies; providing everyone access to affordable, clean energy; and ensuring environmental sustainability. Accelerating the trilemma's resolution is a more rapid improvement in the power flow in each of the three directions. As a result of this transformation, the production and use of energy throughout the globe are undergoing significant shifts. To stay current the Renewable Energy Trilemma Index (ETI) continually looks to revise its methods to incorporate new factors that better capture the ever-changing character of the power market (Li and Umair, 2023 b). Experts are confident that “green productivity” is increased when environmental restrictions are in place. It has been noted for instance, that China's overall green factor productivity has remained the same even though the operation costs at corporate pollution treatment facilities there have increased. (Zhang and Umair, 2023 ) found that in OECD countries, environmental regulations are associated with green output. It has been shown that stricter environmental legislation contributes to an upward trend in green output. It was also shown that ecological constraints improve green output. However, there is evidence that contradicts this assumption. For instance, researchers in China have shown that environmental regulations have a alarming effect on the green effectiveness of companies that manufacture goods. Some studies show that the impact of environmental constraints is non-linear. The researchers found a U-shaped correlation between China's market-incentive ecological regulations and green output. On the other hand a U-shaped correlation was found to be reversed (Liu et al., 2023 ). Green production might benefit from environmental regulations, but this could only be true in nations experiencing rapid economic development. First, environmental regulations might spur manufacturers to design more environmentally friendly products; nevertheless, developing nations may need more funding to support R&D in this area (Li and Umair, 2023 a). Second, the advantages of innovation may only be sufficient to offset the costs imposed by environmental constraints once the idea is applied significantly (Wu et al., 2022 ). Developing nations need help to afford the higher initial investment required for green technologies due to their lower GDP. Third, in the need for complementary support from different technologies, innovative ecological inventory may be used in less developed locations. As an extra precaution, the environmental Kuznets curve was proposed. The correlation between economic growth and contamination was found to take the form of an inverted U. Initially worsening as civilizations grow, environmental quality eventually improves due to more output. If environmental administration is only successful in locations with actual GDP, as has been hypothesized, then the ecological Kuznets curves would support this view. Since China consumes the world's natural resources at an unprecedented rate, it makes for a great study sample. Furthermore, the country's developed financial sector attests to its fast-growing economy (Umair and Dilanchiev, 2022 ). Due to its access to abundant coal, oil, and natural gas, China is an abundant resource country. In addition to being a world leader in producing fossil fuels, China generates a wide variety of additional crucial minerals. For instance, China has made efforts in recent years to ensure constant supplies of minerals used in the electronic components of several sectors, such as the military, relationships, and the production and preservation of electricity from renewable sources. Other essential minerals, such as vanadium and graphite, may be found in large numbers in China. There are vast reserves of rare earth elements in China that are incorporated into advanced technologies (Xiuzhen et al., 2022 ). They found that changes in the electrical sector had an impact on the economy. Their analysis of a wide range of financial sectors (including equities, options, energy output, and traditional treasuries) shows a negative correlation between financial companies, stocks, and consumables. Frequency link and a cross-quantile approach are used to the study of the relationship among sustainable bonds and financial markets. There seems to be a highly restricted association between ecological borrowing expenses and stock markets, even after taking into account differences in the overall stocks, commodities, or oil and gas industry. What's more, it's clear from the data that people are more likely to stay in touch while facing severe economic instability. Adopting investment and company methods that reduce damage to the environment is crucial to achieving this objective. Current efforts to encourage the use of sustainable electricity have not been effective, although evidence indicating the advantages. The United States Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has admitted that there is a lack of money to combat the impact of climate change. Investments of up to a billion USD are therefore required to achieve the 2050 strategic aim, with a yearly base of over $1.8 billion over the last years. Local businesses are mandated by the UN Environment Programme to make a financial contribution to this infrastructure development. To provide more focus on the economic, social, and environmental principles of the SDGs, we collected annual data from time sequence (e.g., from the metrics and stages for SDGs) from 2000 to 2021 at the national and provincial levels. The major goal of this study is to examine China's recent economic expansion and adoption of clean energy sources in the context of economies throughout the world in the wake of Covid-19 and to draw conclusions about how long these trends can be expected to persist. Each country or province's progress toward the SDGs is given a numerical value between 0 and 100. We also discovered evidence of the interconnectedness between SDG goals and of goals with national or regional GDP growth. Comparing the levels of coupling across provinces over the same time period revealed significant variation among provinces with differing levels of development. Finally, we correlated degrees of connection with SDG scores to uncover the most effective pathways for achieving the SDGs in China. Several recent studies have argued in favor of implementing rules that encourage adherence to the Porter theory of innovative green practices via the use of ecologic recovery for carbon neutrality. This innovation relies heavily on green recovery as a means of addressing the green corporate R&D investment gap brought about by the essential risks and unpredictability in green R&D developments. Environmental protection laws are passed by governments to mitigate the effects for ecological deterioration. Obviously, lowering pollution levels is a priority. Governments often provide tax credits and other incentives such as to businesses who engage in green technology R&D. Our study provides progressive contributions to literature and practice in several ways.1) First, by examining the effect on a national basis, this research fills a gap in the existing literature on energy efficiency.  2) Secondly, studies conducted on individual companies predominate in the current research. Most of China's energy is provided by the government and regulated to keep prices down and ensure businesses can access electricity.  3) Thirdly, since authorities have the means and incentive to promote energy efficiency via conservation or enhancement, national research on this topic is crucial.  4) Finally, we differ from previous studies that analyzed economic development and financial development, such as economic growth, by considering the impact of the connection between advancement in financial output and efficient utilization of energy. Finding better methods for managing the global economy without endangering future generations requires focusing on sustained financial and economic growth.    Although our research was comparable to those of others, our emphasis on the world's leading nations in renewable energy allows us to provide more rigorous results of the energy utilization nexus. It's possible to skew findings by including additional governments in the category of “renewable energy-driving countries.” Many countries in China are grappling with how to regulate the growing popularity of renewable energy. Finally, we added the nexus of sustainable development to our earlier work on energy efficiency. The following are taken into consideration throughout the writing of this paper. The literature review is presented in Section 2 , and the research methods used in this study are discussed in Section 3 . Section 4  provides the study's findings and examines them in light of the empirical data used to conduct the research. In Section 5 , we summarized our findings and offered a policy proposal.  2 Literature review Since the inaugural sustainable development summit, the globe still needs to address several pressing issues, such as environmental deterioration and the intense need to keep economic activity running. Green development emerged as a means of reconciling these divisive concerns. Simply put, green growth is the management of economic development and expansion that uses natural resources to benefit society. There is surprisingly little study of sustainable development despite the apparent correlation between it and economic expansion. Given the absence of published material on green growth, we provide a range of research that, at first glance, may seem unrelated to one another (Lacal Arantegui and Jäger-Waldau, 2018 ). Discover that fewer tons of carbon dioxide are released to help preserve the surroundings when economic development increases. The author proposes combining pollutant and eco-efficiency laws to achieve sustainable environmental development. The combined effects of harmful emissions and rising populations both boost economic growth. Therefore, assuming that this impact is about double digits is reasonable. However, the results are minimal since increased trade openness reduces GDP growth even more. Investment in renewable energy and cutting-edge technology is another theory that has been shown to reduce pollution and boost economic development in the host nation (Xu et al., 2020 ). The long-term beneficial correlation between China's economic development and environmental sustainability has also been verified. Policies to reduce carbon dioxide releases have emerged due to this research. These include introducing a carbon pricing system, more public awareness of the problem, and adopting cleaner technology. Similarly, economic development may affect the environment's performance independent of educational attainment. Education plays a key role since it moderates the impact of a country's cultural norms and population density on the nation's environmental sustainability (López Prol and Steininger, 2017 ). However, when productivity and consumption rise, so do the associated environmental costs, such as the greater use of non-renewable resources to meet rising pollution demands. Support this contention by arguing that further economic development below the turning point might lead to increased release of carbon dioxide. However, environmental quality has been reached or improved once growth has passed this threshold (Saheb and Dehghani, n.d. ). Investment and financial development jointly contribute to environmental quality, although the former's influence on public health and educational attainment may need to be more significant to stem the latter. The authors propose strategies to mitigate releases that emphasize energy efficiency, investment in clean technologies, and improving labor standards. Similarly, it verifies that expanding economies are the primary cause of carbon dioxide emissions. The authors advocate for slowing economic development to pay for the import of green technology. Furthermore, economic expansion results may vary from place to place. Evidence from central and western China indicates that carbon dioxide releases rise while economic growth is below a limit level but falls once it reaches that level (Zhang et al., 2020 ). Green growth, as promoted by the “Organization for Economic Cooperation and Growth,” aims to boost the economy while preserving the planet's natural resources so that everyone may reap the rewards. Part of this process is developing a fiscal system with little carbon impact. It might be a source of economic growth that doesn't put issues like climate change or environmental protection at risk. Gross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of all final goods and services produced inside a country in a given time period. As industry and urbanization spread around the globe, so does the threat of natural resource depletion. Unchecked development leads to pollution, rising temperatures, dwindling biodiversity, and depleting supplies. The economy as a whole needs Green Growth (Huang et al., 2022 ) research finds that “green growth strategies” help economies prosper. A natural environment rich in usable resources is optimal for economic growth. Natural resources are held in high regard for their valued contribution to economic progress and prosperity. The influence of changing raw material prices on China's economic growth from 2000 to 2021 was evaluated. More substantial uncertainty in the examined components improves the economy. The fundamental analysis also found a recursive relationship between the parts. The article suggests that the employment of environmentally friendly technology might preserve the planet. According to the findings, this commodity is essential to the growth of China's economy. Endowments of natural resources and economic development cointegrate with the other factors in the research, although the results are contradictory across the time period covered by the study (2000–2020) (Jing and Hou, 2015 ) provide evidence that the price of natural gas is a causal factor in economic growth. To determine the role natural resources have played in China's economic development, we evaluated data from a variety of sources encompassing the years 2000 and 2020. Access to natural resources considerably promotes economic development, as shown by research (Aftab et al., 2022 ) that examined the effect of natural source volatility and green funding on China's financial growth from 2000 to 2018. Find out the two-way relationship between China's resource riches and GDP. Determine the monetary toll that depleting natural resources has on the planet (Yin et al., 2012 ). Influential research looked at how innate capabilities, human capital, and the effectiveness of institutions all contributed to economic expansion. The results suggest boosting the nation's human capital, and institutional finance will speed up its development. In a 2020 paper, (Liu and Bazzi, 2017 ) claim that natural resources may assist in boosting economic growth if strong institutions appropriately handle them. Rising awareness among companies of environmental issues has resulted in sustained interest in innovations in green technologies. As (Vuković et al., 2018 ) point out, manufacturing companies—especially those operating in highly polluting industrial sectors—must carry the burden of environmental protection. Businesses need to consider what their consumers want, their social responsibilities, and the benefits of greening their business activities. Organizations' bottom lines might take some damage due to contamination, which others may interpret as proof of wasteful utilization of resources. Pollution reduction is cited as one way in which technological advances are helping conserve the planet. Solving environmental issues requires green technology. A mutually beneficial strategy, which promotes sustainable growth, helps firms gain and keep an edge via green innovation that benefits both the environment and the bottom line. Employing environmentally friendly procedures improves a company's bottom line and ensures its long-term viability, as stated by (Choi and Jiang, 2009 ). The modernization of the economy and technological advancement are two potential benefits of green technology development. For innovations in environmentally friendly technologies to work, several conditions must be met. First, it must be based on cutting-edge scientific research, and second, it must already exist in some form (either in the form of novel consumer goods or innovative business practices). Many manufacturing facilities have started using process-oriented, eco-friendly techniques. The dual externality dilemma (Kim et al., 2020 ) adds considerable confusion to the process of developing new green technologies. First there is a lag in seeing the potential financial benefits of green technology. Second, various biological reasons are necessary to commercialize green technological developments (Cheema et al., 2020 ). Given the increased interest in creativity failure, especially in polluting industries, it is worthwhile to investigate the factors that affect the financial returns generated by businesses that use environmentally friendly practices. Both green technological innovation and ecological product invention are essential to the green technology method of innovation. To lessen the environmental impact of removal and promote economically viable rehabilitation, “green product innovation” tries to modify or adapt the creation of products through the production process using substances that are not toxic or biological polymers. A “cradle to grave” viewpoint is required to develop, distribute, use, and dispose of imaginative green goods (Pantzalis et al., 2001 ). Enhancing the longevity or recyclability of products is a key aspect of green product imaginative thinking, as is lowering the number of raw materials used, choosing raw resources that are better for the environment, and getting rid of harmful additives. Meanwhile, new green methods attempt to reduce manufacturing's energy needs and recycle by products for reuse (Kerkvliet and Moffett, 1991 ). All components of green technological advancement include reduced air and water carbon dioxide emissions, decreased water consumption, increased resources, sustainability growth in the economy, and a shift from energy sources such as coal to bioenergy. This means that environmentally progressive businesses may obtain and keep an edge in the market (Liu et al., 2021 ). The innovativeness of an organization's produce is directly proportional to the originality of its procedures. An organization's future success depends on its ability to provide environmentally friendly products for various factors. First, the development of green goods depends on green approach technology, which necessitates systematic changes to the whole process of operations to increase the utilization of resources. Research suggests that the expansion situation might help businesses succeed in developing new environmentally friendly products by giving such items an edge in the marketplace. Second, technological advancement helps businesses boost their product standards and introduce new products. To achieve the goal of development that is sustainable, which varies from nation to country, unique approaches must be used. Improving economic performance may be accomplished by studying creative green growth (process and manufacturing), which enables long-term economic growth with a low environmental impact. You argue that fiscal management needs to be geared toward fostering environmentally responsible and resource-efficient growth. We found a unidirectional relationship between environmental development and rising levels of greenhouse gases. The results also highlighted the need to slow economic growth to meet environmental sustainability and sustainability goals (Bhattarai and Hammig, 2001 ). The impact of environmentally friendly modern technology on the financial performance and environmentally friendly practices of Chinese organizations and Korean-owned businesses in the overall economy of China has only been evaluated in a few studies (Sellitto et al., 2020 ). These studies have also yet to establish whether or not green innovation is correlated with financial output. Sustainable progress is aided by innovations in environmental protection that boost productivity in both the economy and the natural world. Economic strategies for fostering ecological expansion were analyzed. Equity and asset values increased for the firms that were examined. Reducing emissions required for economic growth due to technical advances in environmental industries is one example of how environmentally friendly innovations indirectly affect firms' financial success (Guo et al., 2017 ). However, the results reveal that developing countries are behind the industrialized world regarding green growth (Azapagic, 2015 ). The varying effects of ecotourism and environmentally friendly innovations on GDP development in the top 10 countries were evaluated. This research lends credence to the tourism-led development hypothesis in the nations studied by demonstrating the favorable benefits of environmentally friendly technology on economic development and greenhouse gas emissions. Found a correlation between creative thinking and a healthy ecosystem. We examined environmentally friendly technology's impact on sustainable development and how it is employed. The empirical evidence demonstrated a clear link between sustainable technology, green commerce, and sustainable development. The widespread consensus is that green technical innovation aids in green development. Spending more on environmentally friendly finances and new technology has also been shown to improve GDP, which is good for the planet (Sellitto et al., 2020 ).  3 Methodology 3.1 Model 3.1.1 Baseline model Research factors are evaluated by committee investigations, beginning with model assumptions to put environmental and government-subsidized restrictions to the test. The model can explain the first-order lag in technology because it recognizes that green innovation development follows from continuous accumulation. The impact of rising energy costs on environmentally friendly procedures is often nonlinear. The nonlinear factor is included in the model because of the importance of climate control (Sarikaya and Güllü, 2015 ). The following elaborate model is used:.(1) G I it  = α 0  + α 1  G F it  + α k  X it  + μ i  + υ t  + ε  it .       Where GI is “green products,” the reaction of the variable. GF denotes the estimated core model for “infrastructure financing,” Xit represents the pattern of additional steering elements impacting “sustainability initiatives,” I represents the constant standard deviation, it represents the constant linear regression from year to year, and I represents the constant county output variable (Table 1 and 2   ).  3.1.2 Variable measurement As a solution to the problem of missing data and in order to account for the persistent characteristics of the rising county sustainable manufacturing sector, we developed a measurement structure to represent an estimate and included the lag time of technological practices into Eq. (2) . In order to ensure the accuracy of the experimental results, both the generalization systemic technique for moments and the differentiating generalized moment-based technique were used for the analysis. Following the specified instructions, the Gaussian mixture model was calibrated.(2) G I it  = β 0  + β 1  G I it − 1   + β 2  G F it  + β k  X it  + μ i  + υ t  + ε  it .       (3) G I it  = β 0  + β 1  trea t i  × pos t t  + ∑ σ j  X it  + μ i  + θ t  + ε  it .       Where i is the region, t is the period from 2000 to 2020, the point of intercept period, and b and c are the calculated parameters. This phrase represents the random fluctuation; The first-order lag item of green process innovation is denoted by the notation lnGPSIit-1. The independent variable X is a counterpoint to the two independent variables (ER, environmental regulation, GFs, and green funding in the form of governmental subsidy). The process is expanded to all possible thresholds. By doing so, a panel model may be constructed to see whether there is a direct correlation between environmental regulations and green growth. This approach needs to be revised due to the artificial period division that permits an incorrect forecast. Hansen's single-threshold method is included in the panel approach with the double-threshold approach.  3.1.3 Theoretical background Through the lens of non-asset expenditure and energy consumption, this research examines the impact of the global energy trilemma and the transformational production of energy on the SDGs' economic growth and environmental sustainability between 2000 and 2021. underlying variables that function as an intermediary. We began by arguing from the perspective of a two-sector production model predicated on transforming energy technologies and capital-intensive products. Extensive R&D in the energy sector drives the creation of knowledge-containing intermediate financial instruments and subsequent technical developments. The variable production capital (Ki) will include various investment products that may be paired with any input (Wang and Kong, 2021 ). These objectives cover the whole spectrum of sustainable development, from the economic to the social to the environmental. The shift to renewable energy sources is a particularly important part in achieving these goals. In addition to alleviating the environmental problems caused by traditional fossil fuels, clean energy also plays a crucial role in reviving the economy. Understanding the complex interplay between SDGs and sustainable energy is particularly important in the case of China, a country marked by fast economic development and serious environmental concerns. Renewable energy sources including wind, solar, hydro, and biomass have risen to prominence as a major contributor to economic expansion. It's a crucial tool for mitigating climate change's effects, increasing energy independence, and cutting emissions of greenhouse gases. In addition, the clean energy industry is a tremendous engine for economic growth, a magnet for large investment, and a driver of scientific advancement. In both production and consumption, China now leads the world thanks to its massive investment in sustainable energy infrastructure. It is crucial to investigate how well these investments fit in with SDGs while also fostering growth in the economy. It is crucial to recognize that the SDGs are not an independent agenda confined to the spheres of environmental or social development; rather, they are inextricably tied to the field of economic progress. Finding a middle ground between material progress, ecological protection, and social fairness is essential to sustainable development. To achieve this balance, China must shift to a more sustainable and resource-efficient economic model. This shift is in line with SDGs and is crucial to the future of the country's growth. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how progress toward the SDGs affects economic performance. It is impossible to exaggerate China's importance to the development of the renewable energy sector. China's energy decisions have worldwide repercussions because of the country's size and economic importance. The country's commitment to international climate agreements, as exemplified by its participation in the Paris Agreement, its investments in renewable energy technologies, and its measures to combat pollution and reduce carbon emissions all highlight its importance in the global sustainability discourse. Therefore, a powerful case study with global implications may be gained from a comprehensive examination of the effects of China's pursuit of SDGs via the adoption of clean energy. The purpose of this essay is to provide evidence that Sustainable Development Goals and sustainable energy are driving economic development in China. This study aims to examine data, identify trends, and assess policy effects to better understand the interplay between sustainable development, the adoption of clean energy options, and the promotion of economic growth. Insights from this study may help governments, corporations, and international stakeholders find common ground in their pursuit of economic development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  3.1.4 Validation of mechanisms This study gives quantitative proof for the effects of green recovery via its physical elements (links). After that, below are the specific steps involved in confirmation. We may create nonlinear techniques of estimating the parameters of the underlying processes for green bonds (GF) by using the importance of variable 1 in Eq. (1) . Add GF (green financing) and M. (5) to Eq. to make it a different equation. The relative importance of the aforementioned mechanical effects depends on a number of factors. The possible notation for Eqs. (4)  and (5)  is:(4) M it  = γ 0  + γ 1  G F it  + γ k  X it  + μ i  + υ t  + φ it .       (5) G I it  = θ 0  + θ 1  G F it  + θ 2  M it  + θ k  X it  + μ i  + υ t  + ξ it .       where M represents monetary growth, manufactured infrastructure development, and research and development investment expenditure growth   3.2 Facts & figures (Eco-friendly developments) According to (Hafezi and Zolfagharinia, 2018 ) the number of trademark applications for “sustainable creation” filed by publicly listed enterprises in a given region may be interpreted as a rough measure of the sophistication of the local IT infrastructure. Renewable energy production, transportation, environmental friendliness, environmental services, reforestation, government oversight and building design, nuclear power, and nuclear technology are all major areas in which the “Green Directory of Trade Marks Certification” places clean technologies. Patent protection for innovations is by far the most cutting edge of the three inventions, and this list is often utilized by scholars as a supplement to other techniques of evaluating innovativeness. The purpose of this study was to examine the link between green recovery and creativity; the green creation patent used as a proxy for the defining feature of sustainability methods. 3.2.1 Independent variable Green financial policy is the independent variable. The National University of Business and Economic Studies has released its annual rating of development partnerships for the last several years. To our knowledge, this study is the first of its type to evaluate green recovery in specific Chinese municipalities. As a result,(Sebestyén and Abonyi, 2021 ) created a comparable method for monitoring the development of green funding. The index system also takes into consideration 27 other factors, such as the number of different environmental coverage types that have been recorded, the availability of ecological risk evaluations, and the presence of military hardware. This study uses an index software that was built to calculate the degree of green recovery in 30 provinces throughout China among 2010 and 2019. Several factors, not only the current situation of the green finance business, may have an effect on local technology companies. The economic growth (GDP), technological research and development (rd), preservation of the environment expenditure (hum), and openness (open) as appropriate control parameters. Data analysis money was characterized as one million yuan in advanced manufacturing pollution prevention financing, while national environment investment was represented as one million yuan in total.   3.3 Data This study made use of thirty distinct Chinese districts' worth of geographical data covering the years 2000 and 2020. The primary sources were the China Financial Annual, EPS databases, provincial public records, the China Intellectual Property the Organization, and local carbon trading performance indexes and evaluations. Notably, data limitations meant that no Tibetans could participate in the research.   4 Results and discussion This study mapped out the connections between green funding and green process innovation. There is a solid connection between green product development and environmental protection. There are less monetary obstacles to putting green technological and intellectual advances into practice thanks to green banking accounts. Stable financial conditions have an obvious and far-reaching effect on technological endeavors because they permit a large influx of foreign funds that may be used to fully satisfy the sector's enormous financing needs. Therefore, the nexus is useful for connecting ethical investment with green products that can aid in the fight against climate change. To further investigate the connections between the various metrics, we calculated correlation coefficients. All factors exhibit modest correlations with China's energy consumption, as shown in Table 3  , proving that autocorrelation is not a problem. The energy consumption of naturally ventilated buildings decreased by 1 % for each additional GGFI level. Carbon dioxide emissions are lowered in response to increases in Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) and vice versa. When the BER is increased by one unit, the energy consumption drops by half a unit, and vice versa. For every 1 rise in median family income, there will be a 0.494 % decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, and vice versa. Extreme Programming (XP) has been shown to reduce GHG emissions by 0.661 % per unit deployed. To account for individual variation in the econometric techniques, we have been used the GMM structure, namely the SYS- and DIFF-GMM techniques (see Columns and of Table 4  ). The results of the Johansen test and the Ra estimates are consistent with those of the standard maximum likelihood technique. Even after addressing the issues with the missing factors, the estimate results from Models (2) are comparable to those from Models (1), and the GF's variables are still highly positive, demonstrating that maintainable finance is still adaptable to stimulating innovation. Initial results are consistent. The accumulated benefit of Gf's lagged parameter is considerable. The study looked for unit roots, and then they followed the advice of (Chen & Zhang, 2021) and applied the probability density long-run equilibrium relationship (Tables 3  present quantile-wise estimations of the constants in the vector error correction figure). Finally, we confirm that the projected long-term values for the correlation between renewable financing and Pollutant emissions increase. We also demonstrate that the correlations between green financing and Carbon intensity vary widely among the countries included here. The probabilistic density vector error correction findings in Table 3  provide more evidence for the nonlinear relationship between green budgets and carbon dioxide emissions. In Table 5   we can see the results of our DID estimations. Even without controlling for fixed variables, the results are displayed in Column (1), and the coefficient value for preserved thereafter is substantial. Column 2 contains the province's parameter estimations, which are added to the information in Column 1 to give the treated comment a 5 percent weight. The independent variables of nations and time periods in the econometric results in columns (4) indicate that the treated subsequent parameter continues to be positive. For the placebo test, “fake” research procedures were developed to guarantee statistical significance. After randomly splitting the data into a control and experimental group, an estimate was calculated using the DID technique. Following this approach for a total of 11.9 %, our DID estimator's posterior distribution has a sampling distribution centered at around 0. The genuine processes effect, an anomaly, is shown in the image's bottom panel. The benchmark coefficient of determination is very unlikely due to the random selection of the processed sample. Overall, the results of the placebo test suggest that green money may improve the prevalence of innovation capabilities in a given location. Green recovery may offer individualized financial support for a green economy, which in turn may provide consumers a new reason to spend. This is because the availability of resources and environmental conditions are two of the key constraints restricting economic development. As a consequence of green financing, local microfinance institutions are allocating less resources to the “two outstanding and one down” sectors in favor of those in the environmental, minimum, and resource industries. By regulating the flow of sustainable funds and supporting their expansion, local microfinance institutions may be able to direct more money into promoting investment. A decade of economic growth was used as a regression coefficient to verify this procedure. Table 6   shows results from Model (1) in Column (1), Model (4) in Column (2), and Concept (5) in Columns (2) and (3). This is evidence that investing in renewable energy helps boost economies, which in turn increases the availability of environmentally friendly goods throughout the globe. There are numerous types of accounting systems. The findings suggest that modifying the amount of colored moisturizers in conjunction with a tax incentive method might help influence the environment. An extra 0.3 % of an effect would be seen in 1 % of instances. Studies show how encouraging innovation and adaptability may boost a company's bottom line and lead to greater technical efficiency on the job. At a significance level of one percentage point, the participant's incremental effect on development (represented by the average route's 2.7 % chance) is critical. It's possible that small enterprises that value ease of funding more than independence may benefit from outside policy actions. For every 1 % of authority a person attains, they add 34 % to their actual contribution to creative creation. Our case is strengthened by the fact that limited liability corporations are more likely to enhance themselves via the limitation of internal organizational outcomes. Management firms have attracted more investors because of their commitment to green product development. It's visible at the 3 % level of significance. In many other contexts, entrepreneurial orientation improves by 2.02 percentage points, while both internal and external information engagement both increase by 3 percentage points. Involvement with both internal and external sources of information is correlated with a 1 % increase in inventiveness. We tamed the next decade by focusing on certain industries. Results from Programs 1, 4, and 5 are shown in column 1 through 3 of Table 7  . After factoring in the problem-causing potential, the r2 value of GF in Column (3) is negative, indicating the existence of the mediator encouraging industrial growth. This demonstrates how green recovery contributes to the improvement of the infrastructure, and that in turn stimulates creative activity in many areas. Large sums of money will need to be spent on the research if we're going green, and neither government money nor corporate backing will make much of a difference. This means that providing research and development funds to businesses is the only viable option for promoting sustainability projects in China. No research, however, has examined whether or if corporations will return their profits made via eco-friendly and cost-effective practices back into technological innovation. The influence of green cash assistance on other industries was assessed via testing for usability using funding as an intermediary effect. The results of Models 1, 4, and 5 are shown in the first three columns of Table 8  . The GF correlation coefficients value of 0.016 in Column 3 is lower than it would be without the full discussions element being added in Paragraph (1), suggesting that R&D spending plays a significant moderation role and providing evidence that environmentally responsible bank funding is intended to be put toward R&D in order to boost inventiveness in specific regions. Efforts to encourage ecological finance and renewable energy have the potential to alter greenhouse gas emissions and financial growth. In order to encourage people to switch to renewable energy sources, economists devise strategies to lower the cost of switching. The term “renewable” refers to energy that is generated from non-depleting resources that also benefit ecosystems and the economy. Reported by (Gyaneshwar et al., 2022 ) During the period covered by this research, China's CO2 emissions are projected to increase. Among the many programs and initiatives undertaken by the Chinese government to fight the effects of global warming are the establishment of a national weather intellect service; the introduction of air quality marketing regulations; the development and implementation of climate changes software, techniques, and intentions; and the integration of environmental issues adaptive capacity into its reducing poverty efforts. These measures have generated a strong incentive for advancing the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development on a global scale, and have contributed greatly to its realization (Treiblmaier and Sillaber, 2021 ). In 2019, President Xi Jinping of China said that his country will work toward achieving net zero emissions by 2065, with energy demand peaking by 2035. The Chinese government has stated its intention to publish an article in 2020 titled “Asia's Procedures and Methods to Identify Sustainability Issues,” in which it will detail its plans for sticking to the restricted development curve, implement democratic management to reduce contaminating things, and intentionally explore various structures of limited development. It also highlights China's dedication to maximizing its energy use, achieving rapid energy independence, and minimizing its greenhouse environmental imprint. To achieve its carbon independence goals, the Asian government conducts a comprehensive sustainability scientific achievement throughout the region's economy and culture (Shao and Er, 2016 ). E In addition, it is a potent instrument for dealing with these and other issues linked to environmental safeguards. Integrating environmental and technical progress into “sustainable development practices” may provide a link between biological stability and increased production.It's the bedrock of eco-friendly development and social change, the foundation for bringing about a shift in the energy sector, and the key to meeting the double-carbon target (Shao and Er, 2016 ). Furthermore, due of the difficulties intrinsic to green goods, such as long R&D times, large possibilities of failure, and poor returns, there is a lack of environmentally friendly innovations and insufficient motives for environmentally conscious Research & development operations in China. To be at the forefront of sustainable methods in today's free market economy, corporations and higher learning institutions must be ready to invest in innovative technology (Sun et al., 2020 ). However, in order to make a profit, capitalism must balance innovation with more traditional sources of funding. The late 18th National Convention suggested that in order to boost the power and sanitation sectors' intrinsic drive, the government should establish a cleaner manufacturing organization and actively promote financial sustainability across sectors. As a source of external environmental finance, the investment strategy is not only an integral part of the product for implementing environmentally friendly growth. Thus, sustainable finance's rapid expansion has fueled the development of ecologically beneficial technology. Without advancements in green technology, environmentally conscious development goals cannot be achieved. In the present economic context, the savings will presumably be invested in renewable energy projects designed to limit the pace of ecological catastrophe. Funding still seems to be attached to polluting activities that make things even worse, despite the fact that many efforts have been made to reduce environmental deterioration. Despite the importance of long-term financing in implementing green technology, not nearly enough is being invested in green products. The first investment in solar projects is costly and fraught with danger. Since the rate of return is poor, the development of eco-friendly technology is severely stunted. Traditional financial institutions are hesitant to finance green technology due to the inherent risks connected with these projects. It has been proposed that involving the financial sector more actively in sustainable electricity and ecological innovation activities is a viable option. Most of the research on this topic views the power structure as a multichannel command arrangement that influences the timing of decisions and the feasibility of compromises in decentralized production systems. Based on an examination of supplier and discounter manufacturing procedures, (Kumar and Anandarao, 2019 ) found that gaming industry executives favored operational income arrangements. Researchers looked at how students' empowerment (i.e., their ability to lead) affected the reliability of a manufacturing process involving large manufacturers and distribution. Findings from this study suggest that income from controlling the manufacturing process might be significantly impacted by instabilities. They also said that the more well-rounded the team is, the more they would benefit monetarily from being shielded from outside competition. (Sotero et al., 2022 ) found that when looking at multiple channels governance structures within a constrained manufacturing chain, supplier patterns proved to be the most effective management channels. The relevance of link strength and cohesion in funding manufacturing chains was studied by. They found that effective networking leads to higher-quality profits, whereas market leadership is necessary for sustainable expansion. The conflicts between nonprofits and their local suppliers and their constituents were examined.  5 Conclusions and limitations 5.1 Conclusion A vast body of work is dedicated to the “resource curse.” This research employs the econometric approach to investigate the impact of monetary constraints on the advancement of green growth in the economy and sustainable growth objectives, using a sample of Chinese publicly traded corporations between 2000 and 2020. Several obstacles hinder the monetary aspects and monetary growth of resource-poor nations, notwithstanding their abundance of natural resources. The VAR approach is the way to go if you want to conduct a thorough study that yields valuable insights into pressing policy concerns. These analyses show only a single order of integration for each component. The VAR technique uses quantiles to examine the connection between parameters. The resource curse theory is supported by NIS's numerically substantial negative effect on ES in China. General financial development in China has slowed as the authorities take longer to formulate a strategy for the country's economy. The impact of China's resource curse was also alleviated by decentralized fiscal administration and innovation in finance, which enhanced ES. The long-term link between China's two dependent and independent variables is recovering since the model's error correction variable was likewise substantially negative. The Wald and Granger cause-and-effect tests corroborate the magnitude and direction of the correlation postulated by VAR. The “resource curse” hypothesis backs the results of this investigation as it is understood in China. Given its wealth of natural resources, China can break the resource curse if it adopts the new metrics proposed here and puts them to good use in increasing residential demand. Manufacturing. Now more than ever, efficient use of available resources is crucial. Instead of raising money by exporting resources and minerals, government entities may try to do so by supporting additional value exports. The federal government should promote self-financing, co-financing, and inter-governmental funds transfers as part of fiscal decentralization to further improve the system of finance at the state level. Since technical progress has been proven to have a good effect on ES, the government should work to strengthen the economy as it is. That's why it's so important to invest heavily in R&D to help the economy adapt to new technologies. Maintaining trade earnings and monetary safety also depends on the dependable enforcement of contracts. The state's emphasis on policy stability suggests that similar procedures be implemented to address the severe NIS problem.  5.2 Policy implications Investing in renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and hydroelectric power is crucial if China is to meet the SDGs and achieve clean energy and economic stability. Investment in these areas, from both local and international sources, has been shown to increase GDP growth and cut GHG emissions significantly. It is also crucial to encourage technical innovation in energy efficiency and sustainable energy sources. To hasten the shift toward a sustainable energy environment, the government should push companies and people to use clean energy solutions by providing subsidies, tax advantages, and other incentives. The SDGs can only be achieved if China strengthens its regulatory framework to guarantee that environmental standards are enforced and sustainable activities are encouraged. To do so, we must set quantifiable goals for reducing emissions, institute carbon pricing systems, and strictly enforce compliance costs. Promoting international cooperation and partnership within the renewable energy industry is also crucial. China has to have strong partnerships with other countries to share information and learn from each other. This cooperative effort not only furthers the nation's goals in the area of clean energy, but also contributes considerably to the wider attainment of the SDGs on a global scale, making the SDGs more achievable and paving the way for a more sustainable future for everyone.  5.3 Future research The number of greenhouse gases created by human activity has grown despite several energy price policies meant to address pollution.■ Power plants that use fossil fuels continue to grow their CO2 emissions despite widespread government and industry attempt to curb their use and pollution.  ■ Getting the transport industry to emit less greenhouse gases is a significant focus of productivity improvement efforts. Nevertheless, overall oil consumption and vehicle miles traveled are still growing, contributing to increased carbon dioxide emissions, despite great advances in this field.  ■ Third, addressing the effects of growing energy prices is more complex than implementing any program to reduce GHG emissions. But only internationally can the benefits be fully recognized over time.  ■ Short-term gains from adaptability are more significant than long- or even medium-term gains. This causes concern since it might be beneficial to back out of mitigating commitments.  ■ Spending less on preventative makes sense economically and socially for the time being, but from a global perspective, a quicker reaction is required to cut energy prices. Because of the competitive nature of politics at home, lawmakers and governments are often wary of investing in initiatives that primarily benefit other countries.
