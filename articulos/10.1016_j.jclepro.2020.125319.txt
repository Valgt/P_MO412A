                  The 2030 Agenda recognizes the role of the private sector and calls on its innovative and creative capabilities to help solve sustainable development challenges. Judging by the embracement of the SDGs in sustainability reporting, this call seems to resonate. However, the extent to which companies actually make a contribution to solving SDG challenges remains unclear.
                  This paper aims to explore this innovative contribution to the SDGs. It does so by assessing the level of SDG relevant innovation by the largest multinational enterprises in the world.
                  We develop a method for the identification of SDG relevant patent applications, distinguishing between “green” patents, related to environmental themes, and “blue” patents, related to “improving conditions” and meeting unmet sustainable development needs. In addition, we explore whether the level of SDG relevant innovation is systematically associated with a number of company characteristics.
                  Our results show that large MNEs have similar levels of green patents, and lower levels of blue patents, compared to smaller companies. Using regression analysis, we find that there are regional and industry-specific differences. Corporate sustainable development attributes such as Global Compact membership and sustainability reporting, are less convincingly associated. It can be concluded that MNEs play an important role in SDG relevant innovation, but that there are trade-offs between different SDGs. Some SDG relevant innovation is not commonly associated with sustainable development.
                  This study attempts to quantify the actual effect of sustainability strategies of companies by identifying their sustainable patents and associates this to company characteristics, using a new method for sustainable patent identification. Moreover, SDG relevant innovation is taken beyond green innovation to include the whole range of technical innovation that is related to the broad range of SDGs.

Handling Editor. Dr Sandra Caeiro The 2030 Agenda recognizes the role of the private sector and calls on its innovative and creative capabilities to help solve sustainable development challenges. Judging by the embracement of the SDGs in sustainability reporting, this call seems to resonate. However, the extent to which companies actually make a contribution to solving SDG challenges remains unclear. This paper aims to explore this innovative contribution to the SDGs. It does so by assessing the level of SDG relevant innovation by the largest multinational enterprises in the world. We develop a method for the identification of SDG relevant patent applications, distinguishing between “green” patents, related to environmental themes, and “blue” patents, related to “improving conditions” and meeting unmet sustainable development needs. In addition, we explore whether the level of SDG relevant innovation is systematically associated with a number of company characteristics. Our results show that large MNEs have similar levels of green patents, and lower levels of blue patents, compared to smaller companies. Using regression analysis, we find that there are regional and industry-specific differences. Corporate sustainable development attributes such as Global Compact membership and sustainability reporting, are less convincingly associated. It can be concluded that MNEs play an important role in SDG relevant innovation, but that there are trade-offs between different SDGs. Some SDG relevant innovation is not commonly associated with sustainable development. This study attempts to quantify the actual effect of sustainability strategies of companies by identifying their sustainable patents and associates this to company characteristics, using a new method for sustainable patent identification. Moreover, SDG relevant innovation is taken beyond green innovation to include the whole range of technical innovation that is related to the broad range of SDGs.   Graphical abstract Image 1       Keywords sustainability-oriented innovation  patents  multinational enterprises  SDGs  global challenges  sustainability reporting    1 Introduction The 2030 Agenda is a global plan of action for sustainable development, adopted by the United Nations in September 2015 (United Nations, 2015 ). The Agenda addresses the broad global challenges of climate change, social inequality and environmental degradation by a global governance framework containing 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with 167 targets. These include ending poverty and hunger, combating inequalities, building peaceful, just and inclusive societies, protecting human rights, promoting gender equality and ensuring the lasting protection of the planet and its natural resources (United Nations, 2015 , p. 3). The Agenda is not exclusively addressing the governments of the UN member states. It also recognizes the role that the private sector can play in realizing the goals. Acknowledging their contribution to productivity, inclusive economic growth and job creation, the Agenda encourages businesses “(…) to apply their creativity and innovation to solving sustainable development challenges” (United Nations, 2015 , p. 25). As the SDGs have been introduced only recently, there is a scarcity of empirical studies on the engagement of the private sector with the SDGs. Most of this research is related to non-financial corporate reporting, which is also an explicit objective of the Agenda (target 12.6). The share of MNEs mentioning the SDGs in their sustainability reports is still limited, while the nature of the SDG disclosure appeared to be positively worded and symbolic rather than measurable and substantive (Van der Waal and Thijssens, 2020 ). SDG mentioning appeared also to be linked to institutional factors (Rosati and Faria, 2019 ; Van der Waal and Thijssens, 2020 ). SDG related disclosure is mainly focusing at “avoiding harm” topics, such as emission prevention (Van Zanten and Van Tulder, 2018 ). As a result, prior literature cannot provide clarity on the extent to which companies really make a contribution to solving SDG challenges. In particular, the question of how MNEs help to solve sustainable development challenges across the broad range of SDGs has not been empirically researched. In this study, we suggest that the extent to which a company spends money on innovation regarding sustainable products, services or processes is a more objective measure for corporate SDG involvement than the SDG information in their sustainability reports. Over the years, the private sector has shown much innovation related to cleaner production and ecology , driven by market demand for cleaner products, increasing environmental regulations, cost savings and environmental management systems (Hojnik and Ruzzier, 2016 ). However, the SDGs are not limited to the environmental challenges. Hence, in this study we draw on the sustainability-oriented innovation (SOI) literature. SOI is a broader field of study including both eco-innovation and the often overlooked social dimension (Adams et al., 2016 ; Klewitz and Hansen, 2014 ) and spans the entire range of SDGs. As empirical literature shows that MNEs’ engagement in SOI is scarcely researched, the aim of this study is to explore the extent to which MNEs engage in SOI. More specifically, we aim to explore SOI that is relevant to the SDGs, which we label "SDG relevant innovation" in the context of this study. With this aim in mind, we explore the level of SDG relevant technical innovation for a sample of the 2000 largest stock listed MNEs worldwide. We measure SDG relevant innovation by developing a framework for the identification of SDG relevant patent applications from the European Patent database. The framework is based on SOI and distinguishes between "green" patents and "blue’" patents. Green patents refer to cleaner production and eco-efficiency, while blue patents relate to unmet sustainable development needs, such as reducing poverty, zero hunger, health and well-being, education, biodiversity, water and sanitation. To identify sustainable patents, a dedicated thesaurus was developed with technical keywords derived from the source texts of the 2030 Agenda (SDGs, targets and indicators). To further explore MNEs engagement, the level of SDG relevant innovation is analyzed for potential systematic associations with a number of company characteristics. The results show that large MNEs have similar levels of green patents, and lower levels of blue patents, compared to smaller companies. Using regression analysis, we find that there are regional and industry-specific differences in the level of SDG relevant innovation, as well as differences associated with sustainability reporting and sustainability membership attributes (Global Compact). The value of this study is that it provides insight in the SDG relevant technical innovation by MNEs, while contrasting it with sustainability disclosure provides more insight in the strategic coherence between the two themes and the substance of the latter. In what follows, we first present an outline of the state of relevant literature, followed by a detailed explanation of the method developed and applied (section 3 ). The results are presented and discussed in section 4 , and conclusions formulated in section 5 .  2 Literature review 2.1 Corporate engagement with the SDGs The SDGs are quickly taken up by the business sector as an initiative that is important for their strategy, interaction with society and corporate communication. A majority of large companies mention the SDGs in their reporting publications (Scott and McGill, 2019 ). However, their inclusion in published business strategy is much less frequent, not to speak of measuring performance against SDG targets (Scott and McGill, 2019 ). Academic interest in private sector SDG engagement so far has been fragmented, ranging from critical discussion of the role of business (Scheyvens et al., 2016 ), studying the role of business networks in corporate adoption of the SDGs (Williams et al., 2019 ), the development of frameworks for integration of SDGs into strategy (Muff et al., 2017 ), and to reviewing SDG related business models (Raith and Siebold, 2018 ). Empirical research on corporate engagement with the SDGs is scarce and has been directed at gauging corporate SDG priorities (Ike et al., 2019 ; Van Zanten and Van Tulder, 2018 ) and assessing the relation between the SDGs and sustainability reporting. García-Sánchez et al., 2020a  found that institutional investor ownership positively influenced the amount of disclosure related to the 2030 Agenda by corporations, while, paradoxically, SDG relevant disclosure was also found to prompt sell recommendations by analysts, apparently considering SDG engagement as an agency cost not in the interest of shareholders (García-Sánchez et al., 2020b ). Another research strand focused on the relationship of SDG reporting and organizational factors, such as company size, Global Compact membership, board composition, and institutional factors, such as country of origin and industry. It was also found that SDG reporting barely surpassed a symbolic level, e.g. by a simple mentioning of the SDGs (Rosati and Faria, 2019 ; Van der Waal and Thijssens, 2020 ). Apart from the previous, empirical work explicitly covering the private sector contribution across the full range of SDGs is largely absent. Other empirical work is limited to some studies focusing on private sector contribution to specific SDGs, e.g. Goal 3 "Good Health and Wellbeing" (Haywood and Wright, 2019 ); or to studies addressing the broader question of private sector contribution to sustainable development, which theme predated the SDGs and has received considerable scholarly attention (Burritt et al., 2020 ; Kolk and van Tulder, 2010 ). Yet, the 2030 Agenda’s explicit call on the private sector expresses a belief in an active role for companies to use resources and capabilities to help solve sustainable development issues. Hence, knowledge of whether this belief corresponds with the extent to which enterprises actually take on this active role is needed. The actual innovation efforts of enterprises relating to sustainability may form a more appropriate measure expressing this role, due to the required substantial investments, than less-committal activities, such as reporting. Moreover, innovation efforts can be quantified by R&D expenditure or intellectual property rights. The theme lends itself well to making SDG engagement visible. However, since private sector contribution to the SDGs is a young research field, the innovative role has not yet been explicitly linked to the SDGs. Therefore, we review the state of innovation literature related to sustainability in the next section.  2.2 Sustainability-oriented innovation There is a stream of literature on sustainability-oriented innovation (SOI), which includes both the environmental and social aspects of sustainability covered by the SDGs (Adams et al., 2016 ). Of these two, the environmental aspect is the most directly actionable in business contexts, driven by market demand for cleaner products, increasing environmental regulations and cost savings, and therefore dominant in a broad stream of literature on industrial ecology (Sullivan et al., 2018 ) and corporate eco-innovation (He et al., 2018 ; Klewitz and Hansen, 2014 ; Kuo and Smith, 2018 ; Salim et al., 2019 ). Responsible innovation adds to this a governance and responsibility aspect (Voegtlin and Scherer, 2017 ). In this study, we approach corporate innovation relevant the SDGs from the broad scope of SOI, explicitly not restricted to environmental or green innovation. There is no consensus about what sustainability exactly means, how it can be achieved and what kinds of innovation can be called sustainable. Different terms and definitions are used when relating innovation to sustainability, with sustainable innovation and SOI being found most frequently. Both terms can refer to “innovations in which the renewal or improvement of products, services, technological or organizational processes not only delivers an improved economic performance, but also an enhanced environmental and social performance, both in the short and long term and have the capacity to generate positive social and environmental impacts ” (Bos-Brouwers, 2010 ). Like sustainability, SOI has multiple dimensions. First, operational optimization concerns “doing more with less” and relates to regulatory compliance, eco-efficiency and greening. Second, organizational transformation concerns “doing good by doing new things”, going beyond greening. Lastly, systems building is focused at “doing good by doing new things with others”, emphasizing collaborative innovative efforts (Adams et al., 2016 ). Discussing responsible innovation, Voegtlin and Scherer (2017)  distinguish between “innovations that avoid harming people and the planet”  and “innovations that improve conditions for people and the planet”  and connect these to the social and environmental SDGs. They also point at the dual effect of an innovation: beneficial for one sustainability aspect, but harmful for another. This notion is also relevant in connection with the SDGs, where fostering one goal may have adverse impacts on another goal, and thus require nexus-based governance: governance that enables "co-benefits and reduces trade-offs" (van Zanten and van Tulder, 2020 ). The concepts of green, eco or ecological, and environmental innovation are not always well defined. They overlap and are often used interchangeably, but are nevertheless the more widely studied dimension of SOI (Díaz-García et al., 2015 ; He et al., 2018 ). Compared to this green, "avoiding harm" dimension, the "improve conditions" or social dimension is under-exposed (Khan, 2016 ; Schiederig et al., 2012 ). Our own exploratory literature review confirms this picture. Fig. 1   shows the number of peer-reviewed articles in the EBSCO database between 2015 and 2020 that had one or more topical keywords in the titles. It is clear that the green topics are dominant and that the connection with SDG s has hardly been made. Making the connection with the SDGs is relatively straightforward for the literature based on green innovation. For example, Walz et al. (2017)  relate green innovation, like energy efficiency and waste management, to specific relevant SDGs. However, the SDGs embody sustainability in the broad sense and also include society-focused, “unmet needs”, or “improving conditions” themes, such as eradicating poverty and hunger, drinking water and sanitation. Various aspects of SOI, and particularly green innovation, have been studied in relation to enterprises, such as the drivers for innovation (Hojnik and Ruzzier, 2016 ), the impact of green innovation on financial performance (Lin et al., 2019 ) and organizational capabilities related to SOI (Salim et al., 2019 ). However, SOI by MNEs, related to the broad range of SDGs, has hardly been studied empirically. A few studies have focused mostly on the green dimension, such as low-carbon technologies (Albino et al., 2014 ), climate-change (Durán-Romero and Urraca-Ruiz, 2015 ) or resource-efficiency (Slowak and Regenfelder, 2017 ). Studies connecting innovation to all dimensions of SOI and connecting these across the width of the SDGs are even scarcer. One of the few examples is a study of the SDG contribution of the European mining sector by Endl et al. (2019) . There is a clear lack of knowledge of the innovative contribution of MNEs across the full range of SDGs. The current study aspires to fill this void. The central research question relates to the extent to which MNEs contribute across the full width of SDGs by means of SOI; that is: To what extent do MNEs engage in SDG relevant innovations? Questions arising from this are:a) how is SOI distributed over the SDGs?  b) what characteristics of MNEs are systematically associated with SDG relevant innovation?    In the next section we will elaborate on the methodological choices that were made in order to answer the above research questions.   3 Methodology and data collection 3.1 Research methodology We approach the research question by exploring SDG relevant innovation of large MNEs using a novel method, based on content analysis of patents. Next to a descriptive statistics exploration, we also explore whether differences in SDG-related SOI are systematically associated with company specific factors, such as size, industry, the level of sustainability reporting and country, using exploratory multivariate regression analysis. Although it may seem as if we suggest a causal relationship between SOI -the dependent variable in the regression model- and a number of company specific factors -which are treated as independent variables-, this is not what we intend. Regression analysis is chosen only to allow for multivariate analysis between a large number of factors. Patent texts are not constructed as a communication tool for conveying sustainability information to stakeholders. This makes them an interesting and objective source of information giving insight in the sustainability policy outcomes of applicants. It allows a look behind the “organizational façade” (Abrahamson and Baumard, 2009 ). First, we develop therefore a method to identify sustainable patents connected to the SDGs, which we call "SDG relevant patents". Secondly, the resulting data are described with reference to industry groups and geographic region. Thirdly, sustainability reporting characteristics, including SDG mentioning, and control data are collected. Finally, associations between green and blue SDG relevant patents as dependent variables and company characteristics as independent variables are explored, though without implying any causal relationships.  3.2 Sample The sample contains companies on the Forbes Global 2000 list, edition 2017. Given the large size of the companies, virtually all companies in the list are MNEs. As our SOI-measure is based on patents, non-technology-driven sectors (GICS sectors 30 (Consumer Staples), 40 (Financials) and 60 (Real Estate)) are excluded. In this way, 1178 companies were retained.  3.3 The dependent variable: Identifying SDG relevant patents Patent are legal-technical texts, describing the technical novelty of inventions to patent offices. They are frequently used to measure green innovation (Pianta and Archibugi, 1996 ). Patents have a title, keywords, an abstract, a description and technical claims and are classified according to the technical field of the invention using the International Patent Classification (IPC). To identify green patents, the OECD has developed a list of environmental technology related IPC codes (Haščič and Migotto, 2015 ). The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) has developed a similar inventory (Fujii and Managi, 2016 ). These sets have been used to study various aspects of green innovation, such as policy and networks (Fabrizi et al., 2018 ), the effect of corporate governance (Amore and Bennedsen, 2016 ), and the relation with environmental disclosure (Radu and Francoeur, 2017 ). However, using IPC codes is a rather coarse-meshed method, because they refer to singular classes of technologies, not to applications for use or reasons for development. The green IPCs do not cover “improved conditions” and social sustainability. This is also almost impossible with IPC codes, because the technical field of such inventions may not be directly related to the problem they intend to solve, such as mobile information technology inventions applied to pro-poor rural banking. IPC patent classifications cannot comprehensively cover all of the SDGs. We therefore envisaged to identify application or relevance rather than technology. Analogous to Xie and Miyazaki (2013) , we compiled a thesaurus of SDG innovation related keywords, allowing to search for SDG related applications, advantages and relevance in patent texts. The constitutive documents of the 2030 Agenda  serve as basis: The UN Resolution (United Nations, 2015 ) and the Global Indicator Framework annex (United Nations, 2017 ). Every single target was marked to relate to environmental or other sustainability aspects if they contained technical aspects. Environmental targets were labeled "green" and non-environmental targets (social, "unmet needs", "improve conditions") “blue”.1  1 Loosely coined after the “blue ocean” strategy concept referring to “untapped market space, demand creation, and opportunity for growth (Kim and Mauborgne, 2005 ), more socially oriented.   Strings of technical keywords were coded that would be specific enough to match with patent descriptions. Some wider non-technical concepts in the texts, were converted into narrower, technical keywords more probable to appear in patent vocabulary. For example, the keyword “neglected tropical diseases (NTDs)” was broken down into specific diseases mentioned on the WHO NTD list.2  2 https://www.who.int/topics/tropical_diseases/factsheets/neglected/en/ .   The keyword malnutrition, was broken down into undernourishment, micronutrient deficiency and obesity. Keyword strings were chosen and tested carefully to avoid type I (missing relevant patents) or type II errors (including irrelevant patents) (Xie and Miyazaki, 2013 ). Two lists (green and blue) of keywords ensued from this exercise. A few keywords appeared in both lists but appeared in different SDGs, e.g. climate change (SDG 13), which is also connected to poverty (SDG1). Patents sporting one or more lists of keywords in their description fields, where the technical problem or reason for the invention and its broader relevance is described, were designated as SDG relevant patents. The keywords are listed in the supplementary material. The European Patent Database was selected as source.3  3 (https://data.epo.org/expert-services/index.html ), accessed between 1 and 30 November 2019.   It is the most international database with a wide subject range (Kim and Lee, 2015 ) and it is full-text searchable. It contains only European Patents, but applicants have a global origin. As long as Europe is a relevant market for applicants, they are likely to apply for a European Patent. We assume that Europe is a relevant market for most of the MNEs in the sample. If this introduces a certain bias towards European companies, this is reduced because SDG relevant patent counts are related to total patent counts per company. We included patent applications from 2007 to 2017, in order to have sufficiently significant counts. Hence, our dependent variable reflects a company’s "track record" regarding SDG-relevant SOI. Companies may own patents by foreign subsidiaries with a different name, (e.g. General Motors, owning European patents through its Opel subsidiary). These were included under the parent as much as possible. For every company in the sample, the total number of European Patent applications was obtained. Applying the keyword list to this number gave the number of green and blue patents. For comparison, the count of WIPO Green patents was also obtained. Companies were clustered into four regions: USA, Europe, Japan/Korea/Taiwan (JKT), representing the triadic markets and patent families, plus a group of Other countries. The average patent counts per region were different. To reduce the risk of bias, the patent counts were normalized by dividing them by the regional average according to:N o r m a l i z e d  p a t e n t  c o u n t = i n d i v i d u a l  p a t e n t  c o u n t  r e g i o n a l  a v e r a g e  p a t e n t  c o u n t        The dependent variables are the normalized Green and Blue Patent Counts (GPn/BPn).  3.4 The independent variables A number of MNE characteristics were taken as the independent variables. Company size as an important control variable was proxied by the logarithm of the market value (Dang et al., 2018 ). The industry groupings were based on the Global Industry Classification System (levels 1 – Sector - and 2 – Industry Group). The market values and industry groupings were taken from the Forbes list. The sustainability performance is derived from the RobecoSAM (RobecoSam, 2018 ) corporate sustainability assessment rankings, on which the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) is based. It is one of the most well-known and trusted indicators of the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance of large companies (Hawn et al., 2018 ). Corporate sustainability reporting is an important phenomenon that reflects how MNEs voluntarily self-report their ESG impact. Of every MNE, we assessed if the company published a sustainability report (SR) in 2017. If SR is important for an MNE, we expect more attention is devoted to it by using a reporting framework, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) or <IR> integrated reporting, applying external assurance and mentioning the SDGs in the report. SR data were retrieved from corporateregister.com  (accessed February 2018). SDG mentioning was determined by content-analyzing the individual reports. All reporting variables are dummy variables. The Global Compact (GC) is the most important global corporate sustainability initiative, connecting the corporate sector to the United Nations (Perez-Batres et al., 2011 ). By signing up to the GC, a corporation pledges to follow the GC principles for sustainable development. The GC actively promotes the SDGs among the corporate sector. For every company, membership of the GC was recorded. All dependent and independent variables are presented in Table 1  a . The descriptive statistics of count and continuous variables are shown in Table 1 b.  3.5 Statistical model The histogram in Fig. 2   shows that the distribution of patent counts is strongly right-skewed and long-tailed, as is often the case with count data. Table 2  b  confirms this by showing the distribution statistics of the variables. A large proportion of companies (36.8%) does not have any patents, which zero-inflates the data. To analyze count data with overdispersion, a negative binomial regression generalized linear model (GLM) is preferred over a Poisson regression (Coxe et al., 2009 ; O’Hara and Kotze, 2010 ). Negative binomial regression models are frequently applied to patent data (Guo and Trivedi, 2002 ). To compare sustainable innovation to corporate characteristics, we employ two models: Model 1 only includes the companies with patents in the sample, as companies without patents will not have sustainable patents. A total of 747 observations remain.Regression model 1:   GPn/BPn = f{(APn) + Sustainability Reporting + Global Compact + Ranking + Region + Industry + Size + Constant}    Model 2 focuses on companies with patents and a sustainability report, to review if high SDG relevant innovation is also associated to sustainability reporting (SR) characteristics. The sample with patents and SR contains 550 observations.Regression model 2:   GPn/BPn = f{(APn) + GRI + IR + Assurance + SDG + Ranking + GC + Region + Industry Group + Size + Constant}    In both models, the APn term is included, expressing GPn/BPn relative to the total patent (APn) counts, reducing regional bias in absolute counts. Additionally, a logistic regression model was tested for the reverse association between factor variables Global Compact (GC), Sustainability Report (SR), GRI and <IR> frameworks, assurance (ASS) and SDG mentioning, and SDG relevant innovation expressed as the percentage green and blue innovation (pGreen, pBlue). The model takes the form:Regression Model 3:   Probability (GC / SR / GRI / IR / ASS / SDG) = f{(pGreen + pBlue + Ranking + Region + Industry + Size + Constant}    The first two factors variables (GC and SR) are run on the sample with patents, the last four on the sample with patents and an SR. The goodness-of-fit of the models was tested by inspecting residual plots, showing approximately normally distributed residuals. For all models, variance inflation factors (vif) were computed to avoid coefficient instability in case of multicollinearity. They were all well below 3, so that no such problem was expected.   4 Results and discussion 4.1 Innovation across the SDGs The keyword search for individual SDGs was performed jointly for all companies in the sample. Fig. 3   shows how SDG relevant patents are distributed over the SDGs. For every SDG, the number of green and blue patents is shown, with the most frequently appearing keyword. This gives an idea of the nature of the innovations related to specific SDGs. The figure shows that SDG relevant technical innovation is not limited to environmental, green innovation, but that it connects with almost all SDGs to different degrees. Goals 2 and 3 show high scores on blue innovation. The most salient keyword in the patents related to SDG 2 (“Zero Hunger”) is "obesity". This may seem contradictory, but SDG 2 includes malnutrition (Target 2.2), and the so-called “triple burden of malnutrition” consists of undernourishment, micronutrient deficiency and obesity (Pinstrup-Anderson, 2007 ). The most poignant SDG 3 keyword is cancer, which is a keyword of Target 3.4, along with other major diseases, such as AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Not all these keywords are intuitively associated with sustainability or sustainable development. They do appear prominently because the SDGs are based on a broad, integrated and universal concept of sustainability, covering both ecological and human aspects, in both developed and emerging economies. This clearly favors innovations primarily aimed at commercially attractive developed markets, where SDG 3 targets are already more advanced. MNEs do make innovative contributions aimed at combating NTDs, such as malaria and tuberculosis. Such innovations that benefit the least developed countries should in fact weigh more heavily in the appreciation of the contribution of MNEs to the SDGs than medicines against diseases of affluence, even though these are explicitly mentioned in the 2030 Agenda and also increasingly affecting developing countries. The previous illustrates a paradox, inherent in the SDGs: some corporate actions are clearly SDG relevant, yet are not necessarily beneficial for overall sustainable development. Whether an innovation ultimately furthers sustainable development is contingent upon its specific context and its potential adverse impacts on other goals, or even targets within the same goal.  4.2 SDG relevant innovation across geographic regions and industry groups Table 2 a shows the breakdown of sustainable patents of sample MNEs and the total universe in the studied time frame. The 1181 companies in the sample own almost 0.8 million of a total of over 2.3 million patent applications. SDG relevant patents comprise only a small portion (12.2%) of all patents. The counts for green patents (5.4%) and WIPO green patents (5.5%) are comparable. Companies in the sample have similar proportions (5.3%) of green patents as the total universe, making them proportional contributors to green innovation. For blue innovation, their share is lower (3.9% vs 6.8%), making them less than proportional contributors to innovation for improving (social) conditions. Apparently, smaller companies play a more important role in such innovation, and can play an important role in solving SDG grand challenges (Klewitz and Hansen, 2014 ). Table 2 b is a comprehensive view of the composition of the triadic region groups. US companies have a lower average number of patents. An explanation may be that some US companies have a stronger focus on domestic or other non-European markets (Rugman and Verbeke, 2008 ). JKT companies, on the other hand, have a high average number of patents, even higher than European companies, which may correspond to their strong export orientation (Criscuolo, 2005 ). The table also lists the percentages of companies that have sustainability reports with related attributes. It is noticeable that for US companies, Global Compact membership, publishing sustainability reports and mentioning the SDGs are less popular. Fig. 4   shows the average number of total, green and blue patents per industry group. Fig. 5   shows boxplots of the total number of patents per industry group, with the number of MNEs in the group. The dots show that some MNEs have patent counts that are much higher than the median, and these outliers influence the means of Fig. 4 . The Figure shows also that some industry groups have but a few members. Fig. 6   shows the percentages of green and blue patens per industry group. Together, they give an impression of the absolute and relative contributions of the industry groups to SDG relevant innovation, as well as the distribution within the industry groups.  4.3 SDG relevant innovation and individual company characteristics Table 3   shows the correlation matrix for the main regression variables. The real patent counts correlate strongly with the normalized counts, because a linear transformation by region was applied. The WIPO Green count (WP) correlates well with the GP count, which supports the validity of the GP count method. Otherwise, no strong univariate correlations are revealed between the patent counts and other company characteristics. Table 4   shows the results of the multivariate regression models. Residual plots indicated reasonable goodness-of-fit. As expected, SDG relevant patent counts are associated with the number of total patents. There is no significant association of green patents with sustainability reporting, ranking, or Global Compact. That leaves the explanation of variance in SDG relevant innovation to geographical and industry differences and other unobserved variables. No differences in the relative number of SDG relevant patents between the USA and Europe are visible. However, the East-Asian JKT group is significantly more active with green and blue innovation. This is an interesting outcome. A similar observation was made for SDG mentioning in sustainability reporting (Van der Waal and Thijssens, 2020 ). The explanation of the phenomenon is not clear. It may have to do with the specific corporate group and lending structure of Japanese and Korean firms, in which large banks play a major role (Li et al., 2018 ). Other authors connect differences in sustainable innovation orientation to the strength of stakeholder engagement and knowledge management (Ayuso et al., 2011 ), and cultural factors (Ho and Taylor, 2007 ). The multivariate analysis confirms the strong differences exhibited by the industry sectors. The coefficients are all relative to the Energy sector and this is the sector with the relatively highest count of green patents. Other important green innovation contributions come from environmentally sensitive industries such as Materials and Automobiles and Components, explainable by the large environmental footprint of their products. Nevertheless, their percentage of green patents is still small. For the Automobiles industry, this is remarkable, because the quest for more sustainable automotive technology has intensified, especially after the “Dieselgate” scandal (Held et al., 2018 ). Semiconductors show the highest patent average, followed by Commercial & Professional Services, which contains xerographic companies. The Pharmaceutical group has the highest mean of blue patents. This is perhaps no surprise, as the pharmaceutical industry provides many important products to society that improve or even save lives. Some pharmaceutical companies see the SDGs clearly as an inspiration for sustainable business (Pedersen, 2018 ) or have participated in their formulation (Schramade, 2017 ). However, the industry also has chemical pollution and product stewardship risks when drugs are disposed in sewage systems (Kumar et al., 2019 ), and faces criticism concerning access to medicines (Hogerzeil, 2013 ). As discussed in section 4.1 , the pharmaceutical industry is strongly related to SDG 3. The Utilities group, being a technology user rather than developer, has only few patents, but if it develops technology, it pays much attention to green innovation. After Pharma, the Food, Beverage & Tobacco industry scores highest on blue innovations related to better nutrition and hygiene. The Materials group, which includes chemicals, has medium averages of patents, but scores relatively high on green patents. This can be ascribed to plant protection products and other agrochemicals, connected to SDG 2 “Zero Hunger”. This uncovers an internal tension with other SDGs relating to biodiversity, such as SDGs 14 "Life on Land" and SDG 15 "Life Below water". Some industries stand out with large negative signs. These are sectors with low patent counts anyway, showing low technology intensity. Model 1 in Table 3  indicates that there is no association of SDG related innovation with sustainability reporting. The voluntary disclosure practice as an externally oriented corporate activity seems to be disconnected from the internally oriented innovation strategy. Other drivers, derived from stakeholder theory, are known to be important (Hahn and Kühnen, 2013 ), and these are not included in this model. When companies do publish a sustainability report, however, Model 2 aims to show if there are any associations with some attributes of sustainability reporting. Global Compact membership is sometimes associated with just providing a better image or financial gains to members (Arevalo et al., 2013 ; Coulmont and Berthelot, 2015 ), also called “bluewashing” (Berliner and Prakash, 2015 ). In the correlation matrix of Table 3 , there is a weak positive correlation between Global Compact membership and patent counts. The regression shows a small significant association of blue patent counts with GC membership, suggesting that it may be associated with organizational processes, such as innovation, more than just superficially, in line with its intention to be an initiative for learning and networking (Ruggie, 2001 ). The DJSI ranking does not seem to be associated to SDG related innovation. This corresponds to earlier findings that DJSI members do not show higher innovation (Gallego-Álvarez et al., 2011 ). Sustainable innovation is not an item in the corresponding sustainability assessment (S&P Global, 2020 ), but this could be an element to be considered in the future. Model 2 considers SDG relevant innovation, limiting the sample to companies that publish an SR, even though Model 1 shows that reporting is not associated with SDG relevant innovation. GRI and <IR> framework application do not seem to be relevant in the sample. For <IR> this is more remarkable, because integrated reporting aspires to improve the integration and congruence of shareholder and non-financial stakeholder information and in this way break down organizational façades (Perego et al., 2016 ). External assurance, however, seems to be strongly associated to higher blue and green SDG relevant patent scores. It is unclear how this can be explained. SDG mentioning has an association with green innovation. This is an interesting result and gives the impression that companies mentioning the SDGs may engage more substantially with them than previously thought as far as sustainable technical innovation is concerned (Van der Waal and Thijssens, 2020 ). Companies themselves may not even be sufficiently aware of this as SDG relevant innovation is not a topic currently included in reporting guidelines. Table 5   presents the Model 3 logit regressions on the factor variables mentioned above, to confirm if theses associations also appear when the direction of the association is reversed. It confirms the associations found.  4.4 Limitations and areas for further study The study has limitations in that only large stock-listed companies have been considered. Even though they represent a considerable part of SDG relevant patents as reported in this study, smaller companies still constitute the larger part. A further limitation is that only technical innovation is considered, and that not all technical innovations are patented. An innovation may be important from a sustainable and commercial perspective, but not be patentable because it fails the newness criterion required for patentability. The patenting policy between companies may differ, and not all patented innovations lead to marketable products or process implementations (Abbas et al., 2014 ). SDG relevant patents are defined in the specific way of the novel method employed, which is based on technical keywords derived from SDG constitutive texts. This method could be further refined and improved. The study presents a cross-section in time of SDG relevant patents and does not address the question if there is a time dynamic of SDG relevant innovation, driven by general societal trends or specifically the 2030 Agenda and its appeal to the private sector. All these limitations provide avenues for further research.   5 Conclusion MNEs make important contributions to SDG related innovation as measured by their patents. Overall, they have 34% of all patent applications. Of their patent applications, 12.2% are SDG related. This study distinguishes two types of SDG related innovation, labeled as green patents, related to environmental themes, and blue patents, related to improving conditions and meeting unmet sustainable development needs, such as health, nutrition, water and sanitation. MNE’s contribution to the former is on average and to the latter below average. However, the most prominent innovative contribution of MNEs is to the blue Goal 3 “Good Health and Wellbeing”. This is due to the fact that innovation related to this SDG is strongly related to diseases occurring in the developed world. As pharmaceutical patents are frequently surrounded by controversies on medicine accessibility for poor countries, such raises the question as to whether this type of innovation ultimately furthers overall sustainable development. This illustrates one of the paradoxes, inherent in the SDGs. Another paradox is that the achievement of one goal, may hinder the achievement of another, such as pesticides fostering food security or health objectives, but harming ecosystems. SDG relevant innovation of MNEs seems to be related to geographic region and industry group, with the Japan/Korea/Taiwan group standing out. This may be related to their export orientation, the specific corporate group and lending structure, and cultural factors. The industry groups show different levels of absolute and relative SDG related innovation, while there is also considerable spread within the groups. The "Materials" and "Automobiles and Components" industries exhibit innovations related to energy savings and emission reduction. SDG related innovation seems to be largely unrelated to external or institutional sustainability phenomena. No association was found between SDG relevant SOI and the decision to engage in sustainability reporting (frameworks). Global Compact members seem to engage slightly more in blue innovation. SDG relevant innovation is not reflected in the DJSI sustainability rating. It could be a suggestion to include SDG relevant innovation in sustainability rankings, as they are measurable and concrete. For the sample of MNEs publishing a sustainability report there is some association between SDG relevant innovation and external assurance, and, for green innovation, also mention of the SDGs in the report. Even though the associations are weak, the results do indicate that phenomena like the GC and SDG mentioning may not be merely symbolic. The present study advances the understanding of the innovative contribution of MNEs to sustainable development. It also increases the understanding by linking sustainable innovation to externally observable company characteristics, such as industry and regional adherence, and institutional corporate sustainability manifestations, such as Global Compact membership and sustainability reporting. It may also increase the awareness of the value of SDG relevant innovation for sustainability reporting and influence the evolution of reporting frameworks to include SDG relevant innovation.
