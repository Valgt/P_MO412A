                  There are only few studies globally that have documented the linkages between urban green spaces (UGS) and sustainable development goals (SDGs). In Malaysia, there is no existing research evaluating the relationship between UGS and SDGs. In this study, we assessed Malaysians’ perception on the association between UGS and seven selected SDGs, building on existing studies that looked at importance of UGS with regards to biodiversity, health, and wellbeing outcomes in Malaysia. Using an online survey of 645 respondents across Malaysia, we tested two hypotheses: H1) perception of SDGs varies by socio-demographic factors and H2) perception of SDGs is moderated by distance to green spaces. A pre-tested structured online questionnaire was administered using a 5-point Likert scale. The data was then analysed using analysis of variance and ordinary least squares. Results show that there is an overall statistically significant difference (p < 0.001) between the sociodemographic variables and the positive perceptions of seven selected SDGs. Several sociodemographic factors (female, younger age, university education, closer to UGS, physical activities in UGS) had positive and significant relationship between UGS and SDGs perception. However, proximity to UGS did not moderate the effect of demographic factors on the attitude towards the SDGs. As Malaysia is becoming a rapidly urbanized country, we suggest developing small green spaces (e. g. pocket parks) in the vicinity of housing areas so that people will have easy access and perform physical activities for their wellbeing. At the same time these green spaces will ultimately contribute to achieving other SDGs in urban areas.

Handling Editor: Dr Cecil Konijnendijk van den Bosch There are only few studies globally that have documented the linkages between urban green spaces (UGS) and sustainable development goals (SDGs). In Malaysia, there is no existing research evaluating the relationship between UGS and SDGs. In this study, we assessed Malaysians’ perception on the association between UGS and seven selected SDGs, building on existing studies that looked at importance of UGS with regards to biodiversity, health, and wellbeing outcomes in Malaysia. Using an online survey of 645 respondents across Malaysia, we tested two hypotheses: H1) perception of SDGs varies by socio-demographic factors and H2) perception of SDGs is moderated by distance to green spaces. A pre-tested structured online questionnaire was administered using a 5-point Likert scale. The data was then analysed using analysis of variance and ordinary least squares. Results show that there is an overall statistically significant difference (p < 0.001) between the sociodemographic variables and the positive perceptions of seven selected SDGs. Several sociodemographic factors (female, younger age, university education, closer to UGS, physical activities in UGS) had positive and significant relationship between UGS and SDGs perception. However, proximity to UGS did not moderate the effect of demographic factors on the attitude towards the SDGs. As Malaysia is becoming a rapidly urbanized country, we suggest developing small green spaces (e. g. pocket parks) in the vicinity of housing areas so that people will have easy access and perform physical activities for their wellbeing. At the same time these green spaces will ultimately contribute to achieving other SDGs in urban areas.   Keywords Malaysia  Green Spaces  Parks  Sustainability  Sustainable Development Goals  Urban Society  Environment  Social  Economic    1 Introduction Urban green spaces (UGS) are natural and artificial vegetation, and open spaces within the urban environments that are commonly used for recreational and leisure activities (Colding et al., 2020 ). These UGS are usually freely accessible and include urban forests, parks, gardens, mountain trails, and other open areas. Accessible, attractive, and well-managed UGS provide room for socialization, improve quality of urban life and urban economy, and potentially contribute to environmental sustainability, health and health equity (Kruize et al., 2019 ). Well designed, accessible, and well-used UGS (e. g. pocket parks) can have enormous benefit to people who have no access to private green/outdoor spaces (London Sustainable Development Commission, 2020 ). Availability of UGS (e. g. urban and per-urban forests) improve the livelihoods and well-being of urban and per-urban populations (FAO Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2020 ). Researchers (e. g. Karuppannan et al., 2013 ; Rostami et al., 2013 ; Nath et al., 2018 ; Samad et al., 2020 ) have noted that light physical activities and interactions with people in UGS positively affects health and mental well-being and lower the risk of chronic non-communicable diseases. By promoting physical and mental health, UGS is thought to contribute to peoples’ happiness (Kwon et al., 2021 ). Social interactions in UGS may be utilised for facilitating nature-based and cultural activities, and improve social capital and cohesion (Kiani et al., 2014 ; Lee et al., 2015 ; Samad et al., 2020 ). Urban green spaces may contribute towards environmental benefits such as providing ecosystem services including biodiversity conservation and climate regulation. Specifically, UGS may improve bioclimatic conditions of cities, aid in pollution control, have a positive effect on soil and water cycle, prevent excessive heat and natural disasters, and provide rainwater retention and flood control (Jim and Chen, 2006; Haq, 2011 ; Kiani et al., 2014 ; Rostami et al., 2013 ; Karuppannan et al., 2013 ; Kiani et al., 2014 ; Lee et al., 2015 ; Vargas-Hernández et al., 2018 ; Samad et al., 2020 ; Dizdaroğlu, 2022 ). Another key aspect is that UGS may contribute towards economic returns. The opportunities provided by UGS may include providing attractive location for business ventures, development and boosting tourism, thereby boosting the local economy and subsequently generating employment and revenue (Haq, 2011 ; Rostami et al., 2013; Karuppannan et al., 2013 ; Kiani et al., 2014 ; Samad et al., 2020 ). Moreover, UGS may be an education platform towards advancing citizens’ knowledge on environment and improve their perception for creating a resilient environment and community (Varela-Candamio et al., 2018 ; Dizdaroğlu, 2022 ). Urban green spaces can have an immense contribution to the social, environmental, and economic spectrum of sustainable development, which are the foundation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030 (Hyder and Haque, 2022 ). These green spaces play a fundamental role at local level as they provide recreational and bioclimatic regulatory functions and act as a carbon sink, therefore they contribute directly to three SDGs: SDG 11 Sustainable cities and communities, SDG 13 Climate Action and SDG 15 Life on land (Lorenzo-S´aez et al., 2021 ; Nagypál, 2022 ). Research by Azagew and Worku (2020) , Sarre and Davey (2021) , Van Zyl et al. (2021)  and others have reported that UGS have wider implications for achieving many of the SDGs. Well managed UGS can directly and indirectly contribute to 15 of the 17 SDGs (Turner-Skoff and Cavender, 2019 ). Sustainable management and uses of UGS can be a practical and low-cost opportunity to generate multiple benefits across the SDGs (Ghani and Tan, 2020 ). In Malaysia, the benefits/functions of UGS are increasingly recognized by the general public (Aziz, 2012 ; Karuppannan et al., 2013 ; Nath et al., 2018 ). However, urbanisation and population growth have put significant pressure on greenspaces; threatened by degradation, reduction in size and fragmentation in favour of the development of infrastructure, commercial and industrial areas (Aziz, 2012 ; Rostami et al., 2013 ; Karuppannan et al., 2013 ; Colding et al., 2020 ). The Department of Statistics, Malaysia reports that the percentage of urban population increased from 71.91% in 2010–76.61% by the 2019 and is expected to reach 88% by 2050 (Department of Statistics, 2020 ). This has led to rapid urbanisation and land-use changes (i. e. conversion of forest and green spaces to build-up areas) and has significant implications for Malaysia’s natural and urban environment (Aziz, 2012 ). Globally, research on UGS has focused notably on recreation, physical and mental health, and regulating services, and there is very little information on the contribution of UGS to several of the other SDGs (Shackleton, 2021 ). Hanna and Comín (2021)  also reported that most research on relationships between UGS and SDGs focused on goals 11, 13, 15 and 16, and there is very little information on other SDGs. More broadly research on the relationship between nature suggest that access to green space may promote pro-environmental behaviour or increasing human-nature connectedness (Soga and Gaston, 2016; Gaston and Soga, 2020 ). In Malaysia, there is a lack of research on how UGS play an important part in achieving the SDGs. There are some important studies conducted in selected UGS in Malaysia focusing on the linkages between UGS and their impacts on human health and biodiversity conservation (Nor Akmar et al., 2012 ; Karuppannan et al., 2013 ; Aida et al., 2016 ; Nath et al., 2018 ). But none of them have a particular focus on peoples’ perception on the relationship between UGS and the SDGs. In this cross-sectional study, we explored Malaysians’ perception of UGS and the SDGs. We assessed seven SDGs which are strongly connected to UGS including goal 3 (good health and wellbeing), 4 (quality education), 5 (gender equality), 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 13 (combat climate change), 15 (life on land), and 17 (partnership for sustainable development). Peoples’ perception provides essential input for policymakers towards making evidence-based decisions in the management and sustainable conservation of urban green spaces (Bakhtiari et al., 2014; Gashu et al., 2020 ). In our study we were particularly interested in how accessibility/availability of UGS, where distance was used as a proxy for the influence of UGS on residents’ perceptions of SDGs. As local governments are responsible for leading many of the 17 SDGs (Ghani and Tan, 2020 ), this study may provide baseline information on the relationships between UGS and SDGs, and thus authorities can use findings to support and encourage the creation and management of UGS towards achieving Agenda 2030. This study will provide information on the key factors, which authorities may consider for management and uses of UGS, as well as for promoting the protection and development of UGS in rapidly developing Southeast Asia.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Sustainability framework The millennium development goals (MDGs) and SDGs represent the global development agenda adopted by the United Nations (UN) member countries for achieving sustainable development. Although the role of forests towards sustainable development has received little attention in the MDGs, the importance of forests is explicitly highlighted in SDG 15 and that the SDG15 is directly and indirectly related to other 16 SDGs (RECOFTC, 2016; Bukoski et al., 2018; Swamy et al., 2018; Baumgartner, 2019 ). The agenda-2030 with 17 SDGs is a comprehensive measure of sustainable development, and forests, especially UGS might assist to achieve many of these goals. In this study we followed the UN sustainable development goals as the theoretical framework to assess Malaysians’ perception on positive association between UGS and selected seven SDGs. We evaluated only seven SDGs (see above) that we assumed directly related to urban context.  2.2 Study design and setting We adopted a cross-sectional design to assess the perception of Malaysian people of the contribution of UGS to seven selected SDGs. Quantitative data were collected through an online survey. We drafted a structured questionnaire based on our prior research experience and related literature (Cohen et al., 2007 ; Kaźmierczak et al., 2013 ; Rostami et al., 2013 ; Jansson, 2014 ; Kabisch et al., 2017 ; Vargas-Hernández et al., 2018 ; Sturiale and Scuderi, 2019 ; Vidal et al., 2019 ; Arch2O.com, 2020 ; Holgate et al., 2020 ; UNDP, 2020 ). The draft questionnaire was reviewed by four experts and pre-tested with 20 respondents. Experts reported that questions and responses were sufficient to achieve research objectives. However, they recommended re-wording some questions for clarity. Based on their comments and feedback from pre-test, we rephrased and eliminated some questions. The final questionnaire consisted of three sections namely socio-demographic profile of respondents and UGS related information (08 questions) and the perception of the contribution of UGS towards the SDGs (26 questions) (Supplementary Table 1 ). The perception of the positive contribution of UGS to selected SDGs were assessed using a 5-point Likert scale (5 =strongly agree, 4 =agree, 3 =fairly agree, 2 =disagree and 1 =strongly disagree). The questionnaire was prepared in English. Malaysian citizens aged 18 years and above and living in the country during this study period were the target respondents.  2.3 Data collection technique We created an online form using Microsoft Office 365 and a link to the form was shared through social media including WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, and Telegram. Respondents were also asked to assist spread the survey to family, friends, and colleagues thus following a snowball sampling approach. Therefore, population size of this study was unknown, and hence we could not estimate the response rate and sample size prior to data collection. The form was available from September 2020 to February 2021.  2.4 Ethical considerations The ethical review committee of Faculty of Science and Engineering at University of Nottingham Malaysia approved this study (Reference number YEW09092020). Participation in this study was voluntary and anonymous, and respondents could withdraw from the survey at any time. Respondents’ informed consent was obtained electronically through the online form prior to beginning the survey.  2.5 Sample size and power calculation We obtained 645 responses, which was satisfactory at 95% confidence level with a ± 5% margin of error (Krejcie and Morgan, 1970 ). Israel (1992)  suggested a sample size of 400 at a 95% confidence level with a ± 5% precision level. For α = 0.05 and a hypothesized proportion of 0.5, the power of a sample size of 645 is 0.99 (calculated using the SigmaXL statistical tool).  2.6 Statistical analysis We first calculated the reliability of the 26 SDG perception scores (Likert scale values of respondents’ perception) using Cronbach’s α, (α ≥ 0.60) to assess internal consistency. An initial assessment of the distribution of the data and descriptive statistics was then undertaken. The online survey data was analysed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). As a first step, however, we use a factor analysis (FA) to create new variables from our existing 26 SDG variables/questions (Moonsamy and Singh, 2014 ). We then test the following hypothesis:Hypothesis I Perception of SDGs varies by socio-demographic factors.  Hypothesis II: Perception of SDGs is moderated by distance to green spaces.   We test Hypothesis-I  by using a series of ANOVA tests with the seven (07) factors as dependent variables and the socio-demographic factors as independent variables (results are presented in Table 2 ). We test hypothesis II using an OLS estimation technique. Using OLS we estimate the following model:SDG  ij   =  α + β D * G  i   + ζ  j   + ε  i        where SDG is a set of seven factors that we derived from the FA representing perception of SDGs by individual I , D  is a vector of demographic indicators of individual i  and G  is a vector of green space related indicators; ζ  is a vector of control variables; and ε   is the error term. We first ran an OLS specification without the interaction (results in Table 3 ) to establish whether distance to green spaces is an important determinant of perception of SDGs, and then ran the specification with interactions to identify the moderating effect (results in Supplementary Table 3 ). To identify if distance to green spaces moderates the effect of demographic and UGS factors, we coded the distance in this specification as a binary: those between 0 and 1 km of the nearest UGS coded as 1 (39% of the respondents), and those that are beyond 1 km are coded as 0 (61% of the respondents). We coded age as a binary, those under the age of 30 years were coded as 1 (48%), and those above the age of 30 years (52%) were coded as 0. We coded education as a binary, with those with a bachelor or higher (55%) taking a value of 1, and others coded as 0 (45%).   3 Results 3.1 Reliability The reliability of all 26 SDG perception scores (Likert scale values of respondents’ perception) was checked using Cronbach’s α, where α ≥ 0.6 was regarded as sufficient. The alpha coefficient of all 26 SDG perception scores was greater than 0.80, which indicates that the level of internal consistency is acceptable.  3.2 Socio-demographic characteristics of respondents and information on UGS Out of 654 respondents, 50.8% (n = 332) were male and 49.2% (n = 322) were female ( Table 1 ). This indicates that participation of male and female in this study was almost equal. Most of the respondents (48.3%; n = 316) were of the 18 – 30 years age group followed by 30 – 50 years (35.5%; n = 232) and more than 50 years (16.2%; n = 106) groups. Almost similar proportion of respondents reported attaining secondary (44.5%; n = 291) and undergraduate (44.3%; n = 283) as their highest level of education. A small portion of the respondents (12.2%; n = 80) received postgraduate level education. As for occupation, students (36.1%; n = 236) were the dominant group followed by the private sector (22%; n = 144), government staff (14.2%; n = 93), business (12.5%; n = 82) and others (15.1%; n = 99) which consisted of self-employed, housemakers and retirees. Most of the respondents (63.8%; n = 417) lived within two kilometres from parks.  3.3 Frequency and purposes of UGS visit Among respondents, 73.1% (n = 478) reported visiting UGS (Tables 1)  and 28.7% (n = 188) of them reported visiting UGS (e. g. parks, urban forests) just few days in a month, followed by few days in every two weeks (22.8%; n = 149) and few days in every week (21.6%; n = 141). For most of them (27.3%), physical activities (e. g. walking, jogging) were the main purpose of visiting UGS followed by viewing nature (25.0%) and recreation (23.2%) ( Fig. 1 ). While around 11.6% and 7.2% claimed to visit UGS for meeting friends and accompanying children, respectively.  3.4 Factors analysis of SDG Perception To enable refined analysis of our intended outcomes, we use a factor analysis (FA) to create new variables from our existing questions (Moonsamy and Singh, 2014 ). The FA transformed 26 variables in sections relating to the SDGs to seven (07) factors (variables) on the following themes: Health and Well-being (SDG3), Education (SDG4), Gender Equality (SDG5), Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG11), Climate Change Mitigation (SDG13), Life on Land (SDG15), and Partnerships for Sustainable Development (SDG17). We did purposive FA, factoring each subset of questions pertaining to an SDG to one factor. The Bartlett p-value was 0.000 indicating the data is appropriate for FA (Malhotra, 2014). Each of the 7 factors cumulatively explained at least 65% of the variance of the factors they compressed. The summary table for FA is presented in Supplementary Table 2 .  3.5 Overall scores of SDGs against socio-demographic factors As evident from  Table 2 , there is an overall statistically significant difference (p < 0.001) between the sociodemographic variables and the seven selected SDGs perception. Overall, there is a strong observed association between the variables of the two groups (socio-demographic and SDGs perception). Gender had an overall significant effect on the perceived positive contribution of UGS on SDGs, particularly the F-value for health and wellbeing (F=33.24; p < 0.001) and sustainable cities and communities (F=29.02; p < 0.001) were high but the F-value for gender equality (F=10.18; p < 0.001) was somewhat low. The average males’ mean scores (3.76 ± 0.90) were significantly lower compared to the females’ scores (4.06 ± 0.81) across the SDGs perception. Likewise, the age demographics varied significantly across the SDGs perception, with a relatively high F-value on gender equality (F=23.54; p < 0.001) and sustainable cities and communities (F=21.94; p < 0.001). Younger respondents (18–30 years age group (4.05 ± 0.73)) had a significantly higher level of positive perception across the SDGs perception. Relatively high F-values were observed for education attainment and several SDGs including health and wellbeing (F=34.24; p < 0.001), gender equality (F=26.57; p < 0.001), sustainable cities and communities (F=23.71; p < 0.001), climate change mitigation (F=21.10; p < 0.001) and life on land (F=22.76; p < 0.001). Regarding the mean scores, respondents with secondary education (3.68 ± 0.94) had the lowest level of perception, followed by postgraduates (3.84 ± 1.06). Respondents having undergraduate level of education reported relatively high positive levels of perception (4.15 ± 0.66) of the SDGs. Significant differences were observed among the occupation variables and the SDG perception. However, compared to the other sociodemographic groups, relatively lower F-values were observed among the SDGs with regards to differences between occupation categories, with the lowest belonging to education (F=6.60; p < 0.001). Regardless, students (4.14 ± 0.65) and others (4.09 ± 0.83) showed higher overall mean scores compared to the other three occupation demographics consisting of service in private sector (3.78 ± 0.98), business (3.72 ± 0.89), and government staff (3.47 ± 0.96), which showed relatively poor levels of perception across the SDG perception. There were significant differences between SDG perception and distance to the nearest UGS. Respondents living in within 1-km and more than 5-km from the UGS had similar mean scores indicating alike perception on importance of green spaces. However, relatively higher F-values were observed for health and wellbeing (F=13.02; p < 0.001) and partnership for sustainable development (F=12.85; p < 0.001). Frequency of visit to UGS had greater effect on SDG perception especially for sustainable cities and communities with higher F-value (F=17.72; p < 0.001) and life on land (F=11.51; p < 0.001). Those who visited UGS few days in a week and few days in a month had similar perception on SDG perception as overall mean scores of these two groups of respondents were almost similar.  3.6 Socio-demographic and UGS related information that influence Malaysians’ perception on contribution of UGS to selected seven SDGs Results of OLS shown in  Table 3 1  1 In our preliminary specification, we included occupational categories as explanatory variables. However, due to high correlation between age and occupation (r = 0.6052, p < 0.001 ),  driven by a large proportion of the respondents being students, the occupation variable was dropped from the analysis to avoid multicollinearity (Malhotra, 2014).   decompose the previous statistical analysis (Table 2 ), to assess how the variable values affect the relationship between socio-economic factors and relationship between UGS impact on perception of SDGs. The assessment indicate that female respondents perceived a more positive and significant relationship between UGS and seven SDGs perception than the male respondents. However, the effect of age on perceptions of SDGs perception was not very strong. The results also, crucially, indicate a strong positive relationship between educational qualification and attitude towards SDGs. At each higher level of education, compared to those with only primary education, there was a positive and statistically significant effect on the perception of SDGs we studied. Distance to UGS had a strong and statistically significant effect on each of the SDG perception factors. Results indicate that individuals closer to UGS had a more positive perception towards contribution of UGS to SDGs than those further away. Those who visited parks and green spaces for physical activity (exercise) also had a positive attitude towards all seven SDGs. Not so surprisingly, those who visited UGS to view nature had a positive attitude towards health and wellbeing (SDG3). Those who visited UGS to socialise, however, did not agree towards the relationship between UGS and SDGs. When we looked at the interaction between the demographic factors with distance to UGS, we observed that proximity to UGS did not moderate the effect of demographic factors on the attitude towards the SDGs (Supplementary Table 3 ). The results in Supplementary Table 3  are in line with Table 3 .   4 Discussion The findings of this study show that females had an overall higher and positive perception on all seven SDGs compared to males. This is due probably because of Malaysian government policy that gives priority to empowering girls and women, promoting women’s participation in all sectors and the emphasis of gender equality embedded in SDGs and the Malaysia blueprints (Mail, 2019 ). It has also been reported that women attribute a higher value of UGS than men (Braçe et al., 2021 ; Sultana and Selim, 2021 ). Women (e. g. homemakers) may spend more time in neighbourhood UGS, have more connectedness to nature and thus perceive higher importance of UGS. Older and younger respondents (e. g. >50 and 18–30, respectively) showed positive perceptions of the SDG compared to the middle-age group (30−50). Younger respondents may adopt a more active lifestyle and frequently visit parks for physical activity while older participants, as closer to retiring age, may enjoy more free time and regularly visit parks for walking, recreation, and relaxation. Another factor could be disparities in exposure towards information, news, and media platforms (Paul et al., 2020 ). Older, unemployed women, and single men attribute the greatest importance to green spaces (Braçe et al., 2021 ). Respondents that are tertiary educated demonstrated positive perception and higher score across each SDG. Sultana and Selim (2021)  also reported that respondents’ educational background play a significant role on their perception of the importance of UGS. However, the secondary education group (i.e., respondents with secondary, pre-university, and diploma qualification) exhibited poorer levels of perception and, therefore, policy intervention is necessary to expand their understanding and perception of sustainability issues to allow for more nuanced practice. Conversely, Others  had the highest mean scores among the occupation groups. However, since it constitutes three occupation groups of self-employed, homemakers and retirees, it remains unclear if each of these groups had significant effects on the SDGs perception (we did not decompose this analysis further by group due to small sample size). Regardless, students recorded the second-highest score, and this may be due to their exposure to new information from classes, lectures and studying on a day-to-day basis. However, the lower perception of government staff is somewhat worrying as they are one the biggest stakeholders in all sectors, particularly those that manage green spaces and build environments (Samad et al., 2020 ). This indicates avenues for improvement in their understanding of the benefits of UGS and their linkages to the SDGs. Distance to the nearest UGS played a significant role on respondents’ perception. Respondents living in near to UGS perceived comparatively higher score across all SDGs, which may be linked to the impact of access and proximity to nature on having pro-environmental behaviour (Soga and Gaston, 2016; Gaston and Soga, 2020 ). Residents living in adjacent to green spaces use them most and so perceive their importance higher (Lee and Maheswaran, 2010; Douglas et al., 2017; Nath et al., 2018; Paul et al., 2020 ). Studies demonstrated the importance of distance to UGS and reported that residents visit frequently the nearest UGS for different purposes thus put positive values to contribution of these green spaces (Yessoufou et al., 2020 ). Dias et al. (2019)  reported that people frequently use green spaces closer to their home for physical activities and so enjoy the benefits. However, interaction of distance and demographic variables showed no effects on the attitude towards SDGs. Those who visit UGS for physical activity showed more positive perception across all SDGs. Respondents whose purposes of UGS visit was viewing nature, emphasised health and wellbeing outcomes. With regards to frequency of visit, people who visit UGS few days in a month perceived higher score across all SDGs. Sultana and Selim (2021)  also observed a dichotomous response on ecosystems services of UGS in respect to frequency of visitation. Bertram and Rehdanz (2015)  suggested that people who visit UGS a few days in a month are more observant during visit and therefore perceive their values more. Lencastre et al. (2022)  reported that although few people (35.6% of sample) visit UGS every week, even such infrequent, positively contributed to visitors and potential offered the possibility to experience significant human-nature connectedness.  5 Limitations The survey instrument was designed to induce simplicity so that respondents can understand well and respond accordingly. Due to this, and possible direct constructs several responses are geared towards the options of “strongly agree and agree”. This, however, is unlikely to indicate biased results per se, as respondents are likely to be aware of the importance of UGS due to civic consciousness. Next, the respondents were mostly university-level educated and so the results may not represent the perception of the general public of Malaysia. Cultural habits, motives to use UGS, and the level of socioecological awareness of respondents might affect their perception on association between UGS and SDGs. A wider study that tests the wider sociodemographic characteristics of respondents should be able to overcome this limitation. While the cross-sectional nature of the data coupled with the estimation techniques employed in the paper do not present causal relationships. This is a limitation, and studies that are able to use experiments or experiment-like methods are able to provide more nuanced findings using this current work as a stepping point for further analysis. Finally, this study is one of the first studies in Malaysia that linked the functions/benefits of UGS to the achievement of several SDGs. Therefore, this study provides a baseline for future research in Malaysia.  6 Conclusions and implications Malaysia, along with other countries, have adopted agenda 2030 for sustainable development. In this endeavour, urban green spaces can play an important role to achieve several SDGs, which have not been explored in Malaysian context. Malaysians’ perception was significantly influenced by their socio-demographic factors, especially by gender (women), age (younger), education (university), occupation (students) and distance to the nearest UGS (within 1-km). Findings of this study reveal that Malaysian people recognise well the importance of UGS for SDGs. Perceived positive perception of the importance of UGS favours conservation of natural resources can be enhanced through citizens’ participation in the design of regenerative urban green spaces (Lencastre et al., 2022 ). Our findings make important contributions the lack of scholarship on UGS in the Global South, especially Southeast Asia (Lourdes et al., 2021 ), which are undergoing rapid transformations in their urban environments, resulting in the loss of urban green and blue spaces (Lechner et al., 2020 ). Our findings suggest UGS have important role, in not just the direct benefits from the provision of cultural ecosystem services associated with recreation, but also indirectly through influencing broader values which are associated human-nature connectedness and promoting the SDGs. Considering findings from our study in the context of planning and policy in Malaysia, we suggest developing small green spaces (e. g. pocket parks) in the vicinity of housing areas so that people will have easy access and perform physical activities to support their wellbeing, and at the same time these pocket parks assist to achieve several SDGs in urban areas. However, this necessitates the realisation of the importance of UGS by the respective authorities (e. g. National Landscape Department, Ministry of Housing and Local Government of Malaysia, City Councils) and thus taking initiatives towards development and uses of UGS. In a recent statement the Prime Minister of Malaysia outlined directions towards developing and improving country’s urban green infrastructure for improving the quality of life (Bernama, 2022 ). Nonetheless, developing nations are struggling to prioritize UGS over economic development agendas (Hyder and Haque, 2022 ). In Malaysia, the constant decline of UGS indicates that there is a lack of sustainable urban development policies and implementation (Rasli et al., 2019 ). We suggest urban authorities take long-term strategies and actions towards expansion and proper management of UGS, which might assist the government to achieve agenda 2030.
