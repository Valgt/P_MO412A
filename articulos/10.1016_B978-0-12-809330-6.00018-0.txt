               The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Target 6.1 is to “achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all” by 2030. The indicator for this target requires that the drinking water source is compliant with fecal and priority chemical standards, and therefore, treatment of the water source is required. With an increasing global population, decreasing availability of freshwater resources, and increasing pollution of existing water sources from industrial and agricultural activities, the global scale of water in need of treatment is large. In this chapter, we describe the contaminants of interest in drinking water, the challenges faced by both developed and developing countries in providing safe drinking water, and we characterize the scale of treatment needed to achieve the SDG drinking water target.

Luh  J. Bartram  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, United States University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Chapel Hill NC United States    The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Target 6.1 is to “achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all” by 2030. The indicator for this target requires that the drinking water source is compliant with fecal and priority chemical standards, and therefore, treatment of the water source is required. With an increasing global population, decreasing availability of freshwater resources, and increasing pollution of existing water sources from industrial and agricultural activities, the global scale of water in need of treatment is large. In this chapter, we describe the contaminants of interest in drinking water, the challenges faced by both developed and developing countries in providing safe drinking water, and we characterize the scale of treatment needed to achieve the SDG drinking water target.   Keywords Drinking water  Sustainable Development Goals  Treatment  Water quality   1 Introduction The adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 included a target “to achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all” [1] . The emphasis on safe  drinking water is not unique to the SDGs and has appeared in international development targets for the Second and Third United Nations Development Decades [2–4] ; International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade [5,6] ; World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children [7] ; and Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) [8] , and is recognized in the Human Right to Water and Sanitation [9,10] , (see Fig. 18.1  ). During the MDG period, the indicator used to monitor progress toward increasing access to safe drinking water was the “proportion of the population using water from an improved  [emphasis added] source” [8] . This indicator implicitly assumes that water from an improved source is protected from outside contamination [12]  and thus is higher in microbial quality than water from an unimproved source. However, while some studies support this assumption, there is also evidence to show that not all water from improved sources are safe [13,14] . In addition, regardless of whether the drinking water source is safe, water collected from community-level improved water sources (including from piped systems) and stored in households can deteriorate in microbial and/or chemical quality between collection and consumption (e.g., introduction of lead through corrosion of pipes) [15] . To address the fact that use of an improved source does not ensure access to safe water, the indicator to monitor progress toward the SDG water target is the “percentage of the population using safely managed drinking water services” where safely managed drinking water services  is comprised of  an improved source that is accessed on premises, available when needed, and, importantly, compliant with fecal and priority chemical standards [16] . Throughout history, two general approaches have been taken to securing safe water: (1) use of preferred sources, typically groundwater, and (2) treatment of water to improve its chemical, physical, microbiological, and radiological characteristics. The preference for groundwater is based on the lower levels of microbial contamination/presence in groundwater from deep aquifers [17,18] . Groundwater from shallow aquifers or karst aquifers is more readily contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms [17,18] , and, as such, requires treatment to prevent waterborne diseases. Similarly, surface waters, which are open to contamination, require treatment before consumption. Forms of treatment vary from the household level to centralized treatment and distribution with the aim of reducing the health effects of contaminants. For example, in the US, the introduction of chlorination alone in 1908 led to significant decreases in waterborne diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and dysentery [19] . Household water treatment has also been shown to reduce the incidence of diarrheal disease with proper safe storage and handling to prevent recontamination [20] . For chemical contaminants, treatment can also vary. For example, membranes, coagulation/sand filtration, anion exchange, and precipitation can be used to remove arsenic, a heavy metal found particularly in groundwater that can cause severe health effects (e.g., increased risk of cancers) at low concentrations [21] . Household water treatment can also be used to remove arsenic. A study using household sand filters for 2 years to treat raw groundwater for arsenic in Vietnam showed, using hair analysis, that arsenic exposure was lower in people drinking treated water as compared to untreated water [22] . With the increasing global population, and with it a growing population without access to safe water, as well as other factors, such as decreasing availability of freshwater resources and increasing pollution of existing water sources from industrial and agricultural activities, the global scale of water in need of treatment is large. In this chapter, we describe the challenges faced in providing safe drinking water, and we characterize the scale of treatment needed to achieve the SDG drinking water target.  2 Quality Versus Safety Quality and safety are concepts that are often used interchangeably in relation to drinking water, but they have very different meanings. Quality  describes the composition of water and refers to its physical, chemical, biological, and radiological characteristics. Safety compares the quality of water to a specific set of standards for human consumption in order to determine its suitability. For substances that negatively affect the organoleptic properties of water (e.g., taste, smell), these two concepts may overlap. Table 18.1   provides water quality standards for an illustrative range of countries. Due to the fact that changes in water quality can be rapid, testing and comparing water quality results to water quality standards is not sufficient to ensure safety against microbial contaminants. This is in contrast to most chemical contaminants, where it is chronic cumulative exposure that is of health concern for exposure through drinking water. For microbial contaminants, monitoring of water quality must be supplemented with management measures that seek to prevent, and not only react, to hazards that may adversely affect water quality. One systematic risk management approach that combines both management measures and water quality monitoring is Water Safety Plans (WSPs), which is an approach that has  been used in both developing countries (e.g., Bangladesh, South Africa, Uganda [28–30] ) and developed countries (e.g., Australia, Canada, Germany, Slovenia, the UK [31–35] ). The implementation of WSPs has been shown to improve drinking water quality and regulatory compliance [36]  in addition to other benefits, such as improved communication and collaboration between stakeholders and asset management [37,38] . The Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality  defines safe drinking water as water that “…does not represent any significant risk to health over a lifetime of consumption…” [27] . The definition of quality, on the other hand, varies and may be determined by societal demands that include nonhealth-related factors. Table 18.1  presents examples of water quality standards. Thus, in this chapter, we focus on safety and only the water quality parameters that are relevant to safety. The word “potable” is not considered in this chapter, as it is used in the literature to mean both “safe” and/or “intended for human consumption” and is therefore a less useful term for our purposes.  3 Contaminants of Concern Three general types of contaminants can be found in drinking water: chemical, biological, and radioactive. We briefly describe each type below, with the exposure routes of these contaminants summarized in Section 4 . 3.1 Chemical Contaminants The World Health Organization (WHO) has established guideline values for chemical contaminants in the Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality [27] . Classification of chemical contaminants according to the source-categories described in the following is useful because the source-categories determine optimal monitoring approaches and options for prevention and remediation. Naturally occurring inorganic chemical contaminants are found in rocks and soil through which water flows, and include arsenic, chromium, and selenium [27] . Sources of naturally occurring organic chemical contaminants are vegetation and algae in the water, for example, microcystin-LR, which is produced by cyanobacteria (i.e., blue–green algae) [27] . Anthropogenic chemical contaminants can be classified into four main sources: industry, agriculture, water treatment, and households. Industrial activities, such as mining and chemical and fuel storage, are a source of chemical contaminants when materials and products containing the chemicals are stored, discharged, or disposed of in a manner that leads to drinking  water contamination. Examples of chemical contaminants resulting from industrial sources are trichloroethylene (TCE), and tetrachloroethylene (PCE), both of which are used in dry cleaning and as industrial solvents, and benzene, which is a gasoline additive [27] . Contamination from agricultural activities occurs from activities such as the application of fertilizer and pesticides to crops, which enter drinking water through rainfall runoff, or point-source pollution due to inappropriate cleaning of equipment and disposal of products. Pesticides include herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides, and examples of pesticides are atrazine and carbofuran [27] . While water treatment and distribution are designed to ensure that the quality of a water meets standards for human consumption, the processes can inadvertently create chemical contaminants through the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) (e.g., N -nitrosodimethylamine), the corrosion of lead and copper pipes, and the leaching of chemicals from materials in contact with the water (e.g., vinyl chloride monomer) [27] . Finally, households are considered a source of chemical contamination, as household waste can contain heavy metals (e.g., zinc from household activities) or pharmaceutical products (e.g., carbamazepine) [39–41] .  3.2 Biological Contaminants Biological contaminants of health concern in drinking water primarily result from exposure to human and animal excreta, which contain bacteria, viruses, protozoan cysts, and helminths that are pathogenic to humans (e.g., Campylobacter jejuni , rotavirus, Cryptosporidium parvum , Schistosoma  spp.), and from agents that multiply in water under suitable conditions. Multiplication of these pathogens (e.g., Legionella  spp., Mycobacterium avium  complex) throughout the drinking water system is becoming of increasing concern with the expansion of complex piped water systems within buildings [42,43] . While many microorganisms can infect a wide variety of hosts, some may have host specificity. Given that there are pathogens with strict human host specificity, exposure to excreta from humans may pose a greater risk to humans than exposure to excreta from other host species, such as cattle or pigs [44] . However, there have been cases where contamination of waters with animal excreta has resulted in waterborne disease, for example, the contamination of water by cattle manure resulted in an outbreak of Escherichia coli  O157 in Swaziland [45] .   3.3 Radioactive Contaminants Radioactive contaminants in drinking water arise from anthropogenic and naturally occurring sources. Anthropogenic sources of radioactive substances, such as medical diagnostic activities, are usually controlled so that waste is disposed of in an appropriate manner to avoid contamination of drinking water [27] . Naturally occurring sources of radioactive contaminants (e.g., radium, thorium) occur through the dissolution of radioactive substances from rocks and soil to water [27] . Ingestion of radioactive contaminants through drinking water typically accounts for a minor proportion of total radiation received from all sources [27] . In general, the concentration of radioactive contaminants in drinking water is low and not a major global concern, with the exceptions of uranium and radium, and therefore, radioactive contaminants are not considered beyond this section of the chapter. It should be noted that while uranium has been found in drinking water in various countries ranging from <0.1 μg/L up to 700 μg/L, the primary health effect of concern is its chemical toxicity, specifically nephritis, and not radiological toxicity [46] . Due to the fact that the chemical toxicity of uranium is much higher than its radiological concern, the provisional guidelines value of 30 μg/L provided by the WHO for uranium in drinking water is determined by its chemical toxicity [27,46] . Some drinking water sources may contain radon, a radioactive gas that is soluble in water. Concentrations of radon are generally higher in groundwater from wells and boreholes and lower in surface waters [27] . Turning on the shower or a tap may release radon into the air, although other sources of radon in indoor air exist, such as the soil and building materials. Exposure to radon has been shown to occur primarily through inhalation, rather than ingestion, and thus, guidance levels for radon in drinking water are usually not necessary [27] .   4 Exposure Through Drinking Water Understanding exposure is fundamental to determining the desired quality of water and the corresponding degree of treatment required. For chemical contaminants, it is generally chronic exposure, as opposed to acute exposure, that determines health risk, and therefore, periodic measurements of water quality are appropriate. In contrast, it is acute exposure to biological contaminants that typically causes disease. As short-term microbial exposure can lead to adverse health effects, there is no water sampling and testing  regime that can guarantee that the drinking water is safe from microbial contaminants. Thus, an effective management approach would be to combine monitoring of hazards with continuous monitoring of the control measures that are critical to preventing contamination. There are a limited number of chemical contaminants for which there is evidence that suggests drinking water is a significant source of exposure at concentrations of health concern. The WHO provides guideline values for these chemicals, depending on the type of chemical contaminant. For “non-threshold chemicals,” which are largely genotoxic carcinogens, guideline values are calculated as the concentrations in drinking water that would result in an estimated upper-bound excess lifetime cancer risk of 10−5 [27] . For “threshold chemicals,” which are the majority of chemicals, the guideline value is determined based on its tolerable daily intake, which is derived using a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL). The NOAEL is determined using a variety of approaches depending on data availability, although the preference is to use long-term studies of ingestion of drinking water [27] . While no globally representative data are available, the principal chemical contaminants of concern, in decreasing order based on population exposure, are likely to be fluoride and arsenic. Additional chemicals of concern with established WHO guideline values include selenium and chromium, among others. Both fluoride and arsenic occur naturally in groundwater and are common in various parts of the world. Arsenic, known to cause cancer after exposure through drinking water and also known to have other adverse health effects [21,47] , is prevalent in many regions in the world, particularly in Bangladesh and also West Bengal, Vietnam, and China [22] . Daily consumption of fluoride above 14 mg per day leads to skeletal fluorosis and an increased risk of bone fractures [48] . Fluoride is problematic in the East African Rift Valley from the Jordan Valley through Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, and the United Republic of Tanzania as a result of volcanic rocks, and also from Iraq and Iran through Syria and Turkey to the Mediterranean region due to sediments of marine origin [49] . In affected areas, water tends to be the principal source of exposure to both fluoride and arsenic. Lead is introduced into drinking water as a result of corrosion of lead pipes [50,51]  and can cause neurological, renal, and hematological problems [51,52] . However, lead exposure via ingestion of drinking water is typically low when compared to lead exposure via ingestion of lead-contaminated dust (e.g., from paint containing lead) and via inhalation  of lead particles (e.g., generated by burning materials containing lead, present in fumes from gasoline containing lead additives) [53,54] . Other important routes of exposure to lead are ingestion of contaminated food and soil [53,54] . A large body of evidence exists that demonstrates that consumption of water from contaminated community sources, which include improved sources such as hand pumps and protected springs, and contaminated distribution systems may be a route of exposure for biological contaminants associated with a substantive disease burden. Both the point of water collection/receipt and household stored water need to be considered, as water quality deteriorates due to contamination during its collection, transportation, and storage [13–15] . Studies that assess the presence of fecal contamination in drinking water generally focus on E. coli  or thermotolerant coliforms (TTC), which serve as indicators of fecal contamination. While these two indicators are useful in identifying populations that have been exposed to pathogens, the absence of either do not necessarily indicate an absence of fecal contamination. For example, E. coli  is much more susceptible to free chlorine as compared to protozoan cysts, and therefore, chlorinated waters in which E. coli  is absent may still contain infective protozoan cysts. As such, the use of only E. coli  or TTC does not provide a reliable estimate of risk. Instead, alternative methods, such as quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) [55,56] , should be used to determine treatment requirements.  5 Treatment Location Drinking water treatment can occur at one or more of three locations: centralized prior to reticulated distribution, centralized at the point of collection (i.e., community sources), and in households [i.e., point of entry (PoE), point of use (PoU)/household water treatment and safe storage (HWTS)]. The treatment location is important, depending on the hazard of concern and its management. For example, for chemical contaminants (e.g., lead from corrosion of lead pipes, vinyl chloride monomer from unplasticized polyvinyl chloride used in drinking water pipes) and biological contaminants (e.g., Legionella  spp. that colonize building plumbing) that are introduced during transportation, distribution, and storage, prevention, and/or household water treatment would be needed. Depending on the location of treatment, the design, operation, and management of the treatment technique/process varies.  5.1 Centralized Treatment Prior to Reticulated Distribution For centralized treatment prior to reticulated distribution, experience has shown that large, centralized utility water supplies can successfully apply treatment to render water safe. The success of these large utilities is in part due to greater resources in terms of well-engineered, constructed facilities, financial resources, as well as access to technical expertise for continuous professional management. However, availability of resources alone does not necessarily ensure the production of safe water, with data showing that drinking water quality improves with active management. As an example, analysis of health and water quality data from municipal water utilities in Iceland showed that when WSPs, a systematic preventive management and risk assessment approach, were implemented, a significant decrease in incidence of clinical cases of diarrhea, an improvement in water quality as measured by heterotrophic plate counts, and a significant decrease in regulatory noncompliance were observed [36] . While no studies are available in the literature on the effect of WSP implementation on chemical contaminants, WSPs also have the potential to assist water providers in better controlling for chemical contaminants. Community-managed systems also have centralized treatment prior to reticulated distribution; however, they differ from large utilities in the operating and management challenges they face. Specifically, the WHO noted that “the precise definition of a ‘community water supply’ will vary. While a definition based on population size or the type of supply may be appropriate under many conditions, it is often administration and management that set community supplies apart, and this is especially true in developing countries. The increased involvement of ordinary, often untrained and sometimes unpaid, community members in the administration and operation of water-supply systems is characteristic of small communities; this provides a ready distinction between community water supplies and the supply systems of major towns and cities.” [57] . As such, community-managed systems may have problems managing complex and failure-sensitive treatment systems, and waterborne outbreaks can result (e.g., Walkerton, Canada). The community-managed systems require professional management and are often associated with certification schemes, as safety is a key consideration for these types of business models. One example of a business model for community-managed systems is the circuit rider model. The circuit rider model allows community-managed systems to contract with an association that provides technical expertise, assistance, and training in the supply,  treatment, and distribution of drinking water for community-managed systems. One technical advisor visits several communities on a frequent basis, and thus, communities have access to technical expertise without incurring the expense of having a full-time expert on staff.  5.2 Centralized Treatment at the Point of Collection Centralized treatment at the point of collection refers to community sources, such as water kiosks where water can come from a spring to piped network or from a borehole and hand pump. These are generally found in peri-urban areas for both developing and developed countries, although with the SDG requirement for on-premises water sources and ongoing development favoring higher levels of service, the prevalence of community sources is likely to decline. Due to the relatively low volumes of water produced at community sources, advanced treatment processes such as reverse osmosis can be applied. An additional example would be the use of ultrafiltration followed by UV disinfection. However, it must be noted that recontamination of the water can occur after collection during the transportation and storage process. Community sources often require professional management and certification schemes.  5.3 Packaged Water One specialized case of centralized treatment is that of packaged, including bottled and sachet, water. Consumption of packaged water has grown in the last decade, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, and is used in urban, rural, and peri-urban areas. As an example, 18% of households in Ghana used packaged water as their primary source of water in 2011 [58] , with one study showing that in a peri-urban area of Accra, this proportion increased to 47% [59] . In theory, professional management and governance should ensure that packaged water meets specific certification; however, this is not always achieved. With the rapid increase in use of packaged water, effective regulation does not always occur in many low- and middle-income countries, resulting in outbreaks of cholera [60]  and other waterborne diseases. While studies have shown that packaged water in West African countries may contain microbial, chemical, and radioactive contamination [60–67] , a recent study in Freetown, Sierra Leone [68]  showed that these risks must be weighed against alternative water sources and that packaged water may be the least unsafe option compared to stored household water for consumption. Microfranchising has been used as a business model  for the packaging and selling of water where startup costs are significantly lower than those associated with a traditional franchise model, thereby making it affordable for individuals of low income, but the benefits of brand recognition and marketing are available.  5.4 Household Water Treatment Management of household water treatment (i.e., PoE, PoU/HWTS) is at the individual or household level. PoE devices can be plumbed directly into the sink faucet or tap, where the device is installed in the main water pipe and all water used in the household undergoes treatment (i.e., device installed at PoE) [69] . Examples of PoE devices include water softeners and reverse osmosis systems. PoU devices, also referred to as HWTS, generally refer to free-standing devices or treatment techniques that are not plumbed in and that are widely used in both developed and developing countries. Many HWTS devices are countertop, although some devices are portable, allowing them to be used in various settings, such as disaster relief when drinking water infrastructure has been compromised, for outdoor camping and hiking, and in areas where households must collect and carry water back to their homes. Examples of HWTS practices would be boiling, chlorination, and filtration, while examples of HWTS devices would be ceramic pot filters and activated carbon filters, including filters that are installed on the tap(s) of interest [69–71] . The success of HWTS devices in preventing disease is dependent on various factors, such as the efficacy of the treatment method to remove chemicals or inactivate pathogens, user behavior in terms of consistent and correct use, and also effective governance in ensuring product certification. Proper household storage, including use of a closed or narrow-necked container to prevent recontamination, is essential to the success of HWTS [69–71] . Similar to PoE treatment, HWTS does not increase access to safe water and focuses only on improving water quality. It should be noted that not all HWTS devices are designed to remove/inactivate microorganisms and provide microbially safe water. Instead, these devices are intended to either provide incremental improvement or address nonmicrobial concerns (e.g., taste).   6 Treatment Options Numerous sources describe the different options available for treating drinking water [18,72] . Here we provide a brief summary of the treatment  processes used for addressing biological and chemical contaminants, regardless of whether they are applied to centralized or household systems. For biological contaminants, treatment efficacy in reducing microbes of concern is, in broad terms, achieved by the physical removal of microbes from water and/or their inactivation, where the latter refers to rendering the microbes unable to reproduce. It is common to use a multiple barrier approach in the form of a sequence of processes to provide higher security against failure [18,72–74] . Physical removal of microbes from water is performed through processes such as sedimentation and filtration. As microbial size is an important parameter for successful removal, the order of decreasing difficulty for removal is typically viruses > bacteria > protozoa > helminthes [73] . Helminthes are easily removed through gravity settling and/or filtration. During the sedimentation process, particles settle out due to gravity, with larger particles settling out more efficiently than smaller particles. Prior to sedimentation, water can also undergo coagulation and flocculation to promote the association of microbes into larger particles so that they can be physically removed. Filtration relies on a physical barrier to remove microbes and particles. Types of filtration vary widely and include granular media, ceramic, and membrane filters [73] . One filtration technique that relies on both physical and biological processes for microbial removal is slow sand filtration, where removal occurs in the top layer, the schmutzdecke, which consists of a biofilm of microorganisms including bacteria, protozoa, and fungi, and also throughout the filter bed [18,74] . For microbes that are small enough to pass through sedimentation and filtration, chemical or UV treatment is used to inactivate these microorganisms. Common chemical disinfectants include chlorine, ozone, and chlorine dioxide, all of which react with and oxidize the microorganism in order to prevent their reproduction. UV disinfection uses UV light to destroy or disrupt the DNA of microorganisms, thus preventing them from replicating. In developing regions, UV disinfection can be in the form of solar disinfection where bottles of water are exposed to sunlight by placing them on rooftops. Though not a part of the so-called “primary disinfection,” which refers to the use of disinfectant to inactivate microorganisms present in the source water, “residual disinfection” is also used to ensure the microbiological quality of drinking water [18] . Residual disinfection refers to the addition of disinfectant in the already treated water so that microorganism regrowth does not occur and so that any microorganisms that enter the water after it has already been treated are also inactivated before consumption. One  of the reasons why free chlorine is a preferred disinfectant for primary disinfection is because it carries a residual, while other chemical disinfectants, such as ozone and chlorine dioxide, and UV disinfection, do not. In the cases where a residual disinfectant is desired, free chlorine or monochloramine is usually added at the end of the water treatment process. Removal of chemical contaminants is achieved through various processes, depending on the contaminant, its concentration in water and the target concentration to be achieved, and water quality characteristics, among other factors [74] . Table 18.2   lists examples of treatment processes and corresponding chemical contaminants addressed. Processes can range from chemical processes that transform the contaminant such as oxidation to physical processes that remove the contaminant such as membrane treatment. Chemical processes target either contaminant modification to make it more easily removed in a subsequent step (e.g., Fe2+  to Fe3+ , where the latter is more easily precipitated) or mineralization. In some cases, however, by-products may be created that are of health concern; for example, NO2 −  can be formed when attempting to mineralize NO3 −  to N2  and water. To control for DBPs, which are produced during chemical disinfection, in addition to changing process conditions (e.g., changing the pH which may affect the DBP concentrations formed) and removing DBPs after their formation (e.g., via air stripping), an additional strategy is to remove DBP precursors prior to disinfection via, for example, enhanced coagulation. For chemical contaminants, such as lead and copper that are introduced into drinking water as a result of corroding pipes, corrosion control is needed. Commonly used methods to control corrosion include pH adjustment, increasing the alkalinity or hardness, or adding corrosion inhibitors (e.g., polyphosphates, silicates, and orthophosphates) [27] .  7 Scale of Challenge to Reach Sustainable Development Goal Water Target In the SDG era, the indicator used to assess progress toward the SDG water target now requires compliance with fecal and priority chemical (e.g., arsenic, fluoride) standards [16] . Globally, the main contaminants of concern are fecal contamination and in certain countries, arsenic and fluoride. E. coli  is considered the most reliable indicator of fecal contamination, with WHO guidelines of no detectable E. coli  in a 100 mL sample [27] . As water quality data was not available, water quality was not included in the indicators of previous international water targets, nor was it monitored. As such, there  is little data available to assess the current status of the global population with access to water that meets fecal and priority chemical standards. Using water quality data collected by the WHO and UNICEF from five countries (Ethiopia, Jordan, Nicaragua, Nigeria, and Tajikistan), Onda et al. [76]  estimated that in 2010, 1.8 billion people (28% of the global population) used unsafe water, where “unsafe” water was that which tested positive for TTC or had greater than two sanitary risks on the sanitary risk inspection. Of these 1.8 billion people, 1.2 billion people (18% of the global population) used an improved water source that had presence of TTC or significant sanitary risks. Assuming that the same percentage (28%) of the global population will not have access to safe water free from fecal contamination and sanitary risk, and using the 2030 global population estimate at constant fertility of 8.7 billion people [77] , approximately 2.4 billion people would not have access to safe water in 2030. Given that the Onda et al. study looked at national estimates without further breakdowns such as differentiating between rural and urban regions, groundwater versus surface water, or utility-managed versus community-managed versus household-managed sources, future estimates for 2030 at a subnational level are not provided in this chapter. However, it is likely that the majority of this 2.4 billion people will be located in rural areas. In 2015, access to improved water sources was 85% for the global rural population, which was lower than 96% for the global urban population [78] . These percentages were estimated using the MDG indicator for access to improved water sources, which only required access to the improved water source to be at the community level. With the SDG indicator now requiring that improved drinking water must be delivered on premises, this reflects the changed approach that coverage must be at the household rather than community level. Accordingly, both urban and rural populations with access to improved sources will decrease, but more so in rural areas where community sources are more prevalent [79] . Countries will therefore need to allocate resources to not only ensure that water quality meets fecal and priority chemical standards, but also to focus on increasing access from community to household level. While it is not possible to estimate subnational breakdowns (e.g., rural versus urban) for the proportion of the population with access to safe water, we can examine country clusters to identify groupings that will have the greatest difficulty in meeting the SDG target. Regional and income groupings are often used when making comparisons; however, this is not always the logical choice, as some countries are vastly different. For example, while Japan and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are both located in  Eastern Asia, they are vastly different in most other respects. Therefore, instead of using regional or income groupings, we use the five country clusters developed by Onda et al. [80] , where countries are grouped based on similarities across nine water- and sanitation-related indicators. These five clusters shown in Table 18.3   include 156 countries, or 6.75 billion people.  For each of the five clusters, the proportion of the population without access to improved sources is listed in Table 18.3 . Assuming that these percentages stay constant during the SDG era (although as mentioned previously, these percentages will likely decrease with the additional SDG requirements for safe water), the countries in Cluster 5 will face the greatest challenge to achieving safe water in 2030. Cluster 1 consists of developed and recently industrialized countries (e.g., Canada, Germany, Japan) that are characterized by high per capita GDP and low levels of inequality as given by the Gini index. These countries have near-universal access to improved water (at 99.7% of the cluster population) and of the four components of the SDG indicator: (1) improved drinking water facility, (2) available when needed, (3) located on premises, and (4) compliant with fecal and priority chemical standards, the challenge for these countries will likely be ensuring water quality compliance, as the other three factors have mostly been met. In these countries, outbreaks of waterborne disease may still occur occasionally, and one approach to address this problem is to use a preventive risk management approach, such as WSPs and sanitation inspections. WSPs can also be used to plan for the possibility of chemical spills in drinking water sources by identifying potential hazards,  conducting risk assessments, and employing control measures to ensure that the effect on the operation of drinking water systems is minimal. In addition, there is also a need to ensure proper management of small community-managed systems, as past examples have shown that waterborne outbreaks can occur when improperly managed (e.g., Walkerton, Canada E. coli  O157 and Campylobacter  outbreak in 2000; North Battleford, Canada cryptosporidium outbreak in 2001). Cluster 2 countries are characterized by high urbanization and high, though not universal, access to water (96.6% of the cluster population). Example countries in this cluster include Russia, Argentina, and Iran. Similar to the countries in cluster 1, the main focus of cluster 2 countries will be on water treatment to ensure compliance with fecal and priority chemical standards. One challenge in these countries is the existence of small residual populations that continue to use community sources (centralized treatment at the point of collection); for these populations, there will be a need to move toward household-level access. Cluster 3 countries are mainly from Eastern Europe and the Middle East, with some Latin American and Asian countries (e.g., Albania, Lebanon, Costa Rica). These countries are middle income, with ∼50% urbanization, and generally have the lowest renewable freshwater resources per capita. Cluster 4 consists of countries from Latin America and South Africa, with some Asian countries (e.g., Honduras, South Africa, Philippines). The GDP per capita, urbanization, and expected years of education are similar to those countries from cluster 3; however, the cluster 4 countries have a higher income inequality and receive less official development assistance per capita. Both cluster 3 and 4 countries will have the challenge of continuing to extend services to the unserved while ensuring water is treated to meet water quality standards. With ∼50% urbanization, there will need to be a balance between focusing on upgrading services in urban areas to meet SDG requirements (and which may seem the easier task to achieve) versus installing new water services in rural areas where there may be a lack of infrastructure, management, funds, and technical expertise in place to sustain services. Cluster 5 is mainly composed of countries from Sub-Saharan Africa and South/Southeast Asian countries, plus Haiti (e.g., Mozambique, Pakistan, Cambodia). These countries have the lowest per capita GDP, lowest years of expected education, and lowest urbanization. The challenge for these countries will be in all four components of the SDG indicator, as they will need to work on increasing on premises household level access as well as ensuring water quality and availability. For areas where populations do not have access to even an  improved source, the focus would be on providing an improved source before addressing issues of availability (i.e., available when needed).  Conclusions: Present, Emerging, and Future Challenges Monitoring water quality remains a challenge, as the long-term goal is for countries to have independent surveillance and regulation. Currently, water quality data is not available for all countries. Depending on the country, for example, countries that are high income as classified by the World Bank, water quality data may be collected by regulatory agencies. However, even for the most developed nations, data on all supply types that provide a full population overview are typically not available, particularly for small/private systems, which are not monitored. The challenge will be for all low- and middle-income countries to establish and further develop drinking water regulatory agencies tasked with collecting data on water quality, availability, and accessibility, among other parameters. For utility- and community-managed systems, current water treatment operations focus on steady state performance. However, modeling suggests that a short-term deterioration in water quality can negate the benefits of long periods of safety. This suggests that instead of focusing on steady state, assessments should focus on failure mode analysis. One such analysis is QMRA, which has been used for various purposes, such as the determination of health-based targets, the evaluation of alternative treatment strategies, and to determine situations where the risk of exposure may be increased [55] . One difficulty in assessing progress toward the SDG target is reporting on vulnerable groups, such as nomadic people and people living with HIV and AIDS (PLHA). These groups are often difficult to capture in standard national surveys, and they possess special needs. In the case of nomadic groups and PLHA, PoU treatment may be the best option. In the case of nomadic groups, they may roam and temporarily settle in areas without access to improved water, and PoU treatment provides a solution to treating their drinking water. While PLHA may live in areas with centralized water treatment prior to reticulated distribution, they may have compromised immune systems that may require that an additional step of PoU treatment be applied prior to water consumption to ensure that contaminants introduced to the water in the distribution system are removed. During the SDG era, an additional challenge will be the provision of safe drinking water in response to emergencies and disasters. Climate-related  events, such as floods and droughts, are projected to increase in certain areas of the world, and building climate-resilient water systems is a necessity. In addition to increasing resilience, there is also a need to increase disaster response capacity, as the result of emergencies and disasters is often degradation in water quality, a disruption in treatment, and/or a complete loss of access to water. For example, during flooding in June and July 2007, the Mythe drinking water treatment plant in the UK was inundated with floodwater and shut down for 17 days. Approximately 140,000 households were affected, and 50 million liters of bottled water were distributed [81] . Finally, the SDG target is not only confined to households, but also extends to institutional settings, such as schools and healthcare facilities. Both of these settings have large buildings with their own challenges. Healthcare facilities face unique challenges in that their populations are already vulnerable, and there are multiple uses for water in these settings. For example, nosocomial infections from microorganisms that grow in pipes are a concern. While limited data is available on drinking water access in schools and healthcare facilities, additional data and monitoring is required [82–84] .
