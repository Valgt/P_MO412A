               This entry examines United Nations initiatives on sustainable development with regard to education, particularly addressing possible implications for curriculum and curriculum theory. The United Nations' Agenda 2030, including the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, is presented and a deliberative notion of democracy and curriculum practices adopted, with an emphasis on context, also addressing the democratic impasse involved. The global education policy of the United Nations' Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) is examined, identifying vital issues for curriculum theory. The conception of the common good is suggested to be included in a curriculum theory with the aim to critically explore curriculum processes involved.

Keywords Agenda 2030  Common good  Context  Critical cosmopolitanism  Curriculum  Deliberation  Democracy  Democratic iterations  Immanent critique  Sustainable development  Sustainable development goals (SDGs)   Introduction The United Nations (UN) initiatives on sustainable development have gained momentum in a world distinguished by climate crisis, ecological crisis, and global injustices. In the following, these initiatives are addressed with particular attention to the impact on curriculum. The scope is theoretical, identifying and discussing some vital issues for curriculum theory, that should be considered. I first give a short presentation of UN's Agenda 2030, including the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, followed by reflections on the key concepts of curriculum and democracy. A major contradiction within the history of the UN sustainable development initiatives is pointed out that consists of promises that persistently have been followed by the lack of sufficient action, also reflected in the so-called democratic impasse of sustainable development. Critical curriculum studies are called for, exploring both hegemonic imaginaries involved and the significance of context. A multi-level approach to curriculum processes is suggested and exemplified by an account that combines Basil Bernstein's conception of recontextualization with Seyla Benhabib's critical cosmopolitanism, conceiving the recontextualizations of universal norms as democratic iterations. Finally, the conception of the common good is considered as a critical premise within a curriculum theory oriented toward studies of the UN's Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals. Decisive is here the suggestion that the common good, in the SDGs addressed on a general level, also involves recontextualizations expressed in particular curriculum practices, on which hegemonic imaginaries continuously have an impact.  Agenda 2030 and the UN's sustainable development goals On September 25, 2015, the United Nations General Assembly, through the Resolution 70/1 Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development  (United Nations, 2015 ), adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The notion of SDGs, also referred to as the “Global Goals” (French and Kotzé, 2018 ), was first proposed at the 2012 UN Conference on Sustainable Development (the “Rio +20 Summit”), to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which were launched in 2001 and expired in 2015. Through intergovernmental negotiations and open-ended dialogs with civil society including various groups, the draft featuring 17 goals and encompassing 169 targets and subsequent indicators was presented. Unlike the MDGs that were particularly oriented toward developing countries, the SDGs are universally applicable, including all nations globally. The goals are framed by the concept of sustainable development , which, within United Nations, has a history going back to the 1980s and was famously introduced as a key concept by the World Commission on Environment and Development (appointed by United Nations General Assembly in 1983) in the report Our Common Future  in 1987. The report states that sustainable development “meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987 ). With the concept of sustainable development, the United Nations brought together a long-term engagement strategy for social development and elimination of poverty with the acknowledgment of ecological crisis, including human-induced climate change. In a global call to action the commission states:The issues we have raised in this report are inevitably of far reaching [sic ] importance to the quality of life on earth—indeed to life itself. We have tried to show how human survival and well-being could depend on success in elevating sustainable development to a global ethic. In doing so, we have called for such major efforts as greater willingness and cooperation to combat international poverty, to maintain peace and enhance security world-wide, and to manage the global commons. World Commission on Environment and Development (1987) .   In 1992, Our Common Future  was followed by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro. From here emerged the UN conventions on biodiversity (United Nations, 1992a ), climate change (United Nations, 1992b ), desertification (United Nations, 1992c ), the Rio Declaration (United Nations, 1992d ), and Agenda 21 (United Nations, 1992e ), a global action plan for the 21st century. With Agenda 2030 and the SDGs, adopted by UN General Assembly more than twenty years later (United Nations, 2015 ), sustainable development has now been granted an unprecedented status and role as the decisive strategy to guide future strategies and actions. While the 17 Sustainable Development Goals definitely constitute the backbone of Agenda 2030, other elements are included as well that concern financing, partnerships, technology facilitation, monitoring, reporting, and evaluation. In Rio in 1992, education was already explicitly addressed in Chapter 36 of Agenda 21. Here, it is stated that education is “linked to virtually all areas in Agenda 21” (United Nations, 1992e ). Chapter 36 even addresses public awareness and training and calls for the reorienting of education toward sustainable development. UNESCO was appointed as responsible for this educational engagement and monitored the UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) (2005–2014) as a major achievement. The significance and integration of education is restated in Agenda 2030 with quality education addressed as SDG 4, both conceived of as an aim in itself, and a means to promote other aims.  Promises and insufficient action The UN resolution Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development  (United Nations, 2015 ) concludes that significant progress has been made in meeting several of the development challenges continuously addressed by the United Nations. Hundreds of millions of people have emerged from extreme poverty, global access to education has increased, and information and communication technology has been spread. However, the resolution makes equally clear that major threats to life are extended, and in vital areas, the situation has deteriorated distinguishably due to rising social and economic inequalities within and between countries, natural resource depletion and environmental degradation, climate change, putting the survival of societies and the biological support systems of the planet at risk. More severe and disturbing when it comes to the history of this initiative, is the fact that in the early 1990s, social inequalities, climate change, and ecological crisis were addressed as pivotal, urgent concerns in United Nations conventions and declarations and subsequent calls for action. Almost 40 years later, the calls for action are even more urgent, particularly with regard to the ecological and climate crisis. The contradiction between promises and insufficient action appears to be a main flaw in the history of the policy of sustainable development, jeopardizing the legitimacy of the initiative itself. As far as education is a part of this story, the stated contradiction also has bearings on the global education policy of education for sustainable development.  Curriculum and the nation–state Curriculum as a key concept in this entry is an elusive concept, partly due to the broadness of the curriculum field that encompasses student experiences on learning, teacher practices, written documents, and even ideological imaginaries with bearings on education. Moreover, within the context of an international encyclopedia, it is not without problems to refer to a concept emerging from Anglo-American traditions with an emphasis on curriculum-making in local contexts, reflecting school systems that differ considerably from structures and practices in other countries. Thoroughly documented and well explored are, for instance, similarities and differences between this curriculum tradition and the North European didactic tradition in which teachers have been licensed to interpret an open national curriculum while fulfilling the societal mandate of Bildung (“formation”; “edification”) (Hopmann and Riquarts, 2000 ; Künzli, 2000 ; Westbury, 2000 ). “Curriculum is the heart of education,” Null (2011 , p. 1) concludes, pointing at how curriculum expresses what should be taught, combining thought, action, and purpose. The emphasis on subject matter as a defining aspect of curriculum is summed up in the question coined by Spencer (1861) : What knowledge is of most worth? Michael Apple, drawing attention to political and ideological aspects, rephrases the question as: Whose knowledge is of most worth? (Apple, 2004 , p. xix). In the renewal of the German didactic tradition, in the 1980s, Wolfgang Klafki placed current, societal key challenges in the crucial content position of the didactic triangle (the other two apexes constituted by the students and the teacher), including concerns for environment, peace, and global justice (account in English, see Klafki, 1998 ). Klafki exemplifies how global issues have been introduced to curriculum theory, challenging the impression of the general national framing of curriculum within the Westphalian order (see Kvamme, 2021 ). Since Klafki's works in the 1980s, these challenges have been elaborated within various forms of cosmopolitanism, including the critical cosmopolitanism of Benhabib (2006 , 2011) , considered in Recontextualizations, hegemony, and democratic iterations  section below. The role of the nation–state also emerges as a decisive aspect when we now turn to democracy as another key concept in this entry.  The democratic impasse Within the studies of governance, the contradiction stated above between universal claims adopted unanimously by the nations of the world and the lack of corresponding action have been discussed with regard to the Western, liberal democracies. William Lafferty employs Carl Cohen's definition of democracy as “that system of community government in which, by and large, the members of a community participate, directly or indirectly, in the making of decisions which affect them all” (Lafferty, 2012 , p. 299). Lafferty demonstrates how the notion of community in Western societies historically has been defined by geographical boundaries. Significant here is the development of nation–states, corresponding with a notion of citizenship based on individual membership from which representations of interest emerge. In contrast, sustainable development involves a notion of community based on ecological interdependence with an expanded notion of citizenship that incorporates the interests of future generations, the world's poor, and possibly the interests of other species (Lafferty, 2012 , p. 305). To Lafferty, the contradiction between the notions of community and citizenship demonstrates a main challenge involved in the United Nations' sustainable development agenda. Virtually all nations of the world have formally subscribed to the goal of sustainable development, and the goal is to be realized through democratic means, but the existing democratic structures privilege the interests of the demarcated jurisdictions of nation–states and do not accommodate the normative notions expressed in the goal. Lafferty's conclusion is expressed as “the impasse of dysfunctional democracy,” cf. the subtitle of the paper referred to here (Lafferty, 2012 ). The tensions between existing liberal democracies and implications of sustainable development are also addressed by Westall (2015) . In addition to the restrictions constituted by defined political geographies and legally defined citizens, she points out how liberal democracies have given economic growth primacy while not taking environmental limits into account, often guided by short-termism that makes individual freedom a dominant ethic. In contrast, sustainable development implies considerations on long-term impacts on all affected people including intragenerational and intergenerational equity, an integration of economic, environmental and social considerations accentuating environmental limits to human activity, and an emphasis on shared goals and shared values (including future orientation and concern for nature). Both Lafferty and Westall nevertheless accentuate democracy as the preferred model of governance facing the transformation to sustainable development with particular reference to participation and inclusion. This democratic framing is significant in the context of Agenda 2030. The general commitments in the crucial Goal 16 are to “promote just, peaceful, and inclusive societies”, but democracy is not explicitly mentioned in the SDGs, according to Langford (2016 , p. 173), ensured by China in the drafting process. Here, following Lafferty and Westall, I interpret Goal 16 within the context of a deliberative conception of democracy. As a consequence, Lafferty's formulation of the impasse of democracy should be taken into account.  Curriculum and the SDGs As stated above, the United Nations' engagement with sustainable development has prompted the global education policy of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) initiated and followed up on by UNESCO. Currently within Agenda 2030, this engagement is expressed in the Framework for the implementation of ESD beyond 2019  “ESD for 2030 ” (2020–2030)  (UNESCO, 2019 ) and Education for Sustainable Development A roadmap. ESD for 2030  (UNESCO, 2020 ). Both of these documents are quite general in their approach. The vision is “to build a more just and sustainable world through strengthening ESD and contributing to the achievement of all 17 Sustainable Development Goals” (UNESCO, 2020 ). The scope encompasses both formal and informal learning arenas. One of five priority action areas is to advance education policies, “including those that concern learning environments, curricula, teacher education as well as student assessment” (UNESCO, 2019 , p. 26). Here, curriculum is quite narrowly conceived and clearly distinguished from education policy. A similar conception is reflected in the global indicator to target 4.7.1 referring to the extent “(i) global citizenship education and (ii) education for sustainable development are mainstreamed in (a) national education policies; (b) curricula; (c) teacher education; and (d) student assessment” (UNESCO, 2019 , p. 51). The framing accentuates a strategy in which UNESCO promotes curriculum development on a national level as a contribution to build a more just and sustainable world. The indicators are integrated in a monitoring process where nation states report back to UNESCO. As we see, curriculum is here positioned within the context of nation–states. The aim is definitely not to establish a global curriculum but to encourage nation–states to develop curricula that accommodate the global goals expressed in Agenda 2030. This structure prompts more general considerations on the relationship between global education policy and curriculum. As stated above, UNESCO's strategy of education for sustainable development is an instance of global education policy as an aspect of institutional globalization (Langford, 2016 ). Rizvi and Lingard (2010)  point out how global education policy is framed “by discourses which, while they often have their gestation in various global networks, are negotiated and rearticulated at regional, national, provincial and local levels” (p. 44). Consequently, it is decisive to recognize “the simultaneous plays of the local, national and global as spatial relations in the education policy cycle” (Rizvi and Lingard, 2010 , p. 15; see also Kvamme, 2020a ). The term “policy cycle”, coined by Ball (1994) , refers to the interactive set of relationships between various contexts. It rejects a one-way, linear account of relationships between the setting of policy agendas. From this multilayered approach, the traditional divide between education policy studies and curriculum studies is not sufficient (Rizvi and Lingard, 2010 , pp. 93–94). Rizvi and Lingard's suggestion is to include curriculum studies within the field of policy studies. As important as this might be, from the perspective of curriculum studies, one should as well consider the impact of education policy on curriculum. Of particular relevance for the UNESCO follow-up on Agenda 2030 is the persistent discussion within curriculum studies of the relationship between theory and practice. In a classical take on this matter, Goodson (1994)  points out the prescriptive tendencies in curriculum theories, whether the orientation is guided by scientific management and analysis or by the critique of such an approach guided by meliorism or impossibilism. In either case, the approaches ignore “what is  in pursuit of what might be ” (Goodson, 1994 , p. 29). In other words, Goodson calls for a curriculum theory that is sensitive to particular contexts. With regard to curriculum studies involving the SDGs, a proposal here would first of all be to adopt a multilevel approach including the global, national, and local levels and second, ascertain that the mediations between education policy and curriculum making are accommodated in such a design. A third concern would be to avoid a one-sided emphasis on a top–down perspective and be aware of bottom-up processes as Rizvi and Lingard (2010)  express in the concept of policy circle quoted above. Following Goodson (1994) , the context of educational practices is particularly significant here.  Recontextualizations, hegemony, and democratic iterations A multi-level perspective raises the problem of how movements and uptakes of values, imaginaries, ideas between the various levels are to be understood. Here various approaches have been established (see for instance Røvik's (2016)  study of knowledge transfer as processes of translation). Addressing the democratic impasse considered above, the concept of recontextualization as formulated by Bernstein (2000)  seems to offer a productive entrance. Bernstein draws attention to how discourses are pedagogized  when recontextualized into educational contexts. A transformation is involved because “there is a space in which ideology can play” (Bernstein, 2000 , p. 32). Within Bernstein's theory, recontextualizations concern how social discourse becomes part of legitimate educational knowledge (Loughland and Sriprakash, 2016 ). UN Agenda 2030 is fraught with normativity and values, and the research literature demonstrates that hegemonic structures seem to be involved in the recontextualization processes. With regard to the ESD history, a few examples may suffice to demonstrate how the recontextualization processes involves ideology, here conceived of as the maintenance of current power relations (Ricoeur, 2008 ). Sauvé et al. (2005)  note how the ESD agenda has prioritized economic development at the expense of environmental concerns. Furthermore, studies of the UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development suggest that the ESD agenda has been increasingly adaptable to neoliberalism, reducing political issues to questions of individual preferences and behavior (Huckle and Wals, 2015 ). Others demonstrate how ESD has eased the socially conflicting nature of the ecological crisis (Gonzales-Gaudiano, 2016 ). The possible impact of hegemonic structures on ESD processes has also been problematized. Stefan Bengtsson (2016)  refers to what he claims to be a paradox in much of the scholarly literature criticizing ESD. ESD policy supposedly exercises a power of influence while reproducing hegemonic discourse. Still, Bengtsson claims, there seems to be a space for critical reflection and even deviance. With reference to the political theory of Laclau and Mouffe (1985) , Bengtsson calls for a logic of contingency to replace the logic of necessity that he holds distinguishes scholars who assert that the ESD agenda serves hegemonic forces. However, as one of these scholars expressed in a rejoinder to Bengtsson, the claim that hegemonic structures are at work does not imply that there is no space for dissensus (Jickling, 2016 ). In any case, Bengtsson's reminder demonstrates the significance of the productive work exercised on all levels in the education policy cycle. The moral philosopher and political theorist Seyla Benhabib offers with her critical cosmopolitanism an approach that accommodates both universal claims and the significance of context in processes of recontextualization. With the concept of democratic iterations, Benhabib (2006 , 2011)  notes how human rights are subject to reinterpretations when articulated in new contexts and make space for plurality, disagreements, and conflict. In one regard, Benhabib claims that such iterations will take place in any recontextualizing process, confirming the significance of context in empirical studies. However, democratic iterations has a normative dimension, as well, drawing attention to processes that open up or restrict the space for democratic iterations, a dimension expressed in the concept of jurisgenerativity, employed by Benhabib (2011)  with reference to Robert Cover. From her position within critical theory (Benhabib, 1986 ), Benhabib has developed a political theory of deliberate democracy (Benhabib, 1996 ) that challenges the boundaries of the nation–state. Central is her conception of enlarged thought (Benhabib, 1992 ), drawn from Arendt (1978) , that includes everyone who may possibly be influenced by the action in question in the act of deliberation. Benhabib's conceptions are consistent with the perspectives within critical pedagogy as accounted for above. In my own empirical studies, I have employed Benhabib's approach in a multi-level exploration of recontextualizations of environmental ethical values expressed within the UN agenda in Norwegian educational contexts and even in the school strikes for the climate (Kvamme, 2018 , 2019 , 2020a ,b ; see also Wahlström, 2009  for the employment of Benhabib within curriculum studies). I suggest that hegemonic processes are at work, including anthropocentrism, neoliberalism, and the boundaries of the nation–state, but also identify how the environmental ethical values formulated by the United Nations become resources for critique, empowerment, and transformative action. These studies demonstrate the decisive normative dimension of the United Nations' sustainable development agenda. This aspect is what I will address in the following section focused on relations between curriculum, deliberation, and ethics.  Deliberation and the ethical dimension involved Deliberative perspectives in modern curriculum theory are strongly connected to the American curriculum scholar Joseph Schwab and his conceptions of the practical (Schwab, 1969 ). Decisive is the priority given to deliberative practices concerning practical problems, initiating further discussion by other scholars. William A. Reid's considerations on the relationships between deliberation and ethics are particularly interesting with regard to issues raised in this entry. Reid (1994)  proposes that curriculum problems are uncertain, practical, and moral problems. The practical aspect is mainly due to the fact that curriculum problems demand solutions in the form of action, whether as written curriculums or in the actual teaching in the classroom. The ethical aspect is made visible in the formulation of the major question posed as “What ought  we to do?” leading to further questions of responsibility. The ethical responsibility involves all who are affected by the action being chosen. The uncertainty is pointing at the particularity of curriculum work. It always occurs within a unique context. How are curriculum problems to be dealt with, then? In his proposal, Reid refers to deliberation, specifically “the notion of inquiry” through which practical problems have to be resolved involving all who are affected, influencing and determining moral, political, and social actions (Reid, 1994 , p. 18). Reid's perspective is specific and practical, reflecting school systems in which curriculum work traditionally has been carried out locally. Although definitely not multi-layered in orientation, his perspectives nevertheless contribute to the discussion carried out here. First of all, Reid notes the significance of context, as emphasized above with reference to Benhabib. Second, Reid premises that curriculum practices as deliberations involve all who are affected, and finally, they emerge as an ethical responsibility. Reid's contributions exemplify how curriculum theory until recently has been almost solely framed within geographical boundaries determining notions of community and participation. The message from cosmopolitan theory is that the local context is never just local (Beck, 2006 ; Mannion, 2015 ; Benhabib, 2006 , 2011 ; Papastephanou, 2012 ). In numerous ways, the global has impact on the local and expands those affected by the chosen action. The intimate relationship between community and curriculum exposed in Reid's account is radically enhanced when the SDGs and Agenda 2030 are taken into account. Here, the question posed by Reid of what ought we to do emerges as a political issue and a policy task that, following the policy definition of Rizvi and Lingard (2010 , p. 7), is concerned with “the authoritative allocation of values.” The ideal of deliberation is retrieved in the drafting process that produced UN Agenda 2030 and the 17 SDGs. Fox and Stoett (2016)  contrast this process with the elite donor-driven process that led to the Millennium Development Goals and conclude that the 2030 Agenda process facilitated several arenas for citizen participation, and opened new paths toward the establishment of global democratic governance. The participatory process is a main reason for ending up with as many as 17 goals (Langford, 2016 ) that constitute a thematic repertoire ranging from poverty, health, education, and inequality to water, energy, work, infrastructure (including climate, life on earth and underwater), peace, security, and good governance. However, Fox and Stoett (2016)  conclude that, despite their positive assessment, the drafting process remained far from an ideal participatory democracy. Others have been even more critical, demonstrating how hegemonic forces of anthropocentrism and neoliberalism are expressed in the document adopted by the United Nations General Assembly (Adelman, 2018 ; Kotzé, 2018 ). This discussion confirms the normative and ethical dimension involved, echoing Reid's insistence on an ethical responsibility in curriculum practices conceived of as deliberation. Without the ethical dimension, the call for sustainable development is not justified (Kemp, 2011 ; Lafferty, 2012 ). Decisive is the concern for intragenerational and intergenerational justice for all and the protection of life on earth in all its diversity. Although the SDGs should probably not be considered a global curriculum, it is conspicuous how Agenda 2030, at its most general level, is a call to transform people, practices, and structures everywhere. This ambition transcends educational institutions and extends to informal and non-formal learning arenas alike and expresses an imaginary that is obviously pertinent when the impacts of the SDGs on national curricula are to be considered.  The SDGs as a common good? In the previous section, I suggested that the drafting process of Agenda 2030 and the SDGs may be productively considered from the perspective of curriculum theory. The concern has not been to claim that this UN endeavor reflects a curriculum process in itself, but to demonstrate Agenda 2030's significance as more than a passive background for UNESCO's follow-up in the global education policy of Education for Sustainable Development. In this section I elaborate on this while exploring a position that connects the SDGs with the common good,  as this notion emerges within the UNESCO context. In the UNESCO report Rethinking Education: Toward a global common good?  (UNESCO, 2015 ), a key contribution is the consideration of education and knowledge as a global common good. With reference to Deneulin and Townsend (2007) , the report states that the common good is “constituted by goods that humans share intrinsically in common and that they communicate to each other, such as values, civic virtues and a sense of justice” (UNESCO, 2015 , p. 77). The notion of the common good is different from the notion of the public good in which human well-being is framed by individualistic socio-economic theory. From the common good perspective, it is not just the good life of individuals that matters but also the goodness of the life that humans hold in common (UNESCO, 2015 , p. 78). Moreover, the weight on community is expressed in the emphasis on participatory processes that stand out as a common good in themselves. In the UNESCO report the notion of education as a common good is contrasted with tendencies in current education policy to conceive learning as an individual process of skill acquisition with little attention paid to questions of the purpose of education and the organization of learning opportunities as a collective social endeavor. Furthermore, learning has been essentially centered on the results of educational processes and neglected the processes of learning (UNESCO, 2015 , pp. 80–81). While this perspective has bearings on how SDG 4 on quality education is considered, the emphasis on both education and knowledge may be seen as an invitation to mediate between this particular goal and the sustainable development agenda as a whole. The UNESCO report actually suggests such a mediation itself:Given the central concern for sustainable development in an increasingly interdependent world, education and knowledge should thus be considered global common goods. This means that the creation of knowledge, its control, acquisition, validation, and use, are common to all people as a collective social endeavor.  The governance of education can no longer be separated from the governance of knowledge. UNESCO (2015 , p. 80).   A major aspect of Agenda 2030 and the SDGs is definitely the governance of knowledge, consequently opening up for connecting the SDGs to the common good. While a conception of the SDGs as a common good is an intriguing, but complicated matter that cannot be sufficiently unpacked in this entry (see also Lotz-Sisitka, 2017 ), the relationship between the SDGs and the notion of the common good should be considered by revisiting the democratic impasse accounted for in The democratic impasse  section above, particularly addressing community and membership. As Lafferty (2012 , p. 306) pointed out, nation–states as communities have historically been seen as delimited spatial units organized for self-governance, while sustainable development involves a notion of community based on ecological interdependence incorporating the interests of future generations, the world's poor, and the interests of other species. Connecting the SDGs to the common good accentuates this expanded notion of community, and demonstrates how goods that are intrinsically shared in common across borders, are under threat. As long as interests of the nation–states are determining political priorities, the impasse will remain. With regard to membership, sustainable development implies that citizenship cannot solely be conceived of within the nation states, but is global in scope. In Resolution 70/1 Transforming our world , a vision of solidarity is distinctly stated in the preamble, “As we embark on this collective journey, we pledge that no one will be left behind” (United Nations, 2015 ), and SDG 10 Reduced inequalities  particularly address the social, economic and political inclusion of all (United Nations, 2015 ). When the SDGs in such ways are connected with the notion of the common good, the contextual and processual character of this notion should also be considered. The UNESCO report Rethinking Education: Toward a global common good?  proposes: “What is meant by the common good can only be defined with regard to the diversity of contexts and conceptions of well-being and common life” (UNESCO, 2015 , p. 78). This proposal opens for considering the recontextualizations of the SDGs in various regional, national, and local contexts as aspects of the common good. If so, the perspective is definitely also pertinent to curriculum practices as accentuated by Schwab and Reid. An emphasis on community and participation offers a critical perspective for empirical curriculum studies on the SDGs and on ESD initiatives. A decisive ethical and political concern is whose perspectives “are privileged in the curriculum as well as in education institutions more generally” (Apple and Buras, 2006 , p. 3). Such a critical perspective may be conceived of as an immanent critique “of social practices using principles that are reconstructed from those very practices, rather than using principles that have their validity established by moral arguments that do not refer to the practices to which the principles are applied” (Stahl, 2019 ). Identifications of contradictions and impasses involved, as addressed in this entry, are instances of such an immanent critique, considering values and concerns expressed in the UN sustainable development agenda itself. Most probably, the democratic impasse as posed by Lafferty (2012) , still distinguishes processes within Agenda 2030 and the SDGs in the decade we have entered, and the reproductions of hegemonic structures and practices still take place in the recontextualization processes, and should be subject to critique within curriculum studies. However, as Benhabib has emphasized, claims made within structures like the United Nations that express an institutional cosmopolitanism may have mobilizing and transforming functions (Benhabib, 2011 ). A prime example of such a bottom-up initiative is the school strikes for the climate (Kvamme, 2019 ). Thus, Bengtsson's (2016)  appeal to a logic of contingency in curriculum studies on education for sustainable development should be considered.  Conclusion This entry has addressed aspects of curriculum, democracy, and the UN's sustainable development goals. A concern has been to demonstrate how the various perspectives in many respects are intertwined, transcending the borders of the nation–states, and calling for a multi-layered approach. Still, a deliberative position on curriculum practices and democracy has been adopted with an emphasis on the significance of context. In the final part of the entry, a major suggestion has been to connect the SDGs–including both the drafting processes, the UN Resolution 70/1 (United Nations, 2015 ), and subsequent recontextualizations—with the notion of the common good. Such a connection may premise critical studies of the curriculum processes that are promoted in the global education policy of ESD. Finally, let us return to Reid and a pertinent reminder that demonstrates how the global common good explored in this entry resonates with a curriculum theory that emerges from the local and the practical. “We are never going to realize perfect curricula, but schools, teaching, assessments, and mandates will only serve the good of society insofar as they are guided by curricular ideals” (Reid, 2006 , p. 2).
