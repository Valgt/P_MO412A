                  The Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP) is an important ecosystem service provider but increasing human activities have led to ecosystem degradation. Several ecological engineering projects (EEPs) have been adopted to restore the degraded ecosystems. To analyze changes in ecosystem services on the QTP and their contribution to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) following the implementation of the EEPs, and to explore the roles of different types of EEPs and climate in this process. Quantified changes in the six key ecosystem services and their trade-offs at the county level since the implementation of the ecological project, and further calculated the progress of the contribution of ecosystem services to the achievement of the SDGs based on the “Ecosystem service-SDGs” contribution framework. The results show that since the implementation of the EEPs, the ecosystem services of the QTP have generally improved. Over 70% of the counties showed continuous improvement in water yield, food production, soil retention, and sandstorm prevention, particularly in the central and eastern parts of the QTP. Synergistic relationships are maintained between provisioning, regulating and supporting services. Ecosystem service-based SDG scores (ESSDG) showed a distribution pattern of high southeast and low northwest in the QTP, and increased in 75.22% of counties between 2000 and 2020. Our study revealed that the EEPs contributed to the realization of SDGs in QTP by improving ecosystem services, especially in the areas where the Grain for Green projects was implemented. Sustainable ecosystem management following the implementation of EEPs may benefit future contributions to SDGs realization.

The Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP) is an important ecosystem service provider but increasing human activities have led to ecosystem degradation. Several ecological engineering projects (EEPs) have been adopted to restore the degraded ecosystems. To analyze changes in ecosystem services on the QTP and their contribution to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) following the implementation of the EEPs, and to explore the roles of different types of EEPs and climate in this process. Quantified changes in the six key ecosystem services and their trade-offs at the county level since the implementation of the ecological project, and further calculated the progress of the contribution of ecosystem services to the achievement of the SDGs based on the “Ecosystem service-SDGs” contribution framework. The results show that since the implementation of the EEPs, the ecosystem services of the QTP have generally improved. Over 70% of the counties showed continuous improvement in water yield, food production, soil retention, and sandstorm prevention, particularly in the central and eastern parts of the QTP. Synergistic relationships are maintained between provisioning, regulating and supporting services. Ecosystem service-based SDG scores (ESSDG) showed a distribution pattern of high southeast and low northwest in the QTP, and increased in 75.22% of counties between 2000 and 2020. Our study revealed that the EEPs contributed to the realization of SDGs in QTP by improving ecosystem services, especially in the areas where the Grain for Green projects was implemented. Sustainable ecosystem management following the implementation of EEPs may benefit future contributions to SDGs realization.

Since 2005, the UN Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) framework for ecosystem services has gained in importance (Druckenmiller, 2022 ). With the ability to assess ecosystem services at different scales, they have increasingly become important reference indicators for the sustainable management of ecosystems (Bai et al., 2018 ). In addition to the assessment of ecosystem service supply and provisioning, researchers have identified trade-offs or synergistic relationships between ecosystem services (Bennett et al., 2009 ; Rodríguez et al., 2006 ). The quantification and regulation of such relationships are critical for ecosystem management and regional sustainable development (He et al., 2020 ; Zhang et al., 2022a ). To provide guidance for sustainable development around the world, in 2015, the 193 United Nations member states adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which proposed a system of targets involving 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 sub-targets. Compared with the millennium development goals that ended in 2015, the 2030 SDGs increased the number of targets in the energy, water, urban, and ecosystem conservation arenas. The SDGs provide specific indicators that can be measured and calculated under each target. However, owing to differences in the political and economic contexts in different countries and regions, as well as the lack of statistical data, these indicators cannot be quantified and used to assess sustainable development processes everywhere. On this basis, the United Nations Development Programme and scholars have emphasized the importance of localizing the SDGs measurement indicators (Yang et al., 2022 ). The potential of ecosystem services as indicators that can synthesize the biophysical characteristics of a region and connect natural ecosystems with human well-being has been discussed for use in SDG assessment. Wood et al. (2018)  identified the importance of ecosystem services to the achievement of the 2030 SDGs through a global survey of academics working on ecosystem services and policy makers working on resource management. By integrating the researchers' perspectives, they found that the 16 ecosystem services surveyed were considered to contribute to the achievement of 41 targets from 12 SDGs. A contribution framework of “Ecosystem services-Target” based on survey data established (Wood et al., 2018 ). Chen et al. (2021) constructed an evaluation formula to score the contribution of ecosystem services to SDGs, based on Wood et al.'s (2018) ecosystem services–SDGs contribution information that integrated expert perspectives. Using this formula, they assessed the contribution of five key ecosystem services to each SDG in the Yangtze River basin. They identified the impact of different levels of ecosystem service provision on the sustainable development process in each region, and explored the pathway for monitoring SDGs using geospatial data. Research on the contribution of one or more ecosystem services to SDGs has since advanced from quantification using expert questionnaires to analysis of the mechanisms of ecosystem service impacts on specific SDGs (Hu et al., 2022 ; Yin et al., 2023b ). Linking ecosystem services to SDGs through the natural dimension can help the synergistic realization of multiple aspects in the process of achieving SDGs, and also provide an important reference for sustainable ecosystem management and implementation of ecological engineering projects (EEPs) (Mandle et al., 2020 ; Yin et al., 2021 ). As the third pole of the world, the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP) plays an important role as an ecological security barrier for China and Asia. It is also known as the “Water Tower of Asia” because it is the source of many important rivers and provides a reliable water source for nearly two billion people (Yao et al., 2022 ). The alpine ecosystems of the QTP provide a wide range of ecosystem services, such as food supply, WY, SR, sandstorm prevention, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity conservation, and they are critical to regional ecological security and socioeconomic development (Sun et al., 2020 ). However, alpine ecosystems are fragile and sensitive because of their particular formation mechanism, and human activities such as intensive grazing and agricultural development have caused serious degradation of alpine ecosystems over the last century (Li et al., 2021 ). In addition, the climate of the QTP has changed substantially since the 1980s (Wang et al., 2022 ). To restore degraded ecosystems and enhance the ability of alpine ecosystems to adapt to climate change, the government has implemented several EEPs in the QTP since 2000, such as the Grain for Green Project, Natural Forest Conservation Project, and Grassland Ecological Protection Project (Huang et al., 2018 ; Ma et al., 2023 ). The EEPs implemented by the Chinese government to improve ecosystems are ultimately aimed at achieving regional sustainability, and it is important to assess their contribution to sustainable development should be assessed. For example, Bryan et al. (2018)  assessed the contribution of 16 large-scale ecological projects implemented in China since the 1980s to 17 SDGs. The International Council for Science recognized that ecosystem conservation, restoration, and the sustainable supply of ecosystem services contributed to the achievement of SDGs (Icsu, 2015 ). How changes in ecosystem services specifically affect the realization of the SDGs has gradually attracted the attention of researchers (Wood et al., 2018 ; Yang et al., 2022 ). As a regionally important ecosystem service provider, the status of ecosystem services on the QTP is directly related to the process of regional SDGs realization (Zhang et al., 2022b ). It is necessary to explore how changes in ecosystem services since the implementation of the EEPs have affected the process of regional SDGs realization. This study aims to investigate the changes in the contribution of ecosystem services to the realization of SDGs in QTP since the implementation of the EEPs, using the “Ecosystem services-SDGs” contribution framework. Specific objectives include: (1) to quantify key ecosystem services in Qinghai-Tibet since the implementation of the ecological project; (2) quantify the relationship between ecosystem services at different stages of the process; (3) quantify the spatial and temporal changes in the specific contributions of ecosystem services to the SDGs process (4) reveal the process of SDGs realization and climate change characteristics in different ecological engineering implementation regions. The results of the study can provide a reference for the management and adjustment of EEPs in the QTP to promote the process of realizing SDGs.  2 Data and methods 2.1 Study area The QTP is located in southwest China (26°00′–39°47′ N, 73°19′–104°47′ E), with an average altitude of over 4000 m. It is divided into six administrative provinces: Tibet, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Gansu, Yunnan, and Sichuan (Fig. 1  ). The unique geography of the QTP gives rise to alpine ecosystems that provide important ecosystem services such as soil retention, sandstorm prevention, biodiversity maintenance, carbon sequestration, and oxygen release. However, alpine ecosystems are inherently vulnerable and sensitive to climate change and human disturbance (Hou et al., 2020 ). Since the 1970s, the QTP has experienced rapid environmental change with a warming rate of approximately 0.4 °C per decade, almost twice the global average (Kuang and Jiao, 2016 ; Latif et al., 2019 ). Since the mid-twentieth century, glaciers on the QTP have retreated substantially, shrinking by 5%–10% over the past 30 years (Yao et al., 2012 ). In addition to climate change, the QTP is under increasing pressure from human activities. Between 1970 and 2020, the population more than doubled from 5.5 million to 11.2 million and urbanization rates increased rapidly. Livestock numbers have also rapidly increased since the 1970s, growing from 67.7 million to 113.3 million standard sheep. Overgrazing has led to pasture degradation, especially in the northwestern part of the plateau. Combined with changes in warming and precipitation, these human activities have affected the biogeochemistry of the QTP (Chen et al., 2022b ; Wang et al., 2022 ), and have caused extensive alpine ecosystem degradation. To restore degraded alpine ecosystems and promote sustainable management of ecosystems, the Chinese government has gradually implemented EEPs such as reforestation since 2000 (Hua et al., 2022 ; Huang et al., 2018 ). The two projects of Grain for Green Project (GFGP) and Return Grazing Land for Grassland Project (RGFGP) were implemented earlier on the plateau and currently they have the widest coverage on the QTP, covering more than 80% of the counties in the region (Fig. 1 ).  2.2 Framework The implementation of EEPs and climate change affects the growth and amount of vegetation, which further affects the supply of ecosystem services. Changes in different ecosystem services and their relationships will further affect their contribution to SDGs. Changes in six key ecosystem services on the QTP since the implementation of the EEPs (2000) were quantified, including provisioning services (food production, water yield), regulating services (sandstorm prevention, soil retention, and carbon sequestration), and supporting services (biodiversity conservation). Because the EEPs were implemented in counties as administrative units, the raster-scale ecosystem services were averaged to the county level for the study. Multifactor analysis (MFA) was used to quantify the trade-offs between provisioning, regulating and supporting services, while the relationship between the six ecosystem services was quantified using Pearson's correlation. On the basis of county-level ecosystem service supply, the contribution of county-level ecosystem services to the scores of 11 SDGs on the Tibetan Plateau was calculated by combining the methods proposed by Wood et al. (2018)  and Chen et al. (2021). The current study further calculated the combined ecosystem service-based SDGs score (ESSDG). This approach allowed the effects of EEPs and climate change on ESSDG in different EEPs implementation regions to be analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively (Fig. 2  ).  2.3 Data sources To calculate ecosystem services, the data used by the study as input to the InVEST, RWEQ and CASA models included meteorological data, NDVI, DEM, land use, soil properties, road data and food production, in addition to vector administrative boundaries and EEPs extent data (Table 1  ).  2.4 Quantifying Ecosystem services 2.4.1 Sandstorm prevention The RWEQ model developed by the U.S. Department of agriculture fully considers climate conditions, surface roughness, soil erodibility and surface vegetation and is widely used for soil wind erosion assessment at different scales (Chi et al., 2019 ). The potential soil wind erosion minus the actual soil wind erosion is used as the sandstorm prevention amount under the vegetation cover to serve as the sandstorm prevention (SP).(1) SL = 2 z  s 2   Q max  e − z S   2       (2) Q max  = 109.8 WF ∙ EF ∙ SCF ∙ K ′  ∙ COG      (3) S = 105.71 WF ∙ EF ∙ SCF ∙ K ′  ∙ COG   − 0.3711      where SL  is the displayed soil wind erosion (kg/m2 ) under vegetation coverage, and Q max   is the maximum sediment transport capacity of actual wind (kg/m2 ), S  is the length of key plot (m), SLP  is the potential soil wind erosion under bare soil conditions, WF  is the meteorological factor (kg/M), EF  is the soil erodibility factor, SCF  is the soil crust factor, COG  is the vegetation factor, and K′  is the surface roughness factor.  2.4.2 Soil retention Soil retention (SR) refers to the soil maintained by the ecosystem within one year. Based on the principle of sediment transport ratio (SDR) module in the InVEST model, this study defines SR as the difference between potential soil loss and actual soil loss(Wischmeier and Smith, 1978 ). The SDR module is based on the improved universal soil loss equation (USLE):(4) RKLS = R × K × LS    (5) USLE = R × K × LS × C × P    where RKLS  is the potential maximum soil loss (t hm−2  yr−1 ), and USLE is the actual soil loss (t hm−2  yr−1 ); R  is rainfall erosion factor (MJ mm hm−2 H−1  yr−1 ), K is soil erodibility factor (t h HM−2  MJ−1  mm−1 ), LS  is slope length factor, C  is vegetation coverage and management factor, and P  is soil and water conservation measure factor.  2.4.3 Water yield The water yield (WY) module of the invest model is used to calculate the WY of the ecosystem. The WY module of the invest model calculates the annual scale WY based on Budyko's water heat coupling balance hypothesis and the annual precipitation data(Budyko, 1974 ):(6) Y xj  = 1 − AET xj  P x     × P x     where Y xj   is the annual water volume (mm) of grid unit x  of land use type j , AET xj   is the annual actual evapotranspiration (mm) of grid unit x  of land use type j , and P x   is the annual precipitation of grid x .  2.4.4 Carbon Sequestration Net primary productivity (NPP) is an indicator often used to reflect the capacity of ecosystems for carbon sequestration (Liu et al., 2019 ). CASA model is a photosynthetic utilization rate model applied to the calculation of NPP of vegetation. The model mainly includes the calculation of two variables, i.e. photosynthetic effective radiation absorbed by plants and solar energy utilization rate. It is driven by the vegetation coverage data retrieved from remote sensing and meteorological element data such as precipitation, temperature and solar radiation (Piao et al., 2005 ), In addition, some studies have proved the effectiveness of the CASA model in simulating NPP in the QTP by fitting the assessment results of the CASA model with the measured vegetation NPP (Zhu et al., 2006 ). The main part of the model is as follows:(7) NPP x t  = APAR x t  × ε x t     where, APAR (x, t ) is the photosynthetic effective radiation (MJ/m2 ) absorbed by pixel x  in month t , ε  (x, t ) is the light energy utilization rate (g C/MJ) of pixel x  in month t .(8) APAR x t  = SOL x t  × FPAR x t  × 0.5    (9) ε x t  = T ε 1   x t  × T ε 2   x t  × W ε  x t  × ε max     where, SOL (x, t ) is the total solar radiation (MJ/m2 ) of pixel x  in month t , T ε1  (x, t ) and T ε2   (x, t ) is the stress coefficient of pixel x low temperature and high temperature on light and utilization efficiency, W ε  (x,t ) is the water stress coefficient, which is the maximum light and utilization efficiency in the ideal state.  2.4.5 Biodiversity conservation Regional biodiversity conservation (BC) were calculated using the habitat quality module of the InVEST model with the following equation (Zhao et al., 2022 ):(10) Q xj  = H j  1 − D xj z  k 2  + D xj z          where Q xj   is the habitat quality index of x  raster in habitat type j ; H j   is the habitat suitability of habitat type j , with a value range of [0,1]; k  is the half-saturation constant, which is half of the maximum habitat degradation (obtained once by the model operation); z  is the normalization constant, usually set to 2.5.  2.4.6 Food production Based on the linear relationship between grain yield and NDVI, we differenced the total regional food production (FP) to the raster scale based on the NDVI of the cropland in the study area (Peng et al., 2017 ).(11)  G x  = NDVI x  NDVI sum   × G sum      Where: G x   is the grain yield of raster x ; G sum   is the total grain yield; NDVI x   is the NDVI  value of raster x ; NDVI sum   is the sum of NDVI values of cultivated land in the study area.   2.5 Quantifying SDG score Based on the heat map of ecosystem service contributions to the SDGs summarized by Wood et al. (2018)  through an expert knowledge approach, we intercepted the six ecosystem services used in this study and constructed a heat map of ecosystem service contributions to the SDGs. (Fig. S1). The WY, FP, NPP and BC of the ecosystem services we assessed match the ecosystem service connotations in the framework proposed by Wood et al. (2018) . In addition, for erosion control in their framework, we use here the mean value of the two ecosystem services of SR and SP. To calculate the contribution of ecosystem services to SDG, it is first necessary to standardize ecosystem services of different magnitudes with the following formula:(12) ES i j   = ES i , j   − ES i , min    ES i , max   − ES i , min        where ES (i,j ) is the standardized value of the i -th ecosystem service in the j -th raster, ES i  , j  is the amount of material of the i -th ecosystem service in the j -th raster, ESi, min  is the minimum value of the i -th ecosystem service in the study area, and ES i, max  is the minimum value of the i -th ecosystem service in the study area. The calculation of each ecosystem service-based SDG score is mainly based on the contribution correlation between the corresponding target of the SDG and each ecosystem service, and ecosystem services with weak and strong degree of correlation with the target will be included in the calculation of the j -th SDG, and the SDG score is calculated based on the contribution relationship between ES-target under each SDG.(13) SDG j  = ∑ i = 1  n  ES i  × x i  × T ij  × y j     ∑ i = 1  n  T i , j         where SDG j   is based on the j -th SDG score of the ecosystem service, ES i   is the normalized i-th ecosystem service, X i   is the weight of i  ecosystem service in the j -th SDG, T ij   is the several contribution chains of the i -th ecosystem service in SDG j  , and Y i   is the weight of the j -th ecosystem service and a certain SDG-target in the j -th SDG. The comprehensive ES-SDG contribution-based score is calculated by averaging the individual SDG scores with the following formula:(14) ESSDG = ∑ j = 1  m  SDG j   m     where ESSDG is a comprehensive score that represents the combined performance of regional ecosystem services in contributing to the SDGs. m is the number of SDGs, and the SDGs involved in this study are 11, m = 11.  2.6 Quantifying interactions between ecosystem services In order to reveal the trade-off/synergistic relationships among ecosystem services as comprehensively as possible, we quantified the relationships among the three major categories of provisioning, supporting and regulating services, respectively, and further identified the relationships between two of the six ecosystem services. Multifactor analysis (MFA) can generate off-axis plots reflecting the interrelationships between principal components of different data sets based on the classification of variables, and studies have been conducted to determine the trade-off/synergistic relationships and their strengths between various types of collections using the perspective between the first principal components of the plots (Zhang et al., 2022c ). In addition, Pearson correlation analysis was used to reveal two-by-two interrelationships for each ecosystem service, and correlation coefficients were used to determine the trade-off/synergistic relationships between two ecosystem services and their strengths.  2.7 Other methods We used linear regression to explore the effects of EEPs on ESSDG changes from the county scale, recoding three types of areas with only reforestation, only pasture restoration, and both reforestation and pasture restoration projects to generate dummy variables, and incorporating two important climate factor variables, multi-year temperature and average rate of precipitation change (Zhang et al., 2021a ). The Sen's slope was used to explore the trend of climate change from 2000 to 2020. Sen's slope avoids the loss of time series data and the influence of data distribution on the analysis results, and has superior performance in the trend analysis of time series (Liu et al., 2022 ). In addition, paired-sample t -tests were used to test the significance of changes in ecosystem services at different stages.   3 Results 3.1 Spatial patterns and changes in ecosystem services since EEPs implementation The overall spatial distribution of the supply levels of six key ecosystem services on the QTP did not show substantial changes during 2000–2020 (Fig. 3  ), but many local changes and an overall increase in supply occurred (Fig. S2). Provisioning services showed a clear spatial pattern of high in the southeast to low in the northwest. WY as a whole shows a decreasing spatial distribution pattern from southeast to northwest. During the period 2000–2020, WY on the QTP in general experienced a significant increase (Table 2  ). In terms of spatial changes, the average growth rate of WY in most counties in north-central Tibet and the northeastern QTP was more than 10%. In particular, the number of counties with high-level WY that produced more than 300 mm of water in 2020 exceeded 140 counties. The spatial pattern of FP was relatively stable, and the FP in the Yarlung Zangbo River, Nyangqu River and Lhasa River Basin (YNLB), which is an important agricultural production area in Tibet, was always between 100 and 200 tons/km2  in all counties. FP on the QTP as a whole increased significantly after 2005 (Table 2 ), and in terms of spatial variation, the eastern part of the plateau saw a larger overall increase in FP, especially in some counties in eastern Qinghai and Sichuan provinces, where the average increase was more than 5%. The supply of the three regulation services differed spatially and temporally. SR shows a spatial distribution from southeast to northwest in QTP. Most counties in the southeastern part of the plateau have an average SR of more than 100 tons, while SR in the northwestern part of the plateau is generally low. SR on the QTP experienced a decrease and then an increase from 2000 to 2020 (Table 2 ), and in general, with more than 80% of counties showing an increase in the overall period. SP in QTP varied considerably between 2000 and 2020, experiencing a significant increase-decrease-increase process (Table 2 ). At the level of spatial distribution, except for 2005, the other years show some commonality, with relatively large amounts of SP in the middle and upper reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo River and the northeastern part of the plateau. During the period 2000–2020, NPP on the QTP maintained a spatial distribution pattern, with the average level of NPP in counties in the central and western parts of the plateau generally exceeding 200 g C/m2 , and the overall level in counties on the eastern edge of the plateau being at 300 g C/m2  and above. During the period 2010–2015, NPP underwent a significant decrease (Table 2 ), which was mainly distributed in the southeastern and southwestern parts of the plateau. BC as the only supporting service in the study, maintained a relatively stable spatial distribution pattern and status. The spatial distribution characteristics of the habitat quality index, which represented BC, decreased from southeast to northwest. Overall, BC the QTP did not change significantly in overall level and spatial distribution over the period 2000–2020.  3.2 Ecosystem services trade-off dynamics since EEPs implementation The relationships among provisioning services (WY and FP), regulating services (ST, sandstorm prevention, NPP) and supporting services (BC) quantified from the perspective of broad ecosystem service categories (Fig. 4  ) showed that the three types of ecosystem services on the QTP maintained an overall synergistic relationship during 2000–2020. The synergistic relationship between provisioning services and regulation services tended to increase and then decrease, while the synergistic relationship between provisioning services and supporting services strengthened. The synergistic relationship between regulating services and supporting services weakened overall. The RV coefficient between provisioning services and regulation services decreased from 0.299 to 0.143, and the synergistic relationship showed a significant trade-off trend. Specifically, in terms of the relationships between each ecosystem service, during the period 2000–2020 there were significant trade-offs between SP and other ecosystem services. However, the magnitude of trade-offs diminished, while the significant synergistic relationships that existed between all other ecosystem services were sustained (Fig. S3).  3.3 Contribution of ecosystem services to the SDGs progress in QTP since EEPs 3.3.1 Average contribution of ecosystem services to individual SDGs On the basis of the scores of 11 SDGs that were calculated for each county on the QTP (Fig. 5  ), the overall spatial distribution of each SDG score was consistent with the spatial distribution of ecosystem service supply levels, reflecting a high level in the southeast and a low level in the northwest. This was especially similar to the distribution of five ecosystem services: WY, NPP, food production, SR, and biodiversity conservation. The counties on the eastern and southeastern edges of the plateau had SDG scores above 30, while in the northwestern part of the plateau, especially in Ali and Nagqu in Tibet and most counties in southern Xinjiang, the SDG scores were less than 20. In line with the belief of experts that there were differences in the weights of different ES contributions to different SDGs, there were also local differences in the magnitude and spatial distribution of each SDG score. For example, SDG1, SDG2, SDG3, SDG6, SDG8, SDG11, and SDG12 scores reached above 50 in most counties in the east and south, and the scores for other SDGs in these counties were also mostly between 40 and 50. In terms of spatial distribution, no two SDGs were identical, and except for a few counties in the southeastern part of the highlands, counties in other regions were classified in the highest scoring range in any of the SDG scores. The spatial differences in each SDG score mainly reflected local differences in some counties. The average rate of change of SDG scores between 2000 and 2020 (Fig. S4) showed that the spatial distribution of SDG changes was similar, but the amount of change varied. The areas with increased SDG scores were concentrated in the central and eastern parts of the plateau, where the average growth rate of SDG1, SDG2, SDG3, SDG7, SDG8 and SDG15 scores in some counties exceeded 10%. The areas with reduced scores for each SDG were mainly located in the Yarlung Tsangpo River Basin and the western and northern edges of the plateau, with some counties in the region experiencing an average 5% reduction in SDG1, SDG2, SDG3, SDG6, SDG7, SDG8, and SDG15 scores.  3.3.2 Spatiotemporal patterns and changes in ESSDG On the basis of the 11 SDG scores, the ESSDG for the QTP was calculated. Its overall spatial distribution was consistent with the distribution of the individual SDG scores (Fig. 6  ). The highest value of ESSDG was distributed in the eastern and southeastern parts of the plateau. The average comprehensive ESSDG of these counties was above 30 all year round, with the ESSDG of counties in Sichuan Province being above 40 during 2000–2020. The ESSDG of YNLB was always in the middle level—between 20 and 40—in the QTP. In terms of changes between 2000 and 2020 (Fig. 6 f), the average ESSDG on the Tibetan Plateau increased from 40.09 in 2000 to 44.42, and 173 counties out of 230 counties on the plateau had positive average change rates. Out of these, 60 counties had ESSDG growth rates of more than 5% between 2000 and 2020. The YNLB area had a more concentrated distribution of ESSDG reduction, but few counties on the western and northern edges of the plateau had an ESSDG reduction of 5% or more.   3.4 Identify the contribution of EEPs to ESSDG Between 2000 and 2020, for the regions without EEPs, the trend of ESSDG change was basically consistent with the trend in precipitation. Especially in 2010, which had a combination of higher mean annual temperature, scarce precipitation, and more drought, the decrease of ESSDG was obvious (Fig. 7 a ). The trend in ESSDG change after 2005 was consistent with the trend in precipitation change in the area where only the grazing restoration project had been implemented, and it was also consistent with the trend of temperature change after 2010. This finding indicated the dominant influence of climate change on ESSDG (Fig. 7 b). The ESSDG in the reforestation implementation area increased continuously during 2000–2020, although the temperature and precipitation both fluctuated, which reflects the ability of the afforestation project to enhance regional ecosystem service supply capacity (Fig. 7 c). For the regions where both reforestation and grazing projects were implemented, ESSDG as a whole increased between 2000 and 2020, although the climate still fluctuated (Fig. 7 d). The results of linear regression showed that the change in precipitation and the implementation of the two EEPs of returning pasture to grass and cropland to forest had a significant impact on the change of ESSDG (Table S1). Combining the change of ESSDG (Fig. 6 ) and the climate change trend (Fig. S5), it was found that the counties with a more than 10% increase in ESSDG and the most significant trend of increasing precipitation were both distributed in the northeastern part of the plateau. In addition, most regions where the two EEPs were implemented achieved ESSDG increases of 1% and above.   4 Discussion 4.1 Changes in ecosystem services and their impact on SDGs The supply levels of six key ecosystem services on the QTP did not change significantly in their overall spatial pattern between 2000 and 2020, but there were some local variations in different services. For example, WY increased significantly in the eastern and northern counties of the plateau, NPP decreased in the northwestern counties of Tibet, and food production increased in many counties of the YNLB as a whole, which were consistent with the findings of Hou et al. (2020)  and Huang et al. (2023) . The increase in multiple ecosystem services in the central and eastern plateau resulted in a significant increase in the combined ESSDG scores in the counties of the eastern plateau, with an average increase of 10% and above. The larger average increases in WY, SR, and SP directly contributed to the increase in ESSDG in counties in the eastern part of the plateau. Overall, ecosystem services are an important foundation for achieving sustainable development goals. The overall spatial distribution and variability of individual SDG and ESSDG based on the contribution of ecosystem services have remained at a level consistent with the status of ecosystem services (Chen et al., 2022a ). Consistency in the spatial distribution patterns of ESSDG and six key ecosystem services was also found on the QTP. The variation in individual SDGs was due to differences in the weighting of different ecosystem service contributions to each SDG (Hu et al., 2022 ). Although Wood et al. (2018)  investigated worldwide expert perceptions of the weight of each ecosystem service's contribution to different SDGs, more refined quantification is needed to conduct region-specific studies on the contribution of ecosystem services to SDGs. For example, Yin et al. (2022)  used an expert questionnaire to investigate the contribution of SR as an ecosystem service to SDGs and found that it contributed significantly more to SDG6, SDG13 and SDG15 than to other SDGs. This was in contrast to the results of Chen et al. (2022a) , which were quantified in this study. The contribution of ecosystem services to each SDG needs to be improved in the future by further refining the weighting system when calculating SDG scores based on ecosystem services in different regions. Especially in the QTP, several ecosystem services provided by its natural ecosystems are extremely important for the livelihoods of local people and for regional ecological security (Zhang et al., 2021b ).  4.2 The role of EEPs and climate change in ESSDG Changes in the QTP ecosystems are influenced by two major factors—climate change and human activities—especially with regard to the improvement of vegetation and ecosystem services. These improvements are thought to be driven by a combination of climate warming and EEPs (Yu et al., 2023 ; Zhang et al., 2021b ). Our study found significant increases in several ecosystem services such as water production, SR, and NPP in the northeastern part of the plateau. The northeastern part of the plateau has shown a significant increase in precipitation in recent years, and the increase in precipitation directly contributed to an increase in water production and in vegetation cover, which in turn contributed to an increase in vegetation productivity (Huang et al., 2023 ). A study comparing changes in ecosystem services in different EEP areas found that EEPs on the QTP contributed to improved WY and SR (Ma et al., 2023 ). The most significant optimization of the contribution of ecosystem services to SDGs was produced in the northeastern part of the plateau in the context of increased precipitation and the implementation of EEPs. In addition, SR and carbon sequestration have been shown to bring more dimensions to the contribution to SDGs (Yin et al., 2021 ; Yin et al., 2023a ), not only in terms of significant improvements in our ESSDG. For the north–central region within the QTP, temperature has always been an important constraint on the growth of vegetation, and the increase in temperature in this region in recent years has promoted the recovery of regional vegetation. This has led to significant benefits from EEPs in the west–central region of the plateau (Ma et al., 2021 ), and has further contributed to the realization of the related SDGs. Combining climate trends and changes in ESSDG (Fig. 6 ; Fig. S5), it can be observed that most of north-central Tibet shows a decreasing trend in precipitation as well as areas of increasing temperatures, especially in Nagchu, where the ESSDG still shows an overall increasing trend against the backdrop of a climatic context of gradual drought. Although the regression analysis of the whole area did not reflect the contribution of temperature change to the ESSDG (Table S1), the dominant role of temperature on ecosystem sustainability in the north–central region is still present (Lehnert et al., 2016 ), and increasing temperature ensures the effectiveness of EEPs implementation in low-temperature constrained areas like the QTP. It is important to acknowledge the contribution of the EEPs implemented on the Tibetan Plateau to ecosystem improvement. Our study found that the trend of ESSDG change in the region where the fallow forest was implemented was different from that of climate change, which to some extent reflects the effectiveness of the project in improving the woodland ecosystem. The linear regression analysis also found that the improvement of ESSDG through the implementation of both the fallow forest and the fallow pasture projects was significant. In addition, some of the effects of the ecological restoration projects were offset by human activities and climate change impacts, and studies by Pan et al. (2022)  and Li et al. (2018)  showed that the implementation of the EEPs on the QTP offset to a certain extent the disturbances of human activities on the natural ecosystems in recent years and partially counteracted the unfavorable climate change impacts. Combining the spatial distribution of ESSDG and climate change, it can be found that in the region where two ecological restoration projects were implemented in the southeastern part of the plateau, ESSDG increased despite the decrease in precipitation in some areas, further suggesting that the joint implementation of the two EEPs improved regional ecosystems in the context of aridification. In addition, the implementation of EEPs on the QTP is mainly carried out in a localized point and line manner. Sun et al. (2020)  conducted a meta-analysis on the improvement of grassland by fencing and grazing ban projects on the QTP and reported that various sampling-based studies found significant improvements in grassland vegetation cover and diversity. Liu et al. (2022)  also found that the improvement of ecosystem services in north–central Tibet was better in the fenced-in areas than in the fenced-out areas, based on the more detailed spatial distribution of the fencing project. The distribution of EEPs in this study was in county administrative units. This spatial scale may have made it difficult to accurately quantify the differences between counties where EEPs were implemented and counties where they were not implemented. An accurate study using large-scale field sampling of EEPs and non-EEPs areas would be an effective means to further explore the ecosystem impacts of ecological project areas (Hong et al., 2023 ).  4.3 Sustainable ecosystem management after EEPs The follow-up management of artificial ecosystems after the implementation of EEPs is crucial for whether the projects promote sustainable development in the region. Our results did not show a significant effect of RGFGP on the realization of sustainable development goals, which may be due to the sensitivity of alpine grassland ecosystems to climate change on the one hand (Ran et al., 2019 ), and the need to improve the ecosystem management measures of the artificial grassland after the project on the other hand. For the new forest and grassland ecosystems after the EEPs, previous studies have shown that effective and appropriate ecosystem management measures will improve regional soil organic matter (Li et al., 2018 ; Zhu et al., 2021 ). For alpine ecosystems on the QTP, alpine grassland ecosystem service status has a significant effect, and seeding and cultivation measures taken in alpine grassland will improve grassland ecosystem service supply and trade-off relationships (Wu et al., 2017 ). In addition, fencing and grazing ban measures in alpine grassland also have significant improvement on vegetation growth condition (Sun et al., 2020 ). Therefore, site-specific and sustainable ecosystem management approaches are crucial for the future improvement of EEPs contributions to the SDGs on the QTP.  4.4 Limitations and future perspectives Ecosystem services contribute to each SDGs from multiple aspects. Here, we only adopted the method proposed by Chen et al. (2022a)  to calculate the contribution of ecosystem services to SDGs based on Wood et al. (2018)  expert research. Although this approach could effectively reflect the extent of the contribution of ecosystem services to SDGs and spatial and temporal differences, it can only be used as reference for macroscopic SDGs evaluation. The specific contribution of ecosystem services to SDGs requires a more complex and multidimensional framework. In addition, we used equal weights for the six ecosystem services in the calculation of ESSDG. Because the supply capacity of ecosystem services and the type and degree of impact on nature and society vary from place to place, expert interviews and questionnaire surveys can be conducted with relevant research experts and local managers in the region in future studies to form a QTP-oriented weighting of each ecosystem service contribution to the SDG evaluation score. Although EEPs on the QTP have made significant contributions to regional vegetation restoration, ecosystem service provision, and poverty alleviation among farmers and herders, and have become indispensable for achieving regional SDGs (Fan and Fang, 2022 ; Pan et al., 2023 ), evaluation studies of EEPs at a global scale have found that project implementation may bring about trade-offs in ecosystem services, overconsumption of water resources, and inequitable income for farmers (Feng et al., 2016 ; Jiang et al., 2020 ). The alpine ecosystem of the QTP is fragile and sensitive to human activities, and the structure and function of the natural ecosystems are difficult to repair once they are damaged (Sun et al., 2021 ). Therefore, timely and comprehensive assessment of EEPs, improvement of the dynamic adjustment mechanism of EEPs, and determination of the optimal implementation threshold and intensity, considering climate change and the overall conditions of regional ecosystems, are important safeguards to ensure that EEPs contribute to the SDGs of the Tibetan Plateau (Fan and Fang., 2022; Ma et al., 2021 ).   5 Conclusion Since 2000, several EEPs have been implemented on the QTP to restore degraded ecosystems. In addition, different climate changes have occurred in different parts of the plateau. Quantifying the changes in ecosystem services and their contributions to SDGs in the context of climate change and EEPs provides a reference for guiding the implementation of EEPs on the plateau in the future and ultimately achieving the region's SDGs. Overall, the level of ecosystem services in the counties of the QTP has risen since the implementation of the EEPs, especially WY, SP, SR, and FP. With regard to the relationship between ecosystem services, the relationship between supplying, regulating, and supporting ecosystem services was characterized by a stable overall synergy. There were trade-offs between SP and other ecosystem services, but these trade-offs are becoming smaller. The ESSDG calculated based on ecosystem services increased in 75.22% of counties between 2000 and 2020, reflecting the increasing contribution of ecosystem services to the SDGs process. The increase in ecosystem service supply and the synergistic relationship between ecosystem services contributed to the overall increase in plateau SDGs scores. Climate warming and wetting played a significant role in north–central Tibet and the eastern QTP, respectively, and the implementation of EEPs offset the adverse effects of drying climate in some areas and ensured the sustainability of ecosystem service delivery on the QTP.
