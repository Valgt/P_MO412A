                  Ecosystem carbon sequestration service (ECSS) is the benefits humans derive from the ecosystem carbon sequestration process, which is key to regulating climate, stabilising the natural foundation for development, and supporting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) achievement. However, how ECSS contributes to the SDGs still needs to be discovered. Here, based on downscaling localisation SDG indicators, regression methods, and mechanism analysis, we identified the contribution of ECSS to the SDGs, taking China's Loess Plateau (LP) region as an example. The results showed that the LP made higher progress on resource and environmental SDGs, such as SDGs 13, 12, 6, and 7 (climate, consumption and production, water, and energy) in the last two decades. As for the relationships between ECSS and SDGs, the progress of SDGs 6, 7, 13 and 15 (water, energy, climate, and ecosystems) showed positive linear responses to ECSS. The response of SDGs 1, 4, 8, and 12 (poverty reduction, education, economic growth, and consumption and production) to ECSS showed a threshold when the standardised ECSS value was 0.11. To improve ECSS for a more sustainable ecological foundation underpinning the SDGs, ECSS management should be improved to protect the ecosystem carbon pool and improve carbon sequestration function, as well as to promote the social-ecological co-benefits. This work links carbon sequestration service to sustainable development and can help in leveraging nature's contributions towards carbon neutrality and the 2030 Agenda.

However, how ECSS contributes to the SDGs still needs to be discovered. Here, based on downscaling localisation SDG indicators, regression methods, and mechanism analysis, we identified the contribution of ECSS to the SDGs, taking China's Loess Plateau (LP) region as an example. The results showed that the LP made higher progress on resource and environmental SDGs, such as SDGs 13, 12, 6, and 7 (climate, consumption and production, water, and energy) in the last two decades. As for the relationships between ECSS and SDGs, the progress of SDGs 6, 7, 13 and 15 (water, energy, climate, and ecosystems) showed positive linear responses to ECSS. The response of SDGs 1, 4, 8, and 12 (poverty reduction, education, economic growth, and consumption and production) to ECSS showed a threshold when the standardised ECSS value was 0.11. To improve ECSS for a more sustainable ecological foundation underpinning the SDGs, ECSS management should be improved to protect the ecosystem carbon pool and improve carbon sequestration function, as well as to promote the social-ecological co-benefits. This work links carbon sequestration service to sustainable development and can help in leveraging nature's contributions towards carbon neutrality and the 2030 Agenda.

In 2015, the United Nations (UN) adopted the 2030 Agenda with 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 nested targets (UN, 2015 ). The SDGs emphasise a path that integrates social, economic and environmental sustainability, acting as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect ecosystems, and promote prosperity for all by 2030 (UN, 2021 ; Yin et al., 2021 ). The SDGs provide global scholars and policymakers with a key research and development direction towards 2030. Studies have increasingly focused on the SDGs and their progress (Xu et al., 2020 ; Zhang et al., 2022c ), interactions (Fonseca et al., 2020 ), and driving mechanisms (Rosati and Faria, 2019 ; Yin et al., 2022b ). Given that natural resources and healthy ecosystems are fundamental to the SDG implementation, the ecosystem 's contributions to the SDGs are recognised as a vital issue in social-ecological studies (Nerini et al., 2019 ; Yin et al., 2022b ; Zhang et al., 2020 , 2022a ). Ecosystem carbon sequestration is an ecological process of capturing and fixing carbon dioxide in terrestrial ecosystems (MA, 2005 ). As one of the most critical ecosystem services, i.e., the benefits of nature to humans (MA, 2005 ; Yin et al., 2021 ), ecosystem carbon sequestration service (ECSS) refers to the benefits humans obtain from the carbon sequestration process (Li et al., 2019 ; Smith, 2016 ). ECSS supports the growth of aboveground vegetation and soil formation by forming carbon sinks. This maintains healthy ecosystems and brings multiple benefits, such as climate regulation, soil conservation and crop production (Amelung et al., 2020 ). ECSS has become a research priority in the context of global climate change and sustainable development agendas. Previous works on ECSS mainly focused on service assessment (Arowolo et al., 2018 ; Buckley and Chauvenet, 2021 ), trade-off and synergy assessment (Chen et al., 2019 ; Xu et al., 2022 ), supply and demand analysis (Feng et al., 2021 ; Zhai et al., 2021 ; Zhao et al., 2018b ), and scenario prediction (Bai et al., 2018 ; Gourevitch et al., 2021 ; Xu et al., 2022 ). The works have formed a framework that couples the ECSS supply from the natural system and demands from the human system (e.g., SDG achievement) (Zhao et al., 2018a ). In this framework, studies have preliminarily explored the relationship between ecosystem services and the SDGs based on expert questionnaires (Wood et al., 2018 ; Yang et al., 2020 ; Yin et al., 2022a ) and the number of words related to ESs in the sustainable development agenda documents (Geijzendorffer et al., 2017 ). Studies also discussed the paths integrating ECSS into SDG indicators that evaluate the ecosystem quality (SDG 15) (Groshans et al., 2018 ; Lorenz et al., 2019 ) and harnessing carbon sequestration service to advance SDGs (Lal, 2019 ). However, most studies link ECSS to climate-based solutions highlighting the importance of ecosystem carbon pools in tackling global warming and achieving carbon neutrality (Bossio et al., 2020 ; Lu et al., 2022 ; Stanley et al., 2018 ). Few studies have systematically analysed the contribution of carbon sequestration service to broader sustainability, i.e., SDG achievement. Linking ECSS from the natural dimension to sustainable development is critical to promote social-ecological sustainability (Zhao et al., 2020 ), also key to the policy formulation for ecosystem management and SDG implementation (Li et al., 2019 ; Mandle et al., 2021 ). As a key region for China's sustainable development, the Loess Plateau (LP) region is an important national ecological barrier and ecosystem service provider, as well as one of the areas with the most profound conflicts between population, resources and environment (Wu et al., 2019b , 2020 ). To restore ecosystems and secure people's livelihoods (Fu et al., 2017 ), the LP region has established large-scale ecological projects (e.g., “grain for green”, afforestation and reforestation) (Yu et al., 2020 ), which has significantly improved ECSS in the last decades (Ouyang et al., 2016 ). Accordingly, studies have increasingly focused on the coupled relationship between ecosystem services and socioeconomic development in the LP (Feng et al., 2021 ; Li et al., 2021 ; Xiao et al., 2022c ) and proposed optimisation frameworks for matching the supply and demand of ECSS (Feng et al., 2021 ; Zhai et al., 2021 ; Zhao et al., 2018b ). However, although scholars built an index system based on SDGs to evaluate the urban livability of the LP (Xiao et al., 2022b ), there are few studies comprehensively evaluating the SDG progress and coupling ECSS's contribution to the SDGs. How ECSS improvement contributes to regional SDG progress needs to be better understood. This work aims to analyse the contributions of ECSS to the SDG progress. We first evaluated the sustainable development progress of the LP region from 2000 to 2019 by constructing a downscaling localisation index system based on SDGs. Then we analysed the impacts of ECSS on the SDG progress using regression analysis and discussed the mechanism that ECSS contributes to SDGs. Our work highlights that promoting the SDG implementation needs to leverage ECSS's contribution towards carbon neutrality and sustainable development agendas.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study area The LP is located in north-central China (100.90°E−114.55°E, 33.72°N–41.27°N) and covers an area of about 640,000 km2 . It is high in the east and low in the west (Fig. 1  ) (Lu et al., 2021 ). The LP region, dominated by a temperate continental climate, has cold, dry winters and hot, rainy summers. Influenced by climate and topography, the vegetation on the LP, from forest to grassland, shows an evident horizontal zonal distribution from southeast to northwest (Li et al., 2017 ). The soil types also change from brown to eolian in the southeast-northwest direction. The LP is one of the most severely eroded area in the world. The area includes parts of the Chinese provinces of Gansu, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Ningxia, and Inner Mongolia. The socioeconomic development and ecosystem conditions of the LP region have undergone profound changes in recent decades (Wu et al., 2019b ). The high population growth, industrial production, resource exploitation, and urbanisation aggravate ecological risks such as soil erosion and vegetation degradation (Fu et al., 2017 ). On the other hand, the LP region has made remarkable achievements in ecosystem restoration by carrying out numerous ecological projects (Yu et al., 2020 ). It is one of the areas with the deepest contradiction between socioeconomic development and ecological security, also a key area to ensure national security of agriculture, energy and ecological barrier.  2.2 Data collection We collected SDG data of 44 cities in the LP region from 2000 to 2019, including 16 goals and 71 nested indicators. As the LP region is located inland and far from the sea, SDG 14 was not considered in this study. The data were mainly obtained from the National Statistical Yearbook (http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/ ), statistical yearbook and statistical bulletin of national economic and social development of 44 cities. Data sources are provided in the supplementary material (table S1 ). We used ECSS data for the LP region in 2010 obtained from the China Ecosystem Assessment (https://www.scidb.cn/en/detail?dataSetId=633694460865150976&version=V1&dataSetType=journal&tag=2&language=en_US ) (Ouyang et al., 2016 ).  2.3 Data analysis (1) Construct the index framework. We constructed a downscaling localisation index system based on the SDGs to assess the LP region's SDG progress. 1) SDG 1 consists of six indicators related to poverty incidence, urban and rural subsistence allowance and insurance. 2) SDG 2 includes six indicators related to food and output value of agriculture, forestry, husbandry, and fishery. 3) SDG 3 covers seven indicators related to health and human casualties. 4) SDG 4 includes five indicators related to quality education. 5) SDG 5 includes four indicators related to protecting women's rights. 6) SDG 6 includes four indicators related to water resources and sanitation. 7) SDG 7 includes three indexes related to energy. 8) SDG 8 includes five economic development and employment indicators. 9) SDG 9 includes eight innovation and network infrastructure indicators. 10) SDG 10 covers five indicators of the urban-rural development gap. 11) SDG 11 involves three indicators related to urbanisation and public facilities. 12) SDG 12 involves waste treatment and sustainable resource consumption. 13) SDG 13 involves four indicators of atmospheric environmental quality. 14) SDG 15 involves four indicators of ecological construction. 15) SDG 16 involves two indicators of government information disclosure and judicial justice. 16) SDG 17 involves two indicators related to foreign economic exchanges. SDG 14 was not considered in this study because the LP region is inland. Specific content and data sources of indicators are provided in the supplementary material (table S1 ).  (2) Evaluate the SDG index score. According to the method of the UN SDG assessment, we unified the attributes of indicators, standardised the data, and calculated the SDG score by the mean without weights for each city. To preprocess the data, we first distinguished the contribution direction of each indicator to sustainable development according to Zhang et al. (2022b) . A positive indicator means that the larger the data is, the more conducive to regional sustainable development; a negative indicator means that the smaller the data is, the more conducive to sustainable development. Then we scaled the data to 0–1 to compare indicators in different units (UN, 2021 ). We evaluated the sustainable development level of the LP region based on the SDG index scores. Under the SDG principles identified in the 2030 Agenda, social, economic and ecological development are indivisible and play an equally important role in the sustainable development agenda (UN, 2015 , 2020 ). Therefore, 17 SDGs were assigned the same weight in this study. As the number of specific indicators under each SDG is different, weights are assigned to indicators under each SDG according to arithmetic average equal weight. That is, the more the number of indicators, the smaller the weight of every indicator. Then we calculated the average of the corresponding indicators for each goal as the SDG index score.  (3) ECSS evaluation and zonal statistics. We extracted the ECSS data within the LP region from the China Ecosystem Assessment and calculated the mean ECSS value for each city using the Zonal Statistics tool in ArcGIS 10.6. The China Ecosystem Assessment quantified ecosystem service provision using data from different sources, including multisource satellite images, recorded biophysical data, field surveys, and special assessments from several government ministries (Ouyang et al., 2016 ). Carbon sequestration refers to the carbon sequestered by terrestrial ecosystems. Carbon storage represents the result of carbon sequestration, which refers to carbon accumulation in ecosystems. The ecosystem biomass carbon storage (BCSin ) was calculated based on the following formula (Ouyang et al., 2016 ):   (1) B C S  i n   = ∑ j = 1  n  ( B i j   × C C  i   )  × A R × 10 − 6       Where Bij   (in t/km2 ) is the biomass density of ecosystem i  (forest, shrubland, grassland) in pixel j  in the year 2010. CCi   is the carbon content in the biomass of forest (0.5), wetland (0.5), and grassland (0.45). AR  is the area of each pixel which is 0.0625 km2 . The average annual ecosystem carbon sequestration was calculated based on the ecosystem biomass carbon storage as the following formula:(2) A C S = ∑ B C S  i 2010   − ∑ B C S  i 2000       where ACS (in t/km2 ) is the average annual carbon sequestration of ecosystem i  (forest, shrubland, grassland). The ECSS of the LP showed the same spatial distribution as those assessed in other studies that used net primary productivity to represent the ECSS (Wang et al., 2022b ; Wu et al., 2019a ).(4) Identify the response of SDG progress to ECSS. We performed linear fitting on the relationship between ECSS and SDGs, and selected statistically significant fitting results (p < 0.05). Excluding the goals significantly related to ECSS (p < 0.05), piecewise linear fitting was performed for the remaining goals that failed the significance test to identify the threshold of the ECSS-SDGs relationship. Then we identified the areas beside the threshold respectively. The relationship between ECSS and SDGs was also identified the nonlinear trends fitted by locally weighted regression.      3 Results 3.1 SDG index scores and ECSS distribution in the Loess Plateau The 20-year average index score of the 16 SDGs in the LP region was unevenly distributed between 11 and 83 (Fig. 2  a). The SDGs that made outstanding progress were SDGs 13 and 12 (climate, consumption and production), with SDG index scores of 77 and 66, respectively. SDGs 6, 7, 1, and 4 (water, energy, poverty alleviation, and education) also showed advanced progress, with the SDG index scores exceeding 50. However, progress toward SDGs 9 and 17 (industry, partnerships) lagged behind other goals, with SDG index scores of less than 20. The SDG progress showed  uneven distribution spatially, with the 20-year average SDG index scores higher in the east and lower in the west. The cities with high SDG index scores were scattered in the LP region. Xi'an, Taiyuan, Zhengzhou, Lanzhou and Ordos, the capitals of Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan and Gansu provinces, respectively, made the greatest progress in sustainable development, with the 20-year SDG index score above 40. The lower SDG index scores fallen in Haibei, Hainan, Haidong, Huangnan, Dingxi, and Xinzhou, and these cities were mainly distributed in Qinghai, Gansu, and Shanxi provinces. Overall, the cities with a low level of sustainable development were scattered in the central part of the LP region and contiguous in the western area (Fig. 2 b). The spatial distribution of ECSS was also uneven in the LP region. The high ECSS values were clustered in the east and south of the LP region (including Changzhi and Sanmenxia cities). In contrast, the central and northwest of the LP region were concentrated in large areas with low ECSS values (especially around Erdos and Yulin). In the southeast, ECSS with low value was distributed along construction land and the Yellow River (including Weinan, Yan'an, and Lvliang cities) (Fig. 3  ).  3.2 Regression analysis of SDG progress and ECSS Five of the 17 SDGs showed a statistically significant linear response to ECSS. SDGs 6, 13 and 15 (goals related to water, climate, and ecosystem) had a significant positive relationship with ECSS. In contrast, SDGs 7 and 17 (goals related to energy and partnerships) had a negative relationship with ECSS (Fig. 4  ). In addition to the goals showing a significant linear relationship with ECSS, piecewise linear fitting was performed for the remaining targets. The results showed that SDGs 1, 4, 8 and 12 (goals related to poverty, education, economic growth, and consumption) had consistent thresholds for ECSS (Fig. 4 ). When the standardised carbon sequestration value is 0.11, the SDG index scores on both sides of the threshold showed different responses to ECSS. To the left of the ECSS threshold (i.e., ECSS <0.11), SDGs 1, 4, 8 and 12 showed a positive linear response to ECSS, while no significant linear relationship with ECSS existed when the standardised carbon sequestration value was larger than 0.11. We identified the actual ECSS value corresponding to the threshold and identified the regions besides the threshold (Fig. 5  ). The results showed that the area smaller than the threshold occupies most of the LP region, and the land use type is mainly grassland, cultivated land and construction land. The areas larger than the spatial threshold are concentrated on the east side of the LP region, where mountains and forests are widely distributed (Figs. 5  and 1 ).   4 Discussion Understanding the role of ECSS in driving SDG progress is important for developing strategies to promote social-ecological sustainability. Our study provides new insights into the sustainable development status of the LP and regional social-ecological sustainability through the lens of coupling ECSS and SDGs. Drought, soil erosion, deforestation, and over-reclamation have caused the LP's deepest social-ecological contradiction and long-restricted regional  sustainable development (Yu et al., 2020 ). In this context, large-scale ecosystem  restoration projects (e.g., Grain for Green) have been implemented in the LP region in the past two decades (Wu et al., 2019b ). They generated multiple benefits, such as improving vegetation coverage, conserving soil and water, regulating climate, and reducing natural disasters (Fu et al., 2017 ; Zheng et al., 2019 ). Therefore, SDG 13 (climate) and SDG 6 (water) have made significant progress in the LP region since 2000. Ecological projects also promote the optimisation of industrial structure (e.g., ecological economy), improve the quality of air, water and soil, and popularise clean energy (e.g., solar energy and natural gas). Therefore, advanced progress has been made in promoting SDGs 12, 7, and 1, which relate to sustainable production and consumption, energy, food and agriculture (Gajula and Reddy, 2021 ; Li et al., 2021 ; Xia et al., 2022 ). SDGs 9 and 17 (industry andinnovation, partnerships) made less progress in the LP region. The lagged industrial modernisation and innovation, along with the insufficient transformation and upgrading of traditional primary and resource-dependent industries, led to backward progress on SDG 9. The inland condition of the LP region, with limited international economic exchanges and transport accessibility, has limited progress towards Goal 17 for most cities except provincial capitals (e.g., Xi'an and Zhengzhou) (Fig. 2 a). The spatial differentiation of sustainable development progress in the LP region is driven by multiple factors such as natural endowment, economic development, and macro policy (Lu et al., 2012 ; Wu et al., 2019b ). The observed SDG progress and its spatial variance partially coincide with the findings of other studies. Previous studies evaluated the urban livability of the LP based on the SDG indicator framework. They found that provincial capitals such as Ordos, Taiyuan, and Yinchuan showed a high level of livability in terms of the living environment, technology, and infrastructure due to their economic advantages (Xiao et al., 2022a , 2022b ). Economic status is a prerequisite for sustainable development, reflected in the high SDG index scores of provincial cities in our results, leading to spatial differentiation of SDG progress on the LP. The provincial capital cities, with a high level of economic development and transportation accessibility, are sinks of labour, capital and resources. Their strong economic base can provide financial support for constructing sustainable urban systems in terms of education, social protection, health care and infrastructure, as well as trade and supply of resources such as food, energy, and water (Pereira and Baro, 2022 ). However, underdeveloped areas often rely on the occupation and utilisation of ecosystems (e.g., deforestation for farming) to meet the population's livelihood. Land degradation, such as soil erosion and vegetation degradation, will further deepen the contradiction between economic development and ecological security, affecting the SDG implementation. The cities with a low level of sustainable development are scattered in the central region and contiguous in the western region of the LP. Geographical conditions such as topography and landform play an important role in indicating the regional ecological carrying capacity and industrial layout of the LP region. In the southwest hilly and gully mountainous region, landforms are seriously fragmented, which limits infrastructure construction and the flow of population, materials and capital. The plain valley region along the Yellow River, with fertile land and sound resource endowment, attracts the agglomeration of population and production activities. Therefore, the central and eastern regions of the LP region show better sustainable development progress (Fig. 2 b). The ECSS-SDGs relationships represented by our results partially coincide with the existing findings from different perspectives but unify them into the core issue of social-ecological sustainability. Previous studies have revealed the ecological mechanisms by which ECSS affects SDGs. For example, land use change can influence the achievement of multiple SDGs by regulating the supply of ecosystem services, especially SDGs 15, 11, 2 (ecosystems, cities, and agriculture) (Wang et al., 2022a ). In addition, ecosystem restoration can support the realisation of SDGs 6, 13 and 15 by restoring the carbon sequestration capacity and coordinating the water-food-energy-ecosystem nexus (Yao et al., 2021 ). Our results show that ECSS is positively associated with SDGs 6, 13, and 15 (goals related to water, climate, and ecosystem). To the left of the ECSS threshold, SDGs 1, 4, 8, and 12 (goals related to poverty, education, economy and production) also showed a positive linear response to ECSS (Fig. 3 ). This is because ECSS can deliver benefits such as supporting agriculture, regulating water and air quality, and conserving habitat for biodiversity, with social benefits in livelihoods and ecological education (Chu et al., 2019 ; Li et al., 2019 ). To clarify the mechanism that ECSS contributes to the SDGs, we identified the goals and targets whose implementation is contributed by ECSS by sorting synergistic relationships among ecosystem services, the UN definition of each SDG, and literature evidence (Fig. 6  ; Table 1  ). ECSS's contribution to SDGs is achieved mainly by supporting multiple ecosystem services and maintaining planetary boundaries to implement the multidimensional goals included in SDGs. As a critical supporting service, ECSS sequesters the carbon that underpins the formation of soil and biomass (Zhang et al., 2022d ), thus supporting the supply of other ecosystem services. ECSS supports, firstly, regulating services (e.g., climate regulation) through carbon fixation, as well as provisioning services (e.g., crop, fibre, wood, and medicine production) through biomass accumulation (Xia et al., 2022 ). The healthy ecosystems supported by ECSS also satisfy the cultural services that human beings obtain from nature, such as ecotourism, aesthetic appreciation and ecological education (Fig. 6 ). In addition, the area with high ECSS is usually the forested mountains in the southeast LP, where characterised with the low level of population density, transportation accessibility and urbanisation, leading to limited energy demand and international trade. Therefore, SDGs 7, 17 (energy and international partnership) are negatively correlated with ECSS (Fig. 4 ). In addition to the SDGs directly affected by ECSS in our statistical analysis, ECSS also contributes to other goals based on literature evidence (Table 1 ). ECSS first provides key climate regulation service to combat climate change (SDG 13, climate). Vegetation (aboveground biomass) and soil (soil organic carbon, SOC) are the major carbon sequestration sectors in terrestrial ecosystems (e.g., forests, shrublands, grasslands, wetlands and croplands) (Lu et al., 2018 ; Tang et al., 2018 ) (Fig. 6 ). Abundant biomass and fertile soils can support healthy terrestrial ecosystems and coastal ecosystems (SDGs 14, 15) and regulate the water cycle along with the carbon cycle (SDG 6, water). The crop biomass harvested can provide food, and SOC can maintain soil fertility and reduce soil erosion, thus underpinning sustainable agriculture for food security (SDG 2, food) and poverty alleviation (SDG 1, no poverty). Biomass storing carbon provides the raw material for bioenergy and biochar (e.g., wood and crop residues) (Kobayashi and Nakajima, 2021 ), which facilitates energy sustainability and resource reuse (SDG 7, energy; SDG 12, consumption and production) (Gajula and Reddy, 2021 ). Carbon sequestration in urban and rural ecosystems provides inhabitable environmental conditions for residents (SDG 11, cities), which is conducive to human physical and mental health and well-being (SDG 3, health). For the climate change mitigation and net-zero emissions agenda, putting a value on ECSS and incorporating it into carbon trading markets can facilitate the development of low-carbon industries and green economies (SDG 8, economic growth; SDG 9, industry) (Chu et al., 2019 ) (Table 1 ). The linear responses of SDGs 1, 4, 8 and 12 to the ECSS change showed a threshold. The area with an ECSS value smaller than the threshold, where the ECSS impact on SDGs was statistically significant (Fig. 5 ), occupies most of the LP region. It is mainly covered with grassland, cultivated land, and construction land (Fig. 1 ). This indicates that ECSS supports the SDG realisation in most of the LP region, where socioeconomic sustainability is closely related to carbon sequestration service. The area with an ECSS value larger than the threshold is mainly concentrated on the east side of the LP region, where mountains and forests are widely distributed. Here, forest management is focused on conserving ecosystem functions with low urbanisation and population concentration levels. ECSS's contribution to SDGs 1, 4, 8 and 12 indicates the importance of carbon sequestration in promoting environmentally friendly consumption (SDG 12), creating income opportunities for rural land owners (SDG 1) by land-management strategies (e.g., afforestation and reforestation), and promoting financial transfers under global carbon market (SDG 8) (Kim and Huh, 2020 ; Smith et al., 2019 ). Local communities could also have quality education (SDG 4) under sound social-ecological circumstances. Moreover, ECSS also contributes to the co-progress of social, economic and ecological SDGs through the synergy among ecosystem services (Ouyang et al., 2016 ; Smith et al., 2019 ; Wood et al., 2018 ). This study provides evidence that ecosystem carbon sequestration contributes to sustainable development in food security, water conservation and climate change mitigation. It can help to identify priority areas for implementing ecological projects to improve carbon sequestration for social-ecological sustainability. Although this study innovatively focuses on the importance of carbon sequestration for sustainable development, there are still limitations in the data availability. For the spatial scale of evaluation, the SDG data was available for cities. ECSS was evaluated based on the amount of carbon sequestration in forest, shrubland and grassland at a finer resolution. For the uniform resolution of ECSS and SDGs data, we performed zonal statistics on ECSS data to convert them into city-level resolution. However, upscaling may average out the subtle changes in ECSS in space. For future research, the SDG data can be converted into a finer resolution through downscaling or data assimilation, which can reflect nature's contribution to the SDGs more accurately.  5 Conclusions ECSS can support social-ecological sustainability by regulating climate, forming biomass and increasing soil organic matter, providing a stable and resilient ecological basis for sustainable development. Using downscaling localisation SDG indicators, regression methods, and mechanism analysis, this work systematically evaluated the SDG progress and examined how ECSS contributes to the SDG progress in the LP region. Results showed that ECSS could facilitate the implementation of multiple SDGs, but there is a threshold for the ECSS-SDGs relationship. To promote the SDG implementation, ECSS management should be improved to protect the ecosystem carbon pools, improve carbon sequestration function and achieve coordinated social, economic and environmental benefits. Our work provides a new insight that ECSS underpins the SDG implementation, which can help to leverage nature's contribution to people towards carbon neutrality and the 2030 Agenda.
