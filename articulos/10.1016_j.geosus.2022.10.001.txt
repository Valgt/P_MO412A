                  Urbanization and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are important global issues in the current “Anthropocene”. Climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated global urban problems and hindered the ability to meet SDGs on time, while the broad interlinkages between urbanization and the SDGs remain poorly understood. This study shows that among the interlinkages of urbanization with 17 SDGs, synergies are observed with 151 targets (89%), among which 67 (40%) have stronger synergies, and trade-offs are observed with 66 targets (39%), among which 31 (18%) have stronger trade-offs. Furthermore, the synergies and trade-offs between urbanization and the achievement of SDGs are specifically analyzed based on four fundamental interaction fields: (a) public health and social welfare equality; (b) energy consumption and economic growth; (c) natural resource use and ecological/environmental impacts; and (d) international cooperation for development. Finally, based on these analyses, we propose four recommendations for sustainable urbanization, including (a) shared well-being and spatial justice for urban and rural residents; (b) guiding green and low-carbon urban development; (c) building resilient cities; and (d) promoting multilateral cooperation in cities, which can contribute to the achievement of SDGs by 2030.

Climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated global urban problems and hindered the ability to meet SDGs on time, while the broad interlinkages between urbanization and the SDGs remain poorly understood. This study shows that among the interlinkages of urbanization with 17 SDGs, synergies are observed with 151 targets (89%), among which 67 (40%) have stronger synergies, and trade-offs are observed with 66 targets (39%), among which 31 (18%) have stronger trade-offs. Furthermore, the synergies and trade-offs between urbanization and the achievement of SDGs are specifically analyzed based on four fundamental interaction fields: (a) public health and social welfare equality; (b) energy consumption and economic growth; (c) natural resource use and ecological/environmental impacts; and (d) international cooperation for development. Finally, based on these analyses, we propose four recommendations for sustainable urbanization, including (a) shared well-being and spatial justice for urban and rural residents; (b) guiding green and low-carbon urban development; (c) building resilient cities; and (d) promoting multilateral cooperation in cities, which can contribute to the achievement of SDGs by 2030.

To achieve these goals, promoting the sustainability of the social, economic, and ecological dimensions is important for guiding the international community towards future sustainable development (Fu et al., 2019 ). Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic and reverse globalization, cities play an even more important role in achieving SDGs and realizing responses to climate change and biodiversity loss (Chow et al., 2022 ; Morecroft et al., 2022 ). Currently, 55% of the world’s population resides in cities, and this value is expected to increase to 60% by 2030 and 65% by 2050. Nearly 90% of the future urbanization growth is projected to occur in developing countries across Asia and Africa, and the scale and speed of urbanization has been unprecedented to date (Chen et al., 2014 ; United Nations, 2019 ). To ensure sustainable global prosperity, unsustainable conditions generated by the relationship between humans and the environment under current urbanization conditions must be understood from different perspectives and at multiple scales (Fu et al., 2021 ; Hoekstra and Wiedmann, 2014 ). Cities have critical direct and indirect global impacts on energy use (Madlener and Sunak, 2011 ), land use, climate change (Seto and Shepherd, 2009 ), and resource consumption (Gondhalekar and Ramsauer, 2017 ). However, cities promote innovation and sustainable planning, and they are involved in the local governance of infrastructure, economies, and resource management (Appio et al., 2019 ), which is a key point for achieving transformative solutions for global sustainable development (Elmqvist et al., 2019 ; Scoones et al., 2020 ). Urbanization refers to the transformation of human production and lifestyles from rural to urban areas, including population concentration, non-agricultural activities, and drastic landscape changes (Antrop, 2004 ; Friedmann, 2006 ; Zhang, 2008 ). Its processes are generally recognized as an ensemble of multi-dimensional evolution, and the allocation of spatial elements has led to changes in models of economic growth, lifestyle, and values and reshaped regional development and land use, which have affected and altered the social and natural environment (Tonne et al., 2021 ). Urbanization is a matter of great concern in both developed and developing countries. Urban areas have greater access to employment opportunities, modern facilities, and social services, and their positive significance is widely recognized and essential for sustaining social progress and improving living conditions (Gong et al., 2012 ; Chen et al., 2018 ). However, urbanization also has negative repercussions on social equity, public health, animal habitats, and the environment, especially in rapidly urbanizing developing countries (Reckien et al., 2017 ; Gu, 2019 ). Achieving SDGs involves many issues and challenges. Across SDGs, interlinked effects may be observed, which are described as synergies or trade-offs (Kroll et al., 2019 ). Synergies arise from two mutually enhancing goals in terms of their respective achievements, whereas trade-offs between goals occur when the achievement of one goal is achieved at the detriment of another goal. Several scientific studies have examined the interlinkages between SDGs (Fu et al., 2019 ), including climate action (Fuso Nerini et al., 2019 ), energy systems (Fuso Nerini et al., 2018 ), environmental hygiene (Parikh et al., 2021 ), food security (Giannetti et al., 2020 ), and ecological security (Maes et al., 2019 ). These studies often focus on specific SDGs. Urbanization, as a complex systemic process of urban-rural transformation, involves various components, such as humans, land, environment, technology, and management (Bai et al., 2016 ). Unreasonable and rapid urbanization processes can severely degrade the socioeconomic ecosystem services of the region, resulting in the loss of agricultural land (He et al., 2014 ) and biodiversity (Sanderson et al., 2018 ). However, urbanization also facilitates the flow of resources, information, and knowledge creation is recognized (Bettencourt et al., 2007 ; Chua et al., 2019 ). The densification of land use accompanying urbanization can effectively increase resource-use efficiency (Wang, 2020 ). However, few studies have systematically addressed the interlinkages between urbanization and the achievement of these SDGs. SDG11 (sustainable cities and communities), which was established by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015, has been commonly referred to as an essential goal for sustainable urbanization (Akuraju et al., 2020 ; Ghani et al., 2020 ), although it fails to explore the synergies and trade-offs between urbanization and the multiple goals in SDGs. Numerous studies (Anwar et al., 2022 ; He et al., 2022 ; Xu et al., 2022 ; Zhao et al., 2022 ) have confirmed that the connotation and scope of action of urbanization are not only equivalent to SDG11 but also have interlinkages with other SDGs. Urbanization is an important and comprehensive geographic process on the land surface, and the interaction mechanism between humans and nature is complex (Fu et al., 2021 ). Here, we systematically analyze and generalize the synergies and trade-offs in the interlinkages between urbanization and all SDGs. Then, we focus on the pathways of the synergies and trade-offs between urbanization and SDGs based on the four fundamental interaction fields across them. We believe that this analysis can provide comprehensive cognitive information for achieving SDGs, thereby enabling researchers and policy makers to gain a more comprehensive understanding of how urbanization will affect the SDGs and ultimately strengthening associated actions and decisions for medium- or long-term global sustainable development. Concerns about sustainable urbanization will influence whether the world moves towards sustainable development in terms of social, economic, resource, ecological, and environmental aspects (Chen et al., 2021 ), and they provide a well-focused perspective for implementing most of the SDGs.  2 Materials and methods To understand the interlinkages (synergies and trade-offs) between urbanization and the 17 UN SDGs, which involve 169 specific targets on the 2030 sustainable development agenda, we referred to Nerini et al.’s methodology to identify interlinkages with the SDGs (Fuso Nerini et al., 2018 ). The synergies and trade-offs were identified based on a literature review combined with a consensus-based assessment. The Google Scholar search engine was used to filter published research in peer-reviewed journals or authoritative public reports from official organizations (such as UN reports). The relevant arguments or descriptions of real-world experiences about the interlinkage between urbanization and the respective SDG in the above literature and reports were considered ‘evidence’ of the existence of the interlinkages (synergies or trade-offs). Moreover, we only considered whether an interlinkage occurred between urbanization and the specific targets in the SDGs; thus, we did not consider the interactions between the separate goals of the SDGs. Potential interactions that determine whether the achievement of the SDG is closely related to or contributes to the achievement of another goal may occur. Moreover, the interlinkages between urbanization and the SDGs are fundamentally influenced by regional heterogeneity in geographic location, government governance, and science and technology. We consider three levels of interlinkages between urbanization and SDGs: interlinkage (+), strong interlinkage (++), and no interlinkage. These interlinkages indicate that urbanization could facilitate (synergies +) or disturb (trade-offs +) the achievement of a specific goal. Furthermore, a strong interlinkage means a closer direct actuation, which can be either positive or negative. For instance, strong interlinkage of synergies (synergies ++) with urbanization could directly create conditions that facilitate the achievement of a specific goal, and strong interlinkage of trade-offs (trade-offs ++) with urbanization indicates that urbanization might fail to achieve a specific goal or could even deteriorate it. No interlinkage indicates no significant relationship between urbanization and a specific target or the lack of either a positive or negative relationship. The process framework for identifying the interlinkage between urbanization and each specific goal is shown in Fig. 1  . During the whole review process, we searched the literature based on terms related to urbanization, including “urbanization”, “urbanicity”, “urbanism”, “urban”, and “rural”, which were combined with the specific descriptors of the respective SDG target. Based on arguments or facts found in the literature and reports combined with the expertise of our panelist, we discuss the direction of the role of the interlinkages between urbanization and SDG targets and determine whether they become stronger. Furthermore, we focus on a range of negative impacts in the context of climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings help to better understand the interlinkages between urbanization and SDGs in the current context.  3 Results and discussion Among all the specific targets, we found synergies between 151 (89%) targets and urbanization, with 67 (40%) targets having stronger synergies. These synergies involve 17 SDGs and cover topics such as poverty eradication, freedom from hunger, infrastructure, energy consumption, environmental protection, and international cooperation. The identification of trade-offs showed that 66 targets (39%) had trade-offs with urbanization, among which 31 (18%) were assessed to have stronger trade-offs. Moreover, trade-offs were observed between the 13 SDGs and urbanization. However, trade-offs were not observed between urbanization and the following two themes: SDG4 (quality education) and SDG5 (gender equality). A total of 62 (37%) targets had both synergies and trade-offs, with 23 (14%) of these targets presenting stronger relationships (both stronger synergies and trade-offs), which is worth noting. These targets mainly include SDG11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG12 (responsible consumption and production), and SDG15 (life on land). Urbanization contributes more significantly to and worsens the achievement of these targets, which is largely related to the sustainability of the actual development path of urbanization in each region (Zhao et al., 2022 ; Zimmerer et al., 2021 ). Compared to trade-offs, urbanization has more and stronger synergistic effects on SDGs. To some extent, this finding suggests that urbanization is one of the most effective levers for achieving SDGs. Our arguments are based on current expert knowledge of urbanization supplemented by evidence from relevant peer-reviewed literature. The complete evaluation results are comprehensively reported in the Appendix and visualized in Fig. 2  . We further explore the synergistic and tradeoff pathways and impact mechanisms between urbanization and SDGs according to the following four key interaction dimensions: (a) public health and social welfare equality; (b) economic growth and energy consumption; (c) natural resource use and ecological/environmental impacts; and (d) international cooperation for development. Fig.3   illustrates these four interaction fields between urbanization and SDGs. 3.1 Public health and social welfare equality Cities have better employment opportunities and incomes and better access to education and health resources than rural areas (Galea et al., 2005 ). Urbanization not only produces changes in the surrounding natural environment and the internal built-up area but also affects and changes the lifestyle and behavior of residents (Wang and Cao, 2017 ). Urbanization improves the health and life expectancy of residents by enhancing health awareness, increasing healthcare resources, improving health insurance systems, and investing in public health infrastructure (Lu et al., 2017 ). Effective governance can reduce health risks faced by the public (Coovadia et al., 2009 ). Death rates of related communicable and non-communicable diseases continue to decline over time as urbanization levels advance (M. Liu et al., 2017 ). Globally, except for sub-Saharan Africa, a significant negative correlation is observed between adult mortality and urbanization (Brueckner, 2019 ). From a dialectical perspective, urbanization improves the quality of life and accessibility of health services for urban dwellers; however, as rural dwellers continue to migrate rapidly to cities, aggressive urbanization will generate various problems, such as urban traffic congestion, increased infectious morbidity, and inadequate supply of urban medical and public hygiene infrastructure, which poses serious threats to public health in cities. Unfortunately, huge adverse impacts on public health caused by large-scale industrialization, such as air and water pollution, have already emerged. Increasing evidence has shown that chronic diseases are linked to environmental pollution (Rahman et al., 2021 ) and have become the largest cause of disease and death in low- and middle-income countries (Landrigan and Fuller, 2015 ). Urbanization-induced migration of poor rural dwellers has led to unplanned and spontaneous fragmentated expansion from cities to peripheral areas, thus leading to the emergence of informal settlements facing severe poverty, lack of public sanitation, safe drinking water, and high levels of environmental pollution (Aliu et al., 2021 ). The number of people living in informal settlements in 2020 exceeded one billion, and these settlements were mainly distributed in Central and South Asia (359 million), East and Southeast Asia (306 million), and sub-Saharan Africa (230 million), thus accounting for approximately 85% of the world’s slum dwellers (Sachs et al., 2022 ). Poverty forces inhabitants of informal settlements to make a living through the destruction of natural and ecologically sensitive areas, such as informal economic activities and urban agriculture (Cobbinah et al., 2015 ). Such extreme inequalities threaten the urban environment, natural resources, public health, and social cohesion. The continuing COVID-19 pandemic has acted as a wake-up call regarding the urban built environment and associated health and well-being of residents, and it has also created new demands (Coccia, 2022 ). City managers need to rethink the built environment and related public health concepts, including the accelerating climate crisis, air pollution, inadequate sanitation, clean water, and unsafe urban environments. In addition, co-designers (architects and urban planners), epidemiologists, and physicians are capable of strengthening actions and policies that will transform cities so that they are more health-conscious and protective of public welfare.  3.2 Economic growth and energy consumption Energy is the main driving force of economic development, and urbanization accelerates economic growth by increasing the scale of energy consumption and improving the consumption structure of the population (Wang et al., 2016 ). Moreover, urbanization-based agglomeration and scale effects stimulate further concentration of economic industries and rural populations, thereby intensifying large-scale energy consumption (Wu et al., 2019 ). Cities consume 60%–80% of the global primary energy consumption around the world (Poponi et al., 2016 ). However, over the long term, urbanization leads to compact spatial forms and higher population densities and thus can simultaneously increase the efficiency of resource and energy use, thereby reducing the total energy consumption (Poumanyvong and Kaneko, 2010 ). Specifically, through compact spatial forms and higher population densities, urbanization addresses the energy inefficiencies associated with decentralization of the rural population. Centralized heating and cooling may help reduce the energy consumption of residents, especially as the spatial spillover effects generated in green cities are more effective in further reducing energy consumption in surrounding areas (Y. Liu et al., 2017 ). In addition, energy efficiency can be improved based on technological advances and “deindustrialization” trend of the economy, which corresponds to decreases the share of primary industries and increases in the share of secondary and tertiary industries. Thus, the resource allocation and economic structure of cities are adjusted to reduce energy consumption (Zhao and Tang, 2018 ). In 2018, global industry (excluding the non-combustion use of fuels) consumed approximately 45% of energy resources, with 29% consumed by residential and commercial buildings and 21% consumed by transport (Cozzi et al., 2020 ). Accompanied by rising incomes and increased purchasing power, urbanization has stimulated carbon emissions from the residential and commercial building sectors. The transport sector represents a main consumer of global energy because of the significant increase in energy consumption due to inter-urban transport, increased private car usage, and traffic congestion (Adams et al., 2020 ). A certain level of uncoordinated urbanization is accompanied by congestion among the urban population, waste of public resources, and increased consumer demand by residents. Under these circumstances, urbanization may have the far more negative effects on energy consumption than the positive effects observed with an optimized energy mix. Globally, more than 700 million people still lacked access to electricity in 2020, with more than three-quarters living in sub-Saharan Africa (Sachs et al., 2022 ). COVID-19 caused the worst worldwide economic crisis in 2020, although the global economy began to rebound in 2021. The pandemic also led to unprecedented volatile changes in labor productivity levels, with an unemployment rate of 6.2% in 2021, which is still higher than the pre-pandemic rate of 5.4% (Sachs et al., 2022 ). Unfortunately, COVID-19 has not slowed the planet’s climate warming. The temporary slowdown in the global economy in the wake of the sudden events of the pandemic, which was followed by the rapid recovery in CO2  emissions, did not meet the Paris Agreement target of limiting global warming to 1.5°C (Matthews and Wynes, 2022 ). Regarded as a key driver of global economic growth, urbanization must shift towards ‘clean, compact and connected’ (CCC), which emphasizes the urgent need for green economic development and a clean energy transition (Hepburn et al., 2021 ).  3.3 Natural resource use and ecological/environmental impacts The transformation of the Earth’s surface into impermeable surfaces by urbanization is one of the most important human impacts on the biosphere (van Vliet, 2019 ). Rapidly increasing urbanization has accelerated the exploitation of natural resources beyond the renewable capacity of ecosystems (He et al., 2017 ). As the global ecological footprint (ECF) continues to increase, the biological carrying capacity decreases, which causes an ecological deficit. In 2017, the world average EFC was 2.77 global hectares (gha) per capita (a global total of 12 billion gha), and the average biological carrying capacity was only 1.60 gha per capita, resulting in a global ecological deficit of 117 million gha per capita (Ecological Footprint by Country, 2022 ). Most countries are currently facing ecological deficits, and more than 80% of the world’s population has been affected (Global Footprint Network, 2022 ). In addition, as global resource extraction rose from 27 billion tons to 92 billion tons per year between 1970 and 2017, the use of natural resources has grown across the board, including metallic minerals, non-metallic minerals, fossil fuels, biomass, water, and land (Oberle et al., 2019 ). The development model of urbanization relies on the extraction, trade, and processing of natural resources and waste products. There are two main drivers of growth in global natural resource consumption: massive infrastructure development during urbanization in developing countries and importation of natural resources and raw materials from developing countries to developed countries and outsourcing of raw material extraction and energy-intensive production sectors. In 2008, the per capita material footprint of consumption in high-income countries was 60% higher than that in high-middle-income countries and 13 times higher than that in low-income countries. The current path of global urbanization, which has occurred in large part through international trade in resources, shifts the risk of the ecological and environmental impacts of resource consumption from high-income to low- and middle-income consuming countries. From the perspective of sustainable development, the environmental pollution, climate change, and ecological degradation associated with urbanization have been widely discussed worldwide (He et al., 2017 ; Liu et al., 2019 ). Current irrational urbanization has accelerated the loss of black land (Li et al., 2017 ), frequency of extreme weather (Li et al., 2022 ), alterations to biogeochemical and hydrological cycle processes (Zhang et al., 2018 ), destruction of natural habitats, and reduction of biodiversity (Sanderson et al., 2018 ). The impacts of cities on ecological and environmental factors greatly exceed those of urban areas. Urban areas affect precipitation patterns by altering land use structures at scales of thousands of square kilometers (Seto and Shepherd, 2009 ), while the direct loss of vegetation biomass is also accompanied by imbalances in the carbon and nitrogen cycles of atmospheric circulation, which is followed by a range of global climate changes (Sokolov et al., 2008 ; Zaehle and Dalmonech, 2011 ). The scope and scale of these impacts have yet to be fully studied and understood. However, because urban socio-economic systems are built on ecosystems, the functional value of ecosystem services and biodiversity need to be considered during urban development planning. Ecosystem services in cities can help stabilize regional microclimates, improve air quality, and mitigate the effects of exposure to extreme temperatures and rainfall events (Gebre and Gebremedhin, 2019 ). We need to rely on these ecosystem services to build urban resilience, especially in the current global context of climate change.  3.4 International cooperation for development In the current global context of climate adaptation and the COVID-19 pandemic, building multi-stakeholder international partnerships to facilitate successful SDGs appears to be particularly essential (Zhao et al., 2020 ). The position of cities in global pandemic preparedness and climate governance systems is gaining increasing attention. Actors represented by cities are playing an increasingly important role in the global sustainable development arena. Habitat III considers urbanization a development tool and aligns it with the SDG 2030 agenda (Revi, 2016 ). International cooperation is capable of linking global and local perspectives, addressing specific barriers to urbanization in the achievement of SDGs, and mitigating and eliminating risk factors for urban adaptation (Oberlack and Eisenack, 2014 ). At the international level, multi-stakeholder cooperation is often seen as a way to bridge the high inequalities in historical responsibilities, impact risks, and adaptive capacity between developed and developing countries when dealing with global risks. In developing countries that lack infrastructure, the harsh effects of climate change are particularly apparent to residents. Therefore, developed countries are responsible for taking action to support and assist developing countries, which can inspire cooperation among more developing countries to achieve international agreements, such as the Paris Agreement (Robinson and Shine, 2018 ). International collaborative governance is a fundamental requirement for sustainable global urbanization development, and it requires countries to reconcile global concerns (such as carbon emissions) with local priorities (such as environmental issues and social needs for local economic development) to effectively coordinate and integrate the multiple interests of stakeholders involved in global urbanization development. Effective collective action is an important point for achieving sustainable urbanization and promoting the well-being of the “Anthropocene”. City networks have become important agents beyond national governments, and through the C40 Climate Leadership Group and WHO Healthy Cities, these networks are able to share best practices, tools, and resources and provide technical support for developing sustainable development plans and monitoring progress.  3.5 Four tips towards sustainable urbanization and SDGs Our work shows that urbanization can be a potential positive factor for achieving the majority of SDGs. Attention must be focused on sustainable urbanization to assist in achieving the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. To achieve the development goals for sustainable urbanization, a strong ‘science-policy-practice’ nexus is needed, which will promote a better understanding of the dynamics and drivers of urbanization and the interactions between different factors and sectors within cities. To facilitate the development of sustainable urbanization and the achievement of SDGs, we propose four tips.(a) Shared well-being and spatial justice for urban and rural residents. Urbanization should focus on achieving a more equitable concept of development that ensures the sharing of opportunities for economic growth among the entire population, especially the poor, to the greatest extent possible. For example, the planning and design of urban settlements and infrastructure are critical to residents’ well-being; however, investment in vulnerable informal settlements is generally limited. To reflect more ‘people-oriented’ identities, security, and incentives, urbanization should provide public infrastructure services to low-income and marginalized people in cities through multiple channels (Chen et al., 2019 ). Simultaneously, the relationship between urban and rural areas influences the long-term development of urbanization to a certain extent. If the focus is only on cities and does not include rural development, then the income gap between urban and rural areas will continue to widen and a crisis of rural hollowing will emerge due to the migration of the surplus labor force from rural areas to cities. Thus, urbanization should be closely integrated with rural revitalization strategies to promote the integrated development of urban and rural areas.  (b) Guiding green and low-carbon urban development. The exploration of green and low-carbon urbanization models should be strengthened globally. Promoting the development of green industries in cities, improving green technology standards, and optimizing the green spatial layout of cities are all important for the sustainable development of urbanization, and they have significant implications for providing a livable environment, clean air, clean water resources, safe and unpolluted arable land resources, and reasonable scales of carbon emissions. In addition, an increased awareness of energy conservation among residents needs to be encouraged and guided, such as reducing energy consumption and purchasing more energy-efficient household equipment. Strengthening the guidance of green and low-carbon consumption and promoting a frugal and environmentally friendly lifestyle are conducive to reducing the carbon footprint of lifestyles and building a low-carbon society.  (c) Building resilient cities. The urbanization process must fully account for the water and soil resource security and environmental support capacity (including ecological carrying capacity) and fundamentally change the limited attention focused on natural resources and the geographical environment. The scale, form, and distribution of urbanization at a regional scale should be reasonably determined according to the resource and environmental carrying capacities of different regions. It is worth noting that cities have obvious vulnerabilities and exposure to climate change risks, particularly in extreme climate regions. Therefore, urbanization must focus on climate change impacts to assist vulnerable cities in becoming more resilient to future climate risks. Urban resilience helps cities effectively resist external disturbances through targeted ecological restoration and enhancement strategies, which are of great importance for both sustainable urbanization and SDGs.  (d) Promoting multilateral cooperation in cities. Against the background of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, countries are facing tremendous shortfalls in terms of economic recovery, access to vaccines, and climate action; therefore, critical multilateral investments are urgently needed to open financial and policy space. Strengthening multilateralism and global partnerships is more important than ever. At present, low-income countries cannot afford the investments needed for densely populated cities and are constantly pushing for rapid industrialization, whereas high-income countries are resisting the transition due to economic interests and development inertia; thus, the critical moment when global urbanization adapts to climate transition may be missed. Many common problems have been circumvented during the urbanization process in China (Chen et al., 2016 ; Jiang et al., 2021 ), and these development experiences can provide inspiration and lessons for urbanization in developing countries, such as Africa. Multilateral cooperation in exploring global urbanization development, understanding the international situation, and assessing potential changes can provide important references for ensuring sustainable development in the future.      4 Conclusions This study presents a general framework and preliminary understanding for systematically analyzing the intrinsic role of urbanization in relation to SDGs. We recognize that urbanization has synergistic (positive) effects on the vast majority of SDGs and thus have specifically analyzed the pathways of action and mechanisms of influence in four fundamental fields where urbanization interacts with the SDGs. The results may help researchers and policymakers understand the potential contribution of urbanization to SDGs. A systematic approach was adopted to fully express the synergistic or trade-off interrelationships between urbanization and the 17 SDGs, and we investigated the strength of the intrinsic linkages between them. Our work presents a systematic and objective assessment of the direction and strength of the contribution of urbanization to SDGs through a combination of expert knowledge and peer-reviewed published literature. However, a quantitative assessment of the strength of the effect is still lacking and should be explored further. With climate change and the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, the problems of urbanization development have been gradually exposed; moreover, the central status of cities is increasing, thus contributing to the achievement of SDGs. We recommend the integration of four approaches, namely, urban and rural well-being and spatial justice, green and low-carbon cities, resilient cities, and multilateral cooperation, to promote the orderly development of sustainable urbanization. Midway through the implementation of SDGs, we call for urgent global action that incorporates the judgment of experts from different disciplines, governments, and social sectors to promote sustainable global urbanization to achieve the 2030 SDGs agenda.
