                  Our study illustrates how consumer social risk footprints can assist in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Combining the Social Hotspots Database (SHDB) and the Eora global multi-regional input-output table, we use input-output analysis to calculate a consumer social risk footprint (SF) of nations' imports. For our SFs, we select four indicators related to five of the UN's SDGs: gender equality (SDG 5 also 8.5 & 8.8); mother and child health (SDG 3, especially 3.1 & 3.2); governance (SDG 16, especially 16.5 & 16.6); and access to clean water (SDG 6, especially 6.1 & 6.2). After examining results for all four indicators we focus on gender equality to fully convey the value and limitations of using this method of analysis.
                  Our study compares producer (domestic) social risk and consumer social risk footprints resulting from international trade patterns. Generally, developed countries show higher social risk footprints while developing countries show higher domestic social risks with the exceptions of UK and Ireland in the developed-world, and China and India in the developing-world. Details of the SFs associated with exported products worldwide reveal that Pakistan, Yemen and Iran have some of the highest SF risk, while Australia, Canada and Denmark are among the lowest. These results are important for the UN in developing partnerships to address the Sustainable Development Goals and for organisations such as the World Bank, Trade Unions and NGOs' work towards a fairer world.

Our study illustrates how consumer social risk footprints can assist in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Combining the Social Hotspots Database (SHDB) and the Eora global multi-regional input-output table, we use input-output analysis to calculate a consumer social risk footprint (SF) of nations' imports. For our SFs, we select four indicators related to five of the UN's SDGs: gender equality (SDG 5 also 8.5 & 8.8); mother and child health (SDG 3, especially 3.1 & 3.2); governance (SDG 16, especially 16.5 & 16.6); and access to clean water (SDG 6, especially 6.1 & 6.2). After examining results for all four indicators we focus on gender equality to fully convey the value and limitations of using this method of analysis. Our study compares producer (domestic) social risk and consumer social risk footprints resulting from international trade patterns. Generally, developed countries show higher social risk footprints while developing countries show higher domestic social risks with the exceptions of UK and Ireland in the developed-world, and China and India in the developing-world. Details of the SFs associated with exported products worldwide reveal that Pakistan, Yemen and Iran have some of the highest SF risk, while Australia, Canada and Denmark are among the lowest. These results are important for the UN in developing partnerships to address the Sustainable Development Goals and for organisations such as the World Bank, Trade Unions and NGOs' work towards a fairer world.   Keywords social sustainability  input-output table  international trade  social footprint    1 Introduction In reporting the success of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) Ban Ki-Moon, while commending world leaders on some ‘remarkable gains’, acknowledged that inequalities persisted and success was not uniform. The MDG final report cited gender inequality as a significant gap in the program's success. Women are still more likely to be poor than men, less likely to participate in decision-making, and earn 24% less than men globally. In some countries the ratio of women to men in poor households has increased considerably. In particular, it cited: pregnancy and childbirth (Foreword, UN, 2015 ) and access to clean water as needing attention, with water scarcity affecting 40% of the global population. Realising ‘gender equality and empowerment of women’, says the report, must be integrated throughout the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (UN, 2015 , p. 31). Following global consultation, the UN launched the 2015 SDGs. The SDGs build on the legacy of the MDGs, but are: more globally collaborative; rooted in human rights standards; inclusive; offer an opportunity for civil society engagement; provide the business sector with a greater role; and aim to inspire the world.1  1 http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/sep/26/7-reasons-sdgs-will-be-better-than-the-mdgs    The MDGs were focused on countries and not aligned with global policy initiatives impacting on human rights (e.g. the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights). The SDGs provide a vision of humanity's progress that can inspire citizen actions as well as policymaking and business within and between countries. They connect with instruments such as the Paris agreement (United Nations Treaty Collection, 2015 ) and the UN Guiding Principles (United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner, 2011 ) and breathe new life into the UN Human Rights Declaration (United Nations, 2015 ). They have greater scope and accommodate more stakeholders, thus providing opportunities to discuss how trade relationships can impact the attainment of SDGs. Previous studies have demonstrated that developed economies' social footprints are often driven by imports while developing economies' own activities contribute significantly to their social footprints, sometimes in addition to their imports (Simas et al., 2014; Alsamawi et al., 2014 ). We consider a social footprint to be the measurement of the negative social impacts associated with the supply chain activities required to deliver a product, fulfil an organization's mission or a country's needs. Our study illustrates how social footprint calculations can be used to inform SDG related programs. We use a selection of indicators related closely to the SDGs (see section 1.3 in Appendix for details of the relevance of our indicators to SDGs) to illustrate the power of a combined Social Hotspots Database (SHDB) (Benoît-Norris and Norris, 2015 ), a resource that assigns risk levels by impact category, subcategory for each country and sector (Methods section, Appendix), and Eora database of the global economy. We then focus on gender equality to show the in-depth intelligence provided by this high-level combination of data sources. Our work benefits from increased data collection by governments worldwide and bodies like the UN, World Bank, NGOs, Trade Unions. Our work contributes to building ‘a world that counts’; where it is increasingly difficult to say ‘we didn't know’ (Melamed, 2014 , p. 3). It sheds light on important SDG indicators and illuminates their relationship to global supply chains. Using a multiregional input-output (MRIO) database (Databases, Appendix), we produce a quantitative, consistent and reliable measure of the social footprint (SF) of nations. Selection of indicators that make up our SF was influenced by the UN's final report on the MDGs (UN, 2015 ), that stated gender equality  and empowerment of women  must be central to the SDGs. Having singled out these two areas of concern as SF priorities we next examined the indicators supported by the SHDB. We identified four SHDB indicators that either directly addressed or contributed to our areas of concern: gender equality; mother/child wellbeing; governance; and access to clean water. These became the components of our social footprint and were subjected to the footprint calculus.  2 Results We first present results for the producer social risk (equation 7) and the consumer social risk footprint (equation 6) for a range of countries and group these into a broad typology. Gender equality then becomes our focus. In choosing this to illustrate the power of the combined SHDB/Eora database we demonstrate the usefulness of the footprint calculus in tracking the SDGs' progress. We use the gender equality indicator to show three more detailed findings: ranking of countries by net importers and net exporters of gender inequality risk; a map of global flows of gender inequality risk embodied in international trade; details of trading partners and commodities shown in the map. To help interpret our results we review how the footprint concept applies to the social risk metric. Equations 6 and 7 define two social risk measures. Social risk is essentially a quantification (via the weight vector w ) of the original qualitative SHDB risk rating, re-classified from GTAP to Eora sectors. It characterises social risks within a country and within an economic sector. By allocating social risk to countries, the SHDB follows a territorial perspective, equivalent to carbon emissions inventories submitted under the UNFCCC. By allocating risk to producing sectors, the SHDB follows a producer perspective. In contrast, the social risk footprint characterises entire supply chains, involving many sectors and many regions. Its supply-chain scope is equivalent to that of the carbon footprint of products and countries (Wiedmann, 2009 ). Owing to the Leontief calculus, the risk contained in these supply chains is attributed to economic actors who finally demand certain commodities in certain countries. Recall equation 3: Here, qx  represents the territorial or producer perspective, where q  contains territorially delineated data, and producers' total output x  determines the magnitude of risk. In contrast, my  represents the supply-chain or consumer perspective, where m  contains supply-chain risk of products, and consumers' final demand y  drives risk (Kanemoto et al., 2012 ). Producer and consumer perspectives entail entirely different policy responses to the same problem (Munksgaard and Pedersen, 2001; Peters and Hertwich, 2008a ). In analogy with the carbon emissions indicator, producer perspective information supports supply-side policies such as cleaner production incentives. A consumer perspective supports demand-side approaches such as selective procurement and awareness-raising of fair-trade campaigns (Peters and Hertwich, 2008b; Barrett et al., 2013 ). A consumer perspective and footprint calculus is also needed to analyse the issue of outsourcing of a domestic problem by substituting domestic production with imports from overseas (Peters, 2010; Hoekstra et al., 2016; Malik and Lan, 2016 ). These perspectives are complementary, and hence we will present both views in the following subsection. 2.1 The social risk footprints of nations Resulting from international trade patterns, a broad typology of social risk profiles with differences between producer social risk (dotted diamonds) and consumer social risk footprint (solid diamonds) is illustrated (Fig. 1  ). 2.1.1 Medium to high domestic risk, all indicators Countries in the bottom row of the 3 × 3 panel display medium to high domestic risk on all indicators. These include African nations (Ethiopia, Morocco, Algeria, Zambia), South America (Paraguay, Bolivia, Peru) and South Asian (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Papua New Guinea). In Africa for example this likely reflects a general high domestic social risk to women and negative attitudes towards gender equality, reported by the UN, as well as low access to clean water (UN Economic Commission for Africa, 2009 , p. 2); and particularly in Ethiopia, high mother and child mortality (UN Economic Commission for Africa, 2015 ). Our results for the three South America countries are explained, for example, by the fact that Paraguay is the lowest-ranked country in closing the gap (World Economic Forum, Global Gender Gap Report, 2015 ). While Peru is the worst performing country in women's health and Bolivia has a high maternal mortality rate (200 per 100,000 live births). The South Asia inclusions in this group of countries with medium to high domestic risk illustrates, for example Bangladesh and Cambodia's maternal mortality rates of 170 per 100,000 live births (World Economic Forum, 2015 ) and their overall low human development and gender equality rankings (Papua New Guinea 33rd out of 34 countries, Bangladesh 29th, Cambodia 27th (UN ESCAP, 2015 ). The reports cited above illuminate the situation depicted in Fig. 1 , showing the social footprint  is considerably lower in social risk than their domestic social risk. This is because the above nations source imports from countries with lower risk, which calls for supply-side measures, for example improving internal access to clean water through water purification. Additionally countries may be locked into risky export activities to meet debt-repayments or because transnational corporations, seeking ever-cheaper workforces, have no interest in improving conditions (Muradian and Martinez-Alier, 2001 ).  2.1.2 Equal domestic and footprint risk, all indicators Countries shown in the 3 × 3 panel's central row are on a par with their trade partners. These include Brazil, Argentina, and Chile, possibly reflecting in the case of Brazil, that 84% of the population was urbanised by 2010, fostering land policy and gender equity reforms (van Haeften, 2010 ). In Argentina we find government created jobs and a social safety net including minimum wage, unemployment benefits and fairer access to pensions and universal child allowance (Garriga et al., 2015 ). Between 2004 and 2012 these measures led to increased employment and a 15% fall in income inequality. In Chile's case over 70% of the population is urbanised and 70% of the working-age population hold upper-secondary educational certificate (Cord et al., 2015 ). These factors are credited with the falling birth rate, reduced maternal mortality rate (26 per 100,000 live births) and increased female workforce participation, which in turn have influenced government policies on sharing housework and child-rearing (UNICEF, 2011 ). The social progress above supports the clear difference seen between these countries and Paraguay, Bolivia and Peru with higher domestic social risk (Porter et al., 2015 ). As neighbours and trading partners it is unsurprising that domestic and footprint social risk for these countries are on a par. Brazil is Argentina's top export destination and top import origin (Hausmann et al., 2014 ). The top importers to Brazil and Chile are China and the USA, followed in the case of Brazil by Argentina and Germany and in the case of Chile by Brazil, then Argentina and Germany. In all cases the importing countries have similar or lower social risk accounting for social footprints on a par with domestic risk. The inclusion of the UK and Ireland in this group is interesting with domestic social risk higher than in other European countries in the top row of the panel. In UK this could be related to the policies of successive neo-conservative governments since Margaret Thatcher's election in 1979 and New Labour 2001-2010, which continued Britain's socio-economic transformation. Recently the Conservatives have presided over further cuts to social programs resulting in: less access to childcare than in EU-27 countries, low hours in part-time jobs and females earning on average 20% less than males (16% less in EU-27) (European Commission, 2013 ). In Ireland following the 2009 financial crisis women were disproportionately affected by job losses and expenditure cutbacks. Cuts to Child Benefit and One Parent Family Payment and funding to Women's NGOs, reversed hard-won equality infrastructure (Spillane, 2015 ). These cuts could be responsible for the higher social risk identified in Ireland and UK compared to other EU countries. As neighbours and trading partners it is unsurprising that their social risk footprints are similar to domestic social risk. Twenty-eight per cent of Ireland's imports are from the UK, followed by 15% from Russia. The UK imports predominantly come from Europe followed by China and USA. Although China is also represented in this central panel, detail reveals that its highest export to the UK is in the clothing sector, which is classed as China's main export of gender inequality. These higher social risk imports serve to balance the lower social risk imports from Germany and Netherlands. The presence of China, India and South Korea reflects China's and India's rapid development and the accompanying expectations for social renewal. For example, in China wages have increased following 10 years of industrial growth and easing of internal migration policies, which have seen rural labour absorbed into urban industries. A $586 billion stimulus package in 2008 was aimed at investing in urban public housing, rural housing renovation and infrastructure including water. Also targeted was increased spending on health, education and transport. In 2010 China's Minimum Livelihood Guarantee assisted 79 million rural and urban individuals. In India the government reports MDG achievements of its drinking-water target, gender equality in primary and secondary education, a halving of the population living below the poverty line and reduced infant mortality (Social Statistics Division, Government of India, 2015 ). South Korea has a steadily rising gross national income per capita ($34,620, 2011-2015), which is higher than China's ($13,170) and India's ($5630) over the same period (The World Bank, 2016 ). It has a well-educated workforce with 87% of adults completing secondary schooling (Kim et al., 2014 ) and female life expectancy of 85 years. This might have been expected to put South Korea into the top band of countries however female labour force participation is low at 41.6% (China 64%, India 27%), with women earning 64% of the average male earnings (Kim et al., 2014 ) and the mindset of traditional roles considered one of the main obstacles to greater gender equality (Hee-jung, 2015 ). The reasons for the similarities between these three countries' domestic social risk and social risk footprints are revealed through an examination of imports. Firstly, they import from each other, with China being India and Korea's main source of imports and Korea being China's. Also China, Korea and India source part of their imports from countries with lower social risk (e.g., Germany and Japan), these are balanced by other imports from countries with higher social risk (e.g., Nepal, Thailand), thus on average their domestic risk profiles resemble those of their import origins.  2.1.3 Medium to high footprint risk, all indicators Countries shown in the top row of the panel are characterised by below-average domestic social risk, but elevated risk embodied in international supply chains. The countries include Scandinavia (Sweden and Norway), northern Europe (Germany, Netherlands, Belgium) and Japan. With an Equality Ombudsman and a Minister for Gender Equality, Sweden ensures that its equality policies are enacted. Norway, with its 1978 Gender Equality Act and the Anti-Discrimination Ombud Act to monitor progress, is also seen as a model of gender equality. Hence both countries have very low domestic social risk. Although both countries import mainly from surrounding European countries both also import from China, which, especially in Norway's case is the main gender inequality risk. A deeper analysis shows that the clothing and leather industries are the main components of this risk. Netherlands, Germany and Belgium fare slightly less well on the gender equity and mother/child indicators. In Netherland's case this could be linked to discrimination faced by immigrants, refugees and minorities identified in reporting to the UN's Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. In Germany the gender pay gap significantly exceeds that of all other EU-27 countries. For Belgium the reason may relate to the status of the two instruments supporting gender equity: Commission on the Status of Women and the Institute for Equal Opportunity between Women and Men. These may lack the clout of Sweden and Norway's Acts of Parliament. The UN's WomenWatch, 2010 reported that one of Belgium's problems was lack of government commitment to gender equality issues (Smet, 2010 ). Like Sweden and Norway, the social risk footprint  is elevated because these countries' supply chains embody higher social risk. For example, Germany is one of the top ranking gender inequality importers with the main contributors being clothing and leather products from China. Netherlands and Belgium are similar. Interestingly, Japan reveals two outliers, performing relatively well on governance, but poorly on gender equality. This is because of Japan's community-minded and law-abiding culture, but relatively sexist mind-set. Although addressed in legislation the traditional view of gendered roles prevails (Gender Equality Bureau Cabinet Office, 2013 ). The home/abroad gap in social risk calls for demand-side approaches, such as Japan's growing demand for ethical products (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, 2013 ). In the European Union, Fair Trade  has been included in the main funding instrument for development aid, the Development Cooperation Instrument, 2014-2020.  2.1.4 High domestic social risk, one indicator Some countries exhibit unusual domestic social risk on one indicator (Fig. 2  ). Serbia, Moldova and Czech Republic show a spike in the governance  indicator. Serbia is in the process of transitioning from authoritarian rule to democracy helped by: UNDP, on parliamentary reform, transparency and social inclusion; Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, aligning legislation with international anti-corruption standards; and USAID, helping build civil organisations and women's leadership. Moldova became independent of the Soviet Union in 1991 creating political instability, economic chaos and corruption (USAID, 2012 ). With its banking system embezzling a billion dollars out of an economy of eight billion, Moldova is probably the poorest country in Europe. A 2014 report on the Czech Republic cites politicians' corruption as a major issue (Guasti et al., 2014 ) along with a lack of investment in education resulting in a poorly-skilled workforce. Political opposition to equal opportunities for all, including migrants, has meant welfare cuts. Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia show a spike in the indicator gender equality,  perhaps explained in the case of Kuwait by the fact that although in 2005 Kuwait awarded women the right to vote and hold public office by 2014 there were only three women in parliament. Another factor is related to the high migrant population. In 2013, 45% of the female population was migrant. Migrant women, especially from SE Asia suffer a high rate of rape and woman's testimony is worth half that of a man so rape is often unpunished. Sentences are capped at three years for violence against women and domestic violence is rarely reported. Women are particularly vulnerable because the minimum age for marriage for girls is 15. Polygamy is permitted and frequently wives waive the right to housing and financial maintenance (Selkaly et al., 2014 ). There is a 50% divorce rate. However, divorce by a man takes effect immediately, a woman may seek divorce for a small number of specified reasons. Adding to their insecurity, while two thirds of university graduates are women, women need higher grades to enter some programs. And while there are no legal impediments to female workforce participation, social mores ascribe women's roles to home-making. In Qatar women gained the right to vote and hold public office in 2003. However, by 2014 there were still no women in parliament to influence debate, neither were there any independent civil society organisations concerned with women's issues (Selkaly et al., 2014 ). In 2013 only 23% of the population was female and 65% of those were migrants. Rape within marriage is not considered a crime and rape outside of marriage, especially of migrant workers, is unprotected by the law. It can even result in a jail term for the victim if she becomes pregnant. Polygamy is permitted (Selkaly et al., 2014 ) and there is a 50% divorce rate (as above). Women under 25 years need a guardian's permission to travel or obtain a driver's license. While discrimination in employment is prohibited married women must have their husband's permission to work. They receive 16-45% less pay than men and are often sacked on becoming pregnant. Saudi Arabia is a hereditary monarchy. In 2003 the Council of Ministers introduced the election of a third of the appointed Consultative Council members with male suffrage only. In 2016 20% of the appointed members of the Council were women. While women make up 45% of the population, 21% of these women are migrants. A guardian's consent is needed for marriage and like Kuwait and Qatar, polygamy is permitted. Laws around divorce are also similar to those of Kuwait and Qatar. Domestic violence is thought to be widespread. A divorced women must return to her family where male guardianship continues to circumscribes all women's rights, including movement outside the house, education and jobs, authorization of identification cards and passports and permission to travel. Women are not permitted to drive or, in many cases use taxis, which severely restricts education and employment (only 19.1% of women 15-64 years were in the workforce in 2012). Another restriction on education is that many fields of study are restricted to males. An overarching burden for women is that there is no written penal code and most punishments derive from Sharia. In the case of ‘blood payment’ a woman's life is worth half that of a man. Rape victims outside marriage are punished and marital rape is not considered a crime. Abortion is forbidden and medical treatment of women is inhibited by sex segregation (Selkaly et al., 2014 ).  2.1.5 Low domestic social risk, one indicator Looking at low domestic social risk outliers Egypt, Georgia, Iran, Kazakhstan and Malaysia share the benefit of low social risk on the indicator clean water,  which seems to be linked to natural factors, ancient traditions and cross-border water-sharing agreements.  For example, Ancient Egypt had a well-developed system of waterwheels, dams and canals taking clean water to most of the populace. In modern times the Aswan High Dam was constructed in the 1900s. More recently there has been an increase in piped water, achieving 100% urban coverage and 99% rural (World Bank, 2016 ). This has been helped along by a loan system supported by the Government, UNICEF and others helping ensure access to clean water in rural areas. Water production is state owned however access might change as private companies participate in controlling water, already increasing the price to households. Georgia and Kazakhstan have an abundance of rivers and freshwater lakes. Georgia has 100km3  of fresh water resources and Kazakhstan has around 95km3 , (Global Water Partnership of Central Asia and the Caucasus, 2006 ). These are property of the state with rural communities enjoying traditional access to wells and springs. In 1991, following independence from the Soviet Union, state and collective farms continued to predominate with traditional sharing of water resources. Since 2000 USAID and the EU have contributed to Georgia's water management and protection projects to reduce pollution (UN Economic Commission for Europe, 2007 ). While in 2001, Kazakhstan became party to the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes  signing agreements on cross-border rivers and water facilities with China and the Russian Federation. In 2002 the Central Asian and Caucasus Regional Water Partnership was formed to address issues threatening water security in the region with funding from World Bank, UNDP, Japan and Europe. Iran's system of dams and weirs was built over 1000 years ago and is still in use. Water bodies are managed through ancient traditions of water rights supported by legislation giving the government responsibility for provision of water to the population. In 2000, 94% of population had access to clean drinking water (Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, 2008 ). In 2006, 94 large storage dams were operating, with 85 more under construction. Malaysia has an abundance of water resources. In 1983 it published a set of National Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality (revised 1989 & 2000). Drinking water is supplied to over 95% of the population. In 2000, the Malaysian government formulated its vision to: conserve and manage its water resources to ensure adequate and safe water for all (including the environment)  (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2000 ). In keeping with this resolve in 2007, research found no microbial contamination in 100 random samples and most other quality parameters were within acceptable limits (Ong et al., 2007 ). However a 2009 study indicated that Government water department workers needed to be better educated and that corruption at all levels of governance was an issue (Chan, 2009 ). As in the cases above Malaysia has enjoyed abundant and clean water however in all cases there are issues that will need to be dealt with in the future such as population growth, urbanization and increasing pollution. Madagascar enjoys high gender equity. One of the reasons could be that Madagascar has enshrined male/female equality in its constitution “protected by law without any discrimination based on sex, education, wealth, origin, religious belief or opinion.” In 1989 it became party to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). In 2004 it signed the Protocol to the African Charter on Human Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa. Notwithstanding many women and girls, especially in rural areas are still bound by customs relating to early marriage, property ownership and ability to earn a living. In response the government is accepting more women into the military and police force and working with NGOs and the African Union to establish vocational centres and action against violence. Women's participation is increasing in decision-making bodies and at all levels of government (The World Policy Institute, 2016 ).   2.2 Gender inequality risk and international trade In the previous subsection we have presented our results as risks, essentially ratios of risk-weighted and unweighted domestic employment and employment footprints, respectively. It is also interesting to examine the absolute magnitude of social risk caused by international trade, since this is determined by risk level, and by the size of international shipments. This can be conveniently depicted as a world flow map of social risk embodiments, in units of risk-weighted employment (Fig. 4 ). In this subsection we restrict our exposition to gender equality. In this picture, the US-to-Canada trade link conveys a sizeable social risk, because the trade flow between these two neighbours is large. The same holds for the Japan-US and Germany-US links. These however form exceptions and the major part of the flow pattern is dominated by social risk affecting people in China, Thailand, India, Mexico, Bangladesh and Indonesia, involved in producing export commodities, ultimately for the benefit of consumers in the US, Germany or the UK. In the preceding section we used the notion of embodiment  to refer to consumers' implication in social issues arising in developing countries that produce their consumer items. We dissected overall social footprints by indicator, country, and bilateral trade relationships. Here we offer the most detailed level of information: the commodity nature of the trade flow embodiment for the most important importers (Table 1  ) and exporters (Table 2  ). The countries examined are largely identical with the top- and bottom-ranking countries in Fig. 3  . Australia is a top importer. Its citizens are implicated in overseas gender issues through importation of, for example, Chinese-made IT and coffee from Papua New Guinea. Recent studies have pointed to China's increasing gender gap in employment and wages. Where women are employed in manufacturing of computer and electronic equipment they tend to be cut out of higher skilled, better-paid jobs even when education levels are the same (Dasgupta et al., 2015 ). Foxconn is one of China's major manufacturers of electronics. In 2009 several suicides occurred at its factories, through poor working conditions, 60-h workweeks and low pay. About 90% of PNG's coffee growers are smallholders, 2.5 million people depend on them. The World Bank is helping growers to form partnerships to assist in replanting and branding (The World Bank, 2014 ). However, according to a study by Care International 's Coffee Industry Support Programme in 2015, gender inequality is the reason that the industry doesn't prosper. They cite gendered roles in growing and production, low pay for female workers and gender-based violence as the main impediments (Care International, 2015 ). We also find tourism in the list of imports. Australian tourists spending money in Vietnam, Thailand, PNG and Indonesia count as imports of commodities from these countries. Our results mean that there are gender issues to be found in these countries' tourism industries where insecure employment, low pay and long hours characterise hotel work (Baum, 2013 ). Receptionists, in Indonesia for example, earn considerably less than receptionists in other occupations. In hotels and restaurants there is added risk of sexual harassment and violence from customers. Women are also at risk from constant contact with water and cleaning products. Turning to Canada: The gender significance of its imports of vehicles and equipment from the US is a reflection of the size of this trade flow, not of its gender risk intensity. However, the remaining imports, for example Chinese, Indian and Thai clothing, illustrate high gender risk. Informalisation of the workforce impacts women more than men, with informal workers rarely covered by wage legislation. Indian clothing industry workers have the lowest wages in the industry worldwide and no limitation on working hours. Looking further up the supply chain in India, the Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations in the Netherlands (2014)  reports that young girls are exploited in the cotton-seed industry, enduring long hours, low wages and exposure to pesticides. In some textile mills young girls from rural areas are often recruited with promise of a dowry. Meanwhile they endure low pay, are overworked and locked in factory-owned hostels (Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (SOMO), 2014 ). Some of the trade links are between European countries, such as Germany, Netherlands, UK, and Scandinavian countries. Once again, these flows are more about the integration of the intra-European commodity market than an indication of gender-related risk; excepting Germany's imports of leather products from China and India, which do indicate high gender-related risk. According to an ILO report women make up between 50 and 90% of the leather industry workforce, with conditions said to be ‘particularly challenging for female workers’ (International Labour Organization, 2014 , p. 12) who endure toxic environments in tanneries and factories for less than the minimum wage. Russia's traditional trade links with former Soviet republics such as Ukraine, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan are apparent in gender risk embodiments in Ukrainian food products, and Tajik and Uzbek cotton. Women make up around 43% of agriculture workers. They have no access to credit and face unfair competition from male workers able to mechanise their agricultural production. In addition, the creation of private farms, from previous collectives, has forced many women into becoming unpaid family workers (Kisselyova, 2007 ). In Tajikistan 27% more women than men work in agriculture. Even though many women have previously operated machinery or held managerial positions on collective farms, they must rely on seasonal unskilled and poorly paid jobs (Asia Development Bank (ADB), 2006 ). Women's work in Uzbekistan underwent a similar process as agriculture moved from collectives to Farmers' Associations managed predominantly by men. Even though much of the labour is undertaken by women they are regarded as casual, unskilled and often unpaid family workers (Kandiyoti, 2002 ). Looking at Japan's imports one of the major contributors to Japan's gender risk footprint is Vietnamese seafood. In Vietnam 80% of aquaculture workers are women. However, their roles are confined mainly to fish processing, which is low skilled, low paid and has detrimental health effects, particularly through repetitive muscular strain (Hao, 2012 ). Examining the exporters list reveals insights about situations on the opposite side of supply-chains. Gender inequality risk in Pakistan, Syria, China and Morocco is strongly tied to those countries' dependence on textile industry exports. For example, in Pakistan 10 million farm families rely on the textile industry for their livelihood and textiles and garments constitute > 50% of the country's exports. Women textile workers face harassment, lack toilet facilities, are forced to work night shifts and overtime, are paid less than the minimum wage and have no union representation (Spevacek et al., 2013 ). They are forced predominantly to live in low-income areas around factories, working piece rate or are employed on unwritten contracts, which are typically with small businesses linked to global supply chains. Rice exports feature high against India's gender issues. For example, in 2013-14 India exported 3.76 million tons of basmati making it the global market leader (International Rice Research Institute, 2015 ). Women provide up to 80% of rice-growing labour mainly as low wage landless labourers. This is often because they lack access to credit and financial services leaving them with no means of owning land or equipment (M S Swaminathan Research Foundation, 2005 ). Saudi Arabia's crude oil and tourist industries are significant sources of exported gender inequality. For example, nearly 82% of women do not go out to work, thus maintaining male domination and control (Center for Democracy and Human Rights in Saudi Arabia, 2016 ). Nearly 90% of exports are related to oil. However few women are employed in the oil industry, because male/female roles are strictly controlled (Norris, 2011 ) and women are by law segregated and forbidden to direct men or manage finances. Even with an engineering degree women are confined to office work. The same applies to roles in government employment. The tourism industry employs around 750,000 people, who in 2013, served the needs of around 16.7 million tourists, mostly pilgrims (58%) or business travellers (23%). Yet despite recent Saudiisation providing jobs for well-educated, unemployed Saudis, only 27% of those employed in tourism were Saudis (Sahoo, 2014 ). Because of the above difficulties international hotel chains import their own skilled labour, even though non-nationals are granted only basic employment and residential rights and female foreign workers are particularly vulnerable (see 2.1 above) (Aldosari, 2013 ).   3 Discussion Ranking countries in terms of their footprint-to-domestic social risk ratio reveals an overview of countries with the largest gaps between their domestic and footprint risk profiles (diamonds in Fig. 1 ). Fig. 2  yields a clear distinction between net exporters of social risk, mostly developing, and often conflict-stricken countries such as Pakistan, Yemen, Iran, Syria, Chad and Algeria, and net importers of social risk, mostly developed and socially advanced countries like Denmark, Norway, Germany and Netherlands. This social risk arrangement between wealthy and poor nations has been discussed by political economists since Adam Smith wrote in 1776 that:“The proprietor of stock is properly a citizen of the world, … apt to abandon the country in which he was exposed to a vexatious inquisition, … remove his stock to some other country where he could either carry on his business, or enjoy his fortune more at his ease.” (Smith, [1776] 1904 ).2  2 http://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN.html  (accessed 20/04/16)     Such supply chain manoeuvres are known as a race to the bottom: a constant search for the cheapest inputs in order to remain competitive in a global market. Our results indicate that some of the poorest countries are exporters of social risk to some of the wealthiest. Some may be trapped in these arrangements. For example, with textiles and garments constituting > 50% of Pakistan's exports, and India's rice exports worth around US$7.9 billion in 2014 it's possible that these high social risk activities keeping the cost of exports low, are viewed as essential to those countries' economic survival. Other countries such as Saudi Arabia, export a different social risk. In Saudi's case the social risks embodied in oil products, which constitute 90% of exports, are not linked to dangerous work practices inflicted on Saudi's nationals working in the oil industry, but are inflicted on imported labour. Around 76% of workers in Saudi are foreign. While workplace accidents are falling there are still around 56,000 accidents a year many of which will therefore affect foreign workers rather than Saudi nationals (UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office, 2016 ). This is not a developing country taken advantage of by developed countries that demand its exports, but of one of the G-20 developing economies exploiting a largely foreign workforce to realise its wealth. The large disparity of social risks between exporting and importing countries requires appropriate trade policies, however even though environmentally risky exports like raw materials from extractive industries are recognised, addressing such issues from within the exporting country is not easy. The power differential between those who profit from the industry and those who work in it is huge (Muradian and Martinez-Alier, 2001 ). Some domestic social risk cases have required action at the consumer/importer side, for example Section 1502 of the US Dodd-Frank Act for reporting use of conflict minerals, to effect changes in working conditions. Future supply-side measures may be made possible by debt-relief programs and debt management (Battaile et al., 2015 ) which will address investment in infrastructure and human capital (International Development Association and International Monetary Fund, 2011 ) to aid capacity for environmental and socioeconomic policy development. Focusing on gender inequality (Figs. 3 & 4  ; Tables 1 & 2 ) we can see in detail the top importing countries (Australia, Canada, Denmark) and the top exporters (Pakistan, Yemen, Iran). We can also see the major implicated goods and services, with clothing, tourism and leather frequently topping the list. Major tragedies like the Rana Plaza garment factory fire have brought clothing industry issues to public attention. Pictures flashed around the world as reporters uncovered evidence implicating international brands. Three years later two multi-stakeholder groups, The Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety and Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, have prompted building inspections and the creation of 392 labour inspector positions. Global brands have raised wages, inspected buildings and made transparent their supply chains (Stangler, 2015 ). Notwithstanding, huge problems remain in the industry across Vietnam, China, India and Bangladesh (see media reports of fatal traffic accidents involving garment factory workers (Samean, 2016 )). However other producer/consumer relationships such as leather products from India and China into Finland, Norway, Denmark and Germany embody equally high social risk (see Pulitzer Centre on Crisis Reporting for horrendous conditions of India's leather workers (Gallagher, 2014 )). Similarly uncovered by our research is the export of tourism from Saudi Arabia into Japan, India, Korea and Indonesia. This is another area that embodies gender inequality without attracting media attention. This may change when Saudi begins to issue visas to tourists other than pilgrims, business and conference travelers. The treatment of foreign female workers in the tourist industry may then come under closer scrutiny as well as the exclusion of Saudi women from many occupations. Our work highlights another issue. Tables 1 and 2  and the world map show significant flows wherever either the trade flow is high or the gender risk is high. In the first case the gender risk can be minor but magnified by the volume of trade. In the second case the volume of trade can be low but magnified by the seriousness of the risk. Both indicate gender inequality however it is likely that opinions may differ over where time, funding and energy should be focused. Our view is that fundamental rights should be defended wherever they are breached, and whether the abuse of rights is happening to one or many. There need be no either/or if we all take responsibility to combat the abuse of rights wherever it occurs.  4 Conclusions Realising ‘gender equality and empowerment of women’, says the UN's final report on the MDGs (UN, 2015 , p. 31), must be at the heart of the SDGs. High quality data is recognised by the UN as crucial to achieving success because, as the International Women's Development Agency (IWDA) states “it's harder to ignore rights violations in the face of powerful evidence.” (https://www.iwda.org.au/what-we-do/  accessed 31/01/16) Our work supports such groups as the IWDA and the Association of Women's Rights in Development (AWID: http://www.awid.org/about-us  accessed 31/01/16) in their bid to track implementation of the UN's post-2015 agenda with its emphasis on powerful evidence and gender equality. Above we have illustrated how a selection of SHDB indicators can be combined with the Eora economic database to shed light on social risk in global supply chains. Our four selected social footprint indicators are closely aligned with five of the Sustainable Development Goals: Good health and wellbeing; Gender equality; Clean water and sanitation; Decent work and economic growth; Promote just, peaceful and inclusive societies. The UN's final report on the MDGs recognised the crucial importance of good data, saying that sustainable development demanded.…a data revolution to improve the availability, quality, timeliness and disaggregation of data to support the implementation of the new development agenda... (UN, 2015 , p. 10).    Our work illustrates that good data exist. The technological infrastructure also exists to allow big data sets to be combined where previously this was not possible. We believe that by combining the SHDB and Eora and using this to examine social risks in global supply chains we have developed a tool useful to:• businesses for fulfilling their social corporate responsibility;  • governments of developing countries for developing policy around supply-side social issues;  • governments of developed nations in understanding and addressing the consequences of their imports on struggling economies;  • NGOs needing sound data for campaigns that highlight supply chain issues; and  • multi-national and global institutions as they provide advice, guidelines and support to assist all nations in meeting their goals.    Compared to most existing assessments of social risk, which are limited to the local social phenomena and corresponding solutions, our results show the social impacts of globalization. Our results show the teleconnections of social risks between distant groups of consumers and workers, and indicate that consumers should take some responsibility to tackle social risks where the production occurs. Therefore, these results can be useful to the World Bank, Trade Unions and NGOs to help build stronger partnerships between trading countries. For example, international organisations can host activities or develop policies to encourage consuming countries to share advanced technologies, management experience and enforcement strategies with producing countries that lack them. The same principle can apply to global companies that can use our results to build bridges between their branches, sharing technologies and experience to reach their integral sustainability goals. Probably of equal importance, the work we present here represents a way of tracking improvements so that stakeholders everywhere can be confident that the SDGs are being met. Our work lays the ground for future work focusing on gender inequality issues such as the gender pay gap and gendered employment. It provides a bottom-up analysis within international supply-chains that can extend gender inequality research beyond our paper.
