                  Soil inorganic carbon (SIC) is currently not included in the list of key soil properties related to ecosystem services (e.g., provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services). Soil inorganic carbon is a dynamic key soil property used in soil classification, taxonomy and fertility, therefore its inclusion in the framework of ecosystem services is important. With soils rapidly changing due to human use and climate change, the ecosystem services framework should include not only soil organic carbon (SOC), but SIC as well since it is of global importance to soil fertility and the long-term carbon (C) cycle, especially in semiarid and arid climates where SIC comprises the largest C pool. The objective of this study is to assess the value of SIC in the 12 soil orders of Soil Taxonomy at the country scale (continental United States (U.S.)) and at the farm scale (the Cornell University Research Farm) within the context of ecosystem services, specifically provisioning and supporting services. At the country scale, the total estimated midpoint value of SIC storage within the upper two meters of soil is $5.17 T (i.e., 5.17 trillion U.S. dollars). The soil orders having the highest total value of SIC storage (based on an average 2014 price of $10.42 per U.S. ton of CaCO3 lime in the U.S.) are: 1) Mollisols ($2.22 T), 2) Aridisols ($1.23 T), 3) Alfisols ($523B, i.e., 523 billion U.S. dollars), and 4) Entisols ($489B). In terms of SIC content (i.e., value per square meter), the soil orders are ranked: 1) Vertisols ($2.22 m−2), 2) Aridisols ($1.52 m−2), 3) Mollisols ($1.10 m−2), and 4) Inceptisols ($0.49 m−2). At the farm scale, based on variable measured and reported soil sample depths, the soil orders having the highest total value of SIC (based on an average 2014 price of $10.88 price per U.S. ton of CaCO3 for the State of New York (NY)) were: 1) Alfisols, 2) Inceptisols, and 3) Entisols. However, the farm-scale estimates varied greatly depending on whether the values were based on field-derived vs. SSURGO-derived data. The results of this study begin to provide an estimated value of the importance of SIC when assessing ecosystem services. The potential impacts on society from this research include adding SIC into the ecosystem services framework for the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals. Future research should identify and quantify other important ecosystem services that SIC may provide on a variety of spatial and temporal scales, as well as the potential need of including total C (TC) and interactions between SIC and SOC pools.

Department of Forestry and Environmental Conservation Clemson University 261 Lehotsky Hall Clemson SC 29634 USA       Soil inorganic carbon (SIC) is currently not included in the list of key soil properties related to ecosystem services (e.g., provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services). Soil inorganic carbon is a dynamic key soil property used in soil classification, taxonomy and fertility, therefore its inclusion in the framework of ecosystem services is important. With soils rapidly changing due to human use and climate change, the ecosystem services framework should include not only soil organic carbon (SOC), but SIC as well since it is of global importance to soil fertility and the long-term carbon (C) cycle, especially in semiarid and arid climates where SIC comprises the largest C pool. The objective of this study is to assess the value of SIC in the 12 soil orders of Soil Taxonomy at the country scale (continental United States (U.S.)) and at the farm scale (the Cornell University Research Farm) within the context of ecosystem services, specifically provisioning and supporting services. At the country scale, the total estimated midpoint value of SIC storage within the upper two meters of soil is $5.17 T (i.e., 5.17 trillion U.S. dollars). The soil orders having the highest total value of SIC storage (based on an average 2014 price of $10.42 per U.S. ton of CaCO3  lime in the U.S.) are: 1) Mollisols ($2.22 T), 2) Aridisols ($1.23 T), 3) Alfisols ($523B, i.e., 523 billion U.S. dollars), and 4) Entisols ($489B). In terms of SIC content (i.e., value per square meter), the soil orders are ranked: 1) Vertisols ($2.22 m−2 ), 2) Aridisols ($1.52 m−2 ), 3) Mollisols ($1.10 m−2 ), and 4) Inceptisols ($0.49 m−2 ). At the farm scale, based on variable measured and reported soil sample depths, the soil orders having the highest total value of SIC (based on an average 2014 price of $10.88 price per U.S. ton of CaCO3  for the State of New York (NY)) were: 1) Alfisols, 2) Inceptisols, and 3) Entisols. However, the farm-scale estimates varied greatly depending on whether the values were based on field-derived vs. SSURGO-derived data. The results of this study begin to provide an estimated value of the importance of SIC when assessing ecosystem services. The potential impacts on society from this research include adding SIC into the ecosystem services framework for the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals. Future research should identify and quantify other important ecosystem services that SIC may provide on a variety of spatial and temporal scales, as well as the potential need of including total C (TC) and interactions between SIC and SOC pools.   Keywords Agriculture  Calcium  Food security  Land use  Liming  Pedogenic carbonates (PC)  Soil inorganic carbon (SIC)    1 Introduction Soil inorganic carbon (SIC) is a part of total carbon (TC) in soils, however, it is currently not included with the key soil properties related to ecosystem services (e.g., provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services) (Fig. 1  ). Soil inorganic carbon is an integral part of terrestrial carbon, which can either be a source or sink of carbon (C). The United Nations (UN) adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals as guidelines to enhance the sustainability of global human societies (Keestra et al., 2016 ). Soil functions are critical to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals because soils provide clean water, clean air, and food for global societies (Keestra et al., 2016 ). The UN Sustainable Development Goals that relate to soil functions include: “2. End hunger, achieve food security, and improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture, 3. Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages, 6. Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, 13. Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts, 15. Protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and biodiversity loss” (Keestra et al., 2016 ). Ecosystem services exemplify how the ecosystem benefits society through commodities and services (Costanza et al., 2014 ). Ecosystem services are broken down into four main categories: 1. provisioning services (food, fuel and fiber, raw materials, gene pool, fresh water/water retention), 2. regulating services (climate and gas regulation, water regulation, erosion and flood control, pollination/seed dispersal, pest and disease regulation, carbon sequestration, water purification), 3. cultural services (recreation/ecotourism, esthetic/sense of place, cultural heritage), and 4. supporting services (weathering/soil formation, nutrient cycling, provisioning of habitat) (Adhikari and Hartemink, 2016 ). The ecosystem services that relate to soil properties of organic carbon include provisioning services: food, fuel, and fiber, raw materials, and fresh water/water retention; regulating services: climate and gas regulation, water regulation, erosion and flood control, pest and disease regulation, carbon sequestration, and water purification; cultural services: recreation/ecotourism, esthetic/sense of place, and knowledge/education/inspiration; supporting services: weathering/soil formation, nutrient cycling, and provisioning of habitat (Adhikari and Hartemink, 2016 ). Total carbon (TC) represents the summation of soil inorganic carbon (SIC) and soil organic carbon (SOC) in a terrestrial soil environment. Presently, SOC is included into the ecosystem services framework; however, SIC is not included, despite SIC's contribution within the ecosystem services framework (Keestra et al., 2016 ). The exclusion of SIC from the ecosystem services framework stems from the initial supremacy placed on SOC as the driver for soil fertility and its existence as a super colloid. Soil inorganic carbon is a major component of the global carbon cycle and is found in various forms such as, gaseous CO2(g) , dissolved CO2(aq) , carbonic acid H2 CO3(aq) , bicarbonate HCO3 − (aq) , carbonate CO3 2− (aq) , and solid-phase carbonate (primarily CaCO3 ) (Monger, 2014 ; Zamanian et al., 2016 ) Soil inorganic carbon forms, bicarbonate and carbonate, together comprise a larger terrestrial carbon pool than SOC (Monger et al., 2015 ). Furthermore, solid-phase calcium carbonate is divided two types: lithogenic carbonate and pedogenic carbonate (Monger et al., 2015 ). Lithogenic carbonates are formed in a marine environment and can be found as fragments in a terrestrial setting (Monger et al., 2015 ). Pedogenic carbonates are formed authigenically in a soil environment that is commonly under alkaline, arid conditions (Monger et al., 2015 ). Soil inorganic carbon provides a significant contribution to ecosystem services, but it is currently overlooked. The objective of this study is to assess the value of SIC in the 12 soil orders of Soil Taxonomy at the country scale (the continental United States) and at farm scale (the Cornell University Research Farm) within the context of ecosystem services, specifically provisioning and supporting services.  2 Soil inorganic carbon and USDA Soil Taxonomy Soil inorganic carbon has a variable distribution in the U.S. by soil order and depth. Using the State Soil Geographic Database (STATSGO), Guo et al. (2006)  reported that half of the 12 soil orders in the conterminous U.S. have appreciable accumulations of SIC and ranked the soil orders by midpoint SIC storage in the following order: (1) Mollisols, (2) Aridisols, (3) Alfisols, (4) Entisols, (5) Inceptisols, and (6) Vertisols. Soils with “slight” and “intermediate” degrees of weathering tend to have more carbonates, whereas soils with a “strong” degree of weathering tend to have little to no accumulations of SIC. Mollisols, Alfisols and Vertisols are important soil orders globally due to high soil productivity for world crops (Liu et al., 2012 ). Soil inorganic carbon accumulations are identified at the suborder level (e.g. Calcids, Durids, Gypsids, etc.), and by lowercase letter symbols to designate subordinate distinctions within master horizons (e.g., k = accumulation of carbonates, c = concretions or nodules, etc.) (Soil Survey Staff, 2014 ). Uncertainty associated with STATSGO reported values for SIC is unknown, however Zhong and Xu (2011)  reported that there were significant differences in soil organic matter (SOM) values when comparing STATGO to the more detailed SSURGO databases. Zhong and Xu (2011)  concluded that the SSURGO values for SOM more closely matched field data and were more likely more accurate. This indicates that relying on STATGO for SIC estimates (Guo et al., 2006 ) can introduce an unknown quantity of error. The spatial and vertical distribution of SIC is influenced by the amount of rainfall, which tends to decrease from east to west in the U.S. with more carbonate-rich soils found in the western part of the country. Because agricultural activity is influenced by soil pH and naturally available SIC (liming material), early agricultural exploration was driven somewhat from the east coast to the west by the search of naturally neutral and fertile soils (Richter and Markewitz, 2001 ). Additionally, Goddard et al. (2009)  reported significant potential formation of SIC as a result of atmospheric wet calcium deposition (including from aeolian sources) with as much as 2.6 × 108  kg C as SIC was estimated to be formed over a 9 year period barring losses from deep leaching and erosion.  3 Soil inorganic carbon and ecosystem services 3.1 Provisioning services Provisioning services refer to the products, which can be obtained from the ecosystem such as raw materials, food, fuel, and fiber (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005 ). Soil inorganic carbon is a natural “raw” liming material (found in both disseminated and concentrated forms; e.g., concretions) and is important in food, fuel, and fiber production (Tables 1 and 2   ) due to its influence on the soil pH (regulation of nutrient availability) (West and McBride, 2005 ; Mikhailova et al., 2006 ). Soil inorganic carbon is also beneficial to human health since “adequate calcium intake is critical for good health and may reduce risks for certain chronic disease” (Wang and Li, 2008 ). Calcium intake inadequacy is a worldwide problem and many countries, such as India and China, have been increasing dairy production (Wang and Li, 2008 ). Calcium intake varies by country, for example, average daily calcium intake is 962 mg for U.S. men, and 756 mg for U.S. women in 1999–2004 (Wang and Li, 2008 ). If every person had access to the recommended 1 g/day of calcium (the total daily requirement for the world), with a population of 7.5 billion people (2017), the total results in 7500 metric tons/day. Insufficient calcium intake is a global problem (Wang and Li, 2008 ), and it is important to assess, monitor and value SIC for sustainable development. Increased demand for food production and biofuels increased nutrient and alkalinity removal as documented by studies in the U.S. Midwest (Avila-Segura et al., 2011 ), and export of alkalinity via rivers (Raymond, 2003 ). Soil inorganic carbon is found in various forms, quantities and depths in different soils. For example, disseminated carbonates and pedogenic carbonate concretions were reported in the Chernozem, common soils in the bread-basket regions of Russia and Ukraine (Mikhailova et al., 2006 ; Mikhailova and Post, 2006 ). Soil inorganic carbon is also important for water retention since naturally “limed” soils have better soil structure and rates of infiltration compared to natural acidic soils (USDA/NRCS, 1999 ). Petrocalcic horizons can have high water-holding capacity, which can be a potential source of water for plants during droughts (Duniway et al., 2007 ), which contributes to greater resilience of arid ecosystems (Duniway et al., 2010 ).  3.2 Regulating services Regulating services refer to the benefits derived from the regulation of processes in the ecosystem such as climate regulation, carbon sequestration, and water purification (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005 ). Soil inorganic carbon is important to climate regulation considering the gas exchange between terrestrial CaCO3  (pedogenic carbonate) and atmospheric CO2  (Zamanian et al., 2016 ). Pedogenic carbonate can either sequester atmospheric carbon (ecosystem service) during precipitation or release carbon to the atmosphere during dissolution (ecosystem disservice) (Monger et al., 2015 ; Zamanian et al., 2016 ). For example, when one mole of calcium reacts with two moles of atmospheric CO2 , one mole of carbon is released back into the atmosphere, resulting in one mole of carbon sequestered in the form of pedogenic carbonate (Monger et al., 2015 ). In addition, the dissolution of SIC can act as a natural buffer against water or soil acidity in the pedosphere and hydrosphere (Berner and Berner, 1996 ). For instance, soil inorganic carbon contiguous with a body of water, such as a lake, will regulate the water's pH through natural buffering (Berner and Berner, 1996 ). The dissolution of SIC can expedite erosion, causing surface collapse (Salvati and Sasowsky, 2002 ). When soil inorganic carbon buffers acidity in pedosphere and hydrosphere, alkalization occurs. Alkalization from soil inorganic carbon can naturally promote water purification (Berner and Berner, 1996 ).  3.3 Cultural services Cultural services refer to the nonmaterial benefits derived from ecosystem services such as recreation, esthetics, education, and cultural heritage (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005 ). Globally, Aridisols and Entisols approximately contain 800 × 1015  g of carbon in caliché layers, unique features of the desert ecosystems (Schlesinger, 1982 ). Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum in Tuscon provides visitors with opportunities to learn about desert soils as they relate to providing habitat for animals and growing media for desert plants (Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, 2017 ). Duniway et al. (2010)  reported the importance of carbonate-cemented soil horizons for vegetation patterns and dynamics in arid and semiarid environments.  3.4 Supporting services Supporting services refers to the benefits that are essential for all other ecosystem services such as weathering/soil formation, nutrient cycling and provisioning of habitat (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005 ). The process of weathering is important for the precipitation of pedogenic carbonate; for instance, calcium ions needed for carbonate precipitation can be from the weathering and erosion of calcareous or siliceous parent material (Monger et al., 2015 ). Also, high densities of pedogenic carbonate can be found in areas with strong weathering of calcareous parent material. In addition, weathering processes allow pedogenic carbonates to be natural providers of essential plant nutrients to the soil solution (Lal et al., 2000 ). For example, mineral weathering of calcite (CaCO3 ) and dolomite CaMg(CO3 )2  can supply both calcium (Ca2+ ) ions and magnesium ions (Mg2+ ) to soil solution (Lal et al., 2000 ). The calcium and magnesium ions weathered from soil carbonates are in available forms for plant uptake. Soil carbonates in the form of calcite can also be formed from the oesophageal glands of earthworms (Canti et al., 2015 ). The objective of this study is to assess the value of SIC: 1) at the country scale (in 12 soil orders of Soil Taxonomy within the continental United States) and 2) at the farm scale (Cornell University Willsboro Research Farm) within the context of ecosystem services, specifically provisioning and supporting services.   4 Materials and methods For the continental U.S., values for the minimum, midpoint, and maximum SIC storage and content for all soil orders (2-m soil depth) were acquired from Guo et al. (2006) . These values were converted to U.S. dollars and dollars per square meter in Microsoft Excel using the following equations:(1) $  =  SIC  Storage   g    ×  100  g  CaCO 3   12  g  SIC   × 1  lb m   453.59  g   × 1  U .

(2006)  reported for Entisols an area of 1,054,015 km2 , a midpoint SIC storage of 5112 × 106  Mg (i.e., megagrams of carbon), and a midpoint SIC content of 4.8 kg m−2 . Note that various researchers report carbon storage with different units; here the SIC storage of 5112 × 106  Mg for Entisols also can be expressed equivalently as 5112 × 1012  g, 5112 Tg (teragrams), or 5.112 Pg (petagrams). Using 5112 × 1012  g for SIC storage in Eq. (1)  together with the average price of agricultural limestone in the U.S, which according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) was $10.42 per U.S. ton in 2014 (USGS, 2016 ), results in a value of 4.89 × 1011  U.S. dollars or 489 billion U.S. dollars ($489B) (Tables 3a and 3b   ). On an area-normalized basis for Entisols, the value of SIC per square meter is $0.46 m−2  (Tables 3a and 3b ) using Eq. (2) . Note that the price values calculated in U.S. dollars and dollars per square meter represent the money that would be required to purchase agricultural limestone to match the naturally-occurring SIC levels. For the Cornell University Willsboro Research Farm, the mean total SIC storage and content data were acquired from fifty-four cores collected in the summer of 1995 (depth ranges: 30–92 cm) and also from the SSURGO soil database (depth ranges: 183–236 cm). The Cornell University Willsboro Research farm is located in Willsboro, NY (44° 22′N, 73° 26′W) in northeastern part of New York State and has highly variable soils due to glacial deposits (Mikhailova et al., 2016 ). The three soil orders present at Willsboro Research Farm are Entisols, Inceptisols and Alfisols. Mean SIC storage and content values reported by Mikhailova et al. (2016)  for the three soil orders and for the various soil map units (SMUs) present on the farm were converted to U.S. dollars and dollars per square meter in Microsoft Excel using a procedure similar to that described above with eqns. (1) and (2) . For the state of New York (NY), the average price of agricultural limestone in 2014 was reported to be $10.88 per U.S. ton (USGS, 2016 ). Using Entisols again as an example, Mikhailova et al. (2016)  reported an area of 378,691 m2  (~ 0.38 km2 ), a mean SIC storage of 3.40 × 106  kg (i.e., 3.40 × 109  g), and a mean SIC content of 8.98 kg m−2  for the Willsboro Farm based on readily-available values from the SURRGO database (Soil Survey Staff, 2015 ). Using these values together with the 2014 average NY price of limestone in Eqs. (1) and (2)  results in values of $3.40 × 105  ($0.34 M) and $0.90 m−2  (Table 4  ).  5 Results and discussion Soil inorganic carbon naturally occurring in the soil provides a substantial monetary value to the United States (Tables 3a and 3b ). If the SIC is not naturally present in the soil, then liming is possibly needed to increase soil pH and nutrient availability; however, providing lime to the soil can be an expensive endeavor and can contribute to carbon emissions worldwide (West and McBride, 2005 ). Prices for agricultural limestone vary by state: for example, the average 2014 price of agriculture limestone was $10.88 per U.S. ton in the state of New York and was $10.42 per U.S. ton when averaged across the entire country (USGS, 2016 ). On the other hand, in certain states the price for agricultural limestone will be much higher (e.g., $48.25 per U.S. ton in 2017 in the State of South Carolina, SC Department of Agriculture, 2017a, 2017b ). The value of SIC varies by soil order, storage and content. 5.1 The value of SIC at country scale (2-m depth) Total SIC storage represents the total amount of SIC in each soil order in 2 m depth shown as minimum (min), midpoint (mid), and maximum (max) (Table 3a ). Including the min, mid and max values represents the inherent uncertainty in the STATSGO-derived estimates (Helmick et al., 2014 ). Helmick et al. (2014)  found that the min and max values for a range of soil properties (e.g., organic carbon content, pH, and clay content) approximated 95% prediction intervals when compared with soil profile data. Previous research by Folberth et al. (2016)  called for improvements in soil data and accounting for soil data uncertainty in crop yield simulations. In this study the three soil orders with the highest SIC mid storage, Mollisols, Alfisols, and Aridisols, are categorized as intermediately weathered soil orders (Table 3a ). Conversely, soils with lower SIC storage are categorized as slightly weathered and strongly weathered soil orders. Across the U.S., the soil orders having the highest total midpoint value of SIC storage (based on the average $10.42 price of CaCO3  per ton), are: 1) Mollisols ($2.22T), 2) Aridisols ($1.23T), 3) Alfisols ($523B) and 4) Entisols ($489B). The value of SIC in Mollisols and Alfisols is related to the midpoint SIC storage as reported by Guo et al. (2006) . Both Mollisols and Alfisols are important agricultural soils for crop production and commonly located in the bread-basket regions (Liu et al., 2012 ). Predominant land use is grain production (maize, soybean, wheat, and sorghum) and livestock agriculture (Liu et al., 2012 ). The soil order Aridisols is ranked second in terms of SIC storage value (Table 3a ), but high contents of SIC and limited precipitation can further limit agricultural and other uses in these soils (Rasmussen, 2006 ; Eghbal and Southard, 1993 ; Bockheim and Hartemink, 2013 ). Slightly weathered Entisols have the fourth highest SIC storage value of the 12 soil orders in the United States. Soil inorganic carbon mid content (per square meter) represents the area density of SIC within the total area that each soil order occupies in the United States (Table 3b ). In terms of SIC mid content results, the soil orders are ranked: 1) Vertisols ($2.22 m−2 ), 2) Aridisols ($1.52 m−2 ), 3) Mollisols ($1.10 m−2 ), and 4) Inceptisols ($0.49 m−2 ). Vertisols are ranked highest in terms of SIC content value since Vertisols have the highest density of SIC within the amount of occupied area.  5.2 The value of SIC storage at farm scale The mean total SIC storage at the Cornell University Willsboro Research Farm was acquired from SSURGO data (Table 4 ), averaged soil core results (Table 5  ), and interpolated soil core results (Table 6  ). For the Cornell University Willsboro Research Farm, the soil orders having the highest total value of SIC (based on the average $10.88 price per U.S. ton of CaCO3 lime in NY in 2014), are: 1) Alfisols, 2) Entisols and 3) Inceptisols, which is somewhat consistent with results found at the country scale. The mean total SIC content followed similar rankings by soil order. At farm-scale, SSURGO data did not align with field data acquired from averaged and interpolated soil cores due to various reasons (e.g., soil depth, carbon data from “type location,” etc.) (Mikhailova et al., 2016 ).   6 Conclusions This study examined SIC storage and content at country scale (the continental U.S.) and farm scale (Cornell University Willsboro Research Farm) by calculating the corresponding monetary value of occurring SIC. The value of SIC is correlated with the sizes of SIC stocks, which tend to be highest in the Central Midwest-Great Plains and arid regions. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the value of SIC storage and content varies within the continental U.S at the country scale and also between specific data sources (SSURGO, averaged core results, and interpolated core results) at the farm scale. Calculating the value of SIC pools is important in ecosystem services assessment, especially provisioning and supporting services.
