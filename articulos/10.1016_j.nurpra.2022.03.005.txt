This report serves as a template for further evaluations of the importance of APNs in supporting global health policies. These findings inform how the workforce can effectively pursue these goals.   Keywords advanced nursing practice  advanced practice nursing  clinical nurse specialists  health care policy  nurse practitioners    Background Nurses make up 59% of all health professionals globally and deliver the bulk of the care.1   Nursing roles have evolved over the past 50 years, and advanced practice nurse (APN) roles have developed to address diverse communities’ health care needs and disparities. Today, more than 70 countries include the APN role in their nursing workforce.2   The APN scope of practice is considered beyond that of a generalist nurse and includes providing care to a wide range of populations to address various health care priorities. This brief report examines examples of where and how APNs contribute to global healthcare priorities according to the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG3) target indicators. The 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) came into effect in January 2016.3   These SDGs address the significant problems faced by the global population. The indicators for “Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all ages” aim to address health promotion, increase life expectancy, decrease maternal and child mortality, reduce the spread of infectious diseases, and improve the environment. 4   In 2017, the UN Statistical Commission further refined the indicators for each of the 17 SDGs. SDG3 has 13 targets and indicators. These targets and indicators reflect key global healthcare priorities. The SDG indicators metadata repository is an online resource that provides access to the latest references from the UN and other international organizations for all the SDG indicators.5   Metadata entries for each UN SDG3 target indicator have references that help identify the importance of each indicator in relation to healthcare and its delivery. Given the prevalence of APNs internationally and their contribution to healthcare delivery, a literature search was conducted to identify examples of APN initiatives that addressed UN SDG 3 during the first 5 years. Given this report’s aim, to identify examples that demonstrate how APNs have and could contribute to the achievement of the UN SDGs, a systematic literature review was not conducted. Both Medline and CINAHL databases were searched. The search was limited to English publications and the years 2015 through 2020. The keywords were “advanced practice nurse,” “clinical nurse specialist (CNS),” and “nurse practitioner (NP)” in combination with the 13 target indicators (reported in the middle column of the Table  ) of the UN’s SDG3. Publications were reviewed by title and abstract to assess their relevance to the 13 target indicators and identify the reported APN role. Examples of nursing role titles that indicated “advanced practice” and addressed keywords within the indicators of interest were selected from a list of eligible models. Not all publications identified by the initial search are used because the aim was not to provide a comprehensive summary of all relevant APN activity. Examples of APN activities supporting SDG3’s target indicators displayed in the Table  were chosen based on their relevance to the SDG3 targets and geographic spread. The latter factor was considered to demonstrate the global reach of APNs. Without this approach, this report would be heavily skewed toward examples from North America. However, the review examined articles published in English, which may have resulted in the exclusion of some reports.  Discussion From this review, it is inspiring to see the breadth and depth of APN roles globally and how they are meeting and exceeding the challenge put forward by SDG3. Roles found in the Table  highlight the value the APN role adds to the health care system. Through the delivery of care and disease prevention, these roles ensure required care is received. APNs working in various contexts use advanced skills to provide care that contributes to meeting the UN SDG 3 targets. Instances related to APN roles and direct delivery of care included SDG3.1 (reducing maternal mortality), SDG3.2 (ending preventable mortality of newborns and children under age 5 years), SDG3.3 (ending the epidemic of aids, tuberculosis, malaria, neglected tropical diseases, hepatitis, waterborne diseases, and other communicable diseases), SDG3.4 (reducing mortality related to noncommunicable diseases and promote mental health well-being), SDG3.5 (strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse), SDG3.7 (addressing universal access to sexual and reproductive health care), and SDG3.a (strengthening the implementation of tobacco control). Examples reflect a wide range in the delivery of care and regions from which the articles originated. They exemplify advanced nursing roles’ contribution to direct care priorities. Finding specific examples for the remaining SDG 3 target indicators was a more complex task. Most of the SDG targets do not directly relate to care delivery of nursing or APN practice. These indicators include SDG3.6 (reducing road traffic accidents), SDG3.8 (achieve universal health care coverage), SDG3.9 (reduce ill associated with chemical, air, water, soil pollution, and contamination), SDG3.b (support vaccine and medicines research), SDG3.c (increase health financing, recruitment training, and development of the health care workforce), and SDG3.d (strengthen early warning, risk reduction, and management of national and global health risk). Although direct care examples were found for road traffic accidents, poisoning, and preparedness for global health risks, most of the other examples were recommendations or policy stances rather than direct APN practice examples. When reviewing the current literature and how these roles can help, it is evident that nursing plays a crucial role. Care delivered by APNs has been shown to improve health outcomes and increase satisfaction among clients and health care colleagues compared with standard care.6-11   From the examples reviewed, it was also apparent that global APN roles are most relevant to clinical practice rather than the nonclinical components of SDG 3. Within the literature, there is a clear advocation for all levels of nursing to be involved in direct care and aspects such as policy, finance, and research.12-15   As such, additional work needs to be done in this area.16-37    Conclusion Nursing professionals make up the most significant portion of the health care workforce and are responsible for the majority of health care delivered to individuals. APN roles have developed and demonstrated the ability to administer care using “advanced” knowledge and skills. The UN has highlighted inequities in the living conditions of people around the world and has developed the SDGs as “an urgent call for action by all countries.” Supporting the contribution of APNs’ roles to achieving the SDG3 targets is paramount. The examples within this brief report demonstrate the variety of practices that contribute positively to the UN SDG3 target indicators. The examples highlighted demonstrate the different ways in which APNs contribute to the UN’s SDGs. Furthermore, it establishes that APNs can effectively and efficiently treat and prevent diseases such as those found within the target indicators of SDG 3. This brief report can guide workforce development and individual APN activities to further pursue these goals in various contexts.16-37      References 1 World Health Organization  State of the world’s nursing 2020: investing in education, jobs and leadership   https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240003279 2020     World Health Organization.
