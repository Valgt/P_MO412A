               Air pollution is directly as well as indirectly linked with several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Hence, focused efforts and strategies toward improving the air quality can lead to direct reduction in the adverse impacts on human health and our cities and setting climate mitigation targets. The worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has forced various governments around the world to suspend nonessential activities due to the unavailability of the vaccine. This unprecedented lockdown led to significant decline in major criteria air pollutants—PM2.5, PM10, CO, and NO2—with more than 50% decline in several cities across the world. However, SO2 did not change much over some regions, while O3 has shown some increase. The majority of these changes are well supported by the reduced pollutant emissions, primarily from vehicular sources in urban areas. A slight decline has also been observed in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during the lockdowns. The lockdown illustrates the need for a potential shift of anthropogenic activities toward a more sustainable lifestyle for ameliorating air quality and thus paving the pathway to achieve SDGs. The COVID-19-induced lockdown scenario should be exploited to understand future measures to improve air quality and mitigate the adverse health and climate effects. This chapter explores the impact of the national lockdowns on urban air quality across the globe. Learnings from this natural intervention and future policy implications toward improving air quality are further discussed.

Hence, focused efforts and strategies toward improving the air quality can lead to direct reduction in the adverse impacts on human health and our cities and setting climate mitigation targets. The worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has forced various governments around the world to suspend nonessential activities due to the unavailability of the vaccine. This unprecedented lockdown led to significant decline in major criteria air pollutants—PM2.5 , PM10 , CO, and NO2 —with more than 50% decline in several cities across the world. However, SO2  did not change much over some regions, while O3  has shown some increase. The majority of these changes are well supported by the reduced pollutant emissions, primarily from vehicular sources in urban areas. A slight decline has also been observed in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during the lockdowns. The lockdown illustrates the need for a potential shift of anthropogenic activities toward a more sustainable lifestyle for ameliorating air quality and thus paving the pathway to achieve SDGs. The COVID-19-induced lockdown scenario should be exploited to understand future measures to improve air quality and mitigate the adverse health and climate effects. This chapter explores the impact of the national lockdowns on urban air quality across the globe. Learnings from this natural intervention and future policy implications toward improving air quality are further discussed.   Keywords COVID-19  Air pollution  Lockdown  Policy  Sustainable development goals   1 Introduction Governments of the various nations across the globe had to unwillingly shut down their nonessential economic activities by declaring lockdown as an initial preventive measure to tackle the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). It has impacted millions of lives, but this number could have been worst without the lockdown. Highly populated countries such as China and India have implemented the longest lockdown spanning more than six weeks.1,2   Almost every country has implemented lockdown as their first response to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to lower the spread rate and develop the necessary health infrastructure to deal with the cases. Further, additional measures such as social distancing, lockdowns, stay-at-home orders, and mandatory use of masks in public places have been implemented by all the countries to reduce the spread of the disease.3   Air-conditioned restaurants, malls, theaters, and institutions remained closed as these places are considered to be potential spreaders. Public gatherings and religious events are banned over most of the regions, besides weddings and funerals are allowed with a very limited number of attendees.4   Nonessential small industries; information technology firms; and the air, rail, and road transport sector also stopped their operations during the lockdown. As a result, these measures led to a decline in air pollutants and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and thus air quality improvement around the world.5,6   However, this has also shown our vulnerability toward the global crisis forcing the governments as well as the scientific community to rethink our pace and choices toward sustainable life.7   Several studies across the world have quantified the significant decline in the concentrations of different air pollutants during the lockdown.1,6,8–15   Primary air pollutants, such as PM2.5 , PM10 , NO2 , and CO which are largely associated with vehicular emissions in urban areas, have observed the highest decline (> 50%) across all regions, with a higher decline in more polluted cities. One of the key regions in the air pollution study, the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), reported air quality below the permissible limits after many decades.1   Aerosols remained the highly discussed topic during the pandemic for their involvement in the spread of the virus, as evidences showed, not just the physical contact but droplets from coughing/sneezing and inhalation of small airborne particles can transmit from an infected to an uninfected person.16   A two-meter distance protocol only works when the mask is on; otherwise, even 6 m may not be enough to avoid the spread of the virus.17   Although engineering controls can prevent the spread,18   but studies have strongly suggested about airborne transmission route of COVID-19 as well.19   On the other hand, long-term exposure to bad air quality may increase the vulnerability of people with preexisting and compromised lung conditions.20,21   It has been reported that regions with higher PM2.5  could potentially result in threefold higher mortality.22   Similar risk associations have also reported during the SARS pandemic in 2003.23   A few epidemiological studies have examined the environmental conditions which could affect the spread of the virus, primarily examining the association of temperature and relative humidity with daily new cases.24–26   However, the role of meteorology on air quality vis-à-vis the effect of lockdown has been quantified by a handful of studies only.1,27   All of these choices during the lockdown affect our commitment toward 17 SDGs (169 SDGs-related targets) decided by the United Nations (UN) under the Transforming Our World: The 2030  agenda in 2015.28   Air pollution and GHGs are considered as one of the significant indicators to monitor the progress of four SDGs, which include SDG3 (Good health and well-being), SDG7 (Clean energy), SDG11 (Sustainable cities), and SDG13 (Climate actions).28,29   Two of the SDG targets explicitly highlight the importance of air pollution: SDG 3.9 targets a substantial reduction in the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water, and soil pollution and contamination by 2030, while SDG 11.6 targets reduction in the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality, municipal and other waste management.28,30   The complexity to understand the consequences of SDG-related decisions is somewhat seen during the pandemic and exploitation of the available data can help in future policy-making. Thus, to understand future measures to improve air quality and mitigate the adverse health and climate effects, it is necessary to exploit the current scenario. This chapter explores the impact of the national lockdowns on urban air quality across the globe and discusses future policy implications toward improving air quality from the learnings of this natural intervention.  2 Lockdown measures adopted around the world Affecting more than 200 countries as of Sep 07, 2020,31   the pandemic has forced every country to restrict their internal as well as external movements. Activities were only allowed locally based on the absolute essentials so that this restriction (also known as lockdown, stay-at-home, curfews, or shutdown) could reasonably reduce the spread of the virus at the initial stage and provide the governments a time window to establish and expand required health facilities. Countries such as Italy, India, China, and Mexico have declared some of the largest lockdowns in history (see Table 1  ). India recorded the biggest lockdown ever by restricting more than 1.3 billion population voluntarily in a house for “Janta Curfew ” on March 22, 2020,55   followed by six-week long strict lockdown across the country.1   However, the length of the lockdown does not represent the effective prevention of the virus spread. Some countries such as South Korea and Sweden haven’t introduced any lockdown during the pandemic,56   while countries such as Brazil35   implemented the lockdown in major cities and high-risk areas only. Chile57   and Bangladesh58   have also tried nighttime curfew to limit nocturnal movements (see Table 1 ). These lockdowns are implemented phase-wise to have a timely evaluation of the situation while considering the revival of economic activities. Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) is continuously monitoring the government policies of 180 different countries and classifying the publicly available information into 17 indicators which are further summed into four groups indicating health, economic, policy information, and overall effect.59  Fig. 1  , compiled from the OxCGRT, shows the stringency index of each country for the government policies, which is derived from the orders such as closure or restriction of school, workspace, public event, social gathering, public transport, internal movement, and international travel.59   The majority of the strict protocols by various countries have been enforced between 15th March and 15th April and followed up to June 2020. Thus the period of April–May remained the most restricted months due to overlapping lockdown orders from various governments (Fig. 2  ). China was the first country to declare nationwide lockdown and successfully prevented the spread of the virus in Wuhan using early lockdown and exhaustive testing.60   India expected to be the worst affected country, with the longest lockdown enforced by some of the state governments even after the reopening order from the central government.61   Despite strict lockdown orders in many developing countries, the daily surge of new COVID-19 cases showed unconstrained growth.62   Some studies have examined the effectiveness of these lockdowns by analyzing variability in the daily new cases, using various tools such as Growth Factor,63   Daily Incidence Proportion, Daily Cumulative Index,64   and Effective Reproduction Number.65   These studies show that the lockdown in countries like Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, Pakistan, and South Africa has failed to control the situation, where unbridled daily new cases have been observed during lockdown.62   The effectiveness of the lockdown in the aforementioned developing countries also depends on the behavior of the citizens to understand the importance of social distancing and successful confinement of the key cities to prevent rural areas from getting infected. The economy of the developing countries heavily relies on the metropolitan cities, which in some way impacted the effectiveness of the lockdown, and virus infection spread to rural regions as most of the daily wage workers migrated to their hometowns due to unemployment. The prolonged lockdown with rising daily new cases can have socioeconomic consequences, while this unprecedented disruption in the major economic activities can ignite many issues such as unemployment.66    3 Air quality during COVID-19 lockdown The economic growth of many developed and rapidly developing nations has aggravated air pollution levels, specifically in urban areas. Worsening air quality in many parts of the world is a severe threat to the human respiratory system considering the long-term exposure to the criteria air pollutants (PM2.5 , PM10 , NO2 , SO2 , CO, and O3 ).67–70   More than ~ 5 million deaths are annually attributed to air pollution.71   These emissions are mainly due to vehicular, agriculture, residential, and industrial (including power) sectors.72–76   These sources have been operating uninterrupted for many decades which has gradually degraded the air quality, but worldwide the lockdown due to the COVID-19 virus outbreak can be considered as the biggest hiatus for human activities and thus the emissions from these sources during the modern era.77   The unrestrained spread of COVID-19 with no vaccine available as of Sep 2020 forced everyone to stay indoors and the economic activities went down. As a consequence, the imposed lockdowns have provided a unique opportunity to examine the earth’s atmosphere without the emissions from major sectors.77,78   Thus this natural intervention across the globe presented a unique opportunity for the scientific community leading to numerous studies recording a marked decline in air pollution levels during the COVID-19 lockdown. A majority of these studies are from India1,8,9,12,79   and China.80–84   The air quality impact of the lockdown has also been investigated in the USA,85   Brazil,10   Malaysia,13,86   Spain,11   Pakistan,87   Kazakhstan,88   Iran,89   Tehran,90   Ecuador,91   Istanbul,92   and UK27,93   as well. The global decline in pollutants considering a common lockdown period is also analyzed by a few studies6,94   and found a similar range of pollutant changes as observed by the regional or city/country-specific studies. 3.1 Change in air quality during lockdown 3.1.1 Asia In the past few decades, (Indo-Gangetic Plain) IGP (India),95   Beijing (China),96   and Lahore (Pakistan)97   are in discussion for their particulate pollution-related issues, owing to the aforementioned sectors along with some natural aerosols such as dust from long-range transport. In Feb 2020, NASA had released the initial evidence showing the tropospheric NO2  density < 100 μmol m− 2  during the lockdown (Feb 10–25, 2020) in Wuhan, China; these values were fivefold lesser than the previous year.98   Further, NASA released NO2  and (Aerosol Optical Depth) AOD decline over the Indian region, clearly showing AOD reduction up to ~ 0.5, especially over the IGP region.98   Researchers show a significant reduction in the major criteria air pollutants which is due to the lockdown effect leading to the closure of nonessential sectors and decreased vehicular mobility on the road.1,9,79  Kumar et al.99   reported considerable reductions in PM2.5  in 5 major cities of India compared to the same period of the previous 5 years, where it reduced to 41%–53% (Delhi), 10%–39% (Mumbai), 19%–43% (Chennai), 26%–54% (Hyderabad), and 24%–36% (Kolkata). Navinya et al.1   also reported a significant decrease in postlockdown PM2.5  and PM10  in 17 cities across India. Mahato et al.79   reported a decrease of more than 50% in PM2.5  and PM10  concentrations over Delhi, India. Mitra et al.100   reported PM2.5  (39%), PM10  (60%), CO (30%), and NO2  (53%) reduction during lockdown compared to 2019 in Kolkata, India. Many of the studies have reported different estimations of air pollutant reduction in the same cities due to the variation in selection of the number of days, stations, lockdown periods, and control periods. Saadat et al.101   reported a 25% decrease in emissions at the start of the lockdown based on Chinese emission data, as coal usage decreased by 40% due to the slowdown of factories and power plants. They further estimated 11% improvement in air quality during lockdown compared to 2019 data from 330 cities of China. Major cities in China—Shanghai, Beijing, Wuhan, and Guangzhou—experienced a reduction in PM2.5  by 6.4, 9.2, 30.8, and 5.4 μg m− 3 , respectively, during the lockdown.102   Kanniah et al.103   reported a decrease in tropospheric NO2  column density (27%–34%) in most South-East Asian countries. PM2.5  and PM10  showed 23%–32% and 26%–31% decrease in urban, while 20%–42% and 28%–39% in industrial areas, respectively, compared with 2018 and 2019. A similar decrease of 40%–70% has also been observed in the AOD over urban areas of Malaysia during Mar–Apr 2020. Overall, Ahmedabad (68%), Beijing (79%), Bangalore (87%), Nagpur (91%), and Zhejiang (69%) show the largest reduction for PM2.5 , PM10 , NO2 , SO2 , and CO, respectively, while Baghdad (225%), Delhi (37%), and Singrauli (35%) show increase in the ozone levels during the lockdown in Asia (see Table 2  ).  3.1.2 North and South America NASA confirmed a 30% decline in atmospheric NO2  over Northeastern USA during the lockdown.117   A group of studies (Table 2 ) suggests that San Jose (45.0%), Las Vegas (41%), and Los Angeles (41%) showed the larger decline in PM2.5 , while sharp PM10  decline was observed over Los Angeles (57%), Las Vegas (54%), and Fresno (54%). Similar to Asia, the American continents also show a huge reduction in the atmospheric NO2 , with states such as Alabama (89%), California (89%), and Louisiana (83%) reported relatively very high reduction.85   Similarly, a prompt reduction was observed in SO2  over Quito (69%), Louisiana (61%), and Las Vegas (49%). The increase in O3  is relatively lesser than in Asia, with Salt Lake (25%), Providence (20%), and Toronto (17%) showing a slight increase in surface ozone during the lockdown (see Table 2 ).  3.1.3 Europe The Sentinel-5P, a European satellite mapped NO2  over France and nearby, confirmed a significant reduction over Milan, Paris, and Madrid.118   Similarly, NO2  reduced by 56% over Scotland, with Glasgow showing ~ 39% decline (see Table 3  ). Reduction in the PM2.5  is also significant over Vienna (57%), Paris (53%), and Scotland (48%). The highest reduction has been observed over Vienna (− 61%) for PM10 . Surprisingly, SO2  over the UK shows a significant and consistent increase by 82%–206%,27   whereas surface O3  shows a consistent increase over Europe which is in agreement with the other regions. Further, CO showed a high reduction in London (48%).94   A present review suggests that changes in the SO2  are much heterogeneous, while a consistent decline in PMs and NO2  has been observed; similarly, O3  showed an increase across the nations. As seen in Table 2 , many cities from India, China, and the USA, such as Delhi, Bangalore, Beijing, Wuhan, Lost Angeles, Louisiana, and Las Vegas, have shown significant changes in concentration. Venter et al.6   have investigated 10,000 + air quality stations and TROPOMI onboard the Sentinel-5P satellite to quantify changes in PM2.5 , NO2 , and O3  using weather benchmark model trained between 2017 and 2019 to ostracize meteorological impact on air pollution. As of 15th May 2020, NO2  and PM2.5  showed an average of 60% [48%–72%] and 31% [17%–45%] decline, respectively, while O3  showed slight increase by 4% [− 2% to 10%] over 34 countries. Except for Denmark and Australia, every country has reported a decline in NO2  with Serbia and Croatia observed the highest decline (see Fig. 3  ). Similarly, except Switzerland and Australia, all nations have shown an appreciable reduction in PM2.5 . UAE (> 40%) has recorded a maximum decline in O3 , while majority of the nations have shown a negligible or increasing effect on ozone.6     3.2 Emission sources during lockdown Many previous emission studies have firmly agreed on the sectors primarily responsible for the unhealthy air quality, where transportation,72,75   industries,102   agricultural burning,133   and residential biomass burning73,134,135   head the list. The unprecedented reduction in air pollution during the lockdown periods owes to one of these sectors. A study conducted by Le Quere et al.5   suggest that the power, industrial, surface transport, public, residential, and aviation activities changed by − 7.4%, − 19%, − 36%, − 21%, + 2.8%, and − 60%, which reduced daily CO2  emission by 17% [11%–25%] during April 2020; however, they found that the contribution to the CO2  reduction was mainly associated to the surface transport (43%), industry and power (43%), and aviation (10%) sectors. In a Google mobility report (Fig. 4  ), it can be observed that the number of visitors in the workplaces, recreational zones, parks, public transits, and grocery stores dropped by 30% or more across many nations, while mobility increased in the residential areas by 10%, as April 2020 remained the most restricted month.137   A policy brief over the Indian scenario by Phuleria and Navinya77   suggests that NO2  decline differs with the population of the city as a region with > 5 million population showed ~ 70% decline, while < 3 million showed only a 12% reduction, owing to the higher reduction in the mobility in larger cities. On the other hand, SO2  which is primarily emitted from the power plants did not show a consistent drop during the lockdown. Activities in industries and power hubs showed some decrease, while SO2  changes were not appreciable over the cities with no power plants or industry nearby.77   Some field burning events were observed over Central India, which suggests uninterrupted emissions from agricultural residue burning.138   Central Electricity Authority of India (CEA) report showed the unchanged supply of electricity to the regions with respect to the requirement; however, the overall demand for the power fell down due to the shutdown of many public places during lockdown.139   Venter et al.6   also found the change in mobility is significantly associated with country-specific NO2  but not with O3  and PM2.5 . The majority of the reduction in air pollutant concentration during the lockdown has been observed between the peak traffic hours (7–10 am and 7–10 pm), which reflects the impact from the transport sector.1   Several studies1,5,6,10,77,140   unanimously suggest that reduced vehicular activities and power demand are the major contributors for such drastic improvement in the air quality.  3.3 Change in meteorology during lockdown and its impact on air pollution Regional air pollution can also be influenced due to changes in meteorological parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed.1   However, the majority of the studies have reported the decline of major pollutants during the lockdown without considering the effect of meteorological differences.15,80,81,84,85   Navinya et al.1   examined the changes in temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed over 17 cities in India during the six-week long nationwide lockdown and found no significant difference between the lockdown and the previous year (2019) meteorology.1   The magnitude of the change during the lockdown and the previous year period in temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity were ± 3°C, ± 0.5 m s− 1 , and ± 15%, respectively.1   However, compared to the prelockdown period (Feb–Mar 2020), they observed the temperature and the wind speed to be increasing while relative humidity decreasing over India during the lockdown1   indicating the seasonal shift from premonsoon to the summer/monsoon. Fig. 5   shows the change in three major meteorological parameters over the globe for Apr 2020, the month when most countries had restricted their economic activities with the average for the same month during 2016–2019 given by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) data.95,141–144   The changes in the meteorological parameters shown in Fig. 5  agree with Navinya et al.1   for India. However, the changes in the meteorological conditions across the world seem heterogeneous—India, China, Eastern Europe, and Western Canada show a decrease in the temperature, while Northern Africa, Mexico, Western Australia, and central Russia show an increase. As temperature and relative humidity are inversely related, an opposite trend was observed for relative humidity, while the wind speed changed in a range of ± 1 m s− 1  over lands, where India, China, Australia, and the USA experienced a decrease; meanwhile, Canada, Middle East, and Northern Europe observed gain (See Fig. 5 ). As these meteorological changes were very small over the land, they do not seem to influence any large-scale air pollution declines across every region of the world. Hence it is very likely that these meteorological changes are not playing a vital role in air quality decline during lockdown.145   It is accepted that the low temperature and wind speed and high relative humidity support stagnation of the air, which could lead to higher pollutant concentrations.9   Although the regions like India observed such conditions during April 2020; however, the PMs concentration remained ~ 50% lower than the previous years1,8,9,12   indicating the strong impact of the lockdown over and above the meteorological differences. Additional discussion on the effect of air pollution and meteorology on COVID-19 effects has been provided in the following section.   4 Environmental cofactors during COVID-19 4.1 Meteorology suitability for COVID-19 spread The earlier virus outbreaks such as SARS and influenza have been studied for understanding their growth under particular weather conditions and the seasonal variability in the daily new cases. The meteorological changes during the lockdown are not just important to understand the impact of slowed economic activities and influence over air quality decline, but it has a major contribution toward the growth and spread of the virus, as a specific combination of the temperature and humidity can affect the survival of the virus. In a retrospective study that has analyzed the postevent information of the SARS outbreak, a temperature between 16°C and 28°C is suggested to support the growth of the SARS virus.146   Another study showed that the risk of influenza could significantly increase in low temperature and humidity, while the diurnal temperature range (DTR) positively linked with the infection rate.147   A few other studies have also reported that the temperature,148   DTR,149   and humidity150   can simulate the spread rate of the respiratory viruses. In order to understand early outbreaks, experts across the globe started investigating the spread rate of COVID-19 under various temperatures and relative/absolute humidity conditions. The correlation coefficient with lag and generalized additive models (GAM) are used to examine the relation between daily surge and meteorological conditions. Contrasting findings are reported regarding the influence of the meteorological parameters on the spread of COVID-19 (see Table 3 ). The disagreement among these studies can be attributed to the time period considered, lockdown measures, and average temperature for that region (see Table 3 ). The tropical regions such as Indonesia and India reported a positive correlation between the temperature and COVID-19 spread,119,122,151   while global studies showed that the cool and dry condition supports spread of the virus.121,124,128   Mecenas et al.25   reviewed the major published articles on the subject and concluded that the hot and wet conditions would suppress the virus spread; however, the quality of the results is graded low.25   As the outbreak is still not under control, it could get worse as the Northern Hemisphere approaches toward winter.  4.2 Air pollution, a catalyst As 90% of the world’s population lives where air quality standards exceed WHO limits, air pollution remains the biggest culprit when it comes to the deaths related to respiratory system failure, with annually ~ 4.2 million deaths worldwide attributed to the exposure to outdoor air pollution.71   During the SARS outbreak in 2003, the effect of aerosols was examined and it was found that regions with the worst air quality had high mortality.23   Similarly, many studies have examined the COVID-19 mortality with long-term exposure to PM2.5 , PM10 , and NO2 , as it could develop an inflammatory condition of the lungs.21,152–157   A preexisting inflammatory lung condition due to exposure to poor air quality, with coexisting COVID-19 infection, could be fatal; thus, many studies have quantified the share of air pollution in the COVID-19 mortality during the pandemic across the world. Statistical tools such as generalized additive model153  , simple linear regression,158   multiple linear regression,154,156,159   and correlation coefficients24,152,155,160,161   are used to understand share of air pollution in COVID-19 mortality. Wu et al.22   have reported that US counties were having average PM2.5  < 8 μg m− 3  and > 8 μg m− 3  have an average death rate of 1.6 and 4.7 (per 100,000), respectively, thus attributing a unit increase in long-term PM2.5  exposure to 15% increase in COVID-19 death rate. Similarly, Italian region showed a strong association of PM2.5  and COVID-19 deaths (R 2  = 0.53).160   Strengthening the argument, Ogen (2020) reported 83% of COVID-19 deaths to be associated with the regions having NO2  more than 100 μmol m− 3 . However, a city-based study over Milan152,155   and California24   showed a negative association between air pollution and COVID-19 mortality, which can be plausibly explained by the nonconsideration of socioeconomic indicators.24   A 10 μg m− 3  increase in PM2.5 , PM10 , and NO2  attributes to 2.24%, 1.76%, and 6.94% increase, respectively, in daily new cases over 120 cities of China, considering wind speed, RH, temperature, and city as covariates.153   Parallel to earlier studies, Li et al.158   have found a significant positive correlation between the daily confirmed new cases and PM2.5  (R 2  = 0.23), PM10  (0.158), and NO2  (0.158) over Xiaogan and Wuhan. Spatial association between confirmed infections and air pollutants such as PM2.5  (R 2  = 0.34), PM10  (R 2  = 0.27), and NO2  (R 2  = 0.25) are also reported by Fattorini and Rengoli (2020). Many studies that have used spatial data homogeneously concluded that long-term exposure to poor air quality could be lethal if coexist with COVID-19 infection.21,22,159–161   Evidences suggested that COVID-19 mortality and morbidity are strongly associated with PM2.5  and NO2 , while to some extent PM10 , illustrating the impracticality of a larger particle to reach type II alveolar cells.157   A decreased NO2  and PM2.5  helped to avoid 8911 [6950 10,866] and 3214 [2340 4087] deaths from cardiovascular diseases during the lockdown in China, which outnumbered COVID-19-related deaths (4633 as of May 4, 2020), that suggest air pollution control-related policies and laws could be more helpful toward avoiding future deaths.162     5 Preventive policies for COVID-19 spread and air pollution Use of alcohol-based sanitizers, social distancing up to 6 ft, avoiding crowded places, use of masks, keeping hygiene, avoid touching the face, and lockdowns are some of the preventive measures advised by the WHO to reduce the spread of COVID-19.163   Many countries have made it mandatory to follow the aforementioned advisory and penalized for noncompliance.164,165   Rapid task forces have been established to track potential spread to avoid community transfer in many countries. Individual tracking applications (e.g., Aarogya Setu  by India) have been developed to keep a record of infected persons and notifying users if a potential spreader is nearby.166   However, multidimensional aspects of the pandemic need to be considered to effectively control the spread, contain morbidity and mortality, and revive economic activities. 5.1 Post-COVID-19 preventive measures Reduced anthropogenic emissions during the lockdown have flourished the environment, but climate change is not totally arrested. Besides, the economic growth is severely hampered, and the livelihoods of millions of people (more so the poorest of the poor) across the globe are affected. However, this temporary decline in air emissions gave an opportunity to revisit national and global policies to improve air quality, avoid climate crises, and to reduce susceptibility toward such future global crises. The pandemic has also allowed us to examine our pace to adapt to any global change. For many decades scientists have been apprising the deaths associated with air pollution, but seriousness toward this issue, in low- and middle-income countries, in particular, remained low. About 1 million deaths (as of Sep 2020) during the ~ 8 months of a pandemic are four times lesser than the fatalities (~ 4.2 million annually) due to air pollution71   and thus warranting concerted global efforts and attention to reduce air pollution. Masks have become a new normal during the pandemic, although these are enforced by the regional authorities to minimize and slow down the spread, but now people are understanding its significance. However, wearing a mask would also help to reduce air pollution exposure to a certain degree. Thus the practice of using a mask in high-exposure environments, especially by those who are more susceptible, e.g., asthmatics, could be promoted even after the pandemic and will require a similar level of awareness campaign. However, these are short-term measures only and governments need to rethink about the post-COVID-19 policies to accommodate future global crises such as climate change and health effects due to air pollution. Activities such as agricultural burning that influences the regional air quality for considerable months every year need to be discouraged and alternate usage of the agricultural waste need to be identified. Similarly, Ujjwala Yojana, to provide clean cooking gas by the Government of India, needs to be accelerated to reduce the residential emissions due to solid biomass cookstoves.167   Emissions from the transport and industrial sector are likely to go up as government removes the lockdown restriction to revive the economy after controlling the COVID-19 situation. This sudden increase in the emissions due to a drastic shift in the demand as offices and institutes open would reasonably compensate for what has been achieved during the lockdown. The transport sector may feel higher pressure due to such change in demand, resulting in overloaded vehicles, longer routes to travel. Similarly, the nonessential industries which were closed or working with minimal employees will gradually shift toward a normal working load as COVID-19 comes under control. Open street waste burning for campfires, especially in rural regions, will also start as curfew eased. Many economic and social activities will trend toward normalcy; thus, emissions will also reach to prelockdown levels.77   Sustainable mitigation options such as work from home, public transport, promoting electric or hydrogen vehicles, and stringency toward solid waste burning are needed to be considered in the post-COVID-19 world.77   Encouraging green industries, scrapping the old vehicle, eliminating harmful chemicals, and more subsidies to renewable plants can be also pivotal to reduce air pollution while reviving the economy (see Table 4  ).167   The gain in the air quality will be lost soon as the restrictions will be eased, and the industrial production and commercial activities will boost to compensate for the economic loss during the lockdown.168   Post-COVID-19 higher emissions and their interaction with the winter-time low temperatures could be critical,169   as more evidences are supporting airborne transmission and the link between air quality and mortality. In addition, cold and dry regions are considered to be favorable for the long-term survival of the virus,25   with low immunity during winter.170   These call for better preparedness toward the threat of COVID-19 under the favorable environmental conditions for the virus survival, spread, and potency.   6 Conclusions COVID-19, since it is observed first in Wuhan, China, has claimed ~ 1 million lives as of Sep 27, 2020, despite global measures including strict lockdowns for several weeks. However, this number could have been worse without such preventive steps. Major developed and developing countries such as the USA, China, Italy, India, and Mexico chose to restrict their nonessential economic activities to avoid the unconstrained spread of the virus. The majority of the countries closed mobility within and out of the country by restricting transport and vehicular activities, IT hubs, shopping malls, parks, and even government offices. Thus Apr 2020 remained globally the idlest month due to overlapping lockdowns of many countries. Numerous studies across the world have unanimously confirmed a decline in air pollution levels, especially for the PM2.5 , PM10 , and NO2 , while SO2  showed a heterogeneous response mainly attributed to the thermal power generation sources nearby, whereas surface O3  showed a slight but consistent increase. These changes are strongly associated with the reduced anthropogenic activities, especially road transport activities as evident by the empty roads during the lockdown everywhere. Highly polluted regions of Asia such as IGP showed significant improvement in the air quality, as well as, cleaner regions of Europe and the USA also reported similar changes. The decline in the pollution levels was observed despite the usual contribution from other anthropogenic sources such as power plants, agricultural burning, and residential biomass burning and other natural sources during the lockdown, highlighting the relatively large impact of transportation sources and commercial activities on urban air quality. These changes helped climate and environment-related SDGs to gain progress; however, the duration is very short, in particular for climate-related gains and air pollutant emissions quickly reached back to prelockdown levels once the lockdown was lifted or restrictions were eased. Meteorological changes during the lockdown seem low and heterogeneous to initiate such large and consistent air pollution decline. Though the lockdown provides a very short-term draconian solution toward improving air quality, it severely affected the economic growth and livelihoods of millions of people across the world; hence, learning from this natural experiment can be exploited to frame future sustainable policies to mitigate global crises such as human health. Other factors such as meteorological suitability for virus spread and preexisting lung conditions likely due to prolonged exposure to poor air quality have influenced the regional mortality and morbidity of COVID-19. The role of meteorology indicates mixed effects, e.g., studies using global data find cool and dry places supporting virus spread, while studies over tropical regions show a positive correlation between temperature and COVID-19 spread rate. However, the general acceptance is that hot and humid conditions will suppress the spread. Similarly, regions with higher pollution indicate higher mortality, and it is likely that the preexisting lung conditions due to prolonged exposure to air pollution make us more susceptible to COVID-19 infection and death. COVID-19 pandemic has shown our vulnerability toward the global crisis and questioned our pace toward achieving SDGs. Air quality and GHG reduction helped SDGs to gain some benefits but for a short duration; however, the experience gained during the lockdown could help to revise policies and our progress to meet SDG commitments. Moreover, air pollution acted as a catalyst during such pandemics and likely made high exposed populations more susceptible to corona virus infection and fatality. This reflects the importance of meeting SDGs to make humans less susceptible to such global crises, and more so for the low- and middle-income countries. Governments of various countries need to keep the future global crisis in their mind while restoring the economic activities, as the cost of overcoming the crisis could be more than the cost of prevention. Hence, future policies need to be built on current experiences, and perhaps concerted efforts are needed toward renewable energy, sustainable industrial production, and smart and efficient transportation.
