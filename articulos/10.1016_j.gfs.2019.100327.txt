Keywords Africa  Agri-food systems  Biofortification  Corn  Nutrition  SDGs    1 Introduction 1.1 The Sustainable Development Goals The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were developed by the United Nations with Member States to “transform our world”. The seventeen SDGs include the challenges that we face in regard to poverty, inequality, climate, environmental degradation, prosperity, peace, justice, and their interactions (Table 1  ) (Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs), 2016 ). The word “sustainable” is used to define a system in which the environment is maintained, and resources are not depleted or damaged over time; “sustainability” is the process of maintaining environmental balance, in which resources, investments, development, and institutional change are in harmony to enhance health and meet human needs (Humanities Education Centre, 2009 ). The global food system plays a central role in the achievement of the SDGs. The world's major staple crops, i.e., maize, wheat, and rice, must be sustainably produced and contribute to human health and wellbeing to achieve these goals. A food system, in general, refers to all the activities related to producing, processing, distributing, preparing, and consuming the food, in addition to socio-economic and environmental aspects (High Level Panel of Experts (HLPE), 2107). The term “agro-food system” includes all inputs and outputs needed to ensure healthy food production. The aim of this paper is to use a multidisciplinary approach to assess maize agro-food system sustainability as a case study of a single staple crop in efforts to realize the SDGs. Several SDG targets overlap and they will be linked together in the case of the agro-food system (Table 2  ) and its effects on humans, animals, and the environment with the goals of securing global food security and improving nutrition and health (Fig. 1  ).  1.2 History, culture, and global diffusion The word “maize” is thought to be derived from the ancient word “mahiz ” from an extinct Arawakan language, Taino , of the indigenous people of pre-Hispanic America (Bonavia, 2013 ). Archeological evidence indicates Mexico's ancient Mayan, Aztec, and Olmec civilizations depended on maize as the basis for their diet and it was their most revered crop (Bonavia, 2013 ). The origin and cultivation of maize in Mexico became a large part of the cultural identity in this region, persisting through present day. Many artifacts from indigenous communities in Central America show the importance of maize through symbolism and inclusion in jewelry, artwork, and other craft items. Maize appears in creation stories and religious murals throughout Latin America. The Mayan creation story of Popol Vuh tells of the creator deity who made the first humans out of maize (Goetz and Morley, 1954 ). Maize naturally moved in trade routes throughout the Americas and became embedded in cultures up and down the New World (Bedoya et al., 2017 ). It became an important food crop to Native Americans, as part of their “Three Sisters” (i.e., maize, squash, and beans) (Mt. Pleasant, 2016 ). Maize moved throughout South America, where the staple is consumed in a wide range of traditional dishes such as tamales  and arepas  in Colombia and Venezuela, indio viejo  and guirilas  in Nicaragua, humitas  in Bolivia and Chile, and locro  in Argentina. In the 1500s, maize made its way across the Atlantic to Africa, likely brought by the Portuguese sailors' mid-trading route. European traders are also responsible for introducing maize to Asia (Ranum et al., 2014 ). In the 500 years and many generations which followed maize's arrival in Africa, the crop secured its place as an integral cereal across the continent. Maize now accounts for over 50 percent of local diets in Southern and Eastern Africa and is the main crop of many smallholder farmers (McCann, 2001 ). Currently, the U.S., China, and Brazil are the three top maize producing countries (Ranum et al., 2014 ). Throughout Africa, decorticated and degermed maize flour is boiled into stiff porridge, which is mainly consumed with side dishes, and is a key staple to many. This porridge is called mealie pap  in South Africa and Lesotho, sadza  in Zimbabwe, ugali  in Kenya and Tanzania, nshima  in Zambia and Malawi, and has many other names throughout the continent (McCann, 2009 ). In Malawi, where 60 percent of all calories consumed come from maize and 90 percent of cultivated land is dedicated to production, the most popular variety is called chimango ndi moyo,  which translates to “maize of the ancestors” (McCann, 2001 ; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), 2012 ). This sense of ancestral ownership of maize is common in Africa, with imagery of maize incorporated into rituals and oral tradition. The oral history of the Akan people of the Gold Coast discourages the consumption of maize on Tuesdays in respect to Bosommuru , a revered river god who carries maize as a totem. In Yoruba folk tales, maize appears as a mysterious stranger that participates in the stories. Maize has been found in traditional ceramic pottery designs of several groups in western Africa, where cobs are rolled into pottery to give it a distinct pattern (Meyerowitz, 1951 ; McCann, 2001 ). Preserving the cultural heritage of maize in countries throughout the world supports SDG11.   2 Maize and its importance in global food security and nutrition 2.1 Food security The first SDG aspires to eradicate poverty in all forms. If achieved, this goal will have far-reaching effects on many other SDGs. As incomes rise, people can focus more on improving health and sustainability outcomes because food security is met. For example, when the income of people living in extreme poverty increases, they often choose to spend the extra on food, which contributes to SDG2 by ending hunger, achieving food security, and preventing undernutrition (IAEG-SDGs, 2016 ). Food security is attained “when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life” (FAO, 2006 ). The basis of achieving food security lies in strong agricultural and food production systems, which affect availability and affordability, as well as dietary quality and diversity. At a minimum, food security includes availability, access, utilization, and stability at all times. As an agro-food staple, the contribution of maize to successfully achieve food security and meeting SDG2 is paramount (Nuss and Tanumihardjo, 2010 ). Maize is among the three most important staple crops in the world, providing almost half of the daily energy to Africa and the Americas (Table 3  ). The demand for maize with increasing populations will require dramatic increases in production, sustainability, and resilience of maize-based farming systems (Shiferaw et al., 2011 ). Shifts in maize demand have also occurred due to climatic factors. For example, maize became important in Ethiopia during drought periods and continues to expand due to improved varieties, enhanced farmer access, and growing market demand (Abate et al., 2015 ).  2.2 Maize nutrition and nixtamalization The nutritional aspects and processing of maize into food products have been extensively reviewed (Nuss and Tanumihardjo, 2010 ; Suri and Tanumihardjo, 2016 ). Sustainable development in Africa and some parts of Latin America will continue to depend on maize as a reliable source of energy and nutrition. Of the 23 countries that heavily rely on maize as a staple food, 16 are in Africa (McCann, 2001 ). However, maize is naturally lacking in several essential amino acids and in the B-vitamin niacin (Krivanek et al., 2007 ). Nixtamalization is a culinary practice in which maize is cooked with an alkalizing substrate, such as lime, heated, and then cooled over the course of several hours. This process makes maize easier to grind into dough for tortillas, a major staple in the traditional Mexican diet, and changes the chemical composition of the endosperm, improving the bioavailability of niacin, increasing resistant starch, and altering organoleptic properties (Bressani and Scrimshaw, 1958 ). Archeologists believe the practice began in the Americas over 2500 years ago, determined by the presence of grinding stones called metate  that were used to crush nixtamalized maize into dough called masa , and further cooked in a clay pan called comal  (Bonzani, 2006 ). In Mexico and some countries in Central America, nixtamalization is considered an essential factor in the consumption of maize because it changes its culinary and sensory qualities and few foods use non-nixtamalized whole-grain maize. This process has not been adopted in African countries where maize is an important staple food, offering an opportunity for future research and application to determine acceptance and potentially improve nutritional value (Ekpa et al., 2018 ). The process of nixtamalizing maize to ‘unlock’ B vitamins is crucial when maize is a dietary staple. Historically, when maize was relied on as a staple food but nixtamalization was not present, the niacin deficiency disease pellagra occurred, characterized by rashes, gastrointestinal distress, and dementia. At pellagra's peak during the Great Depression in the U.S., it was cited as the cause of death of 7000 Americans annually in groups that depended on maize for food (Clay et al., 2017 ).  2.3 Maize processing and its impact on health Diets that are high in refined grains are not considered healthy because major losses of nutrients and fiber occur during processing (Willett et al., 2019 ). High carbohydrate intakes that are not balanced with physical activity, are associated with weight gain, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Maize undergoes many different processing steps that differ around the world (Nuss and Tanumihardjo, 2010 ). Maize foods that use the whole grain are healthier options and should be promoted to retain nutritional value. During processing at centralized factories, maize can be fortified with micronutrients (Ranum et al., 2014 ). Healthy dietary patterns should consist of foods from all food groups, but allow choices for food preferences and differences among cultures (Willett et al., 2019 ).  2.4 Biofortification to improve nutrient content Maize, among other crops, has been a target for biofortification efforts, which aim to enhance the availability of essential amino acids through the production of quality protein maize (Krivanek et al., 2007 ) and the micronutrients vitamin A (through provitamin A carotenoids), iron, and zinc using a variety of techniques (Bouis and Saltzman, 2017 ). Significant progress has been made on quality seed production and provitamin A content of biofortified maize varieties currently available (Tanumihardjo et al., 2017 ). Maize is an appropriate vehicle for delivering provitamin A carotenoids because the biosynthetic pathway is established in many genotypes and large quantities of maize are consumed in target countries (Nuss and Tanumihardjo, 2010 ). Most efforts with maize have used traditional breeding techniques and contribute to SDG2 in maintaining the diversity of the seed supply and ensuring sustainable agriculture (IAEG-SDGs, 2016 ). However, modern techniques, including genetic modification and editing, could open opportunities for the maize value chain while contributing to the nutritional content of the kernels. In addition to maize breeders, seed distributors, agronomists, grain millers, nutritionists, food scientists, and consumers need to be included during developmental and production stages (Tanumihardjo et al., 2017 ). The engagement of stakeholders from multiple sectors is needed to determine where nutrition goals and biofortified varieties fit into the maize agro-food system, which needs to be sensitive to nutrition in order to achieve the development goals of stakeholders and institutions (Jaenicke and Virchow, 2013 ; Ruel et al., 2018 ). Food insecurity and undernutrition are interrelated (Tanumihardjo et al., 2007 ). In addition to having enough, food needs to be nutritionally adequate to support the needs of a healthy life. The goals of nutritionists and public health scientists are to ensure that people increase dietary diversity, diet quality, and the number of different food groups consumed on a regular basis. In the meantime, improving the nutritional quality of staple foods through biofortification and processed foods through fortification can fulfill nutrient gaps. Improving nutritional diet quality is important in making an impact on health outcomes throughout the life cycle, from gestation to the next generation (Heying et al., 2013 ).   3 The importance of maize in different socio-economic groups and gender influences 3.1 Smallholder farmers Smallholder farmers produce food for their family's livelihood and may also cultivate cash crops. Improving food and nutrition security must address sustainable agricultural productivity and the incomes of smallholder farmers. The majority of the world's poor live in rural areas, and maize in Africa and Latin America is largely produced by smallholder farmers, with large commercial farms in Southern Africa contributing less than 30 percent of total production (Enzama, 2016 ). In order to ensure sustainable food systems in populations with many smallholder farmers, there needs to be equal access to land, resources, and knowledge among women, indigenous people, and family farmers. Both SDGs 1 and 2 address basic ownership of land to assist in economic growth, eradication of poverty, and ending hunger. SDG5 specifically addresses gender equality and the empowerment of women. An essential target of SDG5 is to give women access and control over land and other forms of property (IAEG-SDGs, 2016 ).  3.2 The role of women in maize production systems Gender roles are key determinants in the distribution of responsibilities and resources between women and men. On average, women comprise 43 percent of the agricultural labor force in low- and middle-income countries, ranging from 20 percent in Latin America to 50 percent in sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia (Quisumbing et al., 2014 ; State of Food and Agriculture Team and Doss, 2011 ). Among the greatest constraints and vulnerabilities that poor women farmers face are gender stereotypes, social restrictions, and lack of information concerning value chains. When addressing gender differences and inclusion of different social groups, understanding how agro-food systems operate is important for analyzing opportunities and solutions. Women's empowerment is important for them to participate in agriculture, access and control resources, and adopt new agricultural technologies (Ruel et al., 2018 ). Reducing inequality in global markets is part of SDG10 by monitoring and improving legislation and policies (IAEG-SDGs, 2016 ). One way to address gender and social inclusion is to evaluate agriculture as a social practice because gender roles are not fixed, but are changeable and shaped by ideology, religion, ethnicity, education, culture, and tradition (Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC, 2015)). Gender analysis provides a basis for robust inquiry of the different roles that women and men play in a farming system (SDC, 2015 ). Education and reducing discrimination are key factors in supporting gender equity and are further encompassed in SDGs 4 and 5 (Table 1 ). Gender stereotypes and social restrictions influence women's roles and livelihoods in agro-food systems, especially their willingness to adopt new varieties for food preparation (SDC, 2015 ; Gunaratna et al., 2016 ). While both men and women farmers value grain yield and stress resilience, several studies show that women and men have different preferences for certain varieties and their corresponding agronomic and consumer characteristics (Christinck et al., 2017 ). The intended maize production objectives vary because of characteristics demanded by the market, home consumption, and animal feeds. Men tend to prefer high-yielding varieties to potentially sell surplus (Christinck et al., 2017 ). Women, on the other hand, are often interested in maize's culinary, processing, and nutritional qualities; long-term storability; and vulnerability to shocks, such as climate variability and depletion of the natural resource base. Thus, gender-sensitive breeding approaches are necessary to ensure new varieties fulfill the demands of the production system from farmers to end-users. While women provide labor, in many populations where maize is a staple, they may have less control over decision-making on agricultural practices, technology adoption, marketing, and income (O'Brien et al., 2016 ). Information is often important to women, whether or not they are the final decision makers on which seed, fertilizer, or other inputs to purchase (Christinck et al., 2017 ). Women also may have less quality contact with agricultural extension services (O'Brien et al., 2016 ). Often limited in time due to other family responsibilities, they may not participate in research and extension programs, farmer participatory experiments, demonstrations, and field days. In many cultures, women are traditionally regarded as the custodians of the family diets, which influences their priorities towards selecting varieties that are palatable and nutritious for their children (HLPE, 2017 ).   4 Agricultural production, farming system diversification, and transport 4.1 Maize prices, poverty alleviation, and food security Agricultural improvements are viewed as the foundation for economic prosperity and social development. Eradicating poverty and reaching SDG1 must include improved agricultural outputs. However, agricultural productivity in sub-Saharan Africa has not kept pace with population growth and many households are still food insecure (Ekpa et al., 2018 ). The price of maize influences food security among those who are net consumers (Denning et al., 2009 ). Maize prices and demand for exports are largely determined by the market. Price decline conveys important benefits to low-income urban households and to rural households that are net food consumers. The current low price of maize, relative to other cereals, increases its accessibility and utilization by the poor. However, such low prices can negatively impact farmers who depend on maize sales for income. Governments recognize the role that agriculture has in stimulating economic growth and reducing rural poverty. Sustainable agro-food production systems and resilient agricultural practices reduce hunger and food insecurity for farmers and consumers. During the 1970s and 1980s, efforts to reduce poverty were made through direct subsidies to reduce fertilizer prices for smallholder farmers, government-financed credit programs, centralized fertilizer distribution, and controlled markets (Denning et al., 2009 ). While maize productivity increased in Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Zambia, it was not sustained due to structural changes and donor involvement that reduced or abolished subsidies leading to higher fertilizer costs (Denning et al., 2009 ). Governments in Rwanda and Uganda have focused on maize as a priority sector to stimulate economic growth and promote food security (Achterbosch et al., 2014 ). By prioritizing maize as a cash crop, governments hoped to enhance gross domestic product through expanding exports and increasing labor opportunities. In 2010, Uganda, the third-largest exporter of maize in Africa, prioritized maize in their Development Strategy and Investment Plan developed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry & Fisheries. Uganda has been the source of foreign investment in maize farming because of favorable growing conditions and in the trading segments of the value chain (Daly et al., 2016 ). Exportation of maize is part of SDG8, which supports trade in the least developed countries (IAEG-SDGs, 2016 ). It is expected that the crop sectors in Africa will continue to dominate agricultural economic growth and production. This is in line with economic productivity that is encompassed by SDG8 through diversification, technological development, and sustainable employment (IAEG-SDGs, 2016 ). Despite continuous improvements in global crop yields, chronic food insecurity and malnutrition exist, with one in three people estimated to be malnourished (HLPE, 2017 ). Many constraints are faced by low- and middle-income countries due to limited access to higher-yielding and drought/heat-tolerant varieties, poor agronomic and post-harvest practices, and other drivers. Moreover, increases in input prices, such as fertilizer, impose great hardship on poor smallholder farmers (Denning et al., 2009 ). Through improved access and support from various agencies and organizations, improvements in maize grain quality stabilize prices that will help smallholder farmers. Sustainable increases in agricultural production are hindered by diverse challenges and barriers in some countries. The most critical challenges include lack of resources including insufficient inputs for scaling up production, lack of infrastructure, changing demographics, lack of management policies, increased global meat production, and socio-cultural factors. It will be necessary to monitor, evaluate, and determine these country-level challenges and barriers in order to effectively implement the desired framework to ensure production and mitigate risks.  4.2 Maize value chains, changes in demand, and opportunities Interest in maize value chains has stimulated investments and increased yields, fueling employment opportunities for vulnerable population groups, especially women and youth. This is especially important because a large share of the rural population may be affected due to loss of jobs, wage reductions, or harvest failures during poor growing seasons (Achterbosch et al., 2014 ). Investments that ultimately lead to rural development and enhance and promote farmers’ work can help to mitigate migration from rural to urban areas, with its associated pressures on urban development as covered in SDG11. The promotion of maize value chains helps to ensure a continuous and adequate supply of quality maize, especially for people relying on it for their daily consumption. Equally important is to recognize and pay for sustainable production of quality maize. With adequate and accessible supplies, the price will become more affordable for low-income families. Furthermore, the maize value chain for biofortified varieties specifically requires a multidisciplinary approach, such as outlined in SDG17, to mobilize and share knowledge, expertise, and technology (IAEG-SDGs, 2016 ). Cultures have created a fusion of foods that allow people to appreciate dietary diversity, and shape consumer preferences that lead food retailers and supermarkets to provide a myriad of food choices. Food choices have been shifting as a direct outcome of economic development. Economic growth spurs the rapid spread of more formal supermarkets and fast food chains that shape the preferences in people's diets and enable many to access animal source foods (HLPE, 2017 ), such as milk, eggs, and meat, the production of which often uses maize as an input. Socio-cultural factors are critical to address because they affect changes in eating patterns, food production, and availability. Nonetheless, selecting appropriate varieties of maize for popular meal preparation varies among populations and is important because preferences for maize and maize-based foods differ, especially across Africa and the Americas (De Groote et al., 2014 ). Furthermore, these trends in food preferences and choices are contributing to increased rates of overweight and obesity, even in populations that simultaneously experience undernutrition (HLPE, 2017 ), leading to increased risks for non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, which are covered by SDG3. Consumption of whole grain offers benefits, but challenges exist in developing acceptable food products. Changing the global food supply to include greater balance among staples and other foods, such as fruits and vegetables, requires more crop-neutral agricultural policies instead of the bias towards cereal crops, including maize (Pingali, 2015 ).  4.3 Crop technology, infrastructure, and transport As the rural poor are often confined to living in conditions in which they are exposed to multiple environmental and social uncertainties and dynamics, the outcomes of introducing crop technologies are often unpredictable. Crop technologies, including improved seed, crop management, and storage, have important roles in raising sustainable agricultural productivity. New advances in industrialization need to be innovative, as stated in SDG9. Farmers and consumers have demanded high-yielding, stress tolerant, healthy, nutritious, and market-responsive maize varieties. Nonetheless, skilled advice regarding the combination and use of different technologies is often not available for new varieties or pest and weed control. Government-supported agricultural advice is often limited by government investment in agricultural advisory services (Denning et al., 2009 ). Maize supply is diverse across the world, from large-scale mechanized farms that supply global markets to smallholder farmers that procure their own food needs and supply local markets. Poor roads and high transport costs make it difficult for low-income households that rely primarily on agriculture. Essential storage infrastructure and transport systems between rural and urban areas, which are part of SDGs 9 and 11, need to be affordable and of high quality to mitigate post-harvest losses and ensure sustainability and resilience (IAEG-SDGs, 2016 ). This is a particularly important consideration for consumers in Southern and Eastern African countries, where regional and trans -border needs affect economic development. As a result, trade is concentrated in countries in close geographic proximity because transportation costs impair competitiveness. For example, Uganda exports its surplus maize flour to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and South Sudan, while Rwanda exports low quality flour to the DRC and Burundi (Daly et al., 2016 .).   5 Assessment of alternatives for improving the nutritional efficiency of maize agro-food systems 5.1 Genetic resources for improvement Although not directly inherent in the short title for SDG2, i.e., “Zero Hunger”, one of SDG2's targets is to maintain genetic diversity of the global seed supply and manage regional and international seed banks (IAEG-SDGs, 2016 ). This includes access to and sharing genetic resources using traditional knowledge, dissemination, and international protocols and regulations. Mining maize genetic resources will become increasingly important to develop new varieties adapted to changing environments and climates. The impacts of climate change and the growing scarcity of water and land in sub-Saharan Africa need to be addressed as stated in SDGs 6 and 13 (IAEG-SDGs, 2016 ). Nutrition improvement through genetic mining will ensure that nutrient traits are not lost as new varieties are developed to tackle other issues, such as pest and disease resistance or climate change. While elevated atmospheric CO2  concentrations are expected to reduce the nutrient content of key crops such as rice, wheat, and legumes, maize may be less affected by climate change (Myers et al., 2014 ).  5.2 Soil fertility Increased agricultural productivity can drive rural development and employment opportunities as stressed in SDG8. The quality of land on which maize is cultivated influences crop quality. Soil needs good effective depth, optimal moisture, internal drainage, and balanced chemical and nutrient content. Responsible conservation and management efforts to increase productivity of agricultural land, while preserving forests, must foster biodiversity and maintain healthy ecosystems as covered in SDG15 (IAEG-SDGs, 2016 ). Smallholder and resource-limited farmers often apply manure and small quantities of fertilizer to their fields to improve yields and maintain soil quality. This addition exacerbates weed growth, often requiring labor-intensive hand-weeding, frequently by women, when alternative weed control strategies are not available or affordable. While contributing to increased production yields and replenishing soil nutrient deficiency, fertilizer raises production costs among users (Alene et al., 2008 ). In the most food-insecure regions of Kenya, 87 percent of smallholder farmers did not use fertilizers due to cost constraints (Denning et al., 2009 ). Since the 1990s, smallholder farmers in Kenya have used increasing amounts of fertilizer attributed to four factors: (1) stable market policies leading to rapid expansion of private fertilizer distribution; (2) reduction in the physical distance between farmers and retailers increasing accessibility and decreasing transport costs; (3) greater competition among importers and wholesalers driving down prices; and (4) high profitability of the horticulture industry leading to maize-horticulture intercropping systems (Denning et al., 2009 ). Understanding the major biophysical and environmental factors that drive agro-food systems is essential to improve crop quality and yield (HLPE, 2017 ). Developing effective soil fertility management practices is key to mitigate impacts on maize growth, yield, and nutritional value. Inadequate fertilization depletes the soil, resulting in nutrient-deficient crops planted in subsequent years if nutrients are not replenished through fertilization, organic residues, manure, and crop rotation or co-cropping with legumes (Sanchez, 2002 ; Manzeke et al., 2012 ). However, organic inputs, such as residue and manure, are largely recycling nutrients and will have limited benefit in an already nutrient-deficient area. This is particularly problematic with some nutrients because long-term cropping depletes them over time because the soil is continually mined of these elements. Nitrogen is a critical element for plant growth, production, and quality, and is the nutrient most often limiting plant growth. Nitrogen-based fertilizers maintain and typically increase crop yields (Vanlauwe et al., 2011 ), while lack of nitrogen reduces yield and protein content of harvested grain (Worku et al., 2006 ). Plants absorb nitrate and ammonium directly from the soil, which forms from mineralization of decomposing organic matter and is deposited from the atmosphere. Atmospheric nitrogen can also be converted to plant-available ammonium by nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Hirel et al., 2011 ). Low zinc and iron availability in soils reduces crop yield and grain content, impacting food security and human nutrition (HLPE, 2017 ). These minerals are often limited in populations dependent on staple cereal crops for their primary source of calories, and iron is often added to fortify milled flours. Organic and inorganic fertilizer can contribute to mineral uptake by crops, thereby improving zinc status in humans consuming the crops (Tessema et al., 2019 ). Even when total zinc and iron are sufficient in soils, plant availability, and subsequent transfer to humans, may be limited when soil pH is high. This presents an opportunity for agronomic, rather than genetic, methods to improve grain mineral content. In Zimbabwe, farmers struggle to adopt micronutrient fertilizers because most rely on organic fertilizer management practices, such as livestock manure, woodland litter, crop residues, and plot fallowing (Manzeke et al., 2012 ). These sources need to be evaluated for their efficacy as they may also be inherently low in micronutrients due to long-term soil depletion. High-quality organic materials improve a range of soil biological, chemical, and physical properties, including addition of nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus) and ability to solubilize minerals (e.g., zinc, iron, copper), resulting in improved maize yield and nutrient content for consumers (Masvaya et al., 2010 ). A fertility management study in Zimbabwe (Manzeke et al., 2012 ), improved the soil availability of zinc by applying organic and inorganic fertilizers, doubling yield and improving grain quality. Degraded soils benefit from alternative management practices. For example, the use of green manure crops (i.e., crops grown during typical fallow periods that are entirely incorporated into the soil to maintain cycling of soil nutrients and often addition of nitrogen) can contribute to the improvement and maintenance of soil fertility and nutrient content (Bertalot et al., 2013 ). While soil nutrient content decreases uptake and harvest in conventional crop management practices, the addition of biomass to the soil can minimize this trend. Decomposing leaves and branches release nutrients into the soil. For example, in bimodal rainfall areas of Africa, farmers established agroforestry systems using nitrogen-fixing leguminous tree fallows and leaves from nutrient-accumulating shrubs to improve the soil during the dry season before planting maize at the start of the rainy season (Sanchez, 2002 ).  5.3 Controlling pests and diseases The high costs of agricultural inputs may lead many farmers to inadequately control pests and diseases. To guarantee a successful and high-yielding maize growing season, efficient weed, disease, and insect controls are needed. Chemical methods are the most effective way to control weeds and pests. Healthy seeds or treating seeds with an insecticide provide early-stage protection against infectious diseases. Some farmers avoid diseases and pests by planting different resistant varieties. In many African countries, while large-scale commercial farmers rely on insecticides, only about 5 percent of smallholder farmers use them because they are often costly and not readily available. SDGs 3 and 6 encompass the need to reduce the consequences of excess fertilizer, herbicides, and pesticides and provide adequate measures to prevent water and soil pollution, which can lead to human illness and death (Table 1 ). Sustainable and responsible use of agrochemicals is important for human well-being, not only to increase production but to improve health outcomes in those who use them. Preserving the quantity and quality of our water resources globally includes responsible use (i.e., SDG14 and SDG15), and prevention of pollution from farm runoff. Furthermore, modern intensive maize production systems, including those that regularly employ chemical inputs, are dependent on fossil fuels, limiting their sustainability in the context of a changing climate (i.e., SDG7 and SDG13). New technologies can reduce ultimate dependency on fossil fuels, but will require appropriate agricultural extension services to realize gains in sustainability. Aflatoxin, a type of mycotoxin, is a serious health concern for humans who and livestock that consume maize. Aflatoxin is produced predominantly by Aspergillus flavus , which is a common fungus that infects maize when it is subjected to different stressors, such as drought, heat, or insect infestation. When consumed in large amounts, aflatoxin exposure causes aflatoxicosis, which can lead to liver cancer. Prevention of aflatoxin exposure and its related sequelae, which is directly related to SDG3, is an active area of research. High provitamin A carotenoid varieties of maize showed promise in the prevention of aflatoxin contamination when tested in five environments (Suwarno et al., 2019 ).   6 Non-food uses of maize Bonavia, 2013  and 2014, legislation in the U.S. drove a four-fold increase in domestic biofuel production. This strong demand for ethanol has incentivized efforts to produce more maize both in the U.S. and globally (Lewandrowski et al., 2019 ). The use of maize for biofuel has been somewhat controversial, in part due to large-scale production of ethanol on prime agricultural land that could be used for food production, as well as conflicting reports on the lifetime greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with biofuels (Hertel et al., 2010 ; Lewandrowski et al., 2019 ). The energy requirements of the world continue to increase while energy sources, such as fossil fuels, continue to decrease. However, ethanol production from crop residues is a renewable resource and GHG emissions from ethanol fuel are considered to be cleaner than those from other fuels (Ibeto et al., 2011 ). A comprehensive study by the USDA recently concluded that if current trends in biofuel production continue through 2022, corn ethanol production will result in a 44% reduction in life cycle GHG compared to gasoline. A high efficiency-high conservation scenario predicted potential reductions of up to 72%. These scenarios take into consideration how sustainably maize was grown, the distance between growers and biofuel production sites, and the processing techniques used in production (Lewandroski et al., 2019 ). In sub-Saharan Africa, an estimated 470 million people, around 47% of the population, do not currently have reliable access to electricity and clean water facilities (Sekoai and Yoro, 2016 ). However, six of the ten fastest growing global economies are in Africa and the population is expected to double over the next 30 years (Sekoai and Yoro, 2016 ). This massive growth, in addition to growing instability in oil prices as the demand outpaces supply could drive an expanding biofuels industry in this region (Sekoai and Yoro, 2016 ). Supporting and accelerating the development of a biofuels industry in this region would contribute to the goal of SDG8, decent work and economic growth. Bio-refining processes have improved greatly through the development of biofuel production. In line with SDG7, to ensure sustainable and modern energy, biofuel production from maize generates a variety of economically valuable coproducts. One of these coproducts is distillers’ dried grains with soluble mass, which can be used as a feed ingredient for livestock. Reducing food losses and waste manages the impact of these by-products on the environment and human health as articulated in SDG12. Common feedstocks for biofuels include nonedible crop residues such as maize stalks, purpose-grown bioenergy crops, or recycled organic materials and non-marketable wood. Research on biorefining processes focuses on biochemical and thermochemical conversion technologies for sustainable biofuels in addition to fermentation and gasification pathways (Whalen et al., 2017 ). While human consumption of maize has remained steady, the recent increases in global production and demand for maize is due to its use as livestock feed (Ranum et al., 2014 ). Both maize production and consumption are projected to expand for the next 10 years, driven largely by increased growth in food and feed demand and expanding livestock sectors in developing countries (OECD-FAO, 2018 ).  7 Conclusions Maize is one of the most important staple foods and sustainable approaches are needed to ensure its future role in fighting hunger, food insecurity, and improving nutrition. Examining the maize agro-food system demonstrates how such approaches can be linked with the SDGs. Efforts to achieve the SDGs by their goal year of 2030 must align with food system inputs. Investment is needed in agronomic and farming system research to improve food systems as a whole and stress nutritional aspects. Breeding strategies need to be complemented with the development of locally adapted, nutritious varieties of maize, while preserving the cultural heritage of this important crop throughout the world. Food systems affect culture, economy, livestock, and society (Willett et al., 2019 ). Designing adapted systems to improve the nutritional status of small-scale farmers includes increasing the use of improved varieties as well as the implementation of appropriate agronomic practices. Multidisciplinary approaches to work towards the goal of food secure, healthy people requires peaceful solutions and appropriate global partnerships for sustainable achievement of the SDGs and global health goals as outlined in SDGs 16 and 17, respectively.
