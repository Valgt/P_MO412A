               Cellular agriculture is a set of emerging technologies that allow the production of animal-derived foods without the traditional raising of livestock. Despite offering numerous potential benefits to humans, animals and the planet, the industry's impacts on sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations have not been fully assessed. Here, we evaluate how cellular agriculture might contribute to the SDGs by conducting a critical literature review. We frame our discussion by categorizing the SDGs into four broad topic areas (people, planet, prosperity, and protection of animals) and evaluate peer-reviewed literature showing cellular agriculture's vast potential to promote various social, economic, health, environmental, and animal welfare goals. Additionally, we highlight the significant technological, consumer acceptance, and policy gaps that still need to be addressed to realize this potential. We conclude the chapter by providing policy and research recommendations that can help maximize the industry's potential to support SDGs.

Keywords Animal welfare  Climate change  Environmental sustainability  Food security  Sustainable development goals   Chapter objectives • Outline the most relevant sustainable development goals (SDGs) to cellular agriculture.  • Evaluate how cellular agriculture can either promote or hinder progress toward the achievement of the SDGs under current conditions, as well as in future scenarios.  • Discuss the most critical future steps for cellular agriculture to be environmentally sustainable, nutritious, economical, and socially viable.     1 Introduction One of the biggest challenges facing humanity is how to feed a predicted population of nearly 10 billion by 2050 while reducing the impact of food production on the environment (Searchinger et al., 2019 ). To meet the demands of this growing population, it is estimated that food production will need to increase by 70% (FAO, 2009 ). While there are various sustainable ways of generating livestock products, many current systems are criticized as being damaging to the environment. Specifically, current methods of animal agriculture are often reported to use unsustainable amounts of limited natural resources and harm the environment by threatening biodiversity and releasing significant amounts of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) into the atmosphere (Dudley and Alexander, 2017 ; IPCC, 2022 ). Animal agriculture is often criticized for its high inefficiency; it is the second major contributor to human activity-based GHG emissions in addition to its consumption of approximately 30% of the Earth's useable land surface and 16% of global freshwater (Gerber et al., 2013 ; Foley et al., 2011 ; Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2010 ). The environmental impacts of animal agriculture are expected to worsen as the rise in the global economy and population accelerates the demand for animal products (Vranken et al., 2014 ). According to the United Nations (UN) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the consumption of meat and dairy products is expected to increase by 76% and 58%, respectively (Office of Assistant Director-General (Natural Resources Management and Environment Department), 2013 ). To meet the  growing demand for animal products without increasing the environmental impact of agricultural processes, there is an urgent need to develop sustainable alternative food production methods. Cellular agriculture is an emerging industry that uses advanced tools to derive animal products from cell cultures and precision fermentation rather than raising animals from birth to maturity (Mattick, 2018 ). Simply put, cellular agriculture uses the tissue engineering method that involves drawing a sample of animal stem cells and then culturing these cells in controlled environments with specialized growth media, where these cells can eventually be used to create products such as meat analogs (Post, 2012 ). Precision fermentation technologies utilize biologically engineered microorganisms such as yeast, bacteria, fungi, or algae, and these methods are better established due to their current commercial production of products such as medical insulin and chymosin for cheese making (Stephens et al., 2018 ). Despite proponents’ claims that cellular agriculture will become a major source of healthy animal proteins for humans with less environmental costs, there is still much uncertainty surrounding the industry. Therefore, this chapter aims to provide a preliminary review of cellular agriculture's potential by applying a framework drawn from the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs). The SDGs are a collection of 17 global goals and 169 targets agreed upon at the UN General Assembly in 2015. They represent a universal agenda to solve the world's most important social, economic, environmental, and development challenges by 2030 (United Nations, 2015 ). To better assess the interconnections between SDGs and to facilitate progress measurement, the 5 P's framework has been adopted to categorize the goals into People (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) that aim to improve the health, equality, and livelihoods of all, and also reducing poverty and hunger, Planet (SDGs 6, 12, 13, 14, and 15) that focus on environmental sustainability and protection of the planet, Prosperity (SDGs 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11) that strive to enhance economic prosperity globally, Peace (SDG 16) that promotes harmony across the global community, and Partnerships (SDG 17) that calls on all nations and individuals to work collectively to meet these goals (United Nations, 2015 ). However, due to the lack of relevance to the SDGs within Peace and Partnership, these categories were excluded from this assessment and replaced by a fourth category that we named “Protection of Animals” which focuses on improving animal welfare (Keeling et al., 2019 ) (Table 23.1  ). The remainder of this chapter will focus on the SDGs in the four broad topic areas (people, planet, prosperity, and protection of animals). In this chapter, we use a critical lens to explore the potential ways through which the cellular agriculture industry can advance the UN's SDGs. To achieve this, we present a review of the 17 SDGs and their 169 targets, industry status at the time of publication, and existing literature on cellular agriculture. We frame our discussion by adopting our 4 P modified version of the UN's 5 P's categorization. Through this framework, we explore the links between cellular agriculture and the SDGs by aiming to answer these questions: How can cellular agriculture advance the selected SDG in the current industry form and the future/ideal industry form? What synergies or trade-offs exist between SDG targets? Given the multitude of possibilities for cellular agriculture implementation strategies and governance models, much of this is still unknown. We conclude by providing recommendations that may allow cellular agriculture to maximize its potential to advance the SDGs.  2 Cellular agriculture and the sustainable development goals Table 23.1  displays the potential ways in which cellular agriculture may affect the SDGs using the UN's 5 P's categories lens with modifications for our 4 P version. From here on through the chapter we  use 4 P, with the understanding that it represents a modified version of the UN's 5 P lens. Columns of the table are separated into the impact on SDGs by cellular agriculture if currently available technologies were to be commercialized, as well as the projected impact if the industry and technologies  evolve in the optimal direction, thus based on hypothetical, “best-case scenario” situations. Potential trade-offs from the advancement of cellular agriculture were also evaluated. 2.1 Cellular agriculture and people The first SDG categorization is “People” and includes SDGs 1: No Poverty, 2: Zero Hunger, 3: Good Health and Well-Being, 4: Quality Education, and 5: Gender Equality (United Nations, 2015 ). Although cellular agriculture shows potential contributions to each, the most notable impact is found within its connections to various targets of SDGs 2 and 3. These SDGs aim to reduce the prevalence of global poverty and hunger and improve livelihoods, specifically focusing on the most vulnerable (United Nations, 2015 ). Improving food security is critical for the progression of both SDGs 2 and 3, as 45% of mortalities of children under five are nutrition-related (World Health Organization (WHO), 2020 ). Providing healthy, low-cost proteins is crucial for addressing long-term food security. As of 2020, an estimated 720–811 million individuals globally had endured hunger (FAO et al., 2021 ). Cellular agriculture can positively contribute to SDG 2 by reducing malnutrition as a sustainable, resilient, and nutritious food production method (Soice and Johnston, 2021 ). In the short term, however, cellular agriculture will likely be too expensive for most consumers, in addition to concerns surrounding consumer acceptance. Moreover, cellular agriculture can advance SDG 3 through the reduction of zoonotic diseases, foodborne illnesses, antibiotic resistance, as well as noncommunicable diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease associated with animal product consumption (Chriki and Hocquette, 2020 ). The potential for cellular agriculture to reduce global hunger is reflected in the FAO's four dimensions of food security: availability, access, utilization, and the all-encompassing stability of the food supply (Committee on World Food Security, 2012 ). Malnutrition, caused by the unavailability of food, can contribute to stunting and wasting, which impacted 22% and 6.7% of children under 5, respectively, in 2020 (Committee on World Food Security, 2012 ; FAO et al., 2021 ). Cellular agriculture can support food availability by contributing to the production of sufficient quantities of protein while using less time and resources, as finished products can be achieved in as short as several weeks (Sinke et al., 2023 ). Cellular agriculture must also be accessible to all, a notable limitation of current technologies which produce expensive proteins compared to those produced from conventional livestock (Soice and Johnston, 2021 ). While current cellular agriculture products (and alternative protein supplies, more generally) are expensive, over time the premium on the products is likely to drop as the technologies mature and go to scale. Meanwhile, livestock is likely to become more expensive due to climate change and carbon pricing, while continued research into the upscaling of cellular agriculture will likely result in reduced costs, potentially becoming the more affordable protein (Glaros et al., 2022 ). This progression to affordability is underway, as Mosa Meat has already been able to reduce the cost of their nutrient media to 1.5% of the original cost in less than 2 years (Mosa Meat, 2021 ). Animal-derived foods contribute to approximately 40% of global protein consumption and have considerable nutritional benefits, especially for populations lacking sufficient high-quality food sources (Parodi et al., 2018 ). Animal-derived products also provide critical micronutrients such as heme iron, vitamin B12, and calcium (Parodi et al., 2018 ). Preliminary analyses of a limited number of cultivated meat products indicated similar protein contents and quality to animal-derived meats, demonstrating protein contents of 18%–25%, with relatively high digestibility and good amino acid profiles (Sinke et al., 2023 ; Smetana et al., 2015 ). However, current data on micronutrient  compositions of cellular agriculture products highlights concerns of meeting sufficient concentrations, and if the micronutrients can be adequately utilized once consumed (Fraeye et al., 2020 ). Anemia, often caused by iron deficiencies, impacts approximately 30% of women globally in their child-bearing years and 60% of children under 5 in low- and middle-income countries (Development Initiatives, 2021 ). Inadequate micronutrient supplementation in cellular agriculture could further exacerbate the prevalence of anemia and, likewise, other nutritional deficiencies. Poor nutrition is the largest global driver for suboptimal health, resulting in 12 million deaths in 2018; however, the consumption of cellular-derived foods may potentially reduce this (Development Initiatives, 2021 ). Animal products often contain high levels of saturated fats and cholesterol, and carcinogenic compounds attributed to the cooking or preservation of meats, all of which negatively affect SDGs 2 and 3 by increasing noncommunicable disease incidence (Henchion et al., 2017 ). The health and well-being of the global population are also highly correlated to the safety of the food supply. The prevalence of foodborne illnesses is attributed to a variety of pathogens, often connected to conventional livestock cultivation (Chriki and Hocquette, 2020 ). More than 60% of transmissible illnesses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Ebola hemorrhagic fever are inked to animals (Karesh et al., 2012 ). Zoonotic diseases cause millions of deaths and almost 1 billion cases of illness each year, often disproportionally impacting lower-income countries (Karesh et al., 2012 ). Thus, a decreased dependence on livestock may reduce the incidences of these illnesses. The use of antibiotics is a major concern of livestock production, contributing to a considerable proportion of the total global usage (Mann et al., 2021 ). Over 1 million deaths were attributed to antibiotic resistance in 2019, and global deaths are estimated to reach 10 million annually by 2050, predominantly in developing countries (Murray et al., 2022 ; O'Neill, 2014 ). Cellular agriculture can potentially reduce the requirement for antibiotics as it employs highly controlled and monitored processes which limit the rate at which antibiotic-resistant species evolve, assuming processors refrain from utilizing antibiotics (Mann et al., 2021 ). As cellular agriculture evolves, these products could become more affordable, potentially reaching prices below those of animal products due to larger-scale production and fewer supply chain costs. At the time of writing, Eat Just food company is beginning the construction of 10 250,000-L bioreactors, creating a food foundry capable of producing over 13 million kilograms of meat a year (Good Meat, 2022 ). This is by far the largest scale operation currently being built, and if successful, it will likely pave the way to more (and even higher capacity) operations. Cellular agriculture could then become a stable and resilient food source due to a high capacity for monitoring food safety, reduction of food waste, and resistance to changing environmental conditions (Specht et al., 2018 ). To be able to feed large populations, research is currently needed to allow for commercial-scale production, improve process efficiency, and reduce overall costs. Advancements in nutrient media, energy sources, and other current expenses will aid in cost decreases to enable these foods to be more accessible. To prevent cellular agriculture from contributing to poor health and causing deficiencies, hindering progress toward the various targets of SDGs 2 and 3, research should be prioritized on finding suitable processing and fortification methods. Government regulations may also be utilized to ensure that products manufactured through cellular agriculture have similar micronutrient and protein compositions to animal-derived products. Moreover, the development of this disruptive technology is anticipated to bring a variety of economic impacts to the livelihoods of those working in the traditional agricultural sector, as discussed in further detail below.   2.2 Cellular agriculture and planet The Planet category of the SDG categorization includes SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation, 12: Responsible Consumption and Production, 13: Climate Action, 14: Life Below Water, and 15: Life on Land, which focus on reducing the negative impacts of human activities on the environment (United Nations, 2015 ). Currently, the environmental benefits of cellular agriculture are limited by high energy requirements and the prevalence of nonrenewable energy sources (Sinke et al., 2023 ). Previous literature has shown conflicting estimates of energy usage due to the industry's nascence and the resulting reliance on predictions and hypothetical models (Lynch and Pierrehumbert, 2019 ; Tuomisto and Teixeira de Mattos, 2011 ). One of the only life cycle analyses (LCA) available currently for cultivated meat was developed by Sinke et al. (2023)  using empirical data from various cellular agriculture companies and other organizations. This LCA predicted that the production of cultivated meat using conventional energy would have a greater global warming impact than chicken, pork, and dairy cattle (if produced with more sustainable methods estimated to be implemented by 2030) (Sinke et al., 2023 ). If, however, cellular agricultural facilities were powered using renewable energy (such as solar panels or biogas collected from municipal and livestock waste), then the energy footprint of cellular agriculture could be expected to drop further. Current livestock practices produce 14.5% of all human-caused emissions (Gerber et al., 2013 ). Increasing the scale of cellular agriculture production with current energy sources would only exacerbate the environmental implications of carbon dioxide emissions. Thus, a shift to more renewable sources is critical (Parodi et al., 2018 ). These carbon dioxide emissions contribute to ocean acidification and thus cellular agriculture could exacerbate this issue, as ocean acidity is already anticipated to drop approximately 0.4–0.5 pH units by the end of the 21st century (Godbold and Calosi, 2013 ). Ocean acidification and warming decrease biodiversity (SDG 14) by reducing survival and altering species' behavior (Godbold and Calosi, 2013 ; Lynch and Pierrehumbert, 2019 ). This impact has been observed previously; for example, in 2007, the west coast US shellfish industry recorded a direct relationship between the increase of carbon dioxide and mortality rates of larval Pacific oysters (Barton et al., 2015 ). Events such as this can disrupt entire industries as well as local employment, food security, and overall human well-being (SDGs 8,2,3) (Barton et al., 2015 ). The cultivation of agriculture requires the greatest demand for freshwater resources, and livestock production utilizes a significant proportion, with 98% of its consumption directed to produce feed (Hoekstra and Mekonnen, 2012 ). The water footprint for cultivated meat is estimated as 71 L per kg of product, while conventional livestock water requirements range from 46 to 253 L per kg of product, with beef cattle contributing the most and pork the least (Sinke et al., 2023 ). Cellular agriculture creates less water pollution than conventional livestock agriculture, which contributes to nutrient pollution from manure, heavy metals from livestock feed, and antibiotics (SDG 6) (Steinfeld et al., 2006 ). Additionally, nitrate leaching into drinking water can cause serious human health implications including the blood disorder methemoglobinemia in infants (Steinfeld et al., 2006 ). Pollution from land- and marine-based activities has shown negative impacts on SDGs 14, 15, commonly leading to the death, suffering, or reduced reproductive ability of species (Gregory, 2009 ). A transition to cellular agriculture could reduce eutrophication caused by nutrient loading, which negatively impacts species' survival due to decreased dissolved oxygen (Steinfeld et al., 2006 ).  Another significant concern is the physical pollution that comes from fishing gear, contributing approximately 10% of all debris polluting these environments, and has been recorded as impacting nearly half of all International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species (SDG 15) (FAO, 2020 ). The clearest potential benefit of cellular agriculture on SDG 14 is the reduction of overfishing by alleviating consumer demand for these foods. If fishing patterns continue to rapidly deplete stock densities, these aquatic ecosystems will be subject to various damaging changes, and there will be implications for human food sources (Link and Watson, 2019 ). Livestock utilizes 26% of the global ice-free land for grazing and 33% for feed cultivation and contributes to deforestation (Office of Assistant Director-General (Natural Resources Management and Environment Department), 2013 ). Anticipated land use for conventional livestock using more sustainable methods of production ranges from 5.5 to 24.3 m2 a crop equivalents/kg of product, while cultivated meat utilizes only 2.4 (Sinke et al., 2023 ). As a less land-intensive food system, cellular agriculture, coupled with the right policies, could allow for greater progression toward increasing reforestation, as well as a reduction in biodiversity loss and climate change (SDGs 13, 15) (Bhat et al., 2017 ; Godfray et al., 2010 ). Livestock production has also been tied to increased desertification, habitat fragmentation, droughts, and floods (Steinfeld et al., 2006 ). Unregulated hunting of wild meat causes changes in the food chain, impacting biodiversity and long-term food security, as well as reduced well-being from the increased prevalence of zoonotic diseases (Ripple et al., 2016 ). There is also a vast amount of waste to consider when evaluating conventional animal production, as unconsumed portions can contribute to over half of the total carcass weight (Ramachandraiah, 2021 ). Cultivated meat can reduce the amount of food lost to waste, thus promoting responsible consumption patterns that positively impact SDG 12. With that said, there are potential tradeoffs that policymakers must be cognizant of. Livestock production, especially extensive methods, can promote biodiversity through the protection of habitats, conservation of livestock breeds, nutrient supplementation for soil, and increased carbon-sequestering through encouraging grass growth (Godfray et al., 2018 ; Tuomisto, 2019 ). Policy instruments will be required to ensure any fallowed land is returned to ecosystem use rather than other more intensive uses. Cellular agriculture may allow a gradual drawdown of livestock and support the needs of a growing population, as current livestock practices cannot do so in a sustainable manner (Tuomisto, 2019 ). The clearest limitation of the current cellular agriculture industry is the immense amount of energy that these processes require, particularly in regions where energy is obtained from nonrenewable sources (Newman et al., 2022 ). This must be overcome to have a significant positive impact on the goals of the planet category, which include SDGs 8, 12, 13, 14, and 15. For the carbon footprint of cultivated meat to be less than that of traditional livestock, the industry will need to rely on a greater proportion of renewable energy sources (Sinke et al., 2023 ). The conversion to these more sustainable energy sources can reduce its carbon footprint by over 70%, from 14.3 to only 2.8–4.0 kg carbon dioxide equivalents/kg cultivated meat (Sinke et al., 2023 ). A proposition for utilizing biogas produced from livestock to operate cellular agriculture equipment has also been suggested, allowing for greater sustainability in both industries (Tuomisto, 2019 ). To test the link between cellular agriculture and its contribution to the SDGs of the “Planet” category, further research is required to transition to renewable energy sources, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Research is also essential for improving process efficiency and in the development of a more sustainable nutrient media. In addition, it would be beneficial to introduce policies that place the responsibility of wastewater treatment onto the food producers.   2.3 Cellular agriculture and prosperity According to the UN categorization of SDGs, the prosperity theme aims to “ensure that all human beings can enjoy prosperous and fulfilling lives and that economic, social and technological progress occurs in harmony with nature.” (United Nations, 2015 ). The SDGs encompassed by this theme include those which ensure affordable and clean energy; decent work and economic growth; industry, innovation, and infrastructure; reduced inequalities; and sustainable cities and communities, that is, SDGs 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, respectively (United Nations, 2015 ). As an emerging and highly promising industry, cellular agriculture has been advancing at a rapid pace in terms of technological and economic scale (Brennan et al., 2021 ). This suggests that the industry may have major and potentially complex impacts on SDGs related to social, economic, and technological innovations, specifically, SDGs 8, 9, 10, and 11. The cellular agriculture industry presents a unique opportunity to diversify the global food production industry, which also coincides with a currently potent movement to shift to analogs of conventional animal products. There are currently no peer-reviewed publications on the economic trends and prospects of emerging technologies in the protein industry. However, the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) has reported that alternative protein sources will account for 11%–22% of the human dietary protein worldwide by 2035 (Morach et al., 2021 ). The alternative protein industry is predicted to reach up to US$ 290 billion by 2030, and cellular agriculture-derived products are expected to contribute to this market (Morach et al., 2021 ). For example, the McKinsey and Company consulting group estimates that the market for cultivated meat to reach US$ 25 billion in annual sales by 2030 (Brennan et al., 2021 ). Under these conditions, cellular agriculture will facilitate the achievement of SDGs 8 and 9 by creating new forms of employment and opportunities to launch small to medium-sized enterprises to support economies (see Chapter 31 ). Additionally, the vital requirement for scientific and technical skills provides the opportunity to enhance research and innovation, which could lead to an influx of government funding in addition to the predominately private investments. Another way in which cellular agriculture contributes to the prosperity category is through SDG 11. According to the UN, this goal aims to “make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable” (United Nations, 2015 ). Cellular agriculture can support targets in this SDG in three main ways. First, the industry can reduce the land and water (synergistic with SDGs 6 and 15) that are used by the conventional livestock industry that, if paired with policy to protect land and encourage ecosystem restoration, can lead to improved and expanded green spaces and biodiversity, especially in rural communities. Secondly, the industry can alleviate air and water contamination risks, which can improve the quality of life in communities surrounding intensive livestock farming (synergistic with SDGs 3, 6, and 13). Lastly, considering the controlled environment setting of cellular agriculture, producing food in urban centers can support sustainability and resiliency of urban communities by reducing food miles, as well as increasing resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related disasters (synergistic with SDG 13). Although cellular agriculture undoubtedly presents many opportunities to advance the prosperity goals discussed, potential trade-offs exist with other SDGs. There are questions surrounding how the industry would affect employment opportunities and inequalities worldwide. On the one hand, countries in the global north may be able to create jobs and new sources of income resulting from the economic opportunities provided by the emerging industry. In these regions, job opportunities are expected to increase in cellular agriculture-related professions such as chemical, biotechnological, and  pharmaceutical industries. However, this may lead to job losses in traditional agriculture—further exacerbating inequalities due to the demand for a more skilled labor force. On the other hand, the expansion of cellular agriculture markets poses enormous threats to the livelihoods of individuals, communities, and countries that depend on livestock agriculture, and introduces questions of uneven labor dynamics within urban areas. The FAO, 2018  reports that livestock agriculture contributes at least 40% of the total agricultural output in developed and 20% in developing countries (FAO, 2018 ). In addition to providing nutrition, over a billion people are engaged in animal farming, while the seafood industry employs approximately 60 million people globally, of which most are small-scale producers, harvesters, and farmers (FAO, 2020 , 2018 ). Furthermore, the United Nations' “International Fund for Agricultural Development” 2020 report on the livestock sector supports the use of animal agriculture among small-scale farmers to advance SDGs (Rota and Urbani, 2021 ). Although even the fastest case scenarios of cellular agriculture development are slow enough to result in a many-year transition period, it is imperative that governments design careful policies to protect and support the many people across the globe who would inevitably be impacted by the transition given the critical role of conventional livestock agriculture. The conditions described above can cause cellular agriculture to undermine the achievement of SDG 10 which aims to “reduce inequalities within and among countries” (United Nations, 2015 ) by widening the technological gap between the global north and global south nations. There is also a concern for increasing monopoly on global agriculture by multinational corporations that may eventually purchase and conglomerate the many start-up companies that currently dominate the cellular agriculture space. To mitigate these outcomes, strong policies from governments will be required to support the existence of many small enterprises and to regulate markets for products from both cellular and conventional agriculture industries.  2.4 Cellular agriculture and the protection of animals The “Protection of Animals” category is used in reference to the welfare of domesticated and wild animals. This topic has become increasingly important in recent years, with many scholars highlighting the ethical treatment of animals as an important global goal that plays a central role in achieving several existing SDGs (Keeling et al., 2019 ; Olmos Antillón et al., 2021 ). The SDGs center on humans and human well-being. To the extent that concerns relating to environmental protection and preservation are included, they are placed in service to human welfare and the needs of future human generations. Nonhuman animals never enter the SDGs as lives that matter in their own right, with their needs thereby positioned as instruments for human prosperity and the sustainable development of human societies. The 2030 agenda acknowledges animal welfare, yet only because it is deemed important for the health and sustainability of global ecosystems that are key to achieving human welfare (Broom, 2019 ; Folke et al., 2016 ). While the SDGs aim to preserve human life and support human health, the only discussion of animal welfare is in service to this end. Ensuring animal welfare would challenge a system in which they are raised and slaughtered for food and other products. However, the 2030 agenda only points to reductions in the number of animals raised for these purposes to support several SDGs that have been previously noted such as: reduced risk of zoonotic diseases (SDG 3), clean and water and sanitation by reducing water used on animal farms (SDG 6), improvement of communities  and the environment through reduced animal waste and GHG emissions (SDGs 11 and 13), and reducing land used for rearing animals and growing feed (SDG 15). The recognition of the interconnections between animal agriculture and human health has fostered the tentative inclusion of animal welfare in global discussions. As such, the UN Committee's report on World Food Security and Nutrition identified improving animal welfare as a goal for achieving sustainable agricultural development and contributing to current and future food security and nutrition (The High Level Panel of Experts on Food Security and Nutrition, 2016 ). Despite not appearing in the SDGs, animal welfare is included as an explicit component of the definitive article on “sustainable intensification” (Garnett et al., 2013 ) that presents a framework for balancing human and ecological needs within farming systems. The case for protection of animals is perhaps more relevant to this chapter because of the cellular agriculture industry's claim of producing “cruelty-free” animal products. This is because the current cellular agriculture technologies can make products with only a small sample of animal tissue or none (Post, 2012 ; Stephens et al., 2018 ). This suggests that these methods can significantly reduce the number of livestock raised for food commodities and consequently reduce the rate of animal slaughter. Although animal welfare is still subordinated to human interests in most discussions, these arguments posit that the use of cellular agriculture would reduce animal suffering in livestock farming by allowing the opportunity to create better living conditions, improved nutrition, and improved health care for the animals. Furthermore, technologies used in cellular agriculture can help to protect wildlife and alleviate extinction threats. By providing relatively safer means to produce exotic animal products (Bhat and Fayaz, 2011 ), the industry can help lower the number of wild animals hunted for their products. For instance, a Sydney-based food tech company, VOW, specializes in the production of kangaroo, zebra, and tortoise meats through cellular agriculture techniques (de Lorenzo, 2021 ). Despite high optimism to solve animal protection and health challenges, the cellular agriculture industry faces some major obstacles. One of the biggest obstacles relates to cell culture media, which provides nutrients for cells to grow (see Chapter 12 ). Today, most cell culture media include components harvested from animals, which cause ethical concerns, in addition to being very costly. Several companies and scientific labs have been working on developing animal-free and affordable culture media (Selby, 2020 ). Additionally, some researchers argue cellular agriculture's potential to exacerbate the extinction of traditional livestock breeds (Helliwell and Burton, 2021 ). A solution to the ethical and scalability concerns of cellular agriculture will raise the industry's potential to advance goals associated with the protection of domestic and wild animals.   3 Conclusion Transformations in global agriculture are urgently needed to create sustainable food systems capable of feeding the growing global population within planetary boundaries and with limited resources. Cellular agriculture claims to present a unique opportunity that not only addresses environmental and sustainability concerns, but also public health and ethical aspects of food production. As we have previously reviewed complex interconnections between cellular agriculture and the UN's SDGs, we propose three recommendations to help this industry maximize its potential to advance these SDGs. First, there is a need for a robust research and development framework that addresses technical obstacles that still exist within cellular agriculture. The industry would benefit from independent  empirical LCAs that demonstrate its capacity to address sustainability and environmental issues, including the resulting environmental pollution and the efficiency of resource usage, such as land, energy, and water. Given the animal welfare promise from the industry, there is a need to develop affordable and animal-free growth media to solve both ethical and scalability concerns. Furthermore, the industry will need to deliver products that meet health, nutritional, and sensory expectations to achieve consumer acceptance and regulatory standards. Regulations will be determined by individual countries. The second recommendation calls for comprehensive assessments of the social and economic implications of cellular agriculture's launch onto the market. Cellular agriculture's success will certainly bring many economic opportunities; however, the new industry will also create an uneven playing field for small-scale livestock farmers by favoring large-scale enterprises, which can dominate markets by aggressively investing in the new costly technologies. Therefore, it is critical to closely examine the social and economic impacts caused by the industry, and for governments to implement policies and regulations that protect those that would be most affected. Cellular agriculture's potential to advance SDGs can only be realized if it does not undermine the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of individuals, families, and communities that depend on conventional livestock agriculture globally. Lastly, we recommend building knowledge dissemination programs specifically for cellular agriculture. Given the industry's nascency, it is important to create formal academic programs that equip the next generation with skillsets to solve technical challenges, as well as critical knowledge to dissect the industry's potential for society. Equally important is the need to disseminate knowledge widely to the public to increase awareness about the novel industry's potential benefits and impacts. New technologies, especially in food production, can be challenged by public acceptance as evidenced by a poor acceptance of the introduction of genetically modified crops. Knowledge mobilization would provide an opportunity for transparency and trust building with the public, which can gain increased acceptance of cellular agriculture products upon launch. Humanity is facing an urgent call to feed an increasing population without further harming the planet. Cellular agriculture is not a panacea, as no technology ever is; however, with further research and careful policy development, it has the potential to overcome critical environmental and sustainability problems associated with global food production.
