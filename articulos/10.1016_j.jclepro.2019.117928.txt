                  Member nations that signed up to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals agenda designated a coordinator to promote meaningful participation of the ministries. This study applies the concepts from responsive regulation to policy coordination. The framework provides four types of responsiveness, supporting the analysis of 53 interviews in Finland, Germany and Czech Republic. It was found that they were minimalists at heart, and therefore would do just enough (pyramidal), care from a distance (meta), and influence through the peers (networked). They would control matters that are more procedural and temporary (e.g. inter-ministerial working groups) and not those more substantive and permanent (e.g. setting of performance targets). Moreover, the centre of government rather than the individual ministries is most suitable for responsive coordination due to its perceived neutrality. The whole-of-government strategy on sustainable development is the result of artful coordination that is responsive and neutral. Future research might explore when would responsiveness and neutrality in coordination cease to be beneficial.

Graphical abstract Image 1       Keywords Coordination  Integration  Sustainable development  Responsive regulation    1 Introduction As a triumph of coordination, 193 member nations pledged to implement the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Agenda. This flexible agenda upholds the principle of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities’, allowing governments to determine responses appropriate for their countries. They could rely on the existing bureaucratic capacity to self-organise without a delegated coordinator. Alternatively, they can assign a ministry or agency as the coordinator for aggregating ministerial inputs systematically into policy deliverables. In the United Kingdom (UK) and Australia, the Parliament held inquiries into SDGs implementation, expecting thoughtful coordination (Parliament of Australia, 2018 ; UK Environmental Audit Committee, 2017 ; UK International Development Committee, 2016 ). Implicit in this expectation is that, without a coordinator, self-organisation among ministries for proper implementation would not take place. Looking across Europe, many governments have long established institutions for inter-ministerial integration to produce policy output (e.g., National Strategy on Sustainable Development), policy process (e.g., inter-ministerial forums), and monitoring system (e.g., Sustainability Impact Assessment). These achievements, however incremental (Nordbeck and Steurer, 2016 ), are not a result of self-organised networks. These institutions appoint a coordinator that has to be responsive to the ministries’ resistance to coordination because (1) the bureaucracy supports ministerial autonomy, and (2) the SDGs Agenda is a soft measure. Firstly, the coordinator is typically legitimized to regulate the coordinated ministries who can choose to either comply with or resist the regulation. Resistance from the ministries is common and understandable, given the level of ministerial autonomy in national governments (Fleischer, 2011 ). To overcome resistance, the coordinator can impose the SDGs onto the ministries but doing so requires significant political capital from the coordinator (Peters, 2013 ). Therefore, as the authority, it has to learn how to respond to ministerial resistance–proportionately. The coordination strategies can vary from mandating the inclusion of sustainability commitments in the ministerial plans (Government Administration Unit of Finland, 2017 ) to inviting scientific inputs into the inter-ministerial deliberation of sustainability targets (The Federal Government of Germany, 2017 ). These coordination strategies were clearly stated as isolated and static processes in policy documents but not as a dynamic set of strategies that represented the coordinator's responsiveness towards ministerial resistance. Secondly, the SDGs agenda may be globally significant, but it is possibly the softest of all global governance tools (Tosun and Leininger, 2017 ). It can use norm-setting opportunities such as progress reporting in the Voluntary National Review to compel ministries to participate in the implementation of SDGs. However, the ministries would merely report on the alignment of their existing work with the SDGs without making more ambitious commitments (Persson et al., 2016 ). The absence of strong enforcement internationally and domestically weakens the coordinator's legitimacy, forcing it to engage with the ministries responsively . The Voluntary National Reviews indicate the coordination capability of the countries in terms of coordination outcomes (e.g., establishment of inter-ministerial structure and agreement on cross-ministerial joint priorities). However, little is known about the dynamic and responsive processes of coordination required to maximize the participation of ministries in the soft SDGs Agenda. Constrained by ministerial autonomy and soft Agenda, this article asks what makes a coordinator responsive to ministerial resistance?  This study aims to understand coordinating agencies in integration regimes of Germany, Finland and the Czech Republic. It combines insights from the policy coordination literature (Peters, 2013 ) and the responsive regulation theory (Braithwaite, 2017 ). This lens of responsive coordination is applied to the analysis of the coordinator's behaviours. Through coordination, ministries have closer interactions with each other, provoking clashes of interests. The coordinator needs to ensure the integration regime weathers the storm and emerges at the other end with some level of cohesiveness. The data in this study suggests different types of responsiveness for managing different coordination challenges, including doing just enough (pyramidal), caring from a distance (meta), and influencing through peers (networked). Being responsive does not always mean taking actions or sides; it may mean maintaining neutrality as the coordinator, which makes the centre of government the most suitable candidate.  2 Literature gap This section aims to identify the literature gap of non-dynamic understanding of policy coordinators and hence present a framework that describes responsive coordination. It combines insights on the essential tasks of policy coordination  and those on the dynamic strategies of responsive regulation . The literature on policy coordination attempted to clarify the relationship between the coordinator and the coordinated within systems of different centralization level. By definition, ‘coordinated decisions’ may ‘avoid, reduce, counterbalance, and outweigh’ the negative consequences of one decision on another (Lindblom, 1965 ). Structurally, decentralized coordination functions better (Scharpf, 1993 ) because the coordinators are spared from spending heavy political capital to impose solutions that can be developed through information exchange and position bargaining between ministries (Peters, 2013 ). However, if the ‘locus of coordination’ is unidentifiable (i.e. decentralized coordination), these activities may translate into government departments paying lip service to their commitments (Russel and Jordan, 2009 ). Moreover, a coordinator can activate the inter-ministerial collaboration (Peters, 2013 ), facilitate inter-ministerial processes (Tosun and Peters, 2018 ), convene collaborative meetings (Gjoksi et al., 2010 ), aggregate ministerial inputs, catalyses institutional reform (Ansell and Gash, 2018 ), and set and follow-up whole-of-government indicators (O et al., 2016 ). So far, the coordination system is described as dichotomous (centralized or decentralized) rather than continuous (levels of centralization). In practice, coordinators are likely to be responsive in selecting from a range of strategies based on the ministries' reactions. The following three points help justify the relevance of responsive coordination. Firstly, institutional designers ought to ask ‘who is more responsive as a coordinator’. In coordinating environmental policy integration, the Ministry of Environment may not be as good a candidate as the more traditionally powerful agencies such as the Prime Minister's Office and Ministry of Finance that can secure unquestionable political commitment (Nilsson and Persson, 2017 ). Moreover, the coordinator role is best ‘owned’ by one agency and not shared across multiple departments (Russel and Jordan, 2009 ). It can be speculated that a single powerful coordinator may have more leeway to influence, which has not been investigated in depth. Secondly, an innovative study has attempted to measure how centralized the coordination system is for implementing SDGs with a simple indicator on the countries' level of democracy (Tosun and Peters, 2018 ). No clear pattern was detected, which may suggest that this type of categorization is too crude for a subject as dynamic as coordination. A more refined categorization would account for the way coordinators select strategies for coordinating ministries. Thirdly, the Metcalfe Scale lays out a continuum of coordination (Metcalfe, 1994 ), from the minimal state of preventing overlaps in functions to the maximal state of complete control over all information flow and planned activities (Peters, 1998 ). It is a model more dynamic than the previous two; however, coordination is described more as an end state, rather than a process of movements between different levels of coordination. In short, this article deals with two inter-related gaps in the literature. To date, scholars have not addressed the question of whether the centre of government is the best coordinator for implementing SDGs. More crucially, this coordinator should be flexible enough to respond appropriately to different coordination situations. The literature does not describe how coordination can be responsive. It is necessary to clarify that this article does not intend to suggest new theoretical constructs for responsive coordination. Staying as close to the data as possible, the analysis borrows existing concepts in responsive regulation to describe the observations of policy coordination behind the glossy public documents in ways more systematic than the existing studies.  3 Conceptual framework Theoretically, this article applies concepts from responsive regulation to policy coordination challenges. There are three main types of responsiveness. The first type is the pyramidal responsiveness approach, which provides coordinators access to a suite of coordination strategies. The coordinators can choose as appropriate. Fig. 1   demonstrates a modified version that adopts (a) the structure of the regulatory pyramid, and (b) the content of the Metcalfe Scale. Structurally, the different levels of coordination strategies fit well into the pyramidal responsiveness framework. From the perspective of the ministries, the coordinators will start with persuasion and capacity building before reaching for more interventionist approaches (Braithwaite, 2017 ). Each level up is a level more interventionist, imposing greater threats to ministerial autonomy. Ministries would prefer, as minimal as possible, the coordinator's interference in their portfolios. The coordinator responds by selecting strategies from the lower end of the scale. An effective coordination system will be consistent at responding to ministerial resistance to the extent that ministries will be ‘educated’ over time to expect escalation if non-compliant and de-escalation if compliant. When the feedback mechanisms are clear, ministries will perceive the coordination system as less coercive, less threatening, more respectful (Pettit, 1997 ) and fairer (Murphy, 2016 ). Clear feedback mechanisms may lower perceived threat and anxiety. The Metcalfe Scale lays out a suite of strategies, ranging from minimal coordination that has little control over interactions between coordinated agents (i.e. government ministries) to maximum coordination that instructs agents to move coherently under common priorities and strategy. The second type is networked responsiveness, which follows the basic principles of pyramidal responsiveness. However, when interventions at one level fail, the coordinator would seek support from networks within that level before escalating to a higher level of interventions. Beyond the vertical escalation and de-escalation on the pyramid, this horizontal move of networked responsiveness is strategic in recruiting additional actors more powerful than the coordinator for the specific coordination issue at hand in order to persuade the ministries to comply (Braithwaite and Drahos, 2000 ). It is not until all options from the networks are exhausted that the coordinator will shift to the next level of interventions (Braithwaite, 2008 ). The primary motive of the coordinator is no longer to control the activities of the ministries but to build their capacity in inter-ministerial coordination (Braithwaite, 2017 ). Pyramidal responsiveness relies a fair amount on the control from the coordinator despite the overarching principle being minimalism. Networked responsiveness is even more minimalist by encouraging more creative problem-solving among actors in the network before escalating the coordinator's response. The third type is meta-regulatory responsiveness, in which the coordinator governs at a distance, allowing ministries to find ways to ‘critically self-reflect’ (Parker, 2002 ) on their inter-ministerial coordination. The encouragement of self-reflection can include standard-setting and timely feedback from the coordinators. The coordinators have devolved inter-ministerial coordination responsibilities to the ministries who may know best about their respective policy portfolios and the range of possibilities for inter-ministerial integration. With trust, commitment and loyalty towards the cause of inter-ministerial integration (Gunningham and Sinclair, 2009 ), enlightened ministries may hopefully move towards greater integration without constant intervention from the coordinator. However, such a decentralized system may be more effective if coordinators are capable of escalating to highly coercive coordination but rarely get to do so. In effect, the coordinators are perceived by the ministries to ‘walk softly and carry a big stick’. The dilemma is whether the coordinator can restrain itself from using the stick (Braithwaite, 2014 ). The analysis framework combines useful concepts from two bodies of literature. Firstly, the three types of responsiveness (i.e., pyramidal, networked and meta) can be matched with different kinds of coordination challenges. Secondly, pyramidal responsiveness (Braithwaite, 2017 ) when combined with the Metcalfe Scale (Metcalfe, 1994 ) can offer details on the levels of coordination. The Scale replaces the list of punitive strategies in the original regulatory pyramid to form the basis for the concept of pyramidal responsiveness to be used in this study.  4 Methodology Coordinators work closely with ministries to develop a whole-of-government strategy on sustainability. To probe the messy world of strategy development and the tug-of-war between the coordinator and the ministries, it is necessary to capture the personal experiences of public servants behind the façade of the policy documents. Their motivations and less tangible factors are best studied through qualitative studies (Rosati and Faria, 2019 ). The methodological design attempts to strike a balance between sufficient consistency  to demonstrate dominant patterns across the three countries being considered and sufficient diversity  to assess the validity of dominant patterns of SDGs implementation at the national level (Mahoney and Goertz, 2004 ). Based on the assessment of Voluntary National Reviews, two early adopters of the SDGs agenda demonstrated a strong ability in articulating relevant administrative structures with clearly defined functions (i.e., Germany and Finland). During the fieldwork, the interviewees recommended the Czech Republic as an emerging leader that has received significant resources from the European Union dedicated to SDGs implementation. A total of 53 interviewees participated in the study, including public servants, academics and civil society leaders (see Table 1  ). The public servants provided the richest data, which were then triangulated against the experiences of other actors to improve the trustworthiness of the analysis. The single-letter codes displayed in Table 1  are strung together to form unique identifiers for individual interviewees. For example, ‘G17B’ means that the interviewee is the 17th participant in the study, from Germany (G), and worked as a bureaucrat in the public service (B). The semi-structured interviews focussed on two aspects of the coordination: which agency or ministry is an effective coordinator, and how can coordinators gain cooperation from ministries. The interviews tested the scenario of a coordinator that is given more resources and legitimacy to implement the SDGs. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. In addition, the author also collected publicly available reports and interviewee-supplied documents, which include policy strategy, evaluation report, terms of reference for the committee, internal assessment template, and presentation slides. The Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) Framework acknowledges the institutional diversity and various rules that actors create to maintain consistency in how people relate with each other (Ostrom, 2005 ). It can be used to systematically diagnose problems of ‘collective action’ among resource-dependent actors, which includes policy coordination among public servants (Peters, 2013 ). Firstly, the author used key elements of the IAD to understand the institutional context, which involved mapping of the actors, forums and group characteristics based on the publicly available documents mentioned above. Secondly, the author structured the data in compliance with the standard ADICO syntax detailed in a study on collective action for natural resource management (Watkins and Westphal, 2016 ). It codified ‘who (Attribute) does (Deontic) what (aIm) to whom under what situations (Condition) for what consequences (Or else)’ as individual rules. From approximately 53 h ours of interviews, 1135 rules were identified via the ADICO syntax, coded against the responsive coordination framework, and aggregated to form themes on avoidance behaviours. A comparative case study of coordinating institutions has been difficult because commonly agreed process and outcome indicators for policy integration are yet to be developed (Peters, 2015 ). Instead, the analysis focuses on identifying themes shared across Finland, Germany and the Czech Republic.  5 Findings The findings are presented in two ways: the consensus and the experiences of interviewees. Firstly, an overview of the data in Table 2   will be provided by showing the extent to which interviewees across the three countries agree or disagree with four ways that the coordinator responds to the coordination situations. Across countries, the first and fourth types of responsiveness received a high level of consensus, whereas the second and third types were not as widely agreed upon among the interviewees. The lack of consensus is not due to disagreements but a sizeable group of interviewees describing at length the first and fourth types of responsiveness and not the other two. Furthermore, the temporary types that relate more to the development of National Strategy are more commonly mentioned than the permanent types that involve a longer period of observations by the interviewees. When comparing across the countries, the Finns appear to have greater consensus around how their coordinator behaves than the Germans and the Czechs. Bearing these in mind, the next section will introduce the types of responsive coordination as the interviewees experienced them. Notably, the following presentation is not unusual in the literature on policy coordination (Hustedt and Salomonsen, 2017 ; Russel et al., 2018 ). 5.1 Responsive coordination The second part of the findings presents the pattern of coordination experiences. Coordinators selected the appropriate strategies according to whether the coordination challenge was temporary or permanent, and whether it was procedural or substantive. The author has grouped the challenges into four types based on these two dimensions. For each type of challenge, the author will explain the coordinator's motivation, the coordinator's response, and the range of strategies – as summarized in Table 3  . Coordinators were frequently constrained by ‘strong and autonomous’ ministries (G14B) that would resist any form of ‘coordination’ and ‘centralisation’ (G57B). Therefore, responsive coordination was needed.  5.2 Temporary procedural integration The coordinator designed temporary procedures to influence the processes of information sharing and strategic bargaining between ministries. These procedures started on the first day of developing the National Strategy and Sustainability Guideline and ended once the policy outputs are produced. The coordinator supported these procedures by preparing policy materials, structuring discussions around indicators (C44B), drafting the joint documents (F24B), setting tangible milestones, and enforcing strict timelines (G13B, G21B) in order to encourage greater participation of individual ministries. Proportionate to the ministerial resistance, the coordinator adopted the pyramidal responsiveness  approach. The coordinator started with the least interventionist strategies and escalated up the pyramid of intervention (see Fig. 1 ) only if the ministerial resistance had increased. The first example is that the coordinator gave ministries complete autonomy for drafting sections of the National Strategy on portfolios nominated by the ministries themselves. If the ministries resisted, the coordinator would draft their sections in unrealistically ambitious terms, forcing the ministries to at least respond to the first draft (G57B). After much reframing of the early drafts, the coordinator would then facilitate more ‘brutal’ and ‘realistic’ deliberation to produce an implementable Strategy (G5C). The escalation up to much more coercive interventions were thought to be necessary by some (G18B) and unwarranted by others, who preferred a longer and more diplomatic deliberation to ministerial commitments (G9B, G10B). The second example is on enforcing the new rules for how indicators and goals should be used – specifically on clustering multiple indicators and goals rather than focusing on them individually (C44B, F29B) or ensuring all ministries nominated at least one indicator for each of the 17 goals (G8B). When a couple of ministries had difficulty reaching consensus on new targets within their ministries, the coordinator would set deadlines (G14B), of which if not met, the coordinator would ‘come down hard’ on non-compliant ministries (G9B). As frustrated as the ministries were with the near impossibility of moving fast to achieve ambitious consensus in a fragmented system, they tolerably complied with and did not ‘rubbish’ (G57B) the temporary processes implemented by the coordinator (G9B, G10B, G13B).  5.3 Permanent procedural integration The coordinator needed to create procedures that will continue beyond the production of the National Strategy, which were more permanent, and therefore the coordinator has less control over. These new routines can include legislative instrument (e.g., sustainability impact assessment) (G20B), capacity building (e.g., sustainability coordinator) (G21B), and bureaucratic reporting (e.g., inclusion of sustainability activities in ministerial plans) (U52B). This challenge required the central coordinator to strike a consensus on recurring integration procedures; it was difficult to achieve because these permanent measures imposed a drain on bureaucratic resources, especially when ministerial representatives are already ‘running from one meeting to another’ (F32B). Accordingly, the coordinator adopted a pyramidal de-escalation  approach that starts with the coordinator proposing an idea on permanent procedure in search of agreements from all the ministries. From here onwards, it could enter into one of the three scenarios depending on ministerial resistance. First, if the resistance were manageable, the coordinator would compromise on their ideas. For example, the Chancellery proposed the permanent procedure that required ministries to appoint a senior level official as the Sustainability Coordinator. Met with resistance from the ministries, the Chancellery settled with officials from a lower-level rank, which was seen as a ‘big mistake [of the coordinator] for allowing such flexibility’ for the ministries (G2B). The second scenario shows that de-escalation was not required if the ministerial resistance was low. For example, the coordinator assigned a ministry to design platforms for bringing science into the deliberation of sustainable development (G9B). The coordinator proposed the idea, expecting a de-escalation of coordination strategies. However, the ministries accepted the proposal, which was then included in the national strategy as a permanent procedure. For the third scenario, some permanent procedures such as the reform of the long-standing issue about Sustainability Impact Assessment was brought up but remained untouched throughout the process of developing the National Strategy. Similarly, the inclusion of sustainability principles in the Basic Law (i.e. constitution) has been thoroughly debated. However, before this proposal could gain momentum, the Ministry of Interior threatened that they would not participate in the Chancellery's process should this issue be placed on the agenda (G11B). The significant ministerial resistance on changes to the Impact Assessment and Basic Law informed the coordinator that it was best to leave them to the next wave of reform (G57B). The coordinator was only permitted to ‘make their case to convince’ individual ministries to adopt permanent procedural integration. It could never make decisions for the ministries (G2B). Ministries resisted against the coordinator, especially if they ‘believed that their positions have the backing of the general public’ (G10B). The coordinator spent the majority of their time searching for agreements among the ministries (see Fig. 1 ). Hence, few permanent procedures made it into the Strategy eventually.  5.4 Permanent substantive integration The challenge of integration was even steeper for deliberating over substantive matters. The ministerial actors participated in the temporary procedural integration  to produce the National Strategy that implemented the permanent procedural integration  (i.e., routine processes for ministerial participation) for building capacity for substantive integration  (i.e., joint policy commitments to be developed by ministries later on) (G56B, F28B, C46B). The role of the coordinator in permanent substantive integration was ‘highly contentious’ (G2B). Therefore, it was safest for the coordinator to ‘keep a distance’ and took a meta-responsive  approach in four ways. Firstly, the coordinator should not ‘define [policy] goals through top down mechanisms’ given that ministerial autonomy was strong and coordination capacity was insufficient (G18B). It would assume the leadership of procedural integration and leave the leadership of substantive integration to the ministries (G21B). When prompted to integrate policy substance, the ministries nominated topics and indicators that fell naturally into their portfolios without dictation from the coordinator (G13B). If there were unresolved conflicts around substantive integration, the ministries might escalate the issues up to the Heads of Department (G8B) and approach the coordinator to mediate the unresolved inter-ministerial conflicts (G14B, G57B); the coordinator was passive. Secondly, the coordinator might proactively ‘identify bottlenecks’ for inter-ministerial negotiation (G14B). In the presence of the coordinator, the ministries would be ‘on their best behaviours’ when resolving interministerial conflicts. The ministries might even ‘drop the arguments’ before the mediation occurred knowing that the coordinator was involved (G56B). Thirdly, the coordinator intervened from a distance. At the inter-ministerial committees involving the highest rank officials, the coordinator followed the convention of allowing the ‘state secretaries of ministries dominate over the discussion’ (G12C). And the most that the coordinator can do was becoming the ‘observer’ and ‘facilitator’ (G15A) of negotiation around ‘cross-ministerial issues such as circular economy, land use planning and energy efficiency’ (C42B). More specifically, it meta-regulated and guided the negotiation as an authority for upholding the sustainability principles or ‘Management Rules’ or ‘Strategy Priorities’ (The Federal Government of Germany, 2017 ). Non-compliance from the ministries would be questioned but not severely penalized (G8B). Fourthly, the coordinator set the pace. It balanced interests across ministries by ‘pulling [champion ministries] back from moving too fast’, ‘standing on the middle ground between transformation and conservatism’ (G14B), and ‘ensuring all parties were slightly unsatisfied about the final joint agreement’ (F41B).  5.5 Temporary substantive integration This challenge may not be particularly common. Most of the time, substantive integration is permanent. However, the central coordinator could make the argument that the ministries might be exempted from their substantive commitment if there were a change of government after the election. Therefore ministries could be more ambitious with setting longer than usual targets and agreeing to more or less common priorities. They could move out of their comfort zone and worked more closely with another traditionally rivalrous ministry. This frame has helped some ministries in Germany to get past or ‘postpone the resolution’ of the seemingly unresolvable inter-ministerial conflicts (G7C). It was also useful to test out the more risky positions that ministries took with a potential immediate exit, proving that the outcomes were not as poor as expected. Gaining more control over the process, the coordinator builds coalitions to extend their influence, which was usually limited for substantive integration. When a lower level of coordination failed, the coordinator might not move quickly into the next level without trialling the networked responsive coordination , which sought to influence connectors in the network of actors to ‘put in a good word’. Therefore, the coordinator needed two things: willing coalition and good idea. Firstly, weaker but ambitious ministries might form a coalition with the chancellery to push for a joint position that influenced more powerful and conservative ministries (G16B). This push, however, had to be ‘gentle and not domineering’ (G11B). It was also possible for the coordinator to form a coalition with ‘natural partners’, such as the Ministry of Regional Development and Ministry of Interior. These partners were familiar with the whole-of-government perspectives to collectively promote the adoption of the sustainable development agenda (C42B). Ministries that were more supportive of the inter-ministerial deliberation would form a coalition and communicate in common ‘bureaucratic language’ (Rouhinen, 2014 ). However, it was important to acknowledge that the coordinator needed to invest a significant amount of resources to scan, identify and respond to emerging opportunities for temporary substantive integration across all kinds of inter-ministerial negotiations (G5C, G56B). The coordinator had quick access to high-level decision makers and therefore had some capacity to influence the political agendas. Secondly, as a ‘powerful and effective communicator’, it could respond to requests from weaker ministries by placing neglected issues such as energy efficiency on the agenda, which aligned well with the broader sustainability principles (C42B). The ideas ought to be seen to come from the ministries themselves rather than the coordinator (G11B, C42B, G21B). With its convening power, a fairly strong centre of government as the coordinator was able to ‘introduce new ideas’, ‘set forth basic goals’ (G11B), ‘provide the big picture’ (F31B), and ‘help ministerial ideas gel together without defining the exact and detailed policy measures’ (F31B). All of these were achieved by slipping substantive integration into procedural integration when the coordinator had significant control over the latter. It might draw ideas from champion ministries for the sustainable development agenda (G8B, G9B). The coordinator would then create a new norm around ‘what was considered ambitious’. In this case, the interactions were ‘not so much strategy but power play’, interpreted by some ministries as collusion (G9B). Overall, if the central coordinator ‘was convinced that something should happen, it would happen’, including writing letters to the state secretaries of various ministries to influence the resolution of substantive integration (G10B).  5.6 Central coordination In answering the research question, a good coordinator can marshal different types of responsiveness to meet the right challenges. But who can achieve that better? In this section, it is suggested that a central coordinator is more responsive based on the 53 interviews with policy actors who had inside knowledge about this issue. There were pivotal changes in the ownership of portfolio on sustainable development, and the motivations behind the institutional changes. The analysis interrogates the rationales for Finland and the Czech Republic to move their central coordinator from the Ministry of Environment to the centre of government (i.e., Prime Minister's Office). It also seeks to understand the perceived advantages for keeping the central coordinator in the Chancellery in Germany, namely its neutrality in the hierarchy, its power to set norms, and its access to resources. Firstly, the central coordinator was naturally perceived as neutral in the hierarchy of ministries – relative to having a ministerial coordinator. Finland and the Czech Republic started with the Ministry of Environment as the coordinator and shifted the role to the centre of government (i.e., Prime Minister's Office), which saw greater participation of individual ministries in integration activities. The partial explanation is that ministries perceived the centre of government to be more neutral than any ministry in coordinating the SDGs agenda. Even when the lead ministry as the coordinator presented itself as neutral, the other ministries remained skeptical about what agendas they would support (F28B). When coordinating the agenda, Ministry of Environment would be accused of promoting the green agenda (F32B, F35B, F36B, F37B, C48C, G8B), and Ministry of Interior for security and terrorism (C58C, G11B). ‘Location has a lot of meaning’ (F37B). If the coordinator were located in the Prime Minister's Office, ministries would perceive the coordination of the agenda as more ‘neutral’ (F36B, C42B) or ‘without an agenda’ (C58C) by cutting across the economic, environmental and social dimensions of development (G14B, F29B, F37B, C43C) that were ‘scientifically and politically difficult to integrate’ (F34B). Such a natural advantage might have fuelled the ‘dream for the move’ from the Ministry of Environment to the Prime Minister's Office for many years (F33B). The assumed neutrality remained even if the coordinating personnel in the Prime Minister's Office used to be a staff member of the Ministry of Environment (F37B). Secondly, the neutrality was also coupled with power within the hierarchy of ministries. ‘We could not deny that hierarchy works. It was built in that ministries were all at the same level and Prime Minister's office was at a higher level’ (F38B; similar C42B), which meant it could ‘wake up’ (G14B) or ‘task’ (C48C) the ministries. The power also came from the impression of having the Prime Minister, who could instruct ministers, to be on the side of the coordinator (C42B). Moreover, ‘political leaders could then push for the topic [i.e., sustainable development]’ (C43C). Coordinators at the centre of government had ‘bigger muscles’ (F29B) and ‘sufficient clout’ (U53B) for enforcing greater compliance granting the agenda greater ‘institutional status’, ‘strategic positioning’ (F25A) and ‘bureaucratic legitimacy’ (F35B) – without which, ‘even the most charismatic secretary of state from a ministry would find leading this process a very difficult task’ (U53B). These observations made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Czech Republic resulted in this potential coordinator candidate opting out of the coordinator allocation process to support the centre of government taking up this role (C48C). Thirdly, the centre of government also had a greater access to resources than the ministries. The coordinator at the centre of government formed tighter and purposive ‘linkages with other policy areas’ (F36B), multiple existing agendas (F32B), ‘different sections of the whole administrative system’ and cutting edge work such as the Futures Work (F28B). With such a level of access, the centre of government was best positioned for ensuring the mainstreaming of sustainability principles was more ‘systematised’ and ‘automatic’ (F40B). The centre of government was the ‘central place for coordination’ (F28B), at which ministerial representatives that coordinate particular agendas or portfolios will be informing the coordinator of sustainable development agenda about the inter-ministerial conflicts (G56B). Fourthly, with a greater analysis capacity, the coordinator could not only aggregate ministerial inputs but also put forward a coordinator's view that might break the usual paths of siloed perspectives by ‘identifying problems not known to individual ministries or having a different take on the issues’ (C42B). The central coordinator could provide a ‘broad picture’ of the sustainable development agenda, which lacked details to be filled by individual ministries, especially at the start of the strategy development (F31B) if the analysis capacity of the coordinator were strengthened (G56B). Lastly, the adjudicating coordinator might advise on what was and was not sustainable. Compared to Finland and Germany, the central coordinator of the younger integration regime in the Czech Republic took on a more proactive role in providing sustainability impact assessment. It hoped to provide sustainability impact assessments to be fed directly to the Cabinet during crucial decision-making windows. The Germans have allocated this task to the independent Parliamentary Advisory Committee. A useful question is whether the Czech's central coordinator will lose its neutral image once it starts to criticize the substance of the policy proposals from individual ministries?   6 Discussion and conclusion 6.1 Responsive coordination in a nutshell This study has contributed to the literature by introducing the concept of responsiveness to policy coordination. While it is true that coordinators are likely to impose ideas on the coordinated through a hierarchy (Peters, 2013 ), the data in this study suggested that coordinators were more responsive than that. Coordinators were cognisant of the limits of their authority over the autonomous agencies, and therefore would select the right level of interventions for the right kind of coordination challenges. Recent literature reviews on policy coordination (Candel and Biesbroek, 2016 ; Cejudo and Michel, 2017 ; Tosun and Lang, 2017 ) have described these coordination strategies individually. This study adds to the literature by highlighting that the coordinator uses multiple strategies simultaneously depending on the challenges for summoning compliance from the ministries. The rule of thumb for the coordinator is to be a minimalist and not meddle with inter-ministerial negotiations on policy substances  that might have a lasting  impact on the ministries. The coordinator can be bossier with implementing bureaucratic procedures  for producing a whole-of-government strategy on sustainable development for a time period limited  to the policy development phase. Moreover, bureaucrats were more likely to achieve consensus on procedural rather than substantive coordination (Wong and van der Heijden, 2019 ). Building on this understanding, this study details how coordinators use different sets of strategies for the two types of coordination.  6.2 Reflections on responsiveness and neutrality Firstly, pyramidal responsiveness allows minimalist intervention to policy coordination, which is compatible with the observation that ministries resist interventions from coordinators by protecting their turfs legitimately (Bardach, 1998 ). Coordinators would be careful with imposing ideas that erode ministerial turfs, and therefore would spend their political capital wisely on the most necessary imposition (Peters, 2013 ). This study describes the coordinator as minimalist but also proportionate. It will escalate the intrusiveness of intervention one level at a time to demand eventual compliance from the ministries, especially on temporary processes for developing a whole-of-government policy output. To achieve consensus on adopting permanent processes across the government, coordinators would set the highest bar imaginable and then de-escalate proportionately to give back just enough control to the ministries for keeping them engaged. Secondly, meta-responsiveness offers the concept of coordinating at a distance. The coordination of sustainable development policies tends to produce institutional changes (i.e., temporal or permanent procedural coordination) but not policy changes (i.e., temporal or permanent substantive coordination) (Nordbeck and Steurer, 2016 ) possibly due to the limited control of coordinators over the latter. However, coordinators can still influence indirectly through the development of guidelines and framing of public messages as references to which ministries can voluntarily use. Related is the coordinator's vantage point for aggregating inputs and catalyzing changes by providing a collaborative platform (Ansell and Gash, 2018 ). The coordinators aggregate information on interactions across ministries, and provide a bigger picture. A coordinator is required to activate such a big-picture framework (Peters, 2013 ). Within this framework, the coordinators scan for opportunities to mediate conflicts between ministries, but not as a problem solver. Mediation keeps the coordinator at a distance and the framework alive. Finally, the networked responsiveness complicates the pyramidal responsiveness. The coordinators could influence through their networks before escalating their strategies. This is evident in the behaviours of central coordinators who built coalitions with several ministries for improving compliance from other ministries. However, there is insufficient data to demonstrate that the coordinators practiced the minimalist principle. It is particularly clear that the German coordinator may cooperate with a weak ministry to push for a neglected policy agenda, knowing that there will be significant ministerial resistance. Therefore, the coordinator would move quickly and forcefully to impose a particular priority without going through the slow escalation up the pyramid as predicted in the original concept of networked responsiveness (Braithwaite, 2017 ). The nuances are to be further explored. However, the available data strongly shows that the coordinators across the three countries did not act alone and frequently presented themselves in a coalition with some coordinated ministries to collectively impose the sustainability agenda on less supportive ministries. Apart from responsiveness, this study has highlighted the neutrality of the centre of government as the coordinator for implementing SDGs. Given that this central coordinator is strongly influenced by the top political leader, it is not absolutely but relatively more neutral than having ministries as the coordinator. The relative neutrality is also not objectively measured but subjectively perceived by the interviewees of this study. The relative and subjective neutrality has direct implications on whether the coordinated ministries are willing to participate in the policy process designed by the central coordinator. Practically, institutional designers need to seriously consider moving the coordinator for implementing SDGs from the ministries to the centre of government. Furthermore, new coordinators can systematically devise strategies for inter-ministerial coordination, which includes doing just enough (pyramidal), caring from a distance (meta), and influencing through peers (networked).  6.3 Limitation and unfinished inquiry Theoretically, despite its explanatory power, the limits of responsive regulation have not been extensively discussed. While the responsive regulation theory proposes a minimalist approach to interventions, the escalation up the regulatory pyramid does not prevent the use of highly coercive strategies when interventions of one level after another fail. The frustrated and worried coordinator may be eager to see results and resort to highly coercive strategies too quickly, especially if the institutional checks and balances are not effectively in place (Braithwaite, 2014 ). In the German and Czech Republic cases, ministries are divided on whether the coercion of central coordinators for making ministries comply with the procedures for inter-ministerial deliberation was necessary and without negative implications. The Finnish central coordinator, on the other hand, is exemplary in ‘walking softly and carrying a big stick’. It sought to move forward as fast as the consensus among ministries allowed with the authority of the centre of government but without the use of tricks and coercion. There are no formal checks here for situations whereby central coordinators ‘abuse’ their authorities in the name of generating desperate consensus on sustainable development commitments. It may be worth pondering in future research how central coordinators can rely more on networked responsiveness before escalating up the pyramid. Comprehensive and proactive institutionalization of networking that permits broader consideration of public interests in the coordination process may offer a way out of the limit of responsive regulation (Hong and You, 2018 ). On methodological limitations, the sample is not representative and therefore may be difficult to generalize to other countries. The three countries under investigation are European. When compared to other regions, the institutions in these countries may have particular research interests in climate-related SDGs, especially on sustainable consumption and production (Salvia et al., 2019 ). How the policy content (i.e., SDGs) affects the policy processes (i.e., inter-ministerial coordination) is beyond the scope of this study. Furthermore, the interviews primarily focused on the development of strategies for implementing SDGs between 2014 and 2017. The interviews have also captured the broad reflections on the long history of the sustainability community, indicating that institutions can adapt slowly and wither quickly. Therefore, the four coordination behaviours may be the result of all kinds of institutional changes, and they may not be as predictive of future behaviours. Future research may focus on four areas. Firstly, the central coordinator oversees portfolios across the government and therefore may be perceived naturally to be more neutral than individual ministries. However, what roles, activities or decisions would diminish the perceived neutrality significantly? For example, would adjudicating the quality of policy decisions through the sustainability lens be damaging to the perceived neutrality? Secondly, it would satisfy the curiosity of policy practitioners to understand the extent that the capacity of coordinators can influence their responsiveness. How would a larger coordinating team help deployment of more appropriate level and type of coordination strategies? Thirdly, the idea of responsiveness in coordination may be related to the flexibility of sustainability concepts. Does coordination of the sustainability agenda call for greater responsiveness than coordination of other agendas? Finally, responsive coordination may be desirable to keep the bureaucracy stable and harmonious, but the responsiveness can result in avoidance of necessary conflicts, which partially explains why transformational policy changes have not eventuated. (Wong and van der Heijden, 2019 ). When is it appropriate for the responsive coordinator to get into a ‘good fight’ in order to significantly advance the sustainability discourse?   Declarations of interest None.  Funding This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.
