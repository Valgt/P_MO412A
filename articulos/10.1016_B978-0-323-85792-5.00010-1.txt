               The management of organic waste is a huge menace in the current scenario. At the same time, it has also emerged as a potential contributor in creating a sustainable livelihood. However, due to several challenges, organic waste management coupled with sustainability is lagging far behind all over the world, specifically in developing countries. Since sustainability is the foundation for continuous development; an integrated approach is required to be promulgated amidst various stakeholders in creating a benchmark for the entire waste management system and livelihood for the people. This chapter is aimed to focus on the state-of-the-art review on organic waste management system with special attention on a sustainable livelihood for the people engaged in this occupation. The prevailing scenarios on the economic and health status of the workers engaged in the waste management field, associated challenges and opportunities are also discussed. The integration of enormous waste management coupled with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will lead to enhanced social livelihood, economic growth, improved health and safety, and sustainable resilient environment.

Keywords Municipal solid waste  Organic waste  Sustainable livelihood  Sustainable development goals   20.1 Introduction In the current developing scenario, solid waste management (SWM) has become one of the mammoth tasks all over the world. Historically, the waste generation was less as the consumption of resources was limited. Later with the advancement in the living standard of the communities, urban settlements the consumption of resources and generation of waste rose in parallel. Understanding the context of the rising menace of waste generation and potential threats to human health and the environment most of the countries, cities, and towns started taking up the initiation of waste management services. Several bodies like traders, informal groups, stakeholders, private-public partners (PPP), urban local bodies (ULBs), municipal corporations are involved in handling waste management services. Despite many initiatives, policies, and standards adopted by most of the countries, still it does not reach the benchmark level. Especially the urban areas in most of the countries are facing the overflow of the garbage, due to a shortage of space and infrastructure. Lack of waste data quantification and characterization of different categories of SW is also one of the biggest barriers in delineating an efficient and adequate management plan (Kumar et al., 2017 ). Municipal solid waste (MSW), commercial waste, biomedical waste, industrial waste, construction and demolition waste, agricultural waste sewage waste, and E-waste, are the major categories i.e., generated in large quantities in urban cities and towns. MSW is one of the most important and crucial categories of SW due to its unavoidable generation and extended management opportunities. As estimated the global MSW generation is 2.01 billion tonnes/ year out of which the majority of the waste is processed unscientifically (Kaza et al., 2018 ). The average per capita waste generation is around 0.74 kg varying from 0.11 to 4.54 kg, respectively (Kaza et al., 2018 ). The existing MSWM practices are observed to be opaque. Many urban municipalities are facing challenges with the implementation of effective waste management strategies and compliances. Thinking of the menace of the overflow of MSW several initiatives and schemes were brought under the ambit of administrating and regulatory bodies. An integrated system approach i.e. sustainable and cost-effective measures are required to be undertaken, to combat the existing gap between policies and standards making the waste managers more responsive and responsible through providing 360-degree accountability in the delivery of municipal activities. Management of MSW is itself is a challenging task due to its wide and diverse waste composition, such as organic waste, plastics, paper, metals and glass, textile waste, inerts, etc., and economic status as shown in Fig. 20.1  . Also, due to a lack of sufficient funds and job allocations in most of the countries, the management system is hindered without plans and services. As reported the door-to-door collection system does not reach every place due to a lack of systematic management plans. Also, the transportation of waste suffers due to a lack of optimized routes, fuel thefts, and a lack of responsibilities (Cheeseman et al., 2018 ). The lack of waste segregation means that MSW contains all kinds of waste from households including wet, dry, and sanitary, first-aid treatment waste, medical waste, expired medicines, E-wastes, and sharp objects. Local communities close to the open dumping grounds and landfill sites are very concerned about odor and air pollution problems associated with the site (Kumar et al., 2009 ). The people living near to the proximity have claimed about the potential threats to them caused by the vector-borne diseases, bad and fouling smell, and unhygienic surroundings. Most of the landfill sites in developing countries do not have a landfill liner system or leachate collection system and as result leachate is polluting ground water. Against the background of dwindling resources, the menace of solid waste, poverty, unemployment unhygienic conditions, and rising environmental problems a systematic and sustainable management system is required to mitigate the issues. This chapter is focused to bring the kind attention of the waste managers and decision-makers towards implementing systematic and sustainable waste management services in the working domain. As part of a sustainable waste management chain from cradle to cradle all the segments and fractions in the services should be engraved creating a sustainable livelihood ultimately meeting the SDGs (Fig. 20.1 ).  20.2 Organic waste generation Organic waste generation is directly proportional to rapid urbanization and the gross economic status of the country. Most countries especially the developing countries are struggling with the menace of the organic waste generation and management challenges due to limited resources, capacities, and public participation (Kumar et al., 2009 ). Organic waste generations are one of the critical and crucial MSW compositions that offer significant benefits when delineated appropriately. A large portion of MSW generated in the cities is organic waste, primarily the middle-income and low-income countries as shown in Fig. 20.3 . A study conducted by World Bank reported that the average per capita/day MSW generation in a city is 0.9 kg. The complex issues associated with organic waste management is high moisture content and that requires sustainable and cost-effective methods for recycling. As reported, huge quantities of organic waste are generated in most of the developing nations especially Asian countries, therefore the technology suitable to the waste composition is capable of handling the waste i.e. high organic and moisture content. The delineation of the most appropriate treatment methods is required to be understood depending on the waste composition its physical and chemical characteristics. There is a need to create awareness of the most appropriate waste management practices. It is possible to reduce the burden of the waste reaching the landfill and also extract value from waste by creating a circular economy approach to waste so as to utilize the waste for one as a resource for another. Households and apartments are the major contributors to organic waste in bulk quantities i.e., also known as domestic waste or residential waste as shown in Fig. 20.2  . Generally, household waste is categorized as dry, wet, sanitary, and hazardous waste, and E-waste, respectively. The wastes generated especially from domestic sources are highly efficient and potential sources of secondary resources when treated appropriately such as composting, energy production, high-value chemical products, etc. The generation of organic waste varies spatially and temporally but shows a consistent correlation with the climatic conditions, cultural diversity, food patterns, lifestyle, geographical patterns, and level of economy of the regions or country as shown in Fig. 20.3  . In most of the developing countries, household waste is commonly disposed of in the community bins and most reusable and recyclable materials are segregated beforehand. Sometimes, it has been observed in Indian middle-income groups the waste items such as glass, plastics, paper, textile, metals, etc., and all that is marketable are sold to the kabadiwala (waste pickers) or scrap dealers or scavengers based on the average market price of the item/kg (Arya and Kumar 2020 ). In a study conducted by Kumar et al., 2009  the community bins receive organic waste in bulk quantities (Kumar et al., 2009 ). It has been suggested that developing countries (Middle-income countries both lower and higher) have a high percent of organic waste (a major component of household waste) that can be utilized effectively for compost preparations (Kaza et al., 2018 ). So far, no comprehensive strategies have been assessed regarding household waste, linked to a systematic approach towards its appropriate and sustainable management options (Fig. 20.2 ). The necessity and significance have been felt with the aim to implement the existing sustainable waste management system of developed nations. For example, Japan generates nearly 65 million tonnes of waste of which 40 million tonnes are treated thermally. This systematic approach towards the waste management experiences and 3R policies of Japan is much more needed to be shared and concerned in other developing nations. The passage of the law for the promotion of utilization of recyclable resources (the Recycling law) and the 1991 amendment to the waste disposal and public cleansing law (the waste disposal law) in Japan should also be implemented in nations where the management system is poor (Fig. 20.3 ). 20.2.1 Existing scenarios of organic waste management The rising menace of the global waste problems, greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), and at the same time the SDGs 13 climate action has provoked towards taking immediate actions in its mitigations (UNDP, 2021 ). As reported the organic waste at the landfills are the major contributor to the emissions of methane gas production contributing to global warming and GHGs emissions. With the unavailability of suitable and cost-effective methods, funds, lack of technical skill and trained manpower, advanced equipment's and technology most of the organic waste is left unattended in urban areas. Thus, the unmanaged and unattended waste disposed at the open landfills and dumpsites are posing severe threats to human health as well as the environment and surroundings. Moreover, several regulations, directives, policies, and strategies have been addressed by the organization and policymakers all over the world in the favor of sustainable waste management. Several approaches have emphasized through 4R (reduce, recover, reuse and recycle) principles i.e., reduction in waste quantity and usage of landfills respectively, resource recovery, reusing of the reusable products, and recycling of the products leading to a circular economy and creating sustainable livelihood. The generation of organic waste has been expected to increase in vast amounts and change in composition as a result of changes in consumer behavior correspondingly with population growth and gross economic growth potential. The European Union (EU) surveyed the experiences to make the proposals strategies for the appropriate management of hazardous household products within a life cycle perspective. The Ordinance on producer responsibility for glass and cardboard packing introduced in Sweden in 1993 had made efforts since to increase recycling of household waste. Different waste sorting has been developed for household collection which has led to separate waste management strategies. Organic waste remains a problem in many developing countries due to a significant amount of waste generation, financial failure, lack of trained manpower, technical and management related issues for urban local bodies. MYT is a successful, simple, and easy technology, operating for several years since being developed for the MBT in Kahlenberg. It is also functional in Hangzhou (China) which has similar waste characteristics to developing countries. The MYT process is based on criteria like Waste Technology Value Chain Assessment i.e., capable of processing mixed waste thereby reducing the labor charge for waste segregation and degree of pre-processing. Also, it is Clean Technology i.e., socially acceptable. As compared to other technologies MYT is odor-free i.e., the process involves the liquefaction of odorous substance. MYT is mainly focused on the complete extraction of raw material and energy content from MSW providing output in the form of quality-assured fuels and energy-rich biogas.   20.3 Challenges and opportunities associated with the organic waste management The current status of waste management in most countries is meager and unsystematic due to the lack of sustainable methodologies and treatment options the waste quantification and characterization is limited. Also, the management suffers due to several other factors such as lack of active community participation, skill development, tools and assets, technologies, funds, and political agenda. In most countries the management of waste is looked after by the municipal corporations and ULBs, however, due to lack of funds, low qualified officers remain unreached with the advanced methods and technologies in the markets thereby fail to delineate the systematic planning towards the entire waste management. A few challenges are discussed below that need to be addressed in the legislation so that the management plan could be improvised. 20.3.1 Lack of skill and information  Delineating an appropriate technology, research and development require proper skill and information, thus lack of training manpower is the root cause of the failure of the value out of waste. For stakeholders, there is a need for training and capacity building on organic waste management. For example, the waste in Asian countries comprises of a higher amount of organic waste and simultaneously higher moisture content. Hence, one should be aware of the appropriate option towards the management of such waste and similarly for others. The manpower engaged in such scenarios should be made available with proper information's and training capacity building programs. In most of the counties, the segregation of the waste is least observed due to which the composition of the waste at the landfills and transfer stations gets complicated thus reducing the efficiency of the waste recycling (Ghosh and Di Maria, 2018 ).  20.3.2 Lack of funds and infrastructure  Sustaining the smooth and continuous functioning of any industry in the bio-waste refining industry is much essential. Governments' artificial fertilizer incentives distort the sustainable compost sector. Usually, the chemical fertilizers are marketed at subsidized rates so these discounts can be balanced with the subsidies on organic waste. The allocation of funds to the bio refining industries should be granted enough to support the collaboration between the municipal organization and ULBs towards the availability of feedstock and proper execution of the waste management projects. However, the desired outcomes are not necessarily delivered by the direct subsidies of capital costs (plant and machinery). As conventional fertilizers and non-renewable oil are highly subsidized, there should be some options for consumers to buy compost and renewable energy. Furthermore, in the case of manure, as it is shipped in bulk for direct sale to growers, a transport subsidy will be provided, as is often given to fertilizer firms. In the case of back-ended capital subsidies for plant costs (compost, biogas, or refuse fuel), the private sector could be considered whether the municipality operates the plant and the interest subsidy may be applied at a favorable discount rate for the whole debt repayment term (Gasu et al., 2017 ). Also, a promotional subsidy may help raise awareness among the wider consumer market, especially farmers, and encourage the use of compost and biogas. For the effective scaling-up of organic waste management funding, this form of financial assistance is crucial. Regardless of the government-selected financial assistance policy (reduced subsidies to chemical fertilizers or expanded subsidies to compost operators), a rigorous evaluation of the cost of opportunity (less land needed for landfilling, lower transport costs, lower landfill running costs, better local climate, etc. should be carried out to persuade decision-makers who manage scarce government budgets.  20.3.3 Political conflicts  The stiff competition created by informal and illicit waste operators or waste mafias is another important and popular problem faced by most companies. In the face of rival informal waste staff and scrap-dealers, companies such as Sampurn(e)arth and Bali Focus find it difficult to popularize their organized approach to integrated waste management. Some firms term the problem of human resources a big obstacle because it is difficult for businesses to recruit and maintain professional human capital, including staff and managers (ADB, 2011 ). As a crucial problem, a few businesses often refer to corruption at multiple points in the supply chain of waste management.  20.3.4 Poor or negligible implantation of rules  As revealed by numerous government reports, ULBs do not effectively enforce organic waste management. For ULBs with experience in organic waste management, there is a need to establish committed groups of officers and trained personnel. Adequate preparation and hands-on experiments would enable to recognize bottlenecks and take effective steps at the implementation stage (Joshi and Ahmed, 2016 ). Rag-pickers may be engaged across coordinated businesses to increase the quality of organic waste recycling and source segregation. However, this enormous opportunity has been overlooked due to a shortage of recycling businesses and the recognition of society.  20.3.5 Lack of technical and coordination  The choice of suitable equipment depends on the physical and chemical composition of the waste; the geographical conditions, climatic conditions, and the type of waste management system used (mixed or sorted). For small (less than 20 tonnes per day TPD) and medium-scale projects, mechanization is not necessary (less than 100 TPD). Capital-intensive anaerobic digestion plants and RDF require well-trained staff, resulting in a more costly choice for organic waste management. This choice should be carefully balanced against other less costly alternatives in the area and matched to accommodate the management and technological capability of the municipalities. As there is a concentration of cement kilns and manufacturing boilers, industrial towns are ideal areas for RDF (Innovations, 2016 ). Combined systems may also be considered where waste allows for the expense, power, and better segregation. Coordination among various ministries, including the environment, local government, agriculture, energy, and finance, is crucial for the promotion of organic waste recycling (Kumar et al., 2017 ).  20.3.6 Lack of awareness  More initiatives are required to raise the level of understanding within local populations and facilitate the segregation of waste sources. Households, stores, and institutions in the area do not conscientiously exercise the segregation of recyclable waste at the source. It is also important to educate farmers on the advantages of urban organic waste and move their total dependency away from chemical fertilizers. The key problems in the context of developing nations are that people are ignorant of AD biogas technologies and do not adopt the tradition of proper segregation of waste at the household level, resulting in the mixing of biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste, and that mixed waste cannot be used for biogas processing in bio digesters (Oates et al., 2018 ). Also, because of the mixing of new products with solid waste, the volatility of agricultural waste not only makes it impossible to extract energy from the waste but also makes the waste disposal process more energy-consuming.  20.3.7 Unavailability of advanced technologies and equipment's  There is also a shortage of functional structural set-up in urban local authorities for waste management and preparation and architecture, a lack of effective biogas technologies, a lack of technical and trained staff, and obsolete management information systems, fewer funds resulting in inappropriate waste management planning, and costly/faulty service and maintenance that inevitably affects the overall logistics. In a developing world, people lack funds to start or install expensive biogas plants for productive AD; however, the government offers incentives to minimize the pressure on people, but these systems have not been successfully applied on the ground and require a lot of refurbishment. The government has recently developed several policies and started separate schemes under different departments to turn waste into electricity, but it will also take time for those to enforce them successfully so that individuals and companies take advantage of these schemes to improve the Indian government's waste-to-energy mandate. There are also some technical difficulties, such as pretreating biomass to increase biogas production, but this approach adds up to the cost of generating biogas, so some alternative strategies have to develop to enhance the efficiency of the AD process. The elimination of unwanted gases is another problem that involves cost-effective scrubbing technologies to extract high calorific content methane and hydrogen-rich biogas to allow it fuel to be used for domestic as well as industrial uses in place of CNG/LPG. Biodigester architecture is another problem for a successful AD process as a single-stage digester has low cost but less performance such that multi-stage (two or three-stage) automated control system vessels will provide full output, but this again will add up to the cost of plant and need to overlook to lower down the cost (Bhatia et al., 2020 a). Therefore, to handle organic waste effectively and to establish an efficient and cost-effective biogas technology, these problems must be tackled systemically to solve all concerns about the production and proper maintenance of energy from organic waste.   20.4 Potential benefits articulated towards health and safety environment 20.4.1 Extended employment opportunities  Regarding social gains, the informal recycling industry could provide a means of steady income for between 4962 and 24,811 persons. This would have the beneficial impact of raising the degree of poverty, which is 14.4 percent at present. For example, in a study conducted by Sarker et al., 2019 , waste management has employed approximately 708 job positions towards maintaining the waste resource recovery facilities and 34 composting and vermiculture plants.  20.4.2 Clean water and sanitation  Access to clean water, health, and sanitation is a fundamental human right. As the world is aware of water scarcity, it is very important to incorporate sustainability at any level for future needs. More than 40 percent of people are plagued by water shortages, an unprecedented number that is expected to increase with temperatures. Significant steps have been proposed towards providing clean drinking water and sanitation services in most parts of the world. However, billions of people still lack basic services, mainly in rural areas. By 2050, at least one in four individuals is expected to experience recurring shortages of water (Pavi et al., 2017 ). The goal is much influenced by waste management. The enormous waste and its adverse impacts have severely affected the groundwater and surface water pollution through leachate percolation. Hence, significant steps could be explored towards maintaining the waste dumpsites and sanitary engineered landfills offering jobs for and reducing the potential threats.  20.4.3 Good health and well-being  For sustainable growth, public health is important. Widening economic and social gaps, accelerated urbanization, climate and environmental risks, the ongoing burden with the waste and other infectious diseases, and emerging problems such as non-communicable diseases are all taken into account. In order to meet environmental targets, end hunger, and reduce inequality, universal health care would be integral. Emerging public health priorities, including antimicrobial resistance, not directly included in the SDGs, still call for action. Yet in order to attain health-related SDGs, the planet is off track. Progress has been inconsistent, both between countries and inside them. The nation with the shortest and longest life expectancies has a 31-year difference between them. And although some nations have made tremendous gains, national averages mask the fact that more are left behind. To counter inequality and to create good health for all, multisectoral, rights-based and gender-sensitive approaches are important. The good health and waste management both are entwined with the occupational health and safety. The rag pickers or the waste managers engaged directly with processing and handling waste are exposed to severe threats to human health and environment. Hence, channelizing the waste managers into formalized management system would benefit the recyclers to attain a good health and well-being and sustainable livelihood.  20.4.4 Decent work and economic growth  In order to foster sustainable industrial development decent work and economic growth in the long term, enhanced waste management is necessary through decoupling of resource use and economic growth; the reduction of air, soil, and water pollution; and the production of jobs and livelihoods. It is estimated that 85 percent of Ahmedabad's overall employment is informal, while 45 percent of informal employees have no role in official governance systems. Some urban planners consider the approaches used by waste pickers to be unsophisticated (Bhatia et al., 2020 b). Substantial research shows that it could produce social, environmental, and fiscal gains to incorporate the informal sector into local waste management strategies. Improved working practices and higher wages can be observed in low-income family's dependent on waste collection, resulting in improved health outcomes and greater social integration. More reliable and cost-effective solid waste disposal will help municipal authorities and urban residents. One way in which informal workers can unite and offer an opportunity to revitalize and expand on conventional Indian economic systems is through cooperatives like SEWA (Rupf et al., 2015 ). Its removal from procurement procedures presents a serious obstacle to sustainable waste management practices. Allowing waste pickers' organizations to compete on local solid waste management contracts will have a hugely positive effect on the livelihoods of employees. Informal employees' groups have the ability to enable waste pickers to take part in structured administrative processes, such as tendering procedures. When securing their interests and preserving the versatility of these workers, they will promote their competition in national markets. In 2015, more than 204 million workers were unemployed, according to the International Labor Organization. Sustained economic growth, higher production levels, and technical advancement are encouraged through the SDGs. Encouraging creativity and job growth, as well as concrete steps to eliminate child labor, slavery, and trafficking in human beings, are crucial to this. With these goals in mind, the aim is for both women and men to gain complete and sustainable jobs and decent work by 2030.  20.4.5 Industry, innovation and infrastructure  Critical sources of economic growth and prosperity are an investment in technology and creativity. With more than half of the world's population now living in cities, urban transit and renewable energies, as well as the rise of emerging businesses and information and communication technology, are becoming more and more significant. Progress in technology is also essential to seeking lasting solutions to economic and environmental problems, such as creating new opportunities and encouraging energy conservation. Promoting renewable industries and engaging in basic research and engineering are all essential areas for sustainable growth to be promoted. More than 4 billion people are now unable to access the internet, and 90 percent are from developed countries. In order to ensure fair access to information and expertise, and to promote creativity and entrepreneurship, bridging this digital gap is essential.  20.4.6 Sustainable cities and communities  Seeking employment opportunities for a high standard of living is one of the major factors for migrating to urban cities. As estimated approximately 2/third i.e.,  6.5 billion people will be migrated to urban cities by 2050. The fact of continuous and rapid urbanization is inversely proportional to the development and city management plan and to accommodate the migrated population. Hence, the development of sustainable cities and communities is as much as crucial as providing a good quality of life to sustain. Waste management plays a very important role in delineating sustainable cities and communities. Thus, taking advantage of the waste generation and goal-oriented toward sustainable cities and communities a migrated manpower can be deployed as part of employment opportunity enhancing their sustainable livelihood. As a result of growing populations and increasing migration, the exponential development of cities has led to a boom in mega-cities, especially in the developed world, with slums being a more important feature of urban life.  20.4.7 Responsible consumption and production  A step forecasted towards global prosperity, reducing environmental footprints and sustainable development demands by reforming the way we generate and use goods and services. Agriculture is the world's greatest water user, and agriculture today accounts for up to 70 percent of all freshwater for human consumption. To accomplish this aim, the effective use of our common natural resources and the way we dispose of hazardous waste and toxins should be analyzed critically. It is equally important to enable enterprises, companies, and customers to recycle and minimize waste, as well as to help developed countries to transition towards more sustainable consumption habits by 2030. A substantial percentage of the world's population tends to eat way too little to satisfy even their minimum needs. Having global food waste per capita at the level of retailers and customers is also critical for developing more productive supply chains and production. It will assist with food preservation, as well as shift us towards a more resource-efficient economy.  20.4.8 Affordable and clean energy  The goal of affordable and clean energy coupled with waste management is directly oriented towards utilizing the maximum organic waste into biofuels. The approach and practices are continuously explored with success stories. However, the goal is much more to be emphasized with the rising menace of waste. The approach could potentially lead towards value generation, reduced waste burden, and at the same time creating sustainable livelihood. Much contribution and support are also expected towards meeting and accomplishing the goals. The Government in most countries is sought towards providing an alternative to capital-intensive waste-management strategies. Informal waste sector alliances can deliver less costly agreements while producing greater social and economic benefits. National governments should promote the systemic participation of informal waste pickers in urban waste management systems by, for example, eliminating legislative and functional obstacles to the contracting of waste picker cooperatives by municipalities; reducing policy prejudices against technical solutions; and making waste producers responsible for the post-consumption collection, recycling, and reuse. Development can be promoted and benefit the climate by improving infrastructure and updating technologies to provide safer and more productive electricity in all countries.  20.4.9 Climate action  Efforts to incorporate catastrophe risk initiatives, sustainable use of natural resources, and human protection into national growth policies must therefore go hand in hand with these actions. With strong political will, increased spending and the use of existing technologies, it is still possible to restrict the global mean temperature rise to two degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial period, with a goal of 1.5 °C, but this requires immediate and aggressive concerted action. Generating knowledge and translating it into action would result in win-win outcomes for both ecological environments and human growth that contribute to dignity and sustainability. Together with the government, numerous civil society organizations should engage and invest in water research and production, hygiene, and sustainability sanitation facilities and encourage those innovations and research conducted in the field (Fig. 20.4  ).   20.5 Integrating sustainability with organic waste management for sustainable livelihood Sustainability is the foundation for continuous development. The enormous waste generation and its management integrated with SDG will lead to enhanced social livelihood, economic growth, and a clean environment (Pappu et al., 2007 ). Also, it encompasses the sustainable management of natural resources, reduced burden of a waste generation with enormous potential benefits. Recycling organic waste adopting environment-friendly approaches leads to sustainable products thus contributing to the SDGs. For example, composting organic waste offers an extended business opportunity, unlocking new markets in organic waste recycling, green economy, strengthens the scientific and technological aspects towards meeting the SDGs such as SDG 3, SDG 6, SDG 7, SDG 8, SDG 11, SDG 12 SDG 13. The integration of sustainability concepts focus on viable management and social responsibility of all and sundry and create a clean and sustainable resilient environment. Keeping the above context a sustainable state-of-art is presented below. As per the Paris Climate Agreement goals, sustainable and effective waste management is a key player towards meeting its objective. It was reported that approximately 5 percent of the global GHGs is caused due to the present waste generation in urban cities and is expected to replicate itself by 10 percent in 2020. Adopting scientific and sustainable methods coupled with traditional methods and 4R principles i.e., reduce, recycle, reuse, and recover could contribute to meeting the SDG and its targets at a rapid pace. Also, the contribution of the ruling government of the country is more important towards delineating an effective waste management plan (Njoroge et al., 2013 ). The support and leadership from the higher authorities to the municipal corporation helps in delivering and formalizing the informal sectors. The approach of formalizing the informal groups is to provide them job security improvising their good health and well-being, gender equality, decent work, and economic growth as shown in Figs. 20.5   and 20.6  . 20.5.1 Sanitation worker at your door step  The scheme of the Centre for Development Communication (CDC) has been identified as good practice by “UN HABITAT” (Earthscan, 2010 ). Sanitation worker is the term for the rag pickers and private sweepers in the informal sectors. Previously the informal workers worked under the most unhygienic conditions, but now these sectors are receiving major attention and focus as part of an organized formal waste management sector. Under this scheme all aspects of solid waste management, from waste collection to waste processing and final disposal are performed in a systematic manner that ensures the health and safety and livelihood of the workers. The scheme is adhered to be adopted in India and other developing nations as well that includes the following aspects i.e. Daily door to door waste collection • Waste segregation at source  • Waste collection and transportation  • Employment generation  • Maintenance of a neat and clean city  • Awareness building    a) Door-to-door collection and concept of a bin-free city    The concept of making a bin-Free zone could be one of the most efficient and sustainable approaches towards sustainable management of waste at the same time generating livelihood. The concept of bin free city acts as moving waste receptacles, reducing the no. of bins simultaneously and eliminating the waste from various collection points directly to the waste collection and vehicles. This occurred at the same time as an increase in door-to-door waste collection. Nagpur, Maharashtra, India has done significant and outstanding efforts in reducing the numbers drastically every year (Cheeseman et al., 2018 ). The waste is collected door-to-door by workers employed by the municipal corporations. The ultimate goal of this concept is to divert the waste from littering on the roads and several other associated problems at the same time formalizing the waste management services and providing a sustainable livelihood. For example, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India has set an ideal approach towards formalizing the informal groups and providing job security. The Ahmedabad municipality has collaborated with the informal workers to secure their monthly earning that ranged from $25 (1845 INR) to $85 (6270 INR). The second important aspect of the waste management services is the intermediate collection of waste i.e., from the primary source to secondary transfer stations and there to landfill sites. The longer the waste is allowed to accrue at the source; it starts creating a nuisance, unhygienic, and damage to the aesthetic beauty of the area. The collection of waste from the source of generation i.e. residential/commercial to the disposal site is possibly achieved by the synergy between the generators and the collectors. b) Waste segregation     Due to lack of awareness and poor community participation, the waste in most of the places is mixed and disposed of in the bins, community bins, etc. MSW comprises waste from the household, commercial, and market areas, industrial areas, and others. Segregation of waste is one of the most important aspects of waste processing technology. Household waste is itself comprised of waste that is degradable, recyclable, and hazardous. In such a situation, huge amount of money is invested in its processing. To avoid critical secondary challenges the waste segregation at the source stations could be alternative and sustainable concepts. The approach would benefit the workers with job security as waste segregation as well as improving their health and hygiene at the same cost reduction towards expensive expenditure over advanced equipment and energy consumption. c) Waste  storage    Storage of waste at the source is one of the most remarkable steps for successful waste management practices. Being the most diverse regions and countries all across the world, such as culture, tradition, food style, myths, and daily routine activities, waste generation is also diverse and dynamic. Thus the engagement of laborers and workers towards appropriate storage of the waste would contribute to efficient management and providing livelihood to them. d) Waste  transportation    Waste transportation is one of the most crucial and important aspects of waste management. A closed body fabricated vehicles with compactors to transfer waste to different transfer stations and recycling companies’ offers job security to the workers with significant benefits to health and safety and environment (Fig. 20.5 ).  20.5.2 Smart city innovation  The 2030 SDGs puts great emphasis on issues relating to sustainable urbanization, making it inclusive, secure, resilient, and sustainable for cities and human settlements. The rate of waste generation is rising tremendously with rapid urbanization. It is extremely difficult for cities to procure, isolate, and use multiple forms of waste that can theoretically be returned to a commodity life cycle. Usually, waste treatment entails waste monitoring, aggregation, transport, sorting, recycling, and disposal. Smart city innovations are steps towards designing and building a sustainable outlay of a city that involves intelligent waste management programs i.e., minimize waste and categories the form of waste at the source, and build solutions to treat waste properly. To turn waste into a resource and generate closed-loop economies, such systems can be used. Their key advantages are the reliability of waste storage, collection, separation, reuse, and recycling. The failure to anticipate where garbage is to be cleaned up is one of the key inefficiencies in waste management; trucks are often dispatched to gather waste when bins are not complete (Nations, 2016 ). Sensors, networking, and the Internet of Things have opportunities to reduce increased costs stemming from such inefficiency. Intelligent waste management technologies make it possible to track the passage of various forms of waste, and technology can be leveraged to help understand and control the distribution of waste from source to disposal. Such ventures are currently being piloted in the United Arab Emirates of Santander, Spain, and Sharjah (Oates et al., 2018 ).  20.5.3 Formalizing informal recyclers and rag pickers  Owing to the difficulty and rigidity of procurement procedures, waste pickers are often disqualified from winning local contracts for solid waste collection, either directly or indirectly. National governments should officially identify waste collection (and associated jobs) as a profession, so that it is easier to document the number of people engaged in reducing waste and improving livelihoods for all (Carl et al., 2019 ). Lessons from Ahmedabad, India and their working conditions on waste management can be channelized in other cities and towns as well. The city also involves in authorizing the decentralized employee unions to engage in tendering procedures, such as requesting bidders to have particular categories of employees or allowing municipalities to recruit non-tendered waste picker cooperatives. Since unsegregated waste is discarded in neighborhood containers, it is not feasible to optimally recycle it. Rag-pickers, however, commonly sort and pick and sell recyclable items such as plastics, bottles, etc. Almost all recyclable material in Pondicherry is sorted out by rag-pickers and absorbed through recycling in the material stream (Pattnaik and Reddy, 2010 ). According to an estimation, rag-pickers minimize transport and garbage loads by up to 20 percent Unfortunately, the role of rag-pickers in SWM, who are one of India's major stakeholders, has not been adequately acknowledged so far. To improve and raise their morale, their position needs to be accommodated in the proper structure. However, rag-pickers work for the unorganized industry, so it is important to bring in place a better organized sector for waste reuse and recycling in order to create more jobs and income, aside from reducing the burden on transport and landfills. The study also found, however that informal waste pickers contribute positively to sustainability by driving creativity, producing jobs and profits, building a “green economy,” saving resources and landfill space for communities, and helping to alleviate the climate change crisis.  20.5.4 Youth engagement and community awareness  It is important to engage the society and youth in close collaboration with the city authorities, to raise awareness and inform people about waste and a safe climate. This is to be achieved at particular hours by implementing a door-to-door waste pickup operation to reach the sustainability goals. For, example the residents living in apartments and complexes should be inspired to take the charge as civil wardens and to join a commission on waste management. Through demonstrating strategies and benefits of waste separation and a safe climate, and by sharing the word during public gatherings, organizing lectures and workshops in community halls attached to local temples, time and effort have been invested into raising awareness. However, the key awareness-raising tactic was door-to-door communication with every household. Plans are also underway to conduct awareness programs for NSS volunteers, students, members of a self-help community, and residential association's members should help individuals understand the topic of MSW disposal and include them in sound control initiatives The results are more garbage disposal tax revenue, less waste being dumped into the streets and thus a healthier urban climate.   20.6 Conclusion The aim towards transforming a sustainable environment into a well-planned, eco-friendly city connecting people and spaces seamlessly is the most important and crucial factor in meeting SDGs. The plan also aims to create a clean, green, and inclusive ecosystem so that the vision of a Smart City can be achieved. An Integrated SWM is critically important. The ‘sanitary worker at your doorstep’ scheme is an effective way to collect waste and employing workers formerly from the informal sector. The scheme has a significant impact on the most downtrodden segment of the society through creating livelihood, earning at least minimum wages up to $25 (1845 INR) to $85 (6270 INR), and additional income from segregated recyclable material. The scavengers engaged in waste collections get dignified employment, with a proper uniform and protective gears and assets for waste management. The Bin-Free city initiative also significantly reduces the clogging of the open drains, sewers, rivers, and other waterways. The key message is that the Bin-Free City and ‘Sanitary Worker at Your Doorstep’ scheme are effective approaches in making sustainable cities and communities, clean water and sanitation, and associated goals. However, the long-term active community participation is needed and required to disseminate the initiative effectively. In addition to the waste management services, municipal corporations and ULBs are required to pay more attention to waste infrastructure and maintenance at the landfills and waste processing industries to mitigate fire hazards, odor problems, and other environmental issues that adversely influence public health.
