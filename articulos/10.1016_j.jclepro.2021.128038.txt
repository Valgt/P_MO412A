                  Differences in water resource endowment and socio-economic development of transformed urban agglomerations (TUAs) lead to differences in the ability of cities to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG6), which inevitably underestimates the possibility of water crises. This study employs the water footprint (WF) and reduced water planetary boundary (WPB) as absolute environmental sustainability indicators and uses a drive-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework to describe the spatio-temporal differences and evolutionary characteristics of the ability of a TUA to achieve SDG6. This study takes the Guanzhong urban agglomeration (GUA) in China as a case. The WF of GUA increased from 19.55 billion m3 to 23.44 billion m3 in 2007–2018, but it increased initially and then fell. The proportion of the ecological environment WF increased by 1.41%, which is in line with SDG6.4 and SDG6.6. However, WF is larger than WPB. The water deficit was within the interval of [6 billion m3, 23 billion m3]. The pressure subsystems in Tongchuan and Weinan were as high as 28.80%, and the response subsystems in Xi'an and Baoji had the highest weights of 33.79% and 25.84%, respectively. Thus, GUA is under severe water pressure. Causal chain relationships between the socio-economic activities of each city in the water resource system were not the same, reflecting a spatial difference in the ability to achieve SDG6. To this end, this study proposes the potential value and policy implications of reducing the differences in the ability of cities to achieve SDG6 to avoid water crises in TUAs.

Editor:Bin Chen Differences in water resource endowment and socio-economic development of transformed urban agglomerations (TUAs) lead to differences in the ability of cities to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG6), which inevitably underestimates the possibility of water crises. This study employs the water footprint (WF) and reduced water planetary boundary (WPB) as absolute environmental sustainability indicators and uses a drive-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework to describe the spatio-temporal differences and evolutionary characteristics of the ability of a TUA to achieve SDG6. This study takes the Guanzhong urban agglomeration (GUA) in China as a case. The WF of GUA increased from 19.55 billion m3  to 23.44 billion m3  in 2007–2018, but it increased initially and then fell. The proportion of the ecological environment WF increased by 1.41%, which is in line with SDG6.4 and SDG6.6. However, WF is larger than WPB. The water deficit was within the interval of [6 billion m3 , 23 billion m3 ]. The pressure subsystems in Tongchuan and Weinan were as high as 28.80%, and the response subsystems in Xi'an and Baoji had the highest weights of 33.79% and 25.84%, respectively. Thus, GUA is under severe water pressure. Causal chain relationships between the socio-economic activities of each city in the water resource system were not the same, reflecting a spatial difference in the ability to achieve SDG6. To this end, this study proposes the potential value and policy implications of reducing the differences in the ability of cities to achieve SDG6 to avoid water crises in TUAs.

It is estimated that 66% of the population will live in cities by 2050 (United Nations, 2014 ). The resulting shortage of water resources will increase the possibility of conflicts among stakeholders in urban agglomerations (Jia et al., 2020 ) and will cause the original uneven distribution of water resources to evolve into a water shortage crisis (Lv et al., 2020 ). At present, more than 2 billion people in the world still live in water-scarce countries, with 31 countries having water pressure thresholds between 25% and 70% and 22 countries having water pressure thresholds greater than 70% (UN-Water, 2016 ). Among the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) proposed by the United Nations, the goal to “ensure the supply and sustainable management of water and sanitation facilities for all ” is defined as SDG6. SDG6 not only requires water resources to be sustainable in terms of supporting urban development and ecological service value, but also requires the ability to maintain or improve living standards without damaging the access of future generations to water resources. There is a serious shortage of water resources in China, which is listed by the United Nations as one of the 13 most water-poor countries. Northwest China is arid, and water resources are unevenly distributed in spatio-temporal. The land area of Northwest China accounts for 41.4% of the country's total land area, but the total annual water resources account for only approximately 10% (Wang et al., 2019 ). Water shortages have become a problem that restricts the sustainable use of water resources in the north-western urban agglomerations. In recent years, the Guanzhong urban agglomeration (GUA) has leaped from the middle to latter stages of industrialization. The speed of transformation has accelerated, manifested in population growth and industrial agglomeration. As a result, the demand for water resources has increased, with a concomitant increase in sewage treatment volume. However, the ability to increase the water supply and improve water quality has not been enhanced. The development of urban agglomerations has made it difficult to eliminate practical problems related to path dependence and achieve SDG6.3 and SDG 6.4. In addition, the rural water intake facilities in the GUA are backward, and the quality of drinking water is substandard. There is a large gap in the ability to achieve SDG6.1. However, since most household drinking water treatment equipment available on the market is relatively expensive, there is a lack of cheap and affordable filters and treatment technologies for household sewage in rural areas (Hussain and Al-Fatlawi, 2020 ). The rural drinking water in the GUA still poses a large potential safety hazard, which seriously affects the health of rural residents. The complex relationships among the sub goals of the 17 SDGs (Fu et al., 2019 ) make it particularly difficult for transformed urban agglomerations (TUAs) to realize SDG6. One of the salient features of TUAs is that with rapid population growth and the rapid expansion of urban space, water resources have undergone a rapidly changing relationship with the socio-economic system. Due to the large differences in regional resource endowments and uneven load of pollutants (Shi et al., 2015 ), this condition has led to “polluted paradise ”. Therefore, it is determined that the key to enhancing the stability of the ecosystem and improving people's livelihoods is to assess whether the water resource utilization of TUAs reaches the level required by SDG6. Achieving SDG6 presents an opportunity for TUAs and a basis for coping with new water challenges. Water resource constraint is a long-term problem that hinders the sustainable development of TUAs. It is particularly important to carry out assessments of the sustainability of water resources. The realization of SDG6 within the safe operation boundary of water resources is a difficult problem. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been used in environmental sustainability assessment. The objects of research and discussion are usually related to products and services (Khoo et al., 2019 ; Vinci et al., 2019 ). Moreover, most traditional LCA do not consider the impact related to the use of water and ignore the problem associated with the total amount of water used for the production of products, which underestimates the damage to the environment (Payen et al., 2015 ). To make up for this shortcoming, studies have combined LCA and the water footprint (WF) to assess the impact of freshwater use (Dekamin et al., 2018 ). However, the results obtained by LCA can show only the proportion of the WF in each account in the entire life cycle and thus cannot quantitatively reflect the WF. Rockström et al. (2009)  set the safety boundary with seven physical biological processes and proposed a framework of planetary boundaries (PBs) that may cause irreversible and nonlinear changes in the earth system. The global environmental sustainability standard is based on the PBs. PBs define environmentally safe operation spaces in consideration of human well-being and development and overcome the shortcoming of LCA, which quantifies only small changes in environmental interference levels (Bjørn et al., 2016 ). It is possible to combine LCA and PBs to assess environmental sustainability (Tuomisto et al., 2012 ), which is a relative environmental sustainability evaluation method. However, PBs based on LCA will lead to uncertainty in the results due to issues such as the definitions of the thresholds (Sala et al., 2020 ). LCA focuses on global issues (Dong and Hauschild, 2017 ), and it is difficult to account for regional differences in water resources (Ryberg et al., 2016 ). In addition, LCA is product-oriented, and it is usually used to compare alternatives and evaluate the environmental impacts of different products based on the same method (Karlsson Potter and Röös, 2021 ). However, a single product has a small impact on the water planetary boundary (WPB). Therefore, WPB cannot be used as a benchmark for LCA, and an “absolute environmental sustainability index ” needs to be established to measure the threshold of the earth's boundary (Bunsen et al., 2021 ). Accordingly, the method combining the WF and WPB provides a new perspective for evaluating the sustainable use of water resources. It can measure the sustainability gap between the current scale of human activities and the capacity thresholds of the water resource environment (Fang et al., 2015 ). Although the global WPB has not been surpassed, excessive water withdrawal in some areas will cause the collapse of the regional water resource environment (Gerten et al., 2013 ), which means that exceeding the regional boundary may cause irreversible damage to the water resource environment. The uneven distribution of water consumption pressure and the related benefits among regions or groups of people will cause problems in environmental justice, responsibility sharing, and scarce resource allocation. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development  clearly puts forward fair but differentiated responsibilities. Using the principle of fair quotas to reduce WPB is conducive to balancing the pressure on regional water consumption. The PBs framework defines the biophysical boundaries of the critical earth system. To avoid irreversible changes and ensure that the earth system is in the current Holocene-like state, human activities should be restricted to PBs. However, the relative environmental sustainability assessment method cannot judge the absolute sustainable nature of a certain human activity (International Organization for Standardization, 2006 ). Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the size of the entire safe operation space to reflect the spatial differences in local water resources (Huang et al., 2020 ). Assigning WPB to activities, regions and other research subjects not only sets reasonable goals for assessing the sustainability of water use and its influencing factors (Dong et al., 2021 ), but also provides a basis for policy formulation and guidance on the use of water resources. The 17 SDGs were formulated based on national governing principles and ignored the importance of the diversity of local government water management policies, which are the basis of sustainable development actions (Gil et al., 2019 ). Considering only a country or certain city cannot fundamentally solve the problem of water shortages in urban agglomerations. The WF reflects the water consumption in a country, province, city or river basin. It can be used to evaluate the impact of human activities on the sustainability of water resources in different regions (Cao et al., 2018 ). However, the ability of the figures calculated according to the WF and WPB to reflect impacts on the environment and sustainability is limited. It is necessary to apply the drive-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework to further explore the changing characteristics of the complex relationship between water resources, the environment, and social and economic activities (Peng and Deng, 2020 ). Although it is difficult to connect the pressure changes of the earth system with the corresponding responses, it is still necessary to connect the drive of socio-economic development and the increasing environmental pressure with the response and avoid simple linear causal thinking by analysing paths of mutual influence. Therefore, it is necessary to combine footprints, PBs, and DPSIR to explore how the earth system responds to the pressure measured by footprint indicators (Vanham et al., 2019 ). This study proposes that there are differences in the ability to achieve SDG6 between regions. A key prerequisite is to quantify the occupation of water resources by human activities and make it clear that these pressures pose a threat to the water resource environment that can provide human survival and development capabilities. Therefore, the WPB is reduced based on the principle of fair quotas, and the WF and WPB are used to represent water consumption and its safety limits, respectively. In contrast to the sub-goals of SDG6, the DPSIR framework is used to construct a water resource sustainable development assessment framework, taking the GUA as a case study. The main contributions of this study involve the following two aspects. Firstly, a method for assessing the absolute sustainability of water resources in the TUAs is established by combining the WF and the reduced WPB. The DPSIR framework is constructed to explore the complex relationship between water resources and socio-economic activities for comparative analysis of the capabilities and differences of the cities in the TUAs in achieving SDG6, which is beneficial for summarizing, innovating and enriching water resource ecological space governance practices. Secondly, the uneven distribution of water consumption pressure and related benefits will affect environmental justice, responsibility sharing, and scarce resource allocation, which will hinder coordinated development strategies for the TUAs. This study holds that narrowing the differences in the ability of cities to achieve SDG6 can enable the TUAs to meet new water challenges and avoid water crises, indicating its potential value and policy implications. By comparing the changing trends of water consumption in cities, it proposes possible paths by which the TUAs can realize SDG6, broadens the study and application fields of 17 SDGs in the TUAs, and provides a scientific basis for local governments to formulate relevant policies. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2  elaborates on the study area, methods and data after the introduction. Section 3  discusses the dynamic changes in the WF and the changing characteristics of the sustainable use of water resources and their spatial and temporal evolution. Section 4  discusses the main contributions of this study compared with existing research. Finally, section 5  draws conclusions, provides suggestions, and identifies limitations.  2 Methods and data sources 2.1 Study area The GUA (Fig. 1  ) is located in the Weihe River Basin between the Northern Shaanxi Plateau and the Qinling Mountains. The GUA has a flat terrain, diverse industries and good agricultural production conditions. The GUA is one of the regions with relatively good resource endowments in Northwest China. The GUA includes five cities: Xi'an, Xianyang, Baoji, Tongchuan, Weinan, and the Yangling Agricultural High-tech Industry Demonstration Zone (Yangling for short). The GUA had a land area of 55,600 km2  (Shaanxi Provincial Bureau of Statistics, 2019 ), accounting for 27.05% of Shaanxi Province (Shaanxi for short). In 2020, the GUA had a permanent population of 25,875,539 (Shaanxi Provincial Bureau of Statistics, 2021a ) and a GDP of 245.05 billion USD (Shaanxi Provincial Bureau of Statistics, 2021b ), accounting for 65.46% and 64.56% of those of Shaanxi, respectively. According to the income standard released by the World Bank in 2020 (The word bank, 2020 ), the per capita income level increased from the “low-middle income ” level of 1,475 USD per person in 2007 to the “high-middle income ” level of 8,625 USD per person in 2017, with obvious transition characteristics. According to current United Nations standards, a country with per capita water resources of less than 1700 m3  will encounter water shortages (Eurostst Statistics Explained, 2019 ). In 2018, China's per capita water resources was 1971.80 m3  (National Bureau of Statistics, 2018 ), while that of the GUA was only 299.65 m3  (Shaanxi Provincial Bureau of Statistics, 2019 ), which is less than 1/6 of the national per capita average. The GUA was experiencing an extreme water shortage. In terms of water resources, the GUA has abundant rainfall and abundant surface water and groundwater resources. However, the water system is affected by a reduction in river flow during the dry season, and the water body has poor self-purification capabilities, which can easily lead to heavy pollution. In the past ten years, the largest amount of water resources was 11.87 billion m3  in 2011 (Shaanxi Provincial Water Resources Department, 2011 ), and the smallest was 5.23 billion m3  in 2016 (Shaanxi Provincial Water Resources Department, 2016 ). The GDP of the GUA grew at an average annual rate of 14.15% from 2007 to 2018. However, the average annual growth rate of total water resources was only 2.83%. Although the water consumption per ten thousand RMB of the GDP in 2018 was 36.23 m3 , it decreased by 262.85% from 131.46 m3  in 2007. Thus, the contradiction between water supply and demand remains prominent, and water utilization efficiency still needs to be improved. At the same time, the water quality of the GUA has not improved significantly. The amount of waste and sewage discharge increased from 0.79 billion m3  in 2007 to 0.98 billion m3  in 2018, resulting in a sharp decrease in the amount of available water resources. According to the Bulletin of the State of the Ecological Environment  for each city (district) in the GUA in 2019, the concentration of pollutants such as ammonia nitrogen, total phosphorus and the permanganate index in Xi'an exceeded the standard. The water quality status of the Sanlidong monitoring section and fork monitoring section in Tongchuan indicated light pollution and moderate pollution, respectively. The fragility of the water resource system caused by the decline in the total amount of water resources and water pollution is becoming a problem that cannot be ignored if the GUA hopes to achieve SDG6.  2.2 Methods 2.2.1 Modelling: general remarks The WF includes accounts such as the agricultural production WF, industrial production WF, daily life of residents WF, ecological environment WF, and imported and export virtual water. By narrowing the WPB, it can be applied to areas below the global scale. Compare it with the WF to evaluate the sustainability of water resources and determine the amounts of water deficit and water surplus, which are indicators of whether the regional water resources comply with SDG6. If the region does not meet the SDG6 standard, a DPSIR model needs to be established to analyse the spatio-temporal characteristics of water resource sustainability (Fig. 2  ).  2.2.2 Calculation of the water footprint The WF refers to the real amount of water resources consumed by products and services to meet the needs of residents under a certain standard of living (Hoekstra, 2003 ). The Water Footprint Network developed the international standard for WF evaluation (Water footprint network, 2019 ), dividing the national consumption WF calculation methods into two types: “bottom-up ” and “top-down ”. The former is based on the perspective of consumption, considering that products and services have greater mobility, and water consumption may stem from other regions. This method is more suitable for WF calculations for individuals, companies, and communities for which import and export data cannot be obtained. The latter is based on the assumption of local water resource consumption and can account for the national WF from the perspective of production (Hoekstra, 2009 ). This study uses the “top-down ” method to calculate the direct WF and indirect WF (Li et al., 2017 ). The WF calculation formulas are provided in Appendix B  Eqs. (B.1) - (B.3).  2.2.3 Setting the water planetary boundary The WPB quantifies the space for the safe operation of human activities on a global scale. The equal per capita (EPC) (Lucas et al., 2020 ) method is used to allocate the global budget according to the share of the population of a certain region in the global population. This method can be applied to regions smaller than the national scale. When the WF is greater than the WPB, the regional water intake exceeds the safe range, resulting in a water deficit. The larger the water deficit is, the less sustainable the use of water resources. When the WF is smaller than the WPB, a water surplus is generated. The larger the water surplus is, the higher the level of sustainable use of water resources (Fang, 2014 ). The WPB calculation formulas are provided in Appendix B  Eqs. (B.4) - (B.6).  2.2.4 Establishment of the DPSIR model In 1999, the European Environment Agency developed a comprehensive environmental reporting and assessment framework (European Environment Agency, 1999 ). The DPSIR model describes the causal relationship between human needs and behaviours and the ecological environment system (Pinto et al., 2013 ), laying a foundation for evaluating the role of TUAs’ water resource systems in achieving the SDGs. In the causal chain relationship between urban social and economic activities and the water resource system (Fig. 3  ), GDP growth, population growth, and increases in cultivated area are factors that drive changes in the water resource system. The impact of water quality and water volume under the pressure of water resources and other water resources thereby affects the water environment and highlights the need to implement response measures to improve the environment (Sun et al., 2016 ). Based on the degree of impact of each indicator on the sustainable development of water resources, the weight of each factor is determined by the entropy method (Yang and Hu, 2019 ). The calculation formulas are provided in Appendix B  Eqs. (B.7) - (B.10).   2.3 Data sources First, to calculate the WF, data were obtained from the 2008–2019 Shaanxi Provincial Statistical Yearbook  and the 2007–2018 Shaanxi Water Resources Bulletin . The exchange rate of USD to RMB from 2007 to 2018 was obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics, and missing data were extrapolated using the average annual growth rates. Second, to calculate the WPB, permanent population data on the GUA were obtained from the 2008–2019 Shaanxi Provincial Statistical Yearbook , and data on the total world population were obtained from the Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Dynamics  (United Nations, 2019 ).  The global WPB was set to 4,000 billion m3  (Steffen et al., 2015 ). Finally, data on the DPSIR indicators were obtained from the 2008–2019 Shaanxi Provincial Statistical Yearbook , the national economic development bulletins of the cities (districts) in the GUA, and government websites. Missing data were replaced with existing year data. The forest coverage area was replaced by forestland area. Data were obtained from the Resource and Environment Data Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, including raster data for 2010, 2015, and 2018. The data source is Landsat TM/ETM remote sensing images, which have an accuracy of 1,000 m.   3 Results 3.1 Dynamic changes in the water footprint Both the total WF and the WF of each city showed a trend of rising initially and then falling from 2007 to 2018 (Fig. 4  ). The total WF in the GUA increased from 19.55 billion m3  in 2007 to 23.44 billion m3  in 2018, which was an increase of 19.93%. Since 2007, the permanent population of urban agglomerations has increased by 1,124,400, which shows that concentration and rapid population growth has accelerated the growth of the water demand. Water consumption has also increased with the increase of the urbanization rate, improvement of living standards and improvement of water supporting facilities. The WF of GUA dropped from 29.79 billion m3  to 23.44 billion m3  in 2016–2018. The decline in the WF reflects the increased awareness of the damage caused by socio-economic development to the water resource environment. The water-saving society construction plan has be issued by Shaanxi in 2017. On the one hand, the plan improved the construction of a water-saving system. On the other hand, it controlled the total water resource consumption and increased the construction of water-saving infrastructure and the improvement of water-saving technologies. The water-saving measures taken by cities have achieved good results in line with SDG6.4: “Improve water efficiency to ensure sustainable water use ”. Due to the different geographical locations and production factors of the cities in the GUA, the WF also showed great differences. Weinan's WF was the largest at 7.71 billion m3  in 2018, and Xianyang also reached 7.62 billion m3 , accounting for 65.40% of the total WF. Weinan and Xianyang are located in the hinterland of the Guanzhong Plain, with superior agricultural production conditions and rich agricultural production resources. This position reflects Weinan's role as an important agricultural product base in China and the best agro-ecological zone in Shaanxi. The largest outputs of Shaanxi are grain, cotton and oilseeds. Agricultural production WF accounts for more than 90% of the total WF in Weinan. Xianyang has developed agriculture, complete industrial categories and rapid economic development. It is the largest agricultural city in Shaanxi and the country's largest production base for high-quality apples. Therefore, agricultural production has a higher demand for water resources. According to the comparison of the proportions of the GUA's WF accounts in 2007 and 2018 (Fig. 5  ), the agricultural production WF has always accounted for a relatively large proportion of the total WF. In 2018, the planting area for crops increased by 22,500 ha compared with 2007, and the output of crops also increased by 8,118,100 tons. The demand for agricultural production water is high, and the proportions in 2007 and 2018 were both over 90%. The industrial production WF dropped from 4.26% in 2007 to 3.66% in 2018, and industrial water consumption was well controlled. This is mainly due to the government's vigorous efforts to promote water-saving work in high-water-consumption industries and improve the water efficiency behaviour. In addition, industrial enterprises have also increased the number of high-tech enterprises with low water consumption by realizing the transformation of the industrial structure, improving industrial water-saving technology, and establishing water-saving measures in various production links. The proportion of the ecological environment WF increased by 1.41%, indicating the improvement of the urban water environment by the increased amount of ecological water supply in rivers, lakes, wetlands and the achievement of urban ecological balance, which is in line with SDG6.6. For example, Xi'an aims to improve the urban water environment and build a “green lung” in the city, and further open up the river and lake system. The Xi'an moat, which has a history of more than 600 years and surrounds the ancient city wall over a distance of 14.6 km, has been transformed into an important public recreation area. Chanba National Wetland Park, which is located at the confluence of the Bahe and Weihe rivers, now has a water area of 1.5 km2 . Historical sites such as Seoul Lake, Qujiang Pond, and Weiyang Lake have become not only famous scenic spots that are free and open but also one of the water sources for local residents' water use and daily life, increasing the urban landscape water surface from 180,000 m2  to 362,000 m2 . The decline in the proportion of the water consumption in the daily life of residents indicates that the public's awareness of the importance of water conservation is gradually increasing. The proportion of imported and exported virtual water has increased significantly, mainly due to changes in the virtual water volume of imports and exports in Xi'an. Due to the high degree of industrial agglomeration in the GUA, the cross-regional management of water resources is the key to achieving SDG6.5 in TUAs.  3.2 Changing characteristics of the sustainable use of water resources The reduction in the WPB based on the EPC method reflects the level of sustainable water use. The results showed that the WF of the GUA was greater than the WPB (Fig. 6  ) from 2007 to 2018, resulting in a water deficit. The water deficit increased from 5.61 billion m3  in 2007 to 14.29 billion m3  in 2010, with an increase of 154.57%, and the unsustainability of water resources increased. The Weihe River flows through Baoji, Xianyang, Xi'an, Weinan and other cities in the GUA. During this period, the discharge of industrial wastewater and domestic wastewater led to serious pollution in the Weihe River, undermined local water security and exacerbated problems related to water shortages. This is contrary to SDG6.4. The water deficit grew steadily, from 14.05 billion m3  to 16.52 billion m3 , an increase of 17.37% from 2011 to 2017. The water deficit dropped significantly by 35.75% from 2017 to 2018, highlighting the initial success of water pollutant reduction and control measures and ensuring the supply of water resources. In terms of the changes in the water deficit of each city (Fig. 7  ), Xianyang has the highest water deficit, followed by Weinan. The water deficits of Xianyang in 2016 and Weinan in 2017 reached the highest levels at 7.81 billion m3  and 5.31 billion m3 , respectively. Xianyang has a considerable volume of transit water, which is difficult to use. The distributions of surface water and groundwater are unbalanced. The total amount of water resources in Weinan is insufficient, which makes it difficult to meet the needs of urban development. Xi'an had surpluses in 2007 and 2008 of 0.74 billion m3  and 0.09 billion m3 , respectively. However, the water deficit fluctuated from 2009 to 2015 and reached the highest level of 0.94 billion m3  in 2015. Xi'an is the only national central city in northwest China, where the per capita GDP reached 15,000 USD in 2020. Xi'an occupies only 25% of the land area of the GUA, but its total population exceeds 40% of the total population of the GUA, and its GDP exceeds 60% of that of the GUA. However, the per capita water resources of Xi'an are only 260 m3 , which is far lower than the internationally recognized minimum threshold of 500 m3 , which indicates that it is a typical water shortage city. To become a national water-saving city, Xi'an promoted its transition to a sponge city. Through ecological projects such as river restoration, wetlands, and moats, the existing wetland area has reached 40,000 ha, and degraded ecological functions have been gradually restored. The types and numbers of wild animal and plant resources have increased considerably. The water quality and ecological environment of the wetlands have been notably improved. Xi'an transformed its water deficit into a water surplus from 2016 to 2018. In 2017, the utilization of water resources was close to break even. Xi'an achieved a water surplus of 1.79 billion m3  in 2018 and had an improvement in water use efficiency.  3.3 Spatio-temporal evolution of the sustainable use of water resources 3.3.1 Spatial dimension The factors affecting the achievement of SDG6 in each city in a TUA differ, showing unbalanced characteristics (Fig. 8  ). The pressure subsystems of Tongchuan, Xianyang and Weinan have the highest weights, at 28.80%, 24.39% and 28.80%, respectively, indicating that the main factor affecting the ability of these cities to achieve SDG6 is the pressure of urban development. The weight of the urbanization rate and water consumption per ten thousand RMB of the GDP is the highest in the pressure subsystem. The urbanization rates of Tongchuan, Xianyang and Weinan increased by 13.84%, 33.86%, and 53.58% from 2007 to 2018, respectively, indicating that urban expansion and population agglomeration put pressure on the water resources. The decline in water consumption per ten thousand RMB of the GDP indicates that there is still room for improvement in water resource utilization. The weights of the response subsystems in Xi'an and Baoji are 33.79% and 25.84%, respectively. The forest coverage rate and water saving irrigation rate of Xi'an and Baoji have the highest weights in the response subsystem, with Xi'an being 37.08% and 33.46%, respectively, and Baoji being 39.67% and 18.63%, indicating that measures such as increasing forest coverage and water-saving irrigation can alleviate the pressure on water resources. In addition, in the driving subsystem of Xi'an, the change rate of the permanent population and the total permanent population have the highest intra-group weights, which are 33.25% and 29.92%, respectively. Xi'an is the only national central city in the western region, and its permanent population ranks first in the GUA. In 2018, the permanent population of Xi'an was 10 million persons, which was an increase of 1.698 million persons over 2007. The relatively high and increasing total population has caused serious pressure on the water resources in Xi'an. Among the pressure subsystem of Baoji, industrial production water consumption and the urbanization rate have the highest intra-group weights, which are 25.12% and 19.56% respectively. It is necessary to pay attention to the negative impact of industrial water consumption and accelerated urbanization on the sustainable development of water resources. The weight of Yangling's impact subsystem is 29.53%, indicating that the reduction in water resources and the decline in water quality have a certain impact on reducing the sustainable level of Yangling's water resources. In the response subsystem, the forest coverage rate and ecological environment water consumption have the highest intra-group weights, which are 39.29% and 38.37%, respectively. The intra-group weight of the change rate of the permanent population in the driving subsystem is the highest, at 62.22%, indicating that water resources in Yangling are available. These findings indicate that the sustainable development of water resources in Yangling cannot be separated from the increase in forest coverage and ecological environment water consumption, and the impact of population growth on water resources should also be prevented.  3.3.2 Temporal dimension The causal chain relationship (Fig. 9  ) between socio-economic activities and the water resource system differs, reflecting the differences in the ability of each city to achieve SDG6. The causal chain relationships in Xi'an and Baoji are “drive-pressure-state-impact-response-pressure-drive ” and “drive-pressure-state-impact-response-pressure ”. The weight of the response subsystem increased by 4.10% and 15.44%, respectively, reflecting the effectiveness of water resource governance measures taken in Xi'an and Baoji. Xi'an and Baoji have established themselves as “National Forest Cities” by building forest parks, promoting natural forest protection, returning farmland to forests, and creating key protected forests (Shaanxi Provincial People's Government, 2018 ). The forest coverage rate was above 30%, with outstanding results towards achieving SDG6.3, SDG6.4, and SDG6.6 from 2007 to 2018. The response subsystem of Xi'an has a positive impact on the drive subsystem and the pressure subsystem. The weight of the drive subsystem increased from 22.55% in 2007 to 39.66% in 2018, and the weight of the pressure subsystem decreased by 19.87%, indicating that Xi'an's response measures not only promoted its ability to achieve SDG6 but also relieved the pressure on water resources to a certain extent. The weight of Baoji's pressure subsystem dropped from 25.57% in 2007 to 22.38% in 2018. At the same time, the drive subsystem dropped from 21.15% to 16.93%. The response measures only eased the pressure on water resources and did not play a driving role in the social economy. To achieve SDG6.3, it has invested in comprehensive water environment management projects in key river basins for sewage collection and pipeline network construction, river treatment and wetland restoration in Baoji. The water resource pollution control and comprehensive river basin management capabilities have been greatly improved. However, the distribution of surface water resources in Baoji is not balanced. Governance measures have not fundamentally alleviated the contradiction between the spatial distribution of water resources and the development layout of Baoji. Both the Tongchuan and Yangling causality chain relationships are characterized by a “drive-pressure-state-impact-response ”. The weights of the pressure subsystems in Tongchuan and Yangling were 30.28% and 11.19% in 2018, respectively. Compared with Tongchuan, Yangling's water resources are driven by population growth and development, which generate less pressure than those in Tongchuan. The weight of Yangling's response subsystem increased from 4.44% in 2007 to 23.49% in 2018, and the wastewater treatment rate increased by 60.45%. According to the Environmental Quality Bulletin of the Yangling Demonstration Zone in 2018 , the improvement in urban water environment quality in Yangling ranked first in the province in 2018 (Management Committee of Yangling Agricultural High-tech Industry Demonstration Zone, 2019 ). The weight of Tongchuan's response subsystem first increased to the highest level of 26.87% in 2015 and then dropped to 16.33%, reflecting that the policies adopted by Tongchuan to help it achieve SDG6 need to be improved. The causal chains of Weinan and Xianyang are both “drive-pressure-state-impact ”, and the weight of the response subsystem decreased from 28.77% to 21.85% in 2007 to 7.65% and 6.96% in 2018, respectively. The response measures have had little effect on water environment governance. In terms of response measures, Weinan has built 6 industrial sewage treatment plants and 13 urban sewage treatment plants. The improvement in river water quality ranked second of all cities in the province in 2018 (Weinan Ecological Environment Bureau, 2019 ). The wastewater treatment rate in Xianyang has continuously improved. The results have been remarkable in achieving SDG6.3. Wastewater treatment plants and new technologies can eliminate pollutants and specific pathogens in wastewater (Singh, 2021 ). For example, the approach of nitrifying-enriched activated sludge can lower fouling and enhance the nitrification efficiency. In this way, the operating efficiency of the membrane bioreactor is improved, so that the water reuse applications can be applied to wastewater treatment (Sepehri and Sarrafzadeh, 2018 ). This can facilitate the recycling and reuse of water resources, ensure human health and the supply of water resources (Chen et al., 2020c ), and promote the realization of SDG6. The water-saving irrigation rate in Xianyang increased from 55.49% in 2007 to 68.08% in 2018, and the city was listed as a “National Water-saving Society Construction Demonstration Zone” (Xianyang People's Government, 2015 ), which is in line with SDG6.4.    4 Discussion The 17 SDGs provide a global strategic framework for pursuing social prosperity without compromising environmental sustainability, which is characterized by systemic complexity (Fu et al., 2019 ). Water quality assessment plays an important role in sustainable development research and has become a hot spot in environmental study (Zhang, 2019 ). In recent years, due to the dynamic complexity of the water resource system in the TUAs affected by many factors, SDG6 has become an important standard for comprehensively evaluating the degree of sustainable utilization of water resources from the perspective of water quality and water demand. Assessing urban water security is conducive to protecting water resources and contributing to the realization of SDG6 (Zhu and Chang, 2020 ), but the comparison of water security levels between cities in urban agglomerations exceeds the current study scope. It is possible to evaluate the impact of human activities on regional water resources by constructing a resource and environmental stress evaluation index system, but it is difficult to measure the sustainable level of water resource utilization (Ma et al., 2016 ). Even if the urban water resource utilization rate is evaluated (Ren et al., 2020 ), it does not accurately reflect the specific value of water demand. Although the assessment of the country's process of achieving SDG6 has just begun (Roy and Pramanick, 2019 ), the role played by regions below the national level cannot be ignored. Considering the context of the international community's response to the 17 SDGs, this study has carried out an evaluation of the TUAs' water resource utilization for the realization of SDG6. Firstly, the WF and the WPB were organically integrated as absolute environmental sustainability indicators of the ability to achieve SDG6. The footprint index can provide a reference for measuring the distance to the PBs (Matuštík and Kočí, 2021 ), and the WF is no longer limited to the assessment of water consumption (Vanham and Mekonnen, 2021 ). Scholars agree that the method published by the Water Footprint Network is appropriate for the evaluation of sustainable water resource utilization (D'Ambrosio et al., 2020 ). However, the analysis of the trade-off relationship between socio-economic and resource-environmental carrying capacities (Fu et al., 2020 ) does not take into account the spatial differences of regions, nor does it conduct dynamic spatio-temporal analysis based on the level of carrying capacity. This method has disadvantages such as its failure to consider the influencing factors and driving mechanisms (Wang et al., 2020 ), and it ignores the possible relationships with the bearing capacities of other regions (Chen et al., 2020a ), particularly the fact that virtual water trade exists. When a city's water resources are insufficient to support development, it will consume other cities' water. Specifically, water-poor regions address water shortages by importing water-intensive products from water-rich regions (Caro et al., 2021 ). Therefore, it is necessary to re-examine the carrying capacity of natural capital. PBs set boundaries based on the stability of the earth's ecosystem and on a conservative assessment of the effective prevention of ecological problems, providing a new perspective for evaluating resource and environmental carrying capacity (Chen et al., 2020a ). This study employs the WF to measure the amount of water resources used in urban agglomerations, employing the WPB as the threshold. By narrowing the WPB to establish a framework for water resource sustainability evaluation, the analysis shows the extent to which the water resource system of the TUAs is disturbed by human activities and determines the progress made in achieving SDG6. Moreover, the WPB is narrowed by the EPC method such that it can be applied to the sustainability assessment of water resources in urban agglomerations. The PBs framework is applied for absolute environmental sustainability assessment. The assessment of environmental sustainability based on the share of water resources that can be safely allocated forms the basis of this study (Ryberg et al., 2020 ). After the PBs framework was proposed based on the perspective of the “Earth System View”, the global impact of the chain reaction of environmental degradation was not apparent. It has be considered perfecting or redefining the PBs at a regional scale to improve their capacity to guide environmental policies. This study proposes that water shortage in urban agglomerations is a local problem. Global biophysical information needs to be converted into information related to urban agglomerations’ activities. Narrowing global boundaries in space can reflect the differences in the availability of water resources. Furthermore, the DPSIR framework is developed to analyse the spatio-temporal differences in the ability of the TUAs to achieve SDG6. The DPSIR framework evaluates the factors affecting the sustainability of water resources and determines the causal relationship between water resource systems and urban activities. The inequality in the allocation of natural resources, including water resources, will affect the level of sustainable use of resources. Discussions on the optimal allocation of resources within the PBs are attracting attention (Pozo et al., 2020 ), but the necessary premise is to conduct in-depth discussions on the factors that drive inequality in resource allocation. Applying the principle of fair quotas to sustainability assessment may lead to uncertainty in the selection of socio-economic indicators (Chen et al., 2020b ). Therefore, it is necessary to use the DPSIR framework to assess the complex dynamic relationship between socio-economic activities and the sustainable use of water resources (Apostolaki et al., 2019 ). Existing research has paid attention to the driving effect of resource utilization on socio-economic development (Jing and Wang, 2020 ), reflecting the socio-economic pressure brought by the decline in resource utilization efficiency and environmental pollution. However, it cannot explain the degree of change in resource utilization caused by social and economic development. There are also studies using the PSR framework to assess the sustainability of urban water resources (Wang et al., 2019 ). However, these studies ignore the differences in urban spaces and the connections between cities and do not consider the impact of different levels of sustainable water use on the coordinated development of urban agglomerations. From the perspective of coordinating interest relations, the sustainable use of water resources can be achieved by optimizing the distribution policies of stakeholders such as the agricultural sector, industrial sector, and households (Cansino-Loeza and Ponce-Ortega, 2020 ). From the perspective of the attributes of public water resources, the application of the DPSIR framework can reflect the level of water resource utilization in different regions (Kapetas et al., 2019 ), but it ignores the dynamic changes in the weight of each subsystem, which often have unexpected consequences for water management policies. This study develops a framework to assess the causal chain relationship between water resource utilization and human activities in the river basin towards the realization of SDG6 by using absolute environmental sustainability indicators. The sustainable utilization level of water resources is evaluated by describing the causal chain relationship of the DPSIR subsystem and the spatio-temporal evolution of the weights. The GUA in China is employed as the object in this case study, providing a scientific basis for formulating water management policies for the TUAs.  5 Conclusions and suggestions The population growth and industrial agglomeration effects of the TUAs have put severe pressure on the water resource environment. Achieving SDG6 within the safety operation boundary of water resources and narrowing the gap in the ability of cities to achieve SDG6 are the basis for the TUAs to meet the new water challenges. This study proposes possible paths by which the TUAs can achieve SDG6. It broadens the study and application fields of TUAs to achieve 17 SDGs and provides a scientific basis for local governments to formulate relevant policies. Based on the calculation of the WF of the GUA and each city in 2007–2018, the EPC method is used to narrow the WPB, and the dynamic change characteristics of the sustainability of the urban agglomeration's water resources are compared and analysed. The DPSIR framework is used to construct a water resource sustainable development assessment framework, and countermeasures and suggestions are put forward with the goal of accelerating the sustainable use of water resources in TUAs. The main conclusions of this study are summarized as follows: First, when the WF of TUAs is larger than the WPB, the water consumption exceeds the safe range of the water resource system, leading to a water deficit. The GUA in China is the subject of this case study. The results show that the total WF of the GUA from 2007 to 2018 showed the characteristic of rising first and then falling, and the proportion of the agricultural production WF was above 90%. The decrease in the proportion of the industrial production WF and the increase in the proportion of ecological water consumption indicate that the industrial water-saving measures in the GUA have achieved remarkable results, in line with SDG6.4. Weinan and Xianyang had the highest WF in 2018, at 7.71 billion m3  and 7.62 billion m3 , respectively. Second, the water deficit of the GUA is within the interval of [6.00 billion m3 , 23.00 billion m3 ], and the sustainability of water resources is poor. However, the water deficit dropped by 29.18% from 2017 to 2018, indicating that the GUA has been somewhat successful in achieving SDG6.4. Second, the “non-equilibrium ” characteristics of the factors that affect the ability of cities in TUAs to achieve SDG6 will create severe water pressure in urban agglomerations and thus will trigger a new water crisis. The results of the DPSIR subsystem weights show that the pressure subsystems of Tongchuan, Xianyang, and Weinan have the highest weights, at 28.80%, 24.39%, and 28.80%, respectively. These subsystems are affected by changes in the urbanization rates and water consumption per ten thousand RMB of the GDP. The response subsystems of Xi'an and Baoji have the highest weights, at 33.79% and 25.84%, respectively. Forest coverage and the water-saving irrigation rate have the highest weights in the response subsystem group. Yangling's impact subsystem weight is 38.06%, and water pollution has a substantial impact on the ability to achieve SDG6. Finally, the interaction paths between the socio-economic activities and water resource systems of the cities in the GUA are obviously different. The causal chain relationship between these two factors also differs, resulting in different abilities of each city to achieve SDG6. The causal chain relationship for Xi'an and Baoji is “drive-pressure-state-impact-response-pressure-drive ” and “drive-pressure-state- impact-response-pressure ”, respectively. Those of Tongchuan and Yangling are “drive-pressure-state-impact-response ”, and those of Weinan and Xianyang are “drive-pressure-state-impact ”. According to the connotation of SDG6, the water consumption of the GUA exceeds the safety range of the local water resource system. The utilization rate of water resources still needs to be improved. The prevention and control of water pollution must be further improved. To this end, the following suggestions are made: First, the legal status of ecological water should be clarified. The distribution of ecological water should be considered in the allocation of water resources. Urban ecological restoration actions should be undertaken. River and lake protection and supervision mechanisms should be established, and an ecological water use scheduling pattern should be developed. A market-oriented and diversified cross-regional water resource compensation mechanism should be established. A profit distribution mechanism and rights-sharing mechanism that reflect the value of water should be developed. The development of water resources in specific water bodies should be strictly controlled through the issuance of water rights certificates. A strict sewage discharge policy and a strict water use system should be employed to enhance cross-regional law enforcement. Administrative efficiency and the credibility of water resource management should be strengthened. Second, the response mechanism of water resource management should be improved. Cities should be encouraged to take local action and employ localized strategies based on local conditions. According to the characteristics of urban development, substantive actions have been taken to promote the construction of sponge cities, such as the diversion and transformation of rain and sewage pipe networks, the ecological restoration of urban wetlands, green spaces and river banks, and the construction of green corridors in valley landscapes. Strictly controlling the development and utilization of water resources is the preferred localization strategy. Important water sources, wetlands, reservoirs and canals around the city should be included in the red line of ecological protection. Water resource utilization and disaster management can be incorporated into the development plans of urban agglomerations, and special agencies can be set up to conduct information research and judgment, emergency treatment, and command coordination of cross-domain environmental pollution incidents in urban agglomerations. An urban agglomeration water resource information exchange and sharing platform for the public and enterprises should be established, and the supervision mechanism for relevant stakeholders should be improved. The multiple cooperation mechanism can be actively used to formulate and implement unified ecological environmental protection actions through multi-channel and multi-level exchanges, promoting cross-border cooperation of urban water resources. Third, water-saving actions in industry and agriculture while focusing on increasing efficiency, reducing emissions and reducing losses should be coordinated. There should be a better focus on the promotion of water-saving technologies. The management and control of slaughtering, food processing and other industries should be strengthened, and pollutants in the dry season should be addressed. The operation and maintenance of sewage treatment facilities should be monitored. The price of recycled water should be reasonable to promote the secondary use of recycled water. This study also has certain limitations. First, the use of the EPC method to determine the WPB of urban agglomerations is not based on the characteristics of local water resources, which may affect judgments about the sustainable state of water resources. Second, because it is difficult to obtain input-output data for urban agglomerations, the virtual water volume of the trade between the cities in the GUA is not estimated in the calculation of the WF, which may affect the accuracy of the results. Third, when establishing the DPSIR framework to assess the spatio-temporal evolutionary characteristics of the sustainable use of water resources, there are incomplete limitations in the selection of indicators. Dynamic weather changes will have a direct impact on the river runoff in the basin (Guiamel and Lee, 2020 ). Although this study takes into account the use of the water production coefficient to indicate the impact of precipitation on the total amount of water resources, it is still necessary to add other meteorological indicators to better evaluate the water resource situation. Therefore, improving the adaptability of the measurement methods, improving the construction of evaluation systems, and evaluating the fairness of urban agglomeration water resource allocation and cross-regional water resource ecological compensation are future study directions.
