                  Sustainable development goals (SDGs) and fossil energy are the core elements of almost all major challenges and opportunities for achieving social development. Particularly, energy sustainability has become one of the pivotal drivers of China's economy. This study constructed a comprehensive evaluation index system for the provincial-level sustainable development of fossil energy in China covering three major dimensions (socio-economic, resource, and environmental). Moreover, a set of criteria for measuring the SDGs of fossil energy at the national level in China was developed. Based on the provincial panel data collected from 30 provinces from 2010 through 2019, a spatial econometric model was applied to empirically evaluate the effects of SDGs on fossil energy consumption. The results showed that the SDGs not only promote the reduction of fossil energy consumption with substantial negative spatial spillover effects, but also revealed differences between northern and southern China. To promote the early achievement of sustainable fossil energy development in China, the transformation and upgradation of fossil energy systems should be conducted early and inter-regional cooperation should be strengthened according to local conditions to jointly achieve the SDGs.

Graphical abstract       Sustainable development goals (SDGs) and fossil energy are the core elements of almost all major challenges and opportunities for achieving social development. Particularly, energy sustainability has become one of the pivotal drivers of China's economy. This study constructed a comprehensive evaluation index system for the provincial-level sustainable development of fossil energy in China covering three major dimensions (socio-economic, resource, and environmental). Moreover, a set of criteria for measuring the SDGs of fossil energy at the national level in China was developed. Based on the provincial panel data collected from 30 provinces from 2010 through 2019, a spatial econometric model was applied to empirically evaluate the effects of SDGs on fossil energy consumption. The results showed that the SDGs not only promote the reduction of fossil energy consumption with substantial negative spatial spillover effects, but also revealed differences between northern and southern China. To promote the early achievement of sustainable fossil energy development in China, the transformation and upgradation of fossil energy systems should be conducted early and inter-regional cooperation should be strengthened according to local conditions to jointly achieve the SDGs.   Keywords Sustainable development goals  Fossil energy consumption  Spatial Durbin model  Spillover effects    1 Introduction Achieving sustainable development along with fossil energy consumption is a common global concern. The requirement to achieve sustainable energy development through carbon reduction will benefit not only individual countries, but also global human survival and socio-economic development. Since the 1980s, global energy and resource consumption, along with worldwide environmental destruction, have become increasingly serious. Measures to achieve simultaneous sustainable socio-economic, energy, and environmental development have attracted global attention. Fossil energy has been the major driving force of global industrial and socio-economic development for the past century. The main fossil energy sources include coal, oil, and natural gas which supplies more than 80% of the world’s energy (EESI, 2023 ). Evaluating China's data for the past decade (Fig. 1  ), fossil energy accounts for the majority of total energy consumption. However, fossil fuels emit substantial amounts of greenhouse gases, which consequently leads to global warming and severe environmental damage (Cang et al., 2021; Wen et al., 2023 ). In response, China has made numerous plans for the transition to low-carbon fossil energy. During the 14th Five-Year Plan period, a green and low-carbon energy transition mechanism will promote the “double control” of energy consumption targeting the use of non-fossil energy. Most of the early studies related to fossil energy and SDGs measured the sustainability of fossil energy in several countries and proposed measures to achieve energy sustainability (Mohammadnejad et al., 2011; Ong et al., 2011; Hasan et al., 2012; Oyedepo, 2014 ). The theory of sustainability and the carrying capacity of fossil energy are mutually reinforcing. Conserving fossil energy in harmony with socio-economic development will promote sustainable development. Improving the sustainability of fossil energy is an effective approach to eventually achieving sustainable socio-economic development in China. Accordingly, focusing on the harmonious relationship between humans and nature and conducting research on fossil energy consumption and sustainable development are particularly important. The SDGs and visions established by the United Nations (UN) will assist in analyzing the logic and core objective of China’s policy on sustainable energy development and “carbon neutrality and carbon peaking”. In 2015, the UN adopted the “Transforming Our World − 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” and established a set of SDGs aimed at eradicating poverty, protecting the planet, and ensuring shared prosperity for all. Article 7 of the SDGs (SDG7) explicitly calls for ensuring affordable, reliable, and sustainable access to modern energy. To achieve an ecologically sound development path, China proposed the implementation of a sustainable development strategy in 1995 and later set a carbon–neutral target for 2020 to efficiently manage the connection among the economy, resources, and environment, as well as promote harmonious coexistence between humans and nature. By 2030, China will establish a basic system with policies in place for green and low-carbon energy development in the field of energy consumption. By that time, non-fossil energy will replace fossil energy on a large scale to meet energy demand, energy production and consumption patterns will be comprehensively improved to protect energy security. These policies will align with SDGs established by the UN and be developed to address environmental pollution caused by fossil energy consumption to balance sustainable economic development. However, SDGs are a universal agenda and a holistic development strategy for global sustainable development is needed. The existing literature on SDGs is not only limited to progress on global and regional sustainable development, but also there are few studies that develop fossil energy-related SDGs. Establishing a localized, quantifiable, and monitorable indicator system to achieve sustainable fossil fuel energy development in China is the most effective approach to provide scientific and effective policy guidance to manage China’s fossil energy sector. This study aims to develop standards for a comprehensive evaluation system for the sustainable development of fossil energy based on the 2030 SDG indicators addressing socio-economic, resources, and environmental dimensions at the inter-provincial level in China. The study makes three contributions to the existing literature. First, this study aimed to frame a comprehensive evaluation index system for the sustainable development of fossil energy in China at the inter-provincial level, covering socio-economic, resource, and environmental dimensions. Second, the study uses a spatial measurement model to explore the relationship between fossil energy consumption and SDGs using China’s 2010–2019 provincial data as the research sample to analyze spatial spillover effects of SDGs on fossil energy consumption in China’s fossil energy sector. Finally, suggestions are given in view of the conclusions, to achieve China's sustainable fossil energy development goals as soon as possible.  2 Literature review Most studies on energy and sustainable development discuss whether the combined use of fossil and renewable energy sources can achieve sustainable development (Londono-Pulgarin et al., 2021 ). Kirikkaleli and Adebayo (2020)  empirically concluded that renewable energy consumption has a vital and lasting positive impact on environmental sustainability worldwide. Abbasi et al. (2022)  argued that renewable energy is essential for achieving sustainable environmental goals and reducing the use of fossil energy in the energy portfolio. The gradual replacement of fossil energy by biomass, renewable, and green energy sources is an inevitable trend in the development of the energy economy (Asghar et al., 2023 ). However, the energy systems of most countries use fossil fuels, regardless of their developmental level (Sugiawan and Managi, 2019 ). In such scenarios, scholars have focused on achieving a balance between fossil and renewable energy consumption and understanding how sustainable development can be achieved by controlling economic transformation, environmental regulation, and green technology advancements (Guzović et al., 2022 ). However, the specific impacts of sustainable development on fossil energy consumption after its promulgation have not been focused upon in most studies. Therefore, the construction of fossil energy sustainability indicators and exploration of how they contribute to fossil energy is crucial. Most of the existing literature evaluates the performance of the environmental carrying capacity of natural resources, such as land (Mengesha et al., 2022 ), water (Cheng et al., 2023 ), and forests (Song et al., 2022 ) to understand how to efficiently conserve and use environmental resources according to SDGs, but research on mineral resources, such as fossil fuels, is lacking. In recent years, most studies on fossil energy have focused on developing fossil energy indicators, structural projections, and outlook analyses within the framework of SDGs. Several scholars have defined and formulated energy sustainability indicators, systematically analyzed their strengths and weaknesses, and developed a roadmap for sustainable energy development to provide an action plan for sustainable development in energy policy. For example, Gunnarsdottir et al. (2020)  found that sustainable energy development is an integral part of SDGs which has become an influential international policy goal making it necessary to develop powerful and comprehensive indicators to ensure the balanced performance of “socio-economic, resource, and environmental” dimensions for sustainable development while monitoring the progress of sustainable energy development. Gunnarsdottir et al. (2022)  further suggested that progress in achievable sustainable energy development can be measured by formulating robust context-specific indicators based on energy requirements. A step-by-step approach must be considered for achieving a complicated global policy such as sustainable energy development. Moreover, scholars have made structural projections of fossil energy consumption based on sustainability indicators to measure progress toward policy goals to guide decision-making. Simsek et al. (2020)  forecast current global trends in the energy sector, technological trends in the fossil energy industry, and prospects for development up to 2035 using surveys and factor analysis. Zhao and Luo (2018)  established the connections among coal, oil, and natural gas consumption, economic growth, and carbon intensity in China. Using gross domestic product (GDP) and carbon intensity as independent variables, the future structure of energy consumption was forecasted based on a model of traditional fossil energy consumption. Evaluating the compatibility of energy, socio-economic, and environmental sustainability is essential to implement sustainable fossil energy development strategies. A balanced evaluation of the development of fossil energy sustainability can correct guidelines and policies formulated to ensure smooth implementation of China’s strategy for achieving the sustainable development of fossil energy and economic environment. Literature on sustainable fossil energy measures mentions the use of analytical methods, such as constructing economy-energy-environment (3E) systems using principal component analysis, entropy value method, and ecological footprint (Huang et al., 2019; Ullah et al., 2021; Wen et al., 2023 ). Ma et al. (2018)  used the 3E system to study changes in eco-efficiency among different regions based on empirical analysis and the influencing factors in the Yangtze River Delta region from 2005 to 2015. Moreover, Cui et al. (2019)  used a vector autoregressive model to predict energy consumption and provide macro-level decision-making for the integrated balance and coordinated development of local 3E systems to promote resource-based economic restructuring and reforms to achieve sustainable development. The disincentive effects of SDGs on fossil energy have been rarely studied. Zakari et al. (2022)  used data development analysis to study the connection between SDGs and energy efficiency in 20 countries in the Asia-Pacific region from 2000 to 2018. The results of the empirical study indicate that there is a positive connection between sustainable economic development and energy efficiency. Fig. 2   shows the main elements of the literature review related to this paper. This study focuses on the SDG impact on fossil energy consumption. Specifically, a fossil energy sustainability assessment was developed integrating the three dimensions (socio-economic, resource, and environmental) based on specific SDG impacts on fossil energy consumption. Although some scholars have previously developed sustainability goals for fossil energy, the specific impact of the SDGs on fossil energy in China is yet to be measured. Therefore, this study constructs a spatial econometric model to measure fossil energy consumption and policy implementation effect. Measuring whether SDGs effectively control pollution caused by fossil energy and strengthening comparative studies at different spatiotemporal scales can assist in the formation of a spatial heterogeneity mechanism. Based on the empirical results of this study, corresponding policy recommendations are proposed to optimize the energy mix, promote low-carbon technology innovation, and facilitate sustainable energy development in China. Fig. 3   displays the mechanism.  3 Theoretical analysis and research hypotheses 3.1 Mechanisms underlying the impact of SDGs on fossil energy consumption The SDGs formulated by the UN in 2015 involve 17 goals, 169 sub-goals, and several indicators. Because the sub-indicators are extremely complicated, existing studies have selectively constructed evaluation systems of fossil energy indicators based on the perspective and focus of each study. Current evaluations of SDG indicators are still mainly based on socio-economic, resource, and environmental aspects. Focusing on SDGs from the perspective of operations research makes socio-economic aspects the objective function, while resources and environment become the corresponding constraints with the main idea being to achieve socio-economic national development while ensuring the consumption of resources and environment within the constraints. Based on real development experience, socio-economic development is often accompanied by an increase in fossil energy consumption, while the protection of resources and the environment inhibit economic development causing a dilemma. Most economic entities choose to sacrifice resources and the environment to achieve economic development. However, with the continuous breakthrough of new energy development technology, clean energy with higher costs but lower pollution gradually becomes the optimal solution. SDGs will reduce the proportion of fossil energy in the energy consumption structure by prompting economic requirements to increase the use of clean energy for improved environmental benefits. The new energy industry has more market space and economic vitality to promote social and economic development and will replace the traditional fossil energy industry which is stuck in a development bottleneck. This study proposes research hypothesis H1.H1: Energy SDGs have a clear disincentive for fossil energy consumption.    3.2 Spatial spillover effects of SDGs on fossil energy consumption The contextual fossil energy sustainable development indicator system based on SDGs in China is an overall system containing three subsystems with specific targets. Each subsystem is interlinked and interacts with the other. For the socio-economic subsystem, both spatial effects and regional responses of socio-economic factors, such as GDP, industrial structure level, urbanization level, and population density are supported by many theories with effective research results obtained through spatial measurement. The construction of roads, railways, and other infrastructure requires collaboration among neighboring regions. Creating socio-economic links may cause various places to be closely linked together which may lead to the consumption of fossil energy in the neighboring regions. For the energy subsystem, traditional energy resources dominated by coal, oil, and gas, and their distribution, production, consumption, energy efficiency, and usage all have spatial distribution characteristics. Many efficient energy projects, such as the “West-East Gas Transmission” and the “West-East Electricity Transmission,” illustrate the natural spatial nature of energy issues and the spatial spillover effects that occur when energy consumption is regulated. For the environmental subsystem, both environmental improvements and pollution emissions reflect the extent of fossil energy consumption, and efficient ecological protection and regional low pollution emissions indicate a reduction in fossil energy consumption of natural geographical factors. However, the adoption of environmental regulation is a more direct and specific approach to address socio-economic factors. If environmental regulation policies are enacted, local energy consumption will be regulated reducing fossil energy consumption in neighboring areas. For example, if energy consumption is controlled through environmental regulation gradually shifting from a “crude” to an “intensive” approach, then spatial agglomeration and spillover will exist to affect total emission and regional energy consumption SDGs on fossil energy consumption may have spillover effects on neighboring regions due to infrastructure, industrial transfer policies, and environmental regulation policies. Accordingly, research hypotheses H2 was proposed.H2: Energy SDGs have negative spillover effects on fossil energy consumption.     4 Study design and data description 4.1 Development of an evaluation indicator system While developing China’s inter-provincial fossil energy sustainable development indicator system, indicators closely related to the environmental carrying capacity of fossil energy were selected from the SDGs, considering China’s natural geographical conditions and economic development (Wang et al., 2022 ). SDG7 (affordable and clean energy) provides a specific indicator reference for sustainable development of fossil energy. However, the 3E system, environmental carrying capacity of fossil energy, and relevant literature on sustainable development according to the principle indicator selection SDG7 cannot directly evaluate the sustainable development capacity of fossil energy. Indicators that are closely related to the environmental carrying capacity of fossil energy are required: SDG12 (responsible consumption and production), SDG13 (climate action), and SDG15 (terrestrial biology) are directly related to achieving the environmental sustainability of fossil energy and the socio-economic indicators SDG8 (economic growth) and SDG11 (sustainable cities) have an indirect potential relationship. Table 1   shows the factors involved in the development of a sustainability assessment system for fossil energy that integrates socio-economic, resource, and environmental dimensions. Constructing indicators requires objectivity. To avoid the subjectivity of artificial weighting and consider the discrete nature of the indicators of the evaluation subject, this study adopted the entropy value method to calculate the indicator weights and measure the comprehensive evaluation index system of China’s inter-provincial sustainable development for fossil energy (Wen et al., 2023; Ying and Ying, 2023 ). The specific method was as follows: Step 1: The dimensionless indicators in the index system were processed by the standard method of extreme differences. To avoid invalidating the subsequent logarithmic processing, 0.0001 was added to the dimensionless result to obtain a non-negative value.(1) Z λ i j   = ( x λ i j   - x m i n   )  / ( x m a x   - x m i n   )  + 0.0001 ( Positive  indicators )     Z λ i j   = ( x m a x   - x λ i j   )  / ( x m a x   - x m i n   )  + 0.0001 ( Negative  indicators )             where “j ” denotes the total number of evaluation indicators; “i ” denotes the total number of evaluation objects; x  max     and   x  min     are the maximum and minimum values of different indicators “j ” among all evaluation objects; and Z  λ i j     and   x  λ i j     are the value of indicators “i ” after and before different dimensionless indicators. Step 2: The indicators were normalized.(2) P λ i j   = Z λ i j   / ∑ λ = 1  h  ∑ i = 1  m  Z λ i j        Step 3: The entropy value of each indicator was calculated.(3) E j  = - k ∑ λ = 1  h  ∑ i = 1  m  P λ i j   l n P λ i j        where k = - 1 / l n ( h × m )    and  h    indicates the total number of years. Step 4: The redundancy of the entropy values of each indicator was calculated.(4) D j  = 1 - E j       Step 5: The weights of each indicator were calculated.(5) W j  = D j  / ∑ j = 1  n  D j       Step 6: The composite indicator for each province was calculated for each year.(6) C λ i   = ∑ j = 1  n  W j  Z λ i j        Based on the complete consideration of socio-economic development, energy resource conditions, and environmental protection, this indicator established SDGs related to fossil energy by superimposing and comprehensively evaluating multiple factor indicators, guiding the fossil energy consumption decision-making system. Notably, only if the energy development and energy economy follow a new path of green and sustainable development can a new pattern of sustainable energy development be fully formed. Fig. 4   displays the nuclear density map of the ratio of fossil energy consumption to total energy consumption. Fossil energy share is decreasing with the right tail phenomenon of lengthening year by year, the distribution extension tendency expanding indicating that the spatial gap of national fossil energy consumption is gradually expanding. Fig. 4  also shows that there is a “club convergence effect”. Whether this effect is influenced by current policy, such as the reduction of total energy consumption in the early supply-side structural reform, or by the energy production and consumption revolution strategy, including the vigorous development of wind power and photovoltaic industry policies and fossil energy technology limitations. Overall, fossil energy consumption is decreasing with the SDGs projected to make a significant impact.  4.2 Spatial measurement model selection 4.2.1 Data description and descriptive statistics The research data were obtained from the China Statistical Yearbook, China Environmental Statistical Yearbook, China Energy Statistical Yearbook, and the University Financial Database. The data of 30 provinces (excluding Tibet, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan Province) were selected from 2010 to 2019.(1) Explained variable (fossil energy consumption, FEC): Fossil energy mainly includes coal, oil, and natural gas. Non-fossil energy consumption of each province was removed from the total energy consumption and the explanatory variable was expressed as (fossil energy consumption/total energy consumption).  (2) Explanatory variable (SDGs): Based on the inter-provincial sustainable development indicator system for fossil energy in China (see (1) above), the entropy value method was used to process the data and then used as a proxy for the explanatory variables.  (3) Control variables: To eliminate the interference of other factors on fossil energy consumption, road mileage (RM), research and development (R&D) expenditure, environmental regulation (ER), industrial structure (IS), per capita income (PGDP) and square per capita income (PDGP2) were selected as control variables based on previous studies (Du et al., 2021; Zhou and Du, 2021 ). RM was used as an indicator of infrastructure construction and was expressed as the total RM in each province. R&D expenditure was expressed as the logarithm of internal expenditure on research and experimental development. ER was used as an indicator of the intensity of ER and expressed as the ratio of the amount of investment completed in industrial pollution control to the industrial value added in each province. IS was expressed as the ratio of the tertiary sector value added to the real GDP with base per in 2000 as the base year. Considering that the explanatory variables were related to the Environmental Kuznets Curve, PGDP and PDGP2 were introduced to measure the economic development level and tested to ensure no co-linearity and autocorrelation between PGDP and the SDGs indicator system. The relevant variables are described in Table 2  .     4.2.2 Spatial weighting matrix settings According to the literature related to the first law of new economic geography, the spatial weight matrix can show the spatial location relationship of the study variables with shorter distances between the study variables indicating stronger spillover effects that decline with increasing distance. In this study, two types of spatial weight matrices, geographical and economic, were established to quantify the location of the variables and exclude the influence of previously determined weights on the regression results. Geographical weighting matrix setting: Weighting elements for regions i  and j W 1  = 1 / D ij    ∑ j = 1  N  1 / D ij        denotes RM between provinces i  and j  in district i . RM refers to road mileage between provincial capitals. Economic weighting matrix setting: Weighting elements for regions i  and j W 2  = 1 / G D P  i   ¯   - G D P  i   ¯      ∑ j = 1  N  1 / G D P  i   ¯   - G D P  i   ¯          denotes the average value of GDP for each year of region i  over the sample period. Moran's I test was applied to assess the spatial autocorrelation of fossil energy consumption in the 30 provinces during 2010–2019. According to the test results shown in Table 3  , at the 1% level, the geographical weight matrix Moran’s I value was significant as was the economic weight matrix in most years, indicating that fossil energy consumption showed some spatial correlation at the inter-provincial level, and that a significant spatial dependence existed between the fossil energy consumption of neighboring provinces. Moran’s I scatter plot was used to characterize the local spatial autocorrelation of fossil energy consumption in each province. As shown in Fig. 5  , the provinces are mainly located in the first and third quadrants reflecting the positive spatial autocorrelation of fossil energy consumption in China. The “club convergence effect” reveals that China’s fossil energy consumption exhibited similar spatial distribution characteristics in its neighboring regions, for example, provinces with more fossil energy consumption were spatially close to each other. Additionally, regions with more fossil energy consumption tended to be spatially concentrated consistent with the reality of China’s fossil energy being concentrated in the northern regions. When comparing Moran’s I maps of fossil energy consumption in China from 2010 to 2019, a small number of increased provinces were observed in the first quadrant, for example, a growing trend toward a “high-high” concentration of fossil energy consumption in China indicated an increasing trend in both the provinces and their neighbors. The spatial correlation in terms of economic distance was not as significant and tightly clustered as for the geographical weighting matrix suggesting that China should adjust its current policies to open economic and fossil energy exchange channels between the northern and southern regions to form a new pattern of joint development.  4.2.3 Spatial econometric model construction Fossil energy consumption in China’s provinces showed significant spatial clustering characteristics and was not randomly distributed. Accordingly, a spatial econometric model was constructed to investigate the effects of SDGs on fossil energy consumption while considering the influence of spatial factors. A series of spatial econometric model tests were conducted referring to Elhorst (2014)  and a spatial econometric model suitable for this study was selected. First, the LM test (Lagrange Multiplier) and robust LM test were used to identify the corresponding fit of the spatial error model (SEM), spatial autoregressive (SAR) model, and spatial Durbin model (SDM). The corresponding results are listed in Table 4   where the results of LM-error, LM-lag, RLM-error, and RLM-lag significantly rejected the original hypothesis that the model has spatially lagged terms of the explanatory variables and spatial error effects. Second, LR tests were conducted to further determine whether the SDM would degenerate into the SAR or the SEM. The LR results rejected the original hypothesis, the SDM did not degenerate. Finally, the Hausman test was used to determine whether random or fixed effects were selected, and all results were found to be significant at the 1% level. Therefore, the SDM based on double fixed effects was used as the benchmark model for the empirical study. These results are shown in Table 4 . The impacts of China’s SDGs on fossil energy consumption were identified using a double fixed effects SDM. The specific model was as follows:(7) FEC  i , t   = β  0   + β  1   ∑  j = 1  30   W  ij   · FEC  j , t   + β  2   SDGs  i , t   + β  3   ∑  j = 1  30   W  ij   · SDGs  j , t   + β  4   Control  i , t   + β  5   ∑  j = 1  30   W  ij   · Control  j , t   + μ  i , t   + γ  i , t   + ε  i , t       where FEC  i , t     denotes fossil energy consumption and is the level of SDGs measured, S D G s  i , t       denotes control variables, and C o n t r o l    refers to the existing studies to select RM, R&D, ER, IS, PGDP, and PGDP2, characteristic variables  W ij   · SDGs j , t   ,  W ij   · FEC j , t   ,  and  W ij   · Control j , t     , which denote the spatial lagging term separately, and β 0  ,  β 1  ,  β 2  ,  β 3  ,  β 4  ,    a n d   β 5     which are the coefficients of the corresponding explanatory variables respectively. Additionally, μ  i , t     and   γ  i , t     are individual random effects and time random effects, respectively, and ε  i , t     is a random variable. Table 5   presents the regressions using SDM, SAR model, and SEM. Columns (1) and (4) indicate that the SDM regression results for the SDGs and fossil energy consumption are negatively significant at the 1% level, indicating that the SDGs have negative inhibitory effects on fossil energy consumption verifying hypothesis H1. The coefficient of the spatial interaction term ρ was significantly negative indicating significant negative spillover effects of fossil energy consumption, a reduction in fossil energy consumption in the region reduced the fossil energy consumption in neighboring regions. Columns (2), (3), (5), and (6) show the SAR model and the SEM model results. The regression coefficients for SDGs and fossil energy consumption were all significantly negative at the 1% level again verifying hypothesis H1 and indicating that the empirical results were reliable. With the continuous increase in China’s economic development level, focusing on the harmonized development of the local area socio-economic, resource, and environmental protection is important given the special characteristics of fossil energy. Moreover, the relationship between SDGs and fossil energy consumption was closely related. China should make full use of the existing fossil energy resources while achieving economic development to continuously increase efforts to protect and improve the ecological environment and form a virtuous cycle where people and nature live in harmony which may assist China in achieving sustainable fossil energy consumption. To accurately determine the spatial spillover effects of sustainable development on fossil energy, the direct and spillover effects of SDGs in the SDM regression results were decomposed. The regression results shown in columns (1) and (4) of Table 6   show the main effects of SDGs on fossil energy consumption in the geographic weight matrix and economic weight matrix, respectively. The regression coefficient between SDGs and fossil energy consumption was negative at the 1% level indicating that SDGs can significantly suppress fossil energy consumption. Columns (2) and (5) show the spillover effects of SDGs on fossil energy consumption. The regression coefficients were significantly negative at the 10% level indicating that SDGs at the provincial level can significantly suppress fossil energy consumption in neighboring provinces resulting in negative spatial spillover effects and confirming hypothesis H2. Columns (3) and (6) show total effects which further supported the regression results. SDGs markedly curbed fossil energy consumption in the local provinces and neighboring provinces possibly because when implementing SDGs at the inter-provincial level, neighboring regions showed strong synergistic effects due to the existence of mutual demonstration facilitating the reduction of fossil energy consumption at the national level in China. While striving to achieve sustainable development of fossil energy, focus on protecting and restoring ecosystems, such as forests and wetlands, and curbing the decline of biological habitats and biodiversity is also necessary. Simultaneous improvement of fossil energy extraction efficiency, and use, the improvement of operational processes for the extraction of fossil energy resources causing environmental damage, the development of green and efficient fossil energy technologies, and the promotion of ecological civilization is also needed. The spatial spillover effects based on the geographic weight matrix (W1 ) were significantly stronger than the spatial spillover effects based on the economic weight matrix (W2 ) in regards to significance and coefficient values indicating that the spillover effects of SDGs on fossil energy consumption were stronger in geographically close areas than in economically linked areas. The spatial spillover effects based on the geographic weight matrix were mainly due to the greater impact of geographical accessibility compared to economic distance interactivity. This result was also consistent with the current scenario in China. While formulating fossil energy-related policies, it is important to not only enhance the spatial spread and spillover of sustainable development levels, but to also increase widespread policy implementation to avoid carbon emission “Free rider problem” making it difficult to effectively realize sustainable development of fossil energy in a comprehensive manner. In this study, the Qinling-Huaihe Line was used to divide the region for heterogeneity testing because the regional distribution of fossil energy in China is mainly characterized as “more in the north and less in the south”. As shown in Fig. 6  , the impact of the SDGs on fossil energy consumption varies greatly between northern and southern China owing to the differences in infrastructure development, technology, environmental regulations, industrial structure, energy systems, and economic development. The regions with more serious fossil energy consumption are Shanxi, Hebei, Liaoning, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Heilongjiang, and Xinjiang. However, through SDG policy guidance, it is obvious that the fossil energy consumption circle centered on Beijing is gradually shifting to the center of China. As the capital of China, Beijing is the political and cultural center, international communication center, and science and technology innovation center of the country attracting a large number of cultural, technological, and talent resources. However, this development also makes Beijing more crowded with serious pollution problems such as “haze”. Based on this, the Chinese government has clarified that any function that does not fall under the above positioning is a non-capital function of the industry that needs to be transferred to the outside world. Since 2014, government regulation has required thousands of general manufacturing companies using fossil energy in Beijing to close. This policy is similar to the role and purpose of the SDGs. Through related policy guidance, it is evident that the Beijing-centered fossil energy consumption circle is gradually shifting to central China. As shown in Table 7  , the regression coefficients of the main and spillover effects that were derived from the geographical weight matrix were −0.373395 and −2.406259, respectively, for northern China, whereas they were −0.559921 and −1.975120, respectively, for southern China. These coefficients were significant at the 5% level indicating that suppression effects of SDGs in neighboring regions on fossil energy consumption were significantly negative in terms of geographical distance and significant in terms of proximity. This result was probably due to the northern regions being relatively vast and sparsely populated, although rich in mineral resources but due to the lack of infrastructure and environmental protection system construction, resource-intensive industries still use a lot of fossil energy. Conversely, the southern regions were more densely populated, and most of the provinces are mainly light industries and have entered the post-industrialization stage, and the use of fossil energy has shown differences after the rational layout of resources. Based on the regression results of the economic weight matrix, the regions south of the Qinling and Huaihe Line showed negative main and spillover effects (−0.616088 and −2.445742, respectively) indicating that the implementation of sustainable development policies will reduce fossil energy consumption in local. It may be due to the higher level of industrial structure, relatively complete industrial chains and higher degree of industrial agglomeration in the South, where the sustainable development of the region affects the situation in neighboring regions. Unlike geographical distance, the main effects north of the Qinling and Huaihe Line were insignificant while the spillover effects were positive showing a 1 increase in SDG levels leading to a 1.409596 increase in the spillover effects. Reflecting that fossil energy will increase in neighboring areas, these results may be due to large differences in resource endowments, economic bases, and development stages. Additionally, fossil energy still dominates energy consumption in the northern regions because of large contradictions between sustainable development, fossil energy conservation, and carbon reduction in some areas. Particularly, coal-rich regions, such as Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, and Hebei, not only rely to a large extent on energy resources for their local economic development and livelihood, but also provide energy-intensive products to other provinces. Consequently, the spillover effects of fossil energy consumption in neighboring regions showed a positive trend. To inspect the reliability of the spatial econometric empirical results, this study used the methods of 1% tailoring and replacing control variables (ER2) to regress the model to determine robustness according to whether the coefficients and significant levels of the spatial interaction terms and associated variables changed significantly. In Table 8  , results are presented in columns (1) and (3) for 1% tailoring of the data. Tailoring is used to avoid the effects of data outliers. The replacement of control variables is used to evaluate whether the sign, coefficients, and significance occurrence of other variables will change. Replacing the control variable (ER2) method replaced the ER variable with respect to the ratio of the amount of industrial pollution control completed by provinces in comparison to the major operating cost of industrial enterprises in each province. The corresponding results are presented in columns (2) and (4) in Table 8 . For this test, the SDM model with double fixed effects was still used. Table 8  shows that the spatial spillover coefficients and direct and spillover effects were all significantly negative and that increase in the SDM indicator reduces fossil energy consumption in local and neighboring areas. The conclusions drawn from the baseline regressions and decomposition effects were robust and reliable indicating that an increased degree of sustainable development can significantly reduce energy use in the region and neighboring regions, which is a key factor in achieving harmonious development between energy economy and ecological environment.    5 Conclusions and insights This study used inter-provincial panel data from 30 Chinese provinces from 2010 to 2019 and constructed a comprehensive inter-provincial sustainable development evaluation index system for fossil energy in China. Additionally, SDM under a geospatial weight matrix and an economic spatial weight matrix was used to comparatively understand the effects of SDGs on fossil energy consumption. The direct, indirect, and total effects of the main explanatory variables were measured, and the southern and northern regions of China were divided along the Qinling and Huaihe Line to examine the differences in the impact of SDGs on fossil energy in the two regions. The results of the study indicated that: (1) Overall, the SDGs will have significant inhibitory effects on fossil energy consumption in the region and neighboring regions through two action mechanisms, main effects, and spatial spillover effects, where each 1 increase in the SDGs under the geographical weight matrix and economic weight matrix will lead to a 0.506097 and 0.435316 decrease in fossil energy consumption, respectively. The impact of SDGs on fossil energy consumption is more significant on the geographic weight matrix. (2) Considering spillover effects, the SDGs exhibited negative spillover effects on fossil energy consumption and these were stronger in geographically close regions compared to the economic distance link with a spillover coefficient of −2.239168. (3) Considering regional heterogeneity, the main effects and spillover effects in the case of the geographic weight matrix were both negative, unlike the case of geographical distance where the spillover effects were positive north of the Qinling and Huaihe Line. The results indicated that the SDGs contributed to the reduction of fossil energy consumption in China and that the negative spatial spillover effects were significant. All regions in China should strive to improve the sustainable development of fossil energy, actively promote the achievement of low-carbon emission reductions and develop and implement regionally differentiated policies. Therefore, to promote the early achievement of SDGs, China should accelerate the transformation of the current fossil energy consumption system to guide greater cooperation between regions based on local conditions. Based on the above analysis, the following insights emerge from this study. First, comprehensive planning should be implemented to ensure balanced and rational sustainable development. From an overall perspective, because China's fossil energy consumption has a strong “club convergence effect”, the control of fossil energy needs to be approached from a “holistic” perspective. Companies need to shift toward clean energy and reduce the use of fossil energy while adhering to the concept of simultaneous development and conservation. China’s government should encourage the development of high-tech and resource-intensive industries by guiding enterprises in technological innovation, popularizing industrial technologies, and making use of state-supported preferential policies to improve the enterprise sustainability. Relevant economic policies and environmental regulations are needed to achieve sustainable and coordinated development of the economy and the environment, as well as achieve the three goals of economic and social development, stable energy supply and demand, and environmental protection. Second, ensuring smooth channels are required to expand the radius of SDGs spillover. As SDGs have obvious inhibiting effects on fossil energy consumption in the surrounding neighboring provinces, the following two policy suggestions are given based on the spillover effects. Key developments can be implemented for railroads in provincial capitals and highways in central cities, relying on transportation arteries to close the geographical distance between regions and improve industrial structures and infrastructure construction levels to help achieve sustainable fossil energy development. At the same time, the transfer of pollution to other regions caused by industries with high pollution, high energy consumption, low capacity, and low technology using more fossil energy must be strictly limited to guide conditional regions in batches on the path to carbon reduction and sustainable development. Third, more focus on local adaptation and disaggregated policies to form a new pattern of joint development is needed. Because there are differences in the level of fossil energy consumption between northern and southern China, the SDGs for each region should be tailored to local conditions and targets should be set for satisfying overall requirements. According to the results of regional heterogeneity analysis, northern China has a weaker sustainable development capacity and more fossil energy reserves putting more pressure on reform. Therefore, southern China is encouraged to take the lead in achieving sustainable energy development, optimizing and upgrading the industrial structure, transforming the economic growth pattern, and playing a radiating role of economic distance. High-standard industrial transfer policies should be formulated to drive and help the northern regions achieve sustainable energy development as soon as possible, avoiding the “Free rider problem”. Sound market, cooperation, mutual assistance, and support mechanisms in northern and southern China can promote complementary advantages and the development of a common new pattern of sustainable energy.
