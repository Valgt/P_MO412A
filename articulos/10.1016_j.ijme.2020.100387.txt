The second Responsible Management Education (RME) Special Issue follows the PRME 10th Anniversary IJME Special Issue launched at the 2017 PRME Global Forum. This Special Issue was launched at the 5 th Responsible Management Education Research (RMER) Conference:  Responsible Leadership in Times of Transformation in November 2018 in Cologne, Germany. The idea of the RMER conferences developed in 2012, following the Rio+20 Earth Summit and PRME Global Forum which at that time had grown to over 600 signatories worldwide. Pioneering individuals had already foreseen the need to find a suitable organizational structure to accommodate this expansion by building a self-organizing ‘network of networks’. Core outcomes of the forum had been to inaugurate regional PRME chapters (with the founding of its first three PRME Chapters, i.e. the UK & Ireland, DACH (Germany/Austria/Switzerland), and Brazil and further enhance already established working groups in order to enhance bottom-up connection between members at local and regional levels, and to instil self-lead grassroots initiatives for RME. The idea to create a global community gathering for researchers in RME by connecting the DACH chapter (led by Lutz Schlange) with the PRME Working Group on Poverty (led by Milenko Gudić) resulted in the First International RME Research (RMER) conference in Chur in November 2014, entitled “The Future of Responsible Management Education ”. The event turned into a huge success, involving around 180 participants representing signatories and individuals from all corners of the PRME global network and beyond. While confirming the need of the RME community for staging outlets where delegates could present and discuss RME research issues, challenges and outputs, in order to explore how best to address the complex and interconnected issues related to sustainable development, the event created also an interest from other parts of the world to host future conferences. As a result, the initiators of the conference developed a model in which future events rotate between the DACH region and other regions where the members of the Anti-poverty WG are represented. Following this, the 2nd RMER conference on Inclusive Business  was held in Cairo, Egypt in 2015, while the topic of the 3rd RMER event, which took place in Krems, Austria in 2016 was Linking SDGs and RME at Universities . The general theme of the 4th RMER Conference, held in 2017 in Curitiba, Brazil was New Research Questions for RME and Advancement of the SDGs , while the 5th RMER event (led by Monika Kolb and René Schmidpeter) event that took place in Cologne, Germany in 2018 focused on the theme of Leadership Development for Advancing the Implementation of SDGs . The 5th RMER programme included PRME Working Groups and Chapters Activities as well as 42 accepted papers and 18 Open Engagement Workshops representing contributions from 20 countries across 5 continents. This highlights the international nature of the responsible management movement. A quarter of all contributions were set up in a co-creative and interactive manner to involve the whole community and enabled joint value creation. All contributions were organized along the following seven tracks; 1. Responsible Management Education for SDG 1 Poverty Alleviation, 2. Teaching on SDGs and Student's Views, 3. Leadership Development Papers & Roundtables, 4. Leadership Development Workshops, 5. Translating SDGs into Business and Educational Practice, 6. General Issues in Business Practice and Climate Change Education. This represented the strong orientation of the RME agenda to the SDG's. With a special focus on SDG 1 (No Poverty) and SDG 13 (Climate Action) which is also reflected by the PRME Working groups on Anti-Poverty (led by Milenko Gudić, Al Rosenbloom and Carole Parkes) and Climate Change & the Environment (led by Petra Molten-Hill and Alex Hope). The conference offered a highly interactive and collaborative atmosphere of like-minded people who share their passion for RME and want to develop students to create sustainable value for a globally inclusive economy and to take on responsibility. The conference connected a wide and international array of academic and practitioner communities to discuss and create ideas, share good practice, and present research outcomes in the area of Responsible Management Education. A strong element of the program was the inclusion of students presenting posters, open engagement workshops and a video contest called #PRME4us. Over 80 students in 26 submissions from nine countries addressed why RME is so important and how they think it should happen. This Special Issue was launched at the 5th Responsible Management Education Research (RMER) Conference in Cologne and as editors it has been good to see many of the papers that have come through the review process and are included here, reflect the growing interest and promising future for RME as an academic movement actively working to contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. The Special Issue is being brought together in early 2020, a decade away from 2030 but the agenda has never been more urgent. The coming years have been named as a Decade for Action by the UN and the RME community continue to commit to contributing to achieving the SDGs within their institutions, regions and working groups. The Special Issue consists of twenty-one papers and one comparative book review from authors located across the globe . The papers are organised into five sections: A. Fundamental challenges that call for a reorientation of mindsets to secure success of RME; B. Reports from RME practice that present creative approaches to future-oriented teaching and learning; C. Collaboration with external stakeholders extending the outreach of RME and creating societal impact; D. Methods and tools to facilitate institutional and systemic change towards the adoption of RME practices and E. Digital technologies create risks and opportunities for RME.A. Changing Mindsets for RME    Beyond Moral Righteousness: The Challenges of Non-Utilitarian Ethics, CSR and Sustainability Education (Ramboarisata and Gendron).  The authors call for a paradigm shift towards critical thinking in and beyond B-Schools and identify multi-level and multi-actor barriers to achieving this. Education for advancing the implementation of SDGs: A systematic approach (Avelar et al.)  The research identifies the role of Sustainable Development and the SDGs in educational contexts driving Responsible Management Education through an analysis of 193 articles in current literature. Capability Approach for Realising the SDGs through RME: The Case of UK Business School Academics (Nkeiruka Ndubuka and Rey-Marmonier).  The paper uses Sen's Capability Approach as a framework to underpin educational offerings in Responsible Management Education. Promoting the development of individual capabilities to empower a free choice of a quality life and to build sustainable patterns towards the SDGs. Governing Indifference in Social Performance Reporting (Thiel).  The article connects corporate governance regarding ESG (environmental, social and governance) financial performance with sustainability principles to inspire Responsible Management Education. It is argued that the introduction of socio-governance risk as an intangible asset in business valuation and a new strategic indicator for assessing, reporting and monitoring societal governance and social responsibility as an ESG theme in responsible investments and management education is a path forward. Paradigm Shift to Implement SDG 2 (End Hunger): A Humanistic Management Lens on the Education of Future Leaders (Hermann and Rundshagen).  The authors present current approaches to RME regarding SDG 2 (End Hunger) as dysfunctional. They argue that new paradigms of leadership (as well as leadership education) are required to more effectively impact on the implementation of SDG 2.B. Teaching and Learning Innovations for RME    Inside the borders but outside the box: An immersion program aligned with the PRME and the SDG to foster reflexivity(Wood Jr and Pansarella).  Field immersion in social projects by students (and educators) to connect with social realities in poor communities is evaluated as a method of fostering reflexivity. The authors advocate for the adoption of transdisciplinary programs of this type as a teaching strategy to educate reflexive future managers. Developing authentic leadership as a starting point to responsible management: A Canadian university case study (Corriveau)  The paper positions authentic leadership as important to education for sustainable development and RME and includes a detailed analysis of a master's level experiential learning course aimed at developing the skills required for authentic leadership including self-awareness. Social Media for Social Good: student engagement for the SDGs (Killian et al.)  This paper presents Skills development through service and experiential learning in the non-profit sector. It reflects on the evolution of an innovative, interdisciplinary module which engages undergraduate students with a range of non-profit actors, working in teams with the aim of developing and deploying business skills for social good. Other institutions are encouraged to replicate or develop this model further.Reporting on sustainable development with student inclusion (Herzner and Stucken)     The authors provide a mixed method case study on student involvement in university sustainability reporting as an approach to hands-on learning in a business ethics bachelors course. Student learning for sustainability through the WikiRate Student Engagement Project (Wersun et al.)

Stakeholder Orientation, Engagement & Inclusion for RME    Faculty Sensitization and Development to Enhance Responsible Management Education (Norman Arruda Filho).  Research conducted with participating teachers on the effectiveness of a project aimed at improving raising awareness and qualification of teaching faculty in themes transversal to technical education in order to disseminate the Principles of Responsible Management Education. Reducing carbon emissions in business through Responsible Management Education: Influence at the Micro-, Meso- and Macro-Levels (Molthan-Hill et al.) This paper explores how these different levels jointly help to work towards SDGs 7, 13 and 17 in addressing carbon reductions in a partnership setting between a business school and various organisations in the UK. External facilitators as ‘legitimizers’ in designing a master's program in sustainable business at a Swedish business school (Borglund et al.)  This article examines the role of industry as external facilitators in the design process of responsible management education (RME) study programme. Companies are positioned as instrumental to legitimizing the education, rather than being the ones seeking legitimacy. Driving Sustainable Banking in Nigeria through RME (Ijeoma Nwagwu)  This article focuses on ways business schools and management development institutions can through responsible management education drive learning for sustainable banking. It is set in the context of advancing progress towards the SDGs in Nigeria, a developing nation in sub-Saharan Africa. The Nexus of CSR, Creative Education, and Direct Democracy (Loose and Mohr).  This paper is concerned with notions of intergenerational equity and direct democracy in outlining youth visions, perceptions and suggested solutions for the future from the viewpoint of “options to save the earth step by step”. It advocates for creativity to be included at all levels of education from schools to University classrooms and from primary to tertiary education and beyond.D. Methods for Institutional and Systemic Change    Lessons in Sustainable Process Paradigm. A case study from Dubai (Pereseina et al.)  This article incorporates Sustainable Process Paradigm (SPP) in the context of Responsible Management Education implementation and utilises social network theory and sustainable learning to pursue desirable corporate and community outcomes. Morphological box for ESD – landmark for universities implementing education for sustainable development (Isenmann et al.)  The morphological box approach is presented as a powerful heuristic tool for creative problem solving, used to investigate the totality of realizations of multi-dimensional and non-quantifiable phenomena, like Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) implementation. State-of-the-Art practices being reported by the PRME Champions Group: A reference to advance Education for Sustainable Development (Reis de Assumpcao and Monzoni)  This paper analyses a selection of PRME Champions group schools practices and discusses the insights gained for RME as represented in the Schools Sharing Information (SIP) reports. Management of University Social Responsibility in Business Schools. An exploratory study (Wigmore Alvarez et al)  The paper examines the adoption of Social Responsibility (SR) in Universities in the Global Network for Advanced Management (GNAM) institutions. This paper explores how these business schools are integrating SR into their management systems and analyzes the potential influence of variables such as the school's size and/or geographical area.E. Technology Development as a Challenge for RME    Best Indycaster project: analyzing and understanding meaningful YouTube content, dialogue and commitment as part of Responsible Management Education (Schulz et al.)  This paper examines how the PRME principles are related to teaching approaches and discuss sustainable literacy and media literacy as linking factors to these principles. The authors offer advice on how other Universities may develop similar student led social media analysis projects to enrichen responsible management education. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Sustainable Development (Goralski and Tan)  The authors consider key questions related to managerial learning and leadership development to assess the impacts of AI on the realization of the SDGs. In doing so they analyze the impacts of AI in three case studies. Finally, the comparative book review - Tackling Doctoral Education in R esponsible  Management by Oliver Laasch  discusses two books. Firstly, The Ethical Professor (Eden, Lund Dean & Vaaler, 2018; Routledge) which illustrates how to be a role model responsible management academic across practices of research, teaching, and academic life. Secondly, Intellectual Shamans (Waddock, 2015; Cambridge) that provides actionable guidance for the practices of healing, connecting, and sensemaking, needed to change business schools, the economic system, and society at large. Laasch concludes that these books are well-positioned to serve as impactful educational materials for doctoral education that pursue RME learning goals. The success of the 5th RME Research Conference in Cologne annual event displayed the strength of the community, the personal relations between its members but also the welcoming attitude towards new followers and theopen mindset in working together on the SDGs. The most impactful contribution is probably the trust and the relationships that were build, renewed and improved which have an effect that by far exceeds the conference. The papers in this journal represent an excellent example of an impact of the conference and the community beyond. The 6th RME Research (RMER) Conference was organized in Jönköping, Sweden in October, 2019, with the general theme Multi-stakeholder Engagement for  Agenda 2030 and was an important global gathering of the RME community which continued the success of these events and demonstrated that the RMER conferences are accepted by the RME community and beyond as a unique platform ‘at the grassroots’ working level. This impressive success story will continue in the DACH region (Chur, October 2020) with the 8th RMER Conference, while the 9th RMER event will be held in Suzhou, China (2021), before going back to Austria in 2022, and further continuing its global journey including in North America, India, Portugal, and other countries that have shown their interest to host the event.
