Keywords Mining  Business strategy  Creating shared value  Sustainable development goals  Trust    1 Introduction and background In 2018, 250 mining executives from around the world were asked to identify the most significant risk their industry would face during 2019–2020. In a sector buffeted by the vagaries of the commodities market and faced with the challenges of finding commercially viable mineral deposits, as well as a host of other technical and operating risks, the forecast may be surprising. More than 50 percent of respondents predicted license to operate would be the number one risk to their business over the next two years (E&Y, 2018 ). The concept of a “social license to operate” (SLO) was introduced in 1997 by then-mining executive James Cooney in response to a growing demand on the sector to engage with communities and establish ongoing, positive relationships (Cooney, 2017 ). The launch of the SLO concept coincided with an initiative convened by leading mining companies called the Mining Metals and Sustainable Development (MMSD). The objective of the MMSD was to determine how the industry might improve its social, developmental, and environmental performance. Twenty years later the role the mineral extraction industry can – or should – play in sustainable development, as well as the criteria to earn a license to operate, remains complex. Mineral and metals produced from mining are critical components of goods and services used in society and are required to support the transition to a low carbon future (for example, lithium and copper for use in the production of electric cars, solar panels, and wind turbines). Yet serious and unresolved questions about the economic, environmental and social outcomes of mining remain. These concerns have contributed to increasing incidents of mining-community conflict (Hodge, 2014 ), a sense that mining cannot be trusted to act in the best interests of society, and the notion of social license as a business risk. A quick scan of Google news headlines tells the story of mining’s current reputation: tailing storage facility collapses; competition for scarce resources such as water; labour issues; environmental impacts; court cases and legal challenges for failure to respect indigenous rights and title. Not only do these stories appear in the media, they travel widely via social networks thereby eroding already low trust levels between the mining industry and society (Triscitti, 2013 ). Appreciating that mining provides many valuable materials that society depends upon, is there a way for mining to reduce conflict and earn sufficient trust to support more sustainable outcomes? Fifty percent of respondents to a trust survey conducted annually since 2001 stated that a reason trust in business is declining is a failure on the part of business to contribute to the greater good (Edelman, 2016 ). This finding seems to suggest that one way to build trust would be to align business with the values of society. In other words, to rebuild the social contract, defined here as an agreement for mutual benefit between an individual or group, the government or community, and the mining company. One avenue to rebuild trust in the mining sector may lie in the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Introduced in 2015, the 17 goals target the most pressing issues facing society. The SDGs were introduced less than three years ago, meaning there is little academic literature on the effectiveness of implementation strategies or how the global goals affect business. However, business leaders describe the opportunities inherent in the SDGs as ranging from improved economic performance and enhanced employee attraction and retention, to the creation of more than $12 trillion in growth opportunities (Business and Sustainable Development Commission, 2017 ). Mining, which has contributed to many of the problems the SDGs seek to address, is also favourably positioned to make a significant contribution to the achievement of many of the global goals (UNDP et al., 2016 ; Yakovleva et al., 2017 ; Chicksen et al., 2018 ). It has been noted that the SDGs are complex and ambitious, inter-related and inter-dependent, making it difficult to separate one from another. George et al. (2016)  warn that business alone cannot address the “grand challenges” embodied in the SDGs. Instead, collective, collaborative, and coordinated effort by public and private parties will be required to achieve the goals (Yakovleva et al., 2017 ). In this viewpoint piece, it is suggested that community relations, philanthropy, and corporate social responsibility, while necessary and important, will not be sufficient to drive progress on the problems embodied in the SDGs. For the mining sector to contribute to the ambitious agenda of the SDGs, business strategy to mobilize and share resources, expertise, and technology is required.  2 Business strategy to advance the SDGs Creating shared value (CSV), terminology introduced by Porter and Kramer (2011) , offers mining companies one potential business strategy. CSV establishes a framework for identifying opportunities to improve socio-economic outcomes and related core business performance (e.g., decreased operational costs, enhanced productivity, and/or a predictable and stable business environment). The objective of CSV is to find the points of intersection between the needs of business and society, then build collaborative partnerships to address complex social problems that are at the root of market failures — situations in which socio-economic conditions prevent conventional business models from succeeding (Kramer and Pfister, 2016 ). In the mining sector, points of intersection between what local communities need and what miners need to be successful are not hard to find. For example, both benefit from an educated workforce and healthy communities, both need access to water, both require energy and infrastructure. Each of these common needs map to one of the 17 SDGs: good health and well-being is SDG#3; access to water is SDG#6; affordable and clean energy is SDG#7; infrastructure is SDG#9. And, perhaps most important, SDG #17 is partnerships, which is a core CSV criterion. Mining companies looking to employ the CSV strategy to advance the SDGs are advised to embed CSV enterprise-wide, rather than having it owned by a single department, such as community relations or an individual mine site. Building a multi-disciplinary team, ideally incorporating external feedback, will help to identify and understand the social need(s) that the company is well placed to address. To earn internal support, critical for the success of business strategy, CSV champions will need to state with clarity how business operations will be improved by investing to address the selected social issue. Examples of business benefits might include reduced labour costs, improved supply chain efficiencies, or reduced non-technical risk. Local procurement is another avenue to more sustainable outcomes and a potential means to tackle a phenomena known as the “resource curse” (Geipel, 2017 ; Xing et al., 2017 ). Equally important is collaboration with community stakeholders1  1 Stakeholders are defined as using Freeman’s (2010)  definition: any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization's objectives.   and external partners with expertise and complementary strengths. Collectively, this group will execute the strategy and measure the link between the social and business outcomes (the shared value). It is important to state that creating the shared value concept is not about redistributing value previously created, nor is it about personal values or beliefs (Porter and Kramer, 2011 ). Instead, CSV is about the development of a profitable business strategy with parallel goals: improving business performance while delivering tangible social benefits. As innovation is at the heart of CSV, it will be interesting to assess if new business models are required to support the effective execution of creating shared value strategies. There are challenges. Not all social issues or situations will be conducive to the CSV strategy. It is unlikely CSV will work in situations of polarized opposition, where stakeholders are unlikely to wish to join collaborative partnerships that benefit projects regarded as inherently unacceptable. CSV is also unlikely to be feasible in situations where there is a fundamental lack of trust. Furthermore, critics have suggested that CSV will create “win-win” projects in a sea of unresolved environmental and social problems (Crane et al., 2014 ). Proponents of the CSV approach stress that to be successful companies must be in legal and regulatory compliance (Porter and Kramer, 2011 ). Yet academic research suggests that non-compliance with government standards is a key problem of companies that operate in geopolitical contexts where governments either do not or cannot regulate effectively (Matten and Crane, 2005 ). Despite these barriers to success, there appears to be a significant opportunity for mining companies to employ a CSV strategy to deliver outcomes that support local stakeholders’ priorities and that advance the SDG agenda, which governments, development agencies, and NGOs have all agreed require urgent – and collaborative – action.  3 Mapping the creating shared value strategy to the SDGs To demonstrate the mining sector’s ability to work collaboratively with stakeholders to secure sustainable outcomes, four examples of creating shared value, mapped retrospectively to SDGs 3, 6 and 9 are offered. 3.1 SDG#3 good health and well being An early example of creating shared value from the mining sector comes from De Beers, the largest diamond-mining company in the world. In 2001, employees at Debswana, the joint venture between DeBeers and the Government of Botswana, participated in a voluntary HIV/AIDS study. The findings showed 35 percent of Debswana employees tested positive for HIV, yet De Beers suspected that the actual infection rate could be much higher and, recognizing the social cost, calculated the business costs (De Beers, 2005 ). Direct employee costs (such as absenteeism, lost productivity, medical costs, training, and replacement costs, plus the costs of HIV/AIDs management interventions, including treatment) were projected to equal one to two percent of gross payroll over a 14-year period (De Beers, 2005 ). Further, the cost to the company for each HIV positive employee was calculated to be between US$1200–3500/year over 10–14 years, with the cost of treatment estimated to average US$1500/person/year (De Beers, 2005 ). These calculations illustrated that the cost of inaction would far exceed the cost of treatment. This led to a decision to introduce the first comprehensive disease management program in southern Africa. In a 2005 case study De Beers is frank about its motives for funding the AIDs awareness program and anti-viral drugs.“De Beers has a large number of employees in sub-Saharan Africa and business interests in many countries threatened by the next wave of HIV infection. Thus, our strategic approach to HIV/AIDs is borne not only out of care and concern for our employees and the communities in which we operate, but also out of sound commercial consideration.” (p. 3)   For De Beers, there was a clear point of intersection between the needs of society and the needs of the company. Collaboration with health care providers, NGOs, and community organizations was a key in the innovative program undertaken to address a critical social and business issue.  3.2 SDG #3 good health and well being and SDG#9 industry innovation and infrastructure A more recent example of shared value is found in Ghana where the juxtaposition of another lethal disease and the presence of mining resulted in a program to combat malaria. AngloGold Ashanti initiated a malaria control program in southwest Ghana in 2005, when malaria infected approximately a third of its workforce. At that time, the company estimated it was losing 7500 workdays a month and spending $660,000 a year on treatment, and the local hospital was handling 6800 malaria cases a month, of which 2500 were mine employees (Jack, 2014 ). The company’s objective when it began work on an integrated control program was to reduce worker absentee rates by 50 percent over two years. Two years later, infection rates had decreased 72 percent. Nine years later, in 2014, the hospital treated fewer than 100 cases of malaria a month (Jack, 2014 ). Treatment costs also declined, resulting in annual cost savings to the company of around $600,000 (Shared Value Initiative, 2014 , p. 29). Once again there is a clear benefit to the company (reduced absenteeism and health insurance claims plus treatment cost savings) and to society (improved health). And for gold miners there is another important role the precious metal can play in the effort to eradicate malaria. Modern rapid diagnostic tests attach the malaria antibody to gold nanoparticles during manufacturing. When the test is administered, the nanoparticle attracts any malaria antigens in a blood sample, delivering a positive readout on the diagnostic device. This innovation makes gold an essential element in a rapid diagnosis of those infected with malaria, and through interdisciplinary collaboration new applications for gold are being found for diagnostics of other illness, such as dysentery (Jack, 2014 ).  3.3 SDG#6 clean water and sanitation & SDG#9 industry, innovation and infrastructure When operators of the Cerro Verde copper mine in Arequipa, Peru began planning for a mine expansion, a key consideration was how to access the volume of additional water that would be required. As the mine is located in an area of water scarcity, securing access to the water required for mining operations was recognized as both a fundamental operations requirement and potential social and business risk. Traditional options, including increasing fresh water withdrawals, accessing ground water, and building a desalination plant were considered. However, following a period of consultation with regional officials, government representatives, civil society groups and water authorities, a decision was made to invest in wastewater treatment infrastructure. At the time, less than 10 percent of the city of Arequipa’s municipal wastewater was being treated, with the remainder discharged directly to the river that serves as the principal water source for the region. In exchange for the mine undertaking to build a wastewater treatment plant and operate it in collaboration with the local water utility, it was agreed the mine would receive a guaranteed volume of treated wastewater for use in mining operations. The wastewater treatment plant began operations at the end of 2015 and today more than 95 percent of Arequipa’s municipal sewage is treated. The treated water not used in Cerro Verde’s mining operations is returned to Rio Chili, helping to rehabilitate this important regional resource (Fraser, 2018 ). By working collaboratively with water stakeholders, an opportunity that met both a business and a social need was identified. Finding this point of intersection enabled Cerro Verde to create shared value. The company secured water for mining without the conflict that can result from competition for a scarce resource. The social benefit was equally positive: sewage treatment in the city reduced fecal coliform counts, which in turn reduced incidents of waterborne illness and improved agricultural outcomes.  3.4 SDG#6 access to clean water and sanitation Each of the previous examples was undertaken by mining companies with a source of revenue from operations. But it is also possible to employ CSV approaches earlier in the mine life cycle? The final example comes from Mongolia where a Canadian company, Erdene Resource Development Corporation, is working to advance a high grade, near surface gold discovery (Bayan Khundii) towards mine development. The project is located in the southwest Gobi Desert. About 90 km northeast of the Bayan Khundii exploration camp is the community of Shinejinst. Home to a seasonal population of about 2500, Shinejinst was built in an area of the desert with no local source of potable water. Until 2017, potable water was trucked into the town from the regional capital approximately 270 km north. Due to Erdene’s stakeholder engagement efforts, company personnel were aware of the town’s interest in improving its access to potable water. In 2017, when Erdene commissioned hydrogeological work to source a water supply for the potential mine at Bayan Khundii, the company offered to expand the area for the water investigation to include Shinejinst. This led to the discovery of a potable water source three kilometres from the town centre. Local municipal officials and Erdene personnel then worked together to drill the new water well that now provides drinking water to local residents in a much more cost effective and reliable manner than trucking it in. The project definitely advances the SDG agenda and also meets the criteria for CSV. There was both business and social value associated with expanding the area of hydrogeological investigation. It is worth noting that the cost to the company to expand the area of its hydrogeological search was marginal, while results delivered significant value to the local population as well as to the company, which found a separate source of water of suitable quality and quantity for the proposed mine (Fraser et al., 2018 ).   4 Conclusions The UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals appear to offer the mining industry an opportunity to realign industry interests with those of society. The SDGs are ambitious and there is no prescribed strategy for their achievement. With the deadline for the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals looming, there is a pressing need to determine how to transform mineral extraction to deliver clear benefits to communities that host mineral resources (Yakovleva et al., 2017 ). In this viewpoint piece, it is suggested that “creating shared value” offers a business strategy for mining companies seeking to expand economic and social value and advance the SDGs. A mutual gains approach to driving business and social value is not a new concept. Yet mining companies have struggled to demonstrate that the industry is capable of making a positive contribution to society, beyond the metals and materials produced. This has led to increasing incidents of mining-community conflict in resource-rich countries around the world (Franks et al., 2014 ). And, while the causes of conflict can be complex and interwoven, it is suggested that a root cause is a dissatisfaction with the current model of resource extraction, which has failed to align with community visions (Franks, 2009 ) or to deliver long-term sustainable benefits (Dobbs et al., 2013 ). In the past, mining companies may have resisted becoming engaged in social problems, worried that they lacked the expertise to address these issues and concerned about the ability to manage expectations that may arise from their perceived “ownership” of the problem. The problems embodied in the UN SDGs are clearly not solely mining issues; some might say these issues are government responsibilities. Yet when mining companies pursue the SDGs in partnership with government, civil society and community representatives, the result should be greater, more widely shared prosperity.
