                  This study utilized an online social survey of the public in Japan and Taiwan to examine their willingness to learn about various energy and environmental policy issues, their willingness to participate in random-sampling-based citizen dialogues about such policies, their attitudes toward having these dialogues with others who hold different views, their attitudes toward collaboration-based moral foundations, and the boundaries of such collaborations. We measured the attitude toward dialogues with a scale that was previously developed for research on citizen dialogues in Japan. Furthermore, we measured the boundaries of the collaboration by referring to the trust questionnaire in the World Values Survey, and morality was measured using the Morality-as-Cooperation Questionnaire (MAC-Q). Lastly, we statistically analyzed the relationships between these variables and found that Taiwanese respondents had a stronger willingness to learn about environmental issues and participate in citizen dialogue, a more positive attitude toward having dialogues, and a broader boundary of collaboration than among Japanese respondents, as measured by trust ratios. The perceptional attributes that led to significantly lower trust ratios were educational level, profession, and economic level for the Japanese respondents, but were religion, political orientation, and economic level for the Taiwanese respondents. Finally, the openness implied by the attitude toward having dialogues and the boundaries of the collaborations measured by trust was positively associated with the willingness to participate in citizen dialogues on energy and environmental policy in both Japan and Taiwan, with specific characteristics for each society, such as speaking in Japan and listening in Taiwan.

This study utilized an online social survey of the public in Japan and Taiwan to examine their willingness to learn about various energy and environmental policy issues, their willingness to participate in random-sampling-based citizen dialogues about such policies, their attitudes toward having these dialogues with others who hold different views, their attitudes toward collaboration-based moral foundations, and the boundaries of such collaborations. We measured the attitude toward dialogues with a scale that was previously developed for research on citizen dialogues in Japan. Furthermore, we measured the boundaries of the collaboration by referring to the trust questionnaire in the World Values Survey, and morality was measured using the Morality-as-Cooperation Questionnaire (MAC-Q). Lastly, we statistically analyzed the relationships between these variables and found that Taiwanese respondents had a stronger willingness to learn about environmental issues and participate in citizen dialogue, a more positive attitude toward having dialogues, and a broader boundary of collaboration than among Japanese respondents, as measured by trust ratios. The perceptional attributes that led to significantly lower trust ratios were educational level, profession, and economic level for the Japanese respondents, but were religion, political orientation, and economic level for the Taiwanese respondents. Finally, the openness implied by the attitude toward having dialogues and the boundaries of the collaborations measured by trust was positively associated with the willingness to participate in citizen dialogues on energy and environmental policy in both Japan and Taiwan, with specific characteristics for each society, such as speaking in Japan and listening in Taiwan.

For example, the Japanese government polled citizens on innovative energy and environmental strategies in 2012, during which 285 randomly invited citizens participated in small group deliberations, and volunteer citizen organizations, such as “Everyone’s Energy and Environment Conference” and the “Chubu Energy Citizen Committee,” held various dialogues concerning energy issues. Furthermore, a social survey conducted six years after the accident showed a willingness to learn about complex and sensitive environmental and energy-focused issues and a willingness to participate in random-sampling-based citizen dialogues throughout Japan, including in nuclear power plant hosting communities and large urban areas (Nakamura, 2019 ). This citizen participation in nuclear policy progress also expanded into Taiwan after the accident in Japan (Kim and Chung, 2018 ). The effect of citizen activities on national politics and the complex change of interest structure are considered to be conditions of policy transformation (Kim and Chung, 2018 ). The referenda were organized on nuclear power phase-out policy in 2018 and on restart of nuclear power plant in 2021, though the former one is still considered state-led (Huang et al., 2021a; The Atomic Age, 2021 ). 1.1 A culture of dialogue Despite the willingness of the public to learn about and act on these issues, international social surveys show that freedom of expression and self-expression are not as supported in Japan and Taiwan as they are in Western countries, such as English-speaking and Nordic countries (Inglehart and Welzel, 2010 ). The 2019 Democracy Index of The Economist Intelligence Unit, which assesses electoral institutions, government functionality, degree of political participation, and political culture, classified Japan and Taiwan as partial democracies (The Economist Intelligence Unit, 2020 ). Nurturing an attitude of listening and accepting different viewpoints with others and continuing dialogues with them is crucial to promote participatory environmental governance in societies biased toward authoritarianism and social order. Individual attitudes toward these dialogues are influenced by the distribution of individual attitudes in a social group, which may differ between Japan and Taiwan, but this requires further research to clarify.  1.2 Morality and boundary of collaboration Securing public openness and reducing exclusion in binding and legitimate citizen dialogues regarding public policy requires reasoning and self-evaluation of our feeling and value systems connected to these dialogues. Furthermore, we need to consider our level of open inclusiveness when policy content is disputed and establish those who we could have a dialogue with and collaborate with toward sustainable development. Moral foundations substantially dominate the feelings and ideas of individuals, which affects their policy judgement (Haidt, 2012; Greene, 2013 ); however, there is insufficient reasoning behind these feelings and ideas to reasonably make a conviction. Furthermore, the “boundaries of collaboration,” which determine the people with which others will collaborate, is a significant characteristic to consider under globalization (Chung and Mitsuyoshi, 2017 ). Less than half of the global population is estimated to have an appropriate order of consciousness or intelligence to lead them to collaborating with a larger range of people (Kegan, 1994; Kegan and Lahey, 2009 ); therefore, these boundaries of collaboration are not easily controlled. Despite these difficulties, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Covid-19 pandemic urge and promote public recognition of the connectedness between global and local (including national) populations and individuals. The boundaries of collaboration should be extended to pursue further collective developments toward sustainability. Historically, these boundaries have been either a collective representation (e.g., state and nation), sub-national divisions (e.g., moral tribes), or all human beings; however, how the state of these boundaries relate to trust, moral foundation, willingness to participate in citizen dialogue on energy and environmental policy, and attitudes toward such dialogues is yet to be elucidated.  1.3 Participatory environmental governance There are several studies on the possibility of participatory environmental governance in post-Fukushima Japan (e.g., Nakamura, 2019 ; Mah et al., 2021 ; Matsuo, 2022 ; Nakazawa and Tatsumi, 2022 ). For example, a series of social surveys revealed the moderate willingness of Japanese citizens to participate in a random-sampling citizen dialogue on energy and environmental policy as a nonconventional modality (Nakamura, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019 ). Moreover, an explorative case study of actual random-sampling citizen dialogues on radioactive waste disposal measured changes in attitudes toward dialogues among participating citizens, suggesting the possibility of promoting a culture of dialogue through appropriate dialogical space development (Nakamura et al., 2021 ). Nonetheless, the tendency to avoid self-expression, freedom of expression, and democracy in Japan compared with other countries (Inglehart and Welzel, 2010; Pew Research Center, 2015; The Economist Intelligence Unit, 2020 ) still requires attention to publicly decide and revise policies and rules under the presumption of confrontation and discrepancy of views among members of society, suggesting a nascent culture of dialogue in Japan. For instance, the Pew Research Center’s Global Attitudes Survey in 2015 showed that the indicator of support for free expression, which is measured on a scale from 0 to 8, in Japan (3.27) was similar to that of Russia (3.34), Turkey (3.28), and Indonesia (3.46), but lower than that of Germany (4.34), France (4.72), the UK (4.78), and the US (5.73). Taiwan has a similar culture of self-expression values, political and economic development, nuclear power utilization, and citizen attitudes toward policy process participation and dialogue; therefore, it is a useful comparison to help understand the culture of dialogue in Japan.  1.4 Feelings and value systems in collective decision-making Moreover, we must recognize the role of feelings and value systems in public decision-making, apart from reason, because of their significant influence on individual judgement (Haidt, 2012; Greene, 2013 ). For example, perceived climate change risk is explained by worldviews on whether equity is more important than social order instead of by scientific literacy and numeracy (Kahan et al., 2012 ). Since value-based group identities or moral tribes seem to outweigh rationality (Greene, 2013 ), the Morality-as-Cooperation Questionnaire (MAC-Q) (Curry et al., 2019 ) was recently developed to measure the moral foundations of a value system in the perceived settings of citizen participation in the policy process, particularly collaboration through citizen dialogue. Although the MAC-Q was developed from the viewpoint of cooperation, the boundaries of morality have not been specified and remain vague. Therefore, the current research explicitly develops a measurement for the boundaries of collaboration that is based on a questionnaire of general trust in people, which has been used in a series of World Values Surveys. By doing so, this study explores how the moral foundations and boundaries of collaboration relate to policy process participation and dialogue. This study used a social survey to clarify the (1) willingness to learn about issues of energy and environmental problems, (2) willingness to participate in random-sampling citizen dialogues, (3) attitude toward having dialogues with people who hold differing views, (4) collaboration-based moral foundations, and (5) the boundaries of collaboration measured by trust questionnaire, in Japan and Taiwan. The relationships between these variables were analyzed, as summarized in  Fig. 1 . Our empirical measurements of the culture and moral foundation around public dialogues, which focused on the feelings and value systems of the citizens, and our analysis of their relevance to policy process participation fill the gap in the literature on participatory environmental governance. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2  details the methods and data used in this study; Section 3  presents the results of the survey and analysis; Section 4  discusses the findings, including the similarities and differences between Japan and Taiwan; and Section 5  follows with our concluding remarks.   2 Methods 2.1 Survey To measure public attitudes toward dialogue and collaboration, we conducted online social surveys using registered people from internet survey companies, that is, Rakuten Insight Inc. for Japan and a company affiliated with Cross Marketing Inc. for Taiwan. There were 800 respondents from each area, whose ages ranged from 20 to 69 years old. The number of respondents from each area was geographically proportional to the population of residential prefectures in Japan and residential cities and prefectures in Taiwan; however, age and gender of the respondents were not allocated proportionately to the population to reduce allocation bias in the Internet survey (Hoshino, 2009 ). The percentage of female respondents was 43.8% in Japan and 42.6% in Taiwan. The percentages of respondents in their 20 s, 30 s, 40 s, 50 s, and 60 s in Japan were 9.4%, 20.0%, 29.0%, 26.4%, and 15.3%, respectively, while those in Taiwan were 27.0%, 32.1%, 26.9%, 11.1%, and 2.9%, respectively. Japanese respondents in their 50 s were more represented, whereas Taiwanese respondents in their 20 s and 30 s were more represented. The surveys were conducted in September 2021 and November 2022 in Japan and Taiwan, respectively. The same question items were used for Japan and Taiwan, except for the threshold values of five-point household income levels.  2.2 Willingness to learn about energy and environmental policy issues To measure the willingness of citizens to learn about various aspects of energy and environmental policy, the 14 topics shown in Appendix 1 were used in reference to the study of public deliberation on the energy and environmental strategy in Japan after the Great East Japan Earthquake, following a previous survey (Nakamura, 2018 ). The willingness to learn was measured on a four-point scale: “I do not want to know”; “I do not want to know, mostly”; “I want to know, mostly”; and “I want to know (I know).”  2.3 Willingness to participate in citizen dialogue The willingness to participate in random sampling-based citizen dialogues regarding energy and environmental policy was measured at two levels: prefectural (Japan) or city/prefectural (Taiwan), and national (Japan or Taiwan). The citizen dialogue workshops were explained as follows, following a previous study (Nakamura, 2018 ): “The workshop will be held on the condition that participants express their views honestly, listen carefully to others’ views without denying them, and that participants need not reach conclusions and agreements so they can still talk to each other and exchange different ideas, if not accepting them.” The willingness to participate in these dialogues was measured using a three-point. scale: “I would probably not participate,” “I might participate,” and “I would like to participate.” Furthermore, participants were asked about their level of hesitation in talking with and listening to others about nuclear power issues in their daily lives, which was measured using a four-point scale.  2.4 Attitude toward dialogue To measure an attitude toward dialogue, the distribution of which indicates the culture of dialogue in a society, the ability of listening to and talking with others holding different views were asked following a previous study, which used these in a citizen dialogue (Nakamura et al., 2021 ): “Listening to others with a view different from mine, regarding social, national, or local issues, without rejecting it, if not accepting it,” and “Conveying my own ideas to others who may have different ideas from mine regarding social, national, or local issues.” The attitude was measured on a five-point scale: “Difficult,” “Somewhat difficult,” “Hard to say,” “Somewhat possible,” and “Possible.”  2.5 Moral foundation MAC-Q, which was proposed by Curry et al. (2019) , was used to measure the moral foundation of cooperation. Our questionnaire included 21 questions on moral relevance and 21 questions on moral judgement, centered on seven moral domains, that is, family, group, reciprocity, heroism, deference, fairness, and property (see Appendix 2 for the complete list of MAC-Q questions). For the relevance questions, respondents were asked, “When you decide whether something is right or wrong, to what extent are the following considerations relevant to your thinking? (0–100; not at all relevant, not very relevant, slightly relevant, somewhat relevant, very relevant, extremely relevant),” while in judgement questions, they were asked, “To what extent do you agree with the following statements? (0–100; strongly disagree, disagree, neither agree nor disagree, agree, strongly agree).” An example of a relevance question regarding family was: “Whether or not someone acted to protect their family,” while an example of a judgement question regarding family was: “People should be willing to do anything to help a member of their family.” Although an animated slider on a visual analog scale (0−100) was used in the original MAC-Q online survey, the respondents were asked to answer with an integer between 0 and 100 in our survey. The average scores for the seven morality domains for both relevance and judgement (14 scores in total) were calculated for each respondent.  2.6 Boundary of collaboration Regarding the boundaries of collaboration, the scale of general trust in people used in the World Values Survey (WVS) was used in the current study as a reference: “Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you need to be very careful in dealing with people?” (Haerpfer et al., 2022 ). A respondent was asked to choose one of the following answers: “Most people can be trusted,” “Need to be very careful,” and “Don’t know.” To measure the boundary of trust as a basis of collaboration, we asked about general trust for the people considering 15 social attributes: (A) personal acquaintance, (B) same nationality without acquaintance, (C/D) same/different political orientation, (E/F) same/different economic level, (G/H) same/different professional industry of household income generator, (I/J) same/different religion, (K/L) same/different education level, (M/N) same/different nation/ethnicity, and (O) no attribution. In cases (C)–(O), it was assumed that the nationality of the person was unknown. A full list of questions regarding the boundaries of collaboration is provided in Appendix 3. For general trust (same as WVS) and each attribute-based trust, the trust ratio, that is, the number of respondents who chose “trust” divided by the sum of the number of respondents who chose “trust” and the number of respondents who chose “be careful,” was calculated for Japanese and Taiwanese respondents, respectively. The WVS has measured attribute-based trust since its 2010–2014 survey, using family, neighborhood, personal acquaintance, non-acquaintance, different religion, and different nationality as its attributes and a four-point scale for answers, that is, “Trust completely,” “Trust somewhat,” “Do not trust very much,” and “Do not trust at all.” We extended the attribute group categories to be more comprehensive, and used the same general trust questions for all attribute-trust questions to ensure comparability between the general and attribute-based trust answers.  2.7 Individual attributes and regression analysis Furthermore, individual attributes such as age, gender, working status (working more than two days a week or not), annual household income level (five-point scale), and education level (four-point scale) were asked. Concerns about climate change were also assessed using a five-point scale, as it is relevant to citizen dialogue on energy and environmental policies. We statistically analyzed the data obtained through our survey using regression analyses with either the binary logistic or ordinary least squares model to reveal the relationship between the measured attitudinal variables in Japan and Taiwan, respectively. The similarities and differences in the attitudinal distribution and relational patterns between the Japanese and Taiwanese respondents were clarified. The original questionnaire was prepared in Japanese and translated into traditional Chinese for a Taiwanese survey, and the original English version of the MAC-Q was translated into Japanese and Traditional Chinese.   3 Results 3.1 Willingness to know various issues of energy and environmental policy  Table 1  displays the percentages of the respondents who chose “Want to know” instead of “Don’t want to know,” “Don’t want to know, if any,” and “Want to know, if any,” regarding each of the 14 energy and environmental policy issues in Japan and Taiwan. Overall, approximately one-fourth of the Japanese respondents were willing to learn about various energy and environmental policy issues, while more than one-third of the Taiwanese respondents indicated a clear willingness to learn about these issues. Issues such as the effects on climate change, nuclear waste, power price impacts, renewable energy, safety of nuclear power, combined use of heat and power, and effects on the nuclear power plant hosting communities intrigued the strongest interests in both Japan and Taiwan, although the order differed slightly between the two countries. Compared to the Japanese respondents, who were most concerned about the impact of energy on climate change, the Taiwanese respondents were more concerned about the safety of nuclear energy production (i.e., risk management). After the Fukushima nuclear disaster, studies have found that the Taiwanese people became more aware of the risks of nuclear energy (Chen, 2014; Liang, 2014 ).  3.2 Willingness to participate in citizen dialogue  Table 2  summarizes the willingness of the respondents to participate in a random-sampling-based citizen dialogue on energy and environmental policies in Japan and Taiwan, based on the two examined levels: national and prefectural (Japan) and city/prefectural (Taiwan). Approximately one-third of the Japanese respondents showed a moderate or clear willingness to participate in citizen dialogue, whereas approximately 80% of the Taiwanese respondents indicated a moderate or clear willingness to participate. Notably, approximately 30% of the respondents presented an explicit willingness to participate in public deliberations on energy and environmental policy in Taiwan, which is similar to that of a survey by Hsu and Juang (2020)  on the willingness of the public to participate in governmental policy. The distribution of the willingness to participate in citizen dialogue did not differ by the administrative level of the dialogue for Japan or Taiwan.  3.3 Attitude toward dialogue  Table 3  presents the survey results regarding the attitudes toward listening and speaking to people with differing views on social issues in Japan and Taiwan. While the attitude toward these dialogues was either neutral or somewhat positive for most of the Japanese respondents, more than half of the Taiwanese respondents showed a positive attitude toward such dialogues. Although the attitude toward speaking was weaker than that toward listening in Japan, this difference between listening and speaking was not observed in Taiwan. Recently, the Taiwanese government has established activities and mechanisms, such as consensus conferences, scenario workshops, and online public policy participation platforms, to provide opportunities for the people of Taiwan to listen to and express their views on many public issues (Chen and Deng, 2007; Lin, 2009; Hu et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2021b; Ho, 2022; Ishida, 2022; Schoon et al., 2022 ). This may explain why Taiwanese people are more inclusive when listening to others and more positive when expressing their ideas.  3.4 Moral foundation The MAC-Q result subscales are shown in  Table 4 , with means and standard deviations (sd) for each subscale of relevance and judgement presented. Among the Japanese respondents, on average, family was more significant for both morality relevance (53.54) and judgement (55.49), whereas deference was less significant for moral relevance (30.71) and judgement (29.40). Moreover, property (83.55) and reciprocity (54.53) were significant in moral judgement but perceived as less relevant to morality. Among Taiwanese respondents, family (68.66/72.91), reciprocity (67.96/68.15), and heroism (60.96/67.42) were significant for moral relevance and judgement, while fairness (72.43) and property (75.80) were important for judgement. The subscale means in Taiwan were larger than those in Japan for all items, except for property regarding moral judgement. The difference between the subscales in Japan and Taiwan was particularly large for heroism for both relevance (26.69) and judgement (24.05).  3.5 Boundary of collaboration We measured general trust using questions used in the World Values Survey (WVS) and group attribute-based trust using 15 attribute-based questions to understand the boundaries of collaboration. For each of Japan and Taiwan, the trust ratio, that is, the number of respondents who chose “trust” divided by the sum of the number of respondents who chose “trust” and the number of respondents who chose “be careful,” excluding the number of the answer “don’t know,” was calculated for 16 variables.  Table 5  presents the trust ratios for different contexts in Japan and Taiwan. More than half of the Japanese and Taiwanese respondents expressed trust in their personal acquaintances. Respondents generally trusted people without any attribution less than personal acquaintances but more than an unknown person of the same nationality. Generally, a person without attributes, including nationality, was less trusted than an unknown person of the same nationality. The similarities and differences of the six perceptional group attributes, including educational level, professional industry, and economic level, led to slightly lower trust among the Japanese respondents compared to the other attributes (i.e., the differences in trust ratios were 0.062, 0.046, and 0.041, respectively). However, differences in religion, political orientation, and economic level led to lower trust among the Taiwanese respondents (i.e., the differences in trust ratios were 0.076, 0.071, and 0.066, respectively). Overall, Taiwanese respondents showed trust ratios that were more than double those of the Japanese respondents, except for trust in personal acquaintances.  3.6 Individual attributes, climate change, and nuclear issues  Table 6  presents distributions of individual attributes, such as working status, household income level, educational level, and interest in climate change and sensitivity to talk nuclear issues, among Japanese and Taiwanese respondents. These individual variables were used in regression analyses, along with age and gender.  3.7 Willingness to learn and discuss In this section, the results of the regression analyses between the willingness to learn about energy and environmental policy issues and the willingness to participate in random-sampling-based citizen dialogues on these issues are presented for Japan and Taiwan. A binary logit model was used, with the dependent variable being the dummy variable to choose either “I might participate” or “I would like to participate,” both at the national and sub-national levels. There were two models of willingness to learn about various issues as independent variables: Model 1 used the average score of the four-point scale for 14 issues, ranging from 1 to 4; Model 2 uses 14 dummy variables to choose “Want to know” for each issue. Other independent variables included individual attributes such as the female dummy, age, interest in climate change (five-point scale), hesitation to talk about nuclear power (four-point scale), working status dummy, household income level (five-point scale), and educational level (four-point scale). The absolute values of the correlation coefficients between the independent variables (maximum values of 0.817 for Japan and 0.512 for Taiwan) were less than 0.9. Overall, no multicollinearity was detected from these analyses. Likelihood ratio test was conducted to test goodness of fit of the model in population.   Tables 7 and 8  present the statistically significant results (at a 5% level) for Models 1 and 2, respectively. In both models, positive correlations between willingness to learn and willingness to participate in citizen dialogues were confirmed for Japan and Taiwan, regardless of the administrative level of dialogue. Moreover, interest in climate change was positively associated with a willingness to participate in both Japan and Taiwan. In Japan, female respondents showed a weaker willingness to participate in dialogues. Hesitation to discuss nuclear issues led to a weaker willingness to participate in citizen dialogues. In contrast, Taiwanese respondents with regular work showed a stronger willingness to participate in such dialogues.  3.8 Willingness to participate and attitude for dialogue, morality, and boundary of collaboration To understand the relationship between willingness to participate in random-sampling-based citizen dialogues on energy and environmental policy and attitudes toward dialogue, morality, and the boundaries of collaboration, we conducted a regression analysis using a binary logistic model. The dependent variable is the dummy variable to choose either “I might participate” or “I would like to participate.” Independent variables included two variables measuring attitude toward dialogue (i.e., listening and speaking; on a five-point scale), 14 morality variables (i.e., MAC-Q subscales; ranging from 0 to 100), seven dummy variables of trust to indicate the boundary of collaboration (i.e., general trust, trust in acquaintance, trust in an unknown person with the same nationality, trust in an unknown person regardless of nationality, trust in a person with three different group attributes), age, and female dummy variables. The three different group attributes were educational level, professional industry, and economic level for Japan, but were religion, political orientation, and economic level for Taiwan, since they showed a larger difference in trust ratio between the trust in the same group of people and that in different groups of people in Japan and Taiwan, respectively (Section 3.5 ). The absolute values of the correlation coefficients between the independent variables (maximum values of 0.874 and 0.755 for Japan and Taiwan, respectively) were less than 0.9. No multicollinearity was observed in this analysis. Likelihood ratio test was conducted to test goodness of fit of the model in population.  Table 9  presents the regression analysis results for the models with statistically significant coefficients (at a 5% level) among the two administrative levels of citizen dialogue in Japan and Taiwan. The results show that the relationship between willingness to participate in citizen energy and environmental policy dialogues and attitudes toward these dialogues, morality, and the boundaries of collaboration (i.e., trust) in Japan differs from that in Taiwan. A positive attitude toward speaking was associated with a stronger willingness to participate in citizen dialogues in Japan, where attitudes toward speaking were weaker than those were toward listening. In contrast, a positive attitude toward listening is associated with a stronger willingness to participate in citizen dialogues in Taiwan, where the attitude toward speaking was as positive as the attitude toward listening. Regarding a moral foundation, a stronger moral sense of the relevance of fairness led to a stronger willingness to participate in citizen dialogues in Japan. The moral sense of the group for judgement was associated with stronger participation, while the morality of heroism as a reference and the morality of fairness for judgement led to a weaker willingness to join citizen dialogues in Taiwan. To evaluate the boundaries of collaboration measured by trust, we found that trust in non-acquaintances with different educational levels, regardless of nationality, was associated with a stronger willingness to participate in citizen dialogues in Japan. Meanwhile, trust in non-acquaintances of different religions, regardless of nationality, or in non-acquaintance foreigners was associated with a stronger willingness to join citizen dialogues in Taiwan. Furthermore, gender affects willingness to participate in Japan, with female respondents showing a weaker willingness to participate in citizen dialogue; however, this is not observed in Taiwan. Finally, age was not correlated with willingness to participate in Japan or Taiwan.  3.9 Attitude for dialogue, morality, and boundary of collaboration In this section, the relationship between attitudes toward dialogue, morality, and the boundaries of collaboration, all of which were considered outside the intentional selection by individuals, was investigated through the ordinary least squares regression method. The dependent variables were two variables measuring attitudes toward dialogue regarding listening and speaking (five-point scale), and the independent variables included 14 morality variables (MAC-Q subscales; rescaled to 0–1), seven dummy variables of trust to indicate the boundary of collaboration (i.e., general trust, trust in acquaintances, trust in an unknown person with the same nationality, trust in an unknown person regardless of nationality, and trust in a person with three different group attributes), age, and a female dummy variable. The three different group attributes used to measure trust were educational level, professional industry, and economic level for Japan and religion, political orientation, and economic level for Taiwan, as explained in the previous section. F-test was conducted to test goodness of fit of the model in population.  Table 10  presents our regression analysis results with statistical significance (at a 5% level). Regarding attitudes toward listening among Japanese respondents, moral domains of family and property, such as relevance, reciprocity, fairness, and property for judgement, were positively correlated, while moral domains of deference, such as relevance and family for judgement, were negatively correlated. Respondents who trusted unknown foreigners had more positive attitudes toward listening. Regarding attitudes toward speaking in Japan, the moral sense of property as relevant and reciprocity of judgement were positively correlated, while the morality of deference was negatively correlated. Trust in foreigners was also positively correlated, and female respondents showed negative attitudes toward speaking. Among Taiwanese respondents, group morality as relevant and reciprocity for judgement were positively correlated with attitudes toward listening. Trust in acquaintances and unknown foreigners was positively correlated. Regarding attitudes toward speaking, moral senses of the group as relevance and heroism and property for judgement are positively correlated. Furthermore, the older the respondents, the more negative their attitudes toward speaking were.   4 Discussion 4.1 Willingness to know and talk about energy and environmental policy As shown in the previous section, a stronger willingness to know about various energy and environmental policy issues and a stronger willingness to participate in random-sampling-based citizen dialogues on energy and environmental policy were observed in Taiwan than in Japan. Since age did not affect willingness to participate in citizen dialogues, as shown in our regression analysis results from Sections 3.7 and 3.8 , the difference in age distribution between Japanese and Taiwanese respondents in our survey does not explain the difference in the distribution of willingness. Taiwanese eagerness to participate in environmental governance was conspicuous vis-à-vis the similarity in WVS indicators and Democracy Indexes 2019 and 2021. Nonetheless, a positive relationship between the willingness to learn and the willingness to talk was confirmed in both Japan and Taiwan, as shown in Tables 7 and 8 , and these results reaffirm the observations of a previous study in Japan (Nakamura, 2018 ), and extends to Taiwan. The positive effect of interest in climate change on the willingness to participate in citizen dialogues has been commonly observed in Japan and Taiwan. Being female and hesitating to talk about nuclear issues led to a negative attitude towards participation in Japan, while working status was associated with a stronger willingness to participate in Taiwan. Working experience encouraged an even stronger level of engagement in citizen dialogue in Taiwan, where the willingness to participate was already strong.  4.2 A culture of dialogue Our study shows that the attitude toward dialogues with people with differing views on social issues in Taiwan was stronger than it was in Japan, both in listening and speaking. Moreover, the weaker attitudes toward speaking than listening observed in Japan was not observed in Taiwan. The stronger attitudes toward speaking in Taiwan could be partly attributed to the ratio of younger respondents in Taiwan, because older respondents show a weaker attitude toward speaking in Taiwan (Table 10 ). Nonetheless, given the fact that such age effect was not confirmed in Japanese respondents, a stronger attitude toward speaking in Taiwan was conspicuous vis-à-vis the lower score of Taiwan in self-expression value than that of Japan, within the same cultural sphere (Inglehart, 2018 ). The International Social Survey Program (ISSP) in 2014, focusing on citizenship, revealed either similar or slightly higher participation in political and social activities (eight questions) in Taiwan compared to Japan and mixed, that is, either similar, stronger, or weaker, political efficacy (four questions) in Taiwan than in Japan (ISSP Research Group, 2016 ). This study adds a new perspective to social engagement for sustainability. The culture of dialogue, or the distribution of attitudes toward dialogue, differed between Japan and Taiwan.  4.3 Morality and boundary of collaboration Our surveying of morality using MAC-Q subscales showed that the distribution patterns among the 14 mean scores for seven morality domains for relevance and judgement were similar, with Taiwanese respondents indicating higher scores than Japanese respondents, except for the moral sense of property for judgement. This result suggests a similar priority among the seven morality domains in Japan and Taiwan. The group distribution of the moral foundation that provides the ultimate reason for collaboration might not differ considerably between Japanese and Taiwanese respondents. The boundaries of collaboration, measured by the trust ratio, revealed the perceived boundary of trust in people with different attributes. For example, in both Japan and Taiwan, more than half the respondents trusted their personal acquaintances. Moreover, trust in people in general was higher than that in an unknown person of the same nationality, and trust in an unknown person regardless of nationality was lower than that in an unknown person of the same nationality in both Japan and Taiwan. Therefore, the ability to trust decreases from acquaintances to people in general, to those in the same nation, and then to those without attributional conditions, which indicates different boundaries of collaboration. This order of trust holds true for both Japanese and Taiwanese respondents. The results also revealed that respondents imagined hypothetical people in general as people between personal acquaintances and unknown persons of the same nationality. In addition, the trust ratios among Taiwanese respondents were higher than those among Japanese respondents under all 16 attribution conditions. Furthermore, different attributes led to lower trust ratios, that is, educational level, professional industry, and economic level among Japanese respondents, and religion, political orientation, and economic level among Taiwanese respondents. These categorical groups functioned as perceived boundaries for collaboration within each society. These results suggested that the category that is important for collaboration differs between the Japanese and the Taiwanese. These groups could be boundaries for collaboration within individual societies, let alone across national borders. The WVS Wave 7 (W7), conducted in 2019 for both Japan and Taiwan, reported that the trust ratio for general trust without attributional conditions was 0.356 for Japan and 0.308 for Taiwan (Haerpfer et al., 2022 ). Therefore, the survey results in the present research (0.209 for Japan, 0.388 for Taiwan) might indicate a lower trust ratio in Japan and a higher trust ratio in Taiwan because of the modality of the internet survey, vis-à-vis postal mail-based (Japan) or face-to-face interview-based (Taiwan) survey of WVS W7. However, the order of the boundaries of trust may be the same regardless of the survey modality.  4.4 Participation, dialogue, and perceived boundary of collaboration A regression analysis between the willingness to participate in random-sampling-based citizen dialogue on energy and environmental policy and attitude toward dialogue, morality, and the boundaries of collaboration revealed several similarities and differences between the Japanese and Taiwanese contexts. First, a positive attitude toward dialogue was associated with a stronger willingness to participate in citizen dialogues in both societies, albeit in a different manner. That is, attitude toward speaking was more significant among Japanese respondents, while attitude toward listening was more significant in Taiwanese respondents. This may suggest different focal points of dialogical space development in energy and environmental policy processes in Japan and Taiwan. Potential lies in the encouragement of speaking while confronting different views and values in Japan, while they exist in the facilitation of listening in Taiwan. Second, morality affects willingness to participate in citizen dialogue and varies between Japan and Taiwan. The positive correlation with fairness, as observed in Japan, may imply that fairness signifies equal treatment of fellow citizens through citizen dialogue. The positive correlation with the moral sense of group for judgement, shown in Taiwan, indicates the effect of a sense of citizenship in the society to which they belong. The negative correlation with heroism, as is relevant in the Taiwanese case, might be because a worldview of heroism implies the division of leaders and followers, which contradicts the policy process participation of ordinary citizens. Another negative correlation with fairness in moral judgement detected in the Taiwanese case was difficult to interpret. Third, a broader boundary of collaboration, as measured by trust, was associated with a stronger willingness to participate in citizen dialogue in both Japan and Taiwan, although the boundaries differed. Among the Japanese respondents who showed lower trust ratios in general than the Taiwanese respondents, those who trusted personal acquaintances indicated a stronger willingness to talk in citizen dialogue at the national level. Among Taiwanese respondents, those who showed trust in a person regardless of nationality (without any attribution) had a stronger willingness to participate in citizen dialogue at the city/prefectural level. Moreover, in both cases, trust in a person with different attributes perceived as important (i.e., educational level for the Japanese and religion for the Taiwanese) led to a stronger willingness to participate in citizen dialogue. Overall, openness suggested by attitude toward dialogue and the boundaries of collaboration measured by trust were positively associated with willingness to participate in citizen dialogues in Japan and Taiwan. Age did not affect willingness to participate in either society; however, females showed hesitation to join citizen dialogue in Japan. This highlights the need for a gender-responsive sustainability policy process that includes biodiversity (Goldschmidt et al., 2015; The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, 2022 ). The relationship between attitudes toward dialogue, morality, and the boundaries of collaboration, as measured by trust, also showed commonalities and differences between the Japanese and Taiwanese respondents. The positive correlation between the morality of reciprocity for judgement and a positive attitude toward dialogue, commonly observed in Japan and Taiwan (i.e., listening and speaking in Japan and listening in Taiwan), may imply equal treatment of the self and others in a culture of dialogue. The positive correlation between the moral sense of the group and attitude toward dialogue, shown only in Taiwan, may suggest a specific moral effect of membership on attitude toward dialogue with fellow Taiwanese people. Regarding the boundaries of collaboration, a positive correlation between trust in an unknown person regardless of nationality and attitude toward dialogue is shown both in Japan (i.e., listening and speaking) and Taiwan (i.e., listening), while trust in acquaintances was positively correlated with an attitude toward dialogue (i.e., listening) in Taiwan. These relationships showed the link between positive attitudes toward dialogue and the epistemologically broader boundaries of collaboration within these societies. The negative correlation between being female and an attitude toward speaking in Japan, and that between age and attitude toward speaking in Taiwan, also suggests the need for attention to realize inclusive and sustainable development policy processes in each society. Attitudes toward dialogue could become more positive by attending citizen dialogue on energy and environmental policy, as demonstrated in a series of dialogues on radioactive waste management in post-Fukushima Japan (Nakamura et al., 2021 ). Higher political diversity in social networks leads to a higher level of political tolerance, even in the rather homogeneous society of Japan, which belongs to East Asian culture (Ikeda and Richey, 2012 ). Although the moral foundations and boundaries of collaboration may not easily change individually or collectively, a more open and broader boundary of collaboration may be possible through personal experiences and public institutions that encourage such experiences, such as random-sampling-based citizen dialogues on public issues. As indicated above, an enhanced attitude toward dialogue was associated with a stronger willingness to participate in citizen dialogue and energy and environmental policies.  4.5 Limitations and future research Our survey results could differ from the actual state in the population because we used an online survey, which is different from random-sampling-based postal mail or interview surveys; therefore, the distribution of the attitudinal variables should be interpreted cautiously. Nonetheless, the exploration of two East Asian societies that could be nascent in a culture of dialogue is an initial attempt, and this study contributes to linking participation in environmental policy processes and attitudes toward dialogue and collaboration, which indicates the focal points of innovative institutions and methods of participatory environmental governance in each society as well as across societies to pursue the SDGs. Further research should be focused on surveying other East Asian societies, such as South Korea, and additional surveying of the attitudinal states of participation, dialogue, and collaboration in the context of energy and environmental policy to provide a mutual understanding of societies within the Confucian cultural sphere. Moreover, this study focused on subjective recognition and the epistemic foundation of partnerships, which differ from the actual behaviors of dialogue and collaboration. To see the potential for change in perceptions and beliefs in dialogue and the boundaries of collaboration, explorative citizen dialogue on sustainability issues across societies, such as the one to talk about the SDGs between Japan and Taiwan, is needed.   5 Conclusions Employing online social surveys, we identified the willingness of the public to learn about various energy and environmental policy issues, their willingness to participate in random-sampling-based citizen dialogue on energy and environmental policy, their attitudes toward having dialogues with people who hold differing views, collaboration-based moral foundations, and the boundaries of their collaboration in Japan and Taiwan. Attitudes toward these dialogues were measured using a scale developed and utilized in research on random sampling citizen dialogues on radioactive waste management in Japan. The boundaries of collaboration were measured with a method developed by referring to the trust questionnaire in the WVS, whereas morals were measured using the MAC-Q. Moreover, the relationship between these attitudes toward participation, dialogue, and collaboration was examined to determine the epistemic potential of partnership in participatory environmental governance to overcome barriers to collaboration within and between societies, and these associations were clarified for the first time. The survey revealed a stronger willingness to know about environmental issues and participate in citizen dialogues; a more positive attitude toward dialogue, particularly for speaking; and a broader boundary of collaboration, measured by trust ratios among Taiwanese respondents than their Japanese counterparts. The ability to trust decreased from acquaintances to people in general, to those in the same nation, and then to those without attributional conditions, both in Japan and Taiwan. Significant attributes that led to lower trust ratios differed between Japanese and Taiwanese respondents, that is, educational level, professional industry, and economic level for Japanese and religion, political orientation, and economic level for Taiwanese. Although the order of significance among the seven moral domains might be similar, the moral landscape differed between the Japanese and Taiwanese respondents. The openness or tolerance implied by their attitudes toward having dialogues and their boundaries of collaboration, as measured by trust, were positively associated with willingness to participate in citizen dialogues on energy and the environment, both in Japan and Taiwan. Females were found to hesitate to join citizen dialogue in Japan after controlling for the effects of attitudes toward dialogue, moral characteristics, and boundaries of collaboration. This suggests that the intervention point toward participatory and deliberative environmental governance is nurturing a culture of dialogue through learning by doing of citizen dialogue.
