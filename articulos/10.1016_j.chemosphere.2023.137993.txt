                  Membrane-based technologies are recently being considered as effective methods for conventional water and wastewater remediation processes to achieve the increasing demands for clean water and minimize the negative environmental effects. Although there are numerous merits of such technologies, some major challenges like high capital and operating costs . This study first focuses on reporting the current membrane-based technologies, i.e., nanofiltration, ultrafiltration, microfiltration, and forward- and reverse-osmosis membranes. The second part of this study deeply discusses the contributions of membrane-based technologies in achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs) stated by the United Nations (UNs) in 2015 followed by their role in the circular economy. In brief, the membrane based processes directly impact 15 out of 17 SDGs which are SDG1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17. However, the merits, challenges, efficiencies, operating conditions, and applications are considered as the basis for evaluating such technologies in sustainable development, circular economy, and future development.

Although there are numerous merits of such technologies, some major challenges like high capital and operating costs . This study first focuses on reporting the current membrane-based technologies, i.e., nanofiltration, ultrafiltration, microfiltration, and forward- and reverse-osmosis membranes. The second part of this study deeply discusses the contributions of membrane-based technologies in achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs) stated by the United Nations (UNs) in 2015 followed by their role in the circular economy. In brief, the membrane based processes directly impact 15 out of 17 SDGs which are SDG1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17. However, the merits, challenges, efficiencies, operating conditions, and applications are considered as the basis for evaluating such technologies in sustainable development, circular economy, and future development.

Recent studies showed that around four billion people forming two-thirds of the global population live under aggressive water scarcity conditions for at least one month of the year (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2016 ). The major drivers of the increasing water scarcity are economic development, population explosion, climate change, shifted consumption patterns, and expansion of irrigated agriculture (Qin et al., 2019 ; Richter et al., 2020 ). Only 2.5% of the global water reserve is fresh water, while the remain is saline water. Moreover, most of the 2.5% is frozen water in Polar Regions and around 30% is present in remote aquifers; subsequently, it is difficult to access. Subsequently, only less than 0.01 of the total global water is easily accessible for utilization. The water is contaminated by industrial plants, fertilizer, and pesticide residues utilized in agriculture, mining and gas or oil exploration. Water reclamation and desalination are of significant importance towards water security (Le and Nunes, 2016 ). Membrane-based technologies have attracted much interest in these two areas. However, treatment efficiency, overall cost, and technical applicability are significant factors considred in selecting the optimum technology for wastewater remediation laden with recalcitrant pollutants. Reverse osmosis, microfiltration, nanofiltration, and ultrafiltration (Fig. 1  ) are all included in integrated membrane processes.. In industries like wastewater treatment, desalination, pharmaceutics, biotechnology, food and chemicals industries, extensive research and development have gone into pressure-based separation processes like microfiltration, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration, and reverse osmosis. Simplicity of operation, low energy consumption, high stability under a variety of operating circumstances, high eco-compatibility, scalability, ease of control, and great adaptability are typically acknowledged as the advantages of membrane technologies. It is now possible to combine different membrane operations in one process to increase performance in terms of product quality, plant compactness, energy use, and environmental impact (Charcosset, 2016 ). This review aims to list the membrane materials and technologies to tackle water sustainability. This review also highlights the main contributions of membrane technologies in the fulfilment of sustainable development goals, which provides researchers as well as industrial end-users with advantages, technical, economic and environmental barriers of such technologies. This work tries to answer some important questions: What are the materials, processes, and merits of membrane-based technologies for the management of heavy metals, organics, pharmaceutical residue, and other micropollutants in water and wastewater? What are the technical, economic and environmental barriers to water remediation technologies and valuable materials recovery? How to optimize the contribution of such technologies in the circular economy? Listing the major impacts of these technologies on the achievement of the 17 SDGs adopted by the United Nations.  2 Membrane-based technologies for water/wastewater treatment On a generic note, the treatment of wastewater provides support for the attainment of a clean environment. However, in making wastewater treatment meet the SDGs guidelines, the criteria are anchored on affordable technology that is simple and eco-friendly (Obaideen et al., 2022b ). The call to realize SDG6 by 2030 remains a mirage due to the lack of matching wastewater treatment technology. Therefore, there is a need to review the performance of existing wastewater treatment technologies and provide improvements to support the SDG6 guidelines. The preliminary acetate membrane for water desalination was developed in the 60s. Since then, several membraned technologies have evolved, namely, reverse osmosis, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration and microfiltration (Matsuura, 2002 ). The reengineering of membrane surfaces has led to improved methods of fouling reduction. The understanding of membrane characteristics has provided a lead in the fabrication of low-pressure modulated membranes. The use of microbial electrochemical technology to treat wastewater is emerging as an eco-friendly technique (Dizge et al., 2019 ). In addition, the molecular implications of the control of membrane porosity on effective water movement through the membrane are better understood (Liu et al., 2022 ). Several authors have worked on water and wastewater treatment using different technologies and processes. Some of the common technologies and processes are categorized into physical, biological and chemical methods (Fig. 2  ). These techniques include adsorption (i.e., the equilibration of water/wastewater with material which soaks up and retains the contaminant), ion exchange (i.e., removal of ions in the wastewater by exchange of solids in the exchange membrane, coagulation (i.e., the aggregation of particulates dispersed in water by addition of flocculating reagents), biological processes (i.e., the use of microbes to degrade organic molecules in wastewater and water), advanced oxidation processes (i.e. the use of oxidizing agents to break down organic contaminants in wastewater and water), membrane bioreactor (i.e. the use of biologically engineered reactors to aerate wastewater and breakdown complex organic contaminants), ultrasound techniques (i.e., the use of oxidizing agents engineered by hydro-mechanical forces in breaking down organic pollutants in wastewater), hydrodynamic cavitation technology (i.e., the use of pressure drop-microbubbles to generate mechanical rotations for the breakdown of organic pollutants in wastewater), advanced green technology (i.e., the use of biologically engineered filters using clean energies and non-toxic reagents to reduce contaminants in wastewater). Unfortunately, none of these technologies and processes meets the SDG6 assessment criteria. Besides, they have environmental, social, and economic implications that are adverse to a sanitized and clean water supply for the global clime. 2.1 Micro-filtration It is important to note that SDG 6 formation affirms the relevance of sustainable water management in the global political clime. It means that wastewater treatment is critical to avoid the looming water crisis. The wastewater sources come from industrial, agricultural, and domestic water usage. On the one hand, wastewater in several countries is untreated due to cost implications. On the other hand, some countries discharge wastewater into open reservoirs in direct contact with the atmosphere and earth. Unfortunately, larger suspended solids settle at the base of the reservoir; total dissolved solids and total suspended solids form a component of contaminants which require treatment (Campos et al., 2002 ). Also, several separation processes are required to reduce particulate matter in wastewater. The microfiltration technology uses a membrane filter in the bioreactor pretreatment and post-treatment stages. In addition, the membrane filters include polycarbonate, polypropylene, polyethene and carbonate. Also, the pretreatment technique entails pre-filtration using filter clothes, gelation, flocculation, adsorption, and relaxation. Several authors have worked on wastewater treatment by membrane technologies (Islam et al., 2022 ; Khashij et al., 2022 ; Yang et al., 2022 ). Fortunately, the membrane micro-filters reduce particulate matter amounts ranging from 0.1 μm to 10 μm. Hence, these filters are engineered to eliminate total suspended solids, bacteria, algae, sediments and protozoans from the water. However, the setback remains that dissolved ions and solids less than 10 μm still migrate and remain in the treatment plant. These species include ionic salts and metals, total organic matter, colloidal fractions, viruses, and coliforms. Also, wastes generated due to this technology as a pretreatment waste or/and a backwash flow need to be retreated or disposed of safely (Hua et al., 2007 ; Anis et al., 2019 ; Hakami et al., 2020 ).  2.2 Ultra-filtration It is important to note that ultrafiltration is suitable for particulates which is not retained by the microfilter membrane. This filter has a pore size ranged from 0.1 μm to 0.01 μm fractions. Interestingly, this technology is differentiated from microfiltration by the range of particle fractions retained and the higher osmotic pressure required to maintain membrane performance. Additionally, this filter retards the migration of silica, viruses and organic contaminants. Unfortunately, oily wastewater is critical to using this technology (Lin et al., 2016 ; Jiang et al., 2018 ). Regretfully, the oil-water mixture is an organic contaminant and requires a cost-effective strategy for treatment. So, the treatment of oily wastewater using ultrafiltration technology preferably owns to its simplicity, with high efficiency. However, there is a need to address setbacks. This technology is limited by the oil droplets' fouling and blocking of membrane filters. The factors known to affect the performance of ultrafiltration membrane filters include the filtering nature, operational conditions of the technology, and the optimization process. Also, dissolved ions and solids of nano-size fractions still migrate and remain in the treatment plant. These species include divalent toxic ions, lips and other organic contaminants. Also, to enhance the technology performance, materials with high water affinity are required for the membrane alteration to promote ultra-filtration membrane routine. The fouling minimization and high liquid permeation would require high-affinity materials. Also, optimum pH, temperature, salinity and oil concentration are critical to achieving the maximum benefits of this technology (Al Aani et al., 2020 ).  2.3 Nanofiltration Nanofiltration is the membrane process that lies between RO and UF. Pressures of 150–500 psi are required for the operation, which is lower than that needed for RO. Nanofiltration-based membranes have been used in water and wastewater remediation due to their unique characteristics, such as a high tendency towards divalent and polyvalent ions while they allow monovalent ions and tiny molecules (<100 Da) to pass through (Ahmad et al., 2022 ). So, they filter dyes, Cr–Pb–Sn toxic ions, carbohydrates and definite salts. Water softening, surface and groundwater remediation, wastewater treatment, and water recycling are just a few of the significant environmental applications of nanofiltration membranes that have been widely used in (Shao et al., 2022 ). So, this technology forms the final phase in most membrane technological processes. Suspended solids, organic contaminant indicator values and colour removal efficiency not captured at the micron range fractions are known to retain with increased permeation. However, in contrast, to reverse osmosis, nanofiltration membrane technology deals with pore size fractions greater than reverse osmosis. So, there is a lower removal of contaminant indicators, total suspended and dissolved solids. In addition, filtration technology in wastewater treatment is eco-friendly and sustainable. However, few modifications are required to meet the SDGs in wastewater management..  2.4 Reverse osmosis Numerous water desalination systems have been implemented for clean water production. However, the traditional thermal desalination processes have some merits such as design simplicity (Abdelaziz et al., 2021 ). The challenges toward these technologies are the low or moderate capacities (Peng et al., 2021 ). Hence, they are not proper for large-scale applications. On the other hand, membrane-based desalination technologies such as RO are characteristic of their large capacities. The RO process also faces some challenges, such as the high energy requirement (up to 4 kW m−3 ) (Greenlee et al., 2009 ), and like all membrane-based technologies, membrane fouling requires chemical cleaning (Matshetshe et al., 2021 ). However, RO is the most commonly-used desalination technique worldwide, owning its lowest cost of freshwater production. To make RO a cost-effective process, many efforts are needed to recover waste heat and minimize fuel consumption and enhance overall energy conversion efficiencies. Integrating RO units with renewable energy systems such as solar systems or photovoltaics (Fig. 3  a) is considered an optimum route for RO systems' environmental and economic sustainability. For example, the recovered energy from solar energy systems could be utilized for feed water preheating, where the performance of the RO plant is enhanced by water preheating (Lin et al., 2014 ). The discharged brine from RO plants forms a significant challenge, and managing this huge quantity of brine is still under investigation. The applicability and performance of the RO plants are based on thermal efficiencies, configurations, freshwater cost, produced water quality, parameters of water recovery and energy consumption.  2.5 Forward osmosis Forward osmosis is another osmotic-based technique that implies a semi-permeable forward osmosis (FO) membrane to separate water from dissolved matter (Obaid et al., 2020 ). The feed solution is located on the FO membrane side, and the high salt concentration solution is placed on the other side. Purified water will transfer from the feed solution to the other side via the membrane by the osmotic pressure. The FO can utilize different water resources such as seawater, river, lake and wastewater as feed to produce potable water. Sugars, polyelectrolytes and salts can be utilized as draw solution solutes. This process differs from reverse osmosis, where it doesn't need extra applied pressure on the feed solution. A pretreatment stage is still needed to separate the draw solution from the pure water, such as ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, and thermal decomposition of the solute. Subsequently, the FO process is usually integrated with another treatment process in a hybrid system (Fig. 3 b) (Emadzadeh et al., 2019 ). For example, forward osmosis was integrated with membrane distillation, and the hybrid system was used to manage the outlet of a water/oil separator. The system recorded high removal efficiency (>93%) of organics, inorganics and oil-yielding permeate of high quality, which is suitable for reuse in the industrial sector. The forward osmosis streams were highly concentrated (77–84%), yielding low disposal volumes. The sustainability and applicability of these hybrid systems are related to the no need for chemicals or water. Additionally, no membrane wetting or bacteria were detected. The system faced some technical challenges, such as the internal concentration polarization caused by monovalent ions and the FO flux reduction caused by CaSiO3  colloidal scaling on the support layer. On the active layer, CaSO4  and NaCl crystals further lowered the FO flux, and organic Nano pollutants and volatile fatty acids can reach the permeate (Saqib Nawaz et al., 2022 ). Given the current state of membrane technology and processes, there is no single magic that seems to solve the morphological issues of water and wastewater treatment. Hence, a combination of several membrane technologies inclusive, forward-reverse osmosis is needed to effectively tackle water and wastewater treatment. How fast we around the use of forward osmosis is dependent on the techno-economic analysis that favours low-cost and simple production of the membrane (Vinardell et al., 2020 ).   3 Contributions of membrane-based technologies to sustainable development goals The world is facing different crises that impact humanity and the environment, including water scarcity, energy crisis, climate change and conflict predominate, COVID-19, the Russia-Ukraine war, and others. These crises directly impacted the seventeen SDGs stated by the UNs in 2015 (Fig. 4  ). However, serious actions should be taken as a road map for survival to achieve sustainability in the world. Developing pathways that will provide clean water and affordable energy, minimize carbon emissions, conserve limited natural resources, create better sufficient jobs, promote the transition to a greener environment, improve health and develop economic growth, etc. This road map is clear via achieving these SDGs (Sayed et al., 2021a ; Obaideen et al., 2022a ; Salameh et al., 2022 ; Shehata et al., 2022a ; Shehata et al., 2022b ; Olabi et al., 2023 ).• SDG1: No poverty     Water is crucial for many requirements and demands of individuals and society at large. Almost every institution in society, including workplaces, offices, colleges, schools, and many more, need water (Sims and Kasprzyk-Hordern, 2020 ). Furthermore, civilizations might not be able to guide people toward success and advancement without water. A community or nation must function well and have favourable conditions for working as a whole to advance. Water availability also affects societies' growth because better infrastructure can only be achieved when clean water is widely available (Obaideen et al., 2022b ). Generally, water is an essential element used in most human-related activities. It is essential to have consistently clean water if a society wants to advance. One such idea that might enable nations and communities to fulfil the water requirements in order to carry out the necessary duties has been recognized as wastewater reclamation. The stakeholders are involved in procedures through which water could be brought to be utilized in numerous ways. Thanks to developments being achieved in wastewater recovery and reuse via membrane-based technologies (Hernández-Sancho et al., 2015 ). These technologies create employment opportunities that can lower the unemployment rate (Renner, 2017 ). These techniques will eventually lower the price of fresh water, boosting society's economy. The wastewater treatment facility might also create high-quality fertilizer while bringing down its cost, particularly for smallholders (Løes, 2021 ). Membrane-based technologies could be implemented on a small scale suitable for rural or small communities.• SDG2: Zero hunger     The world is facing an upcoming food crisis, the individuals suffering from food insecurity and hunger and the recent COVID-19 pandemic increased this impact. Around 828 million people all over the world experienced hunger in 2021. The war in Ukraine increased the impact of food insecurity globally; the potential for malnutrition and hunger is increased with a special focus on developing and poor countries. With this increasingly global crisis, it is important to address the causes and introduce a solution Nations, U., 2022  . The contribution of membrane-based technologies in food production occurs via several routes, including the industrial process, implementation of fertilizers, fixing water for irrigation, and minimizing the negative impacts of the discharged wastewater that may kill plants. The membrane technology has been applied to enhance the food quality and quantity owing to the ease of separating different kinds of juices and milk from water. For this purpose, membrane filtration, including reverse osmosis, nanofiltration, microfiltration and ultrafiltration, at different particle sizes and mechanisms of separation (Fig. 5  ) have been applied. Although the separation mechanism of the membrane mainly depends on size exclusion, numerous other mechanisms could govern the separation process such as electrostatic interaction, hydrophobicity, adsorption and ion exchange (Fig. 5 ). The mechanism depends on the pollutants' characteristics, operating conditions, membrane type, etc. The contribution of membranes in the food industry involves the concentration or/and purification of various types of food in dairy (with a special focus on cheese and yoghurt), vegetables and drinks. Microfiltration is common for separating large particles, while reverse osmosis is preferable for treating saltwater (Ren et al., 2021 ; Manikandan et al., 2022 ). Membrane-based technology provides clean water which is necessary for agriculture because it is the primary resource used in food production. Farmers may not be able to raise crops or engage in associated activities if they do not have access to enough water. Poor living circumstances would eventually result in farmers being unable to raise crops or perform other associated tasks due to a lack of water. Some vegetables like tomatoes, are fertilized with organic materials such as oil press waste. Soaking the cultivated seeds with pre-treated sewage enhances sprout growth compared to raw wastewater. Also, the growth parameters of the plants watered with treated sewage were close to the control group. Although there was an increase in the pH of the soil owned to the organic acid mineralization and the ammonium processing, the pH value was stabilized after a few days (Ngo et al., 2021 ). Also, processing of maize with the aid of treated wastewater discharged from an olive mill showed that the treatment process had improved the percentages of the main nutrients (nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus) in the soil. Additionally, beans irrigated with clean water and sewage represented promising results due to the plants' significant increase in nitrogen and phosphate percentage (Manikandan et al., 2022 ). Agriculture affects three main resources; freshwater required for irrigation, nutrients used in fertilizer production and energy consumed in fertilizer production. The increased population and agricultural activities increase the aggressive consumption of these resources. The global phosphorus stocks are declining due to increased fertilizer production; subsequently, there is an urgent need to find alternative solutions/resources to ensure sustainability. Wastewater reuse is an efficient alternative because it lowers the stress on fresh water and other resources, such as nutrients, that can substitute the cultivation needs of fertilizers and contribute to the circular economy. The reuse of wastewater in agriculture was recorded in the literature, and also it implemented at a large scale for the irrigation of uneatable plants (Manikandan et al., 2022 ). One of the major drivers for the wide implementation of membrane-based technologies is that the cost of water desalination became more competitive with the increased cost of surface water and groundwater. Owning to the huge quantity of global saline water compared to fresh water, desalination is more sustainable. However, the desalination cost is still high for its actual implementation in the irrigation sector. The desalinated water can be used to irrigate high-value crops such as flowers and vegetables cultivated in coastal areas or greenhouses where brines can be managed safely. Upgrading the quality of the treated water lowers the negative impacts on the crops and soil compared to the brackish water. Other benefits of using desalinated water in the agricultural sector include extra sustainable resources for water which is not affected by the weather, improvement in the quality of the agricultural products, increment in the production yield, low consumption of water and recovery of some valuable salts (Zarzo et al., 2013 ; Burn et al., 2015 ). Moreover, the high quality of irrigation water is not required for agriculture. Partially desalinated water could be appropriate for salt-resistant crops (Tester and Langridge, 2010 ). The use of desalinated water in irrigation has increased globally. The application of desalinated water in irrigation has been successfully implemented in Spain with a capacity of up to 1.4 million m3  d−3  where brackish water is used as the feed and the desalination plants located in coastal areas or near the sea. Kuwait is also applying desalinated water at a high percentage (13%) in agriculture, followed by Saudi Arabia with a percentage (0.5%) of its desalination capacity. In addition to other countries like China, Australia and Chile, are also considering the possibility of integrating agriculture with desalination technologies (Le and Nunes, 2016 ). For irrigation purposes, RO is the preferable desalination technology owing to its cost-effectiveness and maturity (Burn et al., 2015 ) where brackish and sea water can be utilized as resources. The seawater is characterised by elevated salinity (35 g L−1 ), which is equivalent to the osmotic pressure of 2.800 × 103  kPa compared to brackish water with a salinity up to 1.6 g L−1  which corresponding to an equivalent osmotic pressure of up to 0.140 × 103  kPa (Burn et al., 2015 ), thus desalination of seawater requires a considerable higher hydraulic pressure and subsequently higher consumed energy than brackish water. The desalinated water is slightly acidic, and it is characterised by a lower percentage of calcium and some other minerals, resulting in a negative impact on the soil. Hence, this water needs a post-treatment step for re-mineralization (adjusting the mineral quantities); the cost of this technique is negligible compared to the overall desalination cost (Zarzo et al., 2013 ). Partial desalination using nanofiltration could also reduce the hydraulic pressure and enhance the mineral percentage of the produced desalinated water compared to RO. Another challenge facing the applications of desalinated water in irrigation is the presence of boron, even at a low percentage (0.3–4 mg L−1 ), owing to its toxicity to various crops (Guerreiro et al., 2002 ) and its permeability across various membranes is high. Extra treatment, such as an ion exchanger pre-treatment, is required to reduce the boron percentage to an acceptable limit (Zarzo et al., 2013 ), which forms additional expenses that increase the capital cost of the desalination plant. The management of the retentate stream of RO is another challenge in inland desalination plants, which increases the overall cost of the process (Le and Nunes, 2016 ).• SDG3: Good health and wellbeing    Improper management of wastewater, especially industrial wastewater, has negative impacts on the ecosystems. For example, wastewater discharged from oilfields which contain xylene, ethylbenzene, toluene, and benzene, causes aggressive effects on poisoning, skin diseases, aplastic anaemia, neurological issues, inhalation injuries, leukaemia, and others (Rahman et al., 2018 ). Polyaromatic hydrocarbons gained much interest recently owing to their carcinogenic characteristics and oxidative stress (Sturve et al., 2006 ), embryotoxicity (Carls et al., 2008 ), cardiac function defects (Incardona et al., 2004 ), and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage (Aas et al., 2000 ). Besides industrial wastewater, biopharmaceutical residue discharged from hospital and healthcare wastewater can result in numerous infectious diseases and severe thousands of deaths annually. Recently, pandemic and epidemic outbreak exposure via the different virus particles such as avian influenza A virus (H5N1), influenza, swine influenza virus (H1N1), pandemic H1N1/09 flu virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona virus (Jefferson et al., 2008 ; Habibi-Yangjeh et al., 2020 ), and recent corona virus (SARS-CoV-2), recorded millions of deaths worldwide (Alam et al., 2021b ). Water-based diseases, such as acute hepatitis, gastroenteritis, pneumonia, diarrhoea, encephalitis, paralysis, conjunctivitis, myocarditis and respiratory infections (Woodall, 2009 ; Altintas et al., 2015b ; Gall et al., 2015 ), have widely spread through both surface water and groundwater (Rigotto et al., 2010 ). Other viruses, including enteroviruses, rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, hepatitis-A and -E, and astrovirus (Caygill et al., 2010 ; Cashdollar and Wymer, 2013 ; Altintas et al., 2015a ) cause significant health hazards and sometimes death as reported by World Health Organization (WHO) (Hamza et al., 2009 ). Hence, the current challenge is to remove such pollutants from wastewater safely. Membrane-based technologies are common routes to hinder the discharge of numerous pollutants. Eco-friendly membranes based on nano-cellulose (cellulose nanofibers, nanowhiskers and nanocrystals) have gained the attention of scientists owing to their abundance, low cost, biodegradability, large specific surface area, efficiency, renewability, stability under a broad range of pH, flexibility, high permeability, excellent hydrophilicity, and promising mechanical strength (Alam et al., 2021b ). Membranes that developed from regenerated cellulose, mille-feuille cellulose, and cladophora cellulose recorded promising results in retaining the virus by size exclusion technique. The cellulose-based membrane can also be supported with a repellence mechanism or electrostatic interaction. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers are trying to develop an effective membrane for the SARS-CoV-2 virus; however, cellulose-based membrane processes could effectively prevent or even reduce the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Alam et al., 2021b ; Erkoc and Ulucan-Karnak, 2021 ). Figure (6)   represents the merits, demerits, and the removed virus by different membranes. Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl are considered persistent micropollutants owning to their persistence, toxicity, ubiquity and bio-accumulation in the ecosystems. These compounds can cause kidney cancer, testicular cancer, high cholesterol, thyroid disease, and ulcerative colitis (Hekster et al., 2003 ), in addition to various health impacts on cancer, and the immune system (Blake et al., 2018 ; Jin et al., 2021b ). Fig. (7)   shows the application of two membranes in industrial high-temperature chemical processes. Other membrane-based processes like NF, FO and their hybrid systems have also recorded promising results for the rejection of numerous pesticides. For example, an investigation carried out on 158 kinds of pesticides, commercial reverse osmosis membranes recorded significant results (Fujioka et al., 2020 ). Removal of pesticides from water bodies is a real challenge owing to their complexity. Moreover, developing integrated membrane technologies with other biological or chemical processes will introduce a new horizon in the water treatment area. However, all the issues that are related to the above-mentioned micropollutants can be managed with a sustainable, eco-friendly and economic membrane-based technologies strategy (Goh et al., 2022 ).• SDG5: Gender equality     Potable water is one of the basic human requirements, affecting the lives and health of women and men. Women face more challenges concerning wastewater as they are much more susceptible to dealing domestically with wastewater at home, on agricultural farms, etc. Additionally, most women do underpaid or even unpaid work in various sectors, with a special focus on the domestic and agricultural levels. In addition to their low income, they are also exposed to untreated or/and contaminated water for daily household use (Obaideen et al., 2022b ).• SDG6: Clean water and sanitation     Proper management of drinking water and hygiene sanitation services is vital to humans and ecosystems. However, billions of individuals around the world will not have access to these vital services by 2030, if any considerable progress doesn't occur. The increasing demand for potable water is attributed to sustainable development, including urbanization, rapid population growth, as well as the increased pressure from different sectors such as agriculture, energy and industry sectors. Above all these, the poor management of water resources, misuse and contamination of surface water and groundwater have generated an extra burden on achieving SDG6. This negatively affects human health, food and energy resources and economic activities. Quick and restrictive action is required to change the current situation. To achieve sustainable fresh water, water management and wastewater remediation should be efficiently improved (Nations). As highlighted by SDG-6, management of freshwater resources, desalination and wastewater remediation are significant challenges worldwide. Membrane-based technologies showed substantial results in water management and wastewater treatment. These technologies have numerous advantages such as efficiency, flexibility, eco-friendly, ease of operation, and applicability (Yusuf et al., 2020 ). Among all membrane-based technologies, reverse osmosis is the most preferable for water desalination (Fig. 8  ) due to its low energy needs and simplicity (Giwa and Hasan, 2018 ). Subsequently, RO is the predominant technique in desalination plants worldwide to mitigate the salinity of various feed sources. The capacity of RO plants is higher than that of thermal-based desalination plants worldwide. This is attributed to the fact that thermal-based desalination plants consume huge amounts of energy to heat the saline water, and the required energy is mainly supplied by fossil fuels (Giwa and Dindi, 2017 ). Additionally, this technology is eco-friendly. Still, some challenges toward the wide application of membrane-based technologies, such as scaling-up, quality of the effluent and cost of the pretreatment, are still present (Yusuf et al., 2020 ). Concerning municipal wastewater, some members-based technologies such as membrane biological reactors (MBRs) showed higher performance than traditional activated sludge processes used in wastewater treatment plants. This technology is characteristic of efficient adsorption via enhanced sludge properties, large specific surface area and high biomass concentration, promising biodegradation performances. In addition to the removal of numerous contaminants attached to rejectable particulates and colloids due to the separation action of the membrane matrix, The MBRs have been discussed for the removal of other pollutants, such as platinum, with efficiency up to 65% (Gouveia et al., 2022 ). Membrane-aerated biological reactor employ membranes to attach biofilms; oxygen is also introduced to the system. The membrane enhances the O2  diffusion and the simultaneous nitrification/denitrification (Landes et al., 2013 , 2021 ; Li and Zhang, 2018 ). The main advantages of MBRs include lowering the odours, minimizing foaming, and lowering the aeration and energy requirements. It also minimizes solid treatment and reduces associated costs (Pourbavarsad et al., 2021 ). Numerous hybrid systems of membrane-based technologies have been used as a pretreatment unit for another process in the same plant. For example, a combination between RO and nanofiltration occurred to remediate the distillery wastewater from major pollutants such as chemical oxygen demand (COD), color, potassium and total dissolved solids (TDS) with an efficiency up to 97%. Another hybrid system based on RO and ultrafiltration has been implemented to remediate wastewater from reactive tinting (Manikandan et al., 2022 ). Water scarcity in numerous countries is the main driver for searching for unconventional water management methods. One of these methods is to harvest water from ambient air via dehumidification. This process consumes considerable energy for condensation purposes, thus numerous investigations have been proposed to increase the overall energy efficiency of this process. For example, a hybrid hollow fiber membrane is applied for the dehumidification of air and harvesting humidity in order to produce safe water simultaneously. It was reported that such a system can develop 1 m3  of fresh air at 8.0 kJ. Additionally, it also yields clean water as a by-product. It was reported that 1 kg of potable water consumes only 687.4 kJ compared to 1125 kJ when directly using atmospheric air. Therefore, this proposed membrane technology could save 38.9% of consumed energy (Zhao et al., 2019 ). Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are an emerging technology that is used effectively in simultaneous wastewater treatment and electricity generation (Mohamed et al., 2017 ; Sayed et al., 2020a , 2020b , 2021b ). The cells are generally composed of an anode and cathode separated by a membrane. The membrane is essential to avoid mixing the oxygen used at the cathode and the anaerobic microorganisms at the anode. Even some types are membraneless. Although the various features of the microbial fuel cells still challenge low electricity generation and high cost when using Pt catalyst at the cathode.• SDG7: Affordable and clean energy     Although the world achieves new affordable energy advancements, the actual progress is not enough to achieve SDG7 by 2030. Millions of humans still can't access electricity, and this fact has a hazardous impact on the health of around 2.4 billion individuals who don't perform healthy, clean cooking. The COVID-19 pandemic caused an increase in the production and transportation cost of photovoltaic modules, biofuels and wind turbines worldwide, introducing more burden on achieving SDG7 ambitions (Nations). Overcoming the aggressive depletion of energy resources and the subsequent environmental issues is a priority at a global level. Although using renewable energy is a good choice owing to its benefits and sustainability, developing energy from waste will significantly contribute to the circular economy as well as sustainability. Wastes such as waste heat rejected brine, and cooling water discharged from the membrane can be used to lower the overall energy needs in another process. Pressure energy is produced through pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) that combines the merits of the salinity difference between seawater and a somewhat degraded freshwater supply. Additionally, PRO could take advantage of the rejected brine from a RO process as a source of osmotic pressure that can be converted into mechanical power and then into electric power. The developed electricity could be used as input to the RO unit to minimize the overall energy utilization. The hybrid system combination maximizes the benefits of two membrane-based processes. For example, a combination between PRO and RO showed that the energy produced by PRO is used to compensate for that used by the RO (Prante et al., 2014 ). Membrane-based technologies can be used for biohydrogen production. The latter is a sustainable energy source and has several advantages. However, there are still some challenges related to biohydrogen production at a large industrial scale owing to the low yield of biohydrogen and the process instability. Some membrane-based technologies used for wastewater treatment could be modified for biohydrogen production such as microbial electrolysis cells and fermentative membrane bioreactors. The operation of MBRs under anaerobic conditions (fermentation) enhances the biohydrogen production rate. This is attributed to the fact that anaerobic MBRs inhibit the biomass leakage from the bioreactor, hence increasing their retention time in the bioreactor which results in high performance at a short hydraulic retention time and biohydrogen of high quality in addition to that type of reactor has small plant footprint compared to other reactors such as continuous stirred tank reactor (Aslam et al., 2014 ; Charfi et al., 2017 ). There are additional merits to this type of membrane reactor, such as inhibition of soluble products (alcohols and carboxylic acids) accumulation that can limit the fermentative biohydrogen production, increase biohydrogen yields and substrate utilization rates and promote volatile fatty acid production (El-Qelish et al., 2022 ). The major challenge towards the implementation of MBRs at a large scale is membrane fouling. Another membrane-based technology can be used to develop some biofuels from wastewater, such as.• Methane    Methane can be developed in Microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) electrochemically and biologically routed. The methane co-exists with hydrogen at the MEC cathode (Cusick et al., 2010 ), lowering the hydrogen market value and increasing its refinement efficiency (Pant et al., 2012 ). Additionally, the production of the two fuels results in the applied potential needed for developing CH4  being less than that of H2 .• Ethanol    Ethanol can be developed using microbial electroreduction of acetate with the aid of bacterial biocathodes (Pant et al., 2012 ). MECs overcome the drawbacks of traditional biological processes used for ethanol production. Previous studies showed that Methyl Viologen could be used as an electron mediator for ethanol production from acetate in MEC. The ethanol yield depends mainly on the MV concentration. The mechanism is still unclear (Hamelers et al., 2010 ).• SDG8: Decent work and economic growth     The COVID-19 pandemic caused the worst economic crisis in the last decades and although the global economy started to rebound in 2021, the sequences of the pandemic still exist (Elsaid et al., 2021 ; Olabi et al., 2022b ). Developed economies are recovered faster than developing ones. Various small firms, especially those in low-income communities are specifically disadvantaged. The most impacted labor groups (i.e., the last to be recovered) are women, persons with disabilities and youth (Nations). The membrane-based technologies contribute to SDG8 via different routes including the subsequent new plants and more jobs as well as the indirect impact such as human well-being and improved productivity. The membrane-based technologies can be operated by electricity-based renewable energy whose cost is expected to lower by 20–30% in the next years (Child et al., 2019 ). Some of these technologies are applied at a large scale, and some of them are still carried out at a lab scale such as MEC. The MEC, a sustainable promising technology, provides several merits; wastewater remediation, hydrogen production, and low energy demand compared to the traditional activated sludge process (Olabi et al., 2020 ; Wilberforce et al., 2021 ; Jadhav et al., 2022 ; Park et al., 2023 ). The big challenge toward the application of MEC at a large scale is the elevated initial cost of the equipment. More investigations are required to increase the electrode life span up to 20 years and reduce its cost by 90% to make this technology applicable in wastewater treatment (Aiken et al., 2019 ). However, the environmental impact of these technologies is better than the common activated sludge process, which is currently implemented in current wastewater treatment plants throughout their whole life cycle, having the potential of reducing CO2  emission by 86 tons m−3  of treated wastewater owing to the generation of sustainable green hydrogen that replace fossil fuels (Zhang et al., 2019 ). It can be concluded that the economics of the MEC technology is mainly based on the implementation of restricted legislations of CO2  emissions and the subsequent carbon credits and green production incentives (El-Qelish et al., 2022 ). The membrane-based technologies can contribute to economic growth, especially when combined in integrated systems. For example, the RO technique is successfully implemented in water desalination and salt recovery. For example, the feasibility and performance of a hybrid system consisting of high-pressure reverse osmosis, brine concentrator, and brine crystallizer (Fig. 9  ) for desalination and salt valorization have been evaluated. The system, which consumed 20.23 kWh/m3 , recorded a high recovery rate of 99.19%. This system is more cost-effective than common evaporation ponds. The daily profit gain from salts is ranged from US$ 196.36 to US$ 285.63 (Panagopoulos, 2022 ).• SDG9: Industry, innovation and infrastructure     The COVID-19 pandemic has confirmed the significance of innovative technologies, industrialization, and resilient infrastructure in establishing a better future and achieving SDG9 (Nations). However, the membrane-based industries recovered faster and performed better which strongly contributes to achieving SDG9. The interest in membrane-based processes for the water-energy nexus is increasingly attracting investments and inventiveness. The following sections discuss in more detail some industries which mainly depend on membranes. Microbial electrolysis cell (MEC), a recent membrane-based technology, is used to produce sustainable green hydrogen from numerous kinds of wastewater and renewable biomass (Olabi et al., 2020 ; Wilberforce et al., 2021 ). However, some technical and economic barriers toward MEC technology are present, such as reducing the energy required, improving the hydrogen production rate and upscaling the reactor with the appropriate design. Although there are different types of MEC rectors, most of the investigations were carried out in reactors consisting of two chambers and a membrane (Fig. 10  a). This is attributed to the fact that this design prevents the leakage of hydrogen into the anode chamber where hydrogenotrophic microorganisms could probably utilize it. The membrane also upgrades the hydrogen production via separating the product from the CO2  generated at the anode, increasing the purity of the hydrogen purity at the cathode. On the other hand, the membrane causes a high pH variation across the membrane (Rozendal et al., 2007 ). Also, the membranes of the MEC are high to some extent (Hu et al., 2008 ). Lowering the costs and modifying the MECs reactor design are key factors for the wide application of such technology on the industrial scale. Fig. 10 b concludes the main keys in the MEC performance and efficiency. These systems will be able to develop economic, green and sustainable hydrogen energy from any renewable biomass (Kadier et al., 2016b ). The key factors affecting the performance of the mambrane are summarized in Fig. 11  . The MEC has numerous applications such as value-added chemicals (formic acid, hydrogen peroxide and sodium hydroxide), waste/wastewater treatment (domestic, agricultural and industrial), biofuel production (hydrogen, methane and ethanol), contaminants scavenging (azo dyes and trichloroethylene) and resources recovery (lead, copper, ammonia, and many other metals). MECs have been utilized for the production of numerous value-added products as follows.• Hydrogen peroxide    Hydrogen peroxide is a common chemical that has been used in numerous applications. The production process occurs via the microbial oxidation of organic compounds at the MEC anode and oxygen reduction in the MEC cathode at up to 83% overall process efficiency. However, the input potential demand for hydrogen peroxide production in MECs is considerably low compared to that of the electrochemical process (Rozendal et al., 2009 ). The feasibility of this technology at the industrial scale depends on increasing the hydrogen peroxide yield.• Formic acid    Formic acid can be developed in MECs by organic matter degradation at the anode and CO2  reduction at the cathode. This product is of significant interest in the paper, pulp, and pharmaceutical industries (Zhao et al., 2012 ). Another benefit of formic acid production in MEC process is recycling the CO2  generated during wastewater management. Hence, this technology enhances greenhouse gas reduction (Kadier et al., 2016a ). The major challenges toward the production of formic acid using this membrane-based technique at the industrial scale are that the productivity and yield of formic acid are still very low. Ammonia production from urine in the MEC is preferable to that in MFC. This is because the generated hydrogen eliminates the aeration requirements at the cathode, which is needed in MFC, and the produced green hydrogen has a higher economic value than electricity (Bora et al., 2022 ).• SDG11: Sustainable cities and communities     People's interest in living in cities is increasing every day, and it was reported that by 2050, around seven out of ten people will prefer living in urban cities where economic growth is the main drive, cities are contributing by more than 80% of the global GDP. On the other hand, they are responsible for higher than 70% of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. However, poorly and rapid planned urbanization results in numerous challenges, including and not limited to insufficient infrastructure, shortage of affordable housing, hazardous levels of air pollution, and water contamination (Nations). Strengthening the resilience and preparedness of cities is based mainly on high-quality purified water which is directly related to the development of membrane-based processes utilized in desalination, water remediation and wastewater remediation as well as recovery of numerous valuable materials.5 SDG12: Responsible consumption and production    Domestic material consumption refers to the total materials that are directly utilized to fulfil the economic requirements. It was reported that this value rose by more than 65% during the period from 2000 to 2019 globally, which is equivalent to 12.3 tons/person and around 70% of global materials consumed in Europe, Northern America, Eastern and South-Eastern Asia. This growth is attributed to industrialization, increased population growth, etc. However, the increased consumption of natural resources increased the burden on human lives as well as sensitive ecosystems. To face this challenge, these resources should be utilized efficiently, and the linear economy should be transformed into a circular one (Nations). One of the major advantages associated with implementing membranes in wastewater technologies is the recovery of different valuable materials, whereas recent investigations on zero-liquid discharge techniques are focused on the recovery of metals from desalinated water. For example, radium has been recovered with a pellet reactor (Yusuf et al., 2020 ). Reverse osmosis is commonly evaluated for metal recovery. It recorded high recovery (>99%) of As(V), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II) (91–94). The main challenges of the wide applications of RO in this area are the high-pressure and energy required for operation and fouling. Dissolved salts such as sodium chloride and sodium sulfate have been recovered from RO brine via separation of the desalinated water from the blowdown, followed by concentration and crystallization. Although this technique is suitable for boilers blowdown, it is not appropriate for other types of wastewater (wastewater discharged from an integrated gasification combined cycle and wet flue gas desulfurization plants), which contain ammonium, calcium and magnesium salts owing to the difficulty of crystalizing these salts (Yusuf et al., 2020 ). Due to their sieving effects and surface charge, nanofiltration and reverse osmosis have been efficiently applied to recover some heavy metals such as lead, arsenic and chromium, which recorded negative impacts on humans, animals, and plants (Garg and Jain, 2022 ). The efficient recovery of some valuable chemicals, such as poly- and per-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) from water contributes to the circular economy, especially if these chemicals are present above the trace level (Hang et al., 2015 ). Concentrated solutions of PFASs can be used as raw materials or precursors in various applications such as friction reducers, repellents of water, surfactants and dirt. However, PFASs micelles could be accumulated on the membrane when the concentration is above the critical micelle concentration. The efficiency of recovery depends on the chain length of the PFASs where the rate of recovery is higher in the case of a long chain than a short one. For example, nine perfluoroalkyl acids (perfluoropentanoic acid, perfluorobutyric acid, perfluorohexanoic acid, perfluorononanoic acid, PFOA, perfluorodecanoic acid, PFBS, PFOS and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid) have been recovered from water using NF270 membrane with efficiency reached up to 93% (Appleman et al., 2013 ). NF270 and NF200 and other nanofilteration-based membranes have been used to recover fifteen PFASs. The rejections reached >95% for anionic species of molecular weight >300 g mol−1  where the size exclusion is the main mechanism (Jin et al., 2021a ). Ultrafiltration has been successfully recovered 99% of Pb(II), Cu(II), Ni(II), Zn(II) and Cd(II) from wastewater. Although this technique recorded high recovery efficiency, an extra post-treatment is still required to reuse water-soluble polymers and surfactants and recover metal ions. Nanofiltration is used to reject bivalent salts while partially permitting monovalent salts such as NaCl. Thus, nanofiltration is an effective technique for recovering heavy metals since all of them are bivalent or higher. This promising technique can reject heavy metal ions such as chromium (Muthukrishnan and Guha, 2008 ), nickel (Murthy and Chaudhari, 2008 ), cadmium (Zhu et al., 2014a ), lead (Gao et al., 2014 ), arsenic (Figoli et al., 2010 ), and copper (Ahmad and Ooi, 2010 ) from water. The main advantages of this technique are ease of operation, low consumed energy, high efficiency and reliability (Eriksson, 1988 ). Membranes with the tendency and capacity to efficiently recover specific salts and metals would be a significant achievement (Le and Nunes, 2016 ).• SDG13: Climate change     The world is facing a climate catastrophe and increased floods, droughts and temperatures (Olabi et al., 2022a ). According to the Paris Agreement, the generated greenhouse gases must be minimized before 2025, followed by a reduction up to 43% by 2030, and finally falling to net zero by 2050 to restrict the warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. Thus, serious climate action plans are required to cut these harmful emissions. Unfortunately, the current globally commitments are not enough to achieve SDG13, and it was estimated that the current national commitments allow an increment in greenhouse gas emissions (Nations). The gas-permeable membrane is a novel technique. It is used to minimize NH3  emissions emitted from wastewater and recover an important nutrient, i.e. nitrogen. Concerning conventional wastewater management technology, this technique can minimize global warming by 14% and marine eutrophication by 32%. This treatment can also lower ozone formation, affecting human health and ecosystems by 48% and 50%, respectively. On the other hand, it increases terrestrial acidification by 16% and particulate matter formation by 17% because of partial NH3  volatilization. The estimated freshwater eutrophication of this technology is close to the conventional treatment process. One of the challenges facing the implementation of this technology in wastewater treatment is the high content of phosphorous in the organic fertilizers, which causes eutrophication effects. Overall, the gas-permeable membrane is more environmentally sustainable than the traditional treatment. Subsequently, this technology is a promising option for environmental management systems in areas that are characterised by a high nutrient imbalance or low water quality (González-García et al., 2022 ).• SDG14: Life below water     Human activity is affecting the planet's largest ecosystem, its oceans and seas. Rising temperatures and acidification of oceans are negatively impacting marine ecosystem services and threatening marine species. For example, the oceans are increasingly polluted with numerous classical and recent micropollutants, which negatively impact marine life and subsequently enter the food chain. The irresponsible consumption of fish which rose by 122% from 1990 until 2018, along with insufficient national policies for managing this sector, have yielded the depletion of fish stocks (Nations). The coral, fish species and many planktonic organisms had disappeared from the coastal area due to the increase in the salinity of seas resulting from discharging brine into the seas. It was expected that discharging brine into the seas will raise the salinity of the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea by 1160 and 810 mg L−1  by 2050 (Bashitialshaaer et al., 2011 ) and if this brine contains a high metal percentage, damage in the biological communities and reduction in echinoderm densities of seagrass meadows may occur (Yusuf et al., 2020 ). Other studies reported increased leaf necrosis in Posidonia oceanic meadows, increased morality of the P. oceanica up to 100% and a negative impact on the overall abundance of meiofaunal with the increase in salinity. One of the major pollution sources to marine life is oil-produced water, it possesses toxicity to the marine ecosystems (Yeung et al., 2015 ), and the risk increases with increasing the quantities and concentration of the discharged water (Samuel et al., 2022b ). Another source of marine pollution is the colored wastewater from different industrial plants which possess human health and environmental risks owning to its direct effect on the photosynthesis process. In addition to many other micropollutants that are discharged from the industrial sectors. However, membrane-based technologies for industrial wastewater treatments have been widely applied to mitigate the associated risk of these micropollutants. For example, modified ultrafiltration membranes have been implemented to enhance the hydrophilicity characteristics of the nanocomposite-based membranes. The modified membranes have been utilized to remediate discharged wastewater from palm oil mills. The membrane that developed from polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and titania nanotubes (TNT) at 0.5 wt fraction gave the best color removal efficiency (59.4%) at a flux rate 35.7 L m−2  h−1  (Garg and Jain, 2022 ). Poly- and per-fluoroalkyl substances are detected in industrial products as well as polluted breast milk, human blood (Müller et al., 2019 ), vegetables, fish, and other foods in polluted water. They are also present in aquatic environments such as lakes, rivers, groundwater and tributaries (Briggs et al., 2020 ). Numerous treatment processes have been investigated to manage PFOS in water and solutions owning to their toxicity and associated risk (Nzeribe et al., 2019 ). To remove PFASs from water, thermal oxidation, thermal degradation, photocatalysis, reduction and sonochemical, are studied. However, the main challenges toward these techniques are the high-energy consumption and the relatively slow kinetic rates (Kucharzyk et al., 2017 ). Although some treatment processes like adsorption and ion exchange are effective, the required reaction time is long (Hopkins et al., 2018 ). Liquid/liquid extraction represented high removal efficiency, but it yields secondary pollutants in produced water (2016). Membrane-based technologies have been widely investigated to manage PFASs in aqueous solutions. The most common membrane-based technologies used to remediate wastewater from PFASs are RO, adsorption-based membranes, and nanofiltration (Jin et al., 2021a ). Pesticides are another common water pollutants which are remarkably detected in water streams during rain time (Szöcs et al., 2017 ). The leakage of pesticides into groundwater or surface water may occur as a result of agricultural runoff water discharging (Kaushal et al., 2021 ; Ulrich et al., 2022 ). The toxicity of pesticides has been systematically investigated (Fu et al., 2022 ; Seo et al., 2022 ). Briefly, these pesticides have negative impacts on biota even at low concentrations. The pesticides can be transmitted to biota via inhalation skin contact, or ingestion. Moreover, pesticides have negative impacts on health, including and not limited to disorders in human reproductive, endocrine, and respiratory systems (Harmon O'Driscoll et al., 2022 ). Different membranes have been implemented for the management of pesticides in wastewater. The RO membranes were applied for the remediation of water from pesticides (Irgarol, tributyl phosphate, dicofol and flutriafol) from wastewater (Goh et al., 2022 ). The rejection of the applied membranes showed high efficiency (>95%). BW30-LE membrane showed the maximum rejections for irgarol (98.3%), and tributyl phosphate (99.0%) while the GE-AD membrane recorded the highest rejection for flutriafol (99.9%) and dicofol (99.1%). The performances of the membranes are controlled by the characteristics of the pesticides (Hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, molecular weight and projection area) while it doesn't impact by the increase in transmembrane pressures (Ates et al., 2022 ). Removal of pesticides by RO and nanofiltration is governed by the composition and properties of pesticides. The main mechanism of removal is sieving followed by the affinity of pesticide for the membrane. The nanofiltration can remove most of the toxic contaminants, and it should integrate with other treatment steps such as activated carbon, electro-Fenton and advanced oxidation process, and photocatalytic processes. However, further integration with other processes is preferable (Plakas and Karabelas, 2012 ).• SDG15: Life on land     The biological diversity and healthy ecosystems strengthen the sources of water, food, shelter, medicine, and many other materials as well as provide ecosystem services. Irresponsible human activities changed most of the terrestrial ecosystems. For example, around 40,000 species are expected to be at risk of extinction soon, 10 million hectares of forest have been destroyed yearly and considerable biodiversity areas is still unprotected. To prevent the aggressive degradation of such ecosystems, numerous countries protected sites critical to biodiversity, and forced legislation and policies (Nations). Contaminated wastewaters discharged from numerous industrial plants threaten the sustainability of life on land, and the efficient treatment of this wastewater before discharge is of significant importance. Implementation of membrane-based technologies in the treatment and reusing of this water could significantly improve life on land. Among the energy and water co-generation techniques, the hybrid systems that consist of MD, RO, and PRO membranes possess a high potential for lower environmental footprints and sustainability (Yusuf et al., 2020 ). For example, oil-produced water is an important by-product of oil and gas exploration. With the increasing need for energy globally owing to the increasing population growth, petroleum oil is still the main source of energy worldwide. This wastewater contains numerous inorganic and organic compounds such as heavy metals, dissolved salt, and grease as well as dissolved and dispersed oils, which are toxic to human health and ecosystems. Therefore, there is an increasingly scientific focus on the management of such industrial wastewater not only to increase safe water resources but also to lower the negative effects on the ecosystems and environment. Owning to the huge quantities and complexity of this type of wastewater, the current treatment technologies such as evaporation, coagulation-flocculation, floatation, and adsorption are insufficient as a sole system and they are restricted to manage emulsified oil with high droplet size (>10 μm) (Zhu et al., 2014b ; Dickhout et al., 2017 ). To overcome this challenge and to break down the oil emulsion, chemical treatment and additional electric field are implemented. However, the extra treatment processes have negatively impacted the environment as well as they are energy-intensive (Saad et al., 2019 ). To overcome these challenges, membrane filtration has been applied owning to its efficiency and cost-effective characteristics (Baker, 2012 ). Ceramic and polymeric membranes recorded promising results for the separations of emulsions, silts and oils (Ebrahimi et al., 2009 ). The possibility to integrate membrane filtration with other technologies enhances the overall efficiency and increases its wide implementation (Samuel et al., 2022b ). Other membrane-based technologies such as nanofiltration, microfiltration, ultrafiltration and RO are also tested for the management of oil-produced water. The possibility to combine such technologies with others increases their reliability and applicability and also they generate effluent met the environmental legislative laws (Samuel et al., 2022b ).• SDG17: Partnership for the goals    Developing countries are facing numerous challenges such as economic recovery, water scarcity, pandemics, pollution, etc. To rescue the SDGs, an action plan is needed, along with audit procedures and restricted policies. International collaboration is also required. Reusing and recycling water has been viewed as one of the key strategies for achieving sustainability globally. By 2030, the world should improve water quality by controlling the release of dangerous chemicals and materials, reducing pollution, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater, banning dumping, and significantly increasing recycling and safe reuse globally. Hence, an international collaboration between countries should expand capacity-building assistance between developed and developing countries in water and sanitation-related activities (Ahmad et al., 2022 ).  4 Impact of membrane-based water and wastewater treatment technologies on circular economy 4.1 Reusing The contribution of membrane-based technologies to a circular economy mainly depends on waste minimization, reuse or recycling. Fouling is the main challenge towards membrane reusing and to overcome this obstacle, different solutions have been proposed such as etching the polyamide layer of the fouled or exhausted membranes using strong oxidizing agents to convert them to ultrafiltration or nanofiltration (Landaburu-Aguirre et al., 2016 ; Moradi et al., 2019 ). The efficiency of this regeneration process is depending on the nature and characteristics of the applied polyamide. Different approaches have been investigated to minimize, reuse and recycle the membranes. The main aims are to assess the carbon footprint of the fouled membranes and to minimize the environmental impacts (Lawler et al., 2012 ). Reusing the exhausted membranes for ultrafiltration or nanofiltration rather than developing a new one is studied. Recycling options, calorific recovery, and common disposal via incineration have been also proposed. It was reported that the reusing approach has the least environmental effect. For example, etching the active layers of the fouled/exhausted RO membranes with a strong oxidizer such as KMnO4  reduced the performance of the salt rejection. Hence, the cleaning and backwashing processes should carry out regularly to maintain efficient separation (Veza and Rodriguez-Gonzalez, 2003 ). Fouled or/and damaged RO membrane could fulfil the circular economy requirements via reusing as a supporting matrix for recycled anion exchanger membrane with permselectivity up to 87%, which is close to the commercial anion-exchange membranes, and via recovery of some valuable components such as polypropylene from it (Yusuf et al., 2020 ). Beside their recycling into anion exchange membranes, polypropylene components could be used for the assembly of an electrodialysis where 51% of the exhausted module can be recycled into an electrodialysis membrane composed of 54% of recycled components. The recycled membranes has been examined by brackish water desalination, the results of the assembled electrodialysis stack, showed salt removal up to 84.5%. Recycling of wasted RO membranes, eliminting their disposal in landfills and transferred membrane-based technologies into the circular economy (Lejarazu-Larrañaga et al., 2020 ).  4.2 Cleaning/regeneration Fouled or/and damaged RO membrane could fulfil the circular economy requirements via reusing as a supporting matrix for recycled anion exchanger membrane with permselectivity up to 87%, which is close to the commercial anion-exchange membranes, and via recovery of some valuable components such as polypropylene from it. The scheduled cleaning of the membrane is critical to enhance performance and longetivity of RO membranes. Results from recent studies proved that the use of chemical reagents is acceptable as a cleanup technology. However, the effectiveness of chemical cleaning is a function of foulant nature, characteristics of the reagent, physicochemical characteristics inclusive temperature of the solution and the aeration period (Ebrahim, 1994 ). Soda cleaning solution has been effectively applied in diary wastewater treatment; leading to a reduction in suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand and other organic contaminant indicators. Regular cleaning is known to reduce pH effect, effluent discharge water and energy loss (Dresch et al., 2001 ). Membrane cleaning/regeneration is important to ensure stable operation over time and increase lifetime of the membrane. There are different physical ad chemical cleaning techniques that have been employed in membrane cleaning. Chemical cleaning could recover 100% of the initial distillate flux and prevent pore wetting without compromising the mechanical stability of the membrane. The main chemicals used in membrane cleaning are tap and deionized waters, alkaline such as sodium hydroxide and acids such as cetric acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, formic acid, hydrochloric acid, and oxalic acid. However repeated cleaning result in surface wetting and surface polymer breakdown. Physical cleaning techniques are also used to prevent performance deterioration. These include air backwashing, aeration, vibration/ultrasound, and water flushing. The challenge is that the reject stream will become contaminated as a result of chemical treatments, such as those using chlorine or acids, which might increase the expense of treating or disposing of it. Further research on employing green cleaning products is necessary because there are still certain issues relating to membrane damage. Aeration and backwashing are physical ways that do not have this problem, although they may not be as efficient and will increase the energy required for the separation process (Abdel-Karim et al., 2021 ).  4.3 Biodegradable membrane Biodegradable polymers typically come from three sources: plant, animal, and synthetic. Biodegradable polymers include polylactide, poly (lactide-co -glycolide), polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), chitosan/chitin, collagen and sericin, lignin, alginate, cellulose acetate, starch, poly (vinyl alcohol), poly (butylene succinate), poly (plant- or vegetable-based polymers include starch, lignin, alginate, cellulose acetate, PLA, PLGA, and PHAs. Sericin and collagen are derived from animals. Resources from both plants and animals can be used to produce CS and CT. The synthetic biodegradable polymers PBS, PCL, and PPF are a few examples. It has shown that the use of these materials is expanding quickly (10–20% annually. Although biodegradable polymers have a wide range of uses, their utilization is constrained by a number of issues. The biodegradable polymers are occasionally combined with other polymers to get the desired characteristics. When a non-biodegradable plastic is used for blending, the biodegradable polymer will break down and the non-biodegradable plastics will be transformed into little molecules that cause environmental pollution. The rate of biodegradation is yet another serious issue. The application for which the polymer is to be used, its crystallinity, lamellar thickness, and molecular conformation, as well as various biotic and abiotic variables in various environments, all affect the intended biodegradation rate. Degraded materials can also dissolve in water and impact humans and the environment (Bandehali et al., 2021 ).  4.4 New generation Recent research efforts have been synthesized new generation of membranes to improve antifouling cheacterstics, produce high recovery flux and lower the required energy such as.• The antifouling membranes: A new generation of membranes including hybrid nanocomposite membranes, organic modifier and interfacial polymerization and acid monomers.  • Membrane surface modification: Two routes are included; (a) physical surface modification where polyelectrolytes or surfactants are adsorbed onto the membrane surface or the surface is coated with hydrophilic polymers to enhance the electrostatic repulsion of foulants, increasing membrane fouling and (b) chemical modification is occurred by reacting the membrane with active functional groups which increased the fouling (Landaburu-Aguirre et al., 2016 ).  • Synthesis of membranes using green polymers and solvents: there are concerns about the life cycle of membranes that are prepared by expensive polymers deue to their major environmental footprint. Nano polymer membrane has been prepared from the residual waste generated by green synthesis of nano particles. This development forms part of the advances in the use of membrane technology to reduce contaminants in industrial wastewater and environmental waste before ingress into water courses (Ravi et al., 2023 ). An eco-friendly technique in replacing non-renewable membrane materials with renewable fit; aimed at reducing hazardous materials in the chemical applications of membrane technology and processes has been reinterated. Herein, green solvents have been applied the generation of polymeric membranes. The selection of green solvents as a substitute for improper and toxic ones is critical in the realization of eco-friendly future progress in the membrane technology arena (Naziri Mehrabani et al., 2022 ). A solvent induced polymerization technique has been deployed to enhance the production of a uniformly porous, crystalline and structurally stable polyumer. This fit holds useful prospect in the water and wastewater treatment (Wu et al., 2022 ).     4.5 Recovery of nutrients and valuble materials Strategies for circular economy are not only based on membrane recycling and reusing. However, water reclamation using these membrane as well as recovery of nutrients and other valuble materials from wastewatwer is another aspect of circular ecomony. It is worthy to note that the application of treated water are mostly impacted by policy rather than economic and technical reasons. This is attributed to that the decision makers often do not have enough information about the effects of reusing treated wastewater in agriculture. So, putting national regulations for water reuse is of high importance (Mannina et al., 2022 ).   5 Barriers and challenges facing the development of membrane-based water and wastewater technologies It comes as a surprise that there is a limited water supply to meet industrial, agricultural, and domestic needs. Hence, water supply companies and relevant stakeholders have resorted to wastewater treatment generated from the previous activities. Summing it up, membrane technology is critical in wastewater treatment due to its efficacy (Ahmad et al., 2020 ). Also, membrane wastewater treatment is a relatively low-pressure process that produces water of satisfactory physical characteristics. Meaning, that these processes achieve low viral load, low microbial load, low turbidity discharge, and low organic contaminant indicators. As a matter of fact, these qualities are due to the decent structural, thermal and chemical solidity of these membrane filters. However, environmental and health implications of inadequate waste disposal regulatory framework still exist (Huang et al., 2018 ; Hakami et al., 2020 ). Given the mentioned setbacks, the bacterial and viral load reduction from wastewater means they must handle using proper COSH procedures. Unfortunately, the presence of these loads may account for photochemical oxidants are hazardous atmospheric pollutants. Also, the disposal of polyethene and propylene-based membrane filters that are non-reusable remains an unanswered question in the water industry. To add to it, fouling and high energy usage is critical issues which require resetting (Ahmed et al., 2022 ). It comes as no surprise that a continuously running process requires energy to complete the cycle. Indeed, this extra cost has posed several questions about the relevance of wastewater treatment for reuse or before discharge into the environment. To add to it, membrane fouling has created a considerable setback in this technology. Unfortunately, the reversible or irreversible clogging of the membrane pores creates fouling from total suspended solids, microbial organisms, and organic materials. These emerging contaminants that evade analytical detection. Now, group parameters are used as contaminant indicators of water quality. Therefore, there is a need to provide improved analytical tools and processes to capture them before the roll over to 2030 (Table 1  ). Small wonder that clogging creates a decrease in permeate flux. So, irreversible membrane fouling is critical in membrane technology and some cleanup techniques exist for the recovery of membrane surfaces. Fortunately, these processes include manual cleanup, episodic back flushing, ultrasonic cleaning, sponge ball cleaning and chemical cleaning. It is important to note that eco-friendly techniques are required. Crowning it all, there is a need to introduce chambers in the reactors loaded with activated carbons of different particle size fractions and spacing between these chambers and the membrane filter point. Subsequently, this arrangement automatically holds back all contaminants from the membrane filter. This arrangement plays a vital role in activated carbon regeneration and reusing them for subsequent cleanup processes (Obotey Ezugbe and Rathilal, 2020 ). Indeed, there are efforts to produce membrane filters and additives which would increase the aggregation of particulate matter and reduce membrane fouling. However, these additives are chemically engineered and are not eco-friendly and economical in characteristics. Finally, the industry would need to find eco-friendly energy alternatives and recyclable strategies for the toxic waste generated by membrane filtration techniques. The cost of water/wastewater treatment and desalination are major drivers for the wide implementation of membrane-based technologies in a large scale (Goh et al., 2020 ). The biggest parameter in terms of this technology economics in energy demand, especially RO desalination. For example, the production of one cubic meter of freshwater, the recent RO plant typically requires 3–4 kWh of electrical energy. Morever, seawater pressurization requires considerable energy. Another major barrier is associated with membranes that implies pressure, is the greenhouse gases emissions as well as the other contaminants into the air, which may promote climate change. However, integrating these technologies with renewable energy will answer this problem and implementing recycled/alternative materials for producing these membranes is also preferable (Garg and Jain, 2022 ). Due to the huge potential of renewable resource-driven RO desalination facilities to fulfil water demand while minimizing CO2  emissions, the idea of using renewable resources is appealing, and the number of research is expanding as a result. Desalination facilities have all been investigated as potential energy sources for solar, geothermal, and wind energy. However, several technological obstacles related to resource stability and construction costs need to be removed before widespread applications may be used (Eggensperger et al., 2020 ). It is crucial to evaluate potential environmental risks involved in membrane fabrication and during the procedures to justify ethical challenges associated with membrane implementation. There are two different categories of potential environmental effects: direct and indirect. However, desalination has a direct impact on the environment. In the case of desalination, the input of saltwater has a direct impact that, when introduced close to a desalination plant, significantly reduces aquatic species. Membrane processes can disrupt the environment, particularly marine creatures if the discharge is not properly managed. Particularly RO plants' brine discharge with high total dissolved solid levels has detrimental environmental effects. It has been determined that the Ashkelon desalination plant is one of the biggest facilities in the world. It receives about 315 million m3  of seawater each month and discharges brine with a TDS that is roughly twice that of saltwater. The choice of materials, regulatory enforcement tactics, and process intensification can all significantly reduce the environmental threat on the worldwide scale. In the case of desalination, the intake of saltwater results in a considerable decline in aquatic species when brought close to the desalination plant, which is the direct effect. Membrane processes can disrupt the environment, particularly marine creatures, if the discharge is not properly managed. Particularly RO plants' brine discharge with high TDS levels has a significant negative impact on the environment. It has been determined that the Ashkelon desalination plant which is one of the biggest facilities in the world, receives about 315 million m3  of seawater each month and discharges brine with a TDS that is roughly twice that of saltwater. The choice of materials, regulatory enforcement tactics, and process intensification can all significantly reduce the concern for the environment on a worldwide scale. The use and development of membrane manufacturing are growing. A large performance improvement is provided by adding nanoparticles as additives to the manufacture of membranes (Garg and Jain, 2022 ). Membrane technology and processes remain the industrial choice in the treatment of water and wastewater. In accounting for the UN philosophy of a circular economy, there is a need for the development of membranes that are reusable in surface and groundwater treatment. However, morphological differences exist in the membranes that are being used. These differences threaten the sustainability of the technology. The morphological setbacks indirectly affect the economic and environmental settings in the sector. The high cost is still being recorded in operating and maintenance cost. Alternative sources of cheaper and renewable energy to reduce energy consumption is critical to the sustainability of the energy and wastewater treatment sectors (Inayat et al., 2010 ; Shahbaz et al., 2020 ; Osman et al., 2021 ). The use of membranes with similar morphology in the treatment of water and wastewater with differing quality is not sustainable (Chia et al., 2021 ). The notorious problem of membrane fouling is stemed from morphological challenges posed by the membranes i.e. the geometry and nature of the membrane constituents. In addition, the longetivity, porosity and permeability factors are critical negatives that threaten the use of this technology in water and wastewater treatment. There are some eco-friendly chemicals amenable in the cleanup proceses including hydrogen peroxide and free nitrous acid. However, treating large industrial-scale water and wastewater for cities and communities to meet the SDGs dealine is not sustainable (Wen et al., 2022 ).  6 Future prospects There has been a generic applications of membrane-based technologies in water purification, wastewater treatment, water reuse, and desalination. These technologies have been applied independently or integrated with other technologies. Herein, seawater salt removal membrane procedures include RO, MD, FO, UF and NF. Membrane nature and operational characteristics remain salient factors in the sustainable application of membrane technologies. There is evidence of increased permeation rate and salt reduction in the use of membrane technology. However, membrane engineering leading to sustainable pores defined for the passage of specific contaminants is critical for enhanced recovery and regeneration. The emergence of polymer and nano-based membrane technology has created a pathway for its applications in different fields. In addition, there is a need to engineer membrane filters which are chemically and thermally stable for use in the industrial effluent cleanup. Also, some of the critical issues include a lack of monitoring of water quality and access to alternative water treatment strategy which aligns with membrane technology. No doubt, benefits in the use of membrane technology exist. However, critical issues outstanding include clogging of membrane pores, selective removal of contaminants, an ionic effect due to charging of membrane environment and high recovery of treated feed. The purification carried out in the water sector has received support from membrane technology. This technology has provided simple and low-cost techniques critical in industrial applications. The applications of membrane technology in the energy sector includes renewable energy production and fuel cell application. However, membrane technology performance in this regard is hindered by membrane accessory availability. These accessories should be synthetic materials which promote increased thermal and chemical capacities. Finally, the application of membrane technology creates an opportunity for environmental sustainability in the water and energy sectors. The challenge remains that the scientific and technological domain requires synergy to develop eco-friendly and simple hybrid processes to match the challenges (Roy and Ragunath, 2018 ). In the future, extensive research is needed to capture the gaps identified and progressively enhance technologies which depend less on the chemical and biological engineering of modern membrane filters. The introduction of activated carbon chambers of variable particle size fractions coupled with green energy technology could be used to treat fouled membranes intended for reuse. In addition, membrane components should be optimally cost effect for reuse and recycling (Yusuf et al., 2020 ). Much more studies on introducing artificial intelligence, modeling, 3D and 4D printing to membrane-based technologies are required (Yusuf et al., 2020 ).  7 Conclusion The current trends in membrane-based water and wastewater treatment technologies have been discussed in this review, along with their merits and challenges. These topics are reviewed to highlight the contribution of membrane-based water and wastewater treatment technologies to the achievement of SDGs and their role in the circular economy. The main conclusions of this study are reported as follows.• The membrane-based water/wastewater treatment technologies have numerous applications in water reuse, water treatment, wastewater remediation, desalination, food industry, biofuel, and value-added materials production.  • The main membrane processes are microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration and forward- and reverse-osmosis. The integration between two or more of the membrane processes are preferable to overcome the limitation of each process, conserve energy demand, and increase the overall performance efficiency.  • The increasing interest in such processes arises from their simplicity, low environmental impact, and high selectivity.  • The membrane-based technologies in water/wastewater treatment directly impact 15 SDGs out of 17.  • The major contribution of membrane-based technologies in the circular economy significantly depends on the reuse, recycling, and minimization of membranes.  • The main challenges towards the wide applications of such technologies at large scale are the high initial cost, the high energy requirements, as well as the membrane fouling.
