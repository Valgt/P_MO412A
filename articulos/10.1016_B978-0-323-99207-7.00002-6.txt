               In terms of the global awareness of anthropogenic climate change, the need to reduce the risk of disasters and to provide sustainable prosperity for all people, 2015 was a momentous year as three major global agreements were universally adopted to address these matters. In this chapter the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) associated with these agreements, especially those dealing with the elimination of extreme poverty and the provision of global prosperity, are discussed within the context of how engineering could contribute to making the goals achievable. To gain an appreciation of the requirements, the tasks that need to be undertaken, and the challenges to be overcome in satisfying the desired SDGs outcomes, are explained, followed by examples of how sustainable engineering could help. It is highlighted that not all technical or cultural aspects of engineering are sustainable, and they may never be, at least in the foreseeable future.

Chapter 1 Engineering sustainable development—Realizing the UN's sustainable development goals G.T. Reader  Department of Mechamical, Automotive and Materials Engineering, University of Windsor, Ontario, Canada Department of Mechamical, Automotive and Materials Engineering, University of Windsor Ontario Canada  Department of Mechamical, Automotive and Materials Engineering, University of Windsor, Ontario, Canada   In terms of the global awareness of anthropogenic climate change, the need to reduce the risk of disasters and to provide sustainable prosperity for all people, 2015 was a momentous year as three major global agreements were universally adopted to address these matters. In this chapter the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) associated with these agreements, especially those dealing with the elimination of extreme poverty and the provision of global prosperity, are discussed within the context of how engineering could contribute to making the goals achievable. To gain an appreciation of the requirements, the tasks that need to be undertaken, and the challenges to be overcome in satisfying the desired SDGs outcomes, are explained, followed by examples of how sustainable engineering could help. It is highlighted that not all technical or cultural aspects of engineering are sustainable, and they may never be, at least in the foreseeable future.   Keywords Sustainability  Sustainable development  Sustainable engineering   1.1 Introduction Twenty-fifteen (2015CE1  1 CE means the common era and is now generally used in preference to the suffix AD—Anno Domini. The remaining yearly dates used in this chapter should be assumed as referring to the common era.  ) was a pivotal year for United Nations’ resolutions with almost universal adoption by its member states of the Paris Agreement on Climate (UNFCCC, 2015 ), the Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations, 2015a ), and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (United Nations, 2015b ). However, although each resolution has separate, associated publications there are many links and commonalities between the three, such as climate change, sustainable development, and the eradication of global poverty. By climate change, the United Nations (UN) means anthropogenic climate change in accordance with the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC), that is, “Climate change means a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods” ( UNFCCC, 2015  ) . Natural causes which alter local, regional, or global weather patterns in the short-term or on a temporary basis, for example, a few days to perhaps a year or so, are referred to as climate variabilities. However, depending upon the frequency of such events, that is, volcanic eruptions, periodic or seasonal changes in ocean and atmospheric circulations, wildfires caused by lightning strikes, hurricanes etc., it could mean that their individual influences are more pronounced in some periods than others. How are changes in climate determined? In the 20th century, it was recommended by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) that weather patterns over a 30-year period should be analyzed to discover if there was a change in climate and, if so, what caused those changes (WMO, 2017 ). The number may appear somewhat arbitrary but when the system was instigated there were only 30 years of data available. Although the 30-year approach remains in place, recent studies suggest that such a timeframe “is not generally the optimal averaging period ” (WMO, 2018 ). By this it is meant that a 30-year average is too long for accurate surface temperature predictions but not long enough for acceptable precipitation projections (WMO, 2018 ). Yet, these two factors are used by WMO in their modeling processes for accurately predicting future climate changes. However, in an effort to describe changing climates, without “reducing climate change to only temperature ,” the WMO collect data on what they describe as “relevant domains of climate change ,” namely temperature and energy, atmospheric composition, ocean and water, and the cryosphere.2  2 Places on Earth where water is in its solid form, that is, frozen.   The data come from measurements of a set of 7 key parameters identified as Global Climate Indicators, see Fig. 1.1   (WMO, 2021 ). It will be noticed that while surface temperature is one of the chosen indicators, precipitation is not apparently being considered as one of the subsidiary indicators. Maybe because of this situation WMO have continued with their 30-year approach. The WMO indicators are examples of the indicators and indexes that have been largely developed in the 21st century to measure, but also to inform the public and policymakers, the state of particular human rights as elucidated in the original “United Nations Declaration of Human Rights,” and subsequent global agreements, dealing not only with the environment but also with the right to clean water, adequate food, adequate housing, and so on. What were considered human needs for survival are now specified as human rights by the member states of the UN, although surprisingly the need for clean air is absent from the lists of human rights. Nevertheless, decades before what may be described as this era of universal sustainable development goals and the formulation of measurable means of tracking progress, several indicators, and indexes, had been developed to indicate the local, national, and international environmental, climatic and societal situations being experienced, such as the Global Hunger Index (GHI), the Water Scarcity Index, the Air Quality Index (AQI), and so on (Air Now (n.d.) June 28, 2022 ; Damkjaer & Taylor, 2017 ; Global Hunger Index, 2022 ). To these pre-2015 indexes and indicators, which are still in use, further indicators have been added, including 248 SDG indicators some of which overlap so that only 231 are unique (United Nations, 2022a ). These particular indicators are associated with the 17 goals, and the 169 targets (126 national and 43 international) of the SDGs identified and defined in the UN 2015  publication “Transforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” (United Nations, 2015a ). The Sendai Framework has 38 indicators to measure the progress toward its seven goals, of which Goal G states: “Substantially enhance international cooperation to developing countries through adequate and sustainable support, ” while the Paris Agreement, which consists of 29 Articles, and is often portrayed as a commitment solely to holding increases in the global average temperature to below 2°C, includes several other international pledges with the objective, “to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty ” (UNFCCC, 2015 ; United Nations, 2015b ). So, why are all these indicators and indexes now required and why have they been formulated, especially in the 21st century, to measure human progress? Arguably, the global community has become more altruistic and humanitarian since the founding of the UN and, particularly over the last three decades, with worldwide extreme poverty being reduced at the same time as access to electricity has increased, see Figs. 1.2   and 1.3   (Ritchie, Roser, & Rosado, 2020 ; Roser & Ortiz-Ospina, 2019 ). Nevertheless, over 940 million people, almost three times the population of the United States, do not have access to electricity, 6.5 billion exist on less than $30 US per day, and more than 600 million live in extreme poverty on a daily income of less than $1.90 US. The richer countries, as measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, have greater access to electricity and far lower levels of poverty than poorer countries. However, in adopting UN's Agenda 2030, the member states pledged to ensure the principle of, that is, “no one will be left behind ” (LNOB) and to “endeavour to reach the furthest behind first ” (United Nations, 2015b ). The UN's LNOB is reminiscent of the U.S. Military's “sacred” commitment to “leave no one behind on the battlefield” (Bjorkman, 2020 ). The general public may not be wholly aware of the association of Agenda 2030 with the LNOB mantra, but all of the SDGs include the codicil “for all.” While the humanitarian approach embedded in the three 2015 resolutions will likely provide a high level of comfort to many in modern society it has taken some time for such attitudes to come to fruition. The same could be said for altruism which, when used as a societal ethical tenet, means that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others. Are these adopted principles because of a widespread shift in universal cultural values or could it be because it is now realized that rapid population growth and an increasingly aged population have magnified the challenges that global society faces everywhere and makes action by all for all necessary? Based on the data presented in recent years by such organizations as “Our World in Data,” the “World Bank” and the UN's various agencies, the world overall is, arguably, becoming healthier, wealthier, and better connected (International Committee of the Red Cross, 2018 ). So, perhaps a global cultural shift is taking place but perhaps not as, according to recent authoritative reports, the rates of humanitarian help are insufficient, not improving, and richer nations are not fulfilling their commitments to help poorer nations (International Rescue Committee, 2022 ). Regardless of the precise reasons for the global improvements that have been witnessed, which continue to be debated by social science and humanities researchers, there can be no argument that there has been a spectacular rise in global population especially since 1760 (usually credited as being the start of the first Industrial Revolution) to 2018, and which is projected to continue until the end of this century, (Fig. 1.4 )  (Roser, Ritchie, & Ortiz-Ospina, 2019 ). Indeed, there are now more than 12 people on Earth for each one living in 1760 and by 2100 the ratio will be over 14:1, albeit the rate of growth has been declining since the late 1960s. Moreover, the global average life expectancy has increased by over 150% from 1770 to 2019, 28.7 years to 72.6 years, respectively (Roser, Ortiz-Ospina, & Ritchie, 2019 ). Although, the focus of this rest of this chapter are discussions about the possible connections between Sustainable Engineering and its various roles in achieving the SDGs, or at least some of the more obvious Agenda 2030 goals and targets, the overlaps with the Paris Agreement and Sendai Framework commitments are ignored especially in instances where there could be conflicting engineering requirements, for example, access to affordable energy and imposition of a renewable only approach. It is also highlighted that for many facets of engineering, embracing the philosophy of sustainability is counter to the long-held approach, particularly in the manufacturing industries, of planned obsolescence which has been prevalent since the arrival of commercial electric light bulbs (Hadhazy, 2016a ). Society in general, has doggedly used a “make-use-discard” mindset and Engineering is no exception. Nonetheless, for many reasons, including the increasing demands of population growth and the exhaustion of critical natural materials, this mentality itself needs to be discarded. But how and by what will it be replaced if no one is to be left behind? One answer appears to be by adoption of sustainable development, as originally defined in what has become known as the Brundtland report in 1987, that is, “to make development sustainable to ensure that it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs ” (Brundtland, 1987 ). After decades of discussion following the submission of the report, UN member states endorsed a plan outlined in their Millennium Declaration of 2000 involving 8 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which formed the basis in 2015 for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 goals (Bettelli, 2021 ; United Nations, 2000 ). To achieve sustainable development in the form proposed by Brundtland requires a myriad of issues to be considered, not least of which is the need to provide appropriate formative education and training in all academic and professional disciplines. The majority of the targets and indicators of the 15-year plan embedded in the Agenda 2030 SDGs now only have a further 8 years to be fulfilled. Will this short time-span be sufficient to meet the Agenda's objectives? It appears not according to the performance tracking methodologies devised for the assessment of the progress toward the goals (United Nations, 2021a ). Is this because Engineering has not been as responsive to the needs of sustainable development as many would have expected or because the roles of Engineering in such endeavors have not been fully annunciated? To tackle these questions, it is considered necessary to identify how many SDG factors are directly impacted by engineering and, conversely, how do they impact the practice of engineering? In the following section the Agenda SDGs are described along with their possible connections to Engineering. Subsequently, the challenges and barriers facing the engineering community are discussed, as well as some observations regarding the response of the community to these hurdles.  1.2 What are the SDGs and how are they monitored? Every SDG has a defined a goal. For example, SDG 6 is to: “Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all ” (United Nations, 2021b ). Associated with each goal are a number of targets that collectively, if met, are meant to make sure that the goal is achieved. To determine if the targets are met, they each have one or more indicators. The targets, and the accompanying specific indicators, are aimed separately at national realization and international accomplishments, as shown in Table 1.1   (United Nations, 2022a ). Overall, there are 126 national targets and 43 international targets. These targets are linked to 248 indicators of which only 231 are unique as some indicators are repeated for use with two or three different targets, albeit with slightly altered wording. Indicators are reviewed annually resulting in some being added, others deleted, and definitions amended, so the exact number of indicators changes. There are also 5-year comprehensive reviews of the indicator framework which can also lead to revisions. Although, as mentioned in the Introduction, the majority of SDGs are to be achieved by 2030 it should be noted that in Table 1.1  the SDG numbers followed by an asterisk (*) also have targets with a deadline of 2025, or that should have been achieved by 2020. For example, SDG target 3.6 was by 2020 to “halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents ,” the associated indicator to be used, 3.6.1, being the death rate due to road traffic injuries. Another example of an earlier deadline is that part of SDG 8.7 target is to “by 2025, end child labour in all its forms ” (United Nations, 2022b ). Regardless of any particular deadline for satisfying the goals, targets, and indicators, without a meaningful way of measuring the indicators it will not be possible to gauge the progress being made in meeting the aims of Agenda 2030 (United Nations, 2022c ). Hence, to determine if targets are being achieved, whether with timelines of 2020, 2025 or 2030, the related indicators have to be measured regularly and then analyzed. The methodology for collecting and collating the indicator data has to adhere to the UN's Statistical Commission (UNSD) standards, the governing body for the whole of the global statistical system, which are given in the UN's “Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics” (UNSD, 2022 ) (UNSD, 2013 ). Among other responsibilities with respect to national and international data gathering for such matters as the global economy, population, environment etc., for particular initiatives, the UNSC also makes further recommendations on how the assembled data should be quantified. For instance, in the Agenda 2030 document not only are the SDG indicators identified but a recommendation is also provided that indicators “should be disaggregated, where relevant, by income, sex, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability and geographic location, or other characteristics ” (United Nations, 2022a ). The collection of data concerning the 231 indicators and its subsequent disaggregation are huge tasks for any nation, especially those who may not have the wherewithal to perform undertakings. These issues are addressed by the UN as discussed in the next Section 1.2.1 . 1.2.1 Indicator classification and custodians The target indicators, eventually, should provide a wealth of data which will offer crucial insights into the state of the needs of humanity as LNOB becomes the global philosophy. In essence, scrutiny of the indicator results will provide “gap analyses” for all those political and professional bodies, such as the Engineering community, which are directly or indirectly involved in sustainable development. However, to ensure that the indicators were, and still are, universally applicable and acceptable a voluntary and country-led group, known as the Inter-Agency and Expert Group (IAEG) was formed in 2015, and tasked with developing and implementing the Agenda 2030’s SDG indicator framework (United Nations, 2022c ). The IAEG is sizeable with 27 members of national statistical offices plus an ex-officio chairperson and numerous expert observers providing multinational representation (United Nations, 2016 ). After just over 2 years of consultative effort the resulting IAEG document dealing with the framework was adopted by the General Assembly of the UN in July 2017 (United Nations, 2017 ). One crucial aspect identified in the IAEG-SDG submission was the need to qualify the standard of the methodologies to be used as many of the indicators had not been measured before on a regular basis or not at all. This resulted in the IAEG-SDG classifying measurement methodologies and data availability into three tiers (United Nations, 2022d ) (Table 1.2  ). Since 2017, regular reviews have resulted in some indicators being reclassified into a higher tier. Following the 2020 review, no indicators are now classified as Tier III, but presumably this could change in the future. It is then the IAEG who are responsible for defining the indicators and the class of methodology but, as discussed in the previous section, there is a tremendous amount of data to compile, collate and monitor, especially if global overviews are to be provided. To carry out these tasks the UN use a team of “Custodian Agencies” many of which are departments or organizations within the UN, such as the World Bank Group (WBG) and the World Health Organization (WHO). In addition, apart from the UN, other international agencies such the International Energy Agency (IEA), the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development [OCED] are also SDG indicator “custodians” (UN Economic Commission for Europe, 2018 ). Why these organizations? The OCED, for example, has 37 member countries together with 5 “key-partners” which between them represent about 80% of world trade and investment. They produce and publish about 500 major evidence-based reports annually on a range of topics of international interest from “Improving education systems ” to “Coordinating Health and Safety Testing ” and they also develop recommendations for international standards on such matters as Artificial Intelligence (OCED, n.d., June 28, 2022 ), (Wikipedia, 2022f ). In many ways they operate like a mini-UN organization but essentially OCED is an intergovernmental advocacy and lobbying group whose overall aim is to shape and promote, “better policies for better lives, ” meaning “prosperity, equality and well-being for all ” (OCED, n.d., June 28, 2022 ). Obviously, there is much commonality between the SDGs of Agenda 2030 and the work of the OCED. Moreover, as the OCED collect and analyze country-wide data, not just from their member countries and partners, their partnership with the UN's SDG mission is mutually beneficial. Altogether, there are 50 custodian agencies of which 70% are under the auspices of the UN, the remainder being non-UN organizations. Each custodian may have more than one indicator or target to monitor, and each target may have more than one monitoring custodian. The SDG 6, Clean Water and Sanitation, target monitoring progress involves 9 custodians for the 11 indicators, plus a number of “Partner” Agencies although 2 of the indicators where they are many custodians and partners are still considered to be Tier II. On the other hand, the target for SDG 13, Climate Action, had 13 custodians in 2018 but in 2022 had only three together with three partners. Maybe this is because there are too many custodians or the coordination among the particular custodians has been lacking, or maybe just the result of the annual and periodic comprehensive reviews? Whatever the reasons, the coordination of the inputs from the various custodians is crucial. The United Nations Statistical Division (UNSD) is tasked with the coordination role and the maintenance of the global SDG database. The progress toward the goals of Agenda 2030 is determined using both UN official statistics and those of other international organizations by the Global Change Data Lab, a registered charity in England and Wales. The progress data are presented in collaboration with Oxford University's “Oxford Martin Programme on Global Development through its open-access project Our World in Data,” which is acknowledged as the official SDG tracker (Ritchie, Roser, Mispy, & Ortiz-Ospina, 2018 ).  1.2.2 SDG indicator custodians Exemplars of the roles, by numbers of indicators, which particular custodians play in the comprehensive but somewhat intricate SDG tracking framework are given in Table 1.3  . All these custodians publish reports on a frequent basis as well as maintaining extensive websites. These provide more specific detail about particular topics than the more general SDG sites, for example the information provided in this reference (IEA, IRENA, UNSD, World Bank, WHO, 2022 ). Some of the custodian agencies’ information, in addition to SDG tracking, is also used on the very extensive “Our World in Data” website which covers an encyclopedic range of articles on almost 300 topics accompanied by more than 3000 charts of all types, dealing with the “progress against the world's largest problems ,” such as those associated with the use of illicit drugs (Our World in Data, 2022 ). This additional information can be very helpful in gaining a perspective of the issues the SDGs are attempting to address, especially because of the use of graphical visualization. A typical example is that for SDG target 6.1, which is to “achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all ” by 2030. However, before the COVID pandemic, that is, 2020, only 74% of the global population enjoyed such access, albeit an increase over the 70% with access at the start of the SDG era in 2015. If this rate of progress were continued in the 2020–2030 decade only 82% would have access by 2030 (Ritchie & Roser, 2021a ). This means that to meet the target a 3.2-fold rate of progress is needed globally. This necessary increase is probably now an underestimate for the remaining 8 years given the ravages of the pandemic. What are the likely ramifications of not achieving this increase? In 2017, according to an authoritative study, 1.2 million people died prematurely as a result of unsafe water, three times the number of global homicides and equal to the number of people who died in road accidents (Murray, 2018 ; Ritchie & Roser, 2021b ). It must be emphasized that the 3.2-fold increase in clean water access is for the world. Different rates of increase will be needed depending upon socio-economic, geographic location and projected population growth. This is to some extent evident on an Our World in Data graphical visualization of the progress made this millennium, including since 2015, for selected exemplars shown in Fig. 1.5   (Ritchie & Roser, 2021a ). In this chart it can be seen that North America, Europe and high-income countries are, in general, close to the 100% benchmark but at the current rates of progress it could be between 2040 and 2080 before the SDG target is reached3  3 Author calculations based on data to produce Fig. 1.5 .  . Similarly, low-income people and those living in sub-Saharan Africa will likely not achieve the target this century, or even the next, with the current rates of progress which, if not improved, could mean it will be at least 2120 before access to safe water for all becomes a reality. As engineers are significantly involved in the generation of safe water, they need to fully appreciate not only the coming challenges, but also take cognizance of the necessity to sustain the capabilities of present facilities. The information presented on the Our World in Data website deals not only with SDGs’ targets and indicators directly but also provides data that is helpful in furnishing the context for some of these measures. A typical example is SDG 2: “End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture ,” which has 10 national indictors, seven having a noticeable connection to agricultural land with one, indicator 2.4.1 being explicit: “Proportion of agricultural area under productive and sustainable agriculture .” With a growing global population, it could be implied that more agricultural land will be required but, as Fig. 1.6   shows, the world has already passed “peak agricultural land” (Ritchie, 2022 ). This means that to achieve indicator 2.4.1, regardless of technology advances such as driverless farming machinery, engineers working with farmers will need to provide innovative improvements to existing crop-growing methodologies.  1.2.3 Development pillars, the wedding cake, and SDG index Post-1945, concepts of global human development were based on two pillars, economic growth and social injustice, embracing elements of welfare state theory. To begin with economic growth was the main UN focus but after about three decades the disposition of the growing number of UN member states began to change. In due course these changing attitudes led to a UN sponsored Commission that investigated the link between human development and the global environment, and resulted in the adoption of a set of Millennium Development Goals aimed at providing solutions to human development problems in UN defined developing countries. By 2012, the vagaries of the failed attempts to have a universal system which ensured social, economic and environment benefits for all humans were becoming increasingly obvious. It was also recognized that, even if a successful system were to be developed, it would have to be sustainable. Subsequently, after 3 years of intense global discussions among member state governments and other groups representing non-UN national, international, and intranational communities the ambitious Agenda 2030 was formulated and adopted by 193 members of the UN General Assembly. 1.2.3.1 Origins of Agenda 2030 The origins and evolution of sustainable development, first as a concept and now as a global policy framework for human development, are relatively new. At the end of the Second World War, and with the formation of the UN to address the effects of the carnage, the destructive nature of such events and ensure future global peace and prosperity, the then senior member states of the UN considered that universal human development was the key to global rehabilitation, redemption, and a fairer distribution of wealth. Their initial guiding principles were to increase the global economy by encouraging and supporting growth and, where possible, strengthen social policies based on the welfare state concepts of equal opportunity, equitable distribution of resources, and public participation for all (Misachi, 2017 ). The thrust for enhanced human development was not a new idea but it was the first time that a global or multinational effect was to be attempted. The welfare state ideas were proposed in rudimentary form more than two millennia ago and elements of the concept were enacted by rulers and leaders in part to maintain control of the common people. Later, the basic approaches were targeted at protecting the economic and social well-being of their populations which would be funded by a government collected tax, known as “Zakat” when introduced as one of the five pillars of Islam in the seventh century (Misachi, 2017 ). There was little further development of the welfare system until the 19th century when a series of reforms began to appear in the United Kingdom dealing with the growing concerns among some politicians of the living standards of the so-called “industrial poor” that is, the workers. These concerns culminated in a whole series of government acts to address old-age pensions, free-school meals, and, in 1911, the national insurance act which arguably mimicked the Zakat scheme (Offer, 2018 ). However, the main impetus for the UK initiatives came from the welfare state type approaches being adopted in the late 19th century by the then new German Empire and other European countries such as Belgium and Switzerland (Wikipedia, 2022a ). By the early 1940s, a handful of countries or provincial jurisdictions, mainly European, adopted nation-wide unemployment insurance legislation either on a compulsory basis like the UK and Germany, or on a voluntary basis like Belgium and Switzerland (Social Security Administration, n.d. ). The United States developed a hybrid system to take cognizance of the complexities of their political governance issues between the Federal and State Governments. After the Second World War, an expansion of many of the facets of the welfare state, as adopted prewar by both the sides of the conflict, was universally promoted by the UN. In particular, the hope was that one of the results of economic growth would be a significant enhancing of government aid to individuals throughout their lives and the universal creation of social insurance systems to act as a monetary social safety net for those, who at particular times in their lives, could experience overwhelming financial privations. Consequently, as government revenues would generally increase some of these additional resources were to be used to provide the general public with access to “free” basic education and health services, pensions or improved pensions, and affordable housing (Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2020 ). In addition, those experiencing economic hardships due to unavoidable job loss, illness, or workplace injury, temporary or permanent, would receive government aid such as unemployment benefits, social security payments or workers' compensation to help protect them from financial harm. Human development was therefore to be based on “two pillars” social and economic. Most countries, but not all, embraced these philosophies to greater or lesser extents. In particular, religion and political ideology often influenced nations, and still do, on the scale of actions taken on the welfare state approach. Today, many people living in the richer countries, like Canada, expect a wide-range of social safety-nets including old-age security in addition to national pensions, assistance with housing repairs and increased energy efficiency, maternity leaves and child benefits to be readily available, albeit that the level of support received seldom meets expectations (Government of Canada, 2022 ). Moreover, in the immediate postwar years these modern social insurance benefits were probably viewed as revolutionary by both politicians and their citizens but in practice the adoption of welfare state notions became more evolutionary. Indeed, with populations growing rapidly, especially in the poorer countries, by the 1970s it was becoming increasingly apparent that the bulk of the economic growth meant that richer countries were becoming richer and the vision of a fairer global wealth distribution was not materializing (Meadows, Meadows, Randers, & Behrens, 1972 ). Major aspects of the wealth distribution issues were (a) the unbalanced exploitation of the natural resources and lower labor costs of the poorer countries by the richer countries, particularly, but not exclusively, the former colonial powers and (b) the lack of environmental stewardship and remediation. In the early 1980s, following the concerns expressed by the General Assembly of the UN, a World Commission on Environment and Development was established, with the Norwegian Prime Minister and former Minister for the Environment, Gro Harlem Brundtland, as Chair, tasked to formulate a “Global Agenda for Change.” In particular to (a) “propose long-term environmental strategies for achieving sustainable development by the year 2000 and beyond ,” and (b) “recommend ways concern for the environment may be translated into greater co-operation among developing countries and between countries at different stages of economical and social development and lead to the achievement of common and mutually supportive objectives ” (United Nations General Assembly, 1983 ). The Commission, often referred to as the Brundtland Commission, submitted their report in 1987 and the term “sustainable development” thus passed into the UN's lexicon. Their recommendations provided the momentum which eventually led to the adoption of the UN's 8 Millennium Development Goals of 2000 with a main commitment, Article 11, to “spare no effort to free our fellow men, women and children from the abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty ” (United Nations, 2000 ). The 16 targets associated with the 8 goals were to be achieved by 2015. Although some progress toward the goals was achieved there were mixed reactions to the MDG initiative as it was considered to be a top-down scheme whereby rich countries would provide aid and sustainable solutions to poorer developing countries. To some of the latter this approach smacked of continued exploitation and condescension. Moreover, the wealthier countries rarely addressed the needs of their own disadvantaged citizens nor involved the poorer nations or consulted other organizations in deciding what appropriate sustainable actions needed to be taken particularly in countries receiving aid. The MDGs appeared more concerned with the social injustice aspects of sustainable development but they did not have a defined scope to deal with the growing global economic bedlam and above all the continuing damage being experiencing by the environment. Taking cognizance of the feelings being expressed by many member states the UN called the 2012 Rio+20 conference on Sustainable Development. The upshot was a call for a more comprehensive set of universal goals, dealing with social, economic, and environmental problems and broader consultations on the issues and solutions (United Nations, 2012 ). The result was the involvement of over 10 Million participants, via a series of presentations, including nongovernment organizations (NGOs), trade unions, Indigenous, and women's groups, scientific and technology communities, and so on (University of New South Wales, 2020 ). Using the gathered feedback and numerous meetings among member states the UN announced Agenda 2030 containing the 17 SDGs (United Nations, 2015a ). There would be three pillars of development, now termed sustainable development, namely, social, economic, and environment associated with the SDGs. Various pictorial representations of the 3 pillars and the SDGs began to appear and the one which has gained iconic status is the so-called wedding cake by the Stockholm Resilience Center (Centre) with the three layers of SDGs as opposed to three pillars with “biosphere” replacing environment as shown in Fig. 1.7   (Rockström & Sukhdev, 2016 ).  1.2.3.2 The SDG index The latest SDG list identifies 248 indicators, 231 of which are unique (United Nations, 2022c ). With so many indicators with different, even agreed, methods of measurement, such as, “proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions ,” “maternal mortality rates ” or “participation rate of youth and adults in formal and non-formal education and training in the previous 12 months, ” how can the resulting diverse database of indicators be used to provide an all-round portrait of the progress toward the 17 SDGs and their targets (Sachs, Lafortune, Kroll, Fuller, & Woelm, 2022 )? Such a measure would be very useful as it could also highlight the efficacy of the national plans in selecting target priorities. However, in defining an overall SDG index it could be that a large change in one indicator would have less overall effect than a small change in a “weightier” indicator. Perhaps, an appreciation of the challenge of seeking an all-round index but also the obvious rewards of creating such a measure, can be illustrated by how the best all-round athletes are determined? Participants in the track and field competition known as the decathlon take part in 10 separate events. Their goal is to become the best “all-round athlete.”4  4 Originally a term used for a different multievent prior to the 1912 Olympic games.   Events involve running, jumping, and throwing, so the indicators of performance are time and distance, the latter involves released objects, for example, javelin, heavy weights, whereas jumping, vertical and horizontal, involves movement where the athlete's entire body is “temporarily airborne ” (Wikipedia, 2022b ). As there are obvious and significant differences in performance measures a points system is used whereby a maximum score of 1000 points are awarded for each event to provide an overall score of 10,000 points. Originally, the benchmark for achieving 1000 points was the world record in that event. This approach eventually proved to be unworkable as specialist athletes, not taking part in a decathlon, continued to improve world records for each of the events so formulae were introduced, based on the performance of actual decathlon athletes. Using the world record benchmark in modern times would mean that Jürgen Schult's current world record discus throw of just over 74 m would score 1383 points in a decathlon, as the best discuss throw by a decathlete is just under 56m for which the thrower received 993 points, albeit it is now possible to score over a 1000 points in an event because of the way modern performance thresholds are defined (Barrow, 2021 ; Wikipedia, 2022c ). This decathlon scoring system has evolved into a complex series of formulas which, by 2016, required a document of 182 pages to explain (Doyle, 2016 ). There have been suggestions for further changes to the system as it appears that mathematical nuances can play as significant a role as overall physical performance in determining the “best all-round athlete” that is, is it better for an athlete to focus on improving their running, jumping, or throwing performance (Barrow, 2021 )? It is highly unlikely that the developers of the SDG index used the decathlon system as their template, but the basic approach between the two do have similarities as the three-step procedure for calculating the SDG index illustrates. Namely, (a) “establish performance thresholds and remove extreme values ,” (b) normalization, that is, “rescale the data to ensure compatibility across indicators ,” and (c) “aggregate the indicators within and across SDGs ” (Sachs, Lafortune, Kroll, Fuller, & Woelm, 2022 ). For each indicator the optimum performance score is 100 and the worst performance score is 0 (zero). However, akin to the decathlon system, several countries may have already exceeded a SDG target benchmark, in which case the average of the top 5 performers is used and for all indicators as listed in (b) above each variable is rescaled from 0 to 100 (Sachs, et al., 2020 ). Arguably, the decathlon metaphor may be a useful teaching tool for introducing the SDG index. Details of the SDG index are now published in the annual Sustainable Development Report along with document linkages explaining how the index is calculated, although brief explanations are provided in the annexes of the reports (Sachs, Lafortune, Kroll, Fuller, & Woelm, 2022 ). As mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, not all countries have the capabilities to collect and disaggregate the indicator data to avoid, or at least minimize, biases. Because of missing data, the index only includes countries with populations greater than one million and where data is available for at least 80% of the SDG variables. However, there are two exceptions to this rule, “children involved in child labor ” and “exports of hazardous pesticides ” (Sachs, Lafortune, Kroll, Fuller, & Woelm, 2022 ). By no means perfect, the SDG index is a robust measure of the overall progress being made to achieve the SDG targets and the metadata contained within its constituent parts can help guide countries in the determination of their target priorities (United Nations, 2022b ). In assessing the contributions that sustainable engineering could, and should, make to realize the goals of Agenda 2030 the index and the associated metadata are indispensable, as discussed in the following sections. Although, the main focus of this chapter is the possible relationships between sustainable engineering and the sustainable development goals it would be remiss to overlook the usefulness of the other measures, mainly indexes, which have been developed by international organizations, for example, FAO, UNICEF, OWD, who have extensive data gathering and validation processes and, sometimes, major national agencies such as the United States Department of Energy (USDOE), Department of Housing and Urban Development (USHUD) and the Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA).5  5 Part of the US Department of the Interior.   Many of the indexes developed by such organizations and agencies provide further measures which, while not providing direct SDG indicator information, can be used to “impute6  6 A term used in by the UN in Sustainable Development reports.  ” that is, calculate, a similar progress-tracking statistic where exact or robust information is not available for a particular SDG indicator. The UN's Sustainable Development Solutions Network also uses other measures in determining sustainability progress such as information derived from sources like the Gallup® World Poll (Sustainable Development Solutions Network, n.d.). The world poll data can be used to identify groups of people to take part in particular surveys to determine, for example, the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) which, as the phrase implies, is a measure of how food insecurity is managed and as such is included in the SDG 2 indicators. Another example is the Happiness Index, reported annually since 2012 in the World Happiness report. Although the report itself is not officially endorsed by the UN, the use of the happiness concept is encouraged following the adoption by the UN's General Assembly in 2011 of resolution (65/309): “Happiness: Towards a holistic approach to development ” which urged governments to “give more importance to happiness and well-being in determining how to achieve and measure social and economic development ” (United Nations, 2011 ). Happiness is then a measure which impacts two of the pillars of sustainable development. The calculation of the happiness index also uses surveys and world poll data and analogous to amendments in SDG indicator definitions, slight changes are made to the happiness survey questions (Helliwell et al., 2022 ). However, although the happiness index is not directly used in calculation of SDG indicators or the SDG index it is becoming an acknowledged factor in assessing the adequacy of housing as part of the affordability criteria. Thus, in discussing sustainable engineering a broad range of social, economic, and environmental measurements, not just SDG indicators, need to be considered. But are these extraneous factors meaningful? The answer is, they can be. For example, in Table 1.4  , a comparison of the most recent SDG and Happiness index results are given for selected countries (Helliwell et al., 2022 ; Sachs, Lafortune, Kroll, Fuller, & Woelm, 2022 ). It can be seen that the “happiest” countries are also those making good progress in achieving the SDG targets whereas the least happy countries are those who have made little progress, but there are exceptions. For instance, the people of the United States and especially Iceland appear to be “happy” but their SDG target progress is not as good as may be expected. Now that the various means of identifying the targeted factors believed to be instrumental in achieving global sustainable development have been discussed, along with the methodologies developed to track and measure the impact of these factors, hopefully a solid foundation has been established for assessing and discussing the possible contributions of engineering to Agenda 2030.    1.3 Engineering for sustainability As this chapter is concerned with the sustainable development aspect of engineering, and its role in achieving the Agenda 2030 SDG targets, it was necessary to first provide the context for the possible relationships between engineering and the sustainable development goals. Thus, in Sections 1.1  and 1.2 , the SDGs, were identified and explanations provided on the targets of the individual goals and the measurements that are to be taken to determine the rate of progress toward these goals, that is, the target indicators. However, to develop a matrix of relationships between engineering and the SDGs is somewhat of a subjective task as the term “engineering” does not appear in any of the detailed descriptions of the goals, targets, and indicators, albeit that words “technology” and “science or scientific” are mentioned in several instances (United Nations, 2017 ). This is not too surprising since it has long been the case that awareness of the societal role of engineering in general, and in human development in particular, has not received the same level of attention or public and political acknowledgment as science (World Federation of Engineering Organizations, International Council of Academies of Engineering and Technological Sciences, International Federation of Consulting Engineers, UNESCO, 2010 ). The lack of attentiveness and acknowledgement regarding engineering is by no means a new phenomenon but a discussion on why this situation exists is out of the scope of this chapter. Suffice it to say that the relationships between engineering and sustainable development is as much by inference, some of which is obvious, as by definition. In discussing the likely connections between engineering and sustainable development a definition of sustainable engineering would be useful. However, as with a definition of sustainable development, there are a number of different versions, for example, “Sustainable engineering is the science of applying the principles of engineering and design in a manner that fosters positive social and economic development while minimizing environmental impact,”  but no universally accepted interpretation (Maier, 2022 ). Nevertheless, a characterization which appears to provide a commonly acceptable meaning of sustainable engineering comes from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), namely that sustainable engineering is “the process of using resources in a way that does not compromise the environment or deplete the materials for future generations ” (Oxford Summer Courses, 2022 ). In essence, this is a slight reworking of the original Brundtland sustainable development definition quoted earlier in Section 1.1  (Brundtland, 1987 ). To achieve the constraints of the, somewhat utopian, UNESCO definition does raise some discernible issues, such as, if materials are not to be depleted it will require infinite material resources, yet many natural sources of engineering materials are exhaustible, at least in terms of proven reserves, obvious examples include metals, rare earth minerals, and fossil fuels (Hayes, 2020 ; Jowitt, Mudd, & Thompson, 2020 ; Lim, 2020 ; Schulz, 2017 ). If engineering is to contribute to sustainable development, then there needs to be a growing awareness among existing engineers7  7 The term engineers is used as a shorthand for engineers, technologists and technicians who are all part of the engineering community.   and recent engineering graduates of exactly what sustainable engineering entails. Arguably, the starting point for acquiring this awareness should ideally be found in post-secondary education. Yet, there are very few undergraduate programs wholly focused on sustainable engineering although some, such as Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada, offers a “Renewable and Sustainable Energy Engineering”8  8 In Canada for a Higher Education Institute (HEI), usually a university, engineering program to receive accredited status the program title must include the word engineering.   degree while another Canadian University, the University of Prince Edward Island, has a program in Sustainable Design Engineering, both of which concentrate on particular aspects of sustainable engineering (Carleton University, 2022 ; University of Prince Edward Island, 2022 ). Post-secondary Civil and Environmental engineering programs increasingly include more studies in sustainability, indeed, the curriculum descriptions of many such programs tend to equate environmental engineering with sustainable engineering. Although engineers, other than coincidentally, do not make final managerial decisions they are invariably involved in these decisions especially with regard to the purchasing and procurement of equipment, the assessment of technical alternatives and solutions for a particular project, including, where appropriate, the choice of materials to be used. Traditionally, engineers have tended to propose the best technical solution, but if they are to contribute to the three pillars of sustainable development, future engineers need to be taught the necessity of balancing social and environmental costs with economic costs, while practicing engineers need to develop their skill-sets to include this balancing act. The first step is probably a firm foundation in engineering economics, which in the author's experience, is a topic rarely embraced by engineering academics because of the difficulty of acquiring peer-reviewed research grants, a deficiency which impacts career progression prospects. Consequently, the majority of engineering teachers do not particularly relish being assigned a course in engineering economics. Indeed, there are instances where the topic is taught to engineering undergraduates by management and business-school professors as an introductory course in macroeconomics as, in countries like Canada, economics is a mandatory topic in any accredited engineering degree. Nevertheless, in recent years, topics such as, life-cycle, cost-benefit and value-added analyses, and risk assessment, key concepts of engineering economics, have found their way into engineering curricula. Another promising trend is for the linkages between the topics of Engineering Economics and Sustainable Development, including the advent of an international journal in 2021 and specialist courses on the combined topic, being offered at the graduate level by such prestigious universities as Stanford in the United States (Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University, 2021 ; Stanford Online, 2022 ). Is, then, the overall impetus in sustainable engineering education to address the issues after initial graduation rather than during the foundation years? It seems that way since a Google® type search reveals that dedicated sustainable engineering degrees, certificates and diplomas are usually offered at the postbachelor levels whether by course-based studies or graduate research. Why? The answer is that sustainable engineering is increasingly acknowledged as an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary subject more related to what could be described as a systems engineering approach than the siloed and sometimes over-specialized traditional engineering disciplines such as mechanical, electrical, civil, and chemical engineering. However, these traditional disciplines are still needed both as foundational educational and training offerings together with an individual's initial pathway to the practice of engineering. Additional qualifications and continued professional development should ensure that an engineer fully appreciates the need and value of life-long learning. In this way, an understanding of sustainability can spread through the whole of the engineering profession and community enabling the role of engineering, in achieving not only the Agenda 2030 goals but also the requirements of the Paris Agreement and the Sendai framework, to be more readily identified. A framework for the hierarchy of sustainability and engineering's role is summarized in Fig. 1.8   (Fedkin, 2020 ). As shown in Fig. 1.8 , and discussed in Sections 1.2.3  and 1.2.3.1 , the principles of sustainability, and their three foundational pillars -- social, economic and environmental -- form the starting point for sustainable development. Perhaps a more meaningful way of describing these pillars was provided in the official announcement of the UN's General Assembly Resolution adopting “Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda” namely, “People, Planet and Prosperity ” to which were added peace  and partnership  giving the 5Ps of sustainability (Sun UN Network, 2015 ). The announcement emphasized the UN's determination to “end poverty and hunger ,” the people pillar; to “protect the planet from degradation ,” the planet pillar; and to “ensure that all human beings can enjoy prosperous and fulfilling lives ,” the prosperity pillar. These three pillars provide the principles which form the basis of the 17 sustainable development goals. The inclusion of the peace pillar was likely prompted by the growing evidence that armed conflicts were proving to be major obstacles for many in achieving sustainable human development, that is, “there can be no sustainable development without peace and no peace without sustainable development ” (Sun UN Network, 2015 ). These conflict obstacles remain, although, from the time of the Agenda 2030 announcements to the pre-COVID world of 2019, the number of deaths from conflicts and terrorism noticeably declined, (Fig. 1.9 )  (Roser, Hasell, Herre, & Macdonald, 2016-2019 ). Obviously, the 2022 invasion of Ukraine will have a measurable impact on these fatality numbers. Moreover, the global grain supply is also adversely affected by the same conflict causing severe challenges to the rate of progress toward the achieving the zero-hunger goal, SDG 2, and the people pillar of sustainable development, especially in Africa (Green, 2022 ) (Anuforo, 2022 ). Exactly how the pandemic and the eastern European conflict will impact the fifth pillar, “partnership” that is, a revitalized “Global Partnership for Sustainable Development ” is not clear. There are numerous examples of international engineering partnerships, and many national organizations are members of several of these partnerships, but the actual number of countries involved may be less than 10, for example, “The Dublin Accord” or no more than 30, for example, “The International Council of Academies of Engineering and Technological Sciences” (CAETS) and “Engineers Without Borders” (EWB) (CAETS, 2022 ; Engineers Without Borders International, 2022 ). Although there is an EWB international organization, in practice, the various national chapters operate independently and not all chapters are members of the overarching international organization (Wikipedia, 2022h ). In terms of what could be described as truly global engineering partnerships there are only two, the World Federation of Engineering Organizations (WFEO) and UNESCO, although the latter involves not only engineering partnerships (UNESCO, 2022 ; World Federation of Engineering Organizations, 2022a ). The WFEO, which now represents 100 national engineering institutions, was established by UNESCO in 1968 and now includes members such as Ingénieurs et Scientifiques de France, Engineers Australia, Engineers Canada, Science of Japan, and China Association for Science and Technology (World Federation of Engineering Organizations, 2022b ). UNESCO have published two reports dealing with Engineering internationally. The first, in 2010, “Engineering: Issues Challenges and Opportunities for Development ” was produced in conjunction with WFEO, CAETS and the International Federation of Consulting Engineers (FIDIC) (World Federation of Engineering Organizations, International Council of Academies of Engineering and Technological Sciences, International Federation of Consulting Engineers, UNESCO, 2010 ). The WFEO was also a partner in the second UNESCO report published in 2021, “Engineering for Sustainable Development: Delivering on the Sustainable Development ” along with the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE), Tsinghua University, and the UNESCO International Centre of Engineering Education (UICEE) (UNESCO-ICEE, 2021 ). From an engineering perspective both these reports are important documents although, anecdotally, they do not appear to be widely known or referenced in the general engineering community or, particularly, within academia. The second UNESCO report at 183 pages is somewhat shorter than the first but, ideally, should be required reading for all engineers and especially for engineering students in their study of sustainable development. It may be asked why the CAE and Tsinghua University, one of the world's top 20 universities, were so involved in the production of the second UNESCO report? A simple answer is that both of these Chinese institutions are leading world-class organizations, but the situation is complicated because of the withdrawal of the United States from UNESCO in 2018, not for the first time, and it has not rejoined (Mendis & Luszczykiewicz, 2021 ). As a major contributor to UNESCO's budget, and as many members are in arrears with their budget contributions, China has assumed the leadership role. The United States is not the only member who has left the UNESCO organization in the past, but most rejoin.9  9 The main point of controversy for the United States centers around UNESCO's decision to grant Palestine full-member status [HIR].   UNESCO was formally established about the same time as the United Nations itself and was viewed to be the most apolitical and democratic of all UN bodies with a remit to build global peace by enhancing and perpetuating international dialogue through education, science, and culture. Although under the auspices of the UN's Economic and Social Council, UNESCO is considered a “specialized agency” enjoying some autonomous characteristics. For example, every member, regardless of its size or power, has a vote and no member has the right of “veto power” unlike the permanent members of the UN Security Council. Moreover, while every member of the United Nations has the right to be a member of UNESCO, should it so choose, members of UNESCO can vote to admit members that are not members of the UN (Wikipedia, 2022d ). Regardless of the somewhat contentious issues facing UNESCO it is worth emphasizing that in 2022 UNESCO had 195 full members and nine associate members which is one of the largest groups in the UN system. The unresolved issues should not detract from the intrinsic value of the two international Engineering reports. Certainly, for the purposes of this chapter, the contents of second report have proved particularly useful. The two UNESCO engineering reports contain numerous citations and references which provide a wealth of information on the roles of engineering in sustainable development. Several technical articles and reports on these roles were published prior to the Agenda 2030 announcements, some within a few years of the start of this millennium (e.g., Dodds & Venabales, 2005 ; Gagnon, Leduc, & Savard, 2008 ). Moreover, since the advent of Agenda 2030 a number of organizations such as IRENA, the International Engineering Alliance, the International Energy Agency, WEFO, The Royal Academy of Engineering (RAEng) and others have published reports and digital media on particular SDGs for which engineering contributions are clearly involved, for example, the progress toward SDG 7 (IEA, IRENA, UNSD, World Bank, WHO, 2021 ). Consequently, there is no shortage of open access materials dealing with engineering and sustainable development. However, much of it deals with visions and missions and few specifics on exactly how engineering will help achieve the SDGs or the anticipated obstacles. This type of information is usually found in specialist publications such as the impact of critical mineral shortages (Gomez, 2022 ). But which SDGs can engineering contribute to and to which could the efforts of engineers be efficiently and effectively focused? 1.3.1 Possible avenues for sustainable engineering contributions Of the 17 SDGs there are some which, understandably, require engineering involvement, in the author's opinion, as summarized in Table 1.5  . However, if the full definitions of the goals are considered along with their defined targets and indicators then, arguably and to varying extents, engineering has a role to play in helping achieve all the goals. In the second UNESCO report, for each of the 17 goals there is a section10  10 Table 1.1 , Pages 28–36.   outlining: “How engineering can make it happen ” (UNESCO-ICEE, 2021 ). Thus, the list provided in Table 1.5  should be viewed as representing the core SDGs which cannot be achieved without robust engineering involvement whereas engineering can make contributions to the other 11 SDGs, not always by developing technologies but by cultural changes in the profession, such as required for Goal 5 (Gender Equality) and Goal 10 (Reduced Inequality). A further pointer to which SDGs the engineering community could best concentrate their technical efforts are those that reflect universally accepted human rights, such as access to sufficient food, safe drinking water and adequate shelter (housing); these are manifest in SDGs 6 and 11, to which should be added SDG 2, Zero Hunger. In the latter case, although the world produces sufficient food, access to that food is uneven across the global due to conflict and supply-chain issues. Engineering could help solve the supply issues especially at the local levels by developing technologies which enable the monitoring of possible reductions in food security caused by temporary climate events and the communication of such situations to the appropriate relief agencies. In effect a famine early-warning system (UNESCO-ICEE, 2021 ). While not a UN adopted human right, SDG 7, the goal to ensure access for all people to affordable and clean energy, especially cooking fuels, is crucial to human development. The solutions are not as straightforward as may be imagined as the requirements of SDG 13, climate change, could provide almost overwhelming challenges, especially indicator 13.2.1,11  11 (Partly) To lower greenhouse gas emissions but not threaten food production.   to the achievement of SDG 7 in low-income countries and regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, where affordable and clean are not necessarily mutually inclusive virtues. In terms of sustainability, there also appears to be some disconnect among the general public's and the media's perception of what are sustainable energy sources and what are sustainable energy convertors. These somewhat flawed perceptions are also compounded by a similar misinterpretation of what constitutes a renewable energy source but, in this case, the inconsistencies are primarily driven by the varying judgments of political leaders and swathes of the scientific community. Politicians are lawmakers, scientists and engineers can only provide opinions and advice. There is also a lack of appreciation that the earth's natural resources are finite, not just fossil fuels, but it includes materials which are increasingly used in renewable and green energy devices. Nevertheless, of all the sustainable development targets SDG 7 is one of the prime candidates for engineering involvement given its long history of energy generation, utilization, and distribution (Smil, 2010 ) (Rhodes, 2019 ). These matters are discussed further in Sections 1.3.2 –1.3.4 . The cultural aspects of achieving particular goals are also assuming growing importance not only with gender and inequality issues but also, for example, as a criterion for achieving adequate shelter, whether for new or retrofitted buildings, regardless of affordability. Additionally, as with affordable and clean energy challenges, there are potential tensions between achieving sustainable buildings and meeting the requirements of the Paris Agreement, the Sendai Framework, and the SDG 13 goal (i.e., climate action). For the environmental sustainability pillar, as typified by the Paris Agreement, the use of the most popular and affordable construction material, concrete, involves manufacturing processes which are one of the major generators of greenhouse gases (GHG), especially carbon dioxide (CO2 ), a contributing factor to anthropogenic climate change and surface temperature rises (Nature Editorial, 2021 ). Similarly, although not a specific criteria for determining building affordability, and which will likely negatively affect it, is SDG 13 target indicators, 13.1.2, which requires increasing the speed of adoption and implementation of the Sendai Framework (United Nations, 2015a ). To do so, all 7 targets12  12 Paraphrased.   of the framework must be met and the fourth target is to: “Substantially reduce disaster damage to critical infrastructure and disruption of basic services,  and develop their resilience by 2030 ,” the reason for the latter is “to ensure that they remain safe, effective and operational during and after disasters ” (United Nations, 2015b ). These requirements, if fully implemented, will invariably result in higher construction costs which will likely lead to less affordable housing and, if concrete continues to be the building material of choice, there will be increased GHG emissions, at least initially. Given such scenarios, it is inevitable that Engineers and Architects face considerable challenges in creating sustainable cities and communities as envisaged in Agenda 2030. Engineering has contributed significantly for centuries to (a) clean water and sanitation, (b) industry, innovation, and infrastructure, and (c) agricultural machinery developments for improving food production. For example, in terms of the past, present and possibly future contributions of engineering to clean water production, from Greek and Roman filtration systems, to the use of plants and soils in green roof rainwater purification, to modern membrane-based technologies, insights are provided in numerous publications (Purdue University, 2022 ; Reader, 2021a ). However, to fully achieve the UN SDG targets, that is, 6, 9, and 2, will require significant political actions on both national and global scales, although engineering can improve the likelihood of eventual success by further refining the technological systems already developed to provide these societal necessities. The same is true for many of the SDG targets and indicators leading to what has been described as the sixth wave of engineering innovation, as illustrated in Fig. 1.10   (World Federation of Engineering Organizations, International Council of Academies of Engineering and Technological Sciences, International Federation of Consulting Engineers, UNESCO, 2010 ).  1.3.2 Sustainability of energy sources and convertors If either the UNSECO definition of sustainable engineering, as given in Section 1.3 , or the Brundtland definition of sustainability, Section 1.1 , is used then there are no sustainable energy sources. Why then is there global momentum to use only sustainable and renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind and water? At least 50% of the sun's energy has already been expended and it is not renewable. How then can solar energy be available for future generations? Given that a generation is usually considered to be 33 years, or three generations per century, and a sufficient amount of solar energy will reach the Earth for at least the next 30 million generations, then it is considered that it will be at least a billion years before the Earth's surface temperature becomes unbearable and uninhabitable for humans as the sun continues to move closer to the Earth, eventually engulfing it in about 4–5 billion years (Scudder, 2015 ; Starr, 2021 ). If an energy source can be guaranteed for 30 million future generations that should be sufficient to consider the source sustainable. As wind power is reliant on solar energy, as it is geographical temperature differences that cause winds, it is equally realistic to consider wind energy as a sustainable source. But what about water energy sources? Water energy sources are the result of water movement and the technologies used to generate power, usually in the form of electricity, use either elevation differences (head) between the water inputs and outputs or the kinetic energy of the water motion. Although all water-power generation can be classified as hydropower it is usual to label power produced from the potential energy associated with static facilities such as dams, reservoirs, and rivers as hydropower while that produced by capture of the kinetic energy of tides is referred to tidal or hydrokinetic power. This description is somewhat of a simplification since rivers and lake can experience tides, but a tidal range of about 7 m is necessary to achieve a viable tidal power system. Another form of “marine” water energy is wave utilization whose devices can be used to capture both kinetic and potential energy. Additionally, marine-type current turbines can also be used to generate power in fast-flowing rivers. Nonetheless, the categorization of water-power into two basic forms enable the concept of water energy sustainability to be more readily addressed. In the case of hydropower, the necessary elevation differences are created either artificially, such as by dams and reservoirs, or naturally, by changes in river heights. Because of climatic and environmental factors, it is problematic to consider all hydropower energy sources as sustainable and renewable. The sustainability problem is not inherent in marine water systems as the tides are driven by the natural gravitational interactions between the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun. The role of the sun in tide generations is often not mentioned but, in fact, its influence is measurable being about half as strong as the moon's (Institute of Physics, 2022 ). As previously mentioned, the sun is going to be present for an extremely long time but what about the Moon? The moon is spinning away annually from the Earth at a variable rate of 3.8 cm, resulting in a weakening of its force on the Earth and hence tidal ranges (Dorminey, 2017 ). However, this present situation is considered to be anomalous, and it is more likely that the Moon and the Earth are on a collision course, that is, what astronomers call an inspiral, but if that happens it would be 65 billion years in the future! That being the case the likelihood of a catastrophic inspiral is zero, since the Earth and the Moon will have been consumed by the sun long before such an event (Allain, 2021 ; Dorminey, 2017 ). Thus, like solar and wind power, water-power, especially if generated by tides, can be considered sustainable. Also, like solar and wind power, generation tidal power is an intermittent energy source being available for only about 10 hours per day (Boucher, 2015 ). On the other hand, sustainable hydropower can be available all day although its output can be variable. So solar, wind and water energy sources are sustainable by any practical measure, but the core of the sustainability issue is the definition of “future generations” for which there are no definitions or interpretive guidelines. Modern humans, homo sapiens, have only existed for about 300,000 years, less than 10,000 generations, so is it really necessary, or realistic, for the present population to have to take far-reaching measures to ensure that a future generation almost a billion years from now, 2022, will be able to meet their own needs? In terms of energy sustainability, the modeling results of some researchers suggest that in the period 2030–2050 a complete transition to solar, wind, and water sources can be achieved, in which case the future generation concerns would disappear (Jacobsen, 2020 ). However, an analysis of the history of energy transitions casts doubt on such optimism as transitions have invariably taken much longer than envisaged, with cost, availability and security of supply being the key drivers of the timeframes (Smil, 2010 , 2016 ). Although, in general, the favored energy transition sources are solar, wind and water, other renewable and sustainable energy sources, such as geothermal and biomass, cannot be ignored in the evolution to affordable energy for all. Geothermal is a natural energy source found below the Earth's surface. It is rooted in hot dry igneous rocks or in molten or semimolten forms called magma. The deeper the distance from the Earth's surface the higher the temperature, the average global temperature varies with depth, and the geothermal gradient is about 25°C per km to 30°C per km. However, this gradient is almost twice as steep in the volcanic and earthquake areas found along tectonic plate boundaries (Donev, Hanania, Meyer, Sheardown, & Stenhouse, 2019b ; Earle, 2019 ). This is especially the case for the Pacific's “Ring-of-Fire” (Mancini, 2021 ), but the occurrence of two major tectonic plates close to Iceland allows the country to produce 25% of its electricity from geothermal sources along with heating for 90% of its buildings. In 2018, the cost to the consumer for Icelandic electricity was 30% cheaper than in countries like the United Kingdom (BBC, 2018 ). Nevertheless, in terms of the globally installed geothermal energy capacity, almost 25% is in the USA, a ring-of-fire country with nearly five times the capacity of Iceland (Ritcher, 2022 ). The thermal energy of these sources can be transferred to naturally occurring water below the surface, usually called groundwater, but fissures or conduits in the rock strata can carry the hot water or steam to the surface. The hot rocks and magma in the upper 10 km of the continental USA store about 6000 times more energy than the total global oil reserves (Decker & Decker, 2022 ). Worldwide this 10 km layer contains an estimated 50,000 times more energy than all the global oil and gas resources (IRENA, 2017 ). If these energy sources can be accessed, usually by some form of drilling, and if the fluid temperatures on reaching the surface are sufficiently high they can drive steam-electrical generators. In geothermal terms, the deeper the better in terms of the source temperature, and new technologies are being constantly developed to better utilize geothermal energy, such as Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) (American Geosciences Institute (AGI), 2022 ). Drilling to great depths can be expensive, especially if several boreholes are required to find a suitable geothermal fluid source. To overcome such issues, EGS systems are being developed whereby if hot but dry rocks are located, high pressure water is injected to create fissures or to open blocked fissures and “engineer” a reservoir with a second borehole drilled to extract the geothermal energy (AGI, 2022 ). This process is akin to “fracking” and can lead to “induced seismicity” which, while being a more acceptable description than “earthquake” could have the same devastating environment effects (Majer, Nelson, Robertson-Tait, Savy, & Ivan, 2012 ). Despite the possible adverse implications of using geothermal energy, it is classified by energy agencies as renewable and sustainable. This categorization is arguably contentious since, apart from the environmental concerns, geothermal reservoirs tend to be depleted with use although steps can be taken to help replenish the thermal resources. However, the point is that although a particular source is not necessarily renewable or sustainable, in terms of use by future generations, globally geothermal energy resources could support energy extraction for at least 2.5 million years13  13 Based on author's calculations of 2017 known resources and UN forecasts of energy use to 2100.   and likely for much longer. For some regions, whether for utility scale or individual household utilization, geothermal energy could be an attractive pathway to affordable, reliable and “sustainable” power. There are other sources of energy, some of which are not considered renewable and sustainable, and engineers need to aware of these as access to affordable energy will be the benchmark, not only for SDG 7, but also for any hope of encouraging universally acceptable energy transitions. As availability is also one of Smil's three transition drivers it is likely that while energy transitions could be global the precise nature of the transitions will reflect regional resources (Smil, 2010 ). Arguably, geothermal energy is an example of regional or localized transition attractiveness. In addition to those energy sources already mentioned, there are several other sources that engineers need to think about when offering advice on appropriate energy choices for specific situations. As such, they have a menu of sources to help them in this task, as summarized in Table 1.6  . It should be noted that those sources in the table which are in italics  are candidates to replace fossil fuels for reasons already discussed, that is, the associations between the use of such fuels and the global warming aspects of anthropogenic climate change. Awareness of possible future energy sources, which are not as yet technically mature, should also be part of engineering's energy tool-box. Nuclear fusion promises to provide very inexpensive electrical energy but not within the timelines of Agenda 2030 and, despite the operating cost advantage and the arguments that fusion would be a sustainable energy source, there will need to be a pivotal change in attitude from the general public's aversion to the use of nuclear power (Stine & Labonte, 2022 ; Warburg, 2022 ). In terms of timelines, hydrogen energy may be universally adopted sooner than nuclear fusion although not by 2030. There are many different types of hydrogen energy, but not all are renewable and sustainable, which can lead to some general misunderstandings. Although hydrogen, the most abundant element, does occur sporadically on earth in pure form, “white” hydrogen, in practical terms it is produced from materials such as fossil fuels, biomass, ammonia and, possibly, metal hydrides. Only “Green” hydrogen, produced by electrolysis using renewable energy sources, meets the sustainability source definition (Marchant, 2021, July 27 ). However, while nuclear fusion and green hydrogen are energy sources for the future, that is, post-2030, what other current sources are relevant in the achievement of SDG 7? The answer is biofuels. Consequently, and to complete this discussion of sustainable energy sources, a brief review of the use and abuse of bioenergy is provided. The categorization of bioenergy sources, including biomass, as renewable and sustainable remains a matter of some debate with differing opinions among groups of policymakers (US Department of Energy, Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) 2016, September 15 ) and scientists (Cho, 2016  (updated); Elbein, 2019 ). Nevertheless, biomass and its derivates, traditional and modern, are deemed to be carbon neutral since they only release captured carbon dioxide which will eventually be recaptured and sequestrated through new plant growth. The sequestration does not happen immediately but takes a finite amount of time, called carbon payback  (Manomet Center for Conservation Sciences, 2010 ). This can take between 1 year and 1000 years (Mitchell, Harmon, & O'Connell, 2012 ) and, while the lower end of that period appears to be the more likely (Chen, Ter-Mikaelian, Yang, & J, 2018 ), the burning of wood from Norwegian boreal forests can result in a payback period of 150–230 years (Holtsmark, 2010 ). The counter-argument is that biofuels could be used to displace conventional fossil fuels and provide a net positive impact on carbon dioxide emission levels during the payback time periods. The situation is somewhat confusing which has led to some discomfort about the unconstrained acceptance of the carbon-neutrality of biofuels (Woodford, 2022 ). However, not all political policymakers have expressed such qualms about compliance (Catanoso, 2019 ; Heikkinen, 2018 ). The inference could be that increasing CO2  in the Agenda 2030 period is not as crucial as portrayed. Yet, while there could be changes to the criteria used to qualify biofuels as renewable, there is little doubt that most forms of bioenergy will retain their status in the foreseeable future. Moreover, regardless of the status of bioenergy sources, they do enjoy a significant share of the global primary energy mix, in the region of 10% (IEA, 2022d ). Indeed, in a heavily forested country such as Finland this share, as of 2018, is over 31%, greater than all other energy sources (IEA, 2018 ). Conversely, in terms of absolute biomass energy generation, the United States is one of the top three countries but in 2017 biomass fuels provided only about 5% of its total primary energy use (USEIA, 2022  updated). Other “developed” countries such as the UK have converted large, previously coal fired, power plants to wood pellet burning, biomass being the largest source of renewable energy consumption in the country. However, it is noteworthy that 82% of the wood pellets used in the UK are imported from North America and, because of a legal loophole, neither the exporters nor the importers have to count the emissions in their inventories (Beeler & Morrison, 2018 ; Census 2021, 2019 ). In the European Union [EU] the use of biomass constitutes almost 60% of all renewable energy use and 96% of their biomass is produced within the EU (Scarlat, Taylor, Dallemand, & Banja, 2019 ). Thus, biomass is a globally important renewable energy source. But what exactly is biomass? A definition was proposed in 1975 but has evolved in the scientific literature to mean any organic matter, wood, crops, seaweed and algae, animal wastes, human sewage, and municipal solid wastes (MSW) that can be used as an energy source (USEIA, 2022  updated; Whittaker, Likens, & Lieth, 1975 ). These sources are collectively referred to as biomass feedstocks and examples of their use are given in Table 1.7   (USEIA, 2022  updated). However, it could be that the adverse effects may be exaggerated as, in terms of modern renewable energy generation, biomass's share is less than that of solar, wind and water and, in terms of global primary energy, the renewables share is still less than any of the fossil fuel sources, as illustrated in Fig. 1.11   (BP, 2022 ). Even so, it would be irresponsible to ignore the fact that the use of “unclean” cooking fuels, mainly biomass based, by 2.4 billion people causes household air pollution [HAP] resulting in almost 4 million premature deaths according to the WHO (WHO, 2020 ). Clean, or at least cleaner, fuels rather than the efforts to improved cooking facilities have been found to offer better solutions to the HAP global health issues (Pope, Bruce, Dherani, Jagoe, & Rehfuess, 2017 ). But how can people be persuaded to forego the use of cheap and available cooking energy and use more expensive and presently unavailable sources? Nevertheless, there are examples of modern rapid energy source transitions on a national level including the replacement of coal and significant increases in the use of the sustainable sources already described (Smil, 2016 ). If individual nations can achieve rapid energy transitions, then it is possible that they could also fulfill the future generations attributes of sustainability well before the end of the 21st century, but not by 2030. However, could this be repeated on a global scale? Other nations, especially poorer ones with low-income populations, likely have more pressing problems to solve than worrying about the needs of generations a billion years from now. They may have to accept a less ambitious definition of what sustainability means in terms of future generations. Whatever definition of future generation, national and global, eventually emerges, it will influence exactly what is meant by the term sustainability. Energy from sources needs to be collected, converted, and distributed. Since the arrival of electricity, the main types of energy conversion are from source to mechanical and electrical forms with secondary conversions from mechanical to electrical and vice versa, as summarized in Fig. 1.12   (Reader, 2021b ). Modern conversion devices include rotary and reciprocating mechanical mechanisms, for example, combustion engines, wind, water and marine turbines, and direct convertors such as photovoltaic panels and fuel cells. None of these convertors meet the criteria necessary to be classified as sustainable. Indeed, using the 33-year definition of a human generation, there are few instances where the devices will remain operational and effective for a full generation. There are many reasons for this including, material degradation, natural wear and tear, the lack of or the cost of regular maintenance and the availability of more efficient options in terms of both performance and costs. This is also true for the assembled systems, for example, transportation, industrial and agricultural machinery, power generation and distribution equipment which use the various energy conversion devices. A typical example of the lack of sustainability, as defined, is the average personal on-road vehicle lifetime. The literature reveals than the average lifetime is 8–12 years based on 200,000–300,000 km of use (Ortiz, 2022 ). Some electric vehicles have already achieved over 640,000 km according to a Tesla® taxi company (Budd, 2018 ). However, many of the components used in these vehicles have far shorter lifetimes such as tires, about 80,000 km, batteries, brake parts, and so on. Nevertheless, with regular maintenance and replacement components, the lifetime of automobiles can be significantly extended. An often-quoted example, taken from the 2014 Guinness World Records™ is that of a 1966 Volvo® P1800S which, between the time of purchase and 2014, the single owner had driven for over 5 million km, received 33 sets of tires, 130 sets of brake pads, 492 spark plugs, and 938 oil changes (Budd, 2018 ). While automobile technology has greatly advanced since 1966, especially with regard to improved electronic sensors, powertrain management controllers and the associated software, to achieve the same type of longevity as the Volvo® example will still need the commitment of very dedicated owners. The lifetime of the above example is still only 50 years, a generation and a half, so it can hardly be claimed as “sustainable” for future generations. Does this mean that automobiles can never be considered sustainable? Not exactly, particularly if recycling is considered to be an element of sustainability. This can be appreciated by highlighting some of the key basic facts concerning the recycling of automotive materials especially from end-of-life (EVL) vehicles and from the components removed prior to EVL as a result of regular maintenance, servicing or necessary repair, (Table 1.8 )  (Colthorpe, 2019 ; Leblanc, 2019 ; Wikipedia, 2022e ). The recycling facts given in Table 1.8  would apply equally to Electric Vehicles (e.g., HEVs and BEVs)14  14 HEV, hybrid electric vehicle; BEV, battery electrical vehicle.   apart from III, as Lead-Acid batteries will likely not be the electrochemical battery of choice. However, the actual scale of the facts, especially IX, would change and, in a green future, it is highly debatable whether discarded tires would be used as a fuel source. Notwithstanding these recycling variances between Internal Combustion engine cars and electric vehicles, transitioning to all electric transportation will not make such vehicles sustainable. The more traditional methods of energy conversion for the production of electricity, that is, thermal power stations which use various heat energy sources, fossil fuels, nuclear and occasionally biomass, generally in the form of wood pellets, all have standard features such as boilers to provide steam to the turbines which in turn drive the electrical generators. Provided the installations are regularly and routinely maintained, components repaired or replaced when necessary, the lifetimes of such power plants can be 40 years or more, closer to 50 years for some nuclear driven generation facilities (Cui et al., 2019 ; SAPL. (n.d.) July 7, 2022 ). As with automobiles, many of the components and structural materials of these types of power plants can be recycled except for the radioactive waste from the nuclear fissure process and any associated fixtures and fittings. So, not only are the energy sources used by the traditional power generating system unsustainable but so are the assemblies of the energy conversion systems. While transitions to sustainable energy sources may solve the issues associated with anthropogenic climate change and the finite amount of internal energy, that is, Earth's natural sources, is it possible that sustainability of energy conversion can be also achieved? The answer is no, and it appears that the lifetimes of the convertors of sustainable energy are shorter than their nonsustainable counterparts. Thus, the lack of sustainability is also manifest with the devices used to convert solar, wind and water energy into useable energy forms, for example, electricity. While solar photovoltaic (PV) panels have become increasingly popular, both for individual residences and utility scale uses, and their modularity means more panels can be added to a particular facility or, indeed, the number can be reduced, their lifetimes are at best only 50% of those achieved with traditional infrastructure (Richardson, 2021 ). Although there are other means of producing power from solar energy, mainly using “mirrored” systems, the lifetimes do not seem to demonstrate appreciable improvements, if any, over the PV systems. A good quality wind turbine may last between 20 and 25 years, depending on its location, that is, onshore versus off-shore, and physical size, that is, its height (hub height) and blade lengths (rotor diameter). Over the last two decades, particularly in the United States, the wind turbine heights are getting higher and the diameters larger, (Fig. 1.13 )  (US Department of Energy, 2021 ). The higher the turbine placement the wind is less disrupted compared with surface levels, that is, wind speeds are greater and, together with larger rotor diameters, more power is generated. However, the higher and wider a wind turbine gets, the greater the structural loads on the installation and this could negatively impact the turbine's lifetime (Phillips, 2022 ; TWI-Global, 2022 ). There is still insufficient data to draw any firm conclusions on the effects of larger wind turbines on sustainability but intuitively the challenges of maintenance and repair will be magnified. In relative terms there is very limited data on the lifetimes of marine turbines but perhaps some idea can be gained from the recent announcement that the world's most powerful tidal turbine to be installed off the Scottish coast has a planned lifetime of 15 years (Frangoul, 2021 ). This is short compared with hydropower installations where many are over 50 years old and some over 100 years old (Renewables First. (n.d.) July 7, 2022 ). The United States National Renewable Energy Laboratory investigated the useful lifetimes of the conversion systems used with renewable sources, such as solar and wind, and included the two contentiously defined renewables, that is, biomass and geothermal (NREL, 2016 ). The results are given in Table 1.9   along with a brief summary of the lifetimes of energy convertors from nonsustainable sources. Items marked § are contentious, being accepted by some scientists and politicians but not others. Regardless of the type of energy source, the examples given in Table 1.7  clearly indicate that energy convertors do not meet the future generations criteria required to be defined as sustainable. These differences need to be emphasized in any discussions concerning energy and access to energy.  1.3.3 Engineering and SDG 7 progress The current growth of global populations and the history of civilizations have a common factor, energy (Smil, 2017 ). From the invention of pulleys to the advent of nuclear power stations and the harnessing of external energy sources such as solar and gravity, humans have found a way to eliminate, or at least reduce, the exertions required when muscle energy was, or is, the only power source. A core problem with the connections between energy supply and people is that the access to the associated power sources is not available to all. There are also instances where access may be possible physically, but the cost of that access is too expensive for many. As engineering has always been involved, invariably, in energy developments to provide what are, in essence, convenient labor-saving devices, for example, cars for transport, agricultural machinery for more efficient food production, lighting and heating for home and workplace, literally at the “flick-of-a-switch” then of all the transformative SDGs, energy is fundamental to human development and one, Table 1.5 , which has evident connections to engineering. Subsequently, to provide a specific illustration of how engineering can make Agenda 2030 happen, this section focuses on SDG 7, access to energy. The goal of SDG 7 is to: “Ensure to access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all ” and this goal (see Table 1.1 ) has 5 targets and 6 indicators as listed in Table 1.10   (United Nations, 2022e ). Targets 7.1–7.3 are considered national targets whereas 7A and 7B are international targets. However, in tracking indicators to pictorially demonstrate progress it can be useful to display regional as well as national trends and, where possible, to provide a global overview as can be appreciated by the exemplars shown in Fig. 1.14   for access to electricity, indicator 7.1.1 (Ritchie, Roser, & Rosado, 2020 ). While, in general, the nature of the targets and their indicators are self-explanatory in discussing the SDG 7 goal, arguably the term “modern energy” requires further elaboration. The meaning of the term is infrequently mentioned in the literature dealing with energy topics but for many years the IEA have provided a definition of modern energy in annual World Energy Outlook reports. Although the precise wording has changed over the last decade the substance of the definition has not, so what is modern energy? One generally accepted definition provided by the IEA is: “Modern energy access: Includes household access to a minimum level of electricity; household access to less harmful and more sustainable cooking and heating fuels, and stoves; access that enables productive economic activity; and access for public services ” (IEA, 2021a ). However, care has to be taken when interpreting such definitions and the type of data provided in Fig. 1.14 . In the latter case “access to electricity” means individual households having an electrical source which can provide very basic lighting and charge a phone or power a radio for 4 hours a day (Ritchie, Roser, & Rosado, 2020 ). Such electricity access thresholds have been used over the past three decades since 1993 by the IEA in their World Energy Model to provide their periodic, now annual, global outlook projections (IEA, 2021b ). The seemingly extremely modest threshold embedded in the OWD depictions in Fig. 1.14  was used by the IEA in their 2019 energy outlook report for Africa where, in terms of power requirement, it was assumed that for rural households this minimum threshold was 250 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year and for an urban household was 500 kWh per year (Cozzi, Bouckaert, Kim, & McNamara, 2019 ). According to the World Bank in 2014, the average electrical power consumption per capita in sub-Saharan Africa was 487 kWh and hence in harmony with the then WEM assumptions. However, by 2022 several countries in the sub-Saharan regions were consuming less than 200 kWh per capita annually (Alves, 2022 ; World Population Review, 2022 ). The IEA update their WEM modeling process annually and have continuingly envisaged that there would be an increasing level of electricity consumption over time especially for access-poor locations so they would reach their national or regional average. The reasons for the geographical codicils are probably because the average annual electricity consumption globally is over 3 MW per capita representing a “bridge too far” for less wealthy countries. This situation is even more exaggerated when compared with rich, mainly western, countries such as the United States, Canada and particularly Iceland as annual electricity use per capita is 12.2 MW, 16.6 MW and 56.8 MW respectively, as of 2022 (Alves, 2022 ). Clearly, a definition of access to electricity based on a universal benchmark for energy use per capita is an illusory concept. A more workable definition of access to energy and electricity is used by IEA, that is, “a household having reliable and affordable access to both clean cooking facilities and to electricity, which is enough to supply a basic bundle of energy services initially, and with the level of service capable of growing over time ,” (IEA, 2021b ). But what constitutes a basic bundle? Initially, the IEA's basic bundle would be an improvement on the 4 hours per day access used to produce Fig. 1.14 , but the growth benchmark for the “power” needs for the average household, who has gained access, would be sufficient power to operate all of the following, (a) four lightbulbs for 5 hours per day, (b) one refrigerator, (c) a fan for 6 hours per day, (d) a mobile phone charger, and (e) a television for 4 hours per day. This new benchmark would require 1.25 MW per household annually which could be reduced to 425 kWh if energy efficient devices were used (IEA 2020, October 13 , 2021b ). The basic bundle approach has not yet been adopted for defining access to electricity. Nevertheless, using the more traditional approach to assessing access to electricity there have been noticeable improvements in the past decade. This is known because of the now annual energy progress reports dealing with the tracking of SDG 7 indicators as given in Table 1.10 , the latest published in 2022 (IEA, IRENA, UNSD, World Bank, WHO, 2022 ). The 2022 report highlights that progress has been made in the achievements of all indicators except 7.a.1, the international financial flows to developing countries. Indicator 7.b.1 is not dealt with in the recent reports as it is a repeat of the SDG indicator 12.a.1 which is dealt with separately in different tracking publications. These improvements are summarized in Table 1.11   (IEA, IRENA, UNSD, World Bank, WHO, 2022 ). As with much of the literature and media dealing with renewable energy the data provided by the tracking of indicator 7.2.1, the share of renewable energy sources in the total final energy consumption (TFEC), paints somewhat of a rosier picture than is the actual reality, as acknowledged in many UN publications (United Nations, 2022e ). For example, if traditional biomass is excluded as a renewable the share of TFEC is reduced to 11.5%. This is indicative of the limitation of the data collection methodology used for renewable energy usage as it is not yet possible to distinguish whether the renewable energy is being produced in a sustainable manner. It is the case that in UN developing countries, households may use wood and charcoal associated with unsustainable forestry management practices, also, in general, global bioenergy sources can be permanently depleted unless they are, or can be, replaced. It is these factors which raise doubts about the renewability and sustainability of biomass sources. The TFEC benchmark is used as it emphasizes the amount of renewable energy actually consumed rather than the capacity for renewable energy production, which, because of the present intermittency of solar, wind and water, cannot always be fully utilized due to periods of so-called over-generation. A much fuller explanation of how indicator 7.1.1 and 7.2.1 data are collected and analyzed, and the present limitations of the developed methodologies, is given in the SDG 7 metadata repository including web-links to supporting publications (United Nations, 2022b ). Briefly, a review of the repository reveals that the data collected for determining access to electricity are from the demand side as experienced by the population rather than from the supply side information normally provided by Governments. This is achieved by using household surveys and censuses obtained from national statistics agencies as well as international agencies such as the UN and World Bank. The rationale being that a better understanding is gained of access levels experienced by the actual end-users. This is considered a necessary approach because the presence of an electricity connection in the household does not necessarily guarantee that the energy supplied is adequate in terms of quality, reliability, and affordability, issues highlighted when the SDG 7 goal was first developed (Wu & Wu, 2015 ). These authors also pointed out that many people living in countries and regions without a ready stock of fossil fuels have historically had to rely on unclean fuels such as the combustion of wood and animal dung to provide heat for cooking. As 2.4 billion people still do not have access to clean fuels for cooking, access to electricity becomes more even important (see Table 1.10 ). Why? Natural gas and petroleum gas, likely in liquid form, once considered as attractive replacements for the solid unclean cooking fuels, are now labeled as “dirty.” Lead by the United States and the European Union, a formal pledge, “the Global Methane Pledge (GMP)” which by June 2022 was accepted by over 100 countries, seeks to significantly reduce methane gas emissions as a mitigation strategy to meet the Paris Agreement target of reducing surface temperatures (The White House, 2021 ; US Department of State, 2022 ). This could result in countries still heavily reliant on unclean cooking fuels to have no option but to use electricity for cooking. A possible alternative could see household solar cookers once again enjoying some of the popularity they achieved in rural areas toward the later part of the 20th century although they were never mass-produced and had to be used in direct sunlight. The methodologies used to determine the numerical values of the 7.1.1–7.2.1 need to be understood by engineers, especially since the use of surveys and censuses are not customarily encountered in engineering measurements. The energy supply side data will likely be more pertinent to them. It is worth noting why generated energy is not being used so that such situations can be factored into the engineering efforts to help achieve the SDG 7.1 and 7.2 targets. The same circumstances apply when using indicator 7.3.1, energy intensity. All engineers, and likely many others, will intuitively recognize and understand the term energy efficiency. The general aim is to reduce energy intensity but increase energy efficiency. To appreciate both the differences and compatibility between the two measures, the definitions provided by the United States Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy offer some insight (USDOE, n.d. ): “Energy Intensity  is measured by the quantity of energy required per unit output or activity, so that using less energy to produce a product reduces the intensity .” “Energy Efficiency  improves when a given level of service is provided with reduced amounts of energy inputs or services are enhanced for a given amount of energy input .” While efficiency is usually expressed as a percentage or ratio, normally by comparing energy output with energy input, energy intensity is expressed in megajoules per unit of GDP in constant 2017 US$15  15 Based on purchasing power parity.   (IEA and UNSD, 2022, March 31 ). Energy intensity can be used an inverse proxy for energy efficiency when a specific technology is being considered but in general it is an imperfect measure of energy efficiency (IEA and UNSD, 2022, March 31 ). So, the reduction in the value of energy intensity in Table 1.11  (SDG 7.3.1) could indicate, but not always, an increase in energy efficiency. In the determination of energy intensity, the total energy supply for a particular national economy is determined by calculating the national energy production to which the net energy imports are added, while the international marine and aviation fuel bunkers plus-stock changes are subtracted, a globally agreed methodology. The energy data are collected by both the IEA and the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) while the data for the associated measure of economic output, that is, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), is collected and collated by the World Bank Group (United Nations, 2022b ). However, since 2009, the IEA has also collected data on energy efficiency indicators concentrating on the major energy-use sectors; residential, services, industry, and transport (IEA, 2022a ). These indicators are likely to be of more helpfulness to engineers than the energy intensity measurements. In both cases, the information gathered by the IEA, UNSD and Eurostat, the European Commission's version of UNSD, use questionnaires sent to and received from the statistical departments of national agencies. An example is provided in this reference (IEA, 2022b ). According to the US Department of Energy, both energy intensity and energy efficiency measurements, and the distinction between them, is important when multiple technologies and products are being compared, but both are problematic if applied to a complete, that is, an aggregated economy, and aggregated range of manufactured goods, suggesting that in these cases energy intensity numbers “disguises rather than illuminates ” and energy efficiency “is not a meaningful concept ” (USDOE. (n.d.) July 10, 2022 ). The possible connections between SDG 7 achievements and engineering are therefore not as straightforward or as intuitive as may be believed. The measurement of the targets contains social aspects which, if not alien to those used by engineers, will need to be better understood in engineering assessments and subsequent actions. Conversely, it needs to be generally understood that few engineering devices meet the sustainability requirement of future generations. In which case the term sustainable engineering could be a misleading title unless a more realistic definition of sustainability is forthcoming.  1.3.4 Sustainability of engineering materials A major impetus for the momentum toward sustainable development and energy transitions were the concerns about the rapidly diminishing reserves of fossil fuels, the “end-of-oil.” Such concerns had been expressed over a century ago and were repeated at regular intervals throughout the 20th century. These utterances prompted the pursuit of renewable and sustainable sources of energy to replace fossil fuels. This pursuit accelerated in the 1990s as fears of global warming and anthropogenic climate change became evident. These climatic events became associated with the increasing levels of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) in the atmospheric greenhouse layer largely due to human activity, that is, the combustion of fossil and carbonaceous fuels. To mitigate the warming problem an obvious solution was to eliminate, or severely reduce, CO2  emissions. As the largest source of anthropogenic CO2  comes from the use of fossil fuels it made sense to stop using them. It was also considered that whatever energy sources replaced fossil fuels, the same situation of diminishing reserves should be avoided and, thus, the concept of renewable energy sources was established. If these renewable sources were to be available for future generations then they also had to be sustainable. The fears of climate change and the role attributed to GHGs, such as CO2  and Methane, remain, but the “end of fossil fuels” has not transpired. Between 1999 and 2019 proven, or proved, reserves of oil grew by 36%, Natural Gas by over 50% and coal by 1% (BP, 2020 ). How can this be? The reason is that such reserves are a measure of how much can be extracted in an economically profitable manner, not a measure of the actual known resources. Depending on the market cost, and the cost of extracting the resources, the amount of proved reserves can increase or decrease. The estimates of how long coal will remain available were often reported in the literature at just over 110 years but, for the United States, this was recently updated to over 479 years from 2021 (USEIA, 2021 ). Although there is a significant degree of uncertainty in estimating resources if they were to become proved reserves then, at the present rates of consumption, it would appear that coal could last for over 2 millennia, natural gas for 1 millennia and oil well into the 21st century (Covert, Greenstone, & Knittel, 2016 ). While not meeting the “no depletion for future generations criteria” the urgency to transition away from fossil fuels is clearly driven by climate change concerns and modeling forecasts. Moreover, fossil fuel resources can be considered renewable but, as it takes millions of years to form new stocks, it is more than reasonable to label the present known resources as finite and, further, to appreciate that not all these resources will be recoverable and become proved reserves. The reserves versus resources issue applies to all natural commodities so the materials used in the manufacture of the devices used to convert renewable and sustainable energy sources into usable power, such as electricity, will be similarly affected in the same manner as fossil fuels. As mentioned at the start of Section 1.3 , there are many critical materials that need to be used in the green devices which will enable the transition to sustainable sources to be made and the CO2  problem to be addressed. These include the need for lithium and cobalt for EV batteries, tellurium for solar PV panels, dysprosium for wind turbines, palladium for fuel cells (Lim, 2020 ). There are insufficient reserves of these commodities and additional mining operations will likely be necessary to extract the ores necessary to increase the proved reserves. Other rare-earth minerals are necessary components of more than 200 products across a wide range of applications, especially high-tech consumer products, such as cellular telephones, computer hard drives, medical equipment, and so on (AGI, 2022 ). The reserves of some of these rare earth minerals could run out in less than 100 years (Hayes, 2020 ). One of the biggest challenges for engineers in the future will be the acquisition of sufficient engineering materials to ensure sustainability in general, and that the SDGs in particular, can be achieved.  1.3.5 Sustainability versus planned obsolescence While Engineering organizations believe that engineers can contribute significantly to a sustainable future it should not be forgotten that the engineering culture, especially in the manufacturing industry and to some extent in the construction industry, is planned obsolescence (Hadhazy, 2016b ; Wikipedia, 2022g ). This culture has been driven by business decisions largely made in the interest of profit, but not without reason. Although the replacement of worn-out items will always be necessary, such as with energy convertors and household appliances, manufacturers could make the devices last longer, but the initial cost to the consumer will likely be much higher and, for some, not affordable. One of the continuing fears is that so-called competitors will collude, that is, form cartels, to control particular markets. These fears are based in realities starting with the significant reduction of the lifetimes of lightbulbs in the early 20th century so that consumers would buy more, and yearly changes in car models, fashion, periodic changes in cell-phones, operating system software, and so on (Hadhazy, 2016b ; Wikipedia, 2022g ). Arguably some of these changes are the result of technology upgrades, improved energy use efficiencies and new capabilities but, as companies will eventually no longer support older versions of their devices, the sense of planned obsolescence persists even if it is often invisible and rarely questioned. For example, in 2020, 1.4 billion smart-phones were sold, the majority of them as upgrades to perfectly functional phones (Goldmark, 2021 ). However, if devices of all descriptions lasted forever there would be no need to manufacture more, or many more. Employment and any push for innovation would be significantly reduced with accompanying detrimental effects on global societies. Planned obsolescence, even if hidden from general awareness, is then not only an element of engineering cultures but also a societal norm and, in many instances, represents usual business practice. The major conflict between sustainable development and planned obsolescence is the generation of waste associated with the latter approach which, in terms of electronic and solar PV panel waste, is expensive to recycle especially when designated as hazardous. Governments are now attempting to legislate against planned obsolescence, largely because of the waste issue, but also to promote the concept of sustainability. In general, the following definition is used for legislative purposes: “Planned or programmed obsolescence refers to the deliberate shortening of a product's useful life by the manufacturer in order to increase consumption ” (Sustainability For All. (n.d.). July 13, 2022 ).   1.4 Concluding remarks Following the formation of the United Nations in 1945, after the end of the Second World War, the need for universal efforts to ensure the well-being of all was formally recognized by the member states of the United Nations. The philosophy of improving human development by economic growth and addressing societal injustices soon emerged and for two decades appeared to be on a pathway to success but it soon became obvious that the actions being taken had severe limitations. As the global population increased the need to address the deficiencies also increased as did environmental awareness. Six decades after the advent of the United Nations the quest for new enlightened approaches to human development resulted in the 2015 universal adoption of 17 sustainable development goals with defined measurable targets. None of these targets explicitly mentioned engineering but, for example, the connections between the human rights to access clean water, clean affordable energy, and adequate housing, appeared to be obvious. However, as the discussions in this chapter have shown, hopefully, although there is a vast body of literature explaining why and what engineering should and could contribute to sustainable development there is not a similar range dealing with “how” this is to be done. It has also been highlighted that sustainable development is based on three pillars, social, economic, and environmental and the methods of tracking progress of the goals of Agenda 2030, the indicators, reflect these pillars. However, SDG measurement methodologies rely on surveys, questionnaires and consumer demand statistics, techniques largely unfamiliar to engineers, or at least rarely used in engineering activities. The published tracking data cannot be taken at face value by engineers lacking detailed knowledge of these methodologies. Although this deficiency can be addressed by attendance at professional development courses and by self-learning there is no doubt that post-secondary education curricula need to include “engineering for sustainability” across all technical education offerings. Sustainable Engineering and, to some extent, Environmental Engineering programs deal with some aspects of sustainability and maybe the SDGs, but all shades of engineers need a sound basis of the fundamental principles involved and how the three pillars will likely impact engineering contributions to sustainable development.
