                  Poverty, widening income inequality, and environmental degradation are very critical challenges to sustainable development while in the light of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), these challenges have been addressed in numerous past empirical studies. However, increasing environmental degradation is a big constraint in the path of sustainable development, poverty alleviation, and controlling income inequality as well. Hence, in this study, we empirically investigate the theoretically ambiguous and complex relationship between poverty, income inequality, and ecological footprint (EFP) for 18 Asian developing countries over the period 2006–2017. Empirical results obtained from the Driscoll–Kraay (D–K) standard error approach confirmed that poverty headcount contributing to environmental degradation in terms of EFP. Further, widening income inequality has a detrimental and harmful effect on the environment in Asian developing countries. The findings of this study also confirm the inverted U-shaped Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC-Hypothesis) for investigated countries under the D–K methodology. This study provides some important policy implications for policymakers in the light of SDGs and Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for the investigated region.

Author(s) Country/region Periods Methodology Results   (Baloch et al., 2020a ) 46-Sub-Saharan African developing countries 2010–2016 Driscoll–Kraay (D–K) standard error approach The findings suggest that a trade-off situation exists between poverty and EFP in Sub-Saharan African countries.  (Bhattacharya, 2020 ) Panel of 14 states/provinces of India 1981–2014 Several regression methods The findings of the study showed a negative and insignificant impact of income inequality on environmental pollution before liberalization: conversely, after liberalization, the empirical study found a significant and positive relationship between income inequality and environmental quality.  (Chen et al., 2017 ) Chinese Economy 1997–2014 Carbon emissions’ Gini index (CEG) For productions units and residential units, a declining trend have been observed in CEG. However, CEG is found greater for production units while the effect of spatial CEG is subject to the type of energy that is used in both production and residential units of China.  (Danish and Wang, 2019 ) N-eleven economies 1971–2014 Mean Group-Common Correlated Effect (MG-CCE) The findings suggest that rapid growth in urbanization leads to increases EFP, But the moderation effect between economic growth and urbanization reduces EFP.  (Danish et al., 2019 ) Economy of Pakistan 1971–2014 ARDL The study suggests that both bio-capacity and economic growth increase EFP, while there is no causality between economic growth and EFP.  (Demir et al., 2019 ) Turkey 1963–2011 Auto-regressive Distributive Lag (ARDL) model The findings of the empirical study revealed that income inequality significantly and negatively influence the environmental pollution. Meaning that tapered the income gap worsens the quality of the environment.  (Dhrifi et al., 2020 ) Least developed countries 1995–2017 Three Sages Least Square (3SLS) Reported that there is a trade-off between poverty and the quality of the environment. While FDI significantly reduces poverty.  (Hassan et al., 2019 ) Economy of Pakistan 1970–2014 Auto-regressive distributive Lag (ARDL) model The findings obtained from ARDL co-integration confirmed that natural resources increases environmental degradation in term of ecological footprint  (Islam and Ghani, 2018 ) ASEAN economies 1995–2014 A simple linear regression model There is a positive relationship of poverty with environmental pollution and consumption of energy.  (Jin et al., 2018 ) Chinese economy 2007–2014 Three-Stages Least Square (3-SLS) Method The nexus between poverty and employment is negative, while in the primary, secondary, and agriculture sectors this relationship is positive.  (Khan, 2019 ) ASEAN economies 2007–2017 GMM The extreme poverty level harming the quality of the environment, however, utilization of environmentally friendly energy could help to alleviate extreme poverty.  (Khan and Yahong, 2021a ) Pakistan 1971–2015 Linear and Non-linear ARDL models Increasing levels of poverty, population, and economic growth increase environmental pollution in the long as well as in the short-run. While income inequality has no impact on environmental degradation in the short-run.  (Koçak et al., 2019 ) 46-developing countries of Sub-Saharan Africa 2010–2016 Quantile regression approach Revealed that energy consumptions and more access to electricity significantly reduces the intensity of extreme poverty level, but at the same time it degrading the quality of the environment  (Masud et al., 2018 ) ASEAN economies 1985–2015 Panel regression and Granger-causality tests The overall impact of income inequality on environmental quality was reported as mixed while the reverse causality exists between them for the bottom 40%.  (Ota, 2017 ) 20 Asian developing economies 1990–2000 Trend Analysis The different empirical findings were found from multitudinous surveys between income inequality and environmental pollution.  (Padhan et al., 2019 ) N-eleven economies 1971–2013 Panel Co-integration econometric approach The empirical evidence found that income inequality and environmental have a positive association in the Next-11 countries  (Remuzgo and Sarabia, 2015 ) Data from all the regions of the world 1990–2010 Many regression approaches and Theil index for income inequality The empirical results of the study confirmed a 22% decreasing trend in global income inequality and carbon emissions during the estimated period.  (Rizk and Slimane, 2018 ) The group of 145 economies 1996–2014 Various panel regression approaches The findings of the study confirmed the asymmetric relationship between poverty and environmental pollution  (Ulucak and Bilgili, 2018 ) Low, middle, and high-income economies 1961–2013 Continuously Update and Fully Modified (CUP) and Bias-correlated (BC) The findings confirmed U-shaped EKC-hypothesis in many countries that accounting for the ecological footprint as one of the most important indicator of environmental pollution.

Poverty, widening income inequality, and environmental degradation are very critical challenges to sustainable development while in the light of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), these challenges have been addressed in numerous past empirical studies. However, increasing environmental degradation is a big constraint in the path of sustainable development, poverty alleviation, and controlling income inequality as well. Hence, in this study, we empirically investigate the theoretically ambiguous and complex relationship between poverty, income inequality, and ecological footprint (EFP) for 18 Asian developing countries over the period 2006–2017. Empirical results obtained from the Driscoll–Kraay (D–K) standard error approach confirmed that poverty headcount contributing to environmental degradation in terms of EFP. Further, widening income inequality has a detrimental and harmful effect on the environment in Asian developing countries. The findings of this study also confirm the inverted U-shaped Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC-Hypothesis) for investigated countries under the D–K methodology. This study provides some important policy implications for policymakers in the light of SDGs  and Millennium Development Goals (MDGs ) for the investigated region.

Alleviation of extreme poverty and increasing income inequality in its all forms everywhere, along with environmental pollution are the top priorities and main concerns of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (Jomehpour, 2017 ). Though sensible and functional efforts have been instigated to accomplish the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for the reduction of poverty and income inequality, nevertheless, in the majority of developing countries the rate of poverty along with income inequality is still high. However, finding the solutions to reduce extreme poverty and income inequality along with environmental protection are complex and challenging issues for developed as well as for developing countries. One of the conceivable solutions to formulate such policies that accelerate economic growth as it is generally believed that economic growth is favorable for the reduction of poverty (Akinlo and Dada, 2021 ). In the meantime, the higher economic growth also rise income inequality and increase stress on ecological processes and resources. This creates a more complex nexus and challenging situation. The economic growth might be cooperative in the alleviation of poverty, particularly if it is not linked with increasing income inequality and environmental pollution. Many environmentalists believed that the nexus between poverty and environmental pollution along with income inequality is paradoxical and inconsistent. The alleviation of extreme poverty, increasing income inequality, and environmental degradation is like “killing two birds with one stone” (Dhrifi et al., 2020; Masron and Subramaniam, 2019 ). Therefore, to secure a sustainable future for the next generation, it is important to understand theoretically ambiguous issues of poverty, income inequality, and environmental pollution. Issues related to environmental degradation, poverty, and income inequality have been subject to widespread debates and therefore have gained extensive attention. In the past few years, the complexity and significance of the nexus between poverty, income inequality, and the quality of the environment have been progressively highlighted in the literature of environmental economics and sustainability. In recent years, it has been contended that poverty and income inequalities are substantial drivers and the main factors of environmental pollution, particularly in developing countries (Gulzar et al., 2020 ). In developing countries, most of the people live under vulnerable conditions while it is a challenge to achieve the UN’s goals of sustainable development. Therefore, this study is based on developing countries (mostly from Asia) because these economies are still trying to raise the quality of life of their vulnerable people by encouraging economic development, reduce poverty, and all kinds of inequalities. Higher economic growth targeting to reduce the extreme level of poverty is causing higher consumption of energy and thus environmental quality in developing countries because mostly the structure of energy supply is based on fossil fuels (Papakonstantinidis, 2017 ). However, the nexus between poverty and ecological pollution along with income inequality is still inconclusive and has been ignored by the developing world including developing countries of Asia. The degradation of the environment might place a substantial impact, as the majority of developing economies are extremely vulnerable and having less capability to counter the negative impact of the environment (Apergis et al., 2018; Awodumi and Adewuyi, 2020 ). From the last few years, the negative impact of environmental pollution and climate change in response to accelerated economic activities are expected to be more severe in the developing world, particularly in Asian countries (Kong and Khan, 2019 ). The majority of economies in Asia are emerging and growing progressively, but it still contains poor regions of the world. Many economists have observed that under the prevailing economic situation, the extreme level of poverty might not be reduced in the majority of countries in Asia by 2030; but, policymakers can alleviate it by accelerating economic growth and equal income distribution to deprived regions. Because of increasing income inequality, many Asian countries could not reduce extreme poverty and failed to achieve Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) (Ullah and Awan, 2019 ). Notwithstanding, serious steps made to reduce the extreme poverty level but more than 40% of Asia’s economies are still a victim and target of poverty, the lack of basic facilities of life such as food security, low-income growth, poor health condition, lack of education, and safe drinking water (Jain, 2019; Parker and Bhatti, 2020; Yahong and Khan, 2021 ). Although the global poverty rate dramatically decreased from 94% to 10.7% during the last two centuries. Nevertheless, the Asian’s countries (particularly south Asian’s countries) share to global poverty has increased from 27.3% (1990) % to 33.4% (2013), sendoff behind only to sub-Saharan Africa which accounts for 51% (the largest share) to global poverty level (Bourguignon and Morrisson, 2002 ). However, the association between income inequality and the quality of the environment is still questionable. In the globe, the majority of poor countries belong to Asia, which are facing the problem of income inequality and at the same time environmental pollution along with low economic growth and development. Because of progressive growth in the industrialization process, many countries in the region are suffering from serious issues of environmental pollution as the emissions of toxic (such as carbon dioxide) increase the air pollution and waste the quality of water. Moreover, numerous economies are agrarian, therefore the higher usage of fertilizers and pesticides also disturb the quality of water (ground-water) very badly. Similarly, lack of afforestation in the majority of countries in Asia and higher population growth along with urbanization further worsen the quality of the environment. Regarding the unequal distribution of income, it accelerates a miscellaneous effect on many social and economic classes of the regions (La Rovere, 2017 ). The most underprivileged general public of the region gets affected the most from income inequality as these underprivileged people of the society are an extremely vulnerable and susceptible part of the region. Income inequality might leads to less protection to the quality of the environment and in the long run responsible for higher toxic emissions because it could generate problems in the policy of environmental protection (Grottera et al., 2017 ). Meanwhile, many past research studies in the literature argued that fair distribution of income support environmental protections, and at the same time environment can be one of the most important factor in the reduction of extreme poverty (Cho, 2018 ). The presence of natural resources in the environment could help to reduce extreme poverty by providing good health conditions, increase food security, and generating handsome income in the field of economic activities. It also indirectly raises the morbidity and rate of mortality of poor people (Kim et al., 2019 ). Alternatively, the quality of the environment could be improved by reducing extreme poverty, mainly in developing economies of the region. It is observed that poverty and the quality of the environment are strongly related because poor people are mostly dependent on environmental and natural resources. The dependence on natural resources, less-privileged misused and manipulate the quality of natural resources in an unmaintainable manner that further aggravating pollution and quality of the environment (Tan, 2017 ). Moreover, extreme poverty along with urbanization and high population growth deteriorates the absorbing capacity and reduces the quality of environmental and natural resources (Schleicher et al., 2018 ). In the literature, we have found a few research studies that have argued the association between poverty and environmental pollution by incorporating carbon emissions (Co2E) as a proxy for pollution. Contrasting from the past researches, we aim to analyze the relationship between poverty and income inequality on environmental pollution by incorporating ecological footprint per capita (EFP) as a measure of pollution for the cross-panel of 18 Asian developing economies. The selection of EFP for environmental pollution because of that the influence of poverty and income inequality on the quality of the environment might not be limited to other environmental pollution proxies (such as Co2 etc.) (Baloch et al., 2020a; Yilanci and Pata, 2020 ). Conversely, the extreme rate of poverty might influence the quality of the environment at a higher level along with natural resources, for example, water, mining, soil, and forestry (Solarin and Bello, 2018 ). As we have discussed, the main aim of economic activities is to accelerate the reduction of poverty, which leads to depleting environmentally friendly resources such as depletion of quality of the water, land, minerals, and forestry. Meanwhile, incorporation of Co2 emission as a measure for environmental pollution could only focus on a narrow aspect of environment quality and therefore, may not cover the main activities that are badly causing sustainability of the ecosystem. By analyzing human activities which influence the quality of the environment, EFP includes the total capability of the earth, and thus, has been used in many recent research studies because EFP is a complete and wide-ranging indicator of environmental quality (Abbas et al., 2021; Baloch et al., 2020a; Bello et al., 2018; Destek and Sinha, 2020; Huimin, 2013; Majeed et al., 2021; Ozcan et al., 2018 ; Solarin and Bello, 2019; Ulucak and Lin, 2017; Wackernagel et al., 2019; Zhiying and Cuiyan, 2011 ). According to Global Footprint Network (advancing the science of Sustainability), the EFP indicates the consumption of bio-capacity by a county’s inhabitants, while it is the most amenable to change by the individuals through changes in their consumption. It is also observed that EFP is an important measure that signifies the naturally productive capability areas around the world, the natural water and land areas required to absorb waste, and to what extend countries utilize biologically productive areas (Ansari et al., 2020; Wackernagel et al., 2017 ). For the analysis of the current study, we have selected a cross-country panel of 18 developing countries in Asia, and investigate the possible association between poverty, income inequality, and EFP (a proxy for environmental pollution). The selection of Asia is because of the reason that most of the poor people live in Asia. According to the statistic of World Bank (WB), Asia belongs to nearly 45% of the globe’s poorest people (32.9% live in South Asia and 9.1% live in East Asia and the Pacific), while more than 800 million people are extremely poor and live below the international poverty line (US$1.92 a day) (Baloch et al., 2020b ). At the same time, the largest emitter of Co2E in the world is Asia pacific, in 2019, about 18 billion metric tons of Co2E were recorded. In addition, China produced nearly 29% of the world’s Co2E, however, Australia, Canada, and the United States of America are the top three Co2 emitters in the world (Lee et al., 2018; Huijnen et al., 2016; Zaidi et al., 2019 ). The majority of people living below the poverty line in this region and are engaged with agriculture and mainly dependent on environmental resources. While poor people are not well educated, therefore most of the Asian economies failed to achieve the target of poverty reduction. Because of low education levels, mostly poor people degrading the quality of land along with deforestation because of the unsustainable practice of farming. Certainty, the impact of poverty along with income inequality on environmental pollution has seemed within or beyond our expectations (Masron and Subramaniam, 2019 ). To the best of our knowledge, the current study adds to the existing literature in the following numerous ways. • No research so far critically conducted the relationship between poverty, income inequality, and EFP. In the past recent the research work of Baloch et al. (2020a)  and Khan and Yahong (2021b)  have only empirically investigated the trade-off between poverty, and EFP for 46 Sub-Saharan African countries. The investigation of the current study was inspired by the work of Baloch et al. (2020a)  and Khan and Yahong (2021b)  to incorporate EFP as a measure for environmental pollution instead of other measures such as Co2E etc. Along with other control variables, we have analyzed the influence of poverty, income inequality on EFP. In this manner, as per our knowledge, the present study would be new and influential towards struggles regarding the reduction of poverty and income gap along with environmental sustainability.  • No single research study has been empirically conducted on the relationship between poverty, income inequality, and EFP by focusing on the panel of developing countries in Asia. In the light of the study objective, this study seeks to answer this research questions that, what impact do poverty and income inequality have on the ecological footprint in the context of Asian developing economies. This study indeed would fill the above-mentioned research gap, while we believe that this study could provide valuable insight.  • For the analysis of the current study, we have incorporated the most recent and advanced econometric techniques of “Driscoll and Kraay” (1998) method or “D–K standard error panel regression model”. This method provides reliable and robust output.     2 Related literature In the past, several research studies focused on the impact of poverty and income inequality on environmental quality while the majority of studies that take CO2e as a measure of environmental quality and obtained significant outcomes. Many research studies have founded that poverty and income inequality degrading the quality of the environment, while some of the studies stated the negative impact of income inequality on environmental pollution. To better understand the impact of poverty and income inequality on environmental pollution, some of the past empirical studies are presented in Table 1 .  The rest of the research article is well organized as follows: Section 2  “Summary of related literature review” provides a very brief review of past research studies on the impact of poverty, income inequality, and environmental pollution in tabulated form. Section 3  “Material and Method” offers detailed of data and its sources, specification of the model, and estimated methodology. Section 4  “Results and Discussion” presents the empirical results and their interpretation while Section 5  “Conclusions” drown brief conclusions along with some policy implications.  3 Material and methods We have employed the panel data of 18 Asian developing countries from 2006–2017 (for a list of investigated countries, please see Appendix Table 4 ). The data for targeted variables have been collected from World Development Indicators (WDI), and other databases. The variables used in the regression model are per capita ecological footprint (EFP) as a measure for environmental degradation, poverty headcount ratio (poverty) as a measure for extreme poverty level, Gini coefficient (estimated by World Bank) as a proxy for income inequality, GDP per capita (constant 2010 US$) as a proxy for economic growth, foreign direct investment (FDI), annual population growth, Inflation (CPI annual %) access to electricity (calculated in percentage), Forest area (% of land area), and Manufacturing, value added (% of GDP). The current study considers EFP as a measure of environmental degradation based on the previous studies (Baloch et al., 2020a ; Hao et al. 2016; Hassan et al., 2019; Ulucak and Bilgili, 2018 ). The description and definition of the variables are given in Table 2 .  The data for mostly variables such as poverty, Gini, GDP, FDI, Pop, AE, FA, INF, and IND are collected from WDI while the data for EFP was collected from Global Footprint Network (GFN). For the measurement of environmental pollution, Rees (1992) developed EFP which include pollution due to overall consumption of human being with regenerative biological capacity. As we know, EFP captured the depletion of the environmental and natural resources because of economic activities and also directly measures the emission of pollution due to these economic activities. For example, accelerating the process of industrialization and manufacturing could be harmful but not always, but the EFP covers both the consumption effect and direct effect of production (Danish et al., 2019 ). The selection of study’s variables based on the SDGs objectives, i.e. the reduction of extreme poverty; narrow down the income gap; and protect the quality of environment (reduce environmental pollution); ensuring sustainable economic growth and development along with encouraging FDI; controlling population growth rate and unstable general price level; reducing energy consumption based on fossil fuel while encouraging renewable energy; controlling unproductive manufacturing to protect forest area and pollution (United Nations, 2015 ). For the analysis of panel data, we used D–K regression introduced by (Driscoll and Kraay, 1998 ). D–K standard error approach has been incorporated earlier in related research work of Baloch and Wang (2019), Khan (2020) . D–K standard error approach handles the problems of serial correlation, heteroscedasticity, and the most common problem of cross-sectional dependency (Baloch et al., 2020a,b ). In addition, the D–K standard error approach ensured and handles the most common issues of missing values while it is suitable for balanced as well as for unbalanced panel series. It permits a large dimension of time and flexibility by incorporating a non-parametric approach while generating a standard error however taking the mean of the product of predicted variable along with residual and applies the required value in a weighted Heteroskedasticity- and autocorrelation-consistent (HAC) approach. This approach is robust and reliable against cross-sectional dependencies. In summary, the current study takes advantage and incorporating D–K standard error algorithm for Pooled Ordinary Least Square (Pooled-OLS) technique through a multiple linear regression model which can be expressed as follow: E  i t   = β  0   + X  i t   β  1   + ɛ  i t       Where: i = 1 , 2 , 3 , … … , N , t = 1 , 2 , 3 , … , T   
 (N   represents panel of countries, while T   represents of years). E  i t     represents EFP (dependent variable); X  i t     comprises all independent variables (all independent variables mentioned in Table 2 ); and ɛ  i t     is the stochastic or random term in the model. The D–K standard error regression technique is the most common and suitable econometric method in the recent work of (Baloch et al., 2019; Khan, 2020; Danish et al., 2019 ).  4 Results and discussion To check the impact of poverty and income inequality on environmental pollution in terms of EFP in the panel of Asian developing countries, the study has applied the D–K regression approach. Besides, the variables used in the D–K panel model have been converted into log form; so that, the calculated coefficient of variables can be interpreted as elasticities in the long run. The analysis of the D–K regression model along with the interpretation of the current research study has been conducted in five models. In models 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, we use multiple control variables not only for sensitivity analysis but also to assess their impact on EFP.  Overall empirical results of Models 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of Table 3  show that poverty has a statistically significant and positive impact on EFP in the case of Asian developing countries. As shown in full model (Model 5) of Table 3 , a 1% (or a unit) increase in the level of poverty will push to an increase in EFP by 0.006% (or unit). These findings have proven and suggesting that some serious steps are required to take for the reduction of extreme poverty which is a responsible factor of environmental pollution in many Asian developing economies. In other words, an increase in the level of poverty would be degrading the quality of the environment in terms of EFP. There might be many possible interpretations for the positive relationship between poverty and environmental pollution. Firstly, the higher economic growth and industrialization process for alleviation of extreme poverty may negatively affect the quality of the environment. Such as, encouraging domestic industries is the most important factor to accelerate economic growth and eradicate the intensity of extreme poverty level; however, it degrading the quality of the environment (Jin et al., 2018 ). Secondly, the positive influence of poverty on environmental degradation is also justifiable for the developing countries of Asia. As, numbers of impoverished people exist in developing countries and they are use (misuse) natural and environmental resources such as natural food, water, and energy for their survival. The excessive usage of natural resources also leads to poor quality of the environment. According to the work of Broad and Cavanagh (2015) , the higher level of poverty is the main offender behind environmental pollution in the least developed countries, because of the unavailability off basic education facilities and less awareness about environmental protection. Consequently, impoverished people repeatedly misuse and exploit natural resources in an unsustainable way for their survival, and thus it leads to increase environmental pollution. Thirdly, one of the most important reason behind the positive impact of poverty on environmental pollution is that addressing environmental concerns need few economic compromises (control urbanization, industrialization, etc.) that are causing environmental pollution. However, these economic compromises could lead to slow the speed of economic growth and economic activities and thus, poverty remains an unresolved problem for the region (Dhrifi et al., 2020 ). The empirical results of the current study are in line with empirical findings of (Khan, 2019 ) for southeast Asian countries, Masron and Subramaniam (2019)  for developing countries, (Jin et al., 2018; Azam et al., 2019 ) for the Chinese Economy, and Baloch et al. (2020a, b)  and Kocak et al. (2014) for Sub-Saharan Africa countries. While our findings differ from the empirical result of Dhrifi et al. (2020)  for developing countries, and Islam and Ghani (2018)  for ASEAN economies. The empirical findings of the current study differ from some studies because of the unlike economic dynamics of the Asian region as compared to other regions of the globe. Besides, for the analysis of the current study, we have applied an advance regression approach (D–K standard error approach) to obtain a robust estimate. Regarding the impact of income inequality on environmental degradation, the empirical results are presented in all models (Models 1 to 5) of Table 3 . The estimated results of the Gini coefficient (income inequality) are statistically significant and positive even at a 5% level of significance. The positive effect of income inequality indicating that higher income inequality degrading environmental equality in Asian developing countries. Particularly, according to Model 5 (full model), a 1% increase in the Gini index would contribute with a 0.037% increase in EFP. The current findings of our empirical analysis offer some evidence that the Gini index of income inequality and ecological footprint are strongly related. Therefore, it could be concluded that higher income inequality is one of the main reason that increase environmental pollution in terms of EFP in Asian developing countries. One of the important justification could be that widening income inequality (Gini index) in less developed economies may increase the rate of illiteracy and decreases Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) of general people to buy environmentally friendly and energy-saving goods (sources). Consequently, lack of education, low PPP, and less awareness leads to increase consumption of non-renewable energy and thus higher environmental pollution in terms of EFP. Many researchers have also confirmed the positive relationship between income inequality and environmental pollution. For example, Boyce (1994)  hypothesized and confirmed that higher income gap between rich and poor creates further power gap in a society and that could be the main cause of environmental pollution. Because the poor people of the society cannot take the advantage of the environmental quality and all environmental costs are imposed on them. This theoretical position and empirical findings of Liu et al. (2019)  also urged that widening income gap cause individualism and consumerism which is a very serious and big problem in the way of worthy environment. With increasing the gap between rich and poor, deprived people misuse and exploit environmentally friendly resources for their survival. Therefore, this phenomenon suggests that widening income gap is not just an economic and social issue but also related to environmental quality. The empirical findings of the current study are in line with the empirical work of Bae (2018)  for G-20 economies, Baloch et al. (2018)  for Pakistan, Baloch et al. (2020b)  for 46 sub-Saharan Africa countries Knight et al. (2017) for high-income economies, Masud et al. (2018)  for five ASEAN economies, and Liu et al. (2019) ; Zhang and Zhao (2014) for Chinese economy. Similarly, the current results contradict the work of Demir et al. (2019)  for the emerging economy of Turkey, and Grunewald et al. (2017)  for middle-income and low-income economies. According to our observation, the current contradiction in our research is due to the utilization of advance method (D–K standard error method) as mentioned above, and another contradiction with our study is because the dataset incorporated in the current research is different i.e. developing countries of Asia. As shown in models 1 to 5 of Table 3 , the association between GDP per capita (proxy for economic growth) and EFP are statistically significant and positive. Explicitly in Model 5 (full model), a 1% increase in economic growth will escalate EFP by 0.739%, thus suggesting that the GDP per capita of developing economies in Asia increases environmental pollution. From this empirical evidence, it could be easily concluded that the higher economic growth in Asian countries is helpful to defeat the extreme level of poverty but with high environmental costs (environmental degradation). Our empirical results are in line with the empirical findings of Behera and Dash (2017)  for developing and middle-income economies, Naz et al. (2019)  for the economy of Pakistan, and Zhang and Zhang (2018)  for the Chinese economy. In addition, the GDP per capita square (square of economic growth) has a negative and statistically significant impact on EFP, which provides evidence about the presence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC-hypothesis). This hypothesis documented that economic development and growth leads to environmental degradation at the initial stage, but after a certain level of growth, society begins its relationship with the environment, and the degree of environmental degradation decreases. Our current outcome and EKC-hypothesis are supported by previous research work, for example, the work of Bölük and Mert (2015)  for Turkey, Baek (2016)  for the United States of America, Lee and Oh (2015)  for China, Ali et al. (2017)  for Malaysia, (Chen et al., 2019 ) for Pakistan, and Usman et al. (2019)  for India also supported the presence of EKC-hypothesis. To minimize omitted variable bias, in this study we have incorporated and controlled for several important environment-influencing factors, while some of them were emphasized for the first time. However, the relationship between other control variables and environmental degradation are presented in Models 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of Table 3  as follow: (I) Inflation (INF) has a negative and statistically insignificant impact on EFP.  (II) Forest area (FA) has a significantly negative effect on EFP  (III) Foreign direct investment (FDI) has a positive and statistically significant effect on EFP.  (IV) Population growth (Pop) has an insignificant relationship with EFP.  (V) Access to electricity (AE) has an insignificant effect on EFP.  (VI) Manufacture value added (IND) has a positive but insignificant effect on EFP.    It is important to declare that this study also used D–K standard error (panel regression) approach for all control variables to test the validity and reliability of the main variables’ empirical findings. The empirical results obtained from Model 1 (without control variables) are in line with Model 5 (with control variables) and confirm the robustness of our findings.  5 Conclusion and policy implications The current study evaluates the impact of poverty and income inequality on environmental degradation in term of ecological footprint by using panel data of 18-developing countries in Asia from 2006 to 2017. For this purpose, advance econometric techniques of the D–K standard error model are employed to inspect empirical association among the variables of the study. Contrasting past related research studies on developing countries, this is the new study, which provides important insight on simultaneous targets of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), while provides empirical evidence on the effect of poverty and income inequality on environmental degradation. By employing D–K regression approach, the empirical results indicate that poverty headcount increases environmental degradation in terms of ecological footprint (EFP) in developing countries of Asia. Moreover, the Gini index of income inequality is also an important environment-influencing factor in developing countries of Asia. The findings also suggest that GDP per capita (economic growth) in Asian developing countries is an important factor in environmental degradation, while these findings support the existence of EKC-hypothesis in these countries. Estimated findings obtained from D–K regression suggest both higher rate of poverty along with widening income gap contributes to environmental pollution in developing countries of Asia, therefore some economic policies should be formulated to reduce higher level of extreme poverty and narrow down widening income inequality without deteriorating the quality of the environment. Thus, policies regarding poverty alleviation might have to further increase the income gap and environmental pollution in terms of EFP. Regarding policy implications, first, developing countries of Asia should not depend only on greater GDP per capita (economic growth), but they should handle the complex economic situation by providing immediate social relief through employment opportunities to poor people, increase micro financial support, and other social safety nets. The findings confirmed that income inequality is harmful to the environment, therefore the selected countries should ensure equal income distribution policies to tackle harmful environmental effects caused by unequal income distribution. Second, environmental pollution can be controlled if the concerned authorities of targeted countries implement some policies that individuals from the upper class should not transfer their income/wealth into EFP. For example, the government of developing countries should provide special services for these people to use environmentally friendly technologies (renewable energy technology) that can sustainably fulfill their energy demand. Third, to handle complex situation of poverty and income inequality along with environmental pollution requires a long-run economic tactic that boosts economic growth, sustainable economic development (pro-poor policies), increase opportunities for economic activities, and control the environmental vulnerability. For that reason, the concerned authorities of Asian developing countries should devise comprehensive and wide-ranging policies that ensure the gains from economic growth must benefiting the poor and needy people of the region. As the higher economic growth, rapid urbanization, and industrialization in Asian counties are badly affect the environment, so, the policymakers should not only pay attention to high economic growth but also focus on environmental quality. Therefore, the state’s policy should implement environmental regulation and should ensure the use of environmentally friendly energy. Regarding environmental regulations, it significantly stimulates technological innovation procedure that would lead to rise efficiency of energy production and thereby mitigate environmental pollution. Additionally, the empirical findings of the study highlight the significance of the equal distribution of income along with sustainable economic growth to accomplish Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Under the umbrella of many economic corridors, the investigated region should emphasize more and more on expanding its energy mix, with a higher percentage towards clean/environmental-friendly (renewable energy), and ensure that this energy consumption does not harm the quality of the environment. Whereas, Emission Trading Approach (ETS), and imposing taxation on emissions like Carbon Pricing Approach (CPA) can provide additional revenue and facilitate in reduction of poverty and environmental pollution. The investigated countries should form a favorable policy to encourage residential consumers and industrialists towards green investment like tax allowances on purchase or import of environmentally friendly technology (energy efficient) and energy. The public sector along with the private sector of the investigated region should also devise a policy that allows economical credits to residential consumers and industrialists for setup environmentally friendly energy such as solar energy. The installation of solar energy will not only mitigate the problem of energy shortage but will also overcome environmental degradation. Although the empirical results are significant for policymakers of the targeted region, but with some limitations, that must be taken into account for future research studies. For example, we were failed to assess the multi-regional-wise poverty and income inequality effect on environmental pollution due to the unavailability of data. The current study has incorporated the Gini index for income inequality and EFP for Environmental degradation, thus, the future researcher could also focus on the impact of poverty and income inequality on environmental degradation by incorporating other indicators. Using other indicators would extend the study objective and verify whether the empirical results obtained in this study are robust to other indicators of poverty, income inequality, and environmental pollution. Further, the current research could be motivation and leave the gap for future studies to investigate similar relationships for other Least Develop Countries (LDCs). Finally, in this study we failed to find the causality among the variables of the study due to the unavailability of the extended dataset, therefore, it could be better and more interesting to emphasize this limitation in the future.
