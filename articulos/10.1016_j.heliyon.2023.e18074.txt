                  In recent years, China has made tremendous progress. The general quality of living of the population has risen. As the China economy grows, so too will the middle class, laying the groundwork for the expansion of the sports business. At the same time, reaching a certain level of success in the sports sector would benefit the economy. In some Western developed nations, for instance, the sports industry's economic impact has already surpassed that of the traditional economy. The economy has reached a new plateau because of it. The sports business in China has matured to a certain extent, but it is still in its infancy. The growth of the sports business has not been without its share of challenges. In this paper, we focus on how the sports sector in China contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. To begin, the foreign sports industry's growth process, development status, influencing factors, and existing issues were compared and analyzed in order to gain insight into its conditions, characteristics, and contribution to economic growth. This research also explores the role of the sports industry from 1990 to 2020. This study considers the determinants of carbon emission (CO2): GDP per capita, technological development, social globalization, energy consumption, and the sports industry. The study employs the unit root test, ARDL bound test, AARDL estimation, NARDL test, and MTNARDL test to check the outcomes of variables in this analysis. The effect of GDP per capita, technological development, social globalization, energy consumption, and the sports industry has a positive and negative impact on carbon emission (CO2) in China. In terms of outcomes, this study suggests how a country can maximize green economic growth.

The general quality of living of the population has risen. As the China economy grows, so too will the middle class, laying the groundwork for the expansion of the sports business. At the same time, reaching a certain level of success in the sports sector would benefit the economy. In some Western developed nations, for instance, the sports industry's economic impact has already surpassed that of the traditional economy. The economy has reached a new plateau because of it. The sports business in China has matured to a certain extent, but it is still in its infancy. The growth of the sports business has not been without its share of challenges. In this paper, we focus on how the sports sector in China contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. To begin, the foreign sports industry's growth process, development status, influencing factors, and existing issues were compared and analyzed in order to gain insight into its conditions, characteristics, and contribution to economic growth. This research also explores the role of the sports industry from 1990 to 2020. This study considers the determinants of carbon emission (CO2): GDP per capita, technological development, social globalization, energy consumption, and the sports industry. The study employs the unit root test, ARDL bound test, AARDL estimation, NARDL test, and MTNARDL test to check the outcomes of variables in this analysis. The effect of GDP per capita, technological development, social globalization, energy consumption, and the sports industry has a positive and negative impact on carbon emission (CO2) in China. In terms of outcomes, this study suggests how a country can maximize green economic growth.   Keywords CO2  Sports industry  Technological innovation  Energy use  Social globalization  China    1 Introduction After more than 40 years of steady development thanks to reform and opening-up, the China region is now among the most powerful in the world. However, this process has also contributed to the emergence of critical societal and environmental issues [1 ]. In 2020, China's economy accounted for 17% of the global GDP. Footnote1 According to the World Energy Yearbook 2020, China was responsible for 75% of the net rise in worldwide energy consumption. China also ranked 120th on the environmental performance index (EPI) out of 180 countries and regions. Although the economic development scenario has changed dramatically in recent years thanks to the new development concept's leadership, China's economic growth has not been spared the perils of excessive energy use, emissions, and pollution [2 ] (see Fig. 1  ). Meanwhile, China's economic development momentum gradually lacked, leading to a decline in growth [3 ]. High-quality economic development has been severely hampered by the outdated concept of development that trades the environment and resources for expansion [4 ]. Finding an appropriate development mode to support the transition from rapid growth to quality development is essential for achieving sustainable economic development [5 ]. Green economic growth can address the challenges of economic transformation and upgrading, lessen resource and environmental constraints, and build a bridge between the proverbial “mountains of gold and silver” and the “lucid waters and lush mountains.” However, the question of how to attain green economic growth presents a significant obstacle for the China economy at present. In sustainable development, “green economic growth” is recommended for economic and environmental harmony. The term “sports industry” can be defined using either its broad or narrow sense. The term “sports industry” can have two distinct meanings: in its broadest sense, it refers to the collection of businesses that engage in the creation and sale of sports goods; in its narrowest sense, it refers only to the provision of sports-related services [6 ]. The National Bureau of Statistics and the General Administration of Sport of China collaborated to create a statistical classification of the sports industry [7 ], which defines the sports industry as “a set of production activities that offer various sports products (goods and services)" [8 ]. The need for sports products and services is rising rapidly in response to the rising number of people engaging in sporting activities [9 ]. According to an analysis of sports industry studies, more investigation is being poured into the following topics: the value chain of sports products; government support for the sports industry; the benefits of the place of growth in the sports industry; the role of technology in the sports industry; and the impact of the successful growth of people's living standards on the strength of the Asian sports industry [10 ]. Despite worldwide economic volatility and growing rivalry, and with restrictions on resource use due to global climate change, there is a chance for study in the regional growth from a single economic growth to social security, safeguarding of the environment, etc. [11 ]. The sports industry's continued health and SD can be predicted based on studies that take a variety of perspectives (Kirikkaleli and Adebayo, [12 ]. The sports business's state and its role in the new millennium's economic and social growth have been studied. The sports economy, which includes all business dealings connected to athletics, is a byproduct of historical social and economic growth [13 ]. The sports economy, or the economic activity generated by people's participation in athletics and the industries that serve them [14 ]. America and some western European nations, among others, rely heavily on the sports economy to boost their social economies [15 ]. In these advanced nations, the commercial activities of the sports economy, such as European football and the NBA league, have reached a mature stage of development. But our nation is behind the curve regarding the sports concept and economic development theory [16 ]. The development of the regional economy is the foundation for the expansion of the sports industry, and the expansion of the sports industry is a crucial instrument for fostering the expansion of the regional society and economy, as demonstrated by a number of studies. Consequently, examining the sporting products industry's SD through economics and commerce is not sufficient. It's also important to consider things like societal and environmental factors. Finally, it's worth noting that there aren't many reviews of artificial neural networks for SD or analyses of the structure of sports prediction models, or studies predicting the cost of sports building using neural networks [17 ]. A quantitative study was performed to evaluate and analyze the China sports industry's predictions of healthy and SD [18 ]. The findings indicated a generally upward tendency in the degrees of the health of the Chinese industry's potential, the sports industry's trustworthy health, and the sports industry's supportive environment. Over the next decade, China will maintain a thriving healthcare sector, and by 2021 and 2024, the actual and potential health of the sports sector will also have improved. But the ecosystem that sustains the sports business is consistently in terrible shape. No in-depth analysis of the impact of SD's many variables has been performed on the athletics business. The new force behind economic growth is the booming sports industry, which occupies a gradually significant strategic place in national economic and social development. The sports industry strives to integrate sports with ecological protection, resource use, and other organic ideas as part of its mission [19 ]. Sustainable development, and societal harmony as guiding principles in order to become a green, dawning industry. Admirable ecological atmosphere opinion for the people involved in sports activities creates a win-win situation, according to the sports industry, which emphasizes the importance of decreasing energy use, saving resources, and increasing the protection of environmental balance [3 ]. The government is also investing heavily in the sports business, which it views as an essential component in the new period's vital training for China and a noteworthy guide in creating environmental civilization. However, there is a shortage of literature on how the convergence of the sports business affects green economic expansion. Explaining the link between sports industry consolidation and environmental sustainability is vital for laying the groundwork for the green economy's expansion and the sports industry's continued success. As the sports business grows, it will be affected by a wide range of variables [20 ]. Different countries and sports have experienced varying growth in the sports business. Given the global nature of the sports industry (NBA, World Cup, and other sports events), the study of sports economic growth has concerned the attention of an increasing number of academics and sports industry developers [21 ]. No longer is it restricted to the country or a niche in the sports business. Long-term success stories in the sports business can be aided by carefully managing the interdependencies between various factors in sports economics. With the globalization of the sports business comes the emergence of very complex data in sports economic management [22 ,23 ]. Relying exclusively on employees of sports industry companies to process this data is challenging because of the complex relationships between these data. The growth of businesses in the sports sector is tied to more than just the bottom line, including things like marketing, product sales, and publicity [24 ]. Similarly, as people's standard of living rises, their interest in sports expands beyond just engaging in physical activity themselves to include following their favorite teams, players, coaches, etc., which in turn fuels the growth of stadium facilities and revenues and the sales of related sports merchandise [25 ]. This also includes the stock growth rate of major corporations in the sports business. Following is a synopsis of the paper's most significant findings. This paper tries to estimate the influence of the sports sector on CO2 emissions in China, focusing on the countries with the highest carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions due to oil production. This study uses economic development, technological development, sports industry, energy consumption, and social globalization as independent variables, while carbon emission is the dependent variable. Second, this original contribution to the literature uses multiple autoregressive distributed lags (ARDL) techniques to investigate the sports industry's possible effects on greenhouse gas production. Further, the NARDL model with a single threshold is not adaptable in identifying variations in the independent variable, as stated by Awosusi et al. [26 ]. In light of this assertion, the MTNARDL models are employed in this work to provide us with the flexibility to employ multiple thresholds. In addition, the ARDL bound test and the unit root test are used in this research. That is to say, when utilizing the MTNARDL model estimation, decision-makers have various options regarding strategies and methods to deal with any possible imbalance. The rest of the paper is divided into five parts. The first is an introduction that provides a high-level summary of the sports business and carbon emissions. A literature overview is presented in Section 2 , followed by information on the research's methodology and data in Section 3 . The fourth part presents the model and the empirical findings, while the fifth and sixth parts present the discussion and the policy implications.  2 Literature reviews Concerns about environmental degradation, resource depletion, and the possibility of stunted economic development have prompted widespread discussion of “green economic growth” and “green growth.”. Green economy has been defined in some detail by various studies and organizations [27 ]. It has been adopted as a unifying strategic idea by a number of international organizations. Li et al. [28 ] defined green growth and outlined its major implications. Transitioning to a green economy has been shown by Ali et al. [29 ] to be effective in cutting pollution and conserving materials. Liu et al. [24 ] discovered that green growth was understood to have three goals: economic development, ecological protection, and employment generation. Hailiang et al. [30 ] used an energy input-output analysis to forecast Canada's green development potential across a range of scenarios. Green development effectiveness in 285 Chinese cities was assessed by Song et al. [31 ]. The green growth gap between various resource-based Chinese cities was discussed by Wan et al. [32 ]. The variables that promote sustainable development have been the subject of numerous studies. The status of China's green economy was assessed at the city level by Mikhno et al. [33 ], who attributed sector variations to population alterations, future educational opportunities, and other socioeconomic factors. Using the NDDF technique, Lee and Lee et al. [16 ] created a green development growth indicator for 30 provinces in China. The quantile method was then used to examine how changes in the gaps between the best practices, technology, and efficiencies affected green growth. Using statistics on individual Chinese cities, J. Zhao et al. [9 ] examined how plenty of natural resources affect environmentally friendly development. They found evidence for the “resource curse,” or the hypothesis that areas rich in natural resources are more likely to experience ecological deterioration. Taghizadeh-hesary and Musibau et al [34 ]. used data from China's provinces to determine the low-carbon economy index via the directional distance function. Then they used a panel vector auto-regression model to observe the variables contributing to this index. The green growth of China's steel and iron sector was analyzed by Xiong and Sun et al. [15 ]. The policy impact of electricity substitution on China's green economic development was studied by Gao and Yuan et al., [35 ]. The modern sports business got its start in the West. The political and industrialization product, urbanization, technological growth, population growth, and entrepreneurial development of the previous two world wars have all contributed to the success of the American sports industry. Analyzed the connection between economic input and the growth of the sports sector using an input-output model. Akadiri and Adebayo et al. [7 ] suggested that the efficiency of the sports industry was affected by elements such as the level of development of the service industry, the level of urbanization, the level of financial development, and the climate environment. Business performance is positively impacted by technical R&D people, total asset turnover, and equity concentration, according to Khan et al. [36 ]; negatively impacted by development scale and time to market. Leisure time, income, culture, consumption ideology, way of life, sports product quality, publicity, and other variables all have an impact on the sports industry's effectiveness from the consumer's point of view. From the point of view of industrial ecosystem efficiency, the Shandong Peninsula sports industry environment is affected by societal ecology, natural ecology, and economic ecology factors such as natural resource foundations, location circumstances, development of infrastructure, and citizens' fitness understanding, financial status, strategies and policies, and other factors, as proposed by Huang et al. [37 ]. Consumption, the industrial climate, and government all play a role in whether or not the sports industry in Shandong is competitive, according to Srivastava et al. [10 ]. Using the Solow growth function and the super-efficiency SBM model, Yu et al. [38 ] evaluated the factor contribution rate and industrial efficiency of the growth of the regional sports industry, and they investigated the impact of related factors via regression analysis. The Chinese sports sector is associated with economic growth, followed by per capita disposable income, and lowest of all with the number of employees, according to a grey correlation analysis performed by Jin et al. [39 ]. According to multiple linear regression models developed by Purnamawati [40 ], the competitiveness of China's sports sector is positively correlated with the country's economic growth. Chinese academics have had a lengthy and lively discussion on the sports industry's precise meaning, which can be broken down into four broad categories. The first view is that sports are a tertiary industry because they rely on live labor to produce goods and services [41 ]. The alternative theory proposes that anything created or sold in connection with sports should be considered part of the sports industry. The manufacturing and distribution of sports goods and services are therefore included in the sports business. In China, this viewpoint predominates. This definition was used to categorize the 2015 and 2019 National Sports Industry Statistical Classification versions. The third and fourth perspectives classify the sports business as part of the sports sector. The former group held that the sports sector would come to characterize the era of sports during China's economic reform [42–46 ]. The latter group, however, held that the sports business itself was the most lucrative aspect of the sporting world. Taking economic theory as its premise, the fourth type of view holds that the sports industry is the area of sports that can enter the market and make a profit, while the sports cause is the area that must depend on government support. Examining the economic impact of international athletics; comparing it to the study of the same topic for the American economy. The United States is a leading global player in the growth of the athletics business. It has a highly developed sports sector. Sports is one of the three industries comprising the United States economy, accounting for a disproportionate share of the country's overall value. The worth of production has been third in the country. The average capital interest rate in the sports sector is now over 80%, making it only slightly lower than commercial banks and the securities market [47–51 ]. U.S. GDP has benefited greatly from the highly developed sports sector. The sports industry hit an all-time high and unprecedented size in the 1990s. The sports sector contributed significantly to the U.S. economy, ranking eleventh in total output value at US$1.523 billion. The sporting products sector plays a significant role in the US sports market. The international sporting products market exploded in the 1970s. The American sporting goods business owes a great deal to the innovations of Nike and Reebok. They've been crucial to the overall athletics industry's expansion and development. Examining the economic impact of Britain's sports sector and what it means for the country. As a result of the Industrial Revolution, Britain rose to the position of an economic superpower. The British sports business's infrastructure and the sports market's maturation are both advanced. Although the sports business in the UK has grown steadily since the 1960s, its beginnings are obscure [52 ]. According to the available data, the value of sports production has surpassed that of the auto and tobacco sectors. Meanwhile, the sports business sector has been instrumental in helping to bring the unemployment rate down and ultimately lead to complete employment. The Economic Impact of France's Sporting Industry: A Contribution and Importance Analysis. According to the data available, there are approximately 6000 professional athletes in France, 200,000 sports organizations, and 15.5 million registered members. The French sports business relies heavily on the health and entertainment sector. France has a high degree of mass sports consumption compared to other countries because more than two-thirds of the population is involved in sports. Examination of the Sports Industry in Japan and Its Economic Impact [53 ]. The Japanese sports market can be broken down into four categories: sports products, sports services, sports information, and sports activity area. Japan is committed to developing the sports industry and adapting to societal requirements by conducting market research, creating innovative products, retaining and growing customer bases, setting realistic financial goals, and calculating reproduction rates. Work flexibility has been embraced and encouraged by the Japanese government in order to accomplish long-term decentralization, guarantee time for sports activities, and address problems like competition with public sports facilities. Japan's government has provided incentives to the sports industry, and as a result, the country now has a thriving recreational sports sector. The sports sector dominates the recreation sector, making up 8.3%. Examining the sports industry's economic impact in China, the sports sector has effectively boosted the growth of supporting businesses [54 ]. There are strong ties between the athletics business and other sectors of the economy. To begin, the sports market can potentially increase spending on customer preferences. For another, businesses can benefit from the sports industry's ability to increase their cohesiveness, rivalry, and centripetal force. In conclusion, the sports industry has a greater effect on the economy than any industry alone. The input-output model predicts that the sports sector will generate about 80.818 billion yuan across multiple regions in China, including Liaoning, Shanghai, Beijing, Guangdong, and others. China's economic and social growth has been shown to benefit greatly from the country's thriving sports sector [55 ]. To foster rapid economic development and emerge as a new economic growth center is advantageous. The sports business helps the country's revenue expand. As a new and growing sector of the Chinese economy, the sports business has risen to prominence in recent years. In some regions, the sports sector's growth rate has far outpaced the GDP growth rate. Some examples of these regions include Beijing (4.3%), Zhejiang (2.1%), Guangdong (3.2%), Liaoning (1.8%), and others.  3 Data and methodology 3.1 Data This present study attempts to investigate the role of the sports industry on carbon emissions using the dataset from 1990 to 2020 for China.  Carbon emission, economic development, technological development, sports industry, energy use, and social globalization are represented by the variables CO2, GDPC, TD, SI, ENE, and SG. The CO2 emissions are measured in kilotons, and CO2 emission represents the dependent variable in the study. The data source is the Chinese statistical yearbook. Economic development (GDP per capita growth annual %) data is taken from the Chinese statistical yearbook, while technology development (patent application (R&D)) from the Chinese statistical yearbook, the index measures social globalization, and data is taken from the KOF index. Energy consumption is estimated as % of total final energy consumption. The data source is World Bank represents the independent variables. Lastly, the sports industry is measured, and data is taken from SMEDA (See Table 1  ).  3.2 Model specification This study will focus on the following models,(1) C O 2 = f  ( β 0 ,    G D P C  β 1   , T D ,   β 2   S G ,   β 3   E N E ,   β 4   S I )   β 5        CO2, GDPC, TD, SG, ENE and SI refer to carbon emission, gross domestic product per capita, technological development, social globalization, energy consumption and the sports industry. As a result, here is the observational model that needs to be estimated:(2) C O 2 i , t   = β 0  + β 1   G D P C  i , t   + β 2   T D  i , t   + β 3   S G  i , t   + β 4   E N E  i , t   , β 5   S I  i , t   + ε i , t       where i stands for economics and t for year; εit is the error term, which follows a normal distribution with zero mean and small variation. We can convert the provided function into a log-log model by taking the natural log of it: In equation (3) , LCO2, LGDPC, LTD, LSG, LENE, and LSI refer to the natural log of carbon emission, GDP per capita, technological development, social globalization, energy consumption, and sports industry. Regression analysis served as the foundation for this investigation;(3) L C O 2 i , t   = β 0  + β 1   L G D P C  i , t   + β 2   L T D  i , t   + β 3   L S G  i , t   + β 4   L E N E  i , t   , β 5   L S I  i , t   + ε i , t        This study shows the long-run CO2, GDPC, TD, SG, ENE and SI elasticities, respectively. We expect a positive association between GDP per capita and carbon emission, i.e., (β1  = β C O 2  β G D P C      > 0). Sun et al. [52 ], believe that environmental quality is affected by economic development in three ways. The scale effect describes how economic development and increased economic activity lead to increased pollution and industrial waste due to economic growth. The coefficient of TD < 0 implies that the well-established technological development decreases carbon emission (β2  = β C O 2  β T D   < 0  )  . As an outcome of social globalization, countries can better invest in environmentally friendly production processes and technologies, and more money is directed toward these types of endeavors. This study envisages a negative influence of social globalization on carbon emission (β3  = β C O 2  β S G   < 0  )  . The energy consumption coefficient is positively associated with carbon emission (β4  = β L C O 2  β E N E   > 0  )  . Lastly, we envisage a positive association between the sports industry and carbon emission, i.e., (β5  = β L C O 2  β S I      > 0).  3.3 Methodology strategy 3.3.1 Unit root test In practical economics, several unit root tests are available for determining whether or not the variables are stationary, including the Phillips-Perron (P–P) test, the Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, the Kwiatkowski-Pearson Stationarity Test (KPSS), the Dickey-Fuller Distributed-Factor Generalized Linear Model (DF-GLS), the Elliot-Fuller Distributed-Factor Generalized Line. Lacking knowledge of where structural breakpoints appear in the series, these tests produce skewed and erroneous results. The stationarity of the data set in the existence of a structural break point was investigated using three models developed by Ref. [56 ]. This model (i) allows for a one-time modification of the level form of the variables, (ii) allows for a one-time modification of the slope of the trend component, that is function, and (iii) allows for a one-time modification of the intercept of the parameters to be used for empirical reasons. The following three models were used by Zhang et al. [57 ] to evaluate their hypothesis of just one structural break in the series:(4) Δ x t  = a + a x t − 1   + b t + c D U t  + ∑ j = 1  k  d j   Δ x t − j   + μ t      (5) Δ x t  = b + b x t − 1   + c t + b D T t  + ∑ j = 1  k  d j   Δ x t − j   + μ t      (6) Δ x t  = c + c x t − 1   + c t + d D U t  + d D T t  + ∑ j = 1  k  d j   Δ x t − j   + μ t       At each time-split observation point, the dummy variable DUt  indicates a mean shift, while DTt represents the directional trend in shift variables. So:(7) D U t  = { 1 . . . i f t > T B    0 . . . i f t < T B      a n d D U t  = { t − T B . . . i f t > T B    0 . . . i f t < T B           Without knowledge about the structural breakpoint, the null hypothesis for the unit-roots break date, c = 0, suggests that the series is not trend stationary with a drift, whereas the c < 0 hypothesis indicates that the variable is trend stationary with one unidentified time break. The Zivot-Andrews unit root test treats every data point as a candidate for a time split and then estimates the data by performing a regression at each split point. The time interval with the smallest one-sided t-statistic is chosen as the unit root and c ˆ  ( = c − 1  )  = 1   . is tested. Zivot-Andrews implies that the asymptotic distribution of the statistics diverges to infinite when endpoints are present. The beginning and ending points of the sample time must be avoided, so a suitable region must be selected. The Zivot-Andrews trimming areas are also recommended (0.15 T, 0.85 T).  3.3.2 ARDL bounds testing It is well known that macroeconomic variables are tested with cointegration procedures to see if they have converged in the long run due to their inherent drift character. Therefore, this research used the ARDL bounds test for cointegration, created by Pesaran et al. [58 ]. This technique was selected because it has gained widespread acceptance as being superior, advantageous, and flexible in comparison to more conventional approaches, which require that all variables be in the same order of integration (I(1), I(0), or both). The method's primary application is calculating the functional model's long-run equilibrium state of the relevant factors. Here is the solution written out (Eq.(8) Δ Z = ε 0  + ε 1  t + λ 1  δ t − 1   + ∑ i − 1  k  φ 1   ν i t − 1   + ∑ j − 1  n  φ j   Δ Z t − j   + ∑ i − 1  k  ∑ j − 1  n  ω i j     Δ V i t − j   + Υ D t  + μ t      (9) H 0  : φ 1  = φ 2  = … . = φ n + 2   = 0    H 1  : φ 1  ≠ φ 2  ≠ … . ≠ φ n + 2   ≠ 0         in cases where it is shown that the series has converged in the long run to correct any original short-run disturbance, we say that H0 has been rejected. When all variables are I (0), the AARDL model (augmented ARDL model) provides lower bounds known as I (0) critical values, and when all variables are I (1), it provides higher bounds known as I (1) critical values. (1). (1). It follows that the test statistic must exceed the upper critical value in order to reject the null hypothesis while falling below either of the lower bounds means that the null hypothesis cannot be denied. Importantly, the test is inconclusive if the statistic being tested lies anywhere in the middle of the allowed range, so they used a bootstrapping method to determine new crucial values. On the other hand, the hidden cointegration idea has risen to prominence in time series analysis since the work of Maddala and Wu [59 ]. To paraphrase Ozturk et al. [60 ], cointegration exists between two variables if their responses to the same shocks are identical. Udemba et al. [61 ] demonstrated that certain series could travel composed only in a positive shock but not with negative ones. They proposed a novel method in which the threshold is set to zero, yielding positive and negative sums. Decomposing the positive and negative changes in the sports sector (SP) as follows allows us to examine the asymmetric effects of uncertainty on CO2 emissions:(10) Δ l n C O  2 , t   = φ 1  + β 1  C O  2 , t − 1   + β 2  G D P C  t − 1   + β 3  T D  t − 1   + β 4  S G  t − 1   + β 5  E N E  t − 1   + β 6  S I  t − 1  +  + ∑ i = 1  p  γ 1 i   Δ C O  2 , t − i   + ∑ i = 0  p  γ 2 i   Δ G D P C  t − i   + ∑ i = 0  p  γ 3 i   Δ T D + ∑ i = 0  p  γ 4 i   Δ S G  t − i   + ∑ i = 0  p  γ 5 i    Δ E N E  t − i   + ∑ i = 0  p  γ 6 i    Δ S I  t − i  +  + ε t       Wang et al. [62 ] suggest a null hypothesis H0:β1 = β2 = β3 = β4 = β5 = β6 = β7 = 0 using critical values from Chudik and Pesaran [63 ] based on standard bounds tests, which allows for the verification of the cointegration nexus. In addition, we can conduct a normal Wald test on the asymmetric behavior over the long and short period by setting (β6/−β1 = β7/−β1) and (∑ i = 0  p − 1   γ 6 i    = ∑ i = 0  p − 1   γ 7 i     )  ), respectively. In addition, the augmented NARDL model can be tested in accordance with the three hypotheses in keeping with the work of Rahman [64 ] on the ARDL model, confirming the long-term association between the variables. In addition, the NARDL framework has been extended by Yameogo et al. [65 ] with the MTNARDL model, which features numerous thresholds rather than a single threshold. With this method, we can calculate the effect of both small and significant changes in the independent variable on the dependent one. To obtain partial sum series in the 25th, 50th, and 75th quintiles, we will apply an MTNARDL approach with three thresholds (τ25, τ50, and τ75) in this article.(11) S I  t i  = S I  0 i  + S I  t i  ( ω 1  )  + S I  t i  ( ω 2  )  + S I  t i  ( ω 3  )  + S I  t i  ( ω 4  )      (12) S I  t i  ( ω 1  )  = ∑ j = 1  t  Δ S I  j i    ( ω 1  )  = ∑ j = 1  t  Δ S I  j i  I   { Δ S I  j i  < τ 25   }      (13) S I  t i  ( ω 2  )  = ∑ j = 1  t  Δ S I  j i    ( ω 2  )  = ∑ j = 1  t  Δ S I  j i  I   { τ 25  < Δ Q j i  < τ 50   }      (14) S I  t i  ( ω 3  )  = ∑ j = 1  t  Δ S I  j i    ( ω 3  )  = ∑ j = 1  t  Δ S I  j i  I   { τ 50  < Δ Q j i  < τ 75   }      (15) S I  t i  ( ω 4  )  = ∑ j = 1  t  Δ S I  j i    ( ω 4  )  = ∑ j = 1  t  Δ S I  j i  I   { τ 75  ≤ Δ Q j i   }      where I{T}is a boolean indicator function that returns one if condition T holds and zero otherwise. Our MTNARDL model will therefore consist of the following:(16) Δ l n C O  2 , t   = φ 1  + β 1  C O  2 , t − 1   + β 2  G D P C  t − 1   + β 3  T D  t − 1   + β 4  S G  t − 1   + β 5  E N E  t − 1   + ∑ l = 1  4  β k   S I  t − 1  i  ( ω l  )  + ∑ i = 1  p  γ 1 i   Δ C O  2 , t − i   + ∑ i = 0  p  γ 2 i   Δ G D P C  t − i   + ∑ i = 0  p  γ 3 i    Δ T D  t − i   + ∑ i = 0  p  γ 4 i   Δ S G  t − i   + ∑ i = 0  p  γ 5 i    Δ E N E  t − i   + ∑ l = 1  4  ∑ i = 0  p  γ k i     S I  t − i  i  ( ω l  )  + ε t      in which H0:β1 = β2 = β3 = β4 = β5 = β6 = β7 = β8 = β9 = β10 = 0 serves as the starting point for hypothesis testing. to which the critical values proposed by Onishi [66 ] serve as a standard measure. Although the paper makes clear, there are no critical values for more than six independent variables.    4 Results and discussion In order to establish whether or not the variables of interest are stationary, we first conduct stationarity tests using the well-established ADF, PP, and Zivot-Andrew unit root tests, presented here. The researchers in this study even went so far as to plot a graph of the variables to understand the underlying patterns better. Here we also show a summary statistical test and a correlation coefficient matrix. 4.1 Descriptive statistics and correlation matrix Table 2   displays the findings of the standard test of descriptive statistics and the correlation matrix we calculated before discussing the study's regular results. Carbon dioxide emissions can go as high as 8768 and as low as 3153. In the case of GDP growth, the mean is 8.377, and the maximum percentage is 9.054. TD (TD) has a mean of 17.478, a standard deviation of 2.657, an ultimate value of 19.434, and a minimum value of 16.984. The descriptive statistics of other variables like social globalization, energy use, and the sports industry are also presented in Table 2 . Technological development has the highest mean value, and social globalization has a lower value. The chart below discusses the results of the correlation matrix. The increase in GDP is inversely proportional to CO2 emissions. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and energy consumption, CO2 emissions and social interconnectedness (SI), and TD all have a negative association with the globalization of society. Aside from these, there is a favorable relationship between all other variables.The correlation matrix results are given in Table 3  .  4.2 Unit root test Before diving deeper into a time series, it's important to determine the integration sequence. Table 4   displays the ADF and PP unit root test results. Based on the results, we can safely assume that all factors are initially stationary. In addition, it is commonly acknowledged that conventional unit-root analyses are biased toward rejecting the unit-root null hypothesis. Despite the widespread use of unit-root tests to identify indicators' stationarity properties, this article does not employ them due to claims by Wasim that they lead to biased and ambiguous results if there is evidence of structural break(s) in the variables. As a result, we used a test for unit roots, which identifies a discrete point of discontinuity in a sequence. Based on this, the article used the Zivot-Andrew unit root test to identify the stationarity features of the series. The unit root test outcomes are shown in Table 4 . The factors show that social globalization is level- and first-difference-stationary.  4.3 ARDL bound test The cointegration limits test is shown in Table 5  . The F-test of the employed model was found to be 10.658 based on the results of the ARDL limits test. At the 1% significance level, our model's estimate surpassed the upper bound, indicating t significant long-term association between economic growth, technological progress, social globalization, energy consumption, the sports industry, and CO2 emissions. The significant impact identified in this study, is comparable to the findings of [67–70 ].  4.4 Augmented ARDL Instead of the classic ARDL model suggested by Rafique et al. [71 ], we employ the updated version presented by Cao et al. [72 ]. Table 6   displays the results, demonstrating that the three null hypotheses of no cointegration are rejected at the 1% significance level. In addition, the outcomes showed that all ECT are significant at the 1% level, with negative coefficients showing a long-run adjustment in all models. Therefore, China re-adjusts over 48% of deviations from long-run equilibrium each year. However, the ECT coefficient shows that the adjustment rate in this instance is extremely rapid, at over 80% per year, compared to Morocco and Egypt. Akram et al. [73 ] state that a value of the ECT coefficient between 1 and 2 indicates muted fluctuations along the equilibrium route; however, the value of the ECT coefficient in Turkey is 1.058, which is less than 1. Rather than assuming a constant convergence to the equilibrium route, we propose interpreting the coefficient (1.058) as indicating that the ECT exhibits dampened variation around the long-run value. However, once this process concludes, conjunction to the equilibrium route occurs rapidly. In addition, diagnostic tests showed that the estimators are steady over time, there is no autocorrelation of errors, the R-squared is high, and there is no auto-regressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) behavior. CO2 emissions are positively associated with GDP per individual. These results agree with those of prior research [74 ]. However, the results showed that the sports industry has a positive effect on carbon emissions in China, while technical progress and social globalization have a negative impact. In addition, the energy coefficient positively affects CO2 emissions, which indicates that CO2 emissions increase as energy usage rises.  4.5 Augmented NARDL model estimation results Going back to the work of Rehman et al. [75 ], we can see that the idea of hidden cointegration has been widely discussed in the economics literature up until the paper by Ning et al. [76 ], in which they apply the Granger and Yoon approach to the ARDL equation by separating the independent variable into its positive and negative fractional sums. We also use the enhanced NARDL model to test the three hypotheses, which helps corroborate the long-term associations between the variables. Results from the modified NARDL computation are shown in Table 6 , and their main points are summarised as follows. We found that the null hypothesis is that negative and positive changes do not co-integrate with other variables. Furthermore, the Wald test for asymmetric behavior rejects the symmetric effect of SI on CO2 emissions only in India, demonstrating that SI affects CO2 emissions asymmetrically and solely the positive changes, both in the short- and long-term. A 1% drop in SI would have a similar effect on China's CO2 emissions in the long term.  4.6 MTNARDL model estimation results Critical post-estimation tests, such as the serial correlation (Bresuch-Godfrey) test, specification error (Ramsey-RESET) test, heteroscedasticity (Breusch-Pegan-Godfrey) test, and stability test based on Cumulative Sum and Cumulative Sum of Square (CUSUM and CUSUMSQ) charts, follow the MTNARDL results. The stability graphs (CUSUM and CUSUMSQ) are shown above the lower panel of Table 7  , while the pertinent post-estimation diagnoses are summarised below it. Results from a multinomial threshold NARDL (MTNARDL) analysis are shown in Table 8  . We used the ARDL model with multiple thresholds proposed by Danish and Wang [77 ] to achieve more robust results in the sports industry by dividing it into four partial sums based on three thresholds at the 25, 50, and 75% quintiles. This decomposition allows us to identify the effect of small and large SI shifts on CO2 emissions. The results demonstrate a cointegration association between the partial sums of SI and other variables in the complete sample of China. As a result, technological development and social globalization have a negative impact on carbon emission (CO2), while per capita income, energy consumption, and the sports industry have a positive impact on carbon emission (CO2). The research moves forward on the basis of the results of the cointegration tests and the correction of all the necessary preconditions of the MTNARDL method. It assesses how CO2 in China will evolve in light of recent advances in ecological regulator technology and other factors that influence environmental health. Table 7  displays the estimated MTNARDL standard.  4.7 Discussions The data show that rising prosperity helps reduce carbon emissions (CO2). Empirical results investigating the statistically significant and positive impact of economic growth on CO2 emissions in the context of economic growth in China economies are consistent with the earlier literature of Guo et al. [78 ]. However, China's correlation between GDP per capita and CO2 emissions is inverse. The China region has been expanding at a steady pace without worrying about the impact on the environment, and their GDP growth rates have increased in recent decades. This suggests a positive correlation between carbon emissions and economic growth. In addition, as real incomes rose, more money was spent on discretionary items, many of which are powered by fossil fuels. The biggest of the China economy also happens to be the most populous. The general public is not well-informed about environmental issues, and as a result, they expect cleaner air and less stringent enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. Changes in structure and increased consciousness have a multiplicative effect on reducing environmental deterioration. If economic growth in the target China nation reaches a certain threshold, it will inevitably lead to improvements in environmental quality. To be more exact, the marginal impact of economic growth on CO2 emissions is positive at the outset but then begins to decline and becomes negative as the economy matures. This result lends credence to the possibility that the EKC theory holds for the BRICS nations. Cheng et al. [79 ] found the same thing for Malaysia; Peng et al. [80 ] found the same thing for recently industrialized countries; and Manzoor et al. [81 ] found the same thing for low-, middle-, and high-income countries and the aggregated panel. In contrast, the results of Erdoğan et al. [82 ] for Cambodia, Facchini and Seghezza [83 ] for nations in Sub-Saharan Africa, and Safi et al. [84 ] for OBORI countries do not agree with ours. The EKC hypothesis may exist because these economies improve environmental quality by decreasing the amount of polluted products used in activities requiring electricity. Also, it has been demonstrated in a model that a positive (negative) variation in technological innovation reduces (increases) CO2 emissions in China. This indicates that technical advancement helps reduce environmental damage in China. As a result, eco-innovation is closely linked to technical innovation in China. Thus, this research considers technical progress across entire properties, wherein some patents generate extremely high pollution levels, and others generate very low levels. The outcomes of technological progress show that increased air pollution results from our excessive reliance on patents unrelated to environmental protection. However, these nations play a more central role in technological innovation and abuse these innovations for political gain. China is consistently ranked among the world's most innovative. This result should come as no surprise. One possible explanation for the unintended consequences of technological progress is that they are being used in conjunction with environmentally protective technologies, inventions, or ideas. The development and implementation of technology to reduce carbon pollution have increased as attention to climate change has grown. These strategies can be seen in developing technologies such as energy storage, green building ideas, carbon fixation, carbon capture, combined heat and power generation, and green chemistry. Both theory and practice support the ameliorating impacts of these methods. Therefore, policymakers in China must give environmentally friendly innovations high precedence. Multiple studies have confirmed this result by demonstrating that TI aids in reducing environmental deterioration. There is evidence from other research to suggest that a rise in TI is the cause of environmental deterioration. Between 1999 and 2021, the correlation between social globalization and CO2 emissions in China is statistically significant and negative. The data show that a 1% rise in social globalization has a positive effect on the environment by decreasing carbon dioxide emissions. Our findings are consistent with Safi et al. [84 ]. The findings of this research indicate that the effects of social globalization present favorable conditions under which emissions can be reduced in China. Life has altered as a result of the growth of societal qualities that have broadened the appeal of patriotism and nationalism. The results of this research demonstrate that countries in the BRICS group are in a position to reduce their CO2 emissions as a result of the effects of social globalization. The results show that the coefficients of energy consumption are positive and statistically significant at the 1% level, suggesting that a one-tenth of a percentage point rise in energy consumption is associated with a corresponding rise in carbon emissions. Fixed effects and unrelated regression confirmed the empirical conclusion that energy consumption increases carbon emissions. Overall, the results showed that increased primary energy use led to a decline in environmental quality by hastening environmental degradation. This is likely because many developing nations are wholly or partially reliant on this form of energy or rely on inefficient technologies that generate high carbon emissions. Balsalobre-Lorente et al. [85 ] from the global perspective, Athari et al. [86 ] for various regions and the global panel, and Adeleye et al. [87 ] in low, middle, and high-income countries all found similar results. In order to guarantee the efficient use of energy resources in their states, reduce energy consumption, speed up economic growth, and cause as little harm to the environment as possible, this study recommends that the governments of all countries adopt energy conservation policies. Growing the usage of clean technology or increasing the use of renewable energy sources can help accomplish these objectives. In the meantime, the findings show that a rise of just 1% in using green energy sources can lower carbon emissions. As renewable energy technology is long-lasting and widely available, increasing its use significantly lowers environmental degradation. The use of renewable energy sources reduces environmental degradation, and nations can accelerate the adoption of these sources. The use of green energy sources is growing, which not only helps meet industrialization's energy needs and reducing pollution. The outcomes of this study are consistent with those of recent research [4 ,88 ]. Similarly, this research finds that engaging in sports has a beneficial effect on emissions. Our preliminary model findings indicate that sports tourism associated with March Madness in 2019 caused in a total carbon footprint of just under 210 million kg CO2eq. The outcomes indicate that attendance and travel distance contribute significantly to the total quantity of GHGs emitted, regardless of the host city, the teams competing, or the emissions industry. The greater the number of people who travel long distances to join these games, the more greenhouse gases are produced. Several indicators point in this direction: tourism and group travel accounted for about 80% of the entire carbon footprint, making them the largest contributors to the total emissions industry. Since the transportation of tourists to their destinations accounts for the bulk of the industry's carbon footprint, our results are coherent with those of other studies that factor in motorized transport. On the other hand, the sports industry has a negative impact on carbon emissions in China. The results indicate that the sports industry will increase a country's income. The sports industry will focus on the bad effects that can mitigate carbon emissions. Due to environmental sustainability, the foreign country will like to tour the host country for sports events.   5 Conclusion and policy suggestions After the 2008 financial crisis, which caused widespread uncertainty and mistrust in the international economy and had far-reaching negative consequences for the global economy over a number of years, the idea of a sports industry gained traction among academics and policymakers. Carbon emissions (as measured by carbon dioxide emissions; CO2) in China from 1990 to 2020 were analyzed in this paper. The study contrasted using the latest ARDL procedure to handle any potential effects. In order to circumvent problems with the dependent variable being a number in order 0, we first employed the augmented ARDL model proposed by Anser et al. [89 ]. To address the impact of positive and negative shifts in WUI on carbon emissions, we implemented the NARDL model proposed by J. Zhao et al. [09]. Finally, to analyze the impact of minor and large SI shifts on CO2 emissions, we used the MTNARDL model proposed by Lazăr et al. [90 ]. The outcomes revealed that economic development, energy use, and the sports industry have a positive impact on carbon emissions, while technological development and social globalization have a negative impact on carbon emissions (CO2). This paper's empirical results have important policy implications for China's economies regarding environmental quality and long-term economic growth. Until the Kuznets curve reaches its inflection point, the China region cannot rely on economic development to slow down pollution. To maintain long-term economic growth and reduce environmental degradation, it is suggested that the Chinese economy invest in energy efficiency initiatives and switch to cleaner energy sources. For this reason, China needs to promote the use of nuclear, solar, and wind power in both domestic and industrial settings. It should encourage the efficient use of non-renewable resources to reduce carbon dioxide pollution caused by power generation. It should also reduce the CO2 emissions connected with the executive green environment policy to clean up the environment. Therefore, China's economy should adopt a coherent plan to strike a fair and sustainable equilibrium between economic growth and environmental degradation. Finally, China should reevaluate its energy subsidy policies and increase environmental regulations, focusing particularly on the sectors that are major contributors to pollution. These regulations have the potential to lighten the load on the planet. The following results should encourage policymakers in the China region to increase spending on research and development. The commitment of China region to cleaner energy and lower emissions through increased renewable energy use could be responsible for this success. Therefore, the governments of the China region should support efforts to spread energy-saving technologies. One of the moderating impacts of technology is a decrease in the energy intensity of human activities. As a result, the government should promote and encourage this type of technology utilization. Policymakers in these nations should examine and lessen the negative effects of economic globalization on the environment, as suggested by our results. They must enforce stringent environmental regulations on businesses at home and abroad to encourage greener manufacturing methods. The governments of these nations, in particular, need to push their exporting businesses towards more energy efficiency and green power. Some projects should be organized to raise the environmental consciousness of newcomers to the nation as an extension of the social globalization process. However, social globalization has little to no effect on the environment. Tourism businesses and tourist accommodations should also be incentivized to expand their use of renewable energy sources. Finally, given the discovery that political globalization lessens environmental pollution, governments must sign more agreements to lessen environmental pollution and maintain stringent measures for the goals in these agreements. This study found that feedback effects occur with regard to carbon emissions and energy consumption, and it outlines the following policy implications based on these findings. The findings of this research support the call for policymakers to prioritize energy conservation initiatives that maximize the productive use of energy resources. Using fossil fuels also has a positive effect on economic development and pollution levels. In addition, we advocate for using green energy in all nations as a means to increase growth, reduce carbon emission, and lowering fossil fuel consumption). The analysis demonstrates that financial development supports the promoting effects, indicating that governments should emphasize the constraining effect of finance; for example, the financial institutions should encourage clean technology or offer loans to high-tech companies to enhance energy efficiency. Recognizing the shared responsibility of all stakeholders in the sports industry with an interest in tackling climate change, the results have consequences for sports managers, sports participants, policymakers, and academics. They improve our knowledge of the total emissions produced by sports participation and the reasons for such participation that result in the greatest or least significant increases in emissions. This insight is useful for sports administrators because it demonstrates the need to consider both the environmental and participatory outcomes of sporting activities. In particular, understanding which sports produce the most and least carbon emissions is crucial for setting goals and developing strategies for environmental sustainability. Participation in organized sport, in particular, is linked to greater emission levels, as evidenced by the positive effects of club membership and performance level. This means that league games and an official tournament and competition schedulers for athletes and clubs in the region of the association should reevaluate travel distances and transportation means to see if more eco-friendly options are available. League games, formal competitions, and tournaments could be held in areas where many teams and athletes are based on cutting down on travel and the resulting emissions. Similarly, when planning official training camps or courses, sports administrators at all levels of sport should reconsider travel locations and related transportation means.
