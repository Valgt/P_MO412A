                  Using bibliometric techniques, we evaluate the contribution of current academic research to the advancement of sustainable development agenda as expressed in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets . We focus on four knowledge domains highly relevant to the ethos of sustainable development, each with a distinct approach, to finding a balance between ecological and economic systems when it comes to development: “Circular Economy” (CE), “Degrowth” (DG), Green Growth” (GG), and research specifically addressing sustainable development goals that we refer to as “SDG Research” (SDGR). We evaluate two dimensions: scope – the extent to which the full range of UN Sustainable Develpment (SD) Agenda 2030 topics expressed in targets and indicators for each SDG are explored; and intensity- the quantity of research focusing on each SDG. Our analysis demonstrates that the four knowledge domains examined: CE, DG, GG and the emerging domain labelled SDGR, have made important contributions to research related with the 17 UN SDGs. However, these contributions are heterogeneous with important differences according to the SDGs. We find that academic research does not fully align with the policy agenda, identifying several gaps. The disparate coverage of SDGs priorities by academics may compromise the progress and implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Agenda 2030.

Department of Business and Economics University of Almería La Cañada de San Urbano Almería 04120 Spain       Using bibliometric techniques, we evaluate the contribution of current academic research to the advancement of sustainable development agenda as expressed in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets . We focus on four knowledge domains highly relevant to the ethos of sustainable development, each with a distinct approach, to finding a balance between ecological and economic systems when it comes to development: “Circular Economy” (CE), “Degrowth” (DG), Green Growth” (GG), and research specifically addressing sustainable development goals that we refer to as “SDG Research” (SDGR). We evaluate two dimensions: scope – the extent to which the full range of UN Sustainable Develpment (SD) Agenda 2030 topics expressed in targets and indicators for each SDG are explored; and intensity- the quantity of research focusing on each SDG. Our analysis demonstrates that the four knowledge domains examined: CE, DG, GG and the emerging domain labelled SDGR, have made important contributions to research related with the 17 UN SDGs. However, these contributions are heterogeneous with important differences according to the SDGs. We find that academic research does not fully align with the policy agenda, identifying several gaps. The disparate coverage of SDGs priorities by academics may compromise the progress and implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Agenda 2030.   Keywords Sustainable development goals  Circular Economy  Degrowth  Green Growth  Sustainability  Bibliometric analysis    1 Introduction On 25 September 2015, The United Nations (UN) General Assembly approved the Resolution A/RES/70/1 on “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”. The agenda was agreed upon by all the 193 members of the UN (UN, 2015 ; Costanza et al., 2016 ) and outlined 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that aim to resolve economic, social, and environmental issues hindering global progress towards sustainable development (Gue et al., 2020 ; Niestroy, 2016 ; Ramirez et al., 2019 ). Rather than targeting only developing countries -as it was the case with the preceding UN Millennium Development Goals- the 2030 Agenda also demands actions within developed economies. “All countries and all stakeholders, acting in collaborative partnership, will implement this plan. (UN, 2015 , p. 1). As a universal agenda, adopted unanimously, the 17 SDGs with its 169 targets and 213 measurable indicators, (which can be modified among different countries, regions or local authorities), form a global plan of action for people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership and set objectives that surpass previously partial approaches to sustainable development (Nerini, et al., 2018 ; Jones et al., 2018 ; Kolk and Kourula, 2017 ; UN, 2015 ). Now, the SDGs are a recognized blueprint for global development until 2030 used by business, industry, governmental, non-governmental and regional organizations (Hametner and Kostetckaia, 2020 ). However, there are important challenges to overcome in order to work towards these objectives, pointing out the importance of paying more attention to the interrelationships between sectors, between stakeholders and between countries with both greater and lesser degrees of economic development (Stafford-Smith et al., 2017 ). In addition, there are strong interdependencies between the goals and delay or failure -either total or partial- to implement one goal will have repercussions in the others (UN, 2017 ). This is a critical concern because as pointed out by Randers et al. (2018)  it is uncertain how the goals will be operationalized using conventional policy unable to deal with trade-offs between the goals. Because of the complexity of these interrelationships, scientific research has a critical role to play in the success of the SDG, for instance by drawing on existing knowledge or creating new knowledge to help “in the translation of the global goals into practical national and local levels agendas” (Salvia et al., 2019 , p. 843). Accordingly, there is a need to examine suitability and appropriateness of the existing thinking around environment and development that underpins industry and organizational practices. Thus, it is necessary to investigate whether the leading conceptual approaches to environment and development can benefit the achievement and implementation of the SDGs in the near future. In other words, which of the existing approaches to sustainable development (SD) can aid the implementation of SDGs and address the present grand challenges? From a plethora of conceptual approaches to sustainable development, three stand out as they directly discuss the interface between environment, development and society - these are Circular Economy (CE), Degrowth (DG) and Green Growth (GG). Yet, it is not fully understood to which extent these conceptual domains embrace the breadth of topics encompassed by the SDGs or whether the knowledge accumulated under these domains can be used to achieve the goals and targets set by SDGs (Millar et al., 2019 ). CE advocates for an economic system that dissociates environmental pressure from economic growth through the replacement of linear production for circular production where waste becomes a resource (Pla-Julián and Guevara, 2019 ; Skawińska and Zalewski, 2018 ; Sanguino et al., 2020 ). GG focuses on generation of economic growth through investments in activities that protect or restore the natural environment (Vazquez-Brust et al., 2014 ). DG assumes resource limitations and advocates smaller growth rates, even negative, to balance the natural and the economic systems (Jakob and Edenhofer, 2014 ; Sandberg et al., 2019 ; Van den Bergh et al., 2019 ). Degrowth is recognized as an alternative to the capitalist growth system (Schneider et al., 2010 ; Kallis, 2011 ; Demaria et al., 2013 ; Vandeventer et al., 2019 ). However, while CE and GG concepts are increasingly permeating policy agendas, DG ideas are often seen as controversial by political and economic decision-makers (Sandberg et al., 2019 ) and this controversial nature is damaging the potential that researchers have emphasised for DG as feasible alternative vision of the future (Vandeventer et al., 2019 ). A crucial question for the CE, DG and GG development is to what extent research conducted within these three domains can solve grand challenges presented by the SDGs. All three domains contribute to investigation of decoupling economic prosperity from resource use and emissions (Haberl et al., 2020 ) and this make their research potentially relevant to the implementation of UN SDGs. Although research in CC, DG and GG have similarities in certain aspects, there are important differences in focus that may have significant implications for their relevance to support progress in the achievement of SDGs. Thus, the aim of the paper is to identify the relevance of published research in CE, DG, GG with the targets of current global public policy on sustainable development as expressed by the UN SDGs (UN, 2015 ). Two dimensions are explored to fully appreciate the contribution of existing research for the implementation of UN SDGs: scope – the extent to which the full range of UN SD Agenda 2030 topics expressed in targets and indicators for each SDG are explored; and intensity- the quantity of research focusing on each SDG. We further compare the contribution of CE, DG and GG with the contribution of research specifically addressing sustainable development goals, a separate longstanding domain that we refer to as SDGR (SDG Research). Our analysis are carried out using bibliometric tools1  1 Bibliometric analyses minimize bias and potential error by locating existing studies, evaluating their contributions, analysing the data and reporting the evidence regarding a specific subject (Gorraiz and Gumpenberger, 2015 ). Comparing with qualitative analysis, bibliometric analysis allows handling a very high volume of papers related to the subject.   to locate existing studies and evaluate their contributions based on co-occurrence of the keywords (Keathley-Herring et al., 2016 ; Gutiérrez-Salcedo et al., 2018 ; Zavaraqi and Fadaie, 2012 ). Previous literature has proposed several models to identify and group academic contribution to the SDGs (Engelmann et al., 2019 ; UN, 2017 ; Wu et al., 2018 ). However, these models are conceptual and did not directly consider scientific production when grouping academic research under the SDGs. Our work aims to assess the relevance of academic research to the SDGs by relating the research in the conceptual domains of CE, DD, GG and SDGR to topics raised in individual SDGs, their targets and indicators. The paper is structured as follows. First, we revise academic literature concerning SDGR, CE, DG and GG. Further, we apply a bibliometric method combined with a keyword review of SDGs' targets and indicators in order to connect the SDGs with the conceptual domains of CE, DG, GG and SDGR. We present and discuss results that help visualize in quantitative and graphic terms the evolution of research and main topics of academic interest related to UN SDGs in each domain, thus outlining the current academic agenda related to sustainable development. Secondly, we identify the topics contained in the policy agenda as expressed in the goals, targets and indicators of the UN SDGs and we analyse the alignment of existing academic research with the policy agenda, evaluating the relevance of each domain through the scope and intensity of research in each SDG. We find that academic research does not fully align with the policy agenda, identifying several gaps. We also find that the academic agenda explores some topics not yet translated into the policy agenda. Finally, the paper presents conclusions, implications and suggestions for further research.  2 Origins of CE, GG and DG and their relevance to the UN SDGs 2.1 Circular economy and the UN SDGs Nowadays one of the most influential and pervasive concepts within sustainable development, CE is essentially a bricolage of ideas drawn from longstanding economic and environmental paradigms that suggest to increase the efficiency of resource use to reach improvements in the existing balance between economy, environment and society (Ghisellini et al., 2016 ; Giampietro, 2019 ; Murray et al., 2017 ). As noted by Korhonen et al. (2018) , CE roots are in ecological economics, and its central idea can be linked to the macroeconomic potential of cyclical material flows contained in Georgescu-Roegen's “Matter matters, too”, or the fourth law of thermodynamics. Kirchherr et al. (2018)  note that core concepts of CE had been discussed since the 1960s, and Sehnem et al. (2019)  argue that CE conceptual contribution overlaps with operational research in reverse logistics and it is nested in pre-existing theories of Industrial Symbiosis. However, the reality is that, the tensions between the ongoing use of natural resources and physical boundaries of circular flows (e.g., loss of material properties) are still standing (Sehnem et al., 2019 ). Moreover, CE theorization of how to address the challenge is weak, especially as it does not accept boundaries for the application of the concept. In addition, it is ambiguous about how to deal with industries that cannot be made circular. Giampietro (2019)  emphasises that the CE is presented as a model and strategy, rather than as a theoretical construct and its practical implications for sustainability are ambiguously defined. However, regardless of its theoretical limitations (see Korhonen et al., 2018 ), the CE is seen as one of the most promising avenues to steer the transitions needed to achieve the SDGs, essentially owing to its allure for policymakers and industrialists (Schroeder et al., 2019 ). However, several authors not only question the suitability of the concept to deal with the complexities and interdependencies of sustainable development but worry about potentially negative impacts on social inclusion and climate change (e.g., Sehnem et al., 2019 ). The debates question whether CE can evolve on its own to address its theoretical and policy limitations or should be complemented with approaches with a less ambiguous framing of growth. Although there is no explicit use of the term CE in the targets of SDGs, the connection between CE and SDG 12 is transparent in SDG 12.5 “By  2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse 2  2 https://indicators.report/targets/12-5/   ”. The UN SDGs website also includes information on CE as part of knowledge resources for SDG 12. The basic principles of the circular economy are based on the consumption reduction, reuse, recovery and recycling of materials and energy (Blomsma et al., 2017 ; Zwiers et al., 2020 ). In this sense, the CE is one of the keys to breaking the direct relationship between economic growth and consumption of natural resources (Oriekhova, 2019 ; Geisendorf and Pietrulla, 2017 ; Hazen et al., 2016 ). Recent papers focus on the relevance of CE to the SDGs. Schroeder et al. (2019)  explain these connections concluding that CE has the strongest relationships with SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG 15 (Life on Land). CE also offers potential to develop synergies between several SDGs, as it addresses important concepts mentioned in SDGs such as those promoting economic growth and jobs (SDG 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth), eliminating poverty (SDG 1 No Poverty), improving sustainable food production (SDG 2 Zero Hunger), and improving biodiversity protection in the oceans (SDG 14 Life Below Water) and on land (SDG 15 Life on Land).  2.2 Green growth and the UN SDGs The concept of Green Growth had been discussed since 1990 but gained traction in 2005 in South Korea, as a policy that emphasises environmentally sustainable economic progress to foster low-carbon, socially inclusive development. (Vazquez-Brust and Sarkis, 2012 ). GG interprets expenditure to prevent climate change not as a cost but as an investment and argues that economic crises are opportunities to dispose of obsolete polluting technologies and introduce radical changes towards sustainability; and advocates investment in the environment as a driver for “recoupling” environmental protection with growth accumulation (Haberl et al., 2020 ; Hickel and Kallis, 2020 ). GG supports the reframing of economic progress through a movement away from quantity and towards quality as well as away from the consumption of physical products and towards that of nonphysical outputs, and from technological towards wider socially embedded innovation (organisational innovation, social networks and R&D intensive specialisation) (Csaba, 2010 ). Practically, the necessity is argued to only  promote future economic activity not harmful to, and which can support, natural capital – sunrise industries- while gradually orchestrating the phasing out of harmful industries – sunset industries- and reconfiguration of their resources towards non environmentally harmful ends (Vazquez-Brust et al., 2014 ). There are many shades of Green Growth but the east-Asian version of the concept, with its explicit focus on a green state articulating socially inclusive environmental policies, is the one that has been championed by many developing economies – e.g., Brazil, South Africa and Malaysia - that see in it an economic perspective for sustainability that fits with the realities of politics and resource needs in low-and middle-income economies. Different to CE, which is an aspirational model, GG is a policy focus aiming to provide contingent practical prescriptions (Hamdouch and Depret, 2010 ). Both approaches share an eclectic and not fully articulated theoretical foundation. Green Growth literature tends to be concerned with ‘making growth processes resource-efficient’ and ‘stimulating demand for green technologies, goods, and services’ (Haberl et al., 2020 , p. 30). The OECD proposes GG as a policy pathway to the achievement of the UN SDGs. The linkages of GG with the SDGs are explicit in UN SDGs website where Green Growth is included as a key topic and concept3  3 The search within the UN SDG webpage using the term Green Growth produced 561 results. This included 83 publications and 8 events. The search tool also indicates that SDGs 8, 12 and 4 have been connected with the topic in these documents.   linked to resource efficiency. The UN SDGs knowledge platform includes 185 documents related to Green Growth..4  4 (https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?menu=1629&str=green+growth   Imasiku et al. (2019)  suggests that GG is mainly related to SDG 8 (Decent work and Economic Growth) through green innovation (target 8.2 and target 8.4). For instance, target 8.4 indicates “Improve progressively, through 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption and production and endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation”. Islam and Managi (2019)  propose that GG is related to all UN SDGs, but both Merino-Saum et al. (2018)  and Khoshnava et al. (2019)  consider GG ill-prepared to advance SDGs with more focus on social issues such as SDG 5 and SDG 10.  2.3 Degrowth and the UN SDGs Degrowth posits that economic growth should not be a precondition for increasing human well-being (Latouche, 2009 ; Victor, 2012 ; Demaria et al., 2013 ; Büchs and Koch, 2017 ). Garret Hardin's essay “The Tragedy of the Commons”(1968) and Meadows et al. (1972)  “The Limits of Growth” powerfully articulated the notion that continued economic growth is impossible given the limits of finite planet, thus should be stopped if the human race was to survive. The Degrowth perspective – also termed “survivalism” - imbued the work of ecological economics pioneer Herman Daly, who proposed a steady-state economy as alternative to growth, and dominated environmentalism until Sustainable Development took over in the 1990s (Dryzek, 1997 ). More recently, Vandeventer et al. (2019)  proposed the reconceptualization of Degrowth as a radical niche innovation to the capitalist-growth regime, proposing that degrowth “fundamentally seeks to undermine the hegemonic idea of equating a single measure – in the capitalist-growth regime this is growth – with well-being and a pleasurable existence. Degrowth rejects the notion that there is a singular, external measure of the ‘good life.’ More important to replacing the capitalist-growth regime is the continued deepening, connectivity and interdependence of relationships and practices within expanding networks of academics and practitioners”  (Vandeventer et al., 2019 , p. 284). Focusing on social issues, different works have discussed the potential contribution of the DG approach to sustainability (Demaria et al., 2013 ; Shrivastava, 2015 ; Jackson, 2009 ; Kallis, 2015 ; Plaza-Úbeda et al., 2020 ; Vandeventer et al., 2019 ; Haberl et al., 2020 ). Critics of DG, as a path to sustainability, argue that DG is too reductionist and a reduction in GDP does not necessarily mean a reduction in energy consumption or in the emission of pollutants (Robra and Heikkurinen, 2019 ; Haberl et al., 2020 ). Perhaps more important, DG presents an ontological contradiction with a foundational tenet of sustainable development, which is the notion of environmentally benign growth, where growth continues through decoupling from environmental deterioration (Haberl et al., 2020 ). The Brundtland report, for instance, infamously presented a vision of a future sustainable economy five to ten times larger than it was at the time (Daly et al., 1993 ). Degrowth challenges sustainable development by proposing an alternative vision where growth is not desirable and considering other areas that organizations must prioritize instead of the exclusively economic approach of the capitalist mode, such as social or environmental performance (Plaza-Úbeda et al., 2020 ). As could be expected given the divergence about the meaning of growth between DG and the dominant understanding of Sustainable Development, Degrowth is not mentioned in the UN SDGs website, neither as related topic nor as knowledge resource. Robra and Heikkurinen (2019)  point out assumptions included on SDGs that need to be modified in order to work with a DG context: the idea that economic growth has no limit, as well as the relevance of reducing production and consumption as the only way to make resource needs and availability compatible. These modifications would imply the abandonment of sustainable development's idea of balanced growth and the dismissal of CE vision of unlimited growth of production and consumption in cyclical flows (Barnosky et al., 2012 ). Robra and Heikkurinen (2019)  have tried to connect the paradigm of DG with the UN SDGs explaining that considering economic growth and ecological sustainability together is not acceptable from a degrowth perspective because “there is no mention of the need to reduce consumption and production in the SDGs ” (p. 6). Furthermore, as explained by these authors, several SDGs are based on concepts that drives them away from Degrowth, for instance, technology is a key factor for SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) (Srnicek and Williams, 2015 ), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) (Robra and Heikkurinen (2019)  and SDG 13 (Climate Action) (Heikkurinen, 2018 ). However, some SDGs are closer to Degrowth, i.e., SDG 10 (Reduced Inequality), SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 5 (Gender Equality).  2.4 Contribution of conceptual domains to the UN SDGs Overall, the three perspectives present opportunities and limitations for progress towards achievement of the UN SDGs. From the existing literature, it is not yet clear to which extent the accumulated knowledge under each perspective or conceptual domain (CE, DG and GG) is aligned with the grand challenges described in the UN SDGs. Conceptually, researchers have attempted to group the 17 SDGs under various categories in order to demonstrate interconnectedness between the goals and introduce binding narratives for developing approaches for transition to sustainable development (Costanza et al., 2016 ), while reducing headline points for effective policy making (Kastrinos and Weber, 2020 ). Such grouping or categories, however, differ from each other depending on the meta-goal that is of interest. Costanza et al. (2016)  for instance are interested in how SDGs contribute to measure sustainable wellbeing and they classify SDGs in three groups based in their potential contributions to natural, economic and social capital. Kastrinos and Weber (2020)  look at the SDGs to structure future policy on research and innovation and use transition management ideas to bundle SDGs in distinct but overlapping groups according to their relations with four transitions addressing the following: social needs, biosphere, innovation and governance. Kolk and Kourula (2017)  looked at the contribution of Multinational Enterprises to sustainable development from a corporate social responsibility perspective and classified SDGs into five groupings: Planet, People, Prosperity, Justice and Dignity. These classifications sometimes shared dimensions, all three for instance have one grouping related to planet, but still differed in the SDGs allocated to these groupings. While these frameworks and groupings are helpful to simplify analysis and guide policy in particular areas, they also obscure differences between the different goals that are grouped in a same category. For that reason, to better identify an agenda for future research there is need of studies systematically and severally analysing contributions to each of the 17 SDGs, before collapsing them into groupings. In terms of research using bibliometric methods, to the extent of our knowledge there are no studies specifically comparing the contribution of SDGR, CE, DG and GG to each of the UN SDGs. Bibliometric studies within the SDGR domain tend to be partial in the sense that they address one particular area of interest related to SDGs (e.g., Avelar et al., 2019 , and González García et al., 2020 , in education, Skaf et al. (2020)  on food security, Benton and Shaffer, 2016 , on the nursing profession). Exceptions are Meschede (2020)  and Sweileh (2020) . Both studies analyse contributions to all SDGs and identify that the most researched is SDG 3 (“good health and well-being”. However, the analyses are mainly descriptive and pitched at a meta-level. They not delve deeper into the scope and intensity of research according to the specific topics emerging from each of the UN SDG goals, targets and indicators. None of the above mentioned studies identifies contributions of CE, DG and GG. Bibliometric studies in the domains of DG (e.g. Vandeventer et al., 2019 ) and GG (e.g. Sakata et al., 2011 ) are scarce and have focused on specific areas. For example Vandeventer et al. (2019)  explored pathways for degrowth to replace the capitalist-growth regime and Sakata et al. (2011)  explores wind and solar energy. By contrast bibliometrics in CE are abundant. Some have focused on specific issues such as big data and CE (Nobre and Tavares, 2017 ) or new business models for CE (Camón Luis and Celma (2020)  while others explore thematic foci and gaps (e.g Homrich et al., 2018 ; Ferreira Gregorio et al., 2018 ; Tsai et al., 2020 ). None of these bibliometric studies in CE, DG and GG have systematically addressed the contributions of these domains to advancement of research on the UN SDGs. Indeed, CE literature highlights the need for more systematic studies of CE research related to SDGs (D'Amato et al., 2017 ; Ferreira Gregorio et al., 2018 ; Homrich et al., 2018 ). Similarly, there are no bibliometrics with comparison across CE, DG and GG domains. A recent partial exception is Haberl et al. (2020)  that compared the relevance of academic literature on green growth and degrowth to the reduction of use of natural resources and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. They found that degrowth gives priority to reduction of resource use and GHG emissions over GDP growth, while green growth pursues the reduction of resource use and GHG emissions without altering the growth trajectory (Haberl et al., 2020 ). There are no studies analysing the contribution of one or more domains to each of the 17 SDGs.   3 Methods 3.1 Database and analysis methodology In this study, the analysis of scientific literature is developed using a bibliometric analysis, which is a statistical technique applied to publications data that allows to examine the evolution of knowledge on a given topic during a certain period of time (Keathley-Herring et al., 2016 ; Rey-Martí et al., 2016 ). We used VosViewer and SciMat software to perform the bibliometric analysis (Abad-Segura et al., 2019 ). For data, we used the Scopus database of academic publications. While there are other databases of scientific literature (i.e., Web of Science, PubMed and Google Scholar), Scopus is recognized to be highly useful for bibliometric analysis as it contains large volume of peer-reviewed articles from various scientific fields, particularly within economics and management, and has detailed attributes or variables of included publications (Garfield, 2006 ; Ackerson and Chapman, 2014 ; Mingers and Lipitakis, 2010 ; Nascimento and Rodrigues, 2015 ). Scopus normally includes more papers that Web of Science and expands beyond encompassing new journals, eg. open access journals (Falagas et al., 2008 ; Bakkalbasi et al., 2006 ); so it may expose the readers to new topics.  3.2 Steps of the analysis This study is conducted in four phases (see Fig. 1  ). First, we selected search criteria to identify records from the database for the study, followed by a refinement of obtained records (i.e., identification and eligibility phase), narrowing the four collected samples for the analysis (i.e., inclusion phase). Then, we exported the data to VosViewer and SciMat software for statistical analysis of authors, geographies and chronological trends (i.e., analysis phase). In the latter phase, we find coincidences and associations between academic articles from four domains with the text of the UN SDGs (i.e., results and discussion phase). We present the evolution of domains of literature, such as “sustainable development goals' research” (SDGR), “circular economy” (CE), “green growth”(GG) and “degrowth” (DG), through authorship analysis, keyword analysis, as well as the journals with the most articles on each subject in which they have been published, considering Scopus Database (Van Eck and Waltman, 2014 ; Scimagojcr, 2020 ; Garfield, 2006 ; Ackerson and Chapman, 2014 ). 3.2.1 Phase 1 identification of records In total, 9484 records have been identified that included scientific articles (excluding 102 overlapped papers), books and book chapters, with a time horizon adjusted to each of the four searches made. The search for the selected terms has been carried out in the fields “article title, abstract and keywords” and include papers, books and chapter books until December 2019 included. The data was downloaded in April 2020. In this study, we selected variables according to: year of publication, thematic area, journal, author, author's country of affiliation, institution to which the author is affiliated and keywords that define the publication. It is important to note that Scopus considers affiliation that the authors had at the time of publication of each document. Thus, the same document can be associated with several countries or institutions, one for each author. In addition, it is possible that the same author has different ways to sign his articles. In this case, Scopus groups names by author to prevent different records for the same author.  3.2.2 Phase 2 eligibility and inclusion of the records Records that did not correspond to the aim of this article were excluded, because the word found had a different meaning from that related to the Sustainable Development Goals, Circular Economy, Degrowth or Green Growth. In total, 80 articles have been excluded. The samples in which the most records have been eliminated are degrowth (36) and green growth (42). The first sample is composed of 5061 records, which responds to the search for “sustainable development goals”. We note that there are items in the sample since 1992, although the SDGs were approved in 2015 the World Commission on Environment and Development had been working in the 90s on goals and targets for Sustainable Development, which resulted, in 2000, in the Millennium Development Goals. Thus, articles prior to 2015 are part of the sample of SDG Research (SDGR). The second sample, with 3270 items groups the records corresponds to the search for “circular economy”. The third sample corresponds to the search for “degrowth” and groups 399 references. Finally, the sample on “green growth” includes 776 articles.  3.2.3 Phase 3 visualization From each sample, the interactions and interrelations between authors, journals and countries have been exposed, as well as the evolution of keywords, through VosViewer (version 1.6.11), which has been widely used in the visualization of co-citation and co-occurrence maps in many bibliometric studies (Van Eck and Waltman, 2010 ). We use the keyword analysis to examine the research conceptual domains in each of the selected samples, to detect the interrelations of the scientific papers with the objectives proposed in the SDGs. Likewise, the SciMat application (Science Mapping Analysis Tool v.1.1.04) has been useful to identify articles by periods and study their evolution.  3.2.4 Phase 4 analysis The analysis of authors, journals, countries and themes is based on co-citation. Thus, for authors, the analysis of co-citation focuses on interrelations between individual authors of each article. As frequency of co-citation of authors in the analyzed documents increases, the interconnection between them becomes stronger and therefore, the supposed conceptual relationship between them increases. This stage also provides the analysis of the focus of scientific production concerning the four samples considered in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The dominant themes associated in each sample are mapped. The analysis of co-occurrences of keywords is based on keywords that appear together in the same scientific paper. This analysis is developed with the intention of identifying the conceptual and thematic structure of each sample of the conceptual domains. The results provides an overview of the topics that academics chose to explore in research related to sustainable development goal, that is the current academic research agenda. In a second stage, we analyzed the relevance of contributions from each domain (SDGR, CE, DG and GG) to the specific topics of interests for each of the 17 UN SDGs as outlined in their targets and indicators (that is the policy agenda). This analysis was carried out by associating the records to keywords that appear in the text of targets and indicator of the 17 SDGs. This association has been developed as follows:1) First, we used interpretive text analysis to identify unique and significant keywords from each of the 17 UN SDGs by analysing word frequencies in the text of targets and indicators (https://sdgs.un.org/goals ). Following Yakovleva and Vazquez-Brust (2012)  we excluded those transversal terms (e.g., “sustainable development” or “environmental policies”) that can be associated with several UN SDGs or the entire sustainable development agenda. We also excluded keywords relating to specific methodologies (e.g., “economic analysis”, “empirical analysis”, “cluster analysis” or “systematic review”) and geographical references.  2) We associated keywords from papers published in SDGR, CE, DG and GG domains to the keywords collected from 17 UN SDGs (UN, 2015 ) by matching the coincidence of academic article keywords with the keywords derived from the text of UN SDGs.  3) We constructed two variables to analyse the differences of contributions of each conceptual domains to each UN SDGs. The first variable is “intensity5  5 Data are normalized in order to show the different contribution of conceptual domains to each SDGs (For each SDGs, the conceptual domains contain the sum of keywords occurrences assigned, divided by the total occurrences for each sample).   of contributions of conceptual domain” (occurrences of keywords per SDG related to total occurrences); e.g. 4.6% for one conceptual domain indicates the percentages of occurrence of keywords related to one specific SDG that are included in the papers of the SDGs sample. The second variable is “scope” and represents how many of the UN SDGs keywords are assigned to each conceptual domain.       4 Results 4.1 Evolution of scientific production The evolution of number of papers in SDGR, CE, GG and DG is depicted in Fig. 2   for the period 1990–2019. In turn, Fig. 3   indicates the cumulative growth of scientific production from 2007 to 2019 (the cumulative growth of all research in scopus database is included for comparative purposes). Fig. 2  shows that papers in SDGR are consistently higher in number, followed by those in CE. Less is written on GG and DG. On the other hand, Fig. 3  shows that since 2011 GG and DG production has been growing at a faster rate than SDGR and CE and that cumulative growth in all four domains is substantially higher compared to the rate of growth of all research in Scopus database. After 2016., the cumulative growth of scientific production in CE and SDGR also increased dramatically.  4.2 Productivity of authors and journals Table 1   shows the most prolific authors of the four samples considered. The high number of citations of the authors corresponding to the sample of SDGR is notable, as well as their high h-index (the h-index displayed is only for papers in the topics sampled). All of them are from Anglo-Saxon countries and, on average, are the authors with the highest number of total citations per article (TC/A). In CE, the high number of papers and citations of Geng and Sarkis is remarkable. In the case of Geng, the interest of the scientific community in his work is reflected in the high h-index 19, which is the highest of the four samples considered. DG is dominated by Spanish authors, with Kalis and Demaría standing out for their TC/A. Finally, GG is headed by Ian Watson, based in South Korea while China-based Qu only started writing about GG in 2017 but already has the highest h-index. Table 2   shows the journals with the largest number of publications. Sustainability and the Journal of Cleaner Production, the first and second in the ranking, appear in all the samples. In third place is Resources Conservation and Recycling. Other journals lag substantially behind these three. By subject, DG only features in five of the ten most relevant journals of the four samples. In this case, there are other specialized journals in this area, such as Futures , Journal of Sustainable Tourism , Environmental Values and Sustainability Science . In order to represent the importance by country, the ten countries with the highest number of publications of the four samples have been selected. Table 3   presents the set of 17 countries common to the four samples. The most interesting aspect is that no country has a clear leadership in all the samples. Thus, in the sample corresponding to SDGR, authors from the United States and the United Kingdom have 44% of all articles (2214 articles out of 5061). In the case of CE, China and Italy have leadership, with 30% of the sample (996 articles out of 3270). In DG Spain and Germany stand out with 33% of the sample (136 articles on a total of 399). Finally, South Korea lead in GG with 29% of the articles in the sample (229 out of 776).  4.3 Analysis of co-occurrence of keywords in each domain The relationships between keywords6  6 In order to achieve an optimal analysis of VosViewer, the number of keywords has been adjusted as follows: Figure 4  presents 60 occurrences (9404 documents and 33,234 keywords); Figure 5 : Circular Economy: 50 occurrences (3270 documents and 16,000 keywords). Figure 6 : Degrowth: 10 occurrences (399 documents and 1787 keywords). Finally, Figure 7 : Green Growth: 15 occurrences (776 documents and 3397 keywords). In addition, we have analyzed the co-occurrence keywords of the overlapped papers in more than one sample and results do not reveal additional information.   from the four domains are shown in Fig. 4  , based on a group of 39,431 keywords and taking into account that the number of papers differs among the domains. The size of each bubble represents the number of times that each keyword has been repeated in the sample, while the lines that join them show which words usually co-appear in the articles. The results exhibit the existence of four clusters. The green cluster is formed around the circular economy, which is accompanied by other key words such as “climate change”, “environmental impact”, “recycling” or “waste management”, “energy” and “industrial economics”. The blue cluster is headed by “sustainability”, “environment”, “economy”, “stakeholders”, “degrowth” and “green growth”. We note that the co-occurrence of keywords indicates that “degrowth” and “green growth” do not create a cluster of its own but are grouped around a wider concept: “sustainability”. The red cluster is headed by “sustainable development” and “sustainable development goals” and forms a group with keywords that relate to aspects such as “health”, “global health”, “developing countries”, “inequality” and “human rights”. It is a cluster that groups social aspects of sustainable development contained in the SDGs. Finally, the yellow cluster contains others keywords, grouped around “water”: “agriculture”, “biodiversity”, “ecosystems”, “conservation” and “environmental protection”. Thus, research in the four domains groups into clusters related to CE and Climate Change, Social SDGs, Sustainability and Economic Growth and Ecosystems and water. The analysis of the keywords corresponding to each sample of articles is presented in Figs. 5 to 7    . Fig. 5  maps the relations of keywords corresponding to CE. Four clusters are identified. The red cluster groups the largest number of keywords (49) and is led by keywords such as “sustainability”, “sustainable development”, “environment”, “innovation”, “supply chain” and “eco-design”. The green cluster groups 32 keywords around “climate change”, “renewable energy”, “pollution”, “pollution” and “water”. The less important clusters are the blue cluster (22) and the yellow cluster (8). The blue cluster is led by “recycling”, “waste management”, “waste” or “recovery”, while the yellow cluster is led by keywords related to “environmental management”, “life cycle assessment (LCA)” or “plastic”. The analysis of DG keywords in Fig. 6  shows 5 clusters, although the number of articles that make up this sample is small. The red cluster is the most numerous and is grouped around “sustainability”, “sustainable development”, “wellbeing”, “ecology” and “production”. The green cluster, related to economic growth, social justice, equity and socio-economic aspects, is the second most important. The blue cluster has been formed around “social change/impact/social movement”, “environmental justice” and “growth”. The yellow and purple cluster are the smallest and are related to “climate change” and “environment” (yellow) and “tourism” (purple). Finally, Fig. 7  shows the four clusters corresponding to GG. Again, the red cluster is the most important and is grouped around “pollution”, “environmental impact”, “innovation”, “technology”, “competitiveness” and “efficacy”. The green cluster is the second most important and is grouped around climate change, emissions and energy use, so it largely corresponds to the same cluster in the circular economy sample. The blue cluster groups “sustainable development”, “sustainability”, “economy”, “environment”, “eco-growth” and “developing countries”. The yellow cluster is made up of only three key words: “environmental protection”, “environmental policy” and “policy”, so it would include articles about what Vazquez-Brust et al. (2014)  called the Green Growth State: green growth from a regulation and policy point of view.  4.4 Analysis and discussion of keywords related with 17 UN SDGs This section looks at the linkages between main topics discussed in academic literature - as captured by keywords in academic journals- and salient topics in Agenda 2030 as captured by keywords extracted from the text of the SDG goals, targets and indicators (SDG keywords). Table 4   includes: a) 10 main keywords (according with co-occurrences in scientific production) for each SDG and b) the SDGs keywords that could not be linked to keywords in scientific production in any of the conceptual domains. These missing keywords from SDG text imply that academic researchers working within the four domains do not pay sufficient attention to these concepts, as they do not appear as keywords in their research. In order to increase their relevance to SDGs, the four domains may need to embrace these topics in future research. Table 5   and Table 6   indicate respectively the “Intensity” and “Scope” of research per conceptual domains and each SDGs. Fig. 8   provides a visual representation of the intensity of research within SDGR, CE, DG and GG for each the 17 SDGs. Fig. 9   maps the relevance of research in each of SDG according to the respective “intensity” and “scope” of research in each domain. Table 6  and Fig. 8  indicate differences in the intensity of SDGR for each of the different SDGs and indicates that intensity is higher for SDG3 (Good Health and Well-Being), SDG13 (Climate Action) and SDG6 (Clean Water and Sanitation). CE research has higher intensity of contributions for SDG12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and infrastructure) DG SDG8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) and GG SDG13 (Climate Action) SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy)and SDG8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). Table 6  indicates the scopes for each conceptual domain. As could be expected, SDGR has high levels of scope (over 60%) for all the SDGs in SDGR, with the highest scope for SDG 6 (100%) and the lowest for SDG 16 (67%). CE has scope over 50% for SDG12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and very low scope in SDG5 (Gender Equality) and SDG1 (No Poverty). DG sample has low scopes in most SDGs and the lowest in SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). Scope is above 30% only for SDG10 (Reduced Inequality) Finally, GG sample presents levels of scope in between CE and DG with the highest figures for SDG12 with 50% and SDG15 (Life on Land) with 44% and the lowest for SDG 3. Interestingly, despite high levels of intensity in SDG 8, DG and GG have moderate scopes for SDG 8, suggesting that researchers focus in a substantially narrower range of topics related to economic growth than those addressed by the UN SDGs.   5 Discussion First, we discuss insights from the keyword mapping and analysis of scientific production. This analysis has the objective of understanding the agenda for sustainable development that has been explored by the academic community, its emerging themes and complementarities and differences among CE, DG, GG and SDGR domains. Second, we discuss the relevance of the contribution of academic research for the implementation of the policy agenda reflected in the UN SDGs. Third, we discuss implications for developing countries. Fourth, we explain several implications of the results. 5.1 Mapping scientific production in the four domains Fig. 4  shows than when keywords from all domains are jointly mapped four clusters emerge, the distribution of keywords in 4 clusters closely resembles Costanza et al. (2016) ’s framework for sustainable wellbeing. Costanza et al. (2016)  grouped SDGs into fair distribution, sustainable scale within planetary boundaries and efficient allocation, in accordance with the SDGs contribution to build social, natural and economic capital respectively. The main difference is that in our map keywords related to efficient allocation are split into two groups. One group is associated with the keyword CE and encompasses terms related to sustainable production, resource efficiency and industry – that as manufactured capital. The second one is linked to economic growth, employment and the environment. DG and GG, despite seemingly representing contrasting views on economic growth, are captured in this cluster, which suggest a thread of underlying similarities. This aligns with literature proposing that while semantically the constructs appear different, and their perspectives and discourse come from different “homes”, they have evolved to share similar conceptual concerns (Vazquez-Brust et al., 2014 ; Vazquez-Brust and Sarkis, 2012 ). Vazquez-Brust et al. (2014)  discuss a critical green growth perspective – which they associate with policy in East Asia- that does not propose unrestricted growth but a combination of growth in sectors improving environmental protection and degrowth in sectors environmentally damaging. Degrowth, in turn, does not propose an ever-shrinking economy but moving towards a steady-state equilibrium with a targeted reduction of growth in sectors that are socially and environmentally damaging and a shift on emphasis from growth to quality of life (Weiss and Cattaneo, 2017 ). Weiss and Cattaneo (2017)  endorse degrowth but suggest that a certain level of affluence is needed before degrowth could become popular, and point out that “growth policies may not necessarily be abandoned on a finite planet earth” (p.27). Our Keywords maps for GG and DG show that these domains have in common the presence of clusters related to eco-growth and climate change. Concerns with social justice, equity and environmental justice (linked to what Kolk and Kourula, 2017 , calls the dignity pillar of SDG) are substantially more explicit in the keyword map for Degrowth than in that of Green Growth; but gender discrimination is under-represented in both literatures. Where GG and DG differ most is in terms of keywords related to low carbon, clean energy and climate change. GG adds an explicit focus on more aspects of environmental protection; and it is therefore more comprehensive in its palette of sustainability concerns. This finding aligns with researchers observing than degrowth literature has long focused on discussing the deficiencies of the growth-oriented status-quo and would benefit from a diversified research programme (Weiss and Cattaneo, 2017). Comparing the keyword maps for CE, GG and DG, we can see the practitioner-oriented nature of CE, showing the clustering of the word “sustainability” with keywords such as business models, business studies, logistics, supply chains, production, customers; and the range of industries researched: automotive, construct building/construction, chemical study, food waste, fertilizer/agriculture, mining or urban study. Despite the noticeable overlaps between the keywords used in research stream of GG and CE, the strongest policy focus of GG shows the clustering of the word “sustainability” with words “governance” and “policy making”. There is presence of policy-related terms in all the GG clusters, including one all-policy cluster. This macro-level/ policy orientation also shows a lack of application to specific industries or interest in distinct innovations and technologies. Fittingly, being the only approach that does not have a western origin, the keyword map for GG is the only that features developing countries as keyword. The keyword map for DG is the most divergent. The robust academic foundation and social sensibility of DG are shown in the clustering of the word “sustainability” with “ecological economics” and “wellbeing”. Also in the clustering of “eco-growth” with “economic study” and “theoretical study”, keywords related to politic topics (“Socialism, Marxism, Democracy), and keywords concerning social justice and human rights. The absence of keywords associated with the practical implementation of degrowth in this sample is striking.  5.2 Relevance of each domain to SDGs Fig. 9  combines the intensity and scope of conceptual domains (SDGR, CE, DG and GG). The combination of both variables improves the results of preview tables and figures, highlighting for what SDGs the research in each conceptual domain is more relevant (high intensity and high scope). This figure allow us to compare the results of our work with previous contributions in the literature that indicated a potential linkage of each trend to the different SDGs. Although we could expect that SDGR should be connected with all SDGs, our analysis indicates that SDGR sample is most strongly linked with SDG3 (Good Health and Well-being), with a very important difference in intensity and scope compared to others SDGs. This aligns with findings of Meschede (2020)  and Sweileh (2020)  about the most researched SDG. They also correspond with the aggrupation of keywords around the red cluster in Fig. 6  that highlights keywords related to SDG 3. According with previous literature (see section 2.1), CE should be strongly related to the achievement of SDGs 12, 9, 13, 12 and 15 with potential synergies with SDGs 1, 2 and 14. Our results show that CE is highly relevant for SDG12 (Responsible Consumption and Production). These results are consistent with Fig. 6  and Fig. 7 , where CE is associated to keywords such as “recycling”, “waste management”, “resource use” or “supply chain”. According to the literature review (section 2.3), DG research relates to SDGs 2, 5 and 10. Our results show a greater relevance for SDG8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). Keywords related to SDG 8 are also prominent in Fig. 8 : “economic growth”, “growth rate” or “growth”. Lastly, according to the literature review (section 2.2), GG is closer to Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8). However, our results point out higher relevance for SDG13 (Climate Action), followed by SDG7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 8. These results are consistent with prominent keywords in Fig. 9 , related to SDG13 (“climate change”, “emissions” or “pollutions”); SDG7 (“energy” or “renewable energy”) and SDG8 (“economic growth”). Is the literature on the emergent SDGR domain more aligned with CE, DG or GG in terms of relevance of contributions to UN SDG? Our results show that SDGR is different from the other three conceptual domains in terms of itsscope, which is consistently high, thus indicating a comprehensive coverage of the issues targeted by UN SDGs. In terms of intensity of research contribution to each SDG, the only commonality among the 4 domains is the focus on SDG13 (Climate Action). SDGR and DG are also connected through their relevance (scope and intensity) to SDG3 (Good Health and Well-being). Is CE more aligned with DG or GG in terms of relevance? Our works emphasises the connection of CE to DG and GG through their common relevance for SDG13 (Climate Action) but also identifies a connection of CE with GG based on similar levels of relevance of contributions to SDG9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure). Our analysis suggest that CE is different from DG and GG in its high relevance for sustainable consumption and production (SDG 12), which is not the case for DG and GG. Conversely, CE literature is much less relevant to economic growth (SDG 8) than GG and DG literature are. The analysis of relevance of contribution for each of the SDGs shows higher intensity of research contributing to SDG 8 in DG than in GG. GG and DG also differ in intensity of contribution to affordable and clean energy (SDG 7) and climate action (SDG 13) and scope of contribution to life on earth and life on water. GG's scope is 44% for SDG 14 and 24% for SDG 15 against 22% for SDG 14 and 12% for SDG 15. Overall, the analysis reveals heterogeneity in the relevance of research for each SDG. The pattern for SDGR, CE and DG is similar in the sense that high relevance to one particular SDG clearly stands out; while GG shows a more distributed pattern with moderate relevance for several SDGs. These findings support the complementarity of the research domains and suggest that more research is needed to aggregate knowledge currently severed in disciplinary silos. To summarize differences in the intensity of contributions of CE, DG, and GG to UN SDGs we group the SDGs following the sustainable wellbeing framework by Costanza et al. (2016)  since this framework is well recognized and more closely resembles the linkages between keywords that emerged from our analysis (see Table 7  ). Under this conceptual lens, CE, DG and GG share a bias in focus towards research looking at Efficient Allocation. CE shows the lowest intensity of research in Fair Distribution and SDGR the highest. Sustainable Scale is the less contributed dimension, with DG showing the lowest intensity of research and GG the highest.  5.3 Contextualizing for the needs of developing countries The UN has emphasised the contingent nature of progress towards the SDGs, and the need for countries to contextualize the implementation strategies. We question which of the literatures is more aligned with the needs of developing countries? Keyword maps and Table 3  show which countries generate more research on GG, and 34% of papers in GG come from developing countries. GG is followed by CE with 20% of knowledge production from developing countries and SDG with 18%. Only 5% of published research on DG comes from authors based in developing countries. The origin of knowledge is important beyond the obvious application in home countries, because studies on South-South collaboration suggest that policy makers in developing countries are particularly interested in learning from policy success and knowledge produced in other developing countries, thus GG and CE research is more likely to be perceived as suitable guidance than DG research.  5.4 Implications In a recent report for the Club of Rome, Randers et al. (2018)  argue that conventional policy tools cannot handle the trade-off between the socially oriented and the environmentally oriented SDGs, thus bold new ideas are needed to transform policy. Hofstetter et al. (2021)  argue that scientific research should have a central role in the generation of new ideas, but this is prevented by a divide between the interests and thematic foci of academics and practitioners. Our research highlights specific areas in the policy agenda set by the UN SDGs that are lacking academic attention. This may be relevant for future research opportunities. Table 4  lists keywords from the UN SDGs that are missing in the papers written by academics within the 4 knowledge domains (SDGR, CE, DG, and GG), and this suggests that academics working within these four domains could do more to align their research agenda with the needs of the UN SDGs and its policy agenda. On the other hand, the analysis of maps of keywords of academic research reveals the importance of certain topics, that might be embedded, but are not explicitly included in the wording of UN SDG's, nor in the wording of their targets and indicators. For instance equity, social justice, and environmental justice (observed in DG research). This supports commentaries arguing that the current UN SD agenda itself is limited and perhaps policy makers need to look into novel concepts that are growing in their significance among academics to bring about radical policy change or to achieve a more detailed definition of some targets. In this regards, DG, more distant ideologically from the current SDG policy mindset, offers more avenues to expand the UN agenda than GG. Could these keywords from academic research on SDGs serve as potential topics for further policy development beyond 2030? The history of UN goals demonstrate that the breadth of goals grew from the Millennium Development Goals (8 goals to be achieved from 2000 to 2015) to the Sustainable Development Goals (17 goals to be achieved from 2015 to 2030). We suspect that new targets may be added to the existing goals but the number of goals will be reduced, as many reports from academia, civil society, industry, international development organizations and policy makers have been attempting to group or reduce the goals (e.g., under 5Ps: People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace and Partnerships) (see: Mello-Oliveira and Navega, 2017 ; Partnership Secretariat of GIZ, 2020 ). A methodological contribution of our work is the novel approach used to analyse the contributions of research to the UN SDGs. Our approach allows comparative analysis of the relevance of research for specific SDGs, combining bibliometrics with text analysis. Relevance, based on intensity and scope, calls for the development of longitudinal studies in the future, which, applying this framework, may gauge the contributions to SDGS, as well as the new gaps that should receive the attention of the researchers. In addition, our work has potential application to business, industry and organizations. Previous works have pointed out that companies need to align their values and capabilities with UN SDGs (Anwar and El-Bassiouny, 2020 ) and for this, it is important to have a holistic way to work on the SDGs (Eccles and Karbassi, 2018 ; Anwar and El-Bassiouny, 2020 ). Our study may assist companies to understand how each of the conceptual domains (GG, DG and CE) embraces the needs of specific UN SDGs. Considering the company and its decision to go for a sustainable strategy in one of these certain ways can help you assess which SDGs the companyis closest to or contributes more to.   6 Conclusions Our analysis demonstrates that the four knowledge domains examined: CE, DG, GG and the emerging domain labelled SDGR, have made important contributions to research relating to the 17 UN SDGs, but each domain is skewed towards one or two main SDG's, notably SDG 3, SDG 12, SDG 8 and SDG 13. SDG 13 is addressed across all domains whereas relevance of the domains for SDG 1, SDG 5, SDG 14 and SDG 17 is consistently low. Our analysis of scope further indicates that there are aspects and nuances of the UN SDGs that are not sufficiently addressed by academic publications, while some topics of growing interest to academics exceed or challenge the breadth of UN SDG agenda. Overall, our results integrate information about scientific production across different knowledge domains to highlight the divide between academics and policy-makers working on sustainable development. Such divide is an opportunity for further research and potential avenues for improving the relevance of all four conceptual domains to global sustainable development agenda. Early commentaries on the UN SDGs warned that the SDGs were strongly interdependent and should never be treated in isolation. However, the ambiguity regarding implementation at an industry level and weaknesses in the definition of targets and indicators (see Oyevaar et al., 2016 ) have led to some businesses and governments adopting a selective “pick & mix” strategy for implementation where they chose the UN SDGs they feel more confident to advance (Vazquez-Brust et al., 2020 ). Our research suggests that such “siloed progress” coalesces with skewed knowledge accumulation in the approaches more likely to be used by businesses (e.g., CE) and policy makers (e.g., GG) as preferred pathways to guide their contribution towards the UN SDGs. What is the way forward? To answer that question, we take a leaf from the ground-breaking book “The Politics of the Earth” (Dryzek, 1998 ). John Dryzek classified environmental discourses according to how they framed the departure needed from the discourse of industrialism. Industrialism is committed to growth in products and services and the material well-being that growth brings. The departure from industrialism can be reformist (adjusting and correcting the economic system) or radical (disrupting or replacing the economic system). Reformist discourses see change as a slow gradual process and face less resistance. Radical discourses seek dramatic change but face strong resistance from incumbent powers. Applying such classification, DG could be seen as a radical discourse. As such, DG arguments about the need to curb growth, despite being intellectually robust, are portrayed in a manner unlikely to generate consensus for policy adoption, particularly among developing countries. Whilst SD, GG and CE can be seen as reformist discourses, as they are variations of the narrative: “the political economy needs reconfiguring and far-sighted action so that economic development and environmental protection can proceed hand in hand and reinforce each other” (Dryzek, 1998, p. 143). Our work has limitations. Specially, we recognized the limitations associated to bibliometric research and the use of keywords as an element of analysis to examinethe contribution of the conceptual domains in the different SDGs. Bibliometric analysis has allowed the management of a large volume of scientific publications but further research could use systematic literature reviews to delve deeper in the areas for aggregation of the knowledge here outlined. Sustainable Development Agenda proposes a collaboration between states, business, experts and civic society. However, CE narrative is framed to appeal to businesses, GG narrative targets governments, SDGR narrative emphasises transnational collaboration and targets civil society, and DG narrative resonates with the academic community. Future research could look for research agendas that create bridges to exploit synergies between SDGR, CE, GG and DG, looking for creative ways to address the tensions between theory driven DG, policy driven GG and practitioner-driven CE; particularly in the context of developing economies.
