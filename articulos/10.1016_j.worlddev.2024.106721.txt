                  The Sustainable Development Goals are intended to be implemented in an indivisible manner, underlining the importance of interlinkages and interdependencies between different SDG-relevant policy areas. The complexity of synergies and trade-offs that are inherent to SDG interactions increases the risk that governments cherry-pick the SDGs that align with current policy interests and priorities, while neglecting others. No development actor can single-handedly ensure the integrated implementation of sustainable development’s economic, environmental and social dimensions. To advance integrated development processes, we therefore seek to answer the following question: what governance mechanisms enable development actors, located in different sectors, in different jurisdictions and at different governance levels, to align their efforts? Drawing on public governance and international development literature we identify ten alignment mechanisms that can be used to create inter-departmental alignment, public–private alignment, donor-recipient alignment and inter-donor alignment. To understand how the different mechanisms manifest themselves in practice, we illustrate how they are used to create synergies and negotiate trade-offs in forest and landscape restoration governance in Ethiopia. Through 20 interviews with public and private actors in Ethiopia, we observe a movement toward more integrated forest and landscape restoration efforts, but also that important mechanisms to create synergies and negotiate trade-offs between different objectives are still missing or do not function as intended. In the discussion and conclusion, we provide insights on how the ten mechanisms can contribute to greater multi-actor alignment at different stages of the policy cycle.

The underlying reason is that Sweden does not work directly with the federal government for political reasons and therefore channels its funding for the forestry sector through UNDP [SIDA]. Also the Norway-funded REDD Investment Programme is partly financed through a UNDP trust fund. The fund supports the government with procurement and the hiring of consultants to develop and implement certain programme components. World Bank and UNDP trust funds hire highly qualified technical personnel who are then seconded to the government, for example the MoA, EFD and the CRGE Facility. These employees receive better salaries than regular government employees, with the idea that this will retain them for the longer term and thus ensure more continuity [Canada, UNDP1, Norad]. For example, the Forest Sector Transformation Unit is a unit within EFD with highly qualified employees who are hired through UNDP [EFD2]. The unit fosters innovation in the forestry sector and creates transformative impact by introducing new technologies, equipment and training to improve seed quality, seedling planting and forestry entrepreneurship. It also focuses on designing inclusive, culturally sensitive and empowering restoration models to strengthen the work of sub-national forestry departments and with the idea that these models can be upscaled [EFD2].

The SDGs seek to balance the economic, environmental and social dimensions of sustainable development (Biggeri, Clark, Ferrannini, & Mauro, 2019; Cling & Delecourt, 2022 ) and are meant to guide governments and non-state actors in addressing cross-cutting and interconnected societal challenges (Nilsson, Griggs, Visbeck, Ringler, & McCollum, 2017 ). As opposed to earlier development agendas that were focused on a restricted set of dimensions, the 17 SDGs offer a multi-dimensional view on development with the aim to move humanity into a safe and just operating space (Beisheim, 2018; Nilsson et al., 2017; Pradhan, Costa, Rybski, Lucht, & Kropp, 2017 ). This includes a focus on the rule of law and the quality of institutions (Cling & Delecourt, 2022 ). The SDGs are more closely interlinked compared to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were plagued by sectoral fragmentation that resulted in a siloed approach (Stafford-Smith et al., 2017 ). The sector-specific goals of the MDGs paid little attention to the impact that progress in one sector had on other sectors (Breuer, Leininger, Malerba, & Tosun, 2023 ). By contrast, Agenda 2030 points out the challenges associated with prevailing sectoral approaches of decision-making and highlights the need to address interdependencies between policy domains (England et al., 2018; OECD, 2018 ). While most SDGs are anchored in one specific dimension of sustainable development, many incorporate elements from all dimensions into their targets (Nilsson et al., 2017 ). In fact, the SDGs are intended to be “indivisible” (UN, 2015 ), meaning that integrated approaches are at the heart of achieving Agenda 2030 (Bennich, Weitz, & Carlsen, 2020; Biggeri et al., 2019; Nilsson et al., 2018; OECD, 2016 ). Such integrated approaches should be based on an understanding of the context-specific dynamics related to SDG interdependencies (Cling & Delecourt, 2022; Nilsson et al., 2017; Veland, Gram-Hanssen, Maggs, & Lynch, 2022 ). Agenda 2030 was built on the fundamental insight that systemic change cannot be achieved through single-actor approaches, but that alignment across sectors, levels and societal actors is required (Breuer et al., 2023 ). When policy domains are complementary, there is potential to leverage synergies through mutually supportive policy actions (Nilsson et al., 2017; OECD, 2016 ). However, SDG attainment can also be characterised by conflict and trade-offs between the objectives, instruments and implementation modalities of different policy domains (Barbier & Burgess, 2019; Pradhan et al., 2017 ). Trade-offs may require additional regulation and structural policy changes to minimise the adverse effects that policy domains have on each other when attaining their goals (Nilsson, Griggs, & Visbeck, 2016; Pickering, 2023 ). Coherent policy frameworks achieve high levels of synergy and consistency between policy objectives, instruments and implementation modalities (Shawoo, Maltais, Dzebo, & Pickering, 2022 ). This includes making active decisions about trade-offs between policy objectives, when these cannot be avoided, so that different policy domains do not work at cross-purposes. The practical implementation of the “indivisible” SDG framework through coherent policy frameworks challenges existing sectoral public institutions and administrative processes, and requires concrete guidance for development actors on the policy challenges they can expect in the policy design and implementation process (Breuer et al., 2023; OECD, 2018, 2023; Weitz, Carlsen, Nilsson, & Skånberg, 2018 ). Yet, there is no UN framework to govern the integrated implementation of the 17 goals, nor is there general agreement on how SDG interactions can best be approached in policy-relevant ways (Bennich et al., 2020; Veland et al., 2022 ). The complexity of designing integrated policy actions to implement the Goals became clear soon after the SDGs were adopted and countries started elaborating their first National Voluntary Reviews (OECD, 2018; Weitz et al., 2018 ). In general, governments focused on implementing the SDGs in a way that has tended to strengthen policy areas and objectives that were already prioritised. No significant changes have been made to public budgets to align national development priorities to Agenda 2030 or to create new or adjusted cross-sectoral policies and initiatives (Biermann et al., 2022 ). However, policy alignment is key to localising the SDGs (Jönsson & Bexell, 2021 ), and tailoring sustainable development strategies to local contexts also requires alignment between governance levels (Biggeri, 2021; Bilsky, Moreno, & Fernández Tortosa, 2021 ). Implementing the SDGs in an indivisible way is not merely a coordination challenge; it is an inherently political undertaking due to the trade-offs that need to be negotiated (Nilsson & Weitz, 2019; Visseren-Hamakers, 2015 ). To improve understanding of how policy coherence is encouraged or hindered, a distinction can be made between ideas, institutions and interests (Patay, Friel, Schram, & Sell, 2023; Shawoo et al., 2022 ). First, ideas – which may differ across policy domains – shape the ways in which coherence is defined. The degree of policy coherence is influenced by dominant discourses that favour certain issues and policy domains at the expense of others (Breuer et al., 2023; Pickering, 2023 ). Second, actors from different policy domains have different interests, and different degrees of authority to pursue these interests (Patay et al., 2023 ). Vested interests can cause policy-makers to avoid attempts to make progress on some goals, when this entails significant trade-offs with their own development priorities (Nilsson et al., 2017 ). Powerful actors may have an interest in maintaining incoherent policies if these foster their objectives and allow them to avoid painful compromises. In such cases, achieving policy coherence may require changing the balance of power (Shawoo et al., 2022 ). Third, institutions enable or constrain interaction among multiple actors, defining the rules of the game in efforts to achieve policy coherence. Institutional capacity, the level of centralisation and decentralisation, and regulatory backing place some policy actors in a better position to attain certain SDGs than others (Shawoo et al., 2022 ). Institutionalised relations between public and private actors shape the opportunities for (marginalised) actors and the general public to participate in the design of SDG efforts and priorities. Policy incoherence is not a challenge that can simply be solved through greater coordination among actors and other technocratic measures. It is rather a political choice of governments to establish the mechanisms that explicitly reconcile the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development and foster policy coherence in a contextually sensitive manner (OECD, 2018, 2023 ). The political feasibility of aligning ideas, promoting inter-institutional coordination and balancing divergent interests will vary from government to government. However, when SDG interlinkages and interdependencies are not considered and governments only cherry-pick the SDGs that align with current policy interests and priorities, existing development challenges will exacerbate and new challenges will emerge on the long-term. This will prevent the SDGs from enabling transformative societal change (Stafford-Smith et al., 2017; Veland et al., 2022 ). Clarity is needed on the mechanisms that bring about alignment between different types of actors, to go beyond individual measures in individual policy domains (Beisheim, 2018; Breuer et al., 2023 ). This requires identifying the best governance mechanisms that can realise the SDGs in an integrated way, despite the considerable political obstacles that may exist in specific contexts that prevent policy coherence from being achieved. Multi-actor alignment necessitates creating institutional structures that provide a level playing field for – both strong and weak – public actors and non-state actors who may hold divergent interests during the policy design and implementation phases (Patay, Friel, Schram, & Sell, 2023 ). To date, there is no comprehensive overview of mechanisms that can address the challenges posed by SDG interactions, by aligning policy domains and societal spheres (Breuer et al., 2023 ), nor is there a clear understanding of how these mechanisms play out in practice. While the political drivers of policy coherence and alignment remain important, our main aim is to provide a holistic and coherent account of alignment mechanisms, to better analyse their practical relevance for SDG implementation. In this contribution, we seek to answer the following question: what mechanisms enable development actors, located in different sectors, in different jurisdictions and at different governance levels, to align their efforts to advance integrated development processes? Alignment mechanisms have long since been used to address the well-known problem of fragmentation in public governance and international development assistance (Leiderer, 2015 ). Understanding the use of alignment mechanisms to create synergies and negotiate trade-offs in existing governance processes will allow better application of these mechanisms for integrated SDG implementation.  2 Governing SDG interactions through multi-actor alignment National governments are encouraged to develop ambitious responses to Agenda 2030 (UN, 2015 ) and are responsible for the domestic implementation of the SDGs (Stafford-Smith et al., 2017 ). However, no single actor has the required knowledge, expertise, technology and financial resources to fully address the economic, environmental and social dimensions of sustainable development (Beisheim & Simon, 2018 ). Achieving the SDGs necessarily depends on the decisions of public and private actors who are located across different sectors, jurisdictions and governance levels (Breuer, Janetschek, & Malerba, 2019 ), and their inclusion in policy design and implementation is required to achieve effective and sustainable results (Biggeri et al., 2019; Glass & Newig, 2019 ). The implementation of the SDGs specifically requires more attention to be paid to the interlinkages between sectors, between societal actors, and between lower and higher income countries (Guerrero, Guariso, & Castañeda, 2023; Stafford-Smith et al., 2017 ). The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has made significant norm-setting efforts to reduce fragmentation across sectors, jurisdictions and societal spheres in the international development domain (OECD, 2018 ). It has pooled experiences and good practices from donors and recipient countries to design a shared system of principles and guidelines (Dalil et al., 2014; OECD, 2003 ). These include the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, Accra Action Agenda and Busan Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation (OECD, 2008b, 2008a, 2012b ) that put forward principles aimed at improving the quality of development assistance by seeking to align donor-recipient relationships and harmonise donor–donor relationships (Chasukwa & Banik, 2019; OECD, 2008b, 2008a; Rogerson, 2005 ). In addition, the OECD has put forward principles for effective private sector engagement in international development (GPEDC, 2019 ). The OECD has also offered normative guidance on Policy Coherence for Development (PCD) (OECD, 2016, 2018 ), which has sought to systematically promote mutually reinforcing policy actions and reduce trade-offs between development cooperation and other sector policies (OECD, 2004 ). The OECD played an instrumental role in bringing about a shift from PCD to Policy Coherence for Sustainable Development (PCSD) when Agenda 2030 was adopted (Brand, Furness, & Keijzer, 2021 ). PCSD considers policy interactions across the economic, environmental and social dimensions of sustainable development, including their synergies and trade-offs (Bali Swain & Ranganathan, 2021; Breuer et al., 2019; Glass & Newig, 2019; Mbanda & Fourie, 2020; Nilsson et al., 2017; OECD, 2016; UN, 2015 ). The concept has become an integral part of the SDG discourse ever since, reflecting a conviction that a transformative governance approach is needed; away from compartmentalised forms of decision-making (Nilsson & Weitz, 2019 ). To reduce unintended consequences in SDG implementation, navigating trade-offs in a transparent and equitable manner requires particular attention (Shawoo et al., 2022 ). While addressing the political factors that influence policy processes is needed, PCSD itself focuses less on the political hurdles that need to be overcome and more on better policy dialogue, design, assessment and coordination processes to systematically integrate economic, environmental and social concerns at all stages of policy making (Brand et al., 2021; OECD, 2018, 2023; Shawoo et al., 2022 ). The OECD has facilitated the design of aid effectiveness and policy coherence norms for national governments. However, it has not comprehensively specified the mechanisms to achieve horizontal and vertical alignment between different groups of actors (Vazquez-Brust, Piao, de Melo, Yaryd, & Carvalho, 2020), but has rather described these in a fragmented way. By building on the public governance and international development literature, we identified ten alignment mechanisms that we divided into four actor constellations: alignment mechanisms A.) between government departments ; B.) between public and private actors ; C.) between donors and recipients ; and D.) between donors . Mechanisms that can be found in both the global South and global North include those that facilitate alignment between government departments, and that seek alignment between public and private actors. Meanwhile, mechanisms that are specifically relevant to development settings in the global South are those seeking to create alignment between donors and recipients, and between donors. In Sections 3 to 6 , we discuss a broader literature review of the ten alignment mechanisms that we identified in the public governance and international development literature. To understand how the different mechanisms manifest in practice and what their potential is to integrate sustainable development’s economic, environmental and social dimensions, we analyse their role in promoting forest and landscape restoration at the national and sub-national governance level in Ethiopia as an illustrative case study. While the SDGs’ indivisible nature is a key design strength aimed at preventing cherry-picking selected goals while neglecting others, this proves to be particularly problematic when it comes to the interaction between environmental and economic growth-oriented objectives (Cling & Delecourt, 2022; Coscieme, Mortensen, & Donohue, 2021 ). Forest and landscape restoration policies seek to simultaneously improve ecological integrity and human wellbeing in deforested or degraded landscapes (Mansourian, 2017; Wiegant, van Oel, & Dewulf, 2022 ). Ethiopia is one of the frontrunners in Africa in promoting forest and landscape restoration (Wiegant, Mansourian, Eshetu, & Dewulf, 2023 ), in a context of widespread soil erosion, social disparity and poverty (Ariti, van Vliet, & Verburg, 2019; Providoli, Gete, Kiteme, Amare, & Mwangi, 2019 ). It is therefore important that landscape restoration efforts take place in a way that balances economic, environmental and social objectives. The landscape approach has been used to govern the interdependencies between multiple land-based objectives, by creating synergies and negotiating trade-offs in line with the interests and needs of actors that either depend on a landscape or seek to influence it (Breuer et al., 2019; Mansourian & Parrotta, 2019; van Oosten, Uzamukunda, & Runhaar, 2018 ). To identify how alignment mechanisms work in practice we adopted an exploratory case study design at the federal level. In November 2022, we conducted 20 interviews with sector departments, multilateral and bilateral donors, research institutes and CSOs working on forest and landscape restoration in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (Figure 1  ). We used a purposive sampling strategy to identify restoration actors. A decision to interview was based on the perceived central role of potential interviewees in departmental and donor policy processes, or in non-state efforts related to forest and landscape restoration. The first author’s previous experiences within this domain in Ethiopia ensured that knowledgeable individuals were approached for an interview. We used our evolving literature review on alignment mechanisms, presented in Sections 3 through 6 , as the basis for our interview checklist. The checklist included questions on alignment practices between sector departments, public and private actors, donors and recipients, and between donors, and questions on the integration of economic, environmental and social dimensions in forest and landscape restoration. The interviews were geared toward identifying practices that facilitate development actors to design and implement integrated forest and landscape restoration efforts. The semi-structured nature of the interviews provided the openness to discuss any landscape restoration-oriented alignment practices that the interviewees considered relevant. With regard to limitations, it must be highlighted that studying policy coherence in an authoritarian country like Ethiopia (The Economist Intelligence Unit, 2021 ) comes with challenges, since people are in general hesitant to openly reflect on the distribution of power among development actors, which influences their alignment and integrated SDG attainment. Figure 1  lists the organisational codes that are used to support the evidence in Sections 3 through 6 , as well as their meaning. If one person of an organisation was interviewed, we only place the organisation’s code in between brackets […], while in cases where multiple interviews within one organisation were conducted, a number is added to the code. In this way, [UNDP2] refers to the second interview with an employee of the United Nations Development Programme. We recorded and fully transcribed the interviews to create a thick description (Geertz, 1973 ) of alignment mechanisms in Ethiopia’s forest and landscape restoration domain. A thick description provides rich, detailed data about the research context. This allows researchers to gain a deep understanding of the interviewees’ experiences of what is happening in the empirical world (Charmaz, 1996 ). The interview transcripts were coded using ATLAS.ti software. We used sensitising concepts, including the alignment mechanisms from our literature review, to analyse the data. We condensed, clustered, sorted and linked the data (Miles & Huberman, 1994; Tesch, 1990 ) and followed different leads to contribute to a better understanding of the alignment mechanisms and their role in designing and implementing integrated restoration efforts in the Ethiopian context. In the following Sections 3 to 6 , we elaborate on the ten alignment mechanisms that we have identified in the public governance and international development literature. In Figure 2  , we position the ten mechanisms in the broader development actor landscape, and schematically show between which actors they can create alignment. We note that reality may deviate from what is portrait in Figure 2  and actors may fall in different categories. For example, in some contexts academic institutions are public, while some private sector actors can be semi-public. To understand the influence of these alignment mechanisms in practice, we illustrate for each how it manifests itself in Ethiopia’s forest and landscape restoration domain.  3 Governance mechanisms for inter-departmental alignment While the existence of distinct sector departments is essential to cultivate and retain the expertise, know-how and capacity needed to govern different policy domains (Klijn & Koppenjan, 2016; Shawoo et al., 2022 ), the SDGs raise the need to create synergies and negotiate trade-offs between sectoral policy objectives, instruments and implementation processes (Brand et al., 2021; Nilsson et al., 2017; OECD, 2016; Pradhan et al., 2017 ). This requires decision spaces that involve and give voice to a range of public actors, to explore how policy domains are interconnected and transform siloed policy processes (Bennich et al., 2020 ). We identified four inter-departmental alignment mechanisms. 3.1 Alignment through Centre of Government efforts The Centre of Government is the most important place to guide whole-of-government action (Breuer et al., 2023; Shawoo et al., 2022 ), by changing the ways in which sector departments interact (England et al., 2018 ). Actors at the Centre of Government include the offices of the President and Prime Minister, the Ministry of Finance or a National Planning Commission. They have the mandate, expertise and experience to convene relevant public actors and shape national debate on how to achieve the SDGs. As opposed to sector departments, actors at the Centre of Government are able to establish norms and provide process transparency to resolve cross-sector inconsistencies and create a level playing field for actors in all relevant policy domains (Ansell & Gash, 2007; OECD, 2018, 2019, 2023 ). By drawing on their hierarchical authority, actors at the Centre of Government can change policy processes that show systematic under-representation of certain actors, viewpoints or interests (Ansell & Gash, 2007; Klijn & Koppenjan, 2016; Scharpf, 1978 ) and address policies that are considered harmful to other policy domains, other countries or future generations (OECD, 2016 ). They can re-design the government’s institutional set-up, by establishing a dedicated agency that keeps oversight over cross-sector interactions or by creating a cabinet committee that brings together various sectors to design cross-cutting policies (Peters, 2018; Scharpf, 1978 ). If creating synergies and negotiating trade-offs is hindered by policy domain conflicts and uncertainties related to the responsibilities of each department, actors at the Centre of Government can establish procedures to obtain the certainty needed to facilitate interaction and clarify departmental responsibilities (Klijn & Koppenjan, 2016; Stringer et al., 2014 ). To successfully create cross-sector synergies and negotiate trade-offs, it is important that actors at the Centre of Government understand the merit of having a diversity of viewpoints and interests to reach the SDGs in an integrated way. Centre of Government efforts in practice : in Ethiopia, the Ministry of Planning and Development (MoPD) and Ministry of Finance and Economic Cooperation (MoFEC) are important departments to establish cross-sector alignment. The MoPD has the mandate to give technical support to sector departments in order to align sector plans to national development objectives [CIFOR, MoA, MoPD, UNDP2]. Crucial for inter-departmental alignment, MoPD is hosting the National Integrated Land Use Planning office, which is responsible to oversee the development of a national land use plan and policy [WB]. While it has taken longer than expected to establish a robust mandate for the office and develop its expertise [EPA, SIDA, WB, MoPD], multiple actors have emphasized that a neutral land use planning authority to negotiate trade-offs between different land-claiming sector departments, like agriculture, forestry and biodiversity, is imperative [EPA, EFD2, GIZ1, SIDA, WB]. The MoFEC focuses on mobilising resources to meet national development objectives, and manages cooperation with bilateral and multilateral donors [MoFEC, MoPD, UNDP2]. The MoFEC has been leading efforts to establish the Special Fund for the Green Legacy and Landscape Restoration to finance the Prime Minister office’s Green Legacy Initiative, which seeks to plant 20 billion trees [EFD2, MoFEC]. The Fund is unique as it will be the first time that domestic revenues – between 0.5 and 1 percent of the annual federal budget – are structurally allocated to implement and sustain large-scale tree planting and forest conservation efforts [MoFEC, UNDP1]. The MoFEC wants to avoid that the Special Fund exclusively finances the forestry sector, as this may trigger other sectors to demand their own Special Fund as well. It will rather be a cross-sector fund for the agriculture, forestry and water sectors [CIFOR]. Yet, in its current form, the Special Fund is not expected to be a mechanism that will explicitly balance the economic, environmental and social dimensions of sustainable development [CIFOR].  3.2 Alignment through inter-departmental collaboration A more decentralised approach to creating alignment is by bringing sector departments together in inter-departmental committees and working groups of high-level civil servants (OECD, 2019 ). They offer a venue to facilitate dialogue and share information between policy domains, foster a culture of collaboration and create shared objectives that benefit all actors involved (Shawoo et al., 2022 ). Inter-departmental committees and working groups are often well-placed to identify cross-cutting issues and interdependencies between SDGs, and can prepare the groundwork for Cabinet meetings where political decisions are taken to balance the interdependencies between Agenda 2030′s economic, environmental and social dimensions and define responsibilities (Breuer et al., 2023 ). Where a wide range of sector departments interacts and shares ideas, different interests and perspectives are brought into the policy process (OECD, 2018 ). By constantly analysing a cross-cutting challenge from different angles and finding ways to convince others of the relevance of different interests, more thoughtful policies can emerge that are influenced by a broad range of considerations (Lindblom, 1979 ). This requires an inclusive process that offers all relevant actors the opportunity to deliberate about policy design and implementation (Ansell & Gash, 2007 ). This may be a time-consuming process of pushing and pulling between actors with uncertain outcomes, where it is important to prevent early fixations on specific policy frames and to focus on incrementally discovering common grounds (Klijn & Koppenjan, 2016 ). Inter-departmental collaboration in practice : in Ethiopia, a National Forest Landscape Restoration Platform was launched in 2022 to align the restoration efforts of the federal agriculture (MoA), forestry (EFD) and water (MoWE) sector departments [WRI, NABU, GIZ1]. The platform is convened by EFD and WRI, with the idea that the three sector departments and CSOs with restoration experience come together on an annual basis to share policy progress, exchange ideas, facilitate learning about legal, institutional and technical restoration challenges, and strengthen implementation and monitoring capacity [WRI, MoA, CIFOR]. The platform is expected to play a harmonising role when it comes to the restoration indicators that are monitored and reported, to better understand how Ethiopia is progressing with international restoration pledges such as the Bonn Challenge [WRI]. Given the existing capacity gaps in the public sector, WRI and other CSOs are providing technical assistance to the government platform to improve the governance of landscape restoration efforts at the federal level [WRI]. Landscape governance platforms that bring different sector departments together have also been established at the sub-national level. One example is the Southwest Forest Alliance that was launched in 2021 to facilitate the agriculture and environment sector departments at regional, zonal and district level in the Southwest Regional State to come together to exchange ideas, create synergies and negotiate trade-offs between different policy objectives [GIZ2, NABU]. The platform was established with GIZ support and is chaired by the head of the regional Bureau of Forest, Environmental Protection and Climate Change. Besides the Bureau of Agriculture and Bureau of Forest, regional members include the investment commission and employment development enterprise, while zonal members include the job creation and cooperative department, justice office and zonal administrators who have the political authority to make decisions on agricultural investments in their zone [NABU]. During platform meetings, the different departments discuss forest governance challenges and identify policy gaps, such as land use planning, alternative livelihoods and law enforcement, and receive training on forest degradation and restoration to promote evidence-based decision-making [NABU].  3.3 Alignment through policy integration The integration of different policy domains can also occur by mainstreaming specific cross-cutting issues in the work of multiple sector departments, such as gender equality, climate action and environmental conservation (Candel & Biesbroek, 2016; Shawoo et al., 2022; Visseren-Hamakers, 2018 ). It plays a central role in balancing the often divergent dimensions of sustainable development and ensuring that policies aimed at attaining one SDG also contribute to advancing others (OECD, 2018, 2023 ). Departments can establish dedicated units or working groups of specialists to examine cross-cutting issues in the context of their sector. The integration of cross-cutting issues to promote integrated development pathways can also play a role when aligning the interests of multiple donors, and those of donors and recipients. For example, policy dialogues that occur as part of bilateral and multilateral development cooperation efforts provide opportunities to draw attention to cross-cutting issues that might otherwise have a low profile in recipient countries, and can facilitate their integration into national development policies and plans (OECD, 2014 ). Cross-cutting issues can be integrated into a department’s overarching policy frame, across all or several of its specific objectives or instruments, or by recognising the issues as a stand-alone objective within different units of a department (Candel & Biesbroek, 2016 ). Creating dedicated units, implementation guidelines and increasing the number of cross-cutting issue specialists can only translate into lasting results when these are backed by the authority, resources, incentives and accountability systems required to influence policy design and implementation throughout a department (OECD, 2014 ). Budget processes can also be used to enhance policy integration by ensuring that cross-cutting issues are considered when financial resources are allocated (OECD, 2019 ). Policy integration in practice : in Ethiopia, the MoPD is responsible for integrating cross-cutting issues in federal and sector development plans. These include issues such as climate change, gender and disaster risk management, as well as global development frameworks like the SDGs [MoPD, WRI]. The latter are integrated into the monitoring framework of the cross-sectoral Climate Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) strategy. The 231 indicators of the SDG framework were taken as a basis to identify 68 indicators that are most relevant to the Ethiopian context. These are now used to track the CRGE strategy’s progress [MoFEC]. Greater integration of cross-cutting issues can also be observed within individual departments [GIZ1]. For example, the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Authority (EWCA) integrated economic and social issues in its environmental projects by focusing more on the socio-economic position of rural communities in the buffer zone of protected areas [GIZ2]. While EWCA used to mainly engage in awareness raising and law enforcement efforts to prevent rural communities from encroaching into its protected areas, the Authority now supports these communities by developing agroforestry livelihoods and engaging them in participatory land use planning [GIZ2]. Yet, it is indicated that the limited skills and knowledge of technical staff within the MoPD and at sector level hamper the quality of policy integration [MoPD].  3.4 Alignment through regulatory impact assessment A regulatory impact assessment is a procedure that facilitates governments to find the right approach to regulate societal challenges and align their policies with strategic objectives, such as the SDGs (OECD, 2021 ). By studying the expected economic, environmental and social impacts of a policy and by identifying who will likely benefit and who will bear the costs, a regulatory impact assessment can make synergies and inherent trade-offs transparent (Mbanda & Fourie, 2020; OECD, 2018, 2023 ). It supports the decision-making process by improving the information base on how a societal challenge can best be regulated, by identifying ways to govern trade-offs and by assessing if the anticipated benefits of a proposed regulation exceed the estimated costs (Nilsson & Weitz, 2019; OECD, 2012a, 2020 ). When the SDG framework is part of a regulatory impact assessment, it increases a government’s ability to design, implement and monitor policies that are aligned to Agenda 2030 (OECD, 2021 ). Impact assessment tools can be used at different stages of the policy cycle. For example, an assessment of a policy proposal can optimise policy response to a defined challenge while assessing the policy implementation process can identify possible regulatory misalignment and find paths to progress (Nilsson & Weitz, 2019; OECD, 2016 ). Assessments needs to be frequent enough to give policy-makers up-to-date regulatory performance information to learn, refine and re-prioritise policies and instruments when negative or unintended effects are observed (OECD, 2018, 2019 ). Regulatory Impact Assessment in practice : in Ethiopia, the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) under the MoPD has the mandate to oversee the integration of climate change and environmental regulations across sectors [EPA]. Before approving sector development projects, the MoPD requests the EPA to give an environmental and social safeguard clearance. This is provided based on an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment [EPA]. It is however indicated that in a country like Ethiopia it is not always possible to hinder economic growth due to environmental concerns. Hence, instead of requiring development projects to meet hard environmental criteria, the EPA currently issues clearances along with recommendations on how to reduce environmental impacts [EPA]. The follow-up given to these recommendations is however monitored and they are likely to be enforced in the future. Through its regulatory work, the EPA also manages the trade-offs between policy objectives related to economic growth and climate change mitigation. For example, the Authority conducts environmental audits of the Oromia and Amhara Forest Enterprises to check the tree cutting and replanting rates linked to timber production. In this way, it makes sure that forests that are counted as carbon sinks in the Nationally Determined Contribution and are meant for further climate change mitigation purposes are not being over-utilised as a result of logging activities [EPA].   4 Governance mechanisms for public-private alignment Since the late 1980s, public sector reforms have caused the national government to gradually become less central in solving societal challenges and steering society towards the achievement of public goods (Cairney, 2019; Gray & Purdy, 2018; Sørensen & Torfing, 2021 ). National governments tend to lack the required knowledge, expertise, technology and financial resources to meet sustainable development objectives, making collaborations needed that involve non-state actors, such as the private sector, civil society organisations and academia (Beisheim & Simon, 2018 ). We found two public–private alignment mechanisms that facilitate the achievement of public goals through private action. 4.1 Alignment through collaborative governance Collaborative governance can be defined as the processes and structures of public policy decision-making and management that constructively engage people across sector departments, levels of government and/or the public, private and civil spheres of society to fulfil a public purpose that could not have otherwise been accomplished (Emerson, Nabatchi, & Balogh, 2011; Sørensen & Torfing, 2021 ). To achieve the indivisible SDGs, public and private actors have to be included in collaborative governance processes that draw on the complementary competencies of each actor, pool their resources, and seek to accommodate their interests (Breuer et al., 2023; Glass & Newig, 2019; Stringer et al., 2014; Vazquez-Brust et al., 2020 ). Building integrated sustainable development visions requires broad societal consensus that can only be attained when a variety of societal groups are included and actively participate (Breuer et al., 2023 ). The learning that emanates from the inclusion of non-state actors in sustainable development processes increases the collective capacity to creatively solve complex problems, and improves the coherence, sustainability and effectiveness of outcomes by building trust, identifying shared interests and aligning differing problem and solution perceptions (Bianchi, Nasi, & Rivenbark, 2021; Glass & Newig, 2019; Shawoo et al., 2022; Sørensen & Torfing, 2021 ). Engaging the right actors and designing objectives collaboratively is essential for partnership effectiveness, just like managing implementation with adequate resources and time, and backing it with clear roles and responsibilities for each actor (Stafford-Smith et al., 2017 ). SDG implementation requires dialogue and engagement mechanisms through which governments can mobilise resources and deliver innovative solutions with non-state actors (OECD, 2018, 2023 ). For example, governments can create an enabling environment with policies and financial incentives to attract private investments and innovation into SDG-related policy domains (GPEDC, 2019; Sachs & Sachs, 2021; Zhan & Santos-Paulino, 2021 ). In addition to the potential benefits, collaborative governance also entails certain challenges and risks (Breuer et al., 2023; Sørensen & Torfing, 2021 ), for example related to motivating and building trust among actors, dealing with power asymmetries and implementing joint solutions. A general challenge when involving the private sector constitutes creating a regulatory framework that maximises its positive impacts while minimising the drawbacks of private investment in SDG-relevant policy domains (Zhan & Santos-Paulino, 2021 ). Some SDGs, such as education, have a public service character or are linked to essential infrastructure industries, such as water. This is where private sector involvement could have negative effects unless strong regulations and oversight are in place that guarantee affordable and accessible services that meet certain quality standards. Furthermore, private investments tend to be costly and risky when targeting vulnerable communities that are excluded from markets and employment opportunities, or when seeking to operate in contexts that are characterised by poor infrastructure, difficult access, weak governance and market failure. Development assistance could offset private sector risks in order to promote decent employment and economic inclusion (GPEDC, 2019 ). Collaborative governance in practice : realising that development assistance will not be sufficient for SDG attainment, the Ethiopian government and donors have shown interest to develop a national integrated financing framework to align public and private finance from both domestic and external sources, to finance economic, environmental and social objectives [UNDP2]. So far, MoFEC established a new Directorate General for public–private partnerships [MoFEC]. However, there is no clear regulation regarding public–private partnerships or integrated reporting yet, making it difficult to quantify the extent to which public goals are achieved through private action [MoFEC, UNDP1, UNDP2]. At the sector level, there is a move to boost public–private partnerships as part of donor-funded landscape restoration initiatives [UNDP1]. These partnerships are mainly aimed at creating forestry-related income-generating options for landless and unemployed youth groups and smallholder farmer cooperatives. For example, instead of maintaining government-owned tree nurseries efforts are now made to establish private (fruit) tree nurseries [EFD1, MoA]. To support their establishment, local governments train community groups on seed collection, seedling management, weeding, pruning and other silvicultural techniques, and supply agricultural input and small wood processing machines [SIDA, UNDP1]. In addition, community groups and cooperatives are linked to financial institutions and to the market for tree products [UNDP1]. Besides public–private partnerships that are oriented towards expanding private forestry cooperatives, there is also public–private partnership to expand the coverage of native trees and long-rotation trees. While farmers tend to grow eucalyptus trees because it gives revenue within a relatively short timeframe, there are now development projects – such as from the Austrian BFW – that encourage farmers to plant slow-growing native trees [EFD1]. When farmers plant at least 10 percent of their land with native trees and 15 percent with native or exotic long rotation trees, they receive an economic incentive. This incentive allows them to plant slow-growing native trees that yield good timber, such as Juniper, [EFD1]. The incentive approach has been taken up by other development actors as good practice. For example, GIZ introduced economic incentives for farmers who manage to obtain a minimum survival rate for their planted trees after 1.5 years, in order to motivate them to take care of their seedlings [GIZ2]. GIZ gives a higher payment for native trees that survive, than for exotic trees.  4.2 Alignment through integrated reporting While the private sector is expected to adopt more sustainable and responsible practices, tension still exists between short-term oriented business models that focus on financial returns and longer-term business models that also consider environmental, social and governance objectives (Bennich et al., 2020; GPEDC, 2019 ). In recent years, numerous international reporting initiatives have sought to increase the transparency and accountability of private investments and operations. Zhan and Santos-Paulino (2021)  stress the close link between the SDGs and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) reporting standards. SDG attainment requires moving away from voluntary environmental and social reporting towards integrated reporting standards that are broadly adopted by the private sector, and that foster investments and business operations that contribute to sustainable markets and societies. When integrated reporting makes the ways in which business activities impact individual SDGs more transparent, private actors may be incentivised to leverage their innovative power to create products and services that manage common trade-offs between SDGs (Breuer et al., 2019; GPEDC, 2019; Mbanda & Fourie, 2020; Stafford-Smith et al., 2017 ). Examples include profitable livelihoods that improve ecosystem functions, or socially-responsible companies that bring positive results to the communities in which they operate. Yet, creating reporting and accountability frameworks that stimulate the private sector to make deep environmental, social and governance transformations in their operations remains an unmet challenge (Sachs & Sachs, 2021 ). The abundance of frameworks that are not harmonised, mutually consistent or comprehensive has given rise to a lack of clarity on how private actors should align to the SDGs (Zhan & Santos-Paulino, 2021 ). So far, the wide range of SDGs and targets has allowed private actors to pick their preferred reporting criteria and ignore SDGs that are less convenient (Sachs & Sachs, 2021 ). Another challenge is getting small and medium enterprises, which make up a large part of economic activity in the global South, to comply with ESG reporting standards (Zhan & Santos-Paulino, 2021 ). Such enterprises often have limited reporting capacity and expertise. One solution could be to work closely with business associations that conduct joint ESG reporting on behalf of their members. National governments could work with such associations to fit their integrated reporting framework to the national context, while maintaining alignment to Agenda 2030. Integrated reporting in practice : no regulation related to integrated reporting currently exists in Ethiopia, causing it to not play a significant role in the forest and landscape restoration domain. Interviewees did not point out that integrated reporting of environmental, social and governance objectives plays a role to promote public goals through private action.   5 Governance mechanisms for donor-recipient alignment Since the 1990s, development cooperation initiatives have increasingly adopted programme-based approaches. These approaches have sought to strengthen recipient ownership by building domestic technical capacity and institutional sustainability that enable recipients to take effective leadership over their policies (Goldberg & Bryant, 2012; Orth, Schmitt, Krisch, & Oltsch, 2017 ). Programme-based approaches emerged following dissatisfaction with traditional, donor-driven development projects, which often resulted in the fragmentation and duplication of efforts, and high transaction costs for recipients who had to deal with a large diversity of donor priorities, funding models and implementation channels(Cassels, 1997; Dalil et al., 2014; De Maesschalck, Gagiano, Molenaers, Renard, & Verbeke, 2014; Peters, Paina, & Schleimann, 2013; Rogerson, 2005 ). We identified two programme-based approaches in development cooperation that seek to facilitate donor-recipient alignment. 5.1 Alignment by using budget support Through budget support, donors agree to channel development funds through a recipient’s financial management system to achieve medium and long-term policy objectives that are designed by the recipient (Chasukwa & Banik, 2019; Dijkstra, 2018 ). Budget support allows donor funds and national revenue streams to be pooled and administered by the recipient’s Ministry of Finance (Swedlund & Lierl, 2020 ). It is therefore considered the mechanism that most fully complies with aid effectiveness principles related to recipient ownership and donor-recipient alignment (Molenaers, 2012; Orth et al., 2017 ). Donors can also opt for a results-based approach where funds are disbursed once an agreed outcome is achieved; giving a recipient the autonomy to determine their own development path (Orth et al., 2017; Recio, 2022 ). Besides financial resources to facilitate policy implementation, budget support also comprises technical assistance and capacity development to support reform processes that increase the effectiveness and efficiency of financial resources (Goldberg & Bryant, 2012; Orth et al., 2017 ). The budget support mechanism is often accompanied by policy dialogue that enables donors to negotiate policy objectives, as well as technical and political reforms, and thus influence a larger share of resources than their own funds (Aubert, Brun, Agamile, & Treyer, 2018; Dijkstra, 2018; OECD, 2014; Swedlund & Lierl, 2020 ). A distinction can be made between general and sector budget support, which give donors access to different policy dialogues (Molenaers, 2012; OECD, 2003 ). General budget support gives access to the highest level of dialogue that deals with strategic and cross-cutting issues, such as all-encompassing public sector reforms and policy frameworks that foster integrated SDG implementation. Meanwhile, sector budget support gives access to dialogues that focus on policies of a specific sector, SDG or set of SDGs (Dijkstra, 2018 ). While many donors have withdrawn their budget support in recent years due to its alleged fiduciary and political risks, Orth and Schmitt (2018)  highlight a growing number of evaluations and synthesis studies that emphasize the positive effects of budget support and high-level policy dialogue as an integrated development approach to generate systemic impact. Budget support in practice : Rather than general budget support, donors in Ethiopia tend to provide earmarked grants to meet objectives within specific sectors [MoPD]. The Norway-funded REDD+Investment Programme is the largest sector budget support focused on forest conservation and restoration [Norad]. It comprises USD 100 million to reach the objectives of the National Forest Sector Development Programme, which seeks to promote sustainable forest management, tree planting and natural regeneration by building institutional structures and implementation frameworks at the federal, regional and district levels in seven Regional States. Norway transfers the funds to MoFEC and uses Ethiopia’s financial systems to implement the programme. Sweden joined Norway in funding the National Forest Sector Development Programme in 2017. Sweden however, does not provide budget support to the Ethiopian government, as it stopped this for political reasons following the human rights violations in the aftermath of the 2005 elections [Canada, SIDA]. This shows that although there is donor-recipient alignment with regard to policy objectives, there remains fragmentation when it comes to implementation channels. Other donors, particularly the United States and several European donors, have also halted their budget support to the Ethiopian government as a result of the 2022 armed conflict in Northern Ethiopia [EU, EPA, UNDP1, UNDP2]. Instead, some donors channel landscape restoration-related development assistance through CSOs and multilateral organisations. High-level policy dialogues with meaningful exchange between donors and the MoPD have been challenging, because the Ministry has been unwilling to share the results framework with specific indicators it uses to monitor progress on the national development plan [UNDP2]. Without precise information on what the government wants to achieve, and data on where each region and district currently stands, it is difficult for donors to align and focus their support on filling existing funding gaps to achieve development results [UNDP2]. It has also hampered donors to support the design of integrated policies that consider the synergies and trade-offs between economic, environmental and social development objectives. But with donors spending approximately USD 3.5 to USD 4 billion annually on development assistance, the MoPD has recently come to realise that it is in its best interest to share information and data with donors seeking to align their efforts with national priorities [UNDP2]. At the implementation level, several climate and environment-related donor-recipient dialogues are taking place, since this is where the main challenges exist [EU]. For example, the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Authority organises quarterly meetings with all its donors to give conservation project updates and synchronise implementation plans to optimise resource use and avoid duplication of efforts [GIZ2]. Nevertheless, the donor community remains very fragmented and donors tend to come with their own agenda and objectives to discuss with the Ethiopian government how they can support sector policies [EPA, GIZ2].  5.2 Alignment by using sector-wide approaches The sector-wide approach (SWAp) is a medium-term, overarching partnership between donors and a recipient that gives a central role to sector departments to create policies, instruments, and monitoring and expenditure frameworks that are sustained by a common management system (Cassels, 1997 ). As part of this approach, a strategic framework for institutional reform and capacity development is typically created for an entire sector, in close consultation with national and international partners (Ulikpan, Narula, Malik, & Hill, 2014 ). The process requires substantial political will and capacity from both recipient and donors, and a commitment to shared objectives (Aubert et al., 2018; Cassels, 1997; Goldberg & Bryant, 2012; Peters et al., 2013 ). Through a SWAp, recipients can align domestic and foreign resources, increase the transparency and predictability of aid allocation and harmonise donor conditionalities (Cassels, 1997; Rogerson, 2005 ). A coordinating actor can be appointed upon establishment to oversee implementation and ensure that future domestic revenue flows and development assistance are aligned with the SWAp (De Maesschalck, Gagiano, Molenaers, Renard, & Verbeke, 2014 ). Signing on to a SWAp means that donors relinquish their influence over project selection and implementation in exchange for participating in a broader policy dialogue and resource allocation process (Cassels, 1997 ). Because support is typically provided jointly by multiple donors, it is generally assumed that a SWAp fosters donor coordination and harmonised donor procedures (Orth et al., 2017 ), although empirical evidence is scarce (Leiderer, 2015 ). Lack of procurement and financial management capacity have been the main challenges in aligning donors with recipients’ national expenditure frameworks (Peters et al., 2013 ). Other challenges include involving all relevant sector actors and the emphasis on long-term institutional capacity building rather than just service delivery, making the SWAp an expensive mechanism for donors (OECD, 2003 ). SWAps also lead to more external scrutiny of public policies, which was previously the preserve of a national government (Cassels, 1997 ). Sector-wide approaches in practice : several sector-wide policy frameworks have guided donor-recipient relations in Ethiopia’s climate and environment domain. One example is the 2008 Ethiopian Strategic Investment Framework, through which the government is implementing its sustainable land management programme to reduce soil erosion and increase agricultural productivity [MoA, Canada]. Ethiopia’s government is using domestic revenues to finance the framework, while also linking it to a basket fund to which interested donors can contribute [WB]. Although there are multiple stand-alone projects, they all build on the same objectives, activities, and monitoring and reporting tools of the Investment Framework, and work through the same implementation unit within the MoA [Norad]. The only difference is that each donor finances its own districts, so that they can easily trace what is happening with their aid funds [WB, EU]. Since the framework was established, there has been a shift towards integrated landscape management, with a stronger emphasis on providing on– and off-farm livelihoods when implementing soil and water conservation measures [Canada, WB]. The MoA is now updating the framework to adopt a post-2024 basin perspective, rather than continuing its focus on micro-watersheds. It is expected that this will better facilitate creating synergies and managing trade-offs between agriculture, climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation objectives [WB, EU]. Biodiversity has so far not played a role in selecting watersheds for sustainable land management investments, but this is changing as some donors are interested in integrating biodiversity conservation into the framework and working with smallholder farmers in the buffer zone of protected areas [WB, MoA]. A second sector-wide policy framework is the National Forest Sector Development Programme, which was designed by the former Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) [Norad, UNDP1]. Its aim is to build the tree planting capacity of the forestry sector and attract skilled technical personnel at the federal, regional and district levels [Norad, UNDP1]. The framework was designed in 2014 with Norwegian support. Sweden, the European Union and World Bank joined later, expanding the number of districts with tree planting and assisted natural regeneration activities [UNDP1]. The framework has an economic component aimed at creating forestry businesses and catalysing GDP growth, as well as gender and environmental conservation components, integrating the three pillars of sustainable development. However, the frequent institutional reform of the forest sector has hindered donor efforts to strengthen the forestry sector [SIDA]. There are doubts about whether the current forestry agency (EFD) has sufficient ownership of the framework and is actively contacting donors to highlight which parts still need to be funded [SIDA]. Some donors that do not work with the federal government seek to integrate economic, environmental and social objectives as part of their integrated landscape management efforts with CSOs [SIDA, EU]. These efforts seek to bring environmental, agricultural and gender issues together with district-level needs, as is the case with the Sweden-funded Growth for Future project in the Central Rift Valley and the European Union-funded Bale Eco-Region Sustainable Management programme.   6 Governance mechanisms for inter-donor alignment Multilateral and bilateral donors can play a central role in SDG attainment by harmonising their development objectives, and aid allocation and disbursement conditionalities (Haas & Ivanovskis, 2022 ). Inter-donor alignment, or harmonisation, has been central to discussions about aid effectiveness since the adoption of the 2005 Paris Declaration (Sjöstedt & Sundström, 2017 ). Despite this attention however, how harmonisation efforts play out in practice has rarely been the subject of research. We identified two mechanisms that seek to create inter-donor alignment. 6.1 Alignment by using trust funds Pooled funding mechanisms, such as trust funds, have become increasingly popular among donors since the 2000 s. Trust funds harmonise the efforts of multiple donors by focusing on dedicated issues or locations (De Maesschalck, Gagiano, Molenaers, Renard, & Verbeke, 2014; Eichenauer & Knack, 2018; Reinsberg, Michaelowa, & Knack, 2017 ). A fund can be established on ad hoc  basis by donors with similar interests and terminated as they see fit, making trust funds a flexible but formal arrangement that can respond quickly to emerging interests and priorities. Trust funds are often hosted by multilateral organisations such as the World Bank or United Nations agencies, which administer the pooled funds and provide trustee services. Working through trust funds gives donors a degree of flexibility similar to bilateral development assistance, but without the need to maintain their own bureaucracy and with the ability to take advantage of the host organisation’s financial and implementation infrastructure (Eichenauer & Knack, 2018 ). The number of donors involved in a trust fund determines the extent to which individual donors can align the fund’s priorities with their own (Reinsberg et al., 2017 ). While a greater number of donors participating in a fund increases the benefits of burden-sharing, it also reduces the control each donor has over the direction of the trust fund in terms of issues and locations in which it operates. A notable alignment challenge is that trust funds may channel resources through a recipient government by creating dedicated Project Implementation Units that have their own objectives and implementation frameworks (De Maesschalck, Gagiano, Molenaers, Renard, & Verbeke, 2014 ). These units may act in isolation from other sector programmes (Ulikpan et al., 2014 ) and bring the risk of the recipient government being largely bypassed (Chasukwa & Banik, 2019; Peters et al., 2013 ). When trust funds integrate economic, environmental and social objectives, they are able to strengthen the integrated development paths required to implement the SDGs in an indivisible way. The literature offers little guidance however on how trust funds can consider SDG interactions and interdependencies. Trust funds in practice : multiple multi-donor trust funds focus on landscape restoration efforts in Ethiopia. The World Bank has supported the MoA’s Sustainable Land Management programme with various trust funds. For example, the Sustainable Land Management programmes (SLM1 and SLM2) were two consecutive five-year multi-donor trust funds that focused on reducing soil erosion and increasing agricultural productivity [Canada, WB]. Their successors are the Resilient Livelihoods and Landscapes programme (RLLP) and the Climate Action through Landscape Management programme (CALM), which are World Bank-funded and together cover approximately 5000 micro-watersheds. While the trust funds’ names changed over time to highlight different donor priorities, their activities have remained largely the same and focus on soil and water conservation measures and land administration [EU, WB]. However, RLLP and CALM have added livelihood diversification into their design, as many watersheds that have received a decade of sustainable land management investments can now support more agricultural livelihoods [WB]. Recently, the World Bank also created PROGREEN, an integrated trust fund that focuses on environmental conservation and restoration, forestry and agriculture [Norad, WB]. Both PROGREEN and RLLP focus on biodiversity conservation. For example, RLLP has completed the planning of 20 pilot sites where green corridors are created between existing forest remnants through tree planting and natural regeneration, to facilitate wildlife movement and increase landscape connectivity [WB]. UNDP manages another trust fund that supports Ethiopia’s National Forest Sector Development Programme. The underlying reason is that Sweden does not work directly with the federal government for political reasons and therefore channels its funding for the forestry sector through UNDP [SIDA]. Also the Norway-funded REDD Investment Programme is partly financed through a UNDP trust fund. The fund supports the government with procurement and the hiring of consultants to develop and implement certain programme components. World Bank and UNDP trust funds hire highly qualified technical personnel who are then seconded to the government, for example the MoA, EFD and the CRGE Facility. These employees receive better salaries than regular government employees, with the idea that this will retain them for the longer term and thus ensure more continuity [Canada, UNDP1, Norad]. For example, the Forest Sector Transformation Unit is a unit within EFD with highly qualified employees who are hired through UNDP [EFD2]. The unit fosters innovation in the forestry sector and creates transformative impact by introducing new technologies, equipment and training to improve seed quality, seedling planting and forestry entrepreneurship. It also focuses on designing inclusive, culturally sensitive and empowering restoration models to strengthen the work of sub-national forestry departments and with the idea that these models can be upscaled [EFD2].  6.2 Alignment by using donor working groups Alignment can become problematic when donors try to harmonise all their diverse interests into one unified process, usually centred around the creation of a single pooled fund. Such an all-encompassing approach may not be the most effective, nor the only way to achieve inter-donor alignment. Donors may prefer to maintain their own channels through which development assistance is delivered (Martinez-Alvarez et al., 2017 ). This may stem from the need to maintain control over funds and assure domestic constituencies that funds are being spent appropriately, to attribute results to funding a donor spends, and to generate more visibility for a single donor’s efforts (Chasukwa & Banik, 2019 ). The different interests and constraints of each donor can make it difficult to agree on common objectives and aid instruments (OECD, 2003 ). Even when donors prefer to follow their own objectives, instruments and implementing processes, they may still choose to coordinate the implementation process among themselves in donor working groups. Through these groups, donors can exchange project information to avoid duplication and the negative consequences of fragmentation. The groups can also help to build consensus and discipline among donors to focus on priority issues, lower transaction costs for recipients and foster the uptake of specific institutional and regulatory frameworks that have been successfully applied by one donor (OECD, 2003; Recio, 2022 ). Working groups can be created for different policy domains and tend to be chaired by a trusted lead donor who is in charge of facilitating exchange between the donor group and recipient government (OECD, 2003 ). Donor working groups in practice : the Development Partners Group (DPG) in Ethiopia includes 30 bilateral and multilateral donors and consists of multiple levels [UNDP2]. A high-level donor group brings together all heads of cooperation and heads of agencies to facilitate monthly political dialogue with the federal government [EU, SIDA, UNDP2]. This dialogue helps donors to understand the interests and priorities of the government and each other, and particularly focuses on existing policy gaps and proposed reforms to improve aid effectiveness [EU]. At the technical level, 18 working groups focus on sector priorities [UNDP2]. Landscape restoration-relevant groups include the Rural Economic Development and Food Security (RED&FS) Group and the Forest Group. The RED&FS Group convenes donors that fund the Ethiopian Strategic Investment Framework to discuss progress, raise sustainable land management-related concerns with the MoA and identify necessary action [Canada, CIFOR, EU]. For example, when it comes to land policy, all donors are vocal about the need to establish a neutral land use planning authority [WB]. Meanwhile, the Forest Group facilitates exchange between donors and the EFD to learn from each other’s forest conservation and restoration initiatives, improve overall forest governance approaches, create new project ideas and avoid implementing similar activities in the same districts [Norad, SIDA]. However, the working groups do not meet regularly and do not have a formally agreed working method and focus on results. Coordination has been challenging because there is no dedicated personnel to support long-term alignment between donors [Norad]. As a result, donors meet ad hoc and working groups operate in a fragmented manner, without horizontal and vertical communication [UNDP2]. UNDP-led discussions are now underway on how to improve synergy between the different levels of the Development Partners Group, with the aim of improving the quality of the policy dialogue among donors and between donors and the government to make development planning more inclusive [Norad, UNDP2]. Donor working groups also exist at the sub-national level. One example is the Lake Chamo Forum, which is an internal German development cooperation platform [GIZ1]. The Forum emerged from a biodiversity conservation project in Nech Sar National Park. Within that project it was observed that strong soil degradation in the upper catchment resulted in flooding and sedimentation of the lower catchment, which affected the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem of the National Park. The biodiversity project could not solve this challenge by itself, since it required interventions targeting the agricultural lands in the upper catchment. Therefore, was decided to start a variety of projects in the surrounding landscape [GIZ1]. This has led to a total of five German-funded projects being implemented in the Lake Chamo landscape to pursue different objectives, including biodiversity conservation, forest restoration, value chain creation for (agro)forestry products and land governance [GIZ1, GIZ2]. The Lake Chamo Forum helps the various projects to align their planning and implementation processes, and avoid duplication of efforts [GIZ1]. All projects share the same office to easily create synergy by exchanging ideas and exploiting the complementarity of their objectives [GIZ2].   7 Discussion and conclusion International and national development actors have struggled to deliver the integrated development approaches needed to achieve Agenda 2030 (Nilsson & Weitz, 2019 ). Breuer et al. (2023)  concluded that no single model or mechanism has empirically proven itself to be most effective in addressing SDG implementation challenges, although they did find that high-level political leadership, horizontal and vertical alignment and societal inclusiveness are important factors for success. In the absence of a first best solution or framework for SDG achievement, combining a variety of existing and new alignment mechanisms and entry points may be the most effective way to foster integrated development approaches. Through this literature review, we advance our understanding of how existing mechanisms in the public governance and international development field can align multiple actors and facilitate the balancing of economic, environmental and social priorities. We conclude that the extant literature offers a diversity of governance mechanisms that enable development actors across sectors, levels and jurisdictions to transcend their policy silos and align their development priorities. We identified ten multi-actor alignment mechanisms with the potential to address SDG interactions by fostering integrated development approaches and policy coherence. These are Centre of Government efforts, inter-departmental collaboration, policy integration, regulatory impact assessment, collaborative governance, integrated reporting, budget support, sector-wide approaches, trust funds and donor working groups. While Browne et al. (2023)  found a positive link between policy coherence and policy effectiveness, they did not find evidence for a positive link between policy coherence and reduced inequality. This suggests that the identified alignment mechanisms have the potential to implement the SDGs more effectively, but also that further efforts are required to address multidimensional inequalities. Achieving the objective of “leaving no one behind” necessitates political will and risk-taking to actively address international and domestic inequalities across a wide range of policy domains and governance levels (Ahlström & Sjåfjell, 2023; Pouw et al., 2020 ). Our contribution builds on, and goes further than what the OECD has offered to date, and has broad relevance for development actors in the global North and South who are looking for different mechanisms to strengthen the governance of SDG interactions. Our approach is in line with the call from the policy coherence literature to not underestimate the political dimension, to consider the entire policy cycle and to pay particular attention to the implementation stage in the case of intersectoral complex policies (Righettini & Lizzi, 2022 ). Taken together, the ten alignment mechanisms promote the integration of policy ideas (e.g. policy integration or sector-wide approaches), negotiation of conflicting interests (e.g. inter-departmental collaboration or collaborative governance), and above all the creation of new institutional mechanisms at crucial points in the multi-level and multi-sector governance system (Croese, Oloko, Simon, & Valencia, 2021; Patay et al., 2023; Shawoo et al., 2022 ). The set of identified alignment mechanisms is comprehensive but likely not complete, given that our analysis is based on mechanisms documented in the research literature. Empirical research into SDG governance could uncover other alignment mechanisms, provide more insights into their potential to address SDG synergies and trade-offs, as well as insights into their contribution to inclusive and effective SDG implementation. With the exception of integrated reporting, we found concrete examples of how the ten alignment mechanisms are used in practice within Ethiopia’s forest and landscape restoration domain and how they seek to integrate sustainable development’s different dimensions. Yet, it is difficult to understand how exactly SDG interactions can be addressed through these alignment mechanisms, as the SDGs are taken into account implicitly rather than explicitly in most development efforts in Ethiopia. Interviewees found it easier to reflect on how economic, environmental and social dimensions are integrated into development efforts, than on how specific SDGs are included. The interview results show that a number of new alignment mechanisms have been established in Ethiopia and that there is a general move towards more integrated approaches to forest and landscape restoration. While in the past, landscape restoration efforts would more narrowly focus on one set of objectives, like soil and water conservation and agricultural productivity, there is growing attention for other dimensions, such as the economic and social position of vulnerable groups in rural communities and biodiversity conservation. Notable new mechanisms at the federal level are the MoFEC’s Special Fund for the Green Legacy and Landscape Restoration and the National Forest Landscape Restoration Platform that both seek to align the restoration efforts of the agriculture, forestry and water sectors. Meanwhile, at the local level, public landscape governance platforms such as the Southwest Forest Alliance have emerged. Through public–private partnerships, the Ethiopian government and donors are improving the livelihood and biodiversity benefits of landscape restoration, by targeting landless and unemployed youth groups to establish tree nurseries and by delivering financial incentives to farmers to plant native and long-rotation trees. A new generation of trust funds and sector-wide approaches is now placing greater focus on livelihood diversification, gender issues and biodiversity conservation than past initiatives. When it comes to donor working groups, the Lake Chamo Forum shows that such groups can create synergy between a variety of initiatives to pursue biodiversity conservation, forest restoration, value chain development and land governance efforts in a mutually reinforcing way. The interviews show that landscape restoration efforts are increasingly designed in ways that balance sustainable development’s economic, environmental and social dimensions. Still, important alignment mechanisms to create synergies and negotiate trade-offs between policy objectives are missing, such as a strong, neutral land use planning authority. In other cases, actors face difficulties in aligning their efforts and promote integrated development approaches. For example, a number of donors is not giving budget support to the Ethiopian government as a result of human rights concerns. At the same time, the MoDP has long been unwilling to share the indicator framework it uses to monitor progress on the national development plan, which prevents donors from focusing their budgets on the issues that need it most. Alignment can occur at different stages of the policy cycle, between policy ideas and frames, policy objectives, policy instruments and during the policy implementation process (Wiegant et al., 2023 ). While aligning policy frames can help bring the world views of different development actors closer together and enable agreement on the most pressing problems and the most appropriate solutions, aligning policy objectives can make the synergies and trade-offs between the objectives of different sectors more transparent. Aligning policy instruments can ensure that the instruments of different sectors, such as regulatory frameworks, financial incentives or awareness campaigns, do not contradict each other, while alignment during the implementation process can prevent fragmentation and duplication of efforts on the ground. In Table 1   we situate the identified alignment mechanisms at different stages of the policy cycle. To better understand the influence that the ten alignment mechanisms play in governance approaches for dealing with SDG interactions, more research is needed on their role in facilitating consistency and synergies, and negotiating trade-offs during different phases of the policy cycle (Righettini & Lizzi, 2022 ). From bringing together different policy frames and objectives, to balancing economic, environmental and social development priorities, and subsequently implementing integrated development efforts (Sørensen & Torfing, 2021 ). As mentioned, implementing the SDGs in an indivisible way is not only a coordination challenge but a political undertaking, which is subject to the interests and ideas of those who benefit from policy (in)coherence (Brand et al., 2021; Shawoo et al., 2022 ). The ‘politics of policy coherence’ influence the ability of the ten alignment mechanisms to govern the creation of synergies and negotiation of trade-offs among sustainable development’s different dimensions, and hence to attain the SDGs. This means that the generalisability of studies in this field, including our study of Ethiopia, is limited by their specific political context. Future research needs to be aware of, and further consider the influence of ideas, institutions and interests, and associated power dynamics, when studying the mechanisms that seek to align different policy domains. Nevertheless, the presence of concrete alignment mechanisms in Ethiopia confirms that real efforts are made to better integrate sustainable development’s different dimensions. The identified mechanisms exist at different places in the ‘development actor landscape’, meaning that integrated development approaches can be promoted at different places in the governance system, even when progress in other places is minimal.
