                  The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agreed upon by the United Nations (UN) in 2015 encompass a set of 17 Goals, aimed at integrating matters of humanity’s most pressing problems. Although the SDGs were initially suggested to be carried out by governments, enterprises are key players for the achievement of these goals through their business activities. Among for-profit firms, Certified B Corporations (B Corps) are a legal form of hybrid organizations (HOs) that has received scarce attention in the literature. Building on business model and corporate social innovation (CSI) literature, this paper aims to identify to what extent and how B Corps contribute to the SDGs when focusing on the solution of renowned social problems highlighted by the UN. A multiple-case study based on in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 18 enterprises in an emerging economy in Latin America (Colombia), shows that B Corps are great contributors to the solution of social problems, such as agriculture-related challenges, corruption, climate change, labor, poverty, and unsustainable habits. Results elucidate that Colombian B Corps show great potential in the empowerment of communities, the introduction of novel organizational practices, the creation of alternatives that shape new lifestyles and consumption patterns, and the introduction of novel environmental solutions. Overall, Colombian B Corps show relevant contributions to Goals 2, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 16. Finally, this research provides a model for analyzing CSI in HOs and gives avenues for future research.

Handling editor: Yutao Wang The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agreed upon by the United Nations (UN) in 2015 encompass a set of 17 Goals, aimed at integrating matters of humanity’s most pressing problems. Although the SDGs were initially suggested to be carried out by governments, enterprises are key players for the achievement of these goals through their business activities. Among for-profit firms, Certified B Corporations (B Corps) are a legal form of hybrid organizations (HOs) that has received scarce attention in the literature. Building on business model and corporate social innovation (CSI) literature, this paper aims to identify to what extent and how B Corps contribute to the SDGs when focusing on the solution of renowned social problems highlighted by the UN. A multiple-case study based on in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 18 enterprises in an emerging economy in Latin America (Colombia), shows that B Corps are great contributors to the solution of social problems, such as agriculture-related challenges, corruption, climate change, labor, poverty, and unsustainable habits. Results elucidate that Colombian B Corps show great potential in the empowerment of communities, the introduction of novel organizational practices, the creation of alternatives that shape new lifestyles and consumption patterns, and the introduction of novel environmental solutions. Overall, Colombian B Corps show relevant contributions to Goals 2, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 16. Finally, this research provides a model for analyzing CSI in HOs and gives avenues for future research.   Keywords Sustainable development goals  Case study  B Corp  Hybrid organization  Corporate social innovation  Sustainable development    1 Introduction Businesses are meeting increasing demands to alleviate social and environmental issues (Santos et al., 2015 ). Driven by social and ecological trends and rapidly changing environments, enterprises have been increasing their implications in sustainable development (SD) (Engert et al., 2016 ). SD arose as the result of a growing global awareness of environmental, economic, and social issues, as matters compromising the future of humanity (Hopwood et al., 2005 ). SD was globally disclosed in 1987 in the United Nations (UN) World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) and defined in the Brundtland Report as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (WCED, 1987 , p. 43). Regarding SD as an urgent matter for humanity, in 2015, the UN adopted a global action plan of desired SD outcomes schemed under a set of 17 interrelated goals, better known as Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (United Nations General Assembly, 2015 ). The SDGs include humankind’s most pressing problems as a target to be reached by implementing sustainable approaches (Fig. 1  ). Although the SDGs correspond to a global SD agenda of governance aiming to face global challenges regarding environmental, social, and economic issues, they are not exclusive for governments, and businesses are playing a relevant role in attaining these goals (van der Waal and Thijssens, 2020 ). Specifically, the UN pointed out: “We call upon all businesses to apply their creativity and innovation to solving sustainable development challenges” (United Nations General Assembly, 2015 , p. 25). Regarding the role of businesses in society, novel business models, such as hybrid organizations (HOs), are emerging as a type of firm focused on the mitigation of social and environmental issues (Santos et al., 2015 ). HOs have also been labeled as social purpose organizations (SPOs) (Moroz and Gamble, 2020 ) or social enterprises (SEs) (Olofsson et al., 2018 ) as organizations that incorporate aspects of charity and business forms at their core (Battilana and Lee, 2014 ). Among HOs, Certified B Corporations (B Corps) are for-profit legal forms focused on creating well-being and characterized by a mission that embeds social and environmental purposes (Stubbs, 2017 ). Scholars have been developing acute efforts on elucidating the role that enterprises play on achieving the SDGs (Ike et al., 2019 ; van der Waal and Thijssens, 2020 ); however, among firms, HOs have gained attention for being significant contributors to this agenda (Rahdari et al., 2016 ). To illustrate, Horne et al. (2020)  highlighted how social entrepreneurship contributes to activities of the national context in Germany by fulfilling specific SDGs; Castellas and Ormiston (2018)  uncovered that SDGs can provide a coherent frame for impact investment, since SDGs provide a business frame for analyzing the impact strategies of investors in SEs. As well, studies give evidence that HOs are great promoters of social well-being when pursuing SDGs in areas such as systemic change (Bretos et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, research in HOs and SDGs is still scarce, and there is a research gap from the perspective of legal HOs such as B Corps. Following the UNs call to drive SD issues around vulnerable regions in the world, Latin America is an example of a region characterized by structural problems and social disparities. Particularly, Colombia is the third country in Latin America to become an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member in April 2020 (OECD, 2020 ). However, the country faces multiple challenges since its economy is characterized by low labor productivity, high economic informality, weak vocational education, weak training systems, and growing poverty (OECD, 2019 ). Regarding SDGs, Colombia ranks 67th in the worldwide index to accomplish such objectives, with major challenges in Goals 10  and 16  (Fig. 1 ) (United Nations, 2019 ). Considering scant studies on B Corps (Stubbs, 2017 ) and the lack of evidence on how HOs engage the SDG agenda (Günzel-Jensen et al., 2020 ), the state of the literature in this area opens a span for research opportunities. As well, the scarcity of studies in Latin America suggests that more research is needed, and scholars point out that further evidence on the implementation of the SDGs in developing countries is expected (Salvia et al., 2019 ). To fulfill this absence of empirical evidence, this paper focuses on two research questions: RQ1. To what extent (and how) do B Corps contribute to the SDGs?  RQ2. How can we map SDG-related activities with B Corps in Colombia?  Based on a multiple-case study, this research aims to deliver a unique contribution by providing evidence on the role that B Corps play in the SDGs in an emerging economy in Latin America. To analyze this unexplored relationship in literature, this paper links HOs literature (Haigh and Hoffman, 2012 ; Stubbs, 2017 ) and considers the opportunity framework of corporate social innovation (CSI) for the alleviation of social problems (SPs) (Baltazar-Herrera, 2015 ; Varadarajan and Kaul, 2018 ). The article is structured as follows. After the introduction, Section 2  presents the literature review and the theoretical underpinnings of this research. Section 3  describes the research process and method. Section 4  summarizes and discusses research results. Lastly, Section 5  presents conclusions and avenues for future research.  2 Theoretical background 2.1 B Corps: A legal hybrid form HOs are non-traditional firms, since they are organizations pursuing a social mission while capturing value for both owners and society (Santos et al., 2015 ). HOs combine multiple organizational forms, including for-profit and nonprofit realms (Battilana and Lee, 2014 ), and design their business models based on the alleviation of specific SPs on social and/or environmental issues (Haigh et al., 2015 ). Of particular interest in this research are the legal forms of HOs, the so-called B Corps. B Corps are firms legally and voluntarily committed to social and/or environmental purposes through business activities. B Corps consist of a certification developed by B Lab, a nonprofit organization founded in the United States in 2006, seeking to use business as a force for good (B Lab, 2020 ). B Corps entail characteristics of corporations while ought to generate sustainable solutions in social, economic, and environmental issues as part of their mission (Harjoto et al., 2019 ). The B Corp certification requires the firm’s legal commitment to guarantee that the business purpose will maintain unchanged thought time (Hickman et al., 2014 ). Qualifying for the B Corp Certification requires a minimum of 80 points in a procedure called Benefit Impact Assessment (BIA), which assesses five impact areas – Workers, Governance, Community, Environment, and Customers (B Lab, 2020 ). B Corps aim to create positive social impacts for the planet and internalize aspects of their social context through business leadership and sustainability to foster social change (Stubbs, 2017 ). Moreover, B Corp’s impact on SD issues requires further research. 2.1.1 SDGs: insights from HOs Given the recent emergence of the SDGs in the business scene, research on the phenomenon is still scant and diffused (van der Waal and Thijssens, 2020 ). Considering that HOs differ from traditional firms since they combine divergent organizational dynamics, there is growing evidence on their implications in the SDGs. Indeed, recent research in SDGs has been interpreting the role of SEs on issues such as social and solidarity economy (Quiroz-Niño and Murga-Menoyo, 2017 ), gender equality and women’s empowerment (Doherty, 2018 ), and other societal grand challenges (Günzel-Jensen et al., 2020 ). As well, scholars have proven that SEs develop SD practices in the value chain that can be adopted to meet SDGs (Littlewood and Holt, 2018 ; Wang et al., 2020 ). There is also evidence that HOs play a relevant role in achieving the SDGs in domestic issues; to illustrate, Horne et al. (2020)  determined that social entrepreneurs in Germany show great engagement with Goals 3, 9 , and 12 ; while Conway et al. (2019)  illustrated that SEs in Zimbabwe are capable of scaling solutions in the energy sector and to achieve Goal 7 . There is crescent research suggesting that innovation is a suitable framework to analyze HOs’ contributions to SDGs. For instance, Lehoux et al. (2018)  explored SDGs from the perspective of responsible innovation in health by combining entrepreneurship and innovation literature. Based on the innovation-network theory, Lawson-Lartego and Mathiassen (2020)  examined the value co-creation process in microfranchising of SEs in Bangladesh as instruments to alleviate poverty and hunger, contributing to Goals 1  and 2 ; while Rahdari et al. (2016)  used Schumpeter’s perspective for highlighting SEs engagement in the SDGs. Overall, studies suggest that HOs are great contributors to the SDGs by targeting specific Goals by means of business activities focused on the solution of SPs. Some studies have indicated that SDGs can be addressed through social innovation (SI) (Bansal et al., 2019 ; Eichler and Schwarz, 2019 ; Rao Ambati, 2019 ), while further research on this issue is encouraged (Eichler and Schwarz, 2019 ; Tabares, 2020 ). This opportunity framework is centrally explored in this research.   2.2 CSI and HOs SI is a cross-disciplinary domain that focuses on addressing social needs through new products and services, a reason it has become a relevant tool to provide solutions to the most complex problems facing humanity (Dawson and Daniel, 2010 ). From a sociological approach, SI is defined as a “novel solution to a social problem that is more effective, efficient, sustainable, or just than existing solutions and for which the value created accrues primarily to society” (Phills, 2009 , p. 39). Regarding the role of business in the social dimension of innovation, the sociological stream of SI research resonates with the HOs framework (Candi et al., 2019 ). CSI is a research line of SI, which is focused on for-profit firms whose objective is to achieve economic benefits while creating social impacts (Kanter, 1999 ). CSI consists of an alternative for firms that sees complex social issues as business opportunities (Baltazar-Herrera, 2015 ). Also named Doing Well by Doing Good  (DWDG) innovations, CSI is defined as “the implementation by a firm of a new product, process or practice, or a modification of an existing product, process or practice that benefits society by aiding in the alleviation of a social problem, and benefits the firm” (Varadarajan and Kaul, 2018 , p. 226). In this view, SPs are objective conditions perceived by a large public as undesirable in that they require action for their transformation, and which risks the well-being and the quality of life of a substantial number of people (Lauer, 1976 ). Following Lauer (1976) , each society defines and characterizes SPs according to its context and needs. According to Varadarajan and Kaul (2018) , CSI includes different business areas: a) novel products/services that will do well in the marketplace, b) social impacts created from commercial transactions, c) sustainable-oriented innovations (novel ideas, products, and/or services centered on environmental issues that to do well in society), d) novel ideas that alleviate needs from the external environment (e.g., regulations that prohibit certain practices or unstainable consumption behaviors), e) innovations based on a firm’s internal environment (e.g., the engagement of disabled employees), and, f) the alleviation of problems for customers at the bottom-of-the-pyramid  (BOP). Certainly, HOs are, in essence, innovative firms (Padgett and Powell, 2012 ), and evidence supports the fact that they are increasingly regarded as a source of social value creation and SI (Candi et al., 2019 ; Rao-Nicholson et al., 2017 ). Specifically, research highlights significant results in emerging and underdeveloped economies (Vassallo et al., 2019 ), where CSI is likely to reach greater potential (Varadarajan and Kaul, 2018 ). According to Varadarajan and Kaul (2018) , a wide range of business activities that can be considered as CSIs have not been sufficiently explored in the literature. This research explores the opportunity framework referred to as “innovations for bridging gaps related to other social problems, ” which refers to SPs highlighted by the UN (Varadarajan and Kaul, 2018 , p. 229).  2.3 Analytical framework This paper analyzes how Colombian B Corps contribute to the SDGs by identifying the SPs that they are able to develop via CSI. As there is no broad schema in the literature, this paper suggests an analytical framework to interpret this phenomenon (Fig. 2  ). For such analysis, this study takes into consideration two elements. First, although CSI was aimed to be applied in traditional firms, this approach will be the starting point to identify how B Corps provide solutions to renowned SPs while pursuing social value through commercial realms. CSI is developed through the institutionalization of practices characterized by a) strategic alignment, b) the embedment of institutional elements, and c) a focus on specific areas (Baltazar-Herrera, 2015 ). Although this study does not intend to test Baltazar-Herrera (2015)  model, her research helps to identify CSIs by providing insights that are compatible with HOs. Second, HOs encompass certain particularities which differentiate from traditional firms: a) HOs’ objective is to drive positive environmental/social change, b) they create reciprocally beneficial relations with stakeholders, and c) they interact progressively with competitors, markets, and industry institutions (Haigh and Hoffman, 2012 ). As this research focuses on HOs, concepts such as hybrid business models (Haigh and Hoffman, 2012 ) and the B Corp model (Stubbs, 2017 ) must be considered since they allow understanding B Corps singularities. Specifically, Stubbs (2017)  proposes a framework that analyses B Corps that echo with hybrid business models and includes four elements: a) a dominant objective, b) success measurement, c) stakeholders, and d) influence in SD. Considering that both frameworks are complementary and resonate, Table 1   summarizes the elements considered to understand how B Corps contribute to the SDGs by examining the SPs that they address through CSI. It includes the two previously related theoretical underpinnings (column 1 ), the aspects highlighted in the literature (column 2 ), and the elements that structure the analytical framework of this research (column 3 ).   3 Research methods Given a lack of empirical research, this paper adopts an exploratory qualitative approach aiming to observe a phenomenon little examined in the literature (Edmondson and Mcmanus, 2007 ). This study uses an inductive strategy starting with data collection, followed by data analysis, and then it develops a generalization of the analyzed phenomena (Eisenhardt, 1989 ). This research is built on a multiple-case-study approach since it is an appropriate methodology to study social phenomena in real-life contexts that involves explanations from context causal relations (Yin, 2013 ). Although case studies are not representative samples of an existing population, multiple-case studies encourage more data profundity instead of focusing on one case and allows an increase of construct validity while reducing bias (Gibbert et al., 2008 ). 3.1 Data collection Sampling was derived from three criteria: (1) enterprises that contribute to the alleviation of SPs as part of their core business; (2) firms committed to creating both social and economic value; and, (3) enterprises integrating sustainability-associated activities. Considering that B Corps fit these criteria, firms were identified from a public B Lab database (Data World, 2020 ) through a purposive sampling technique. Purposeful sampling methods allow creating a consistent sample that provides in-depth comprehension of a phenomenon (Denzin and Lincoln, 2005 ). B Corps were contacted via email and successively followed up with phone calls to confirm the criteria. Eighteen (18) B Corps participated in the research. Table 2   summarizes the firms’ description classified by codes, industry groups, and size. Data was collected between October 2019 and August 2020. In-depth semi-structured interviews were chosen as the primary data-collection method. Considering that organizational informants are a common data-collection method to support exploratory research (Aguinis and Solarino, 2019 ), interviews were developed with B Corps’ founders and senior managers. Interviews were carried out face-to-face at the company installations or – when not possible – by telephone. Interviews ran from between 45 and 90 min, with 43 individuals interviewed. Interviews were recorded (with consent) and transcribed in order to provide replicability and transparency during the research process. The interviews included questions on each firm’s background; interviewee’s background; description of the SPs that they solve; enterprise definitions of SI and SD; business practices/processes to achieve social/environmental goals; tools to measure social/environmental goals; description of the enterprise stakeholders, alliances, and collaborations; description of the enterprises before and after the B Corp certification; relationship with SDGs; and measurements/indicators linked to SDGs. Secondary data was collected from enterprise websites, business reports, B Corp websites, social media, firms’ indicators, and on-site observations.  3.2 Data analysis Following Eisenhardt (1989) , data analysis was developed through three steps. First – and considering the large volume of information – a within-case analysis was developed in order to become familiarized with the cases as single entities. This process allowed the emergence of unique patterns of each case before pushing to generalization patterns. To maintain a chain of custody for understanding the data, a case study database was developed (Yin, 2013 ). The database included a document with the interview transcripts, interview impressions, and firm documents. Interviews were transcribed and entered into Atlas.ti 8, a computer-assisted qualitative data-analysis software to assist the analysis process (Hwang, 2008 ). Second, through pattern matching, information was classified into categories leading to within-group similarities and subsequently coupled with intergroup dissimilarities (Eisenhardt, 1989 ). Third, primary and secondary information was triangulated in order to provide a reliability and validity construct to the multiple-case study (Gibbert et al., 2008 ), as well as verifying findings from multiple perspectives (Yin, 2013 ). Two empirically observed emerging patterns became apparent: First, building on Varadarajan and Kaul (2018) , CSI was identified in each enterprise and classified into categories regarding how they create novel solutions to SPs in Colombia. Considering that each society defines SPs according to their context (Lauer, 1976 ), there is no unequivocal index for categorizing them; thus, nine categories emerged from an inductive analysis: (a) agriculture-related challenges, (b) corruption, (c) climate change, (d) illiteracy/lack of education, (e) labor-related issues, (f) lack of community involvement, (g) malnutrition, (h) poverty/inequalities, and (i) unsustainable habits/lifestyles. Second, to verify that the identified SPs contribute to the SDGs, the targets and indicators of each SDG (United Nations General Assembly, 2015 ) were contrasted with the evidence provided by each firm. Respondents personally scanned and pointed out the business contributions to the SDGs through supporting figures, measurement tools, and narratives correlated with the SDGs’ targets and indicators. SP categories resulting from CSI were graphed utilizing a mental mapping technique similar to Ike et al. (2019)  and Dos Santos et al. (2019) , as not all the identified SPs had a one-to-one correlation with SDGs. Mapping helps understand which SDGs are addressed and unaddressed in correlation with the type of SPs that B Corps solve. Moreover, mapping in this research can only indicate a potential correlation on how B Corps contribute to the SDGs, but it is not enough evidence for causation (it would require further assessment, which is out of scope for this qualitative research approach). This is because some firms do not have the capacity to measure all the impacts related to their business activities (e.g., enterprises #F and #Q stressed that they cannot measure the impact of their products/services in people’s health, but they can measure other tangible aspects, such as CO2  emissions).   4 Findings and discussion In order to examine how the CSI lenses help to understand B Corps contribution to the SDGs, results are presented by following the analytical framework previously summarized in Table 1 . This section discusses two categories: (a) CSI in B Corps (Section 4.1 ) and (b) B Corps contribution to the SDGs (Section 4.2 ). 4.1 B Corps and CSI B Corps entail an enormous potential for contributing to the SDGs by analyzing the SPs they aim to solve via CSI. CSI in B Corps is, in essence, a result of the development of novel products/services and processes, as well as internal procedures focused on the well-being of multiple stakeholders. First, because B Corps develop a business philosophy that uses the power of business to create changes in society, and second, because such firms have the potential to develop the type of CSIs that commercial firms are able to carry out. 4.1.1 A new philosophy of doing business Colombian B Corps harness SPs according to the needs of the business context shaped by both internal motivations and environmental challenges. On the one hand, B Corps involve solid values and a clear mission towards the alleviation of SPs; hence, the development of CSIs is aligned with B Corps core business, which becomes an organic and symbiotic feature of their performance. On the other hand, unmet needs in the Colombian society have a relevant influence on B Corps’ mission since the creation of social/environmental impacts shapes their business model. Mainly, B Corps are willing to modify their cost structure to balance their purpose-oriented mission and the expected profits. Additionally, B Corps are expected to follow B Lab guidelines, which influences several aspects of a firm’s decisions. For instance, since November 2019, B Corps are committed to reaching carbon neutrality by 2030 after participating in the UN Climate Conference (COP25). Likewise, B Corps are compelled to condemn any act of corruption when doing business and are encouraged to focus on key issues: Workers, Governance, Community, Environment, and Customers. These elements influence B Corps to adopt innovative strategies not only in the creation of products/services but also in the creation of new organizational practices.  4.1.2 CSI in B Corps B Corps have the potential to contribute to diverse domestic SPs of the Colombian society through their core business activities. In line with Varadarajan and Kaul (2018) , B Corps conduct different activities that can be classified as CSIs (Fig. 3  ). Markedly, three categories stand out. Firstly, B Corps focus on new products/services that do well in the marketplace by offering a wide range of alternatives that provide solutions to unsustainable habits in society. Predominantly, B Corps gave evidence on: products/services that improve eating habits by offering healthier alternatives of nutrition (#D, #F, #G, #O); services that promote new lifestyles in housing (#B, #C), consuming patterns (#N), or mobility (#Q); alternatives that motivate ecological behaviors for consumers (#H, #I, #K), or methodologies and consulting services that stimulate empowering behaviors (#A, #J, #K, #L, #M). This type of CSI was linked to the adjustment of social behaviors and the creation of novel habits. Secondly, B Corps are highly prone to creating sustainable-oriented innovations that give an answer to SPs related to climate change or agriculture. Regarding B Corps’ commitment to carbon neutrality, all the enterprises required the implementation of novel organizational practices to achieve this goal. CSIs were related to aspects such as novel construction practices (#B, #C), solutions that reduce environmental waste (#B, #C), processes that reduce environmental resources in the supply chain (#D, #E, #G), sustainable practices in agriculture (#D, #E, #F, #G, #H), collaborative production systems (#E, #F), and environmental solutions that benefit society in mobility, air quality, or eco-practices (#G, #H, #I, #K, #N). Thirdly, firms showed evidence of CSI from the firm’s internal environment that give solutions to SPs related to labor issues, illiteracy, corruption, or a lack of community involvement. The implementation of novel practices and policies focused on employee’s well-being (#C, #P, #R), or the creation of inclusive hiring practices that generate inclusion of people with disabilities, high rates of illiteracy, or people traditionally excluded in labor-related issues (#A, #B, #D, #E, #F, #G, #N, #P) were notable examples. As well, different firms presented collaborations in the creation of relationships with local communities and vulnerable populations (e.g., enterprises #F and #G work with populations affected by the armed conflict in Colombia, while enterprises #I, #J, #L focus on communities in low-income regions in Colombia). These examples of CSIs were characterized by community empowerment and the development of skills and training. Finally, a lower number of activities were derived from economic transactions (#C, #M, #O), compliance with environmental standards (#N), or products/services focused on BOP customers that provide solutions to issues of malnutrition and poverty (#H, #J, #L, #N, #R). Despite CSIs variate from firm-to-firm (depending on the firm’s industry or size), B Corps show a high involvement in CSI issues in their core business activities. Overall, B Corp business activities present compelling potential to offer direct or indirect solutions to domestic SPs in Colombia.   4.2 Solving domestic SPs: SDGs mapping To illustrate how B Corps contribute to different SPs through their core business activities, Fig. 4   summarizes the identified SPs categories and their description in relation to each enterprise. Bearing in mind that some SPs are interrelated and can be analyzed from different perspectives, SPs were classified according to the focus and scope of each firm (e.g., even if the ‘loss of soil quality’ is an environmental problem, it is considered as an agriculture-related challenge for a concrete group of firms). Once the SPs that B Corps address via CSI were identified, it was then possible to recognize whether they were related to a single or multiple SDGs, and to map this relationship. It is relevant to highlight that not all the enterprises focus on the SDGs as a business strategy, and only seven enterprises declare them in their mission (#D, #E, #I, #K, #L, #N, #R). Although B Lab does not focus on providing tools to achieve the SDGs, some of the B Corp practices are closely related to them as previously mentioned. Regarding the results of this research, B Corps contribute to multiple SDGs. Since manifold domestic Colombian SPs are related to agriculture, B Corps attend Goal 1: No Poverty , by focusing on Target 1.3  on providing farmers social-protection systems and floors (#E, #D, #F, #G). Enterprises target SPs associated to Goal 2: Zero Hunger , linked to the food-production system in agriculture by promoting Target 2.3  on improving small-scale food producers’ income; Target 2.4  on encouraging sustainable food-production systems; Target 2.5  on maintaining genetic seed diversity; and Target 2.A  on attracting investment to enhance the country’s agricultural productive capacity. These goals are connected to Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities , particularly with Target 10.2  on economic inclusion, reflected in the generation of opportunities for a low-income population (#R), the creation of inclusive practices (#A, #B, #C, #N, #P), or the implementation of collaborations and alliances with various institutions aiming to benefit vulnerable populations (#D, #E, #F, #G, #J, #M, #L, #P). Regarding the absence of a solid education system and a lack of training opportunities, B Corps present relevant contributions to training and education issues. They contribute to Goal 4: Quality Education , Target 4.3  on affording technical and vocational training (#L, #P); Target 4.4  on creating decent jobs, entrepreneurship, and increasing skills (#J, #L, #H); Target 4.5  on promoting vulnerable-population vocational training (#F, #P); Target 4.7  on constructing an SD issue culture (#I, #K); and Target 4.A  on creating educational facilities (#P). Labor issues cover a relevant spectrum as well. This shows evidence on aspects such as working policies and internal codes. First, by contributing to Goal 8: Decent Work , Target 8.5  on the achievement of productive employment and equal pay for people with disabilities or in vulnerable situations (#A, #B, #C, #D, #N); and Target 8.8  regarding the creation of secure working environments for migrants (#B) or employees well-being (#C, #P, #R). And second, by providing outcomes to Goal 5: Gender Equality , on Targets 5.1  and 5.5  focused on ending female discrimination and creating equal opportunities in working conditions (#A, #G, #N, #P). Similarly, a large number of B Corps concentrate on environmental issues. Firms in construction, agriculture, and the environmental sector showed a positive response to Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation , Target 6.3  on reducing pollution by improving water quality and increasing recycling (#B, #C, #I, #K); Target 6.4  on increasing water-use efficiency; Target 6.6  on protecting water-related ecosystem; and Target 6.B  by strengthening the participation of local communities for water sanitation management (#E, #F, #G, #H, #I). All B Corps are committed to reducing CO2  emissions, through central contributions focused on Goal 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure , Target 9.4 ; Goal 13: Climate Action , Target 13. 3 by improving education and awareness (#H, #I, #K); and Goal 14. Life Below Water , Target 14.1,  decreasing plastic pollution (#N). In addition, significant efforts are related to Goal 15. Life on Land  (#B, #C, #D, #E, #F, #G, #H, #I), by contributing to Target 15.3  on restoring land and combating soil degradation; Target 15.4  on mountain ecosystem preservation and biodiversity; Target 15.5  reducing the degradation of natural habitats; Target 15.7  protecting flora and fauna (#I); and Target 15.9  integrating biodiversity and ecosystem values into national development planning processes (#I). Another environmental line is linked to Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities , Target 11.6  reducing the environmental impact of cities (#B, #C, #F, #H, #I, #K, #Q); and Target 11.2  providing affordable sustainable transportation alternatives (#Q). In line with sustainable behaviors, a large group of B Corps links their activities to Goal 12. Responsible Consumption and Production  through Target 12.2  on promoting the efficient use of natural resources; Target 12.3  halving food waste avoiding losses along production and supply chains; Target 12.5  on promoting recycling and reuse; Target 12.6  on encouraging sustainable reporting; and Target 12.8  on creating SD and lifestyle awareness (#B, #C, #D, #E, #F, #G, #H, #I, #K, #N, #O, #Q). Finally, all the B Corps contribute to Goal 16. Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions , with Target 16.5  on reducing bribery, because of their commitment to anti-corruption practices. The relationship between the analyzed SPs and the corresponding SDGs are shown in Fig. 5  .  4.3 Comparison of HOs’ contributions to SDGs Building on the findings above, comparisons of SDGs’ contributions from HOs can be drawn. Extant literature reveals that HOs do not regard SDGs with the same relevance. In terms of HOs’ contributions to renowned SPs, SDGs are considered essential in different situations. To illustrate, Doherty (2018)  features the relevance of Goal 5  in a cocoa farmer’s cooperative in Ghana as a source of empowerment, economic growth, food security and enhanced health, and education; while Conway et al. (2019)  explore Goal  7 by analyzing how SEs provide solar home systems to informal settlements in South Africa and Zimbabwe and helps to minimize costs, to promote affordability, and to enhance local economic benefits. These results give evidence that HOs are great contributors to the SDGs since their core business activities are enacted on providing solutions to SPs. Besides, in line with this paper, studies reiterate that even though firms concentrate in one sector, they have the capacity to support other SDGs. For instance, Wang et al. (2020)  focused on Goal 14  in SEs of the maritime industry in China; however, the results showed that said sector contributes to Goals 3, 8,  and 11 . Similarly, Lehoux et al. (2018)  analyzed responsible innovation in health, an issue starkly linked to Goal 3 ; moreover, the study demonstrates that a combination of entrepreneurship and innovation directly contributes to Goals 4, 5, 8,  and 10 . It is also necessary to highlight the outlook of developing economies on the SDGs, to see if there are any correlations between these and the views held by HOs in emerging economies. According to Eichler and Schwarz (2019) , enterprises driving SI in developed economies most frequently focus on Goals 3 , 11 , and 17 , while developing countries predominantly concentrate on Goals 1, 3 , and 8.  In this line, Horne et al. (2020)  identified that social entrepreneurship in Germany contributes to Goals 3, 9,  and 12 , with little-observed activity in Goals 1  and 17 . Although some similarities are found in this paper, the main observation suggests that HOs centrally focus on SDGs linked to the country’s conditions and characteristics. Of specific interest for this paper is the use of theoretical frameworks referred to as business models. Particularly, Rahdari et al. (2016)  utilized the Canvas Business Model as an analytical tool for understanding the role that SEs play as engines of SD while filling a lack of an established epistemology on the topic. On the other hand, Littlewood and Holt (2018)  and Wang et al. (2020)  reinforce the idea outlined in this paper about how HOs can contribute to SDGs through their value chain and sustainable-oriented practices. Finally, the implementation of the SDGs reveals the instrumentality of this framework. Günzel-Jensen et al. (2020)  highlighted three types of SDGs utilization, namely evangelism, opportunism, and denial. Although this paper is not centered on this topic, the first two profiles were distinguished in this study by identifying firms that consciously focus on offering products/services that fulfill particular SDGs and enterprises that utilize SDGs rhetoric as a business opportunity, respectively. The last category did not couple with the results of this paper.   5 Conclusions This paper illustrated, through a multiple-case study, an analytical framework to understand how HOs contribute to the SDGs via analyzing CSI and the related solutions to renowned SPs in an emerging economy in Latin America. Although the study of HOs and their contribution to SDGs is an understudied topic, this paper highlights three reinforcing elements. First, HOs have great potential to contribute to SDGs since their business models are focused on providing solutions to SPs, and SDGs correspond to the most urgent problems facing humanity. Second, the needs of the operating environment and a country’s SPs shape business activities, leading HOs to adapt their capabilities to the most urgent domestic needs. Third, although HOs focus on specific sectors in a society, such firms have the potential to benefit multiple SDGs. Regarding the particular case of B Corps, although not all firms circumscribe SDGs in their business mission, they conduct activities that fulfill the UN mission. However, SDG applicability is still a challenge for enterprises since their contributions will depend on quantifiable outcomes that reach the targets and indicators sketched in the goals, and not all firms are able to measure the plethora of benefits that they bring to society. Particularly, this research indicates that Colombian B Corps show great commitment to issues related to agriculture-related challenges, corruption, climate change, labor, poverty, and unsustainable habits. Moreover, this represents a central limitation of doing business in Colombia since socio-economic conditions affect the overall performance of firms in the country. Although the analyzed B Corps contribute to 14 out of 17 SDGs, some goals stand out. First, B Lab guidelines towards carbon neutrality and anti-corruption practices foster overall B Corps commitment to Goals 9  and 16 . Second, a large group of B Corps (at least six of the sample) focuses on business opportunities derived from agriculture-related challenges, climate change, labor issues, poverty and inequalities, and unsustainable habits, resulting in significant contributions to Goals 2, 6, 8, 9, 10 , 11  and 12.  Third, B Corps are efficient in performing activities that are traditionally developed by governments by contributing to targets that were originally created for public institutions (Targets 2.A, 4.A,  or 6.B ). Finally, this research gives evidence that Colombian B Corps fulfill two of the current most pressing SDG challenges highlighted by the UN in the country (Goals 10  and 16 ). Regarding the theoretical contributions provided by this study, it is suggested that the CSI lenses are a useful tool for analyzing the SDGs that B Corps can achieve. Although the relationship between CSI and the SDGs is not linear and requires further research, this study contributes to the opportunity framework highlighted by former research in CSI. B Corps can accomplish various categories of CSI (Fig. 3 ) and follow institutionalization practices highlighted in CSI literature. Besides, CSI shows relevant commonalities with the B Corp business model. Centrally, this study presents relevant categories for analyzing CSI in HOs such as B Corps (Fig. 6  ). Five dimensions were identified (column 1) , characterized by focus elements of action (column 2 ), and configuring elements (column 3 ). The model relates elements such as a)  a business strategy characterized by a clear business mission and strong motivations; b)  the engagement of multiple stakeholders; c)  the implementation of an operational structure of procedures, metrics, and a cost structure that enables social/environmental impacts; d)  an organizational culture that configures norms and values that summarizes the business philosophy; and e)  procedures for outcome measurement guided by the creation of solutions to SPs with the power to persuade institutions through new ecosystems. Considering the governments’ interest in reaching the SDGs, it is expected that this paper enlightens some elements that could be considered when pursuing the UN’s agenda. As novel legislations are encouraging the creation of legal HOs in many countries, host country policymakers should provide further mechanisms and incentives for enterprises focused on social/environmental purposes to align common efforts targeting the SDGs. 5.1 Limitations and future directions Despite its contribution, this research has some shortcomings that should be addressed by future scholars. First, a limited number of Colombian B Corps were reached in the study, leaving aside enterprises from other relevant sectors (e.g., energy, education, optics, or sports). A larger sample with a broader range of enterprises from different sectors will shed more light on this topic. And second, result transferability is limited as the number of studied cases does not allow for statistical generalizations. Future studies are encouraged to compare different contexts and cultures on other developing countries through quantitative approaches. This study aims to encourage researchers to further explore HOs addressing social/environmental challenges in SD and SI.
