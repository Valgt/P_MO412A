                  The paper aims to conduct a thorough bibliometric study to investigate and comprehend how sustainable entrepreneurship contributes to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Sustainable entrepreneurship has evolved as a fundamental force behind positive social, environmental, and economic change, and sustainable development has become an urgent worldwide priority. We looked at a total of 1,357 papers on sustainable entrepreneurship that were published between 2002 and 2022. 679 of them have articles devoted explicitly to the SDGs. The Dimension database was used to locate prolific writers, sources, and influential articles interested in this field. According to the report, the SDGs SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) have been the most strongly impacted by sustainable entrepreneurship research. The most critical piece was likewise highlighted in the study as “Sustainable Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Innovation: Categories and Interactions.” The study uncovered Several essential research areas, including social entrepreneurship, innovation, impact investing, the plastics industry, the triple bottom line, supply chains, sustainable business, business networks, competitiveness, innovative economies, social efficiency, entrepreneurial marketing, and small and medium-sized enterprises. This study fills a vacuum in the existing literature by thoroughly reviewing the significant players and using a co-word analysis to pinpoint new research themes. This research seeks to clarify the contributions of sustainable entrepreneurship to the SDGs to promote future advancement and well-informed decision-making in sustainable development initiatives.

The paper aims to conduct a thorough bibliometric study to investigate and comprehend how sustainable entrepreneurship contributes to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Sustainable entrepreneurship has evolved as a fundamental force behind positive social, environmental, and economic change, and sustainable development has become an urgent worldwide priority. We looked at a total of 1,357 papers on sustainable entrepreneurship that were published between 2002 and 2022. 679 of them have articles devoted explicitly to the SDGs. The Dimension database was used to locate prolific writers, sources, and influential articles interested in this field. According to the report, the SDGs SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) have been the most strongly impacted by sustainable entrepreneurship research. The most critical piece was likewise highlighted in the study as “Sustainable Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Innovation: Categories and Interactions.” The study uncovered Several essential research areas, including social entrepreneurship, innovation, impact investing, the plastics industry, the triple bottom line, supply chains, sustainable business, business networks, competitiveness, innovative economies, social efficiency, entrepreneurial marketing, and small and medium-sized enterprises. This study fills a vacuum in the existing literature by thoroughly reviewing the significant players and using a co-word analysis to pinpoint new research themes. This research seeks to clarify the contributions of sustainable entrepreneurship to the SDGs to promote future advancement and well-informed decision-making in sustainable development initiatives.   Keywords Sustainable entrepreneurship  Green entrepreneurship  Sustainable development goals  SDG 11  SDG 12  Bibliometric analysis    1 Introduction Sustainability is typically more closely related to an organization’s all-encompassing strategy. It considers logistics as well as the entire production process. For instance, a green product made from recycled materials is more likely to be bought. There is no denying the impact of climate change on our planet’s priceless but limited resources [1] . One entrance point to start reforms toward sustainability will be entrepreneurship [2] . A new discipline called “sustainable entrepreneurship” has been developed by combining entrepreneurship and sustainability development [3] . Instead of being seen as a potential contributor to social injustice and environmental damage, entrepreneurship has been seen as a solution. The relationship between the processes of business formation and overall wellness is represented by sustainable entrepreneurship. With an emphasis on minimizing adverse effects on society, the environment, and the effective use of products and services, circular business models sparked intrapreneurship and entrepreneurial initiatives in the so-called sustainable economy [4] . Sustainable entrepreneurship is becoming increasingly important to several actors, including universities, businesses, and international organizations. The “United Nations’ 2030 Development Agenda” established a structure for international collaboration across sectors and levels of governance, which has favored the expansion of organizational support programs for the implementation of ecologically responsible entrepreneurial initiatives by businesses [5] . In specific, initiatives to promote sustainable entrepreneurship in industries like “agribusiness” [6] , “construction” [7] , and “energy” [8]  are stocking interested in evaluating the success of modifications to these industries’ production policy initiatives from the viewpoints of the environment and hygiene as well as from the standpoint of economic analysis [9] . Both academics and professionals consider the term “sustainability” to have many facets. Because sustainability and entrepreneurship were combined, it was widely believed that the products or services provided would benefit society, the environment, and individual rights to life. The concept of sustainable entrepreneurship, based on traditional entrepreneurship, is predicated on the notion that environmentally friendly products will yield a competitive advantage or financial gains [3] . Sustainable entrepreneurship involves launching new sustainable firms and maintaining and modifying current ones to make them more sustainable. Therefore, to varied degrees, sustainable entrepreneurship can occur in start-ups, small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs), and big businesses [3] . According to Hall et al. [10] , sustainable entrepreneurship’s objectives include sustainability and fairness, which is why it is so crucial. Promoting economic growth has been seen as a goal of entrepreneurship, while social and environmental issues have been ignored [11] . However, some academics argue that entrepreneurship should not be centered only on generating wealth due to the rising attention that “governments”, “non-governmental organizations”, “researchers”, and “enterprises” are providing to environmental challenges and the creation of the concept of sustainable development [12,13] . Additionally, some researchers claim that entrepreneurship is a tool that may guide many sectors of the economy toward environmental sustainability [13,14] . This sustainable entrepreneurship claims sustainable development is the cornerstone for creating sustainable company models because entrepreneurs can recognize long-term entrepreneurial potential [11] . Sustainable entrepreneurship is “the investigation of how possibilities to bring prospective products and services into presence are unearthed, formed, taken advantage of, by whom, and with what economic, psychological, cultural, ([15] ] p.35). Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and sustainable entrepreneurship are sometimes confused. From our perspective, CSR and sustainable entrepreneurship are understood in distinct ways. Although the primary objective is to achieve economic profit and any environmental and social initiatives only assist the core of the business, CSR might be seen as how companies explain their strategic intentions for sustainability. Thoughts on “social”, “environmental”, and economic performance are central to sustainable entrepreneurship [16] . By balancing the effects of their corporate, social, and environmental activities, Schaltegger and Wagner [17]  define sustainable entrepreneurship as a business strategy. Businesses use this strategy to increase efficiency and competitiveness. To advance sustainability, it entails findings, developing and utilizing business possibilities that help local communities in terms of social and environmental benefits. Shepherd and Patzelt [13]  further contend that entrepreneurs must incorporate sustainability into their business plan and modify it to build a successful company that supports development. As a result, during the past ten years, businesses and entrepreneurs have been more interested in learning about the actual effects of their operations on society and the environment [12] . As a result, non-financial benefits have been added to the classic definition of entrepreneurship, which stresses wealth creation in terms of monetary results [18] . These businesspeople’s capacity to influence other businesses and the broader public to adopt sustainable practices is crucial to upcoming environmental sustainability. The concepts that comprise sustainable entrepreneurship are examined in this scoping literature review, along with the degree to which they have been incorporated into the global business environment [19] . Understanding the importance of sustainable entrepreneurship requires understanding the operational settings – encompassing markets and other regulatory issues – where it revolutionizes. Entrepreneurs frequently display varied sustainability concerns due to their varying levels of contact with various external actors when exposed to various environmental stressors. They must acquire tangible and intangible assets from the surrounding environment to compete. Entrepreneurs who have behaved sustainably can meet the requirements of the present generation without endangering the welfare of future generations and who combine the three pillars of the economy, society, and the environment. In this line, legislation like the U.N. initiatives aims to motivate businesspeople to take ethical actions that benefit society and the environment [20] . To create effective strategies, policies, and interventions that advance sustainable development, policymakers, practitioners, and researchers must thoroughly understand how sustainable entrepreneurship contributes to the SDGs [21,22] . A comprehensive study is necessary to acquire insights into the present state of knowledge, identify research trends, and highlight prospective research gaps due to the size and diversity of the extant literature on this subject. To the greatest of our understanding, evaluations that have not been published have offered a comprehensive image of the key players or a co-word analysis of the primary research topics and emerging research themes that contribute to greater clarity in this area. Because of this, this research does a bibliometric analysis to evaluate the field’s status, identify the most critical goals being contributed to, identify key themes from previous research, and create future research subjects for this field. The format of the paper’s remaining section is as follows. The study starts with sustainable entrepreneurship introduction and its contribution to sustainable development goals. The study then goes into detail about the technique that was used before sharing the key findings. The study finishes the investigation and offers a research agenda for the future.  2 Methodology To support bibliometric analysis, the study uses data from the literature review. It is a widespread technique for assessing the independence of knowledge in any study field [23] . This study aids in analyzing the whole range of articles in any field and demonstrates the proper deployment of quantitative approaches with the help of bibliometric data [24] . The study also used a methodical approach to reviewing the literature. It is a method that meticulously synthesizes and identifies all research studies relevant to a topic based on high openness and quality at all levels [25] . Due to its ability to reduce bias, the systematic literature review is used in this review to synthesize the prior literature [26] . The “Scientific Procedures and Rationales for Systematic Literature Reviews (SPAR-4-SLR)” standards were used in this review. The rationale for choosing this approach is that “SPAR-4-SLR” is better than “PRISMA guidelines” regarding quality. Also, this approach includes “assembling”, “arranging”, and “assessing” articles as its three main processes [27] . The following list of review criteria is provided: 2.1 Assembling The research examined previous scholarly work where vital insights were gathered. As a result, numerous keyword combinations were constructed to find and acquire the range of papers on sustainable entrepreneurship. The keywords used are ((“Sustainable entrepreneurship”) OR (“Sustainable entrepreneur”) OR (“Sustainable start-ups”) OR (“Green Entrepreneurship”) OR (“Environmental entrepreneurship”) OR (“Eco-entrepreneurship”)) and yielded 1357 documents from the year 2002–2022, out of which 679 documents is related to contribution toward​ SDGs. The search strategy was carried out in March 2023 to gather publications in the field based on the identified keywords, with the search string being based on the title, abstract, and keywords. The Dimension database was utilized for the review since it is the central database with scholarly papers of higher quality than those in other databases. It is also most suitable for performing bibliometric analysis [28] .  2.2 Arranging The research implemented the categorization feature on the Dimension database to filter acquired data according to “year”, “subject”, “document type”, “source type”, “publishing stage”, and “language” to organize the identified and acquired articles after the assembly step. Each study’s description, results, and conclusions were carefully examined before the data were downloaded and transferred to an Excel file.  2.3 Assessing The research used the bibliometric review method to evaluate the 1357 articles on sustainable entrepreneurship. The bibliometric analysis employs a quantitative method to make academic works visible in real-time [29] . A systematic literature review process is also incorporated into the study, considerably boosting its transparency [30] . The bibliometric study employs quantitative methodologies on a large corpus of publications while minimizing bias and using qualitative judgment [31] . Using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer, the study uses bibliometric analysis to undertake “performance and science mapping analyses”. The former deconstructs publication patterns, influential articles, well-known authors, top nations, and affiliations. At the same time, in the latter, the main subjects and areas of sustainable entrepreneurship research are displayed [32] . Further study in this area is curated by the review based on the synthesis of prior material. The findings are reported in the following sections of the paper, with tables and figures serving as the narrative support. Fig. 1  shows the SPAR-4-SLR flowchart.     3 Analysis 3.1 Performance analysis 3.1.1 Publication trend and contribution to SDG The publication trend in sustainable entrepreneurship is depicted in Fig. 2 . It should be highlighted that since 2002, there has been research in this area. The publication pattern has been on the rise since 2015. With a total of 304 documents, the year 2022 is renowned for having a high quantity of scientific production. There is an increasing trend in citations for the publication “sustainable entrepreneurship” from 2002 to 2022, with the highest number of citations in 2022 (total citations of 5790). This suggests that the publication has significantly impacted and influenced sustainable entrepreneurship. Fig. 3  shows the top 3 SDGs being evolved from sustainable entrepreneurship research. They are SDG 11, SDG 12, and SDG 8. SDG 11 and 12 fall under the high research productivity and influence category, having the highest Total Publications (T.P.) and Total Citations (T.C.). SDG 11 has a T.P. and T.C. of 162 and 3178 each, followed by SDG 12 with T.P. and T.C. of 122 and 2515, respectively. Whereas SDG 8 comes under the category of high research productivity, this SDG has high publications of 108 documents but with low citations of 1121.     3.1.2 The most influential article Table 1  shows the top 10 influential articles on sustainable entrepreneurship. It shows that the most influential article is “Sustainable Entrepreneurship and sustainability innovation: Categories and Interactions”. This article has the highest citation of 963 and contributes to SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production). This was followed by an article, “Market imperfections, opportunity, and sustainable entrepreneurship”, with a T.C. of 835. According to Cohen and Winn [15] , these changes lay the groundwork for an emerging paradigm of sustainable entrepreneurship that enables founders to profit while enhancing social and environmental conditions locally and globally.    3.1.3 Top contributing journal According to their overall output in the area of sustainable entrepreneurship. With 54 publications and 2434 citations, the “Journal of Cleaner Production” journals are in the top positions. The academics increased their contributions to these fields because the “Journal of Business Venturing” is one of the top contributing sources regarding citations with a T.C. of 3401 and T.P. of 11. Fig. 4  shows the bibliographic coupling of the source titles. The Journal of Cleaner Production has the highest links with other sources, followed by the Business Strategy and the Environment.    3.1.4 Most prolific authors With a combined T.P. of 15, 10, and 8, respectively, Stefan C Schaltegger, Vanessan Ratten, and Jacob Hörisch are the prolific authors in the sustainability entrepreneurship study. The other prolific authors are Shascha Kraus, Erik G Hansen, Jeffrey G York, and Elias George Carayannis. Fig. 5  shows the bibliographic coupling of the authors. Author Stefan C Schalteggar strongly collaborates with other authors in sustainable entrepreneurship. Stefan C Schalteggar’s most cited article is “Sustainable Entrepreneurship and sustainability innovation: Categories and Interactions”, with a citation of 963. This particular article contributes to SDG 12.     3.2 Science mapping Fig. 6  displays a theme analysis with four distinct quadrants, each with a distinctive influence and degree of significance. The right upper quadrant is believed to contain a driving element with significant influence and importance. It makes use of words like “sustainability”, “entrepreneurs”, “role”, “entrepreneurial”, “impact”, and “students”. This segment’s research concentrated on the role of entrepreneurs in remaining sustainable and the impact of entrepreneurial intention and ecosystem on students. The bottom right quadrant is the foundation theme with “high centrality and minimal impact”. The keywords under the topics are crucial to analyze even though they took into account their minimal influence. “Entrepreneurship”, “sustainable development”, “environmental”, “social”, and “economy” are some of the different keywords associated with this theme. More investigation across numerous elements makes the study more fruitful because these factors are crucial to this research subject. The niche topic with significant effect and low centrality is thought to be in the upper left quadrant. “Factors”, “context”, “exploring”, etc. are some of the crucial words associated with the issue. More research must be curated for a better knowledge of the many features of this domain due to the substantial influence of these elements in this domain. An emerging or fading theme is in the lower left quadrant with minimal impact and centrality. “Business model”, “energy”, “green”, “study”, and “support” are a few of the words in this quadrant. Despite the low impact and centrality, more research must be conducted in this field from diverse angles to get novel viewpoints (see Fig. 6 ).    3.3 Network analysis Using the VOSviewer program, the network analysis considers the keyword co-occurrence method. The significant clusters in any study field are shown in this analysis. Also, this method comprises a corpus of papers that illustrate the key topics that define the conceptual framework of each research field [39] . This study presents the network analysis based on the top 2 SDGs evolved, i.e., SDG 11 and SDG 12. 3.3.1 SDG 11 Sustainable business owners develop original responses to urban problems. The three significant clusters under SDG 11 in sustainable entrepreneurship are shown in Fig. 7  in network analysis. The accompanying summary description is shown in Table 2 , along with the themes and keywords.   Cluster 1 (Red): Influence of green entrepreneurship in the Community and Organization  The development and management of firms that prioritize environmental sustainability are known as “green entrepreneurship”, it can profoundly affect both groups of people and institutions. Green entrepreneurship can positively affect the neighborhood by creating jobs and boosting the local economy. Also, green enterprises can lower environmental pollutants, enhance the quality of life, and foster a healthier environment for locals. Green business owners frequently develop novel and environmentally friendly goods and services that can improve the market and society. A more sustainable company ecosystem could inspire other business owners to adopt environmentally friendly practices. Researchers may be able to obtain an understanding of the intricate interactions between specialized actors and the dominant regime under the existing energy policy environment by seeing the low-carbon energy transformation as a social welfare system. Under the perspective of sustainable entrepreneurship, community-led energy projects were examined in the study of Acharya and Cave [40]  to identify the business strategies employed by these specialized actors in the socio-technical context of the energy transition. Also, Alwakid et al. [41]  investigate the influence of green entrepreneurial activities on sustainable development. Cluster 2 (Blue): Importance and Opportunity of sustainable entrepreneurship  Sustainable entrepreneurship is essential to achieve Sustainable Development Goal SDG 11, which aims to build inclusive, resilient, and sustainable cities and communities. By offering eco-friendly solutions to urban problems like waste management, energy efficiency, and transportation, sustainable entrepreneurship gives firms a chance to contribute to the sustainability of urban areas. Social challenges, including access to essential amenities, affordable housing, and job development, are also addressed by sustainable businesses [42] . Sustainable business owners can use technology and innovation to build enterprises that benefit urban areas and the environment. Sustainable entrepreneurship helps accomplish SDG 11 by fostering sustainable urbanization and allows companies to build a more sustainable future. Individuals require standards and principles that go further than the appropriation of concrete commercial results for themselves when dealing with complicated value-driven problems like sustainable development. This raises the issue of what function personal moral backgrounds serve in the entrepreneurship activities of opportunity identification for sustainable development [43] . Cluster 3 (Green): Government support and growth strategies for sustainable entrepreneurship for sustainable innovation  For the development and success of sustainable entrepreneurship for sustainable innovation, government assistance and growth plans are crucial. Governments can offer financial aid, tax breaks, and legal protections to promote sustainable entrepreneurship. Governments can also develop legal frameworks supporting sustainability, such as environmental performance standards, sustainable purchasing guidelines, and carbon pricing schemes. These regulations may level the playing field for sustainable business owners and encourage corporate sustainability initiatives. Governments can also offer training and capacity-building initiatives to help entrepreneurs get the expertise required to run long-term enterprises. Governments may encourage sustainable innovation and economic growth while addressing environmental and social issues by encouraging sustainable entrepreneurship [44] .  3.3.2 SDG 12 The three significant clusters under SDG 12 in sustainable entrepreneurship are shown in Fig. 8  in network analysis. The accompanying summary description is shown in Table 3 , along with the themes and keywords.   Cluster 1 (Red): Green entrepreneurship and green economy to reduce waste in production.  The existing business models are undergoing changes motivated by the need to solve severe global issues related to unrestricted waste production and divestment and the haphazard use of the earth’s resources. Green entrepreneurship and the green economy are increasingly recognized as essential tools for reducing waste in production. By adopting sustainable production methods, businesses can reduce waste, conserve resources, and lower their carbon footprint. By promoting the growth of the green economy, governments can create opportunities for green entrepreneurship and reduce waste in production. Green entrepreneurship and the green economy are crucial for promoting sustainable production and consumption and reducing waste in production [45] . Cluster 2 (Green): Case studies on sustainable entrepreneurship  Various case studies have been conducted on sustainable entrepreneurship for responsible consumption and production [45,46] . Case studies on sustainable entrepreneurship provide valuable insights into sustainable businesses’ successful development and growth. These studies focus on specific industries, regions, or themes and examine the factors contributing to sustainable entrepreneurship’s success. These studies can provide valuable lessons for entrepreneurs looking to start or grow sustainable businesses and policymakers and investors seeking to support sustainable entrepreneurship. By highlighting successful sustainable businesses and the factors that contribute to their success, case studies can inspire and inform sustainable entrepreneurship and contribute to the transition to a more sustainable economy. Cluster 3 (Blue): A transition toward the circular economy  Focusing on a circular economy highlights the significance of developing a more sustainable economy where waste is reduced and resources are used more effectively [47] . It is a good idea to have a backup plan. By creating novel business models that put sustainability and resource efficiency first, sustainable entrepreneurship can accelerate the shift to a circular economy. Moreover, sustainable entrepreneurship can create new markets and opportunities for sustainable products and services. Sustainable business owners can accelerate the shift to a circular economy and help achieve SDG 12 by satisfying the rising demand for sustainable goods and services [48] .    4 Future research directions The findings of this study offer various directions for future investigation. Based on the prominence percentile from SciVal, we arrived at potential future research areas. The themes are arranged using momentum, a gauge of a field’s momentum. The following inquiries will be assisted by topic prominence [49] : “Which prominent themes are most likely to receive good funding and consequently have better grant success rates?” “Who else is conducting and publishing research on a subject related to mine with whom I could collaborate and co-author?” “What are some hotly debated, closely related subjects where I could concentrate my study?” Table 4  shows the future research topics and their prominence percentile.   4.1 Social entrepreneurship; Innovation; Impact investing Scholars are showing increasing interest in social entrepreneurs and social enterprises. These individuals and organizations are known for using innovative and entrepreneurial approaches to address the needs of marginalized or excluded populations who cannot effect change. While the concept of social entrepreneurship has been around since the 1950s, it has only gained significant attention in the past ten years as a prominent and influential area of research [50] . With the use of digital technologies, entrepreneurial organizations have embraced cutting-edge strategies to address societal issues that seem insurmountable. By concentrating on the digital toolkit used by cutting-edge firms, we offer a study agenda that raises fresh inquiries about “entrepreneurship”, “business models”, “ecosystems”, and “institutional logic” [51] .  4.2 Plastic industry; Innovation; Triple bottom line The strategies businesses employ while developing their sustainability platforms have received much attention. However, more is needed to know about how sustainability goals are set differently worldwide, particularly in emerging nations [52] . A plan that considers not only economic objectives but also environmental and social considerations, balances them out, and ultimately secures the long-term success of a corporation is known as sustainable corporate development. Although more businesses today focus on corporate sustainability, there are still several barriers to adoption [53] .  4.3 Supply chain; Sustainable business; Business network Future developments in supply chain management suggest a shift toward a more sustainable strategy. Businesses are expected to concentrate on lowering emissions, energy use, and waste along the entire supply chain. This entails improved traceability and transparency in production, logistics, and raw material procurement processes. As consumers want more goods and services that are socially and ecologically responsible, sustainable business practices will continue to spread. This calls for businesses to adopt a circular economy model that reduces waste and reuses or recycles materials. Business networks are anticipated to impact supply chain management significantly [54,55] .  4.4 Competitiveness; Innovative economy; Social efficiency The state of people and the world’s surface are changing due to city growth. Urban systems with millions of residents are the most intricate examples of collective human ingenuity. Metropolitan agglomerations, which receive their supplies from an ever-more-global hinterland, are taking center stage in Earth’s human presence. We have a fantastic potential to create an entirely new set of green technologies for usage in urban areas. Cities serve as communication hubs, and new technological systems have significantly strengthened this function. Cities in the next millennium will be resource-energy-efficient, hospitable to people, and rich in culture, with active democracies ensuring the best usage of human energies [56] . Also, technology must be transferred, absorbed, adjusted, and, in the best circumstances, altered to meet new needs to achieve technical self-reliance in the broadest sense. The social and organizational methods used to achieve these aims are nearly as different as the social formations involved. Adapting to new technology from outside or domestic laboratory setups takes time. The concentration involves various stages, and sound absorption entails addressing unforeseen challenges and running the manufacturing facility under “normal” conditions [57] .  4.5 Entrepreneurial marketing; Entrepreneurship; Small and medium-sized enterprises Entrepreneurs must unlearn established principles and substitute them with fresh, creative ideas and activities, such as entrepreneurial marketing, when traditional marketing approaches are unsuited for small and medium firms [58] . SMEs rely on marketing as one of their most crucial strategies for surviving and expanding, but it is also seen as their most significant difficulty. Operating in a setting with rising volatility, turbulence, and rivalry, it is recommended that entrepreneurs go beyond standard marketing concepts and transform them using new, creative ideas and actions, such as entrepreneurial marketing. A recent study theme evolved at the junction of marketing and entrepreneurship fields when it was recognized that traditional marketing strategies do not fit small and medium firms [59] .   5 Conclusion The sustainable entrepreneurship literature was thoroughly examined in this study. By reviewing from 2002–2022, the study employed bibliometric analysis and visualization approaches to highlight future research topics and solve the gaps in the existing literature. The increase in publications over time demonstrates the scholarly community’s growing dedication to and interest in advancing the study of and promotion of sustainable entrepreneurship. The top 3 SDGs being evolved from sustainable entrepreneurship research are SDG 11, SDG 12, and SDG 8. The most influential article is “Sustainable Entrepreneurship and sustainability innovation: Categories and Interactions”. According to their overall output in sustainable entrepreneurship, the “Journal of Cleaner Production” journal is in the top position. Stefan C Schaltegger, Vanessan Ratten, and Jacob Hörisch are prolific authors in the sustainability entrepreneurship study. Using the VOSviewer program, the network analysis considers the keyword co-occurrence method. The significant clusters in any study field are shown in this analysis. Also, this method comprises a corpus of papers that illustrate the key topics that define the conceptual framework of each research field. The network analysis was done for the top two SDGs, SDG 11 and SDG 12. The findings of this study offer various directions for future investigation. Based on the prominence percentile from SciVal, we arrived at potential future research areas. The themes are arranged using momentum, a gauge of a field’s momentum. The prominent topics evolved are “Social Entrepreneurship; Innovation; Impact investing”, “Plastic Industry; Innovation; Triple Bottom Line”, “Supply chain; Sustainable Business; Business Network”, “Competitiveness; Innovative economy; Social efficiency”, “Entrepreneurial marketing; Entrepreneurship; Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises”. It is critical to understand that research is only partial and with constraints. One potential drawback is that certain publications might have needed to be noticed in studying the keywords used to shortlist articles since they were not made plain in the publications’ titles, abstracts, or keywords. The statistical analysis may need to be more consistent due to this. However, the study’s citation analysis method only considers the cited papers’ significance. It does not distinguish between pieces that concentrate solely on the SDGs and those that briefly mention both sustainable entrepreneurship and the SDGs.   Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
