                  The increasing urgency of global environmental degradation, particularly across diverse economic development stages, underscores a critical need for nuanced understanding and targeted strategies to achieve Sustainable Development Goals. Our study examines environmental efficiency trends over 27 years in 163 countries, utilizing greenhouse gases and particulate matter 2.5 as indicators. We address the challenge by developing and applying a two-stage method that combines a hyperbolic distance function with a stochastic meta frontier approach to assess environmental meta-efficiency. The average meta efficiency of these countries is 0.464, which remains at a relatively low level. Our model indicates that the high-income country group needs to reduce greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions by 25% and increase non-fossil energy usage by 33% to improve environmental efficiency. This suggests these countries must transition towards more sustainable energy sources and practices. Moreover, recognizing that existing income grouping inadequately characterizes each country, we use k-means cluster analysis for regrouping, more accurately reflecting individual differences. The regrouping results show that some high-income countries are classified into inactive groups, implying serious environmental problems. Our findings advocate for collaborative and tailored strategies to address these disparities. We conclude that income levels cannot solely drive environmental efficiency but must also consider geographical and climatic factors, which are pivotal in shaping a country’s environmental policies and efforts. This approach offers a clearer understanding of current inefficiencies and sets the stage for more informed policy-making that can better address the specific needs and capabilities of different countries.

The increasing urgency of global environmental degradation, particularly across diverse economic development stages, underscores a critical need for nuanced understanding and targeted strategies to achieve Sustainable Development Goals. Our study examines environmental efficiency trends over 27 years in 163 countries, utilizing greenhouse gases and particulate matter 2.5 as indicators. We address the challenge by developing and applying a two-stage method that combines a hyperbolic distance function with a stochastic meta frontier approach to assess environmental meta-efficiency. The average meta efficiency of these countries is 0.464, which remains at a relatively low level. Our model indicates that the high-income country group needs to reduce greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions by 25% and increase non-fossil energy usage by 33% to improve environmental efficiency. This suggests these countries must transition towards more sustainable energy sources and practices. Moreover, recognizing that existing income grouping inadequately characterizes each country, we use k-means cluster analysis for regrouping, more accurately reflecting individual differences. The regrouping results show that some high-income countries are classified into inactive groups, implying serious environmental problems. Our findings advocate for collaborative and tailored strategies to address these disparities. We conclude that income levels cannot solely drive environmental efficiency but must also consider geographical and climatic factors, which are pivotal in shaping a country’s environmental policies and efforts. This approach offers a clearer understanding of current inefficiencies and sets the stage for more informed policy-making that can better address the specific needs and capabilities of different countries.

Despite improvements in air quality in high-income countries, regions such as small island developing States and low- and middle-income countries continue to experience stagnant or deteriorating air quality. This uneven progress highlights critical gaps in environmental management and the urgent need for enhanced policy implementation, especially as limited monitoring capabilities compound these issues. These challenges are further exacerbated by human-induced global warming, which leads to extreme weather events that disproportionately impact the most vulnerable communities, underlining the need for effective global strategies to address these pressing environmental concerns. Recent developments in global policy, particularly the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), have aimed to address these disparities. SDG-7, for instance, focuses on ensuring everyone has access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services by 2030 (United Nations, 2023 ). This goal highlights the pivotal role of energy management in environmental sustainability, especially considering that fossil fuels, a major source of greenhouse gases, account for a significant portion of global emissions. Chen et al. (2024)  found that economies should achieve sustainable development goals by decoupling energy consumption from economic growth. Sustainable development underscores the challenge of balancing present economic needs with the long-term health of the environment. However, this balance is often jeopardized by the environmental costs of economic growth. For example, China’s rapid industrialization has led to a 30% increase in carbon emissions over the past decade. Brazil’s pursuit of economic growth has resulted in a 25% reduction in forest cover, severely impacting biodiversity and ecosystem services. Quito et al. (2023)  indicate that energy efficiency varies among European countries, with nations like Russia and Estonia needing to accelerate their transition to renewable energy sources to achieve sustainable financial development. These examples highlight the critical need for a comprehensive understanding of environmental efficiency as economies grow. Coordinated development is crucial to achieving the SDGs. Collaborative development refers to the cooperation of various departments within a country to reduce pollutants and carbon emissions and the exchange of technology and capital between countries. Therefore, we need to establish an indicator to understand each country’s environmental status correctly. Despite extensive research on the link between the economy and the environment, existing studies often need to pay more attention to intrinsic characteristics and natural conditions unique to each country. Previous methods have yet to consider factors such as a country’s self-purification capacity, including carbon sinks and atmospheric self-purification abilities, which vary significantly based on climate, geography, and ecosystem. For example, countries with abundant forests may have greater self-purification capacities than desert-dominated regions. Additionally, many studies have relied on prior information like geography or income levels for country grouping, which may not accurately reflect individual country characteristics, potentially leading to misleading conclusions. Unlike these approaches, our study employs the k-means clustering method to regroup countries using multiple indicators, thereby addressing the limitations of mean–variance methods that rely on a single efficiency value. Moreover, traditional studies often use Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as the desirable output and Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions as the undesirable output, which may not adequately capture the complexities of environmental efficiency. To improve precision, we include Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5 ) as an additional undesirable output, representing the impact of air pollution on environmental efficiency. In this study, we introduce an innovative approach to calculate the environmental efficiency of countries, integrating a refined Hyperbolic Distance Function (HDF) with Stochastic Metafrontier Analysis (SMFA). This novel method allows for a more nuanced estimation of environmental efficiency, considering a broad spectrum of factors including natural resources and industrial structures. Unlike traditional models that often overlook the intrinsic heterogeneity among countries, our approach controls for this variability, providing a more accurate reflection of environmental efficiency across diverse economic contexts. This methodological advancement enables us to offer tailored recommendations for sustainable development, ensuring that strategies are effectively aligned with the specific economic and environmental characteristics of different income groups. Consequently, our research not only enhances the analytical framework for assessing environmental efficiency but also explores the capacity for environmental self-purification. The organization of the remainder of this paper is as follows: Section 2  reviews the literature, setting the stage for our analysis. Section 3  details our methodologies. Section 4  presents our findings on environmental efficiency across 163 countries. Section 5  discusses these results in the context of global environmental challenges, and Section 6  concludes the paper, summarizing key insights and implications for future research and policy-making.  2 Literature review Environmental efficiency, particularly concerning GHG and PM2.5  emissions, has emerged as a central focus in global environmental research. Studies utilize various metrics for this purpose, emphasizing carbon efficiency through CO 2     or GHG emissions (Yang and Kim, 2022; Xiao et al., 2023 ), while others consider additional pollutants (Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019; Feng et al., 2020 ). The expansive nature of this research spans different industries and regions, ranging from specific sectors like airlines, cement plants, and farms (Tu et al., 2022; Ali and See, 2023; Türkten and Ceyhan, 2023 ) to broader geographical studies (Iram et al., 2020; Hao et al., 2023; Naeem et al., 2023 ). Building on this extensive body of research, our study employs GHG and PM2.5  emissions as standard indicators to investigate environmental efficiency at the national level. Nonparametric and parametric methods are the two main categories of environmental efficiency calculation techniques. The principal parametric method is the Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA), which was first introduced by Aigner et al. (1977)  and Meeusen and van Den Broeck (1977) . In contrast, the main nonparametric method is the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach (Charnes et al., 1978 ). However, according to Coelli et al. (2005) , the DEA cannot distinguish between idiosyncratic errors from inefficiency errors. The SFA captures the random elements impacting production and offers a more precise efficiency estimate by including both error terms in the function. The SFA method requires specifying a functional form, and we will use the hyperbolic distance and translog function form mentioned in Cuesta et al. (2009) . A recent study on OECD countries sheds light on the impact of Information Communication Technology (ICT), human capital, and globalization on environmental degradation from 1990 to 2018. Ahmad et al. (2023)  indicates that while ICT, renewable energy consumption, and human capital contribute positively to environmental sustainability, globalization, economic growth, and non-renewable energy consumption exacerbate environmental degradation. This highlights the complex interplay between technological advancement, globalization, and environmental outcomes, underscoring the need for balanced growth policies that consider environmental sustainability. Furthermore, countries at different stages of development face unique environmental challenges: advanced countries like the U.S., Germany, and France are transitioning towards a sustainable economy through technological innovation despite their historical contribution to environmental degradation (Millstein et al., 2017 ). In contrast, developing countries such as India and China grapple with balancing economic growth and environmental protection amid limited resources and technological capabilities (Mohan and Topp, 2018; Hao et al., 2023 ). Therefore, it is essential to consider heterogeneity issues when studying these countries thoroughly. SMFA method can effectively control heterogeneity issues. We also refer to the Mean–variance method described by Zhang et al. (2020b)  and Kang and Kang (2022) , which can solve heterogeneity issues after calculating efficiency scores. However, the Mean–variance method can only improve heterogeneity issues related to a single efficiency score. This study will continue to use the SMF method and, combining it with the ability of the SMF method to calculate group efficiency, technology gap, and meta-efficiency scores, will use the k-means cluster analysis method after obtaining efficiency scores to address heterogeneity issues strictly. Specifically, we will combine the HDF and the SMFA to measure environmental efficiency. The HDF is computed multiplicatively, satisfies the property of almost homogeneity, and is calculated using a translog form function. Färe et al. (1985)  proposed a hyperbolic function that measures efficiency by reducing inputs and expanding outputs. This method solves the problem that traditional distance functions can only be oriented towards inputs or outputs. Cuesta and Zofío (2005)  developed a translog function of hyperbolic distance. In a later study, Cuesta et al. (2009)  proposed an enhanced hyperbolic distance function that can reduce inputs and undesirable outputs and increase desirable outputs. They also discussed the differences between the hyperbolic and directional distance functions used in Färe et al. (2005) . Several studies have also investigated this kind of environmental efficiency (Zhang and Ye, 2015; Duman and Kasman, 2018; Adenuga et al., 2019 ). Although environmental factors are included in the function, we observed that the dependent variable of these studies is desirable output (gross domestic product, electricity generated, and milk sales). Despite their article mentioning that they calculate environmental efficiency, we consider its technical efficiency. Based on Herrala and Goel (2012) , we will use the undesirable output (pollution output) as a dependent variable to measure real environmental efficiency. Table 1  summarizes these studies, highlighting variations in methodologies and research focuses that emphasize the distinctions between these studies and the current work.  Moreover, in exploring the determinants of environmental efficiency, most studies have neglected the influence of environmental conditions. Existing research has primarily focused on economic development factors such as urbanization (Zhang and Deng, 2022 ), foreign direct investment (FDI) (Wu et al., 2022 ), industrial structure (Zhang et al., 2020a ), and environmental regulation (Hashmi and Alam, 2019 ), often overlooking how a country’s inherent environmental conditions impact its efficiency. To fill this gap, my study introduces the concept of self-purification capacity, examining its role in environmental efficiency scores. This approach broadens the analysis beyond economic factors, integrating environmental characteristics to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the drivers of environmental efficiency. Our review of the literature highlights a critical gap in how environmental efficiency models account for intrinsic national characteristics and natural conditions, which vary significantly between countries. Most current models standardize outputs across diverse economic and environmental systems, leading to potentially oversimplified policy recommendations. Our study introduces an innovative approach that incorporates a more granular analysis of the self-purification capacities of different environments, thereby enhancing the precision of environmental efficiency assessments and the relevance of resulting policy recommendations. While existing literature offers valuable insights into environmental efficiency, this study aims to address several gaps and limitations. First, the current stage of environmental conditions in each country is described in the context of the country’s stage of economic development and environmental self-purification capacity. We introduce this concept to pay attention to the country’s own intrinsic characteristics and natural conditions while considering the relationship between economic growth and environmental efficiency of each country. Second, we creatively combine the HDF and SMFA approaches to delve into environmental efficiency patterns exhibited by governments at different income levels. This method can not only take advantage of the distance function to solve multiple undesirable output problems (Färe et al., 1985, 2012 ), but also solve the heterogeneity problem between countries with different income levels. Third, Kang and Kang (2022)  used a priori grouping information, which may not adequately reflect the individual characteristics of each country. This study proposes a novel approach to regrouping countries using k-means cluster analysis, which allows countries to be classified using multiple indicators to provide a more detailed and accurate heterogeneity analysis. This study aims to contribute to the existing literature by providing a more systematic, comprehensive, and technically differentiated perspective on global environmental efficiency. The following questions will be addressed in this paper. First, consider global environmental efficiency trends and the current state over 27 years. The second question is whether developed countries are close to the environmental frontier. The third question is about the factors that influence environmental efficiency.  3 Model 3.1 Group Environmental Efficiency (GEE) estimation Production is a process of transformation of input vectors x  i   = ( x  i 1   , … , x  K i   )  ∈ R  +  K     , desirable output vectors v  i   = ( v  1 i   , … , v  M i   )  ∈ R  +  M     , and undesirable output vectors w  i   = ( w  1 i   , … , w  R i   )  ∈ R  +  R     , where i   represent the processes of countries. The production possibility set representing the technology is specified as follows: (1) T = ( x , v , w )  ∈ R  +  K   , ( v , w )  ∈ R  +  M , R   , x  c a n  p r o d u c e  ( v , w )         which is assumed to satisfy the axioms in Färe and Primont (1994) . The axioms state that: (i) possibility of inaction, (ii) weak disposability of outputs, (iii) T   is a bounded and closed set.1  1 For details of these axioms, please refer to Fare and Primont (1994), Multi-Output Production and Duality: Theory and Applications, Chapter 2, pp. 13–14.   HDF can also represent production technology T  . This function maximizes the desired output given several inputs and allows the producer to reach the production frontier. Cuesta et al. (2009)  constructed an enhanced hyperbolic distance function (EHDF) by extending Cuesta and Zofío (2005) ’s method. Following Cuesta et al. (2009) , EHDF is defined as: (2) D  E   ( x , v , w )  = inf θ > 0 : ( x θ , v / θ , w θ )  ∈ T         HDF derives its name from the hyperbolic path from the production point to the production frontier. The model is “enhanced” because it has the condition of proportional reduction of inputs. The range of the EHDF is 0 < D  E   ( x , v , w )  ≤ 1   . If the technology satisfies the customary axioms, then EHDF satisfies the following axioms listed by Cuesta et al. (2009) : (1) Almost homogeneous: D  E   . 1 :    D  E   ( ϕ  − 1   x , ϕ v , ϕ  − 1   w )  = ϕ D  E   ( x , v , w )  ,    ϕ > 0   . (2) Non-decreasing in desirable outputs D  E   . 2 :    D  E   ( x , λ v , w )  ≤ D  E   ( x , v , w )  ,    λ ∈ [ 0 , 1 ]    . (3) Non-increasing in undesirable outputs D  E   . 3 :    D  E   ( x , v , λ w )  ≤ D  E   ( x , v , w )  ,    λ ≥ 1   . (4) Non-increasing in inputs D  E   . 4 :    D  E   ( λ x , v , w )  ≤ D  E   ( x , v , w )  ,    λ ≥ 1   . And then, to compute the EHDF, we assume a function F ( x , v , w )     is a translog form function and almost homogeneous of degrees k  1   , k  2   , k  3   , k  4      if: (3) F ( ϕ  k  1     x , ϕ  k  2     v , ϕ  k  3     w )  = ϕ  k  4     F ( x , v , w )  , ∀ ϕ > 0       The EHDF is almost homogeneous of degrees (−1, 1, −1, 1). Therefore, the undesired output and input will decline proportionally simultaneously as the desired output will increase. Also, the function will increase in the same proportion. In this case, the almost homogeneity condition corresponding to axioms (3) states that for a scalar ϕ > 0    and any ( x , v , w )   , we can find: (4) D  E   ( x  ϕ   , ϕ v , w  ϕ   )  = inf θ > 0 : ( θ x  ϕ   , ϕ v  θ   , θ w  ϕ   )  ∈ T   = inf ϕ θ  ϕ   > 0 : ( θ  ϕ   x , v  θ / ϕ   , θ  ϕ   w )  ∈ T   = ϕ inf ( θ  ϕ   )  > 0 : ( θ  ϕ   x , v  θ / ϕ   , θ  ϕ   w )  ∈ T   = ϕ D  E   ( x , v , w )        We depart from Eq. (3) . Assuming that F ( x , v , w )     is continuously differentiable, to be almost homogeneous, it must satisfy: (5) k  1   ∑  k = 1  K   ∂ F  ∂ x  k     x  k   + k  2   ∑  m = 1  M   ∂ F  ∂ v  m     v  m   + k  3   ∑  R = 1  R   ∂ F  ∂ w  r     w  r   = k  4   F       The translog form function of F ( x , v , w )     is: (6) ln F = α  0   + ∑  k = 1  K   α  k   ln x  k i   + 1  2   ∑  k = 1  K   ∑  l = 1  K   α  k l   ln x  k i   ln x  l i   + ∑  m = 1  M   β  m   ln v  m i   +  1  2   ∑  m = 1  M   ∑  n = 1  M   β  m n   ln v  m i   ln v  n i   + ∑  r = 1  R   χ  r   ln w  r i   + 1  2   ∑  r = 1  R   ∑  s = 1  R   χ  r s   ln w  r i   ln w  s i   +  ∑  k = 1  K   ∑  m = 1  M   δ  k m   ln x  k i   ln v  m i   + ∑  k = 1  K   ∑  r = 1  R   ς  k r   ln x  k i   ln w  r i   + ∑  m = 1  M   ∑  r = 1  R   ξ  m r   ln v  m i   ln w  r i   , ( i = 1 , 2 , … , N )        Using the logarithmic specifications ∂ F  ∂ x  k     x  k    F   = ∂ ln F  ∂ ln x  k       , ∂ F  ∂ v  m     v  m    F   = ∂ ln F  ∂ ln v  m       , ∂ F  ∂ w  r     w  r    F   = ∂ ln F  ∂ ln w  r       , the relevant partial derivatives for the translog form of F ( x , v , w )     become: (7) ∂ ln F  ∂ ln x  k     = α  k   + ∑  k = 1  K   α  k l   ln x  l   + ∑  m = 1  M   δ  k m   ln v  m   + ∑  r = 1  R   ς  k r   ln w  r   ,    ( k = 1 , 2 , … , K )       (8) ∂ ln F  ∂ ln v  m     = β  m   + ∑  n = 1  M   β  m n   ln v  n   + ∑  k = 1  K   δ  k m   ln x  k   + ∑  r = 1  R   ξ  m r   ln w  r   ,    ( m = 1 , 2 , … , M )       (9) ∂ ln F  ∂ ln w  r     = χ  r   + ∑  s = 1  R   χ  r s   ln w  s   + ∑  k = 1  K   ς  k r   ln x  k   + ∑  m = 1  M   ξ  m r   ln v  m   ,    ( r = 1 , 2 , … , R )        The translog HDF must satisfy the homogeneity degrees of (−1, 1, −1, 1), therefore we depart from Eq. (5) : (10) − ∂ ln F  ∂ ln x  k     + ∂ ln F  ∂ ln v  m     − ∂ ln F  ∂ ln w  r     = 1       Then, substituting (7) , (8) , (9)  to (10)  we get: (11) − ( α  k   + ∑  k = 1  K   α  k l   ln x  l   + ∑  m = 1  M   δ  k m   ln v  m   + ∑  r = 1  R   ς  k r   ln w  r   )  +  ( β  m   + ∑  n = 1  M   β  m n   ln v  n   + ∑  k = 1  K   δ  k m   ln x  k   + ∑  r = 1  R   ξ  m r   ln w  r   )  −  ( χ  r   + ∑  s = 1  R   χ  r s   ln w  s   + ∑  k = 1  K   ς  k r   ln x  k   + ∑  m = 1  M   ξ  m r   ln v  m   )  = 1       To ensure almost homogeneity of degrees (−1, 1, −1, 1), the following ( 1 + M + K + R )    restrictions must be met: (12) − ∑  k = 1  K   α  k   + ∑  m = 1  M   β  m   − ∑  r = 1  R   χ  r   = 1      (13) − ∑  m = 1  M   δ  k m   + ∑  m = 1  M   β  m n   − ∑  m = 1  M   ξ  m r   = 0      (14) − ∑  k = 1  K   α  k l   + ∑  k = 1  K   δ  k m   − ∑  k = 1  K   ς  k r   = 0      (15) − ∑  r = 1  R   ς  k r   + ∑  r = 1  R   ξ  m r   − ∑  r = 1  R   χ  r s   = 0       Using the almost homogeneity condition Eq. (3)  and choosing the R  th undesirable output for normalizing purposes, ϕ = w  R     , and we obtain: (16) D  E   ( x  w  R     , v w  R   , w  w  R     )  = w  R   ∗ D  E   ( x , v , w )        And Eq. (10)  finally becomes: (17) ln ( w  R   ∗ D  E   )  = α  0   + ∑  k = 1  K   α  k   ln ( x / w  R   )   k i   +  1  2   ∑  k = 1  K   ∑  l = 1  K   α  k l   ln ( x / w  R   )   k i   ln ( x / w  R   )   l i   +  ∑  m = 1  M   β  m   ln ( v w  R   )   m i   + 1  2   ∑  m = 1  M   ∑  n = 1  M   β  m n   ln ( v w  R   )   m i   ln ( v w  R   )   n i   +  ∑  r = 1  R − 1   χ  r   ln ( w / w  R   )   i   +  1  2   ∑  r = 1  R − 1   ∑  s = 1  R − 1   χ  m n   ln ( w / w  R   )   i   ln ( w / w  R   )   i   +  ∑  k = 1  K   ∑  m = 1  M   δ  k m   ln ( x / w  R   )   k i   ln ( v w  R   )   m i   +  ∑  k = 1  K   ∑  r = 1  R − 1   ς  k r   ln ( x / w  R   )   k i   ( w / w  R   )   i   +  ∑  m = 1  M   ∑  r = 1  R − 1   ξ  m r   ln ( v w  R   )   m i   ln ( w / w  R   )   i   , ( i = 1 , 2 , … , N )        Following Eq. (17) , the EHDF for environmental efficiency estimation is as follows: (18) ln ( w  R   ∗ D  E   )  = T ( x  w  R     , v w  R   , w     w  R     ; α , β , χ , δ , ς , ξ )  + v  i t   ln w  R   + ln D  E   = T ( x  w  R     , v w  R   , w     w  R     ; α , β , χ , δ , ς , ξ )  + v  i t   ln w  R   = T ( x  w  R     , v w  R   , w     w  R     ; α , β , χ , δ , ς , ξ )  + v  i t   − ln D  E         For Eq. (18) , − ln D  E      is the term representing the inefficiency in the composed error term structure of SFA. Therefore, we can note u  i t   = − ln D  E     , and Eq. (18)  becomes: (19) ln w  R   = T ( x  w  R     , v w  R   , w  w  R     ; α , β , χ , δ , ς , ξ )  + v  i t   + u  i t         The specific model of Eq. (19)  is next: (20) ln G H G  i t   = α  0   + α  1   ln L  i t   + α  2   ln K  i t  ∗   + α  3   ln F F  i t  ∗   + α  4   ln N F  i t  ∗   +  β  1   ln G D P  i t  ∗   + χ  1   ln P M  i t  ∗   +  α  12   ln L  i t   ln K  i t  ∗   + α  13   ln L  i t   ln F F  i t  ∗   +  α  14   ln L  i t   ln N F  i t  ∗   + α  23   ln K  i t  ∗   ln F F  i t  ∗   +  α  24   ln K  i t  ∗   ln N F  i t  ∗   + α  34   ln F F  i t  ∗   ln N F  i t  ∗   +  δ  11   ln L  i t   ln G D P  i t  ∗   + δ  21   ln K  i t  ∗   ln G D P  i t  ∗   +  δ  31   ln F F  i t  ∗   ln G D P  i t  ∗   + δ  41   ln N F  i t  ∗   ln G D P  i t  ∗   +  ς  11   ln L  i t   ln P M  i t  ∗   + ς  21   ln K  i t  ∗   ln P M  i t  ∗   +  ς  31   ln F F  i t  ∗   ln P M  i t  ∗   + ς  41   ln N F  i t  ∗   ln P M  i t  ∗   +  ξ  11   ln G D P  i t  ∗   ln P M  i t  ∗   + ( 1 / 2 )  α  11   ln L  i t  2   +  ( 1 / 2 )  α  22   ln K  i t  ∗ 2   + ( 1 / 2 )  α  33   ln F F  i t  ∗ 2   +  ( 1 / 2 )  α  44   ln N F  i t  ∗ 2   + ( 1 / 2 )  β  11   ln G D P  i t  ∗ 2   +  ( 1 / 2 )  χ  11   ln P M  i t  ∗ 2   + v  i t   + u  i t      ( K  i t  ∗   = K  i t    G H G  i t     , F F  i t  ∗   = F F  i t    G H G  i t     , N F  i t  ∗   = N F  i t   ⋅ G H G  i t   ,    G D P  i t  ∗   = G D P  i t   ⋅ G H G  i t   , P M  i t  ∗   = P M  i t    G H G  i t     )       GHG i t    , L i t    , K i t    , FF i t    , NF i t    , GDP i t    , and PM i t     are GHG, labor, capital, fossil energy, non-fossil energy, GDP, and PM2.5  for country i   at time t  . In this paper, instead of reducing labor in the production process while improving environmental efficiency, we want to reduce GHG and air pollution gas emissions by converting capital investment and fossil energy to non-fossil energy. So instead of assigning a reduced share to labor, we assign the opposite share to non-fossil energy as capital investment and fossil energy. This would be consistent with the policy requirement for countries to increase investment, reduce fossil energy use, and increase clean energy. For u  i t    , we follow Battese and Coelli (1992)  under a time-varying technical inefficiency framework and as a truncated normal distribution. Then, the GEE can be estimated by: (21) G E E  i t   = exp ( − u  i t   )         3.2 Environmental Technical Gap (ETG) and Meta Environmental Efficiency (MEE) estimation ETG indicates the distance from the optimal group frontier to the meta frontier. MEE can show the relationship between GEE and ETG. Let us set the k  th group estimation function following Eq. (23)  as ln w  R  k      in the above part. Although the true group-k frontier D  E  k   ( ⋅ )     is unknown, its fitted value D  E  k *   ( ⋅ )     can be obtained after estimating Eq. (17) (22) D  E  k   ( x  w  R     , v w  R   , w  w  R     )  = D  E  k ∗   ( x  w  R     , v w  R   , w  w  R     )  + v       Following Huang et al. (2014)  and Honma and Hu (2018) , we maximize environmental efficiency by considering GHG as an undesirable output and only if it is minimized. The actual GHG emission should estimate by: w  R  min   = w  R   × G E E   . Our second stage meta function becomes: (23) ln w  R  min   = T ( x  w  R     , v w  R   , w  w  R     ; α , β , χ , δ , ς , ξ )  + v  i t  ∗   + u  i t  ∗         And then, the ETG becomes as: (24) E T G  i t   = exp ( − u  i t  ∗   )       u  i t  ∗     is also assumed to be a truncated normal distribution by following Battese and Coelli (1992)  as exp ( − η ( t − T )  )    u  i  ∗     . The MEE equals GEE and ETG multiplication. The larger the value of ETG is, the more advanced the environmental technology is adopted by countries of group k  . And we can get: (25) M E E  i t   = G E E  i t   × E T G  i t         By using Eq. (25) , we calculate the MEE in the third step. Fig. 1  shows the relationship between group frontier and meta frontier. The GEE is β  g   ⋅ b  b   = β  g     . And the MEE is β  m   ⋅ b  b   = β  g   ⋅ b  b   ⋅ β  m   ⋅ b  β  g   ⋅ b   = β  m     . The ETG can be shown as M E E  G E E   = β  m   ⋅ b  b    β  g   ⋅ b  b     = β  m    β  g       . A large value of ETG expresses that the group’s efficiency is close to the meta frontier.  Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation is crucial in our SFA analysis due to its consistency and asymptotic normality. As sample sizes increase, ML estimators reliably converge towards true parameter values, enhancing accuracy in large-sample environmental efficiency studies. Additionally, ML facilitates essential hypothesis testing within the SFA framework, ensuring the model accurately distinguishes inefficiency from random noise, thereby validating its appropriateness for our data analysis (Kumbhakar et al., 2020 ).   4 Empirical results 4.1 Data Table 2  describes the variables used in this paper. This paper uses 27 years of panel data from 1992 to 2018 for 163 countries. GDP, population, labor, and capital data are from Penn World Table 10.0. GDP is our desirable output, with data calculated in constant 2017 U.S. dollars. Labor is our inputs, expressed as the number of people employed in each country and capital (constant as 2017 U.S. dollars). Energy consumption data are from the Energy Information Administration of the U.S. This study distinguishes between fossil (coal, natural gas, petroleum, and other liquids) and non-fossil (nuclear, renewables, and others) energy consumption. Fossil energy is the primary source of GHG, so in the model, we hope to reduce GHG emissions by reducing fossil energy consumption. Our undesirable outputs, GHG and PM2.5  emission data are from the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research v6.1. GHG includes carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, and fluorinated gases. This indicator reflects GHG released during economic production.2  2 For more detailed information about GHG data, please visit https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu .   Finally, all data on efficiency determinants are from the World Bank. These include Forest Area, measured as a percentage of land; FDI, as a percentage of GDP; Manufacturing Value Added and Services Value Added, both also expressed as a percentage of GDP; urban population, as a percentage of the total population; and Population Density, expressed as people per square kilometer of land area. Finally, all data on efficiency impact factors are from the World Bank. The data from 163 countries were divided into four groups by income level according to the World Bank (based on 2017 calendar data). Table 3  shows all the information used to calculate efficiency. It is clear that there are significant differences in all variables among the groups, so using the SMFA can help us better evaluate environmental efficiency. We convert the data above to per capita data to avoid the effect of economic size heterogeneity on the measurement of environmental efficiency. Also, to avoid convergence problems, all variables have been divided by their means.     4.2 Efficiency estimation Table 4  presents the ML simultaneous estimates of all the efficiencies using the Stata 17.0 program. The GEE is estimated using Eqs. (23) –(24)  by groups and the results are shown in model 1 to model 4. According to Cuesta et al. (2009) , the ML parameters allow us to determine the effect of the output and inputs on the distance functions. As we can see, most of the results are within the confidence interval. However, due to differences in economic development and environmental technologies, the same inputs and outputs of each group have different effects on the distance to the within-group frontier. GDP can increase the distance to the group frontier in all groups. GDP growth can result in higher emissions of pollutants and GHG and a pullback of countries from the group frontier. Except for the low-income group, the capital stocks of the other three groups reduce the distance between the group’s countries and the frontier. It demonstrates that increasing investment in these three groups will help the country move to the group frontier. Fossil energy use in high-income countries can reduce the distance from the country to the group environmental frontier. This result does not suggest that the use of fossil energy should be increased. Many countries began carbon reduction activities early and are now beginning to see a declining trend in GHG emissions. So, this group shows a trend of using fossil energy while GHG emissions are decreasing. The effect of PM2.5  is insignificant. It is still being determined whether pollutant gas reductions can help to reduce GHG emissions or impede GHG reduction policies.  We perform a hypothesis test to verify whether the hyperbolic SMFA applies. The test is the Likelihood Ratio (LR) test method of Battese et al. (2004)  and Zhang and Wang (2015) , with the specific equation L = − 2 [ L ( H 0 )  − L ( H 1 )  ]    . According to the Zhang and Wang (2015)  method, the value of H0 is the log-likelihood value of pooling regression (model 6), indicating no technical differences between groups. H1 is the sum of the log-likelihood value of the four groups (model 1- model 4). Here, the value of H0 is 5056.475, and the value of H1 is 6109.976, so the value of the LR test is 2107.002. The hypothesis of H0 is rejected at a 1% significance level with a critical value of 145.099 (108 degrees of freedom). So, we adopt the opposite hypothesis that the four groups have technical differences. Table 5  shows the average efficiency scores of each group. The average GEE for the high-income group is 0.750, showing how these countries can improve their environmental performance by decreasing their undesirable outputs and inputs by 25.0% (1−0.750) while simultaneously increasing their desirable outputs by 33.3%. (1/0.750=1.333). It is also necessary to focus on clean energy investments and reduce fossil energy use to increase non-fossil energy consumption by 33.3%. Both the average GEE and ETG are in a stepwise division based on income level. As expected, the high-income countries have higher GEE scores, showing that their governments care about the environment and the superiority of their policies. The final column displays the efficiency values obtained using the pooling SFA method. These values are higher than those calculated by the pooling SFA method, indicating that the pooling method overestimates global environmental performance.  Interestingly, the average ETG score decreases as income level increases. ETG refers to the distance between the environmental level of a given country and the global environmental frontier and does not represent the actual environmental science and technology level gap. The relationship between carbon emissions and economic development is not inverted U-shaped (Arrow et al., 1995 ). Carbon emissions tend to rise with per capita income. Countries can de-link economic growth from carbon emissions, but it is not an automatic consequence of growth (Socolow et al., 1996 ). However, some high-income countries have demonstrated that increasing GDP while reducing emissions is possible, but this progress has not been swift enough. Due to rapid economic growth and high historical carbon emissions, there is still a significant gap in the overall environmental frontier. Mihaela et al. (2022)  show that in 27 E.U. countries, higher income levels increase environmental protection demand. These countries must also develop environmental regulations for emission reduction during economic growth. Based on the efficiency values above and the carbon uptake theory, we made Fig. 2  to show this result better. The three numbers indicate the different developing stages. In the first stage, GHG emissions and air pollution have not yet exceeded self-purification capacity. Most low-income countries are at this stage, and the capacity can handle the current emissions, bringing them closer to the environmental frontier. In the second stage, emissions exceed the self-purification capacity, leading to capacity degradation. Self-purification capacity deterioration could be caused by resource destruction during overshoot. At this point, middle-income countries have significantly neglected environmental concerns while growing their economies. After a period of overshoot, in the third stage, high-income countries create strategies to lessen the environmental issues produced by excessive emissions. We examine three scenarios of capacity growth. Line B (desirable capacity) is the most desirable direction in which the country may restore and expand its original capacity through technology and regulations. Line C (current capacity) depicts the situation in high-income countries, where environmental efficiency is being improved through policies and technology but is not achieving the desired goal and is still far from the environmental frontier. The D (worst capacity) line is the worst direction. If we do not take action to continue promoting economic expansion at the expense of environmental harm, it will result in more severe consequences. We believe that the low ETG scores of high-income countries result from their desire to mitigate the environmental damage caused by overshoot through technology and policy, but their inability to restore the original self-purification capacity. In other words, they cannot compensate for the consequences of developing their economies at the expense of the environment. Most high-income countries’ current situation falls between lines C and D, resulting in a lower average ETG score.  Aside from the input and output indicators, national environment performance is influenced by various factors. We selected several variables that can affect both GEE and ETG. These variables can help provide recommendations for improving efficiency and reducing the distance to the environmental frontier. We employ a panel Tobit model to investigate the factors influencing the GEE and analyze the underlying reasons for the issues presented. The formula of the panel Tobit model is as follows: (26) G E E  i t   or E T G  i t   = α  i t   + β  j   X  i t   + v  i   + ɛ  i t        where X  i t     denotes the value of the i  th indicator affecting environmental performance in t  th year. The dependent variable is GEE  i t     or ETG  i t     value for the i  th country in the t  th year.β   is the regression coefficient, v  i     is the panel-level standard error term which is distributed as i i d ∼ N ( 0 , σ  ϑ  2   )     and ɛ   is the random disturbance term which is distributed as i i d ∼ N ( 0 , σ  ɛ  2   )    . The regression model of this paper is as follows: (27) G E E  i t   o r E T G  i t   = α + β  1   F A  i t   + β  2   F D I  i t   + β  3   M V A  i t       +  β  4   S V A  i t   + β  5   P D  i t   + β  6   U P  i t   + v  i   + ɛ  i t        where the FA i t    , FDI i t    , MVA i t    , SVA i t    , PD i t    , and UP i t    , represent the value of forest area, foreign direct investment, manufacturing value-added, services value-added, population density, and urban population for country i   at time t  , respectively. Table 6  presents the estimation results for the Tobit model. The dependent variable of model 7 - model 10 is GEE, and model 11’s dependent variable is ETG. ρ = σ  ϑ  2   / ( σ  ɛ  2   + σ  ϑ  2   )     is near 1 in all four groups, which suggests that the panel-level term is essential, and the panel Tobit regression differs from the pooled regression. Afforestation and reforestation techniques can effectively reduce carbon dioxide emissions (Chiquier et al., 2022 ), which improves environmental efficiency in high-income countries. Many other countries increase their GDP by utilizing forestry resources. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, approximately 1.2 billion hectares of forests are used for timber and non-timber forest products. Over-dependence on natural resources reduces environmental efficiency (Fan et al., 2022 ). Moreover, this consumption of forest resources will significantly reduce the absorption of GHG, increasing the gap between the country and the overall environmental frontier.  Moreover, except for high-income countries, FDI brings high environmental technology to three groups, increasing the GEE of the other three groups. The results of model 11 also show that an increase in FDI raises ETG scores, implying that FDI has a halo effect on environmental performance. Furthermore, industry structure has a significant impact on environmental efficiency. Manufacturing tends to worsen the environmental efficiency of the group and increase the distance from countries to the overall environmental frontier, while services have the opposite result of manufacturing. Furthermore, the positive sign of PD and UP implies that higher population density and urbanization levels can improve environmental performance due to the highly integrated use of resources and energy. We selected the above six factors as the influencing factors of GEE and ETG, which have approximately the same effect on these efficiency values. Because many factors influence environmental issues, we do not distinguish between GEE-specific and ETG-specific determinants. We believe these six factors can influence the distance between countries to the group environmental frontier and between countries to the overall environmental frontier. The third column of the previous Table 5  displays the mean of MEE for each group. We can see that the average MEE values for each group are nearly identical. Fig. 3 (A) shows a boxplot comparing GEE, ETG, and MEE distribution characteristics. The GEE value of each income group varies significantly, and there are multiple outliers for each efficiency value. As MEE scores are the values obtained by multiplying GEE and ETG, MEE values obtained by multiplying high GEE and low ETG or low GEE and high ETG are nearly identical. The SMFA has the advantage of considering the heterogeneity of environmental efficiency across groups. It assumes that different groups have different environmental characteristics and countries within the group have similar characteristics. We mentioned that high-income countries have made significant efforts to improve the environment. Numerous European countries began reducing their emissions in 1990 and have made substantial progress. Raw data show that certain countries have drastically reduced their GHG emissions. Moreover, there are still high-income countries whose emissions are still increasing rapidly. This indicates that income level is insufficient for classifying environmental performance. In other words, there are significant differences in environmental performance across income-level groups, and we should pay more attention to this heterogeneity. Therefore, we regrouped 163 countries and combined them with income levels to account for environmental differences across countries.  Zhang et al. (2020b)  and Kang and Kang (2022)  used a mean–variance classification method to reclassify countries as mature, promising, struggling, or sluggish. This method uses mean values and variance values as the criterion to divide all countries into four groups. In this paper, we calculated three kinds of efficiency scores. Using only one of the efficiency scores to regroup countries fails to reveal the characteristics of the three efficiency values. We will use the cluster analysis method to reclassify these countries into four groups based on the three indicators: GEE, ETG, and MEE. Hastie et al. (2009)  proposed that cluster analysis, specifically using the k-means algorithm, can categorize individuals based on their characteristics. This approach aims to achieve maximum homogeneity within each category or cluster while maximizing heterogeneity between different types. The iterative nature of the k-means algorithm ensures that the group centers and assignments are refined in each iteration until a stable clustering solution is obtained. The algorithm aims to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares, equivalent to maximizing cluster homogeneity. Additionally, by choosing appropriate initial group centers and an optimal number of clusters, k-means can effectively achieve heterogeneity between different clusters. Fig. 3 (B) compares the gap between and within groups with Fig. 3 (A). We can see that after regrouping, the variance within the group declines, and the difference between the groups increases significantly. We reclassified the 163 countries into heartening, tolerable, inactive, and prudent groups according to the characteristics of each group. The number of countries in each income group in the new classification is shown in Table 7 . All four income groups are displayed in the new subgroups. The high-income group has better environmental performance overall, but five countries are also inactive. Most countries with low incomes are in the prudent group, but there are also countries in the heartening group.  We can also see from Fig. 3 (B) that the heartening group is the high GEE value group, consisting of high-income and upper-middle-income countries with self-management solid capabilities. It can quickly close the gap to the meta frontier after restoring its environmental self-purification capabilities. Low- and middle-income countries in this group can also rapidly reach the frontier through foreign investment and acquiring advanced environmental technologies. The tolerable group has the second-highest average GEE and slightly lower MEE. These countries pay less attention to the environment than the first group. They have the potential to catch up with the first group after increasing their management efforts and paying attention to environmental issues. The inactive group has more severe problems and lower GEE values, indicating that these countries do not recognize the gravity of environmental problems and lack supporting environmental policies to address them, resulting in the most severe overall environmental problems. Finally, the prudent group has the highest ETG. Most of the prudent countries belong to the low-income group. Combining the self-purification theory and the GEE values of low-income countries in Table 7 , it is clear that prudent countries pay little attention to environmental issues. As we can see in Fig. 2 , due to the slow economic development of most countries, self-purification capacity can solve the existing GHG emission problems. This results in high ETG values for these countries, indicating they are closer to the environmental frontier. They are referred to as “prudent” because they need to worry about their environmental status and the harm to their self-purification capacity. Clustering and income-based classification provide mutual complementarity and description for studying countries with diverse environmental and technological characteristics.   5 Discussion We addressed the questions outlined in the introduction and literature review part. We have analyzed global environmental efficiency trends over 27 years, revealing significant but uneven progress across countries. Our results shows that developed countries, despite their advancements, have not yet to reach the environmental frontier uniformly, challenging the assumption that economic advancement equates to environmental efficiency. Additionally, we have identified various factors influencing environmental efficiency. Our empirical findings not only highlight significant variations in environmental efficiency across different income and development groups but also challenge the conventional wisdom that income level alone can predict environmental policy success. Advanced countries, often seen as leaders in environmental management, need to achieve superior environmental outcomes uniformly. For instance, while the U.S., Germany, and France, categorized as ‘heartening’, have implemented robust environmental policies and embraced carbon-neutral technologies early, they have yet to reach the environmental frontiers anticipated. This discrepancy suggests a complex interplay between historical industrial practices and modern sustainability efforts. It underscores the ongoing need for policy innovation, even in developed nations, pointing to an essential insight that past industrial advantages may complicate current transitions to sustainability. Rwanda serves as a compelling counterexample, demonstrating that effective environmental governance can indeed transcend economic barriers. Despite its economic constraints, Rwanda’s prioritization of environmental protection highlights the potential for policy efficiency even with limited resources. This case challenges the narrative that economic prosperity is a prerequisite for environmental sustainability, suggesting instead that strategic policy focus and governance quality are equally important. The experiences of countries in the ‘tolerable’ group, such as Japan, South Korea, and Australia, further complicate the picture. These countries need help with the delayed implementation of carbon neutrality plans and the setting of overly ambitious targets. This scenario reflects a broader pattern where the success of environmental policies is contingent not just on the policies themselves but also on their timing and realism. This indicates a need for environmental strategies that are not only well-structured but also realistically tailored to each country’s unique capacities and circumstances. Conversely, Russia and China illustrate the spectrum of challenges faced by countries at varying stages of environmental and economic strategy development. Russia, as an ‘inactive’ country, struggles with reducing its dependence on fossil fuels—a significant challenge given its heavy industrial base and the current state of technology. China, categorized as ‘prudent’, grapples with the environmental costs of its rapid economic growth over the past three decades. As the world’s leading emitter of GHGs, China’s situation exemplifies the intricate balance required between economic growth and environmental sustainability. These cases are emblematic of broader global challenges where historical economic advantages and growth trajectories impose unique burdens and create specific opportunities for environmental policy.  6 Conclusion The primary motivation for this study stems from an urgent need to explore and understand the environmental efficiency of countries and regions worldwide, especially amidst the rapidly evolving global environmental landscape and escalating economic pressures. Environmental challenges such as climate change, air pollution, and biodiversity loss threaten societies and economies globally. These issues’ severity prompted our use of enhanced hyperbolic and metafrontier methods, employing GHG and PM2.5  emissions as benchmarks, to assess the environmental efficiency of 163 countries and regions over the past 27 years. On the positive side, our study found a gradual improvement in global environmental efficiency over the last 27 years, signifying some success worldwide in enhancing environmental protection and efficiency. Certain countries and regions have shown significant strides in implementing effective environmental improvement measures, serving as viable models for others. However, the study also reveals some concerning negatives. Despite overall progress, the average level of environmental efficiency remains low in many countries, indicating that substantial challenges still exist globally in achieving environmental sustainability. More worrying is that developed countries, historically characterized by high GHG emissions and heavy reliance on fossil fuels, generally exhibit lower environmental efficiency. This finding suggests that even economically advanced nations need fundamental changes in their environmental technologies and policy-making approaches. Collaborative development involves cooperation between countries, regions, or income levels to achieve common SDGs. Through our empirical findings, several crucial collaborative development aspects emerge: Firstly, in response to the gradual improvement in global environmental efficiency yet persistently low average levels, we recommend strengthening environmental regulations and standards globally. Establishing more stringent global environmental policies through international cooperation is crucial. This effort could be coordinated by global platforms like the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, aiming to set higher standards and encourage countries to adopt more effective environmental policies. Secondly, considering the lower environmental efficiency observed in developed countries with high historical GHG emissions, a reevaluation and potential reform of environmental practices in these countries are suggested. This could include more significant investments in renewable energy, enhancing energy efficiency in various sectors, and adopting more sustainable industrial practices. Additionally, these countries must lead the development and dissemination of carbon-neutral technologies. Thirdly, the finding that the current level of environmental technology is inadequate in addressing environmental issues suggests a policy shift towards significant investment in research and development in environmental technologies. This investment should focus on innovations that reduce emissions and promote overall sustainable development. Fourthly, it is necessary to address the consistent influence of factors like industrial structure, urbanization, and population size on environmental efficiency. Policies should be developed to encourage cleaner production processes, sustainable urban planning, and population policies mindful of environmental impacts. Fifthly, enhancing natural ecosystems’ self-purification capacity is essential. Policies that protect and improve natural ecosystems, such as forests and wetlands, can contribute significantly to a country’s environmental efficiency. These policies might include initiatives for forest conservation, wetland restoration, and biodiversity protection. Lastly, k-means cluster analysis highlights the effectiveness of tailoring environmental policies to different country groups’ specific characteristics and needs. This approach can lead to more targeted and effective environmental policies, acknowledging the unique circumstances of each country or group of countries. Our study recognizes that grouping countries by income level may not capture all environmental efficiency factors. Geographical and climatic factors also play a crucial role and could be better addressed in future research through more comprehensive models. This acknowledges the complexity of environmental efficiency and underscores the need for continued, nuanced research in this area.
