                  The transition to renewable energy in the US, vital for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 7 and 13, faces economic obstacles, leaving a knowledge gap regarding potential innovative solutions to accelerate this shift. Simultaneously, the energy-intensive nature of blockchain applications like bitcoin mining is a cause for climate concerns. This work addresses the previously unanswered research question of whether bitcoin mining can be strategically used to harness surplus renewable energy from forthcoming clean energy installations, bridging the gap between economic viability and SDGs. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive analysis, comparing the economic returns of bitcoin mining with three alternative chemical-based energy storage systems, including hydrogen, ammonia, and methanol, all powered by planned renewable sources. Mixed-integer linear programs were formulated to determine the maximum profits that can be obtained based on power utilization from planned renewable installations using varying alternatives. Results suggest that bitcoin mining is profitable in 80 out of 83 examined planned installations, generating a maximum profit of $7.68 million and harnessing 62% of the available renewable energy. Therefore, integrating bitcoin mining with planned renewable installations offers a dual solution of bolstering investments in the renewable energy sector while addressing climate concerns associated with conventional mining operations.

Handling editor: Cecilia Maria Villas BÃ´as de Almeida The transition to renewable energy in the US, vital for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 7 and 13, faces economic obstacles, leaving a knowledge gap regarding potential innovative solutions to accelerate this shift. Simultaneously, the energy-intensive nature of blockchain applications like bitcoin mining is a cause for climate concerns. This work addresses the previously unanswered research question of whether bitcoin mining can be strategically used to harness surplus renewable energy from forthcoming clean energy installations, bridging the gap between economic viability and SDGs. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive analysis, comparing the economic returns of bitcoin mining with three alternative chemical-based energy storage systems, including hydrogen, ammonia, and methanol, all powered by planned renewable sources. Mixed-integer linear programs were formulated to determine the maximum profits that can be obtained based on power utilization from planned renewable installations using varying alternatives. Results suggest that bitcoin mining is profitable in 80 out of 83 examined planned installations, generating a maximum profit of $7.68 million and harnessing 62% of the available renewable energy. Therefore, integrating bitcoin mining with planned renewable installations offers a dual solution of bolstering investments in the renewable energy sector while addressing climate concerns associated with conventional mining operations.

The Paris Agreement brought together 196 member countries to merge their efforts to achieve committed carbon reductions (Glanemann et al., 2020 ). It is well known that excessive reliance on fossil fuels is a significant contributor to local air pollution, with emissions such as carbon dioxide (CO2 ), among other greenhouse gases (HÃ¶Ã¶k and Tang, 2013 ; Johnsson et al., 2019 ). Countries like the US, China, and Germany focus on investing in renewable infrastructure to replace conventional power sources to bolster their climate change mitigation efforts (Chen et al., 2022 ; Chiu, 2022 ; Hall, 2022 ; Min, 2022 ; Steitz, 2021 ; Wehrmann, 2022 ). Numerous countries provide incentives to support renewable energy generation and drive the shift to a greener energy future. (Kim et al., 2014 ). Although governments persistently work to boost the establishment of renewable energy infrastructures, significant operational challenges and investment risk hurdles, both pre and post-commercial operations, hinder the rapid adoption of renewable energy. The recent developments in the blockchain industry, especially grid-powered cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, have further exasperated the situation. Numerous studies have critiqued bitcoin mining's immense energy use and consequential carbon footprint (Jiang et al., 2021 ; Kohler and Pizzol, 2019 ; Krause and Tolaymat, 2018 ; Roeck and Drennen, 2022 ; Stoll et al., 2019 ). Notably, annual carbon emissions attributed to bitcoin can be equated to entire countries, such as Cuba (Digiconomist, 2018 ). Similarly, it has been posited that bitcoin mining might significantly exacerbate global warming trends (Mora et al., 2018 ). Yet, in light of these challenges and grounded in Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) directives, this work seeks to evaluate whether bitcoin mining, rather than being a climate liability, can be harnessed innovatively to bolster the economic benefits of planned renewable installations in the US. The primary objective is to provide evidence-based insights that can inform energy policy regulations, aligning them with SDG goals and aiding the crucial transition to a sustainable energy framework. Specifically, exploring the viability of using bitcoin mining during periods when these installations operate below their nameplate capacity could serve as a decisive factor in identifying optimal locations as economic hotspots for future investments in renewable installations. The anticipated growth of renewable energy capacity faces obstacles such as substantial capital costs and the intermittent nature of renewable power sources, which are significant barriers to its role in providing cost-effective electricity. Even with increased renewable capacity, a lack of appropriate energy storage options results in substantial renewable energy curtailments. Since proposed renewable energy projects are frequently posed with substantial financial risks for investors, it is imperative for governments to establish targeted measures to promote clean energy installations (Bastian-Pinto et al., 2021 ). Every renewable power generation setup undergoes a period before grid connection, which includes obtaining and finalizing regulatory permissions. Currently, a particular setup doesn't yield any income prior to its commercial operation, even if it can produce energy below its designated capacity. Across the US, 26,316Â MW of planned renewable power installations have either been completed (but not yet in commercial operation) or are in various intermediate stages. This data suggests a significant opportunity to convert renewable energy into profits before these installations export power to the grid. Fig. 1   illustrates the distribution of these planned solar and wind installations across US states, while Fig. 2   provides a state-wide summary of upcoming renewable energy projects. The concept of renewable-powered bitcoin mining has emerged as a potential solution to the massive emissions associated with traditional mining operations (Bastian-Pinto et al., 2021 ; Niaz et al., 2022 ). However, the cost-intensive nature of this renewable infrastructure prompts the research question of whether we can derive additional economic benefits from these upcoming renewable energy projects when paired with bitcoin mining. Specifically, this work fills a notable gap in the current academic landscape. We assess the feasibility of using blockchain applications as a mechanism to hedge profits from planned renewable installations spread across 83 US counties before they supply power to the grid, a strategy that could counterbalance the significant economic risks borne by investors. The absence of energy-efficient storage options is one of the critical reasons that renewable energy projects are not used before grid integration at lesser than nameplate capacity. Batteries with suitable characteristics, including high charge or discharge efficiency, low self-charge, and long cycle life, have been employed as energy storage options, particularly for photovoltaic systems (Ould Amrouche et al., 2016 ). These offer benefits like durability and technological sophistication. However, the high costs and lack of ability to supply power for seasonal and grid-scale demand are barriers to widespread application (Hasan et al., 2021 ). Accordingly, it is crucial to note that transitioning from a fossil-dependent global energy market to a renewable-based one requires a highly effective method for storing and transporting an appropriate energy carrier (Schorn et al., 2021 ). Therefore, besides blockchain applications like bitcoin mining, we explore three chemical energy storage alternatives, specifically hydrogen, ammonia, and methanol, to utilize economic advantages from upcoming renewable energy projects. A combination of electrolyzer, hydrogen storage tank, and fuel cell can be employed for surplus energy storage and subsequent use during an electrical energy shortage. Green hydrogen has a very low volumetric energy density even in the liquid state under cryogenic conditions although it emerged as the foundation for chemical-based energy storage options (Salmon and BaÃ±ares-AlcÃ¡ntara, 2021 ). Accordingly, various chemical derivatives which are more portable, have been examined over the years to mainly attain transport cost reductions. Ammonia is the second most produced chemical globally, primarily employed to produce nitrogen fertilizer (Giddey et al., 2017 ). Thus, ammonia has well-established global transport routes, besides the added advantage that it can be stored at relatively mild conditions when compared with liquid hydrogen. Despite these advantages, under most circumstances, the high cost of producing energy from ammonia is the major limitation in its universal adoption as an energy vector (Salmon and BaÃ±ares-AlcÃ¡ntara, 2021 ). However, methanol is extensively employed as a liquid organic hydrogen carrier with the similar benefit of shipping and storage under ambient conditions. These carriers frequently have low volumetric hydrogen density and higher capital costs (Hank et al., 2020 ; Wijayanta et al., 2019 ). Understandably, the economic viability of employing methanol as an energy carrier depends on the CO2  stream's availability, which, if unavailable, makes using direct air capture (DAC) very expensive (Hank et al., 2020 ). A rigorous analysis is required to assess the potential economic advantages extracted from upcoming renewable energy projects in various states in the US employing either blockchain applications or appropriate energy storage options. Even though planned installations will operate below nameplate capacity during this period, hedging additional profits will decrease the economic risks from an investor's point of view. Furthermore, the potential economic advantages can be a determining factor for selecting the location of future investments in the renewable energy sector. The key novelties and findings of this work can be summarized as follows:â¢ The most comprehensive evaluation of blockchain applications as an alternative to hedge economic benefits from upcoming solar and wind energy projects in the US prior to grid integration.  â¢ Detailed comparative analysis among three chemical-based energy storage alternatives and bitcoin mining as an option to harness the potential power from forthcoming installations.  â¢ A holistic optimization modeling framework that integrates the operation of renewable energy projects with the decision-making process for investing in digital currency mining or energy storage alternatives to identify economic hotspots for future renewable power investments.  â¢ In this study, among the 83 planned renewable installations examined and the bitcoin scenario, MichiganâMeridian Wind Park was discovered to have the highest profit of $7.68Â M with a 62% usage of available power to mine bitcoins.  â¢ A weak correlation was observed between the percentage of power usage to mine bitcoins and the potential profit, which is why, despite a usage rate of 34%, the Oklahoma-Traverse Wind Project had the second-highest profit of $4.08Â M.  â¢ Using ammonia as an energy storage scenario was relatively less profitable than bitcoin and hydrogen. The most profitable facility for the ammonia scenario was 39.14% less than the most profitable facility based on bitcoin mining.  â¢ The methanol scenario was deemed unprofitable for nine planned renewable installation sites, whereas 15 sites were discovered with a profit lower than $100,000. Low profits for the methanol scenario are particularly owing to the high investment required for the CO2  capture process.    The findings of this study show that bitcoin mining can be used as an efficient alternative to extract added profits from various planned renewable energy facilities in the US. Depending upon the total energy available from a given facility and the investments in equipment required, chemical-based energy storage options can also be profitable apart from bitcoin. The policy implications of this study can be summarized as follows:â¢ Climate goals: Blockchain applications as a profitable alternative to using power from planned renewable installations can enhance the progress to attain the net-zero emissions targets, suggesting that more flexible decarbonization approaches incorporating cryptocurrency mining can be implemented.  â¢ Crypto-asset policy: Environmentally sustainable bitcoin mining using clean energy sources like planned wind and solar installations should be incentivized to decouple the current energy-intensive bitcoin miners and fossil-dependent grids, therefore stagnating the steadily rising associated carbon debt.  â¢ Science and Technology policy: Technical innovation in producing chemical-based energy storage alternatives, like an increase in equipment efficiency or cost-competitiveness of modular manufacturing units, would allow more planned renewable facilities to hedge into profits based on using these alternatives.    1.1 SDG projects At the Rio+20 United Nations (UN) Summit in 2012, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were introduced, encapsulating a set of measurable targets requiring extensive global cooperation (GusmÃ£o Caiado et al., 2018 ). These SDGs are formulated into a framework consisting of 17 goals, accompanied by 169 targets to present a transformative action plan to address significant environmental, social, and economic challenges faced by society (Aly et al., 2022 ; Coscieme et al., 2020 ). Achieving the UN's 2030 targets within this framework demands a collaborative commitment from countries worldwide (Nundy et al., 2021 ). Recent research has explored the intersections between SDGs and various subjects, such as food waste reduction and waste management in the built environment (Garcia et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2023 ). Accordingly, as we seek to bridge the gap between these overarching objectives and localized real-world agendas, there's a crucial need for scientific guidance. Such guidance is essential to derive solutions for intricate issues and to inform policy-making decisions (Giannetti et al., 2020 ). In the realm of energy, there's a noticeable surge in interest from policymakers aiming to harmonize energy policies with the broader SDGs. A significant emphasis is being given to transitioning from conventional energy sources to renewable installations, like solar and wind power (Gyimah et al., 2023 ). These energy sources offer more than environmental benefits; they also help make energy access more widespread. This matches the aims of SDG 7, which supports making energy affordable and available to everyone (Navarrete et al., 2020 ). Along similar lines, the intersection between sustainability and digitalization holds unexplored opportunities for sustainable transformation across sectors (Del RÃ­o Castro et al., 2021 ). The increasing relevance of cross-sectoral policy-making decisions is evident, emphasizing the importance of a multi-faceted approach. For example, we assess blockchain applications as an unconventional strategy to bolster the economic viability of upcoming renewable energy projects. A paradigmatic shift in energy policy discourse, moving from mere resource optimization to a more holistic and sustainable approach complemented by global cooperation, could be critical in realizing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development targets.   2 Methods In this work, the optimization modeling frameworks maximize the profits across different scenarios applied to all renewable energy projects considered in the study. The profits for each scenario are calculated based on the total income throughout the project's duration and the associated costs incurred in that period. The project's total revenue (REV ) is derived from summing up the revenue at each hourly interval, represented as follows:(1) R E V = â t = 1  T  P R O D U C T t      where P R O D U C T t     denotes the revenue in different hourly intervals for the considered scenarios, and T  defines the total intervals. The complete load balance for the available power can be illustrated by Eq. (2) , where P t  AVAIL  , P t  UTL  , and P t  Surplus   refer to the total available energy, utilized energy, and surplus energy in different time intervals. The total utilization (UTL ) for the available power can be estimated using Eq. (3) . The complete list of abbreviations used in the optimization modeling frameworks for hydrogen, ammonia, and methanol scenarios is shown in Table A1 .(2) P t A V A I L   = P t U T L   + P t S u r p l u s       (3) U T L = â t = 1  T  P t U T L    â t = 1  T  P t A V A I L          2.1 Bitcoin scenario In this work, we utilize a similar methodology as illustrated in a previous study to evaluate the potential of blockchain applications like bitcoin mining to harness economic potential from renewable energy projects (Lal et al., 2023 ). Interested readers can refer to this study for further details. Forming an extension of the previous work, we apply the methodology to a more comprehensive list of planned renewable installations spread across the US and present a comparative analysis with other investigated chemical-based scenarios. While evaluating the bitcoin scenario, we first estimate the revenue generation in different time intervals as depicted in Eq. (1) . The revenue generated from bitcoin mining operations is predominantly influenced by factors such as the prevailing price of bitcoin, the reward yielded per mined block, the mining hardware's hash rate, the duration of mining, and the network difficulty, which embodies the computational challenges faced during transaction verification and block addition to the blockchain (Niaz et al., 2022 ). Subsequently, we capture the energy dynamics of bitcoin mining where the utilized component of the total available power, as shown in Eq. (2) , is distributed among the mining hardware and the associated auxiliary equipment. The constraints on power balance are crucial for the optimal sizing of the equipment based on the surplus and utilized power components to ensure the computational and electrical demands of the mining process are fulfilled. It is equally important to consider the heat generation from the mining hardware. The required heat removal rate from the mining equipment necessitates constraints linking the total power consumed and subsequent heat generation. Consequently, we consider heat pumps as part of the auxiliary equipment for heat removal. This work defines the heat removal rate using heat pumps based on the associated parameters (coefficient of performance). Apart from the total power utilized, the individual capacities for the mining hardware and the heat pumps also impact the optimal sizing of the equipment. Lastly, we consider the economic constraints to evaluate the costs associated with the process of using blockchain applications like bitcoin with renewable energy projects. These include constraints defining capital and operational expenditures for both the mining equipment and heat pumps. The required parameters include the unit capital costs, operation & maintenance costs, and the depreciation factors. The detailed optimization modeling framework for the bitcoin scenario has been added in the Supplementary Information.  2.2 Hydrogen scenario In this work, Eq. (4)  represents the power distribution used in the hydrogen scenario.(4) P t U T L   = P t E L E   + P t S t o r a g e       where P t E L E      and P t S t o r a g e      refer to the power used by the electrolyzer units and power required for storing the hydrogen. Now, based on the power component utilized in the electrolyzer, the hydrogen produced (H 2 t  E L E     ) is estimated using Eq. (5) .(5) H 2 t  E L E   = P t E L E   â Î· E L E    L H V       where Î· E L E      denotes the electrolyzer's efficiency. However, using the number of electrolyzers, the total power utilized in the electrolyzer unit must follow the equations:(6) N E L E   â P MIN E L E   â¤ P t E L E   â¤ N E L E   â P MAX E L E       where N E L E      represents the number of electrolyzer units in the facility, P MAX E L E      and P MIN E L E      denote the maximum and minimum power levels in the electrolyzer. Using the selling price of hydrogen (H 2 S P     ), the revenue generated can be calculated as follows:(7) R E V E N U E H 2   = â t = 1  T  H 2 S P   â H 2 t  E L E        The energy used in storing the produced hydrogen is contingent on the quantity during a specific time interval. Thus, Eq. (8)  determines the storage power using the hourly data of hydrogen output from the electrolyzer.(8) P t S t o r a g e   = P H T A N K   â H 2 t  E L E       where P H T A N K      is the coefficient representing the energy used to store the produced hydrogen. The total capital expenditure (CAPEX H2  ) consists of the combined cost of the electrolyzer (C E L E     ) and storage units (C H T A N K     ). Using the optimal number of units of electrolyzer, the capital expenditure can be calculated as follows:(9) C A P E X H 2   = C E L E   + C H T A N K       (10) C E L E   = N E L E   â A C E L E       where A C E L E      represents the capital cost of each electrolyzer. The complete capital cost for hydrogen storage can be derived by applying a specific percentage (Ï S t o r a g e . F r a c     ) of the capital expenditure on the electrolyzers. Therefore, C H T A N K      is estimated as follows:(11) C H T A N K   = Ï S t o r a g e . F r a c   â C E L E        Considering the entire lifespan of the electrolyzer and storage units, the salvage value for both can be determined using the double declining depreciation method, as shown in Eq. (12)â(14) . Using these values, the total salvage value (SAL ) can be obtained at the end of project life.(12) S A L E L E   = D D E L E   â C E L E       (13) S A L H T A N K   = D D H T A N K   â C H T A N K       (14) S A L = S A L E L E   + S A L H T A N K       where S A L E L E      and S A L H T A N K      represent the respective salvage values for the electrolyzer and hydrogen storage tanks, D D E L E      and D D H T A N K      are the respective depreciation factors. The operating expenses (O P E X E L E     ) accumulate from the operation costs of the electrolyzer across all the periods. Eq. (16)  computes the operational costs for each specific time interval as follows (Niaz et al., 2022 ).(15) O P E X E L E   = â t = 1  T  O & M t E L E       (16) O & M t E L E   = H 2 t  E L E   â ( f w  â Ï w  + f K O H   â Ï K O H   + f N 2   â Ï N 2   + f S  â Ï S   )       The fixed cost for the facility primarily equates to the fixed cost for the operational electrolyzer units (F C E L E     ), which can be calculated as below, where C F C . E L E      is the fixed cost of the electrolyzer ($/MW.yr) and N Y    represents the project life.(17) F C E L E   = N E L E   â C F C . E L E   â P MAX E L E   â N Y       2.3 Ammonia scenario Ammonia plays a pivotal role in the production of fertilizers, and its global yearly demand is forecasted to increase significantly in the upcoming years (Apodaca, 2022 ). Due to its superior energy density and comparatively straightforward storage and transport than hydrogen, it is considered an alternate energy carrier (Giddey et al., 2017 ; Hank et al., 2020 ). The nitrogen (N2 ) essential for ammonia production is sourced from a cryogenic air separation unit (ASU). Consequently, ammonia can be synthesized using the Haber-Bosch (HB) process. This work evaluates the ammonia scenario, where the configuration demands energy in three main stages: the electrolyzer's hydrogen production, nitrogen extraction in the ASU, and the combination of hydrogen and nitrogen within the HB cycle. Therefore, Eq. (18)  describes the load balance in the ammonia scenario.(18) P t N H 3    = P t A S U   + P t E L E   + P t M o d u l a r . N H 3        where P t A S U      and P t M o d u l a r . N H 3       denote the energy used in the ASU and modular ammonia manufacturing unit, respectively. Considering the green ammonia price (N H 3  S P     ), the revenue in each time interval can be calculated as follows:(19) R E V E N U E N H 3    = N H 3  S P   â N H 3  t      where N H 3  t     denotes the production rate of ammonia in different time periods. Eq. (20)  calculates the amount of ammonia produced using the power given to the modular manufacturing unit.(20) N H 3  t  = P t M o d u l a r . N H 3    â Î± N H 3       where Î± NH3   signifies the conversion coefficient linking the energy usage in the modular unit to the rate of ammonia production. Using comparable coefficients from existing literature (Î² NH3  , Î© NH3  ) to convert the energy consumption into production rates in the electrolyzer and the ASU, we can get the amount of hydrogen and nitrogen required using Eqs. (21) and (22) .(21) H 2 t  N H 3    = P t E L E   â Î² N H 3       (22) N 2  t N H 3    = P t A S U   â Î© N H 3        The allocation of the total energy usage among the electrolyzer, ASU, and manufacturing unit depends on their individual proportions in the ammonia production process ( Î¼ 1 N H 3     ; Î¼ 2 N H 3     ; Î¼ 3 N H 3     ) .(23) P t E L E   = P t U T L   â Î¼ 1 N H 3       (24) P t A S U   = P t U T L   â Î¼ 2 N H 3       (25) P t M o d u l a r . N H 3    = P t U T L   â Î¼ 3 N H 3        However, there are limits to the total power consumed in these three pieces of equipment based on the number of units (N E L E     , N A S U     ,  and N M o d u l a r . N H 3      ) utilized and the individual capacities for the units as described in the following equations:(26) N E L E   â P MIN E L E   â¤ P t E L E   â¤ N E L E   â P MAX E L E       (27) N A S U   â P MIN A S U   â¤ P t A S U   â¤ N A S U   â P MAX A S U       (28) N M o d u l a r .

N H 3        where P MAX E L E     , P MAX A S U     ,  and P MAX M o d u l a r . N H 3       denote the maximum power consumption of the individual equipment utilized and P MIN E L E     , P MIN A S U     ,  and P MIN M o d u l a r . N H 3       denote the lower limits for respective equipment. The total capital expenditure (C A P E X N H 3      ) is the summation of capital expenditure on the electrolyzer (C E L E     ), ASU (C A S U     ), and the modular units for ammonia production (C M o d u l a r . N H 3      ). Using the number of units of electrolyzer (N E L E     ), ASU (N A S U     ), and the modular units of ammonia manufacturing (N M o d u l a r . N H 3      ) the capital expenditure can be calculated as follows:(29) C A P E X N H 3    = C E L E   + C A S U   + C M o d u l a r . N H 3        (30) C E L E   = N E L E   â A C E L E       (31) C A S U   = N A S U   â A C A S U       (32) C M o d u l a r . N H 3    = N M o d u l a r . N H 3    â A C M o d u l a r . N H 3        where A C E L E     , A C A S U     ,  and A C M o d u l a r . N H 3       represent the capital cost of each electrolyzer, ASU, and modular ammonia manufacturing unit. Considering the total lifespan of the utilized equipment, the salvage value can be determined using the double-declining depreciation method. Using these values, the total salvage value for the ammonia scenario can be obtained.(33) S A L E L E   = D D E L E   â C E L E       (34) S A L A S U   = D D A S U   â C A S U       (35) S A L M o d u l a r .

N H 3       are the factors based on the double declining depreciation method for the electrolyzer, ASU, and the modular ammonia manufacturing unit, respectively. In this work, the aggregate operating expenses for the ammonia scenario (O & M N H 3      ) include the electrolyzer's operating cost and the storage cost for the produced hydrogen and ammonia. Eq. (37)  is used to estimate the operating costs in each time interval. The cost of storing the produced hydrogen (O & M t H T A N K     ) by the electrolyzer unit can be derived using the storage cost per unit (C f H T A N K     ). Similarly, the cost to store ammonia (O & M t N H 3  . T A N K     ) is calculated from the quantity of ammonia produced in that interval and its per unit storage cost (C N H 3  . T A N K     ).(37) O & M N H 3    = â t = 1  T  ( O & M t E L E   + O & M t H T A N K   + O & M t N H 3  .

T A N K         2.4 Methanol scenario Methanol is considered a crucial alternative for energy carriers owing to its extensive application, the potential to derive numerous secondary products, and already existing high demand (Riaz et al., 2013 ). Methanol production using hydrogen and CO2  has already been achieved at a high technology readiness level, and thus, it has been previously investigated as a potential renewable energy carrier option (Al-Breiki and Bicer, 2021 ; Rinaldi et al., 2023 ; Lal and You, 2023 ). The concept of âmethanol economyâ was proposed considering its application as the main chemical with the ability to derive a wide spectrum of chemicals from ethers to higher chain alcohols (Olah, 2005 ). This work evaluates the methanol scenario, where the configuration demands energy in three primary stages: the electrolyzer's hydrogen production, CO2  extraction in the DAC, and the combination of H2  and CO2  within the modular methanol production. Consequently, Eq. (41)  outlines the overall balance of energy consumption in the methanol scenario.(41) P t M e O H   = P t D A C   + P t E L E   + P t M o d u l a r . M e O H       where P t D A C      and P t M o d u l a r . M e O H      denote the energy used in the DAC and modular methanol manufacturing unit, respectively. Considering the green methanol price (MeOH SP  ), the revenue generated in each time interval can be calculated as follows:(42) R E V E N U E M e O H   = M e O H S P   â M e O H t      where M e O H t     denotes the production rate of methanol in different time periods. Eq. (43)  calculates the amount of methanol produced using the power given to the modular manufacturing unit.(43) M e O H t  = P t Mod  u l a r . M e O H   â Î± M e O H       where Î± M e O H      signifies the conversion coefficient linking the energy usage in the modular unit to the rate of methanol production. Using comparable coefficients from existing literature (Î² MeOH  , Î© MeOH  ) to convert the energy consumption into production rates in the electrolyzer and the DAC, we can get the amount of hydrogen and CO2  produced using Eqs. (44) and (45) .(44) H 2 t  M e O H   = P t E L E   â Î² M e O H       (45) C O 2  t M e O H   = P t D A C   â Î© M e O H        The allocation of the total energy usage among the electrolyzer, DAC, and the modular manufacturing unit depends on their individual proportions in the methanol production process (Î¼ 1 M e O H     ; Î¼ 2 M e O H     ; Î¼ 3 M e O H     ).(46) P t E L E   = P t U T L   â Î¼ 1 M e O H       (47) P t D A C   = P t U T L   â Î¼ 2 M e O H       (48) P t M o d u l a r . M e O H   = P t U T L   â Î¼ 3 M e O H        However, there are limits to the total power consumed in these three pieces of equipment based on the number of units (N ELE  , N DAC  , N Modular.MeOH  ) utilized and the individual capacities for the units as described in the following equations:(49) N E L E   â P MIN E L E   â¤ P t E L E   â¤ N E L E   â P MAX E L E       (50) N D A C   â P MIN D A C   â¤ P t D A C   â¤ N D A C   â P MAX D A C       (51) N M o d u l a r .

The total capital expenditure (CAPEX MeOH  ) includes capital expenses on the electrolyzer (C ELE  ), DAC unit (C DAC  ), and modular units for methanol production (C Modular.MeOH  ). These capital expenses can be calculated using the number of electrolyzers, DAC, and modular units of methanol manufacturing.(52) C A P E X M e O H   = C E L E   + C D A C   + C M o d u l a r .

Considering the total lifespan of the utilized equipment, the salvage value can be determined using the double-declining depreciation method. Using these values, the total salvage value for the methanol scenario can be obtained.(56) S A L E L E   = D D E L E   â C E L E       (57) S A L D A C   = D D D A C   â C D A C       (58) S A L M o d u l a r .

M e O H      are the depreciation factors for the electrolyzer, DAC, and the modular methanol manufacturing unit, respectively. The aggregate operating expenses for the methanol scenario (O & M M e O H     ) include the operating cost of the electrolyzer and the storage cost for the hydrogen and methanol produced (O & M t H T A N K     ; O & M t M e O H . T A N K     ) as depicted below:(60) O & M M e O H   = â t = 1  T  ( O & M t E L E   + O & M t H T A N K   + O & M t M e O H . T A N K    )         2.5 Sensitivity analysis Among the various approaches available for sensitivity analysis (Ozarisoy and Altan, 2022a , 2022b ), in this work, we study the effect of parameters using single-point sensitivity analysis on the profitability derived from bitcoin mining and other chemical-based options based on power generation from planned renewable installations. We study the model output by varying one input parameter at a time. This approach originates from the one-at-a-time methods (Borgonovo and Plischke, 2016 ). Initially, we assign base case values and sensitivity case values to the model inputs. We obtain the base case model output (i.e., profit) using the base case values assigned to the input parameters. Then, we calculate the model output by varying one model input at a time from the base case to the sensitivity case. Using this approach, the sensitivity case values quantify the magnitude of the impact from the base case to the sensitivity case and the direction of change. We utilize this approach to generate sensitivity analysis results for all the planned renewable installations in the study operating under all considered scenarios of power utilization, i.e., bitcoin, hydrogen, methanol, and ammonia. The technology readiness level significantly influences the capital expenditure of a technology. Generally, more advanced and commercially available technologies are more affordable compared to their newer counterparts. For instance, electrolyzers, being well-established technologies, would have lower costs compared to the modular design costs for technologies like ammonia and methanol production units. Besides capital expenditure, the selling price of the product also plays an essential role in economic performance. Therefore, we examine key parameters for sensitivity analysis, including the capital expenses of the technologies and the selling prices of the products, as depicted in Figs. 8â11          .   3 Results 3.1 Profitability of bitcoin utilization Bitcoin mining is associated with substantial energy consumption, which could be obtained using excess renewable energy supply. Instead of selling this surplus power from renewable installations in the wholesale electricity market, it can be harnessed for mining bitcoins. The primary energy drain in bitcoin mining farms comes from the mining equipment itself. Heat pumps are also used for ventilation and cooling, further contributing to energy demands. In this work, we cover a wide geographical area with planned renewable installations spread across 83 counties in various US states to investigate the potential of bitcoin mining to utilize surplus power. Two prominent states in the renewable energy landscape are Oklahoma and Texas. Oklahoma notably has the most substantial single installation with a nameplate capacity of 500Â MW. Nameplate capacity refers to the full-load sustained output of a facility, in this case, the renewable energy installation. Most renewable installations in the study were found profitable, and only three stood out as unprofitable when their power output was employed in bitcoin mining. The MichiganâMeridian Wind Park, an onshore wind farm, recorded the highest power utilization at 62% of its 113Â MW nameplate capacity, along with the highest profit of $7.68 million. In terms of power utilization, it's followed by the Nebraska-Haystack Wind Project, with a 46% utilization. However, regarding total profits, it was observed that profitability isn't always directly proportional to power use. For instance, with only 34% utilization, the Oklahoma-Traverse Wind Project generated substantial profits ($4.08Â M), 23.5% more than the Nebraska-Haystack Wind Project. The analysis also revealed the potential of Texas as a significant player in the renewable landscape. This prominence can be attributed to Texas's overall installed nameplate capacity, which can provide an abundant power supply for such operations. The state not only boasts numerous planned installations but also houses among the most active bitcoin miners, underscoring the state's renewable energy potential and its role in the digital mining domain. Among the investigated planned installations in Texas, Roseland Solar Project and Aktina Solar were observed with the highest profits of $3.23Â M. The surplus power metric, which indicates how much energy is left unutilized, is also worth noting. As an illustration, regarding power utilization among installations in Texas, this value varied between 19% and 40%. This work unveiled a crucial insight into the dependency of the system's profitability on the dynamic bitcoin prices. The solar installations, for instance, reported a majority of surplus power, indicating low utilization, especially in certain scenarios where bitcoin prices might have affected profitability more than the total power utilization. The summary of the results for the bitcoin scenario is presented in Fig. 3 . The abbreviations assigned to the renewable energy projects considered in this study are detailed in the Appendix in Table A2 . This work also identified a range of variables that showed a strong correlation. For instance, profit and the number of heat pumps demonstrated a high correlation. As the number of heat pumps employed increased, so did the profit. This correlation can be explained by the fact that more heat pumps indicate the installation of a more significant number of miners, which, in turn, leads to increased bitcoin mining and, consequently, higher profits. Similarly, the profit from a particular state or county, with its specific power source, either wind or solar, strongly correlates with the surplus power. This observation indicates that complete utilization of the available power doesn't necessarily translate to higher profits. Profits are more likely to accrue during hours when mining is profitable, given the optimal size of a mining farm. This is due to the operational costs incurred from the mining facility, which must be accounted for to ensure a profitable system. It's essential to consider that the location is pivotal in determining whether a scenario is profitable, irrespective of the type of energy storage or utilization option deemed favorable. Even though a renewable project might be installed as a planned initiative to meet energy demands or sustainability goals, a significant amount of research should be conducted on the chosen site for renewable facility installation and the size of the project. Beyond this, some states have an inherent advantage over others due to their geographical resources, making specific locations more suitable for solar, wind, or sometimes both types of renewable energy. This is evident in the bitcoin scenario, where some sites prove to be more profitable regardless of the facility's size.  3.2 Chemical alternatives to bitcoin for energy utilization Compared to the bitcoin scenario, all planned installations exhibited a significant increase in profits based on power utilization in hydrogen production. For instance, a location in Kansas witnessed a substantial profit surge corresponding to the hydrogen scenario compared with the base case for the respective bitcoin scenario because it only generated a profit of $376.37 in the bitcoin scenario. Moreover, over 46 locations saw their profits increase by more than 1000% compared to their respective bitcoin scenarios. Meanwhile, 33 sites reported profit increases ranging from 130% to 984%. Similarly, hydrogen also outperformed all other chemical storage alternatives. However, it's important to note that a higher profit for a specific location doesn't necessarily mean that the respective location will also have the highest utilization rate, although it can occasionally be the case. For example, in the hydrogen scenario, Kansas had the highest reported increase in profit and the greatest surge in utilization rate compared to the bitcoin scenario. Upon further analysis, the use of hydrogen was found to be profitable for most renewable energy projects across the various counties. The highest profits were observed for the Texas-Roseland Solar Project, the Texas Atkina Solar Project, and the Texas-Old 300 Solar Center. These cases exhibited utilization rates of approximately 86%. The financial success of a scenario frequently depends on the market demand for its produced output. Due to its global market, hydrogen is deemed a favorable and profitable product. It commands a relatively high selling price, delivering higher profit margins than other chemicals such as ammonia and methanol. Thus, among all the scenarios, hydrogen yielded the highest profit. The relationships between variables, such as profit, surplus power, number of electrolyzers (nAWE ) units, and utilization rate, appeared to follow the trends observed in the bitcoin scenario. Profits and nAWE  displayed a direct correlation, where an increase in installed nAWE  units led to a corresponding increase in profit. Moreover, the profit and utilization rate seemed to cluster, with the utilization rate generally falling within the 65%â88% range. Unlike in the bitcoin scenario, solar photovoltaics contributed most significantly to surplus power in the hydrogen scenario. States with higher nameplate capacities led to higher utilization rates. Yet, states with lower capacities also performed comparatively well. Even the lowest profit for the hydrogen scenario was 184% higher than that of the bitcoin scenario. However, the lowest utilization rates for both the hydrogen and bitcoin scenarios were similar, at around 12%. Oregon emerged as the sole state without any capacity allocation, highlighting its unsuitability owing to its limited wind potential. The summary of the results for the hydrogen scenario is depicted in Fig. 4 . In terms of profitability, ammonia and methanol scenarios performed poorly, primarily due to their high capital investment requirements, even with modular systems. Given that the project lifespan is shorter than conventional ammonia and methanol plants, the timeframe to generate profit is significantly reduced, failing to compensate for the initial investments. In this analysis of the ammonia scenario, the Roseland Solar Project and Aktina Solar in Texas stood out as the most profitable planned installations. With a utilization rate of 50%, these sites registered profits of $4.67Â M. However, when juxtaposed against the hydrogen and bitcoin scenarios, the profitability landscape of ammonia exhibits further insights. While counties showed profitability in ammonia operations, the most profitable among them still lagged by 39.14% compared to its counterpart in the bitcoin scenario. This gap widened to an even higher 87.87% when benchmarked against the hydrogen scenario. It was also observed that solar photovoltaics accounted for more available renewable power utilization than onshore wind. However, profitable counties in the ammonia scenario mainly had utilization rates ranging from 50% to 59%, with only one location reaching 70%. Another distinctive feature of the ammonia scenario is its deviation from the trends seen in both hydrogen and bitcoin scenarios. The results indicate no clear correlation between profitability and the sizing metrics of electrolyzers and ammonia generation units, as depicted in Fig. 5 . These findings for the ammonia scenario provide insights for prospective stakeholders considering new ventures or investments. In examining the profitability dynamics of the ammonia and methanol scenarios, it was observed that both show similar profitability levels. Yet, the methanol scenario presents its own challenges, with the number of unprofitable ventures and planned installations in nine counties emerging as unsuitable for methanol production. Moreover, the methanol scenario highlighted that 15 sites secured only modest profits, under $100,000, across the project timeframe. This trend can be attributed to substantial capital costs for DAC and methanol units and a shorter pre-commercial phase relative to standard methanol plant lifespans. Utilization rates further underscore the disparities. The methanol scenario recorded the lowest rate among all studied scenarios. The only exception was the MichiganâMeridian Wind Park, which achieved a 59% utilization rate and highest profit of $4.2Â M. Correspondingly, the next highest utilization rate was 25%, with a $1.78Â M profit at the Traverse Wind Project in Oklahoma. Thus, while the methanol and ammonia scenarios share some trends in profitability, methanol poses its unique set of challenges and considerations, shedding light on areas demanding special attention from prospective stakeholders. The summary of the methanol scenario is shown in Fig. 6 . In order to assess which scenario outperforms others, we juxtaposed and compared all the planned renewable installations to determine which one takes the lead in terms of profits. This comparison assumes that the capacity of the solar or wind plant remains constant across scenarios. As shown in Fig. 7 , which ranks each scenario, hydrogen emerges as the most dependable option in terms of profit generation, followed by bitcoin mining. Conversely, the methanol scenario performed the worst, largely due to the high costs associated with its DAC system. The ammonia scenario performed relatively better than the methanol scenario, exhibiting relatively stable profit margins across all the counties under consideration.  3.3 Sensitivity analysis results Fig. 8  illustrates the impact of various sensitivity parameters for the top 20 most profitable sites, moving counterclockwise. As depicted in Fig. 8 , the selling price of hydrogen emerged as the most influential factor, followed by the capital expenditure of hydrogen electrolyzers. Profits for one of the planned installations increased by 66.28% with a rise in the selling price of hydrogen and by 30.63% with a decrease in the electrolyzer CAPEX. Overall, the hydrogen selling price was a significant driving factor behind profit increases and reductions. The profit trend for other sites followed a similar pattern to the base case scenarios. The profitability of the bitcoin scenario was negatively impacted by an increase in the cost of mining hardware, as illustrated in Fig. 9 . Indeed, only six sites remained profitable under increased capital expenditure on miners. Notably, these sites were all onshore wind power plants located in Michigan, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Texas. This trend suggests that onshore wind turbines may offer more consistent profits than solar power plants. A primary reason for this could be the different capacity factors of solar and wind power plants. Furthermore, wind turbines have the added advantage of power availability during most hours of the day. Overall, the cost of mining hardware emerged as a vital parameter. For the best-performing site, a 30% reduction in miner costs led to a substantial 426.91% increase in system profits. The capital expenditure on heat pumps (HP CAPEX) also affected profit, but the impact was considerably less significant, ranging from a minimum of 1.42% to a maximum of 4.82%. In the ammonia scenario, the factors taken into account included the capital expenditure for the electrolyzer, ASU, modular production plant, and the selling price of ammonia. As observed in the hydrogen case scenario, the selling price of the product had the most significant impact. Profits escalated by a range of 138.16% to a substantial 315.60% with an increase in the ammonia selling price, as shown in Fig. 10 . In contrast, a decrease in the ammonia selling price resulted in losses for all installations except one site. Meanwhile, the capital expenditure for the electrolyzer had the second most profound impact on the profitability of the ammonia scenario. We observed a profit increment between 47.12% and 136.82%. The capital expenditure for the modular ammonia plant had a similar impact to that of the ASU unit. However, it's important to note that as technology costs decrease in the future and greener technologies become prevalent, the selling price of green products can safeguard profits with a significant margin. Lastly, unlike the other scenarios discussed above, the methanol scenario exhibited the poorest performance. Although an increase in the methanol price resulted in a dramatic profit increase of up to 790.08%, conversely, a decrease in the price led the system to incur losses, making it untenable for the methanol scenario. Following the methanol selling price, the capital expenditure for the DAC emerged as the second most sensitive parameter. The impact of the capital expenditure for the methanol production unit (MeOH CAPEX) was lesser than that for the DAC. Nonetheless, despite being relatively small, MeOH CAPEX still exerted a significant influence on the overall profit of the system. Fig. 11  illustrates the varying influence of these parameters on different sites for the methanol scenario.   4 Discussion The findings of this work demonstrate the robust economic potential that can be derived from the intersection of renewable energy and blockchain applications like bitcoin mining and illustrate a pathway toward aligning technological advancements and financial metrics with global sustainability goals. The results show that bitcoin mining is a profitable alternative in 80 of the 83 examined planned renewable installations, with the highest profit being $7.68Â M, offering a compelling argument for this integration and evaluating it as an opportunity from the point of view of the UN SDGs. Specifically, integrating bitcoin mining with renewable energy can contribute towards SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 13 (Climate Action) by mitigating the traditionally high energy consumption and carbon footprint of cryptocurrency mining through leveraging renewable energy sources. Furthermore, the applicability of the findings expands to SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) by promoting innovative applications of renewable installations and potentially advancing infrastructural development in the clean energy sector. By focusing on these SDGs, blockchain with planned renewable installations harnesses economic and technological advancements and bolsters the global shift toward sustainability. Therefore, future policy decisions should incorporate an SDG-focused approach, ensuring that the progression of the renewable energy and cryptocurrency sectors occurs synergistically with global sustainability targets. As for effects on crypto-asset policies, using planned renewable installations can be an environmentally sustainable alternative to satiate the ever-increasing demand for bitcoins. In current practice, the bitcoin industry mainly relies on miners powered by the grid, resulting in a substantial carbon footprint. As an illustration, the yearly electricity consumption owing to bitcoin miners falls north of 111TWh, surpassing the electricity demands of countries like Bolivia and Cuba (Ritchie, 2022 ). The requirement for drastic policy changes concerning the climate impact of bitcoins can be understood with some countries like China banning bitcoin mining owing to their significantly high contribution in taking power from the grid, which predominantly uses fossil sources (John, 2021 ). However, despite these efforts to crack down on energy-intensive bitcoin mining, miners have gradually migrated to states such as New York and Texas, contributing 34% of bitcoin's hash rate within the US (Sigalos, 2021 ). Considering the increasing popularity of blockchain applications in varying sectors, including financial markets, business-to-business services, supply chains (Walport, 2016 ), etc., a more pragmatic approach would be using clean energy sources rather than efforts to reduce bitcoin mining. Instead of imposing restrictions on the applications of the blockchain industry, the exploration and integration of advanced energy storage technologies in the context of bitcoin mining and renewable energy projects present a novel opportunity. For instance, enabling advancements in energy storage technologies allows a continuous power supply to bitcoin mining operations, even in the absence of renewable power, thus addressing intermittency issues associated with renewables. Moreover, implementing smart energy management systems which dynamically allocate energy resources based on real-time demands and supplies, can enable a more efficient use of renewable energy in bitcoin mining operations, effectively reducing the overall energy requirements and the associated carbon footprint. Furthermore, the development of mining hardware that can adjust its operations according to the available energy supply can further facilitate the use of clean energy sources in blockchain applications. Therefore, the synergy between blockchain and renewable energy installations holds the potential to promote energy transition through enhanced renewable power capacity and added profits before grid integration. Transitioning from a fossil-dependent global energy landscape to one reliant on renewables necessitates an economically viable method for storing and transporting energy and a minimum climate footprint throughout the process. In this work, the assessment of three chemical-based energy storage options alongside bitcoin mining in planned renewable installations provided tangible insights into their sustainability potential. Specifically, hydrogen emerged as the leading option, offering both profitability and climate-friendly characteristics. In contrast, due to the cost-intensive nature of ammonia and methanol generation units and other auxiliary equipment required, like the DAC, coupled with the comparatively short life span of planned installations before grid integration, these scenarios were not profitable for various planned renewable installations investigated in this study. However, technical innovations focusing on sustainable production, such as improved energy efficiency or cost-competitive equipment, would reduce technology costs in the future and enable more planned renewable facilities to hedge into profits. For instance, a 30% reduction in capital expenditure for DAC enables an increment in profitability for the methanol scenario from 55% to 297%. Moreover, this work presents that aligning economic incentives with sustainable goals can lead to favorable outcomes. As an illustration, with a 30% increase in green ammonia's selling price, profits soared up to 315% with a minimum increase of 138%, thus underscoring the dual benefits of cleaner production through reduced climate impacts while bolstering economic gains. Consequently, these findings provide a compelling case for stakeholders to prioritize sustainable practices in planned installations, aligning profitability and climate sustainability in the US energy landscape. While this work provides a comprehensive understanding of the potential integration of blockchain with planned renewable installations, some limitations need to be addressed. Firstly, we utilize the available data on market prices and operational parameters. Market dynamics, such as volatile cryptocurrency values, can introduce uncertainties to projected profits. Future studies might consider modeling these market volatilities for a more robust profitability analysis. Secondly, this study focused primarily on planned renewable installations in US counties, which might not necessarily reflect the global scenario. Geographical location plays a pivotal role in determining the economic and environmental outcomes of such installations. More importantly, the pace of renewable energy integration can vary substantially between economically advanced regions and poorer economies. Despite having abundant renewable resources, many developing and low-income countries may face challenges such as limited financial resources, lack of technical expertise, and regulatory hurdles. These factors could delay or even halt the installation of renewable energy infrastructure in distinct regions. However, the proposed strategy of combining bitcoin mining with clean energy projects offers a distinctive opportunity for low-income countries. The economic potential generated by such integration can incentivize these countries to advance their renewable capacity. By tapping into the crypto market, these countries could generate significant profits, which can be reinvested into building and enhancing their renewable infrastructure. Not only would this approach capitalize on the growing demand for cryptocurrencies, but it would also help these countries advance on an accelerated track to sustainable energy independence. Conversely, if a significant proportion of global bitcoin mining operations continues to be powered by fossil fuels due to these disparities, the climate impact would continue to rise. Embracing renewable-powered crypto mining can help mitigate these concerns while also boosting the economic prospects of less developed countries. It's crucial for future analyses to account for these opportunities, exploring frameworks that can help developing countries harness the dual benefits of renewable energy and cryptocurrency markets. Furthermore, the environmental impact of bitcoin mining, even when powered by renewable sources, is not solely determined by its energy consumption but also by factors like electronic waste and the lifecycle emissions of mining hardware. Future investigations might delve deeper into these aspects to present a more holistic understanding of the environmental implications.  5 Conclusion The shift to renewable energy has witnessed increased international efforts over the past few years; however, it has faced challenges such as insufficient infrastructure and financial risks for investors. In this regard, the planned renewable projects, primarily solar and wind power installations, were unutilized until completely integrated with the power grid. Addressing the pivotal research question from this work, we showcased the potential of utilizing planned installations for alternative energy uses before they became a part of the main grid infrastructure. Specifically, this work compared the economic benefits of harnessing surplus energy for hydrogen, ammonia, methanol production, and blockchain applications like bitcoin mining. The findings of this work highlighted the untapped potential of bitcoin mining to catalyze investments in the renewable energy sector, supporting SDGs 7, 9, and 13. Bitcoin mining proved profitable in the majority of the examined planned installations, and by integrating this method, it could generate economic returns from otherwise unutilized assets and address climate concerns associated with conventional bitcoin mining operations. While the three chemical-based energy storage methods also offered valuable solutions, the profitability of bitcoin mining presented a compelling case for policymakers and investors. Thus, integrating bitcoin mining with planned installations could mitigate the climate challenges associated with traditional mining practices and correspondingly act as an incentive for future investments in the clean energy sector, aligning with key sustainable development priorities.
