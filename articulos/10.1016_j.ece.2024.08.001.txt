                  The purpose of this paper is to integrate the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the outlines of a Master's Degree in Industrial Engineering using active learning methodologies. The main objective of this integration is to favor sustainable human education and to increase students’ awareness and responsibility towards future generations from the chemical engineering point of view. Within the process engineering course, the students must design a chemical process using technical, economic, social and environmental criteria. Active learning methodologies were gradually introduced in different academic courses (Project-Based Learning, Collaborative Work and Flipped Classroom) and finally SDGs were implemented in the 2020–21 academic course. A synergetic effect with the active learning methodologies was observed, increasing the motivation of the students and the academics, and the complexity of the projects performed by students. The introduction of the SDGs improved academic results, which was reflected in the absence of failures and a decrease in the percentage of students passing with the lowest grade from 16 % to 10 %. Moreover, students report that this project significantly enhanced their knowledge of the SDGs related to energy and climate change; students having low or very low knowledge about SDGs were reduced to 7 % as compared to the initial 45 %.

Each of these goals has associated targets, totaling 169, with their respective indicators. The five pillars on which these goals are based are: planet, partnership, peace, prosperity and people. The achievement of these goals requires the participation of all actors in society, with actions ranging from global, local and personal levels. Against this background, the higher education institutions are agents of great relevance, since they oversee the training and education of future professionals and citizens, who will have to be the catalyzers of the necessary changes towards a sustainable existence of the human being on our planet (Leal Filho et al., 2021; López, 2022 ). The skills, knowledge and sensitivity to sustainability acquired at university will have a lifelong impact on graduates (Ramirez-Mendoza et al., 2020 ). Indeed, SDGs can promote community engagement in higher education by providing a high-level platform that encourages universities to respond to the needs of their external communities, at both local and global levels (Thomas Farnell, 2020; Nguyen et al., 2023; Rodriguez-Sanchez et al., 2024 ). Engineering is broadly considered a fundamental discipline to address sustainable development (Pérez-Foguet et al., 2018 ), and its impact in achieving the SDGs is unquestioned (Clifford and Zaman, 2016 ). However, some studies highlight that the vision that higher education offers is too narrow, unable to convey the whole essence and deep meaning of sustainable human development (Boni et al., 2016 ). Some publications (Christ et al., 2015; Watson et al., 2016 ), highlighted that sustainability is still embedded in engineering courses in a superficial and ad hoc  manner; often only as a "background". Considering this, there is a need to move forward in building a clear pathway between traditional engineering disciplines and SDGs (Sigahi et al., 2023 ). The sustainability challenges that future graduates will have to face will be increasingly complex and will require a balanced development of specific and transversal skills (Desha et al., 2019 ). For instance, in engineering, professionals are required to master the technical aspects of their field of knowledge, but also to be critical citizens, with the ability to understand and assess the ethical, social and environmental consequences of technical decisions (Owens, 2017 ). Therefore, new pedagogical strategies should be implemented in higher education institutions to promote sustainability among future professionals (Romero et al., 2020 ), and to foster the presence of academics committed to sustainable human development (Lazzarini et al., 2018 ). Moreover, there is a need to research case studies on good practices and evaluations of specific interventions in institutions that have been successful in the incorporation of the SDGs (Serafini et al., 2022 ). In active learning methodologies, the student stands as the center of the teaching-learning process, as opposed to their more passive role in traditional methodologies. Therefore, these methodologies are appropriate, not only to acquire the specific skills of each field, but also to integrate transversal skills and to work efficiently the SDGs (Beagon et al., 2023 ). In order to foster competences for sustainable development, Universities should promote active learning methodologies based on real world experiences related to SDGs (Martínez Casanovas et al., 2022 ). Project-Based Learning (PBL) is an effective active learning methodology, in which students are challenged to solve in groups a real-life situation (Kricsfalusy et al., 2018 ). The project, usually a final deliverable, is an opportunity for students to address a problem they may face in their professional careers (Savery, 2006 ). The goals related to this methodology are (Sanchis et al., 2020 ):1. Cooperative learning: promoting learning by shared knowledge among pairs.  2. Constructive and contextual learning: applying previous and new knowledge to solve a real-life problem.  3. Self-directed learning: by scheduling, monitoring, and assessing the learning activities.    Flipped classroom is another active learning methodology, in which the work of certain learning process is carried out by students before the lecture and uses class time to facilitate and enhance other processes of knowledge acquisition and practice, supporting all phases of the learning cycle (Kim et al., 2014 ). This allows the students to develop in the face-to-face sessions more complex and higher cognitive level learning outcomes, which students must achieve with both the guidance of the professor and the collaborative work of their classmates (Bishop and Verleger, 2013; Kerr, 2015 ). Hence, this methodology helps students to deepen in certain aspects after the classroom sessions, as well as to reflect on the work carried out. The purpose of this methodology is (Prieto Martín, 2017 ):1. To encourage student autonomy.  2. To increase student/tutor interaction.  3. To carry out a formative evaluation and provide immediate feedback.  4. To favor a deeper, active and experiential learning.    In this contribution, we present a case study on the integration of the SDGs in a subject of the master's degree in Industrial Engineering, in which active methodologies, PBL and Flipped Classroom, were previously implemented in a sequential manner. There are few previous studies on the use of PBL (Guerra, 2017; Terrón-López et al., 2020 ) and Flipped Learning (Buil-Fabregá et al., 2019 ) to incorporate SDGs in Engineering Education; however, we are not aware of studies that combine both PBL and Flipped Learning with SDGs. This contribution also intends to critically discuss the results achieved by industrial engineering master's degree students after the implementation of the active learning methodologies. The experience achieved and the methodology developed may serve as a model for its implantation in other university engineering courses. 1.1 Context of the practical study The master's degree in Industrial Engineering is a transversal degree characteristic of the Spanish educational system. Professionals in this field must have knowledge in different branches of engineering, such as chemical, electrical, mechanical, materials, electronics, energy and construction. This transversal knowledge is highly appreciated in a wide number of professional fields, due to the high versatility of Industrial Engineering graduates. However, integrating all these disciplines is also a challenge from a teaching-learning perspective (Gómez-Coma et al., 2023 ). The master's degree in Industrial Engineering of the School of Engineering of Bilbao, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), lasts two years, with a total of 120 ECTS credits. 300 places are offered, and it is taught in Spanish, Basque and English. There are some previous studies that implement PBL (Rodriguez-Sánchez et al., 2024 ; Alves et al. 2016 ) and Flipped Learning methodologies (Blázquez-Parra et al. 2021 ) in Industrial Engineering master's with similar curricula. The practical study presented in this paper was carried out in the subject of Chemical Process Design (3 ECTS), which is taught during the first semester of the master’s degree to four different groups. The learning outcomes of the course are summarized as follows (detailed competences, learning outcomes and lessons of the subject are given in Supplementary Information ):1. To analyze and design different chemical processes.  2. To perform simulations of chemical processes and to analyze the different design options based on technological, economic and environmental criteria.  3. To evaluate the social and environmental impact of the different alternatives in the design of an industrial chemical plant.    The course is divided into a theoretical and a practical part. In the first part (21 face-to-face classroom hours), the main concepts for the design of non-isothermal reactors and the principal separation operations are introduced, as well as the characteristics of an existing industrial process with a high degree of intensification in the faculty industrial surrounding (i.e. H2 SO4  industrial production). In the practical part (9 face-to-face classroom hours), the students use a commercial chemical process simulation software (Aspen Plus) to carry out several calculations related to the topics covered in theoretical lessons, i.e. the design of non-isothermal reactors and some separation units. The use of simulation software enables them to perform real calculations, which imply complex mathematical calculations that are not possible to tackle by means of manual resolutions. However, the objectives of the teaching staff were more ambitious, and it was not limited only to get the knowledge about how to design a reactor or a distillation column using a commercial software, but also to get a general overview and to be able to approach the design of a chemical industrial process from all its aspects. For this purpose, to go further and address not only technological but also economic, social and environmental aspects, during the last academic years different active methodologies have been gradually introduced in the practical part of the course, improving the teaching-learning process:1. PBL and cooperative work (introduced in the 2016–17 academic year).  2. Flipped classroom (introduced in the 2018–19 academic year).    Within this context, we consider that theoretical lessons can contribute to get the fundamentals of the design of reactors and separation units, while the practical part can be ideal to explore further aspects through a broader analysis using the aforementioned methodologies. Thus, the combination of an open project, with PBL and cooperative work methodologies is an ideal environment for the integration of the SDGs (Fernandez Rivas et al., 2020a, 2020b ; Pérez-Sánchez and Sanchis, 2021; Nguyen et al., 2023 ). This open project involves process intensification, in which waste is generated, and environmental and social impacts may occur. In this way, in addition to familiarizing students with the SDGs, they have a tool to deepen their critical thinking and the consequences of their technical decisions. The employment of Flipped classroom is orientated to the learning process of the software itself, as it is explained in the “Methodology” section.   2 Methodology The novelty of the methods employed lies in the unique combination of three active teaching methodologies—Project-Based Learning (PBL), cooperative learning, and Flipped Classroom—integrated with a focus on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This approach enhances student engagement, deepens understanding, and promotes the application of theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, while also ensuring that students consider social and environmental impacts as part of their engineering solutions. 2.1 Project-Based Learning (PBL) and cooperative learning PBL is employed to provide students with open-ended projects that simulate real-world chemical engineering challenges. Cooperative learning is integrated into PBL to foster teamwork, enhance problem-solving skills, and improve learning outcomes. The objectives sought through PBL are perfectly aligned with those developed by other authors. (Prieto, 2007 ; Slavin, 2010 ):• Motivate students and raise initiative.   • Enhance understanding of the tasks and their purposes.   • Improve the quality of the work compared to individual efforts.   • Increase mastery of procedures and concepts.   • Develop better social relationships in a learning context.     2.2 Flipped Classroom Methodology To address challenges with the complex Aspen Plus software, we implemented a Flipped Classroom approach. This method involves students engaging with preparatory materials, such as videos, before attending class sessions. This pre-class preparation allows in-class time to be devoted to practical application and deeper exploration of concepts. The Flipped Classroom methodology aims to:• Acquaint students with fundamental concepts of the chemical process simulation software.   • Teach students how to conduct bibliographic searches of scientific articles.     2.3 Integration of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) In subsequent academic years, the course incorporated the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the 2020–21 academic course. This addition was a natural progression, aligning with the course's objectives to address broader social and environmental impacts in chemical engineering projects. Students were required to:• Integrate SDGs by analyzing the social and environmental impacts of the proposed process on local and global scales.   • Justify the measures adopted to implement the SDGs in the chemical process design.   • Critically evaluate the implications of these measures on the process.     2.4 Case study: project implementation Each academic year, students are assigned a unique project to design a chemical process using knowledge from theoretical lectures. They must use Aspen Plus software for this purpose. The projects are structured as open scenarios, specifying the desired compound to be produced and providing an outline for project development. Detailed documentation is provided to students, including report content, deliverables and a project timeline. Students receive a detailed schedule of the project at the beginning of the course, outlining the pre-session video assignments, in-class activities, project progress expectations, and deadlines. Students must produce a final report detailing the industrial production process, including technology, equipment dimensions, production capacity, and other relevant details. An example of a project flowsheet to be developed by students, a cumene production process, is shown in  Fig. 1 . Further details of a specific project document provided to students and report content are available in the Supplementary Information . The project implementation considering the previously mentioned methodologies is described in more detail below.  2.5 Cooperative Work Students work in groups of 3–4 people, with each group filling out a group creation document that assigns roles to each member. They have access to resources on teamwork to help manage potential conflicts (Oakley et al., 2004 ). At the project's end, peer evaluations and self-evaluations are conducted to ensure accountability and to identify any students who may have been less active.  2.6 Flipped Classroom Implementation Recognizing the challenges students faced with the Aspen Plus software, a Flipped Classroom methodology was initially introduced. Four videos were created, covering all but one unit, allowing for an analysis of learning differences with and without the Flipped Classroom approach. Although, given the students' suggestions, and given their effectiveness, in the last two academic years all the lessons had video. Therefore the questionnaires prepared to be answered by students before and after the project have been modified with the years. After including the last video, the questions 14, 15 and 16 of the post questionnaire were eliminated (Supplementary Information ).  2.7 SDGs integration In the course 2020–21 the SDGs were integrated in the project. The open scenario presented to students included SDGs both in the project structure and its final evaluation. Students were required to critically evaluate and integrate SDGs, analyzing the social and environmental impacts of their proposed process, and to justify the measures adopted to implement SDGs in the chemical process design. Some examples could be the raw material to be used, determining whether it is renewable or not, when analyzing the energy efficiency of the process, when minimizing or analyzing how to reduce energy requirements, whether the process presents emissions that may be pollutants and, therefore, affect the environment from an environmental point of view, etc.  2.8 Evaluation and feedback Assessment of the different methodologies employed was conducted through Moodle-based questionnaires administered before and after the project. These surveys provided valuable feedback, highlighting areas for improvement in subsequent years. More than 95 % of the students participated in the questionnaires. These questionnaires are carried out anonymously through the Moodle (eGela) platform. The questionnaires of the first years were focused on Flipped Classroom methodology, comparing learning outcomes with and without video support. Later years surveys also assessed students' knowledge and understanding of SDGs before and after project completion. The questionnaires (pre and post) used for assessment are included in the Supplementary Information . Continuous monitoring of the projects was carried out during the six weeks period where they completed the project, through face-to-face sessions and through individual or group tutorials. At the end of the project, each group submitted a concise report (maximum five pages). In the 2021–22 academic year, in addition, they had to produce a 3-minute video summarizing the project and in 2022–23 the video was replaced by an oral presentation. The evaluation of the entire project was based on a checklist rubric available to students from the start of the course (see rubric in Supplementary Information ).   3 Results 3.1 PBL methodology implementation After the application of the PBL methodology during the initial academic courses, the feedback obtained was positive regarding the work environment and the learning outcomes achieved by students. A very positive aspect of the PBL implementation is that students learned to design and develop each process by making decisions on solving open-problems, since they took advantage of the recommended and available bibliography and were guided by the teaching staff. Thus, they were able to define the full process and collect needed data through self-learning. Moreover, students’ opinion about PBL methodology was positive. Their motivation was higher than with the previous traditional approach, enhancing the relationship among students, and between students and lecturer, leading to a more constructive working atmosphere. This information was obtained through the Working Group Formation documents and the questionnaires for the evaluation of the team partners’ work, which recorded the good atmosphere and the good dynamics of the different groups. After PBL implementation, the scores obtained by students in the project were much better than those before, as almost no one failed (less than 1 %), and the grades clearly improved (see  Table 1 ). Nevertheless, there were several challenges that needed to be overcome, such as: i) some students indicated difficulty in learning how to use the Aspen Plus software, ii) there was a feeling of dissatisfaction with the increased workload, although they felt they could learn more effectively, and iii) students were not entirely in agreement with being assessed both during the PBL project and with a final exam. These challenges pushed the authors to follow with the implementation of the Flipped Learning methodology.  3.2 Flipped Learning methodology implementation Observing the difficulties students faced with the Aspen Plus software, a Flipped Classroom approach was incorporated to enhance their knowledge of the software and prevent it from becoming a bottleneck in the design of the chemical process in the project. Students in the first academic courses had not previously used Aspen Plus in any other subject, as can be observed in the figure about question 1 given in Supplementary Information . In the 2022–23 academic course there was a large increase in the number of students who had previously worked with this software, due to a modification made in the subject Chemical Technology in the third year of the Bachelor’s Degree in Industrial Engineering. Students coming from this degree knew Aspen Plus, while students coming to the Master’s from other degrees had no previous knowledge. To analyse the effectiveness of this methodology, one of the sessions was performed without applying this methodology, thus, the comparison of the methods could be carried out. The students’ point of view about Flipped Classroom was collected by means of questionnaires and face-to-face discussion during the lessons or tutorials. During the first years of application of the Flipped Classroom methodology, students were not used to working with this methodology, as can be observed in the figure of question 2 in the Supplementary Information . There is an increase in the students’ knowledge of this methodology from the 2021–22 academic course onwards, which is an indication of the gradual implementation of active methodologies in university courses. Even so, it is clear that students are not aware of the pedagogical tool used by lectures, as they initially say that they have not heard of the Flipped Classroom methodology (answer to question 2), but once the methodology is described (question 3), most of them say that they have already worked with it. In  Fig. 2  (left) it can be observed that the confidence of the students after attending class increased notoriously when Flipped Classroom approach was incorporated. When the last lesson was worked with the traditional methodology (in the face-to-face practical class the topic was explained and an example and an example of simulation of that process was made in Aspen Plus) compared to the Flipped Learning methodology (the students had to previously watch the video where the topic was quickly explained and an example of simulation was done), only 30 % of the students felt very confident with the topic after attending the class compared to 50 % in the lessons with video. These results evidenced a deeper learning process as a result of incorporating Flipped Classroom approach. Detailed survey results for the lessons with video can be found in the graph in question 12 of the Supplementary Information , and for the non-video lessons in the graph in question 14. In addition, the majority of students believed that they would have learned more if the last lesson had been taught with the Flipped Learning methodology (question 15 of Supplementary Information ). Upon confirming the methodology´s effectiveness, Flipped Learning was implemented in all the sessions in the 2022–23 academic year. From that year on, the questions 14, 15 and 16 were removed from the questionnaire. This is the reason why in the related figures in Supplementary Information  there is no data in these three graphs for the 2022–23 and 2023–24 academic years. The implementation of Flipped Classroom does not finish when recording the videos. The face-to-face sessions are crucial for an effective learning process. This is evidenced in the results obtained in the questionnaires (Fig. 2 , right). Before attending class, most of the students felt “confident ”. However, the percentage of students who felt “very confident ” about the subject increased by more than 50 % after attending the classes (question 12 of the questionnaire in Supplementary Information ). The idea of the importance of the face-to-face activities was also observed in the students’ answers (questions 23, 24 and 25 of the Supplementary Information ):“One of the disadvantages could be that it is assumed that we have fully understood the software just watching the video”  “The problem is that if a section is not well understood, the student could not solve this problem by him/herself”   Therefore, it is noticeable that, although Flipped Learning is a student-centred approach, the tutor´s guide is essential to achieve the desired knowledge. This is in good agreement with the investigation carried out by Lewin et al. (Lewin and Barzilai, 2022 ). In their work they concluded that active problem solving by students after watching the videos is the step that has greatest impact on perceived mastery. The improvement in the understanding of the topics worked on during the classes was reflected in the enhancement of the quality of the projects carried out by the students. Having the videos available was very helpful for the students. They can watch them more than once, in fact most students watched the videos between 1 and 3 times (results of question 17 in Supplementary Information ). The videos are especially helpful when it comes to simulating the process students have to design for the project, since the last topic also had a video, which is the most complex unit to simulate in Aspen Plus among the ones students have to simulate in the project, the number of students who consulted the videos during the final project increased from 60 % to around 90 % (question 18 in Supplementary Information ). Around 75 % of the students thought that they understood better the lessons because they have watched the videos before (graph of question 19 in Supplementary Information ). Similar results were achieved by Ruslan et al. (2022)  in the implementation of Flipped Classroom for process simulation class, which concluded that Flipped Classroom approach significantly improved the students’ performance compared to the traditional approach. Another interesting observation obtained from the questionnaires is the difference in the students’ dedication before attending the face-to-face activities depending on the learning methodology employed. The results obtained are summarized in  Fig. 3 . More than 25 % of the students did not work on the unit before attending to the lecture when traditional learning was applied. This percentage was reduced to less than 10 % when Flipped Classroom was established. These results probably influenced a higher motivation of the students and a deeper learning.  3.3 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) implementation Once Project-Based Learning and Flipped Learning were introduced, the next step was the integration of the Sustainable Development Goals at the 2020–21 academic year. The main reason for this incorporation is that being future engineers they need to understand the relevance of sustainability in their future professional career. The impact of the SDGs on chemical engineering processes is extremely high in energy, raw materials savings, process design, waste production, etc. In addition, many of these Sustainable Development Goals are within the knowledge area of process engineering, and the design and optimization of chemical plants. For instance, the SDG number 6, “Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all”, a lot of chemical processes use water as a cooling agent, as a reagent, as a by-product, etc. The SDG number 7, “Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all”, in a chemical plant there are operations involving heating, cooling, compression, etc. so that students can analyze different process alternatives for the intensification of energy. The SDG number 12, “Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns”, the desired product should be produced in the most sustainable way. The SDG number 13, “Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts”, in most of the chemical engineering processes greenhouse effect compounds and or some pollutants are produced, which is something that must be analyzed to try to reduce and mitigate their impact. There are also other SGDs that could be included in processes related to the chemical industry, but in general those described above are the ones with the greatest impact. Based on this premise, the teaching group started considering two options: giving the students the SDGs to be taken into account directly, or leaving it up to them to decide which of the SDGs they should analyze in their project. After a period of reflection and discussion, it was decided that the best option to enhance students’ learning process was to let them decide for themselves which were the most significant SDGs to analyze within their project, since this requires a higher level of analysis and knowledge. Students were guided to focus on goals related to two SDGs where the project could have a positive impact. The SDGs chosen and their justification were valuable information when evaluating the projects. The starting point was to find out what their initial knowledge of the SDGs was, using an initial survey. Two questions were prepared (questions 6 and 7 of the previous questionnaire in Supplementary Information ): i) Have you heard about the Sustainable Development Goals?,  and ii) Indicate your current level of knowledge about the SDGs . Regarding the results obtained in the first question (figure of question 6 in Supplementary Information ), there is a clear trend over the years. Students who knew very little about the SDGs were around 30 % in 2020–21 course, slowly decreasing to less than 10 % in 2023–24. Students who knew something or a lot about the SDGs have been increasing proportionally over the years. This is a very interesting result as it points to two important ideas. The first one is the slowness with which the SDGs are being disseminated to society and introduced and worked on in universities, considering that they were established in 2015, almost ten years ago. The second is that the effort made by different sectors of society is yielding good results, as university graduates are becoming increasingly aware of their impact and influence on the sustainability of the world. This last aspect is of vital importance in the world of engineering due to the high impact it can have. The implementation in the project and the use of the Flipped Classroom methodology led to a significant improvement in students’ perception of their knowledge of the SDGs.  Fig. 4  shows, as an example, the 2020–21 results of question 6 (prior knowledge of SDGs) compared to the answers to question 21 (post knowledge of SDGs after the project). The result on initial knowledge about the SDGs reflected that our students needed to improve their knowledge before integrating them into their project. Leveraging the already implemented Flipped Classroom methodology in the subject, students were provided with a series of audiovisual materials to enhance their understanding of the SDGs, and also some in-class discussions were implemented to enable them to successfully consider the SDGs in the proposed project. The perception of knowledge shifted to higher in the responses given in the questionnaire after completing the project, with around 50 % of students answering that they knew a lot. In the final questionnaire, there was another question regarding the SDGs (question 22), which aimed to find out whether the approach taken by the teaching team had been adequate and in line with expectations: “How difficult has it been to consider the SDGs in the design and development of the project?”.  Detailed data on the results achieved in the four academic courses in which the SDGs have been implemented can be found in the Supplementary Information  (figure of question 22).  Fig. 5  shows the data for the academic course 2020–21, as an example. The responses indicated that although the SDGs to be implemented were selected by the students and are very easy to relate to chemical engineering processes, the students did not find easy to integrate them into their designs. It was clear that there is a big difference between qualitative knowledge of something, in this case the SDGs, and actual implementation. In the case of chemical industries, they have a lot of room for improvement at the design stage, so it is not so easy to implement the necessary measures for a more sustainable process. For example, achieving lower energy consumption implies having a better understanding of the process and the equipment involved, as well as the operating parameters used. Implementing all these aspects makes the process more complicated and the simulation of the process in Aspen Plus more complex, with more flows, more interconnections, new equipment such as heat exchanges, pre-treatment of the raw material employed, etc. Most of the students found it difficult or very difficult to integrate the SDGs in the design and development of the project. In summary, the results obtained from the surveys reflect that the students had improved their knowledge of SDGs throughout the development of the project, which was one of the major objectives of the teaching group. In addition to this, the students were able to integrate the SDGs into the design of a chemical process, analyzing which raw materials were more sustainable, taking into account the energy savings of the process through optimization, and the mitigation of waste or pollutants production when optimizing the separation and purification units. Students carried out heat integration and optimization of separation and purification units in the proposed chemical process, therefore, the proposed designs were much more efficient from an energy and environmental point of view. Reinforcing the observations made by the professors, below are listed some general ideas extracted from the final anonymous survey carried out by the students (questions 25, 26 and 27 of the post questionnaire given in Supplementary Information ):a) It has been easy because, after all, if a process wants to be optimized to the maximum, it must always take into account a saving in the materials used and a planning to be able to treat the products in an optimal way, to make the process more sustainable and help to use the least amount of energy and resources possible, without excessively polluting the planet.   b) We have worked with a compound that respects the environment and meets the objectives of the SDGs.   c) Some things have been taken into account, such as reducing the consumption of raw materials (recirculating), reducing energy consumption (heat) in the kettles of the distillers or taking advantage of the energy released in the reactor by the exothermic reaction.     However, there were also some few general comments that made the professors think that there is room for improvement (questions 25, 26 and 27 of the of the post questionnaire given in Supplementary Information ):a) It has not been very easy to include the SDGs because I did not understand very well what was required of them. It would be nice if this section was better explained in class and an example was made on which to base ourselves for our projects.   b) They have only been mentioned (SDGs), without taking them into account for the simulation in Aspen.   c) It is easy to take them into account, but it also depends on the degree of commitment you want to adopt. Getting involved in a great way with the SDGs requires more work and in our case we have not been so demanding in that aspect, but they seem easy objectives to visualize.     Finally, the students had to make a short video, in the academic course 2022–23, explaining the project carried out. This video was replaced by a presentation in the 2023–24 academic course. The integration of the SDGs in their project was one of the points to be discussed. In general, students did a great job in summarizing main ideas of the project including technical decisions, simulation results, and integrating the SDGs in the plant design. The use of SDGs is a very useful tool to motivate the students and to design and develop more sustainable chemical processes. The results of the questionnaires also allowed us to identify areas for improvement for the following courses. This facilitates the cycle of learning, improving, and applying, which is crucial for achieving a high-quality education system. In general, students think that the methodologies employed in this subject are adequate, with a growing tendency of students answering yes to this question. As can be observed in the graph from question 20 in Supplementary Information , the positive feeling of students has raised from around 60 % till almost 80 % in the course 2023–24.  3.4 Discussion and future perspectives The use of the Flipped Classroom methodology allowed to improve the quality of the PBL, and to deepen the handling of the Aspen Plus chemical process simulator. Along with this, the introduction of the SDGs promoted the design of more sustainable processes, with a greater technical demand to fulfill the goals. Together, these three resources have resulted in a greater knowledge of the simulator and students acquiring a deeper understanding of the learning skills. In terms of the grades achieved by the students, Table 1  shows their evolution during the last 9 academic years. The number of students in these 6 years has been more than 1200, with an average of 210 students per academic year. Regarding the effect of the Flipped Classroom, the academic results of the project were maintained, increasing slightly in the 2019–20 academic year. Nonetheless, the main difference was observed on the complexity of the projects, with improved software proficiency, and better utilization of face-to-face hours, students were capable of introducing and considering more engineering aspects in their design. The best academic results were obtained in the 2020–21 academic year (grades A plus B), when the Flipped Classroom and SDGs were implemented together with the PBL. However, in the 2021–22 academic year, the results worsened. It must be considered that in the 2021–22 academic course there were significant changes, such as the return to normality after the pandemic, and changes in the teaching staff. It is plausible that the teaching staff moved towards more demanding correction criteria due to the gradual improvement of the projects through the years and the modification of the teaching methodology and staff. Indeed, the data of the last two academic years, 2022–23 and 2023–24, show a trend of improving grades by introducing SDGs. On average, the marks corresponding to C, the lowest pass mark, were similar with PBL value of 15.5 %, PBL + Flipped Classrooms 16.1 %, while the inclusion of SDGs reduced this value below 10.1 %. Without considering the 2020–21 academic year results, the value would be 4.9 %, demonstrating that the inclusion of the SDGs directly affects the quality of the works obtained. Additionally, it is observed that involving students in more active methodologies increases their involvement and learning, which has a direct consequence on the number of failed projects (D grade), which has remained between 0 % and 1 % in the last 8 courses. In short, the implementation of Flipped Classroom and SDGs has improved the quality and complexity of the projects. Moreover, it has made them more sustainable and has contributed to the integration of SDGs in technology, which increased the learning skills of the students. All the experience gained during previous courses has been translated into improvements implemented during the 2022–23 and 2023–24 academic courses, such as:a) A deeper discussion of the SDGs Knowledge of the SDGs has a social nature that can lead to greater motivation and improve the skills developed in the project, in addition to improving its sustainability. Students are now required to choose, not only two SDGs in which the projects can help, but also a third one in which the project can have a negative impact. For instance, in the selection of the capacity of the chemical plant, not only economic aspects, but also aspects related to the impact of such installation in the surrounding and in the community were considered by students.  b) Progress in the development of transversal skills There are transversal skills, such as social commitment or critical thinking, which can help to integrate the SDGs into the project. Critical thinking would involve analyzing which SDGs are the most appropriate in the design, whether the implementation of the SDGs would have any negative impact on the project, etc.  c) Update of the rubrics The updating of the rubrics has been useful not only for the students, but also for the teachers involved in the subject. This favors the integration of new teachers and the uniformity of assessment criteria within the course (see Supplementary Information ).  d) Increase the percentage of the project in the final mark    Given the motivating nature of the project and given that the students acquire a deeper knowledge of the learning skills, the contribution of the project grade to the final mark was increased, from 30 % to 40 %. In addition, a presentation of the project carried out has been implemented as well as to answer some questions from their classmates and professors.   4 Conclusions The implementation of innovative teaching methodologies in the Chemical Processes Design course has led to significant improvements in students’ outcomes. Our findings can be summarized as follows:1. Enhanced motivation and performance through PBL.  The introduction of Project-Based Learning (PBL) significantly improved student motivation and academic performance. The active involvement in practical, real-world projects fostered a more engaging and stimulating learning environment, leading to higher student marks.  2. Increased confidence and engagement with Flipped Classroom.  The adoption of Flipped Classroom methodology resulted in increased student confidence following master classes compared to traditional teaching approaches. Questionnaires indicated that students dedicated more time to preparation before attending classes, which likely contributed to higher motivation and deeper learning. Despite these benefits, face-to-face sessions remained crucial for effective learning, highlighting the importance of direct interaction in the educational process.  3. Motivation and awareness through integration of SDGs.  The incorporation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within PBL and the Flipped Classroom framework had a highly motivating effect on students. This integration not only enhanced students' understanding of the course's learning outcomes but also significantly increased their awareness of sustainability issues. The percentage of students with limited knowledge of the SDGs dropped from 45.4 % to 7 %, underscoring the effectiveness of this approach in raising awareness about the relevance of sustainability in chemical process design.  4. Improvement in process quality and competence development.  Integrating SDGs into the design of chemical processes not only improved the quality of these processes but also fostered the development of new transversal competences such as social commitment and critical thinking. These competences enriched the students' knowledge base, as evidenced by the answers to the questionnaires and by the projects designed. Additionally, there was a noticeable reduction in the percentage of students receiving C marks, with A and B grades reaching 93–97 % in three of the academic courses with implementation of SDGs.    In conclusion, the combination of PBL, Flipped Classroom, and the integration of the SDGs has proven to be a powerful approach in enhancing student motivation, engagement, and overall learning outcomes in a master's level engineering course. These methodologies collectively contribute to a more holistic and effective educational experience, preparing students to meet contemporary challenges in chemical engineering with a strong foundation in sustainability.
