                  The scuba diving industry is vital to economies of Small Island Developing States (SIDS), providing a pivotal opportunity to realise their blue economy aspirations. This industry is fundamentally dependent on both the health of the marine environment coupled with a skilled and safe underwater labour force. This article explores the interlinkages between the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 8 (Decent Work) and 14 (Life Below Water) in particular through the lens of workers below water and contends that the scuba diving industry can be a crucial enabler for SIDS blue economy. The SDG target 14.7, explicitly developed for SIDS, provides a direct linkage in this context. Mapping functional interlinkages between decent work and ocean sustainability policy through the lens of the diving sector offers opportunities to enhance the development of scuba industry-based skills training while simultaneously addressing the healthy ocean aspirations of SDG 14.

Keywords SIDS  Dive safety  SDG 8  Decent work  SDG 14  Blue economy    1 Introduction Scuba that is, Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus along with other compressed air diving systems forms a multibillion-dollar global industry [1,2] . The scuba industry is essential to marine tourism, fisheries and aquaculture, shipping, oil and gas, marine science, navy and other maritime law enforcement authorities and requires a highly skilled below water workforce [3–5] . It is estimated that the dive tourism industry alone is worth over US$36 billion globally and is anticipated to play a critical role in realising blue economic growth for Small Island Developing States (SIDS) [6–8] . However, the foundation for blue economic growth policies and associated jobs is fundamentally dependent on the health of the oceans in the SIDS, where tourism and fisheries are the predominant sectors [8–11] . The critical importance of the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans and its marine resources was accorded international political weight through the oceans, becoming a distinct goal among the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals under Agenda 2030 [12,13] . Sustainable Development Goal 14: Life Below Water (SDG 14) seeks to integrate with other SDGs and balance social, economic, and environmental sustainability in the ocean economy, which is particularly relevant to SIDS [12,14–16] . SDG 14 is categorised as an “environmental goal” [17,18]  that focuses on mitigating ocean environmental threats such as marine pollution, unsustainable fishing practices, loss of coastal and ocean habitat, and the effects of climate change [15] . SDG 14, therefore, alone does little to address the socio-economic issues, which are instead dealt with under other SDGs [9,15,19] . There is, however, increasing recognition that SDG14 needs to take into account social consideration[20–22] . This, in turn, illustrates the need for interlinkages between SDGs, for example, to develop a highly skilled labour force to 'work below water' is necessary for realising SDG 14, something that should be a strategic priority for SIDS. An exception in this context is that one of SDG 14 target (14.7), which was explicitly developed for SIDS and least developed countries, and envisions increased economic benefits through the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism [12,23] . Therefore innovative strategies are required to reinforce sustainability aspirations between these distinct sectors alongside decent work and job creation policies [9,11] . Considering synergies between industry-specific skills requirements and labour policies across fisheries, aquaculture, tourism [24]  and the scuba diving sectors is critical in addressing deficits in decent work and well-being of the coastal communities [24–26] . For example, conservation strategies are likely to constrain options for job creation in specific marine sectors such as fisheries. However, sectoral cooperation mechanisms on industry-based skills can help generate jobs in other areas such as marine tourism [9,24,27] . Recognising and promoting the interlinkages of SDG 14 is vital in achieving the 2030 Agenda, as emphasised by Le Blanc et al. [14,28]  Ntona and Morgera. [15]  Singh et al. [29]  Nash et al.[30]  Obura [31] . The work by Elder et al. [32] , Tosun et al. [33]  subsequently highlights the importance and the impact of SDG interlinkages on institutional reforms and policy integration outcomes at the national level. Here we identify important interdependencies between SDG 14 and SDG 8 pertaining to decent work as per the principles of the UN’s International Labour Organisation program of work. The fundamental focus of SDG 8 is on social responsibility, the future of work, an inclusive labour market with adherence to occupational safety alongside environmental sustainability and economic growth [34–36 ]. The scuba diving industry within a number of blue economy sectors has a vital role to play in this context. It can be anticipated that scuba’s 'work below water' labour force will substantially contribute to achieving target 14.7 pertaining to the sustainable use of coral reefs and the marine environment in SIDS. Our objective is to demonstrate how the scuba diving industry is uniquely positioned as a means to highlight and understand the interlinkage that SDG target 14.7 creates between SDG 8 and SDG 14. This article first discusses the scuba diving industry's economic contributions and its recognition by island policymakers in advancing SDG 14 progress. It then provides a conceptual reinforcement of the direct interlinkage that target 14.7 creates between SDG 8 and SDG 14 through the lens of the ‘work below water’ workforce (see  Fig. 1 ). The article draws attention to the policy needs of dive tourism, dive fisheries and public sector diving labour force within the 2030 Agenda for SDG framework, in particular SDG 14 and the blue economy of SIDS. The article, therefore, addresses issues of direct and urgent concern for SIDS policymakers. We conclude by offering perspectives for future research in the context of SIDS.  2 The economic value of the scuba diving industry The scuba diving industry is a crucial component of island states blue economy sectors. Scuba diving, notably on coral reefs and to view iconic marine species, represents a lucrative business attraction. It underpins the tourism sector in many SIDS, helping to generate 20–50% of gross domestic product (GDP) and over 30% of employment in the Cook Islands, Fiji, Palau, Maldives, Barbados Grenada, and Bahamas [37] . Across the Caribbean islands, for instance, scuba diving is estimated to contribute more than US$7.9 billion per annum to local economies [38] . More specifically, in the Bahamas, the scuba dive industry, mainly through shark tourism diving, contributes approximately USD 113.8 million annually to the Bahamian economy [39] . Alongside the SDG 14 commitments to mitigate the environmental threats faced by oceans, SIDS leaders, notably those of Fiji, Grenada and Palau, have recognised the sector interlinkages envisioned in SDG 14.7 target under the Coral Reef Life Declaration, a follow up political step for strengthening SDG 14 progress [40] . The declaration notes the profit side of the global coral reef tourism industry, acknowledging annual revenues of US$36 billion, of which $19 billion is directly derived from the scuba dive tourism industry, and the remainder coming from reef-linked seafood and other reef-associated activities [2,7,8] . Moreover, the declaration highlights the economic benefits of the high-value dive tourism industry and its interlinkages with reef linked seafood. The scuba diving industry also creates strong multiplier effects through linkages with the local economy resulting in a substantial number of jobs being created indirectly or in other sectors. A study by Nash et al.[30] , mapping SDG 14 interlinkages to SDG 1 concerning poverty reduction, acknowledged diving as an essential source of economic revenue for SIDS such as Fiji, where the marine tourism sector is the largest employer and contributor to the national GDP. Additionally, the small-scale dive fisheries workforce is essential in meeting the seafood industry demands, but its economic contributions are generally unrepresented in government GDP reporting [24,41] . Scuba dive industry contributions via dive fisheries are essential in seafood exports and often strongly aligned with the tourism sector, which is the destination of much of the reef-linked catch. In the Bahamas alone, the spiny lobster harvested by dive fishers is worth US$75–90 million, accounting for 40% of total exports and 60% of all the islands' fisheries landings [42] . The Bahamian lobster industry employs about 9000 dive fishers at the community level; however, the overall economic contribution of dive fisheries to the national GDP is poorly understood [42] . While the Bahamian lobster fishing industry is one of the first SIDS fisheries to become eco-labelled, the assessment for this distinction is unrelated to aspects such as the diving gear and labour used or the health and safety of the workforce [43] . The actual national economic contribution of the dive industry is likely far higher than the estimates highlighted above, especially with considerations of its interdependent and interlinked elements. Such as investments relating to dive safety management, gear, skills, and training and certification value. While the vital role of the scuba diving industry in realising both the blue economy and SDG14 has gained some political recognition by SIDS, there has been little attempt to explicitly align relevant skills and training of the labour force to secure decent work creation. Acknowledging the multiple, complex inter-relationships between SDGs (e.g. Ref.[28,29] ), we highlight SDG target 14.7 particularly as a catalyst for SDGs 8 and 14 in the context of SIDS diving industry. A conceptual framework (Fig. 1 ) in this context aims to enhance engagement of policymakers from domains of employment, labour, decent work, blue economy, scuba diving industry and ocean sustainability (for SDG interactions and policy use see Refs. [32,44,45] ).  3 Positioning Health and Safety for diving occupations within SDGs Scuba diving can be a high-risk occupation as divers are dependent on compressed air breathing systems [46,47] . SDG target 8.8 focuses on achieving policy outcomes that promote the demand for a safe and decent work environment, especially those in hazardous sectors and are highly vulnerable to occupational injuries[48] . Divers work under increased pressure (hyperbaric conditions) and in an open ocean environment, often remote from medical facilities. Consequently, drowning, physiological injury and fatality rates can be high under these conditions [47,49] . One of the occupational injuries that divers are at greater risk of is decompression sickness (also called the bends) [50] . When not treated urgently with emergency oxygen and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, the consequences can lead to paralysis and fatalities in the workplace [51,52] . Compressed-air diving is unforgiving to anyone ignoring established diving practices and safety procedures [25,53,54] . In light of the risks involved, occupational divers require industry-specific skills and training strategies and cooperation with a network of sectors, social partners, training centres, enterprises, and specialists related to safety [47,55] . For example, dive safety strategies require sectoral cooperation mechanisms with health ministries to support divers with recompression chamber infrastructure and hyperbaric medical expertise. Other national strategies to support the dive workers require sectoral cooperation mechanisms for safety at sea and rescue services. In developed countries diving for military, government, commercial, and scientific work are subjected to state labour and skills policies supported with laws and safety protocols [54] . No matter how diving work activity is classified, no one should engage in diving work unless properly trained and certified to meet the accreditation requirements by training agencies [47,53,54] . The enabling factors for the economic growth of the scuba diving industry are the investments placed in advancing skills and training for safe diving, coupled with ensuring the availability of reliable diving equipment alongside an attractive ocean environment [56–58] . At the national level, operationalising international industry-specific skill training standards depends on governance mechanisms and the capacity of national policymaking bodies such as labour authorities. Small island states are often geographically isolated and therefore far removed from diving industry training agencies, including specialised agencies on safety and engineering, creating added barriers to reaching critical safety measures for its labour force [59] . The Divers Alert Network (DAN), based in Europe, is the scuba diving industry's largest association globally invested to diving safety, serving divers with safety resources, emergency assistance, and medical research [60] . SIDS are primarily affiliated with the American agency, Professional Association of Dive Instructors (PADI) and DAN regional centres as their industry sector organisations. Dive safety training and certification governed by industry training bodies help build national capacity in modernising safety and preventing or reducing the risk of dive-related injuries. In developed countries, dive industry safety and the technical demands of scuba diving have led to national-level industry-based skills development strategies. For example, in association with Divers Alert Network Europe, Malta's tourism and hospitality educational centre in 2014 announced the first Bachelor of Science in Dive Safety Management programme to meet Malta's dive industry skill demands for economic development[61] . Analogously, the Australian Diver Accreditation Scheme (ADAS) has established safety and hyperbaric specific training for medical technicians, police diver and dive safety officers to support supervisory and safety enforcement roles [3] . The international Association of Scuba Services Engineers and Technicians (ASSET) supports the engineering skills development and diver’s safety equipment quality check and safe work programmes [62] . A further challenge for SIDS policymakers is that the scuba training agencies international governance architecture are fragmented [54,63–65] . In this context, government and industry cooperation mechanisms for monitoring labour skill supply, safety demand and market competition are critical. However, the scuba industry is self-regulating and such information is not readily accessible for SIDS governments and associated ocean forums to help inform the policymaking process [1] . In such circumstances, policymakers are not fully aware of the diving industry's contribution to the national labour force, and where data is available, it tends to face challenges in terms of reliability [66] . The worldwide proliferation of multiple dive training organisations with different governing frameworks and marketing strategies has become a confusing and highly competitive area to navigate [54,64,65] . Such gaps and complexities hinder island governments' knowledge on the supply and demand of industry-specific skills related to safety, decent work creation strategies, and policies. The following subsections highlight policy deficiencies in three diving sectors of island operations dive tourism, fisheries, and the public sector dive workforce, which requires a holistic national approach for future of diving work. 3.1 Dive Tourism labour force The advancements in diving safety procedures, mass participation and high value have led the World Trade Organization to recognise the scuba diving industry as one of the fastest-growing international tourism sectors [1] . In all jurisdictions and sectors, international diving training certifications and standards, including dive tourism and fisheries, require occupational and recreational divers to be safe from injury and unnecessary risks [54,60] . In addition, demand for the general duty of care calls for policies supporting workers to adhere to diving safety responsibilities and have professional acknowledgement in the national systems that provides for litigation supports following diving accidents or incidents [47,49,67] . Where policies for monitoring quality assurance in dive industry-based skills and procedures for safety operations are not regulated and bridged with the right infrastructure support, mitigating dive accidents will continue to face problems. In noting the scuba diving industry's overall national safety protocols using the European context, Lucrezi et al. [59]  found that very few dive centres supporting dive tourism were actively involved in safety campaigns or placed emphasises on diver safety procedures. While 60% of dive accidents in dive tourism were related to decompression sickness, most often, dive centres workforce and scuba diving clients were not within immediate reach of a hyperbaric chamber for oxygen therapy and immediate treatment[59] . Many cases go unreported as reporting accidents and fatalities has been voluntary, and this type of informal safety culture is often apparent in SIDS [59,60] . The national-level dive tourism sector faces other deficits in safety standards in the global south. Chronic tensions and conflicts over uneven education and dive skill certification level, language barriers, intensive safety and risk management responsibility due to the nature of the work environment, salary allocations, and lack of job security are common barriers to applying additional international standards [64,68] . While international dive training agencies govern dive safety, the national level mechanism and labour force for enforcing safety and quality control are not given priority in the SIDS by the industry. In addition, other decent work conditions hinder safety. Local island entrepreneur-led small and medium-sized dive operators find it hard to compete and cooperate with foreign-owned diving enterprises associated with chain hotels, cheap labour and corporate marketing strategies [69] . Multiple barriers indicate that the scuba dive industry requires several national policies to be coherently aligned to support the workforce and industry clients with dive safety.  3.2 Dive fisheries labour force SIDS live fish and coral aquarium trade together with aquaculture production for the global supply chain is estimated to be worth USD 200 million per year [70] , where the dive fishing workforce operate in unsafe conditions. Dive safety management is undermined in the case of commercial fisheries operations where the diving gear market predominantly lacks adequate safety checks and standards in the use of diving apparatus [57,71] . In many island fisheries, diving without proper training in the use of the diving apparatus or inadequate safety practices and adherence to standards causes hundreds of decompression accidents, resulting in death, partial and complete paralysis, and permanent neurological disability [71–74] . Studies by Forman [75] , Winkler [76]  and Bassett [73]  in island countries, such as the Grenadian dive fisheries primarily for lobsters in the Caribbean, have reported high rates of decompression injuries, with 81% of divers in the sector experiencing decompression sickness at least once, with many experiencing the issue multiple times. Further, Sloan and Tuivanualevu [77]  highlight the legal case where 12 fatalities are reported in one year in the Fiji Islands, with three times the fatality rate concerning divers in the sea cucumber industry[77] . Similarly, Marschke et al. [71]  highlight the case of commercial dive fishers not being protected from improper dive gear use and unacceptable forms of labour exploitation in the case of Jamaica's high value reef fisheries. Death and disability resulting from hazardous commercial dive fishing occupations in islands global supply chains of fisheries trade face ethical and human rights concerns [71,74,77] . The UN voluntary guidelines for securing sustainable small scale fisheries have accorded island states to address decent work deficits, occupational health and safety, and unfair working conditions [78] . A transformative policy outcome is needed in protecting the dive fishing workforce in SIDS, who are placing great hopes on their blue economy and, by extension, their underwater workforce pertaining to SDG target 14.7.  3.3 Public sector diving labour force As governments invest in interrelated SDG 14 targets, such as target 14.1 on marine pollution, 14.2 on healthy oceans, 14.4 on sustainable fisheries, 14.5 on marine protected areas, there is an increasing demand for training policies and systems supporting professional environmental divers. Efforts to establish marine protected areas, coral restoration initiatives, and invasive species removal under SDG targets further create the need for a decent underwater workforce consistent with SDG 8. Appropriate work standards for such, as it were, scientific/environmental diving activities are not necessarily available to those seeking work in the public sector, marine park operations, or within marine science in developing states [67,79] . Lack of formal recognition of diving for work occupations highlights a pressing need for national employment strategies to support islands blue economy sectors. In particular, quality assurance for skills training, occupational health and safety for hyperbaric workers, and appropriate insurance schemes would be consistent with SDG 8.   4 SDG 14.7 interlinkages for SIDS blue economy SIDS have traditionally faced shortages in terms of skilled labour force, and their heavy reliance on expatriate labour for new industries led island leaders to make decent work and economic growth a high priority agenda [37,80] . As exemplified by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), Decent Work Country Programs in the Pacific SIDS reflects the commitment to achieving the SDGs [35] . However, the scuba diving industry is not part of this dialogue on the future of work. There is a need for policy-level interventions with labour agencies and industry concerning skill investments strategies, workforce safety and health, engineering and infrastructure [1,7,59,68,81] . A key policy gap relates to where information concerning the diving industry labour force is generally unavailable for policymakers at both the international and developing states country levels [65] . It is suggested that SIDS policymakers lack this evidence from the scuba diving industry domain in order to build future mechanisms for industry-based skill and safety for its work below the water labour force. The SIDS Accelerated Modalities for Action (SAMOA) Pathway that provides policy guidance specific to island governments is the starting point for establishing interlinkage between blue economic sectors, industries, decent work principles and ocean sustainability [23,82,83] . Of particular note in this context, SDG target 14.7 explicitly calls for the international community to increase the economic benefits to SIDS by reducing the separation between blue economy sectors and provide support for industries within the context in which they are operating so that they can better support healthy job creation [14] . Those tasked with implementing SDG 8 recognise that decent work and healthy job creation are central for the global south to transition towards sustainable use of oceans [23,34,84,85] . However, there is arguably a lack of awareness concerning the case of the scuba diving industry and its role in the current and future blue economies of islands. These challenges give rise to an increasingly urgent need for the development of national and international level strategies on decent work to foster the future of work for SDG 14 and target 14.7 specific for SIDS. Pioneered by SIDS, the blue economy concept offers the potential to implement policy reforms needed for the scuba diving industry. The blue economy encompasses all ocean-related economic activities which are dependent on marine education training and maritime safety agencies [86,87] . Via Fig. 1 , a key initial step emerges in the case of islands dive fishers work conditions, which is accorded within SDG 8.7 target where governments need to take immediate and effective means to abolish, control and limit unsafe working conditions (e.g. Ref.[77] ) pertaining to the blue economy. In this regard, other interdependencies need to be explored to help abolish unsafe and unhealthy work concerning SDG 14, using functional and high priority SDG interlinkages as argued by Elder et al. [32] . Developing countries can align SDG interlinkages that support the pooling of financial and infrastructure resources [32] . It is also important in this context to highlight target SDG 8 (a) that urges wealthier nations to increase aid for trade-related technical assistance. SDG target 8.2 that supports technological upgrading for high value-added and labour-intensive sectors [48]  and target SDG 14. b pertaining to the small-scale fisheries, global supply chains, and economic productivity [85] . SDG 8 and 14 interlinkages, directly connected via target 14.7 (i.e., Fig. 1 ), encourages policymakers to position the scuba diving industry in the blue economy policies of islands governments and alongside international standards of decent work. These SDG targets further island governments engagements to seek assistance with industry, academia, the ILO concerning the high-value future of work below water labour force needs. However, further research is needed to understand the context and interpretation of SDG targets in a holistic manner to further support the impact of the interactions for policy process.  5 International Organisations and the scuba diving industry The ILO is the specialised UN agency that oversees the decent work creation and the progress of SDG 8 at the country level. [34] . Previous studies have identified the need for ILO’s decent work creation programs to be linked with divers work [71,88] . To understand whether, under SDG 14, the scuba diving industry and the need for decent work creation for work below water labour force are on the political radar of the ILO and related UN agencies, an assessment was made of an SDG 14 policy-level discussions held at the 2017 UN Ocean Conference (UNOC). The ILO and UNDP led the discussions on decent work (SDG 8), and blue economy were assessed using content analysis. The ILO flagged to member states that there are significant decent work deficits for many ocean workers in high-risk occupations and these deficits persist where violations of human and labour rights, increased frequency of accidents, and fatality rates are fundamental concerns [89] . The ILO urged member states to implement their responsibilities under the Work in Fishing Convention 2007 (No.188) pertaining to commercial fishing and standards governing working conditions on fishing vessel where ILO has accorded fishing as a hazardous occupation, consistent with key SDG target 8.8 addressing labour protection and safety. However, no explicit recognition of the particular circumstances of scuba diving for work was made. In addition, no mention of the scuba diving industry, decent work creation for divers, or provisions for dive safety was made after the ILO statement delivery, followed by the high panel debate and consensus-building for future work. Consequently, it appears that decent work deficits in island small-scale dive fisheries and small-scale diving enterprises under tourism sectors were very much “out of sight, out of mind” during the UNOC and were essentially ignored. The policy agenda setting and process of the week-long UNOC aimed to build momentum on the implementation of SDG 14. Consequently, discussions were heavily focused on protecting the ocean, with less attention to workers who are the agents to help transition towards a sustainable blue economy [89] . For instance, six out of seven UNOC partnerships or political streams focused on restoring near-shore marine ecosystems to enhance climate security for SIDS, linking environmental SDGs only covering the climate, oceans, and land [90] . Following the UNOC, UN agencies recognised the dive industry's essential and growing role-specific to the tourism and business sectors [91,92] . Consequently, the 2017 UN international year of sustainable tourism forecasted that the dive-tourism industry could stimulate economic growth and create decent jobs, as illustrated by the certification of one million newly qualified divers each year [93] . The recognition of the economic growth of the dive tourism industry led UN Environment Programme to flagship coral reef ecosystems via the Green Fins initiative [91] . This initiative, spearheaded by international NGOs in partnership with PADI, a private sector entity, developed environment certification schemes with a view to greening the scuba diving industry [91,94] . In advancing the UNOC outcomes, PADI introduced a decade of ocean action platform to achieve the conservation goals of SDG 14, supporting the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development [94] . SIDS policymakers may see the UNEP initiative and funding for greening schemes as a welcome step from PADI. However, the likelihood for such investments to bridge decent work deficits in islands underwater workforce that can help transition to environmental sustainability is low. Due to a lack of skilled workers in SIDS, many past green projects have not been implemented successfully [35] . Baum et al. [95]  argue that UN World Tourism Organisation has proved negligent on work and labour and highlighted that decent work creation continues to be unmet in many aspects of the tourism sector. The work of Cisneros-Montemayor et al. [96]  further explores equity and sustainability guidelines concerning blue economy sectors, including the UN ecotourism resolution. Further research is needed to understand how intergovernmental organisations working on oceans position themselves on the attainment of SDG interlinkages that directly impact the SIDS national policy process.  6 Conclusion: Work below water to deliver blue economy outcomes The scuba diving industry is an increasingly important part of the blue economy [67,97]  which necessitates safe diving for work conditions under technical, legal and social obligations of decent work and economic prosperity. SIDS have multiple policy deficits concerning scuba diving industry-based skills and safety underpinning decent work, future job creation and employability. The scuba diving industry is dependent on a highly skilled and safe workforce to help successfully deliver SIDS blue economy aspirations. This paper makes the case that SDG target 14.7 provides the basis for interlinkages between SDG 8 pertaining to decent work as per the principles of the ILO program of work and SDG 14 in the case of the scuba diving industry. We highlight the potential use of Fig. 1 , in providing a relatively simple conceptual framework offering clarity for SIDS policy makers and their development partners in visualising the interlinkages among functional and foundational SDGs. A failure for SIDS to make headway on bringing SDG 8 and 14 interlinkages at the forefront for their work below water labour force under their emerging blue economy plans impedes their progress on both decent work creation and ocean sustainability. Neglecting the relationship between these foundational SDGs (i.e., Fig. 1 ) limits governments in maximising their aid for trade partnerships and SDG 14 investments in creating necessary conditions to prevent unhealthy and unsafe work conditions. Such as resources for modernising the work below water labour force and needs concerning occupational dive safety and risk mitigation systems. Following which the SDG 14 labour force in islands will continue to face precarious conditions hindering to meet progress in other SDGs such as decreasing inequalities (SDG 10), improving education (SDG 4), health and well-being (SDG 3), and overall progress envision under Agenda 2030. In moving forward SIDS leaders urgently need to prioritise the interlinkages that SDG 14.7 target creates in stimulating engagements for policies needed in supporting the governance of labour matters with ILO and UN agencies to ensure blue economy pathways are truly sustainable, both environmentally and socially. SDG 8 and 14 interlinkages, via target 14.7 helps brings clarity on the importance of ensuring national-level policy integration between all different sectors the interlinkages represent, to avoid the additional social burdens on island communities’ wellbeing. Additionally, the interlinkages widen the scope for scuba diving training agencies, industry partners, UN agencies to engage and account for social sustainability within islands blue economy development plans. Islands work below water labour force across all the sectors pertaining to SDG 14 are a natural fit for accelerating engagement across stakeholders. A coalition of island stakeholders, including interdisciplinary marine scientists, labour practitioners, scuba dive professionals, artisanal dive leaders, dive fishers, dive training agencies, and technical authorities collectively can support governments in building national decent work programmes such as blue apprenticeship training schemes. In addition, island scuba diving educators, technical experts such as hyperbaric medical, engineers, and dive safety officers can map SDG14 occupational skills strategy for islands work safety programmes under their blue economy sectors. SDG 14.7 brings a sense of urgency for further inter and transdisciplinary research agendas to be prioritised by island governments to advance strategies for their future work below water labour force. Ultimately, using SDG target 14.7 as a bridge between SDG 8 and SDG 14 policy domains highlights the value for creating synergies and partnerships between the three dimensions of sustainability: people, planet, and profit.
