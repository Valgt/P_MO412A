                  The Sustainable Development Goals have been developed with the aim of ensuring that no individual living in the world is left behind from the social, economic and environmental gains achieved. Accessible and Clean Energy, the Sustainable Development Goal-7 (SDG-7), aims to provide accessible, reliable and sustainable energy for all. In this study, SDG-7 and its indicators are analyzed with multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach. This study reveals a novel MCDM model that can be used in prioritizing indicators to achieve the United Nation's sustainable development goals. For this purpose, one of the MCDM models, Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) is extended under Fermatean Fuzzy (FF) environment. By this way, FF-SWARA is proposed into the literature as a novel weighting methodology. Then, indicators are prioritized by FF-SWARA based on expert opinions. As a result, “access to electricity” and “renewable energy share” are determined as the most important indicators to achieve SDG-7. Also, managerial and practical insights are presented for Turkey.

Accessible and Clean Energy, the Sustainable Development Goal-7 (SDG-7), aims to provide accessible, reliable and sustainable energy for all. In this study, SDG-7 and its indicators are analyzed with multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach. This study reveals a novel MCDM model that can be used in prioritizing indicators to achieve the United Nation's sustainable development goals. For this purpose, one of the MCDM models, Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) is extended under Fermatean Fuzzy (FF) environment. By this way, FF-SWARA is proposed into the literature as a novel weighting methodology. Then, indicators are prioritized by FF-SWARA based on expert opinions. As a result, “access to electricity” and “renewable energy share” are determined as the most important indicators to achieve SDG-7. Also, managerial and practical insights are presented for Turkey.

The goals have been developed with the aim of ensuring that no individual living in the world is left behind from the social, economic and environmental gains achieved. While determining these goals, the UN has taken into account that every segment of society should be involved in development in order for development to be sustainable. For this reason, by trying to be inclusive, it has determined the target audience as all people and displayed an approach based on solving the common problems of all people. The goals are presented in Fig. 1  . As Fig. 1  shows, 7th goal is “Affordable and Clean Energy”. This goal has been defined by the United Nations as follows: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all  [1 ].  Considering “Energy”, which is not examined under a separate heading in the “Millennium Development Goals”, as a separate objective in the SDGs, is a critical step taken to follow this issue with clearer targets and indicators instead of a limited focus. Energy plays a vital role to function modern economies and is naturally related to other SDGs [3 ]. Energy ensures the development of societies by decreasing the poverty and increasing social equality [4 ]. With the arrival and usage of electricity, poor societies might have a higher degree of economic sustainability and an increase in the quality of life of society [5 ]. Since the industrial revolution, fossil fuels have been helpful in lifting society out of poverty and have enabled improvements in health, education, and nearly every aspect of human life. Today, fossil fuels are the most used fuels as an energy source (approximately 85% of the total consumption), especially in heating, production, transportation and almost every activity [6 ]. However, the contribution of energy produced from fossil fuels to economic and social development should not be considered independently of its environmental impact by generating pollutant gases, such as SO2 , CO, NOX , HC, and CO2  [7 ]. The increasing carbon level in the atmosphere causes a climate change that threatens the ecosystem [8 ,9 ]. Ecosystem disruption causes social turmoil and economic instability [10 ], so a shift to low-emission and low-impact energy sources has become inevitable to sustain the gains of past centuries and to achieve most of SDGs in three main dimensions: economic, social and environmental [11 ]. Energy provided from burning fossil fuels is the source of more than half of the total global greenhouse gas emissions (D [12 ]. Simultaneously, obtaining energy to the billions who don't have access to it is critical to the creation of new markets and the spread of financial well-being. However, according to the 2015 progress report, the world lags far behind what is needed to reach the 2030 targets. Approximately 1.1 billion people are deprived of any form of access to electricity [13 ], while 2.9 billion people, most of whom live in rural areas of Africa and Asia, do not have access to clean cooking fuels (i.e. electricity and gas) [14 ,15 ]. Annual global investment meets only one-third of what is needed to meet energy access, efficiency and sustainability targets [16 ]. The goals within the scope of SDG-7 can be evaluated under different themes such as reaching energy services to all segments of society, increasing the share of renewable energy in total energy production and consumption, and reducing energy intensity by improving energy efficiency practices [17 ]. It is aimed to provide reliable, sustainable and accessible energy for everyone [18 ]. It has been stated that clean energy and a well-organized energy distribution network will reduce carbon emissions and reduce the danger to humans and the environment within the scope of SDG-7. SDG-7 has five different targets and six indicators related to these targets. The targets and indicators are given in Fig. 2  . Considering the energy trilemma, the security of energy supply should be also considered, particularly, when renewables are integrated. The concept of energy security has been expanded over time with macroeconomic developments and started to be used synonymously with energy supply security. Therefore, energy security is expressed as a concept that covers four factors such as the availability, accessibility, affordability and acceptability of the energy source [19 ]. Energy supply security has become a vital as it affects the economic growth and development of countries and their national security [20 ]. In this context, countries should be able to obtain energy from uninterrupted, reliable, cheap, clean from various sources [21–23 ]. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the presence of sustainable energy systems in the energy sector, which are rapidly developing and contribute to mitigating the effects of climate change [24 ]. The closure of some sectors due to the economic downturn reduced energy demand. The pandemic has slowed the transition to a global sustainable low-carbon energy system due to disruptions in the global economy's supply chain [25 ]. The pandemic and its aftermath are a critical period for sustainable energy transition policies. It has become a necessity to design new energy systems in a more efficient way, taking into account carbon emissions. Considering the investments to be made during the post-pandemic recovery period, it offers an opportunity to focus on green growth, especially in energy [26 ]. Furthermore, electricity demand is naturally related to gas prices due to its significant share in the current electricity generation mix [27 ]. Oil and gas prices have direct effects on renewable energy investments [28 ]. The pandemic has shown that renewable energy is safer and cheaper for both investors and consumers [29 ]. Considering the dependency in gas supply and the increase in gas prices, it would be realistic to expect renewable energy investments to continue increasingly. Thus, the progress of both SDG-7 and other energy-related goals will accelerated. To achieve SDG-7, six different indicators of five targets under the title of SDG-7 should be measured and evaluated. In this context, it is inevitable to think that each indicator has a different effect on the achievement of the ultimate goal as SDG-7. In this study, the importance of indicators are analyzed based on experts' opinion. For this purpose, prioritizing problem for indicators of SDG-7 is modeled as a decision-making problem. Then, this model is solved by multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach. To handle this problem, well-known weight determination technique Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) is extended under Fermatean Fuzzy (FF) environment and a novel group decision-making methodology, namely, FF-SWARA, is introduced into the literature. Finally, the indicators of SDG-7 are prioritized via FF-SWARA based on multiple experts’ opinions. In this study, an extended fuzzy based approach is utilized to reflect the fuzziness and ambiguity in the evaluations in the most appropriate way, instead of using traditional fuzzy logic. Fermeatean fuzzy logic is used to convert linguistic terms to the mathematical definition in the best way. FF set theory is proven as one of the most powerful fuzzy sets to cope with the uncertainty in imprecise information [30 ]. FF numbers can be used to describe input variables for uncertain issues to handle the ambiguity in the complex decision-making problems. In this approach, the indeterminacy degree can be determined independently, unlike the most of other fuzzy approaches [31 ,32 ]. FF sets provide decision-makers more freedom by assigning parameters from a larger domain, thus decision-makers can express their opinion on membership and non-membership with respect to the status of subject [33 ]. As a novel approach, FF numbers can be used to reflect vague, reliable, and inexact assessment information by their relaxed and modified conditions [34 ]. As a result, FF sets are preferred to reflect uncertainties of information [35 ] of the proposed problem. Using FF sets offer an advanced evaluation of indicators' priorities and more efficient assessment of indicators’ weight. The organization of this study can be summarized as follows. Detailed literature review on MCDM applications that consider energy-related SDG topics is presented in Section 2 . The theoretical background of FF sets and related literature about FF sets is given in Section 3 . Section 4  introduces the novel FF-SWARA methodology in details. Section 5  presents the real case application for Turkey of the proposed FF-SWARA based indicator prioritization methodology. The practical implications for Turkey are given in Section 6 . Lastly, Section 7  summarizes the conclusion and shows future remarks.  2 Related studies Guzmán-Sánchez et al. [36 ] evaluate the different flat roof types in terms of SDGs. They determine criteria weights with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and determine the best alternative by Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Embodied carbon and embodied energy are the two criteria of criteria set to evaluate roof types. Seventeen criteria are determined for flat roofs and four alternatives are evaluated by weighting these criteria. Büyüközkan et al. [37 ] evaluate four different renewable energy types ad wind, solar, biogas, and hydro to achieve SDG-7 for Turkey. They determine four main criteria (economic, environmental, sociopolitical, and technical) and five sub-criteria for each main criterion to determine the best alternatives. Criteria are weighted with AHP and alternatives are ranked by Complex Proportional Assessment (COPRAS) using hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set. In this study, while the criteria determined by the author(s) as a result of the literature review are taken into account, a specific evaluation for targets and indicators for SDG-7 is not presented. Numata et al. [38 ] determine and evaluate the barriers to mini-grid deployment in Myanmar. Regulatory, technical, social/cultural, financial, economic barriers and their inner barriers are prioritized by both AHP and cluster analysis. They indicate that there are multiple important barriers to implementing mini-grid deployment in Myanmar, and experts are not reached a consensus yet to determine the greatest barriers. In this study, evaluations are made for a specific country based on mini-grid deployment. Furthermore, fuzziness and uncertainty in the expert evaluation are not considered in this study. Ahmed et al. [39 ] prioritize the climate change policy objectives by Fuzzy AHP to secure and achieve Paris agreement and SDGs. They analyze the energy, transport, urban & town planning, industry, agriculture objectives and inner objectives of them for Pakistan. They determine the “energy” as the most important main objective. Then, seven different policies are ranked with respect to predetermined main and inner objectives, and their weights. Climate change and other related issues are analyzed and strategies are examined. Deeper analyzes can be made by conducting studies on the energy focus. Balali & Valipour [40 ] conduct analysis to prioritize building façade's smart materials according to SDGs for Iran. Five main and thirty-eight sub criteria are eliminated by the Friedman test score and the most important ten criteria are used to determine best material among six alternatives by AHP. The main focus of this study is limited with construction industry. Kabir et al. [41 ] explain different smart power management technologies, operations and applications of them for Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) countries. They perform a Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) analysis to determine challenges and benefits and AHP is employed to determine the weight of SWOT factors. Then, different technologies are evaluated by Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS). Advanced Metering Infrastructure is determined as the best smart power management technology among five different technologies. The analysis are performed for smart power management oriented. Madurai Elavarasan et al. [42 ] focus on energy sustainability for SDG-7 and perform SWOT-AHP analysis. They indicate that “Increasing preferences to harvest solar and wind energy” is the most important factor in their analysis. The energy sector's effect of other SDGs is also analyzed for each SDG. Again, prioritization of indicators and fuzziness and uncertainty in the expert evaluation are not considered in this study. Mangla et al. [43 ] indicate clean energy as one of the major factors to achieve SDGs and determine eighteen different indicators under the five main subjects. They use grey Decision Making Experiment and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) to analyze the causal interaction among indicators. Developing system capabilities and adoption of energy management systems are determined most important indicators for achieving clean energy-related SDGs. Khan & Kabir [44 ] evaluate waste-to-energy generation technologies to achieve SDGs, especially electricity and waste management. They classify related SDG indicators under three titles, as Economic, environmental, and social. Simple Multi Attribute Rating Technique Exploiting Ranks (SMARTER) is used to rank indicators, then four waste-to-energy generation technologies are evaluated with respect to weighted indicators. SDG-11, “By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management”  [1 ] is focused in this study and implications are presented based on SDG-11. Kumar et al. [45 ] develop a strategy to evaluate sustainable supply chain indicators considering the SDGs. TOPIS is used to rank supply chain indicators under fuzzy environment. Energy, greenhouse gas emissions, natural resource management are determined as most important sustainability indicators. Automobile sector is main focus on this study. Social, environmental, economic and quality indicators are handled together by considering all SDGs and the problem is modeled with a holistic perspective. Schöne et al. [46 ] focus on especially SDG-7 and analyze all SDGs by using Specific Measurable Accepted Realistic Timely (SMART) framework. 247 indicators to achieve all SDGs are evaluated and 58 of them are determined as related to access-to-energy projects. While focusing on the potential impacts of the projects in this study, the importance levels of the indicators are not taken into account. Bhagaloo et al. [47 ] analyze resource efficiency as a guide to achieve SDG-7. They determine that to promote the sustainable operations of the Trinidad and Tobago energy sector as a small island developing states, more resources and a shift to more energy efficient process engineering would be beneficial. They state that their work could be extended using MCDM methods. When the outputs of the literature review are analyzed, it can be concluded that the MCDM based approaches are frequently used to evaluate various problems related to different SDGs. Successful results are obtained in different application areas such as construction, mini-grid deployment, climate change policy, power technologies, renewable energy or supply chain by applying many MCDM approaches. Besides, this approach is encountered in studies of prioritizing the sustainable development goals [48 ]. Additionally, many different methods such as SWOT, SMARTER and SMART are used together with the MCDM approaches to solve problems related to SDG-7. In addition to these, it can be seen from the aforementioned studies that MCDM approaches are utilized in many studies by many authors. One of the reasons why MCDM approaches are used more among alternative methodologies can be shown as providing a systematic solution procedure to the problem by creating a hierarchical structure in the solution of problems with conflicting criteria and goals. In cases where there are more than one goal/criterion/indicator that conflict with each other, the weighting/prioritizing problem can be easily solved by using MCDM approaches to evaluate goals/criteria/indicators. As a result of MCDM oriented SDG-7 literature review, following research gaps are observed. Evaluating indicators’ effects to achieve ultimate goal are not analyzed in the current energy literature. Furthermore, current situation of SDG-7 is not evaluated for post pandemic era. Also, country-based analysis for the current situation is not seen in the literature. Therefore, novel group decision making methodology is presented to prioritize the indicators of SDG-7 for the first time in the literature. In this study, determining importance level of each indicator are aimed by the proposed FF-SWARA. The focus of this study to answer the following research questions in terms of energy efficiency. (i) What is the impact of each indicator on achieving the ultimate goal of SDG-7? (ii) Has the pandemic affected SDG-7? (iii) What is the current status of SDG-7 for Turkey? As a result of the comprehensive literature review, no study is found for the indicators prioritization of any SDG. Furthermore, there is no study that focuses SDG-7, especially post COVID-19 era. In addition, FF sets are never utilized to reflect uncertainty in the process in SDG related studies. Based on these two gaps, this study presents novelties to the current literature in terms of both the proposed methodology and application area. To the best of authors’ knowledge, there is no study that extends SWARA under fermatean fuzzy environment. With this study, FF-SWARA is introduced to the decision-making literature.  3 Fermatean fuzzy sets Fuzzy logic is a successful method in the control of processes when the information is complex, nonlinear, and difficult to model and the nature of the information is uncertain or unclear. The logic uses approximate thinking instead of thinking based on exact values. Qualitative assessment and subjective judgment can be presented with the fuzzy logic in the evaluation processes of complex decision-making problems. Information is in the form of linguistic expressions (important, small, very little, etc.) in fuzzy logic. Linguistic expressions can be defined with different fuzzy sets to handle fuzziness and uncertainty in information [49 ]. In traditional fuzzy sets, only the membership function ( μ )     is used to determine the membership degree of an element to the set and the non-membership degree of element to the set can be calculated by 1 − μ   . However, using only the membership function may be insufficient to represent the fuzziness in the same situations. Therefore Atanassov [50 ], introduced the intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) set theory by generalizing the fuzzy set theory. Besides the membership function, non-membership function ( v )     is used to define an element in IF sets. The degree of both functions can take value in the [0,1] range. Atanassov added the third function called as hesitancy ( π )     to complete the sum of membership and non-membership degree to 1.Definition 1 An IF number in fixed set X is presented as I ˜     in Eq. (1) . IF numbers are considered as the components of the IF sets for the simplicity:(1) I ˜  ≅ { x , μ I ˜   ( x )  , v I ˜   ( x )  ; x ∈ X  }      μ I ˜   ( x )  : X ↦ [ 0,1 ]     and v I ˜   ( x )  : X ↦ [ 0,1 ]     define the degree of membership and non-membership of the element x ∈ X    to I ˜    .where;(2) 0 ≤ μ I ˜   ( x )  + v I ˜   ( x )  ≤ 1 ; x ∈ X      The degree of hesitancy is calculated:(3) π I ˜   x  = 1 − μ I ˜   x  − v I ˜   x      [51 ] introduced pythagorean fuzzy (PF) sets that derived from IF sets. The sum of membership and non-membership degrees can exceed 1 in PF sets, but the sum of their squares cannot exceed 1 [52 ,53 ]:  Definition 2 A PF number in fixed set X is presented as P ˜     [54 ]:(4) P ˜  ≈ { x , μ p ˜   ( x )  ,  v p ˜   ( x )  ; x ∈ X  }      μ P ˜   ( x )  : X ↦ [ 0,1 ]     and v P ˜   ( x )  : X ↦ [ 0,1 ]     define the degree of membership and non-membership of the element x ∈ X    to P ˜    .where;(5) 0 ≤ μ p ˜   ( x )  2  + v p ˜   ( x )  2  ≤ 1      The degree of hesitancy is calculated:(6) π p ˜   ( x )  =  1 − μ p ˜   ( x )  2  − v p ˜   ( x )  2           3.1 Preliminaries of fermatean fuzzy sets The concept of FF sets was developed as a generalization of IF sets and PF sets by Senapati and Yager [55 ,56 ]. This set can be described as an innovative approach to representing unreliable, inexact and vague information under fuzzy environment [34 ,35 ].Definition 3 An FF number in fixed set X is presented as F ˜     in Eq. (1) . [55 ]:(7) F ˜  ≅ { x , μ F ˜   ( x )  , v F ˜   ( x )  ; x ∈ X  }      μ F ˜   ( x )  : X ↦ [ 0,1 ]     and v F ˜   ( x )  : X ↦ [ 0,1 ]     define the degree of membership and non-membership of the element x ∈ X    to F ˜    .where;(8) 0 ≤ μ F ˜   ( x )  3  + v F ˜   ( x )  3  ≤ 1      The degree of hesitancy is calculated:(9) π p ˜   ( x )  =  1 − ( μ F ˜   ( x )  )  3  + ( v F ˜   ( x )  3  )  3        Definition 4 Multiplication by scalar ( λ ≥ 0 )    of a FF Number α ˜  = ( μ α ˜   , v α ˜    )     [35 ]:(10) λ α ˜  = ( 1 − ( 1 − μ α ˜  3   )  λ   3  , v α ˜  λ   )        Definition 5 The power ( λ ≥ 0 )    of a FF Number α ˜  = ( μ α ˜   , v α ˜    )     [35 ]:(11) α ˜  λ  = ( μ α ˜  λ  , 1 − ( 1 − v α ˜  3   )  λ   3   )        Definition 6 The score function of a FF Number α ˜  = ( μ α ˜   , v α ˜    )     [55 ].(12) S ( α ˜  )  = μ α ˜  3  − v α ˜  3        Definition 7 The positive score function of a FF Number α ˜  = ( μ α ˜   , v α ˜    )     [57 ].(13) S +  ( α ˜  )  = 1 + S ( α ˜  )  = 1 + μ α ˜  3  − v α ˜  3        Definition 8 Summation and multiplication of two FF numbers α ˜  = ( μ α ˜   , v α ˜   )     and β ˜  = ( μ β ˜   , v β ˜   )     are given [58 ]: Summation:(14) α ˜  ⊕ β ˜  = ( μ α ˜  3  + μ β ˜  3  − μ α ˜  3  μ β ˜  3   3  , v α ˜   v β ˜    )       Multiplication: (15) α ˜  ⊗ β ˜  = ( μ α ˜   μ β ˜   , v α ˜  3  + v β ˜  3  − v α ˜  3  v β ˜  3   3   )          3.2 MCDM studies based on fermatean fuzzy sets Sometimes, traditional fuzzy sets cannot be used in contradictory decision-making environments. Because of sum and/or quadratic sum of degrees of function is limited. This situation restricts the decision maker's space. In FF sets, there are no upper limits for the sum and quadratic sum of functions. Nonetheless, the sum of membership and non-membership degree's cannot exceed 1. With this advantage, FF sets provide a more freedom for decision-makers. Linguistic terms used by decision makers for evaluation can be converted into mathematical expressions by FF sets. Many academicians and researchers use FF sets in their studies, as given in Table 1  . According to a detailed review of MCDM studies that use FF sets, there is no study that uses SWARA under FF environment. So, in this study, novel MCDM methodology is introduced, namely, FF-SWARA, which is developed for the first time to determine the weights of criteria in contradictory decision-making environments. Besides, using a fuzzy MCDM approach for the first time for prioritizing indicators of Energy as a sustainable development goal-7 is one of the first innovations made in this study. Therefore, this study presents novelties in terms of both the methodological and the field of application.   4 Fermatean fuzzy group decision-making methodology The proposed FF-SWARA based decision-making methodology includes three main phases. In the first phase, the indicators are considered as evaluation criteria. Then, the experts are evaluated according to their experience and qualifications, unlike the most of group decision making approaches. In this phase, the expert reputations (weights) are determined, unlike most of the available approaches that use equal expert weights or assume that the expert reputation vector is known. Lastly, FF-SWARA methodology is employed to determine the weight of each indicator for Sustainable Development Goal-7. A flowchart of the proposed methodology is given in Fig. 3  . The proposed methodology is explained in details in the following sub-sections. SWARA is one of the MCDM methods used for determining the criteria weights and ranking them in importance order. SWARA was developed by Ref. [78 ] as a decision maker-oriented subjective decision-making method. SWARA gives decision-makers the opportunity to choose their own priorities, considering the current conditions. Additionally, the roles of experts determined as decision-makers are even more important in this method [79 ]. Because the main feature of this method is the use of expert opinions in determining criteria weights. SWARA is extended under different fuzzy environments to handle uncertainty. [80 ] utilize SWARA with traditional fuzzy sets to solve the logistic provider selection problem. (Pratibha [81 ] present performance evaluation model that based hybrid SWARA-VIKOR hybrid methodology under Pythagorean fuzzy environment. [82 ] use intuitionistic fuzzy SWARA-COPRAS to evaluate the sustainability of the bioenergy production. [83 ] utilize hesitant fuzzy sets to extend failure mode and effect analysis. In this study, FF-SWARA is utilized to determine importance weight of main and sub-criteria for each level of the hierarchy. The steps of FF-SWARA that also includes expert evaluation as follows:Step 1. Experts are evaluated and the weight (reputation) for each expert are determined. Table 2   is used to differentiate experts with respect to their experience and qualifications.    Then, the following equation is used to determine the weight (reputation) of each expert. Let d    be the number of experts, and E t  = ( μ t  , v t   )     be the corresponding FF number to determine weight of expert t    based on evaluation. At this step, each expert is evaluated as individually, and the weight of expert is determined.(16) ψ t  = S +  ( E t  )   ∑  t = 1  d  S +  ( E t  )    = 1 + μ t 3  − v t 3   ∑  t = 1  d  ( 1 + μ t 3  − v t 3   )        Step 2. Construct a decision matrix by taking opinions from experts about each criterion using linguistic terms given in Table 3   [35 ]. Let A i t   = ( μ it  , v it   )     be an evaluation of criterion i    by expert t   . The scale given in Table 3  is used to convert linguistic terms to the FF numbers.    Step 3. Expert opinions about criteria are aggregated to construct FF decision matrix. Aggregation is performed by considering weight of each expert ( ψ t  )   .   (17) z i  = Y ( μ i  , v i   )  = ( ∏  t = 1  d  ( μ i t   )  ψ t   , 1 − ∏  t = 1  d  ( 1 − ( v i t   )  3   )  ψ t    3   )  , i = 1 , … , n     where z i     represents the aggregated evaluation for criterion i    and n    represents the number of criteria.Step 4. Positive score S +  ( i )     of each criterion is calculated by Equation (13) .   (18) S +  ( i )  = 1 + μ i 3  − v i 3      Step 5. Criteria are ranked in descending order according to positive score values.  Step 6. The comparative significance ( c i  )     of positive score value for each criterion is determined from the second preferred criteria by differencing positive score values S +  ( i )     of criterion ( i )    and ( i − 1 )  .     Step 7. The comparative coefficient ( k i  )     for each criterion is calculated.   (19) k i  = { 1 ,  i = 1    S +  ( i )  + 1 ,  i > 1          Step 8. Recalculated weights ( q i  )     are estimated.   (20) q i  = { 1 ,  i = 1    q ( i − 1 )   k i   ,  i > 1          Step 9. Final criteria weights are determined.   (21) w i  = q i  ∑  i = 1  n  q i        where n    denotes the number of criteria.  5 The importance determination by FF-SWARA First, an expert group consisting of three experts is formed to get their opinions on aforementioned SDG-7 indicators. The expert group includes two academicians from different departments of universities and one manager from the public energy company. Both academicians study on energy efficiency and renewable energy-related topics. The manager works on electricity distribution operations for public companies in İstanbul, Turkey. Interviews are conducted with the expert group to get their opinions. Expert opinions are taken by face-to-face interviews. Nevertheless, remote interview is conducted with the one expert to take opinions about indicators, due to pandemic conditions.Step 1. The experts are evaluated according to their experiences using Table 2 . Three experts are evaluated as MS, VS, and S respectively. Then, the weights of experts (E−1, E−2, E−3) are determined by Equation (16) , which are given as 0.459, 0.342, and 0.199.  Step 2. Firstly, each expert evaluates the indicators and decides the importance of each indicator. Indicators are evaluated by the experts using linguistic terms given in Table 3 . Then, linguistic terms are converted to FF numbers using the scale given in Table 3 . Table 4   presents the evaluations of indicator by each expert.    Step 3. Equation (17)  is used to aggregate expert evaluation of indicators (given in Table 5  ) by considering the weights of experts. Table 6  shows the aggregated FF importance evaluation of indicators.    Step 4–8. The positive score values of indicators are calculated using Equations (12) and (13 ). Then, indicators are ordered according to their score values in descending order. The steps 4–8 of FF-SWARA are applied as given in Table 6  .    Step 9. Lastly, the recalculated weights are normalized by Eq. (24) to determine final weight of each indicator. Fig. 4   presents the weight of each indicator.     6 Results As shown in Fig. 4 , Indicator 7.1.1 “Proportion of population with access to electricity” is determined as the most important indicator to achieve SDG-7 with the 25.6% importance level among the six indicators. Accessibility to electricity is important in meeting basic needs. The importance of accessibility to electricity has been understood, especially with the COVID-19 pandemic. The fight against the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing differently for many countries around the world. Resources and infrastructure are also critical indicators of how well countries can cope with the virus. It was also remembered that, especially in this process, access to electricity and food hygiene are of vital importance. Because hospitals are operating at full capacity. COVID-19 patients who need respiratory support live on these electrically powered devices [84 ]. According to a World Bank study, as of 2018, approximately 790 million people worldwide do not have access to electricity [85 ]. That was 1.2 billion in 2010. In other words, there is a serious disadvantage for treating COVID-19. Electricity consumption has also increased for those who do not leave their homes due to quarantine. There is no need to emphasize the importance of both personal hygiene and food hygiene. In the first year of the pandemic, restaurants and cafes were closed in most countries. In this process, those who could not leave their home or who worked from home cooked their own meals. The importance of a healthy diet to keep the immune system strong has been understood over and over again. 7.2.1 “Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption” is determined the second most important indicator to achieve SDG-7. After the 2000s, the search for alternative energy gained momentum and studies on renewable energy began to increase. It is possible to define renewable energy as “an energy source that can be obtained from natural sources and can renew itself continuously” [86 ]. Renewable energy has an extremely important place in terms of meeting the energy needs of countries with domestic resources, reducing their dependence on foreign sources, ensuring sustainable energy use by diversifying resources, and minimizing the damage to the environment because of energy consumption. The most important feature that distinguishes renewable energy from other types of energy is that it can renew itself naturally and does not disappear. Additionally, renewable energy types are critical in terms of reducing carbon emissions that harm the environment [87 ], not needing to be imported because they are domestic resources, and thus reducing foreign dependence on energy. Renewable energy sources are mainly grouped as “solar”, “wind”, “geothermal”, “hydraulic”, “biomass”, “wave” and “hydrogen” energies [88 ]. Thanks to the investments made in the field of renewable energy and technological advances, the consumption rates of renewable energy, which can be called “clean energy,” are increasing. The share of renewable energy in global final energy consumption is more than 20% in 2020 [89 ]. Additionally, the ratio of fossil fuels in total final energy consumption is high. Although renewable energy sources have such a wide potential, when looking at the energy types consumed worldwide, oil takes the first place, followed by coal and natural gas. In this context, managers should develop strategies to increase the use of renewable energy.  7 Comparative analysis In this section, comparative analysis is performed between the attained results from the proposed FF-SWARA method and another approach. To justify the results and show the efficiency of the proposed approach, the Bayesian Best Worst method [90 ] is utilized to determine the weight of indicators. The steps of Bayesian Best Worst method are summarized below [90 ].Step 1. The most (best) and the least (worst) important criteria are determined. The best and worst criteria are shown in Table 7  .    Step 2. The best criterion is compared with other criteria to construct Best-to-Others vector using the 1–9 scale. The higher number means the stronger importance. Vectors for all experts are presented in Table 8  .    Step 3. The worst criterion is compared with other criteria to construct Others-to-Worst vector using the 1–9 scale. The higher number means the stronger importance. Table 9   shows the Others-to-Worst vectors constructed by each expert.    Step 4. These two vectors are used as inputs in the model and computations are conducted from a probabilistic perspective in MATLAB code developed by Mohammedi and Razei [90 ]. Bayesian Best Worst has the same procedure as Best Worst method [91 ], but criteria weights are evaluated as probability distributions in the Bayesian version. Criteria weights for multiple experts are aggregated from a probability perspective. Matlab codes are customized for the highlighted problem and the weights of indicators are calculated as presented in Fig. 5  .    According to the results of comparative analysis, the same priority ranking is obtained for both the proposed FF-SWARA methodology and the Bayesian Best Worst method. From Fig. 5 , it is determined that the proposed approach is highly consistent with the existing weighting method. Table 10   presents the results of two methods.  8 Practical implications for Turkey According to the Sustainable Development Goals 2nd National Review Report for Turkey [92 ], developments regarding SDG-7 can be evaluated on the basis of four main themes: (i) Ensuring access to energy for all, (ii) increasing the share of renewable energy in total energy supply (iii) increasing energy efficiency and (iv) Developing of clean energy technologies and infrastructure. In the context of providing access to energy for everyone, liberalization efforts in the energy sector have gained importance since the beginning of the 2000s. For this purpose, most of the public power plants were privatized and new power plants were established by the private sector. Thus, the share of the private sector in the total installed power of electricity has increased significantly, and liberalization in electricity distribution and trade has increased. Providing uninterrupted energy requires optimization of supply, demand, transmission, distribution and storage systems. Turkey has made rapid progress especially in terms of access to electricity. Line and transformer investments continue for the expansion, renewal and modernization of the electricity transmission and distribution network to meet the increasing electricity demand and expand/improve the electricity transmission service. As technology and infrastructure facilities develop, the population with access to electricity is expected to increase in the coming periods. The rate of access to electricity in Turkey is at the level of 100%. Thus, Target 7.1 was reached for Turkey. Within the scope of increasing the share of renewable energy in the total energy supply; Turkey attaches great importance to energy production from renewable energy sources to diversify its energy resources, reduce dependency on imports, develop local manufacturing industry and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. With the effect of improved legislation and incentive mechanisms, there has been a significant increase in the share of renewable energy sources other than hydroelectricity, such as wind and solar. Turkey reached Target 7.2 in 2018. The share of renewable energy is increased to at least 30% by 2023 in Turkey. While hydroelectric has the largest share of renewable energy resources in Turkey, wind and solar power plants, which have become cheaper and more widespread recently with the development of energy technologies, are also in a rapid growth trend. The use of these resources should be encouraged and supported by the public. In line with Target 7.2, it is aimed to expand the use of renewable energy sources for electricity generation. In addition, steps to increase the share of renewable energy in the energy consumed in transportation, industry and residences within the framework of the Renewable Energy Action Plan will contribute to the increase in the share of renewable energy. Electricity is one of the most consumed energy types but its efficiency is questionable [93 ]. Various studies have been conducted in the fields of renewing processes/structures/systems, raising awareness on energy efficiency, providing energy efficiency consultancy services and improving energy management to increase energy efficiency in industry, public and service buildings in Turkey. For measuring the 7.3 target, the energy intensity indicator is based on primary energy and GDP. A decrease in energy intensity means that the amount of energy consumed to produce a unit of GDP is decreasing. A decrease in the energy density means that the energy efficiency increases. While the share of energy-intensive manufacturing industry sectors in GDP has decreased, the increase in the share of service sectors is one of the factors causing the decrease in energy intensity. In addition, although limited, it is seen that the transition from low and medium-low technology sectors with high energy consumption to medium-high technologies with lower energy consumption affects the decrease in energy intensity. It is considered that the activities conducted in the field of energy efficiency in the country, especially the improvement investments made in the industrial sector, the higher thermal insulation in the new buildings included in the stock, and the widespread use of high-efficiency electrical household appliances also affect this development. In the evaluation made on the basis of Target 7.3, notably the decrease in Turkey's energy intensity remains at a low level compared to the European Union (EU) and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) averages. However, Turkey's efforts to reduce its energy intensity need to be stepped up. Turkey brings together the Turkish energy industry with foreign technology by providing international energy cooperation. Thus, it is aimed to ensure the flow of information. These developments are important within the scope of Target 7.a. Within the scope of Target 7.b for less developed countries, the issue of developing infrastructure and technologies to provide modern and sustainable energy services to the entire population has been evaluated in the context of Turkey under Target 7.1. In the targets within the scope of SDG-7, especially in Target 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3, Turkey's installed power in electricity generation increased, renewable energy installed power increased, policies and legislation development toward energy efficiency was achieved and significant progress was made in the implemented projects between 2000 and 2016. However, Turkey's demographic, economic and social dynamics indicate that the increase in energy demand will continue.  9 Conclusion In this study, the indicator prioritizing problem to achieve SDG-7 was taken into account and modeled as an MCDM problem. For this purpose, each indicator was handled as a criterion and the importance of each indicator was determined to achieve SDG-7. An expert group has been formed which consists of three experts from both universities, and energy sector. Then, opinions from experts were taken about the importance of each indicator. Importance level of each indicator was determined by FF-SWARA and by this way prioritizing of indicators was performed. Results were discussed, and practical implications for Turkey were presented. The main contributions of this study to the application area and literature are fivefold as follows: (1) The indicators to achieve SDG-7, affordable and clean energy, have been modeled as MCDM problem; (2) The most important indicators of SDG-7 were determined under the fuzzy environment; (3) Practical implications for Turkey to achieve SDG-7 were explained with details; (4) To the best of authors knowledge, SWARA methodology has been extended under fermatean fuzzy environment for the first time; (5) Fermatean Fuzzy SWARA methodology has been proposed into the literature to solve group decision making problems. This study emphasizes that MCDM approach is a useful tool to prioritize indicators of SDGs. Indicators of SDG-7 were prioritized in this study, but other SDGs can be analyzed with the proposed approach. The proposed novel FF-SWARA was applied and the results were analyzed. The proposed fuzzy group decision-making methodology can be applied to different decision-making problems in part due to the numerous conflicting decision criteria present and the ability of MCDM methodologies to cope with the multidimensionality of the problem. The results showed that the most important indicator is accessibility to electricity. However, different MCDM approaches can yield different results when used to the same problem. As future studies, different MCDM approaches can be applied and evaluated to identify similarities and differences in the different methods and the obtained results, and consider their applicability in the handled problem. It is aimed that, the proposed group decision-making methodology can be utilized to prioritize indicators of different SDGs by different countries to develop strategies for achieving goals.
