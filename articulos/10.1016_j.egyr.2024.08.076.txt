                  Over the past decade, sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) research has surged due to aviation’s 2–3 % global emissions, driving urgent development to meet climate goals. This study employed a mixed-method approach, combining a literature review following the PRISMA framework with a case study analysis. This study is the first to systematically review the SAF literature through the lens of the SDGs, providing a comprehensive analysis of how SAF research contributes to various sustainable development targets. This highlights critical gaps in current research, particularly the need for studies focused on the economic and social dimensions of SAFs alongside technological and environmental aspects. This paper utilized BERTopic modeling for thematic analysis and the SDG Mapper tool to align SAF-related publications with SDGs, providing a comprehensive overview of the research landscape. The findings reveal that 38.9 % of SAF research aligns with SDG 13 (climate action), emphasizing the focus on mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) are also significantly represented, with 24.1 % and 13.7 % alignment, respectively. Six thematic topics are identified: net zero aviation emissions, SAF supply chain models, SAFs for advanced air mobility, microalgae-based aviation biofuels, bio jet fuel production processes, and renewable bio jet fuel catalysts. The case studies on SAFs cover technological innovations, supply chain management, environmental impact, and stakeholder engagement, highlighting the challenges and benefits of reducing the aviation industry's carbon footprint. To reduce aviation emissions, companies should optimize SAF blending, invest in Jatropha-based fuels, locate facilities strategically, retrofit refineries, assess life cycles, and engage stakeholders. Governments must update standards, provide financial incentives, support retrofits, ensure environmental standards, promote renewable feedstocks, foster collaboration, and incentivize SAF adoption. The results underscore SAF's potential to significantly contribute to multiple SDGs, particularly in reducing aviation's carbon footprint and promoting sustainable energy practices.

This is because the challenges faced by the aviation industry seem to be increasingly related to increasing carbon emissions from aircraft transportation fuel, which has an impact on environmental disturbances such as severe air pollution and atmospheric balance and ultimately threatens the long-term sustainability of the environment (Abrantes et al., 2021 ). The deployment of renewable jet fuels from biomass resources can have implications for sustainable development goals (SDGs), with potential trade-offs and synergies between climate change mitigation and other SDGs (Cavalett and Cherubini, 2018 ). However, a crucial gap exists in understanding how SAF research aligns with the broader goals for sustainable development outlined by the United Nations. The urgency of reducing carbon emissions in aviation cannot be denied (Marszalek and Lis, 2022 ). As an industry responsible for 2–3 % of global emissions (Becken and Mackey, 2017 ), airlines face enormous pressure to reduce CO2 (Yue and Byrne, 2024 ). This challenge is exacerbated by the projected share of the aviation sector, which will account for 25 % of carbon emissions by 2050 (IATA., 2023 ), highlighting the need for immediate action. To address the excessive particulate emissions and climate impacts associated with conventional aviation fuels, switching to environmentally friendly alternative fuels is essential (Märkl et al., 2024 ). Therefore, the SAF offers an important and very promising alternative solution – one that understands its relationship to UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Degirmenci et al., 2023 ). The ambitious target of reducing CO2 emissions by 50 % by 2050 needs to be realized immediately, which has been agreed upon in the Paris Agreement (Abrantes et al., 2021; Detsios et al., 2023; Mussatto et al., 2022 ). This effort is a strategic step in helping the aviation industry achieve the target of climate neutrality from renewable alternative fuels (Gil et al., 2022 ). Currently, the aviation industry has set sustainable goals to reduce fuel emissions. This attention has resulted in a number of studies on the design of frameworks for alternative fuels and their potential (Becken and Mackey, 2017; Dodd and Yengin, 2021; Hu et al., 2022 ), which have been assessed from the perspectives of technology, costs, emissions, policies and markets (Watson et al., 2024 ), and of course, the proposed decision-making framework for alternative fuel production routes through various effective environmental, economic, technical and social impacts (Ahmad et al., 2021 ). The rising threat of aviation fuel to the global climate has become a pressing sustainability concern, highlighting the importance of wider SAF production and utilization. However, evaluating the SAF presents challenges. The literature reviews often focus on specific aspects, such as climate impacts (Ahlström et al., 2023 ) or cost-effectiveness (Ng et al., 2021 ), and lack a comprehensive understanding of SAF's role in sustainable development. While valuable bibliometric studies on the SAF exist, such as Yamaguchi et al. (2023) , who examined environmental sustainability in aviation among many other topics identified industry and innovation and economic growth as key research areas. The study observed that cumulative publications over the years in the main SDG-related fields are environmental sciences, green technologies and energy fuels. This study breaks new ground by offering the first comprehensive analysis of the SAF literature through the lens of the UN SDGs. The study suggests that research on SDG is still evolving and leaves many SDGs unexplored, indicating that it is not yet a consolidated area of research. The importance of fulfilling the SAF achievement plan is very broad in all areas of the SDGs, especially for SDG 11, "Affordable and Clean Energy", which addresses climate change mitigation (Yue and Byrne, 2024 ). Additionally, it is beneficial for reducing energy requirements, lowering operational costs and minimizing environmental impacts, which is in line with SDG 12 "Responsible Consumption and Production" (García-Hernández et al., 2024 ). This concern was also conveyed by the challenges and limitations of SAF, which are related to environmentally friendly and cost-effective issues that are still being highlighted in its development (Usman et al., 2023 ). Therefore, there is a need to highlight and take serious decarbonization actions in line with the SDGs, which have promising opportunities to obtain beneficial long-term climate benefits, especially those related to SDGs 2, 3, 6, 11, 12, and 14 (Cavalett and Cherubini, 2018 ). Previous research on biofuels for aviation has identified both opportunities and concerns related to sustainability. For instance, Palmeros Parada et al. (2022)  highlighted issues related to energy security, investment risk, social development, and land use. Additionally, Batten et al. (2024)  explore policy options such as high taxes on conventional jet fuel to encourage airlines to adopt SAFs. These studies, along with others such as Cabrera and Melo de Sousa (2022) , who examined alternative fuel pathways, demonstrate the potential of SAF as a long-term solution. However, a key limitation exists. While Capaz et al. (2021)  investigated carbon mitigation potential and economic considerations and Karami et al. (2022)  explored the case of Carinata-based SAF, these studies often focused on specific aspects. Additionally, Carlson et al. (2023)  emphasize the need for further economic risk assessment. Leal Filho et al. (2023) , with a bibliometric approach, also explored carbon reduction strategies in the aviation sector and sustainability initiatives. Yuan et al. (2022)  used bibliometrics to identify priorities and trends in the development of bioenergy technologies to achieve sustainable development and carbon neutrality. Finally, the studies of Jiménez-Islas et al. (the reviews they discuss) contain issues that can be linked to SDGs, such as critical reviews of biomass and waste in the SAF (Aghamiri and Lahijani, 2024 ) and reviews of alternative aviation energy operators from the perspective of key challenges and implications (Ansell, 2023 ). Systematic investigations of the potential for SAF production from solid waste materials, such as food waste and cooking oil, as well as agricultural and forestry residues, have been performed (Emmanouilidou et al., 2023 ). Overview of SAF supply chain configurations from environmental and social challenges and benefit pathways (Martinez-Valencia et al., 2021 ). Previous studies have explored the potential of biofuels and SAF, as well as their economic and environmental aspects (Palmeros Parada et al., 2022 ; Capaz et al., 2021 ; Karami et al., 2022 ). All these studies point to a gap in the existing research – a comprehensive understanding of how SAFs explicitly align with the broader Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This research aims to fill this gap by conducting a systematic literature review that critically examines the role of the SAF in achieving the SDGs. By employing a bibliometric approach, this paper can not only assess the quantity and quality of existing research but also reveal key thematic trajectories and intellectual foundations within the field (Kalantari et al., 2017 ). Specifically, we ask the following research questions (RQs):• RQ1: How effectively does SAF research align with the SDGs?  • RQ2: What emerging topics in SAF research are likely to significantly shape the field's future?  • RQ3: How can insights from case studies inform the development of policies and strategies for advancing SAF practices?    This paper makes several key contributions to the literature. First, by employing a mixed-methods research design combining quantitative scientometric analysis with qualitative case studies, we explore SAF research contributions to SDGs. Second, our research is the first to map SAF research through the SDG framework using innovative machine learning algorithms for accurate mapping of the 17 SDGs. Third, we utilized BERTopic modeling to identify and map underexplored themes within the field. Finally, we examined case studies to demonstrate the connections between the SAF and the SDGs. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2  describes the methods used to gather and analyze the data. Section 3  presents our results based on the mixed-methods approach. Section 4  discusses areas for further study, including policy and practice implications. Section 5  concludes with a summary of our main findings and study limitations.  2 Methods This study explored the connection between the SAF and the SDGs. This paper employed a mixed-method approach, combining a literature review with a case study analysis ( Fig. 1 ). The first part involved a literature review following the PRISMA framework. This review identified relevant research on SAFs and used topic modeling to analyze thematic trends. This is followed by a review of 12 case studies that illustrate the various contexts within which the SAF is discussed. 2.1 PRISMA framework This paper adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Page et al., 2021 ) to ensure transparency and rigor. These guidelines are recognized for their effectiveness in bibliometric research across disciplines (Achuthan et al., 2023; Raman et al., 2023a ). Scopus, a comprehensive database of peer-reviewed literature, was chosen for its suitability for quantitative studies (Donthu et al., 2020 ). The search conducted on April 11, 2024, covered publications from 2015 onward, coinciding with the adoption of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In the identification phase, this paper used the following search terms from the titles and abstracts: "sustainable aviation fuel," "aviation biofuel," "aviation bio fuel," "biojet fuel," "bio jet fuel," "bio aviation fuel," and "low-carbon aviation fuel". The initial search yielded 1183 publications. Document types such as editorials, notes, errata, short surveys, and documents that did not have authors, abstracts, or English language, which were also included in the eligibility stage, were subsequently screened, and 1101 publications were selected for further analysis. These 1101 data points were also included based on their titles and abstracts that matched the appropriate literature.  2.2 BERTopic modeling While various topic modeling techniques exist, such as NMF, LDA, and To2Vec, research has shown BERTopic's potential to uncover new insights through its embedding approach (Egger and Yu, 2022 ). In this study, we utilized the BERTopic method for topic modeling, leveraging advanced techniques such as transformers and the Class-Tf-idf-Transformer to form concise topic clusters and generate coherent topics while retaining crucial terms (Grootendorst, 2022 ). The BERTopic technique was specifically applied to discern and scrutinize significant topics, offering in-depth insights into this domain. After data collection, the dataset underwent rigorous preprocessing, including text cleaning, natural language processing (NLP) strategies, and tokenization, to enhance quality and consistency. Further refinement for effective topic extraction and visualization was achieved using sentence embeddings produced with the "all-mpnet-base-v2" model from the Sentence Transformer and dimensionality reduction via uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) (McInnes et al., 2020). For the principal task of topic modeling, we used the "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" model from the Sentence Transformer. The BERTopic model was configured to include embeddings, representations, vectorization, and c-Tf-idf models, employing probability metrics for assigning topics to enhance interpretability and ensure robust and dependable findings. By fitting the BERTopic model to the preprocessed textual content, unique topics were identified along with their respective probabilities for each document. An examination of the topics' coherence and the distribution of articles among these topics provided insights into the articles' alignment with the identified topics (Raman et al., 2024b ). This elaborate and sophisticated approach to topic modeling underscores the reliability and thoroughness of our research findings. During BERTopic model training, we set the following key parameters: minimum topic size (min_topic_size = 20) and the number of extracted keywords per topic (top_n_words = 20). The min_topic_size determines the minimum number of publications assigned to a topic, with higher values leading to fewer, more specific topics. The top_n_words specifies the number of keywords used to represent each topic. Following training, we obtained a list of topics and their corresponding representative publications. Topic labels were generated based on keywords and the twenty most cited publications within each topic. For clear presentation and analysis, we focused on the five most recurring topics identified by BERTopic and analyzed the three most highly cited publications within each chosen topic.  2.3 SDG mapping To map the research to the UN SDGs, this paper employed the SDG Mapper tool from the European Commission's "Knowledge Base for the Sustainable Development Goals" (2021). This tool utilizes NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms to identify mentions of SDGs within the literature and to link publications to relevant SDGs. This process leverages a rule-based approach for identifying keywords or phrases associated with each SDG, ensuring efficient and accurate mapping (Raman et al., 2024a ). Bubble charts were generated to visualize SDG interconnections and their prominence within the analyzed publications. Several studies (Dzhunushalieva and Teuber., 2024; Raman et al., 2024 ) have used the SDG Mapper tool, demonstrating its reliability in mapping publications with specific SDGs. However, some errors may occur during the mapping process. In our limitations section, we have suggested using multiple SDG mapping initiatives for comparison to address potential inaccuracies.  2.4 Case study analysis Case studies are a valuable research method in various fields, allowing researchers to explore specific contexts through concrete examples. This approach is particularly well suited for sustainable development research, where it can be used independently or combined with other methods (Leal Filho et al., 2023 ). Therefore, this paper deliberately utilizes the term "case studies", as it presents real-world examples demonstrating the application of SAFs in various sustainability contexts. To complement the literature review and delve more deeply into specific contexts, we conducted a second literature search specifically for case studies. This paper selected 22 case studies based on their relevance to research questions, representativeness of the field, data availability, theoretical significance, and potential for comparison. From the identified case studies, 12 were chosen for thematic analysis. This analysis focused on identifying the key issues addressed, associated SDGs, participant types and numbers, and involved countries. By analyzing these topics, this paper was able to inductively derive insights into how SAFs can be employed in various contexts and contribute to different SDGs.   3 Results and discussion 3.1 Mapping SAF research to SDGs (RQ1) The SDG Mapper tool was utilized to align 1101 abstracts related to the SAF with specific SDGs and their targets.  Fig. 2  provides a visual representation of the alignment between SAF research and the SDGs, highlighting the most researched areas and their relevance to sustainable development. The size of each bubble corresponds to the proportion of associated keywords, calculated as the number of goal-specific keywords divided by the total keyword count. The large bubbles for SDG 13 and SDG 7 indicate a strong focus on climate action and clean energy, respectively, reflecting the critical need to reduce aviation emissions and integrate renewable energy sources in the industry. This trend is significant because it showcases the industry's commitment to addressing environmental challenges and underscores the importance of continued investment in these areas to achieve the SDGs. The data show that 38.9 % of SAF-related research aligns with SDG 13, which focuses on climate action. This underscores the significant emphasis on the potential of the SAF to mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from aviation. According to SDG 13, 24.1 % of the research aligns with SDG 7, emphasizing affordable and clean energy. This reflects SAF's role in promoting renewable energy sources within the aviation industry. Additionally, 13.7 % of the research is connected to SDG 12, responsible consumption and production, indicating a focus on sustainable production practices and waste reduction through the SAF. Moreover, 6.5 % of the publications are associated with SDG 15, which pertains to life on land, likely reflecting research into feedstock sustainability and land use for SAF production. Finally, 6.0 % of the research aligns with SDG 9, which focuses on industry, innovation, and infrastructure, highlighting the advancements and technological innovations in SAF development and the need for infrastructure adaptation to support SAF use. Of 169 possible SDG targets, 54 were identified as relevant through this process. SDG 13, which emphasizes climate action, is the most prominent, with 406 keywords, reflecting the significant focus on SAF's potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation. Within SDG 13, subtarget 13.2, which focuses on integrating climate change measures into national policies, strategies, and planning, is shown as a distinct bubble. This indicates focused research on how SAF can be integrated into climate policy frameworks to mitigate the aviation sector's carbon footprint. With respect to SDG 7, which focuses on affordable and clean energy, there are 252 keywords. Subtargets 7.2 and 7.3 are notably addressed in the context of SAF. Subtarget 7.2 aims to increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix, which aligns with SAF's role as a renewable energy source for aviation. Subtarget 7.3 aims to double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency. Research in this area has explored how SAFs can contribute to more energy-efficient aviation operations, thus reducing overall energy consumption. SDG 12, focused on responsible consumption and production, has 143 keywords. Subtarget 12.5, which focuses on substantially reducing waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling, and reuse, stands out in the context of the SAF. Research in this area looks at how SAF can be produced from waste materials, such as agricultural residues and municipal solid waste, thus contributing to waste reduction and promoting sustainable production practices. SDG 9, which pertains to industry, innovation, and infrastructure, also features prominently in SAF research. Subtargets 9.4 and 9.5 are highlighted. Subtarget 9.4 focuses on upgrading infrastructure and retrofitting industries to make them sustainable. This is relevant to SAF research that explores the retrofitting of existing aviation infrastructure to accommodate SAF use. Subtarget 9.5 aims to enhance scientific research and upgrade technological capabilities, reflecting the ongoing advancements in SAF technology and production methods to improve efficiency and scalability.  3.2 Thematic topics based on BERTopic modeling (RQ2) 3.2.1 Net zero aviation emissions The adoption of the ambitious goal of net zero aviation carbon emissions by 2050 has resulted in the implementation of a range of sustainable measures by both governments and private sector organizations. The studies grouped under this topic contribute to SDG13 by helping to identify the challenges in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions by the aviation sector by further providing recommendations both at the global level and country level to help move closer to the goal of net zero emissions. These studies also contribute to the progression of clean energy technology, thus contributing directly to SDG7. Hasan et al. (2021)  studied the global-level factors contributing to increasing trends in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by the aviation sector, including emissions from aircraft and increasing conventional fuel demand. They also further analyze the national and regional policies that are implemented by countries such as the US, Australia, and Europe to help mitigate GHG emissions and the achievements of these measures. This study also proposes pathways that would help achieve the goal of net zero emissions through the use of alternate sustainable fuels such as fourth-generation biofuels, hydrogen-fueled engines, and solar-powered aircraft. Other suggested measures include improved fuel-efficiency measures, the initiation and successful implementation of market-based policies by countries, shifting transportation demand to other modes with fewer emissions, such as marine transportation, fleet modernization with improved airframes, and efficient engine technology. Mitigation pathways are proposed based on possibilities identified from the past literature. Studying US policy for achieving the net zero emission goal, Jensen et al. (2023)  propose a comparative parametric framework that compares various (high, medium, and low) emission scenarios. The study suggested the introduction of new-age advanced aircraft technology, innovative operational improvements, uninterrupted supply, and the use of sustainable alternate fuels along with the implementation of market-based measures that would help the US meet its goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Yang et al. (2023)  suggested similar measures for the Chinese aviation industry and reported that the use of alternate sustainable fuels is one of the best methods for reducing carbon emissions. Furthermore, this study highlights the importance of developing new-generation aircraft with upgraded technology and facilitating the carbon trading market for China's civil aviation industry.  3.2.2 Supply chain models for SAF The supply chain model for aviation fuel includes feedstock harvesting farms, preprocessing, and storage facilities for biomass before transporting it to biorefineries, where it is converted to refined fuel. The refined fuel is then transported to distribution centers to be distributed to consumers. The uncertainties of land availability for feedstock, continuous yield availability, competitive conversion of biomass to aviation fuel, high capital costs, and technological risks make jet biofuels less competitive today than jet fossil fuel. The development of country-specific efficient, cost-effective supply chain models has been the focus of several studies that are clustered under this topic, contributing to SDG 7 by advancing technology to promote clean energy in the aviation sector (target 7. a). To explore this further, three studies relating to Brazil, Ohio, Georgia, and the US are discussed. In an attempt to identify potential location-specific optimal pathways for Brazil, Cervi et al. (2020)  assessed spatiotemporal production routes and related costs, including the technoeconomic potential of jet biofuel production routes. The study revealed that the Northeast and Southeast Regions of Brazil, which have several viable production routes, have the highest potential. Focusing on Ohio, US, and applying a geographic information system (GIS)-based model, Mousavi-Avval et al. (2023)  estimated the best locations for establishing pennycress production potential. Using six years of historical data, 12 biorefineries were identified as having high potential to minimize risks related to feedstock supply and cost variability for sustainable aviation fuel production. Using an 'integrated mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model' combined with GIS analysis, Ullah et al. (2023)  designed a spatially explicit supply chain configuration to minimize transportation costs for the location of Carinata-based aviation biofuel production in Georgia, US. Along with building the supply chain, this study also evaluates greenhouse gas emissions to determine the carbon abatement cost necessary to support sustainable jet biofuel over conventional fossil fuel-based aviation fuels.  3.2.3 SAF for advanced air mobility Research in the last decade has progressed in developing sustainable, carbon-neutral aviation jet fuels that help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute directly to SDG7 goals by advancing clean energy technology and research. The conventional jet fuels for turbojets, turbofan, and dual-mode ramjet engines based on kerosene-grade fuels and crude oil-based fuels are being replaced by alternate fuels. According to the International Civil Aviation Organization, as of 2023, there are eleven ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials Standards) approved production paths for alternate jet fuels.1  1 Accessed from Conversion processes (ICAO.int) as of 4.05.24   Eleven more are under review. Adding evidence to these reviews are studies grouped under this topic that attempt to validate the various aspects of alternate jet fuels using numerical simulation methods. Using numerical simulation models, Åkerblom et al. (2023)  compared the effects of conventional jet fuels A1 and A and their alternate sustainable aviation fuels C1 and C5 on laminar burning velocities, ignition delay times, and spray combustion in aeroengines. They found that alternate sustainable jet fuels performed relatively better than conventional fuels. The development of novel modeling techniques that help validate new alternate fuel aspects requires accurate and comprehensive data from experimental methods. Harper et al. (2022)  studied experiments using nine aviation fuels, including conventional jet fuels and sustainable alternate jet fuels, and blended them to create a database of nvPM and gaseous emissions over a range of combustor operating conditions and pressures. The experiment was performed at the Cardiff University Gas Turbine Research Centre (GTRC) RQL combustor with support from the H2020 JETSCREEN (JET fuel SCREENing and optimization platform for alternative fuels) project. This study used the European (EUR) nvPM reference system to obtain ICAO regulatory-compliant nvPM and gaseous emissions data. These databases are important for future research on alternate jet fuels. While the above studies focused on jet fuels, research on advanced air mobility (AMM) as an alternative to current transportation solutions in traffic-congested urban areas and in remote or difficult-to-serve areas is gaining momentum. The use of hybrid electric power trains with internal combustion engines (ICEs) for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating on sustainable aviation fuels is currently of interest. Sapra et al. (2024)  contributed to this area by developing a novel ignition strategy leading to fuel efficiency and fuel-agnostic ignition capabilities for ICE employed in the AMM sector. This study optimized energy-assisted compression ignition (EACI) technology for high-altitude operations using a combined computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and machine learning (ML)-based piston-bowl optimization methodology.  3.2.4 Microalgae-based aviation biofuels The market size of biofuel for aviation is forecasted to increase by a CAGR of 12.7 % between 2023 and 2031.2  2 Accessed from https://straitsresearch.com/report/aviation-biofuels-market  as on 17.04.2024   Among the 3rd-generation biofuels currently being explored for their minimal environmental impact and cost-effective solutions to help combat climate change and its impact (SDG13), microalgal biomass is considered the most promising biofuel feedstock. Given that the current research on algae biofuels is still in the early stages, with the production cost of algae biodiesel (approx. $2/L) being nearly twice that of Petro diesel (approx. $0.9/L), research studies have focused on technical advancements in the mass cultivation of algae biomass (Moon et al., 2022 ), processing technologies and operating conditions in the production of biofuels, including biojet fuels (Khan et al., 2023 ). Three related studies on this topic that contribute to SDG7 by promoting investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology are discussed here. The study by Moon et al. (2022)  focused on reviewing the oleaginous algal biomass obtained from industrial wastes and their mass cultivation; they also included in their review the production of renewable biodiesel and biojet fuel using algal lipids via catalytic upgrading and the diversification of bioproducts generated from residual lipid-extracted biomass. This study identified the possible use of algae-neutral lipids through catalytic upgrades that can be used as feedstocks for drop-in biofuels (such as biojet fuel), as these fuels are seen to have high energy density, compatibility with existing infrastructure, and reduced CO2 emissions. Although extensive research has been conducted in this area over the last two decades, the research is limited by poor cost competitiveness in the production process of biodiesel. A review by Khan et al. (2023)  focused on the comparative analysis of seven microalgal biofuels in terms of processing technology and operating conditions. They also compared the net energy ratios, carbon emissions, and cost of production across these biofuels to conclude that there is a need for further technological development in the cultivation of microalgae biomass, newer techniques to help improve the net energy ratio of biojet fuels, cost-competitive production and improved cultivation for possibilities of collection of more accurate data for techno-economic studies. While the above studies reviewed the current literature related to biofuels, Baldisserotto et al. (2021)  attempted to study whether mixotrophic cultivation of Thalassiosira pseudonana could stimulate growth and lipid accumulation. This study revealed more results for mixotrophic cultivation than for autotrophic cultivation, where T. pseudoana supplied with pure or crude glycerol resulted not only in greater lipid accumulation (double) but also an increase in relatively short-chain fatty acids potentially useful for biojet fuels. This study revealed the economic advantages of mixotrophic cultivation. As indicated earlier, while research in this area is growing, there is potential for more research related to finding an accepted cost-effective, zero-polluting biojet fuel.  3.2.5 Bio jet fuel production processes The current high demand for air transportation is a cause for concern, as emissions continue to increase due to increasing demand. Although progress has been made in the development of several pathways to produce biodiesel in recent years, these processes are still energy intensive, thus increasing the energy demand (Tiwari et al., 2023 ). Through experimentation, researchers are trying to reduce this increasing energy demand in the production process of sustainable aviation fuel, thus making a direct contribution to SDG13 of combating climate change. Some of the early studies on this topic related to process improvement and energy integration that contribute to SDG7 upgrading technology for supplying sustainable aviation fuel are grouped under this topic. The feasibility of reducing the total energy requirement for hydrotreatment and supercritical processes was studied by Villegas-Herrera et al. (2018) . With energy integration of the two processes of supercritical and hydrotreating to produce biojet fuel, this study found that this not only reduces the external energy demand but also further results in energy savings. The design and simulation of both processes are performed, realizing a sensitivity analysis of the process equipment along with a pinch analysis to identify the potential of process integration. Gutiérrez-Antonio et al. (2016)  proposed energy integration for the hydrotreating process using renewable raw material (Jatropha curcas). The results of the study indicate that using an energy integration process in the production of biojet fuel from renewable raw materials can not only reduce the energy demand of biojet fuel production but also increase the cost of biojet fuel production compared to that of conventional jet fuel production. Similarly, Romero-Izquierdo et al. (2017) , using Jatropha curcas as a renewable raw material for biofuel production, proposed a novel model and optimized the separation zones of the hydrotreating process by comparing four distillation schemes, including two conventional and two intensified options. The results highlight some of the processes that show good results for energy integration, indicating lower energy consumption, thus making biofuel production competitive with conventional jet fuel production.  3.2.6 Renewable bio jet fuel catalysts One of the most promising alternative jet fuels is those sourced from biomass feedstock. The efficient conversion of various biomass-derived compounds into jet fuels along with other value-added chemicals could be an economically viable option for alternative fuels. Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of biomass waste includes catalytic processes that are critical for the generation of sustainable aviation biofuel. Researchers have experimented with several classes of catalysts to increase the efficiency of jet fuel production (Cakan et al., 2023). We further explore this issue with three selected papers on this topic that contribute to facilitating the enhancement of technology to help increase access to efficient clean energy, as prescribed under SDG7. Recent studies, such as that of Razak et al. (2024) , in which Ni and Co were loaded on a catalyst for waste cooking oil, revealed the superior performance of the catalyst and its deoxygenation activity, with 80 % yield and 92 % biojet selectivity. Kaewtrakulchai et al. (2022)  used a metal phosphate catalyst with palm olein oil as a catalyst support to support the Fe-P/PFC catalyst with the highest hydrocracking performance based on 100 % conversion with 94.6 % biojet selectivity. Zitouni et al. (2021) , on the other hand, experimented with difurfurylidene acetone produced by aldol condensation as a renewable feedstock for the production of sustainable aviation fuel. This study used one-step catalytic HDO conversion with a Ni-supported SiO2-ZrO2 catalyst and achieved 100 % FAF conversion and 65 % selectivity toward C13-C16 hydrocarbons, thus promoting an economically viable one-step process to produce biojet fuel. The studied catalysts—Ni and Co loaded, metal phosphate, and difurfurylidene acetone—each have strengths and weaknesses in making biojet fuel. Ni- and Coloaded catalysts work well with waste cooking oil, achieving high yields and selectivity but require precise conditions to remain effective. Metal phosphate catalysts, such as Fe-P/PFC with palm oil, convert materials efficiently and are robust, although they can be costly. Difurfurylidene acetone, used with a Ni-supported catalyst, also shows good conversion and selectivity, offering an economical one-step process, but more research is needed for large-scale use. These catalysts are crucial for making renewable jet fuel more viable and scalable despite some challenges.  Sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) offer a powerful solution for the environmental footprint of the aviation industry. Technological advancements and optimized production pathways for SAFs hold immense value in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality, directly aligning with SDG 13: Climate Action and SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being. To maximize the potential of SAFs, efficient supply chain management is crucial. This requires meticulous planning that prioritizes SDG issues. Identifying optimal feedstock types and locations aligns with SDG 12's focus on sustainable production and consumption. Additionally, adapting risk assessments to address a changing climate aligns with SDG 13's call for urgent action. Furthermore, minimizing transportation costs and utilizing existing infrastructure, as advocated by SDG 9, can promote resilient infrastructure development and foster innovation. By strategically aligning SAF development with the SDGs, the future of sustainable aviation that benefits the environment, human health, and economic development can be unlocked. While SAFs offer significant environmental benefits, challenges remain. Issues such as algae production, battery technology integration, and biorefinery reliance require scrutiny to ensure minimal environmental impact. Furthermore, limited financial and technological resources can hinder innovation. These concerns highlight the importance of SDG 13, climate action, which emphasizes clean environments and combating climate change. In addition to climate change, SDGs 14 and 15 urge sustainable land and water use practices, which are critical considerations for SAF production. To address these challenges and enable sustainable growth, collaboration between governments and industry is essential. This partnership should focus on building dynamic partnerships for SAF development, as envisioned by SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals. Additionally, a flexible and cost-effective supply chain aligns with SDG 12: responsible consumption and production. Efficient governance and innovative methods will unlock the full potential of SAF production, enhancing the industry's competitive advantage and contributing to its long-term success.   3.3 Case studies (RQ3) The adoption of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) is essential for reducing the carbon footprint of the aviation industry. Several case studies provide insights into the implementation, challenges, and benefits of SAFs, as explained below. 3.3.1 Technological innovations and production pathways The development and implementation of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) are crucial for reducing the carbon footprint of the aviation industry. Various case studies highlight technological innovations and production pathways, providing insights into the effectiveness and efficiency of different methods. In Canada, a study focused on the front-end design decisions for producing SAFs via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, targeting waste-to-liquid production at Toronto Pearson Airport. The findings indicate that a spoke-and-hub approach is twice as efficient as centralized processing, with gas cleaning needs aligning with coal gasification, and HTL oil requires less feed than pyrolysis oil (Montoya Sánchez et al., 2022 ). Another study from Canada showed that fully formulated synthetic jet fuel can be produced via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, meeting Jet A-1 specifications but requiring regulatory updates for commercial use. Different refining pathways indicate the potential for producing comparable kerosenes. These findings highlight the need for regulatory updates, technological development, and industry collaboration for sustainable aviation fuels (de Klerk et al., 2024 ). A German case study on hybrid-electric aircraft designs using an enhanced SUAVE version focused on battery technology and hybridization levels. The study revealed that NOx emissions can be improved by 83 % compared to those of ATR 42 and highlighted the need for optimized energy management strategies to achieve significant reductions in climate impact (Eisenhut et al., 2023 ).  3.3.2 Supply chain management and strategic planning Efficient supply chain management and strategic planning are vital for the successful implementation of SAFs. Several case studies illustrate the importance of these elements. In Queensland, Australia, an assessment of the lignocellulosic biomass supply for aviation biofuel production outlined a 25-year scale-up strategy. The study revealed that a mixed feedstock base maximizes the sustainable biomass supply and that regrowth biomass offers lower costs due to low establishment and maintenance (Murphy et al., 2015 ). In Brazil, resilience analytics for aviation biofuel supply chains highlighted the importance of updating problem frames to improve risk assessment objectivity. This study emphasized the need for resilience analytics to address evolving stakeholder preferences under technological, economic, and regulatory stressors (Connelly et al., 2016 ). A study from India on optimizing the supply chain for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in India highlights the potential to produce 11 million tons of SAF annually through pathways such as HEFA, AtJ, and Fischer–Tropsch. This approach emphasizes strategically locating facilities to minimize transportation costs and suggests retrofitting existing refineries in southern India as the most feasible option for SAF production (Ravi et al., 2023 ).  3.3.3 Environmental impact and sustainability Assessing the environmental impact and sustainability of SAFs is crucial for ensuring their long-term viability. Various case studies provide insights into these aspects. A life cycle assessment of algae-derived diesel, jet fuel, and gasoline via hydrothermal liquefaction identified factors impacting regulatory compliance for algae biofuels under RFS2. A study in the USA revealed that algae biofuels can reduce lifecycle GHG emissions by more than 50 % compared to petroleum fuels, with compliance depending on upstream CO2 sources and non-CO2 atmospheric emissions (Connelly et al., 2015 ). A case study at Darwin International Airport, Australia, revealed that stakeholders' views on sustainable aviation fuel offer a long-term, eco-friendly solution, while battery technologies require improvements in energy density, weight, and recycling efficiency to be competitive (Bardell and Ashton, 2018 ). This study highlighted challenges related to supply chain impact, distribution models, and end-user positioning. In Mexico, an optimization approach for the aviation biofuel supply chain incorporating hydrogen production resulted in significant reductions in production costs and CO2 emissions when using renewable raw materials (Domínguez-García et al., 2017 ). This study highlighted the benefits of integrating fossil fuel infrastructures with biorefineries to optimize the supply chain. The aviation industry in Africa faces several challenges, such as the high cost of new, fuel-efficient aircraft, limited infrastructure, and the absence of supportive financial resources and technology for adopting clean technology and achieving significant emissions reductions (Dube and Nhamo, 2019 ).  3.3.4 Stakeholder engagement and policy support Stakeholder engagement and policy support are critical for the successful deployment of SAFs. Several case studies highlight the importance of these factors. A longitudinal examination of a 10-year partnership in the Netherlands between KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and WWF Netherlands for promoting aviation biofuels highlighted the importance of dynamic capabilities such as learning, coordination, and reconfiguration (Mousavi and Bossink, 2020 ). Microfoundations such as strategic partner sensing and institutional dialog were found to be crucial. In Brazil, a study found that comprehensively addressing social sustainability issues in the biojet fuel supply chain is crucial, emphasizing the need for better measurement methods for human health and safety and social development and for adapting governance structures to specific contexts (Kamali et al., 2018 ). A study in the southeastern USA revealed that rotary shear milling and pyrolysis conversion of forest residues can produce 650 million gallons of SAF at a breakeven cost of $5.51 per gallon, demonstrating significant economic efficiency (Li et al., 2024 ). These case studies ( Fig. 3 ) illustrate the multifaceted approach to implementing SAFs involving technological innovation, strategic planning, stakeholder engagement, economic incentives, international cooperation, and comprehensive sustainability assessments.    4 Implications 4.1 Implications for practice The adoption of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) is crucial for reducing the aviation industry's carbon emissions. Aviation companies should use optimization models to determine the best blending ratios of SAFs and conventional kerosene to reduce costs and meet emission targets. Jatropha-based jet fuel is a cost-effective option for blending. Investment in the research and development of new SAF production methods, such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, is necessary. These methods require regulatory support and industry collaboration to become commercially viable. Strategically locating biomass procurement points, preprocessing units, and SAF production facilities can minimize transportation costs and ensure a steady fuel supply. Retrofitting existing refineries and integrating them with biorefineries can further optimize the SAF supply chain. Conducting life cycle assessments of SAFs can help identify and mitigate potential environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas emissions and land use. The aviation industry should prioritize renewable feedstocks, such as algae and agricultural residues, for sustainable production and waste reduction. Engaging with stakeholders, such as fuel wholesalers and regulatory bodies, is critical for gaining support for SAF initiatives. Public awareness campaigns can also enhance consumer support for sustainable aviation. Aviation companies can balance cost and emissions when blending SAF with conventional kerosene using several optimization models. Linear programming (LP) models optimize blending ratios to minimize costs while meeting emissions targets. Multiobjective optimization models use techniques such as Pareto efficiency to balance multiple goals, while stochastic programming models account for uncertainties in fuel prices and regulations, providing adaptable strategies. Implementing these models involves collecting accurate data on fuel costs, emissions factors, availability, and regulations, integrating these data, and refining the models through scenario analysis and sensitivity testing to ensure real-world accuracy. Challenges include ensuring data quality and availability, navigating complex regulations, and balancing costs and emissions. Solutions involve investing in better data management, remaining updated with regulatory changes, seeking financial support from governments, and integrating models with existing IT systems. Training staff to use these models effectively is also crucial. By addressing these challenges, aviation companies can promote SAF use while maintaining economic viability.  4.2 Implications for policy Governments must facilitate the adoption of SAFs by updating and harmonizing international standards to ensure that synthetic jet fuels meet safety and performance specifications (Cabrera and Melo de Sousa, 2022 ). Financial incentives for research and development in SAF production technologies, such as subsidies or tax credits, can accelerate technological advancements. Governments should provide financial and technical support for retrofitting refineries and developing new SAF production facilities through grants, low-interest loans, and public private partnerships. The development of diverse and resilient supply chain models can address uncertainties in feedstock availability and supply chain disruptions. Environmental standards must be strict to ensure that SAF production processes are sustainable and do not harm ecosystems. Policies should promote renewable feedstocks and incentivize practices that reduce waste and improve sustainability. Collaborative frameworks that bring together industry stakeholders can facilitate the transition to SAFs. Financial incentives for airlines and airports, such as tax breaks and grants for infrastructure upgrades, are necessary for widespread SAF adoption. Various organizational initiatives, government incentives, and effective policies are required to promote the widespread use of SAFs by the aviation sector (Shahriar and Khanal, 2022 ).   5 Conclusion Adopting SAFs is essential for reducing the aviation industry's carbon footprint by contributing to the SDGs. This research innovatively addresses critical topics for achieving net-zero aviation emissions. These topics include developing a sustainable aviation fuel supply chain, understanding the impact of such fuels, and exploring promising options such as microalgae-based biofuels, biojet fuel production processes, and renewable catalysts. Regulatory hurdles, such as the need for updates and harmonization across different regions, pose challenges to the commercial adoption of SAFs. Implementing strategic practices and supportive policies can overcome the technological, economic, and logistical challenges of SAF production and distribution. Integrating SAFs into existing infrastructure, conducting lifecycle assessments, and engaging stakeholders can help the aviation industry achieve the SDGs. To boost the production of renewable aviation fuel, several key challenges must be addressed. One of the foremost obstacles is the high cost associated with SAF production, which often makes it less competitive compared to conventional jet fuels. Technological limitations, including the scalability of production processes and the availability of sustainable feedstocks, further complicate efforts to expand SAF use. Regulatory hurdles also play a significant role, as the lack of harmonized global standards for SAF production and use creates barriers to widespread adoption. Additionally, there is a need for substantial investment in infrastructure, particularly in retrofitting existing refineries and developing new facilities capable of producing SAF at scale. Overcoming these challenges requires coordinated efforts between governments, industry stakeholders, and the scientific community, including the development of integrated policy frameworks that provide financial incentives, support research and development, and promote international collaboration. Addressing these issues is critical to advancing the production and adoption of SAFs, thereby contributing significantly to global climate goals and the sustainable development agenda. Future research should focus on developing and optimizing new SAF production technologies to reduce costs and improve scalability. Creating integrated policy frameworks that address the entire SAF supply chain, from feedstock production to final fuel use, is also essential. While environmental benefits are recognized, there is a need for more research on the social sustainability of biojet fuel, including gender and social equity, food security, health and safety, and community engagement (Sharno and Hiloidhari, 2024 ). Various alternative energy carriers, including biojet fuels, power-to-liquid synthetic kerosene, and liquid hydrogen, are being considered (Cabrera and Melo de Sousa, 2022 ). However, there are significant technoeconomic considerations that must be addressed before implementation. The development of standardized metrics for assessing the sustainability of different SAF pathways will provide clearer guidelines for industry and policymakers. Ongoing technological challenges in SAF production, including high costs and technical feasibility issues, require further research and development. Future research should also investigate the integration of SAFs with emerging technologies such as electric and hybrid propulsion systems. Studies should also explore the potential of regional biomass resources to create localized SAF production hubs, enhancing supply chain resilience and sustainability. Along these lines, when exploring global collaboration frameworks to standardize SAF production and distribution, aligning with SDG 17 is important. Additionally, research should assess the global economic impacts of widespread SAF adoption to ensure equitable access and benefits, supporting SDG 8. Research should also evaluate the long-term environmental impacts of large-scale SAF deployment across different ecosystems worldwide, contributing to SDGs 15 and 14. Future studies should focus on the social impacts of SAF production, including gender equity, food security, and community health. Addressing technoeconomic challenges involves innovating feedstock processing, reducing costs, and developing scalable methods. Collaborations between academia, industry, and government are crucial for real-world testing. Integrated policy frameworks, including clear standards and financial incentives, are needed to support SAF adoption. Governments should promote investment in SAF infrastructure and foster PPPs. Effective implementation requires coordination among stakeholders and transparent monitoring to ensure compliance and progress. Our study has certain limitations. Within the PRISMA framework, potential biases may arise from selecting literature from a specific database. We acknowledge the strength of BERT topic modeling in handling large datasets and uncovering key themes. By extracting coherent topic representations based on semantic similarity, topic modeling reduces human biases in topic classification, thereby enhancing the objectivity and reliability of the findings (Kimura, 2024 ). However, the effectiveness of topic modeling algorithms depends on the quality of the input data and the assumptions embedded in their design. Additionally, mapping publications to SDGs is complex, and our analysis recognizes the limitations of using a specific SDG mapping approach (Raman et al., 2023b ). Future research should compare our findings with results from multiple SDG mapping initiatives, such as Aurora Network's SDG Queries and the University of Auckland's SDG mapping. Such comparisons could provide a broader perspective and enhance the robustness of future studies, although this is beyond the scope of the current review.
