                  This study presents a comprehensive analytical framework for evaluating the similarity between organizations’ specific strategic directions and the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The proposed framework uses a multi-attribute decision-making method (MADM) in which organizations are evaluated concerning the SDGs. In particular, we use the Integrated Criteria Importance through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) and Evaluation based on the Distance from Average Solution Method (EDAS) because of their computational efficiency. Based on a pre-defined algorithm, we find decision matrices that contain relatedness scores between each organization’s mission statements and the SDGs. This framework evaluates 244 top 300 Philippine higher education institutions (HEIs). The findings reveal that HEIs’ mission statements are related to SDGs concerning climate action, reduced inequalities, and life on land; meanwhile, there were limited mission statements relating to industry, innovation, and infrastructure. The evaluation is used to rank the HEIs. This study can be considered a benchmark for future related studies and an effective tool to help design mission statements that effectively convey organizations’ commitment to SDGs.

This study presents a comprehensive analytical framework for evaluating the similarity between organizations’ specific strategic directions and the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The proposed framework uses a multi-attribute decision-making method (MADM) in which organizations are evaluated concerning the SDGs. In particular, we use the Integrated Criteria Importance through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) and Evaluation based on the Distance from Average Solution Method (EDAS) because of their computational efficiency. Based on a pre-defined algorithm, we find decision matrices that contain relatedness scores between each organization’s mission statements and the SDGs. This framework evaluates 244 top 300 Philippine higher education institutions (HEIs). The findings reveal that HEIs’ mission statements are related to SDGs concerning climate action, reduced inequalities, and life on land; meanwhile, there were limited mission statements relating to industry, innovation, and infrastructure. The evaluation is used to rank the HEIs. This study can be considered a benchmark for future related studies and an effective tool to help design mission statements that effectively convey organizations’ commitment to SDGs.

The agenda comprised 17 SDGs, with 169 sub-targets. These goals reflect sustainable development’s economic, social, and environmental pillars. Moreover, several scholars advocate that SDGs must be implemented in an integrated fashion rather than a segmented knowledge and regulatory framework [1] . Since its publication, integrative reports have been made available to monitor the progress and to link the targets to manageable information granules that were palatable to global organizations. Hák et al. [2]  proposed a set of indicators to monitor the progress of SDGs at various reporting levels. Allen et al. [3]  reviewed feasible models or pathways for national governments to implement the SDGs. Georgeson and Maslin [4]  also examined certain approaches to integrating the SDGs into actual practice. Due to the complexities of achieving the SDGs, Caiado et al. [5]  outlined some potentials and constraints, and Salvia et al. [6]  examined how the academic community could address some pressing concerns. The countries’ initial progress was first reported by Allen et al. [7] , followed by a more recent progress report published by Halkos and Gkampoura [8] . These revealed significant achievements in some SDGs (e.g., SDG8, SDG9, and SDG12) and emphasized the necessary efforts to leapfrog in the areas of education (SDG 4), sustainable cities and communities (SDG11), and climate change (SDG13). Indubitably, achieving these SDGs by 2030 will be challenging; however, successfully achieving them would significantly improve the sustainability of life on the planet [9] . The commitment of organizations to SDGs is consistently highlighted in practice (e.g., [10] ) and scholarly literature (e.g., [11] ). Companies integrate SDGs to strengthen their social legitimacy and reputation [12,13] . Different markets and sectors are expected to have diverse perceptions in addressing and implementing SDGs. From a marketing industry perspective, they are concerned about SDGs primarily as a means to improve employment opportunities by establishing sustainable, innovative, and people-oriented economies [14] . In the industrial sector, SDGs related to production and technological modernization are more popular (e.g., the inclusion of young people in the labor market, enhancement of resource efficiency, and mitigation of environmental degradation; [15] ). Meanwhile, the chemical industry focuses on the adverse effects of its operational activities on the environment (e.g., pollutants or operational exhaust generated; [16] ). The SDGs champion opportunities for environmental protection. That is, they affect the process implemented by various industries by emphasizing the urgent need to adjust consumption and production patterns and adhering to the “call to battle” against climate change and other global concerns. When SDGs are integrated into organizational processes, a careful evaluation of sustainability is warranted. This provides a more precise direction, sharper focus, and improved understanding. Moreover, strategic management is pivotal to the success of the SDGs [17] . According to Zeemering [18] , strategic planning allows decision-makers to critically consider how sustainability and sustainable development concepts upend preconceived notions regarding their strategy, priorities, and service delivery models with respect to social, economic, and environmental benefits. The process of fostering sustainability actions and decisions at all organizational levels begins with the establishment of strategic management processes [19] . To develop efficient strategic directions, a mission statement is a powerful tool [20] . Numerous studies have demonstrated the necessity of a well-articulated mission statement that communicates essential information regarding organizational goals to obtain favorable outcomes [19,21,22] . Beyond industrial settings, higher education institutions (HEIs) also integrate SDGs into their strategic directions. In support of the SDGs, the Copernicus Agreement was signed by almost 300 HEIs in Europe, and together with the Higher Education Sustainability Initiative, the commitment of HEIs to global objectives has been strengthened [23] . HEIs are essential actors in fostering lifelong learning and are key agents in the education of future leaders; thus, they are expected to contribute to the successful realization and implementation of SDGs [24] . As each HEI has a unique goal, they carefully adopted certain aspects of other institutions’ optimal practices. According to the Global University Network for Innovation [25] , there were missed opportunities and advances in the education sector. Consequently, the UN high-level political forum encourages HEIs to release an annual report on how they encapsulate SDGs [26] . The report details how they address and teach leaders to incorporate SDGs into their practices, policies, and curricula. However, they are not adequately coordinated to promote social or environmental sustainability or strategically supported by the institution’s encompassing strategy [27] . Although they actively pursue certain SDGs by leveraging opportunities for teaching, research, and collaboration with society and other external partners, some objectives require greater action, which results in some institutions falling behind [26] . As a solution, they can better evaluate the alignment of the overall organizational strategy and the SDGs embedded in identity instruments, such as the mission statement. Aligning organizations’ strategic direction with the SDGs ensures coherence at various organizational levels. Such coherence promotes efficiency in organizational planning, resource allocation, and strategy development. Recent advances have been made in integrating sustainability within HEIs, following a range of aspects, including learning processes [28] , synergistic initiatives across layers of functions [29] , transdisciplinary approaches in curriculum design [30] , funding requirements [31] , and an expanded set of aspects examined in the domain literature. Despite these current initiatives in embedding the sustainability agenda in higher education, holistically exploring how organizational direction is aligned with SDGs remains an area that must be addressed. Thus, this study bridges that gap by explicitly evaluating the mission statements of HEIs in terms of how they fit with the 17 SDGs. Such an agenda informs HEIs in crafting an improved strategic direction that conforms with the requirements of the SDGs. The proposed evaluation is a multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) method. The 17 SDGs are considered the attributes, and the HEIs are the alternatives in a goal-attribute-alternative hierarchy, which is commonly represented in most MADM methods. Several reports have been published on the development and progress of MADM methods and hybrids [32–34] , with a particular focus on sustainability issues [35] . The strengths and weaknesses of each method have been widely studied, and comparative analyses of various methods are presented in most cases. In view of the proposed topic to be addressed by the MADM method, the integration of CRiteria importance through inter-criteria correlation (CRITIC) and Evaluation Based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) methods are adopted. CRITIC assigns priority weights of attributes (i.e., SDGs); EDAS evaluates the mission statements of HEIs. Proposed by Diakoulaki et al. [36] , CRITIC offers a more efficient technique for generating attribute weights than comparable methods (e.g., analytic hierarchy process, best-worst method, full consistency method, and others) as evident in some of its more recent applications [37–39] . Conversely, EDAS was developed by Ghorabaee et al. [40]  to address conflicting criteria issues with the MADM method; its basis of evaluation is the distance of alternatives to an “average solution”. Recent innovative applications of EDAS have been reported in the literature (e.g., [41–43] ). Text analytics was proposed to construct the decision matrix for the CRITIC-EDAS application. It systematically represents the similarity of the mission statements with the SDGs. In this approach, a similarity measure is obtained via a pre-defined natural language processing algorithm that shows the similarity of the mission statements with the SDGs. Evaluating this similarity across all SDGs offers a comprehensive view of how an HEI mission statement embodies the SDGs. Several studies (e.g., [44–47] ) have employed more recent and modern tools, such as text similarity techniques, embeddings, and natural language processing, to extract similarity measures. These tools are also emerging in research management [47] , the biomedical domain [48] , and harmonization of laws [49] . This innovative technique of generating a decision matrix using the MADM method via text analytics is still considered novel. To illustrate the proposed integrated approach, a case study evaluating the mission statements of the top 300 HEIs in the Philippines (listed in the database of Webometrics—a webpage that utilizes quantitative methods to assist in ranking universities throughout the world) is reported. An online semantic similarity tool, which can generate relatedness scores, is used to analyze the relationship between two phrase patterns, proximity of words, and relevance of texts. Then, the decision matrix was constructed using the generated relatedness scores. The integrated CRITIC-EDAS approach determined the similarity between the mission statements and the 17 SDGs. This systematic approach offers a viable tool for comprehensively evaluating how SDGs are embedded in the strategic direction of HEIs, which can provide inputs with respect to their long-term planning agenda. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2  presents preliminary concepts of the CRITIC and EDAS methods, while Section 3  details the methodology and the proposed integrated CRITIC-EDAS approach. Section 4  presents a comparative analysis of the proposed approach and other comparable methods. Section 5  presents the implications of the findings. Finally, Section 6  concludes the paper.  2 Preliminaries 2.1 The CRITIC method Diakoulaki et al. [36]  developed the CRITIC method, a computational platform that obtains priority weights of attributes/criteria in an MADM problem via the initial decision matrix. It obtains priority weights from the contrast intensity of a criterion and the conflict concentration among criteria in a given set [36,50] . The contrast intensity and degree of variability among scores within each criterion [36]  can be determined using several methods, including variance and entropy. The pairwise linear correlation coefficients among the criteria are utilized to capture their conflicting relationships. Thus, the CRITIC method provides an efficient technique for generating priority weights of criteria/attributes from a decision matrix when compared with other priority weight allocation methods. Additionally, it collects all of the information obtained from the evaluation criteria based on the results of the evaluation matrix [50] . The degree of robustness of CRITIC has been empirically examined in previous studies (e.g., [51] ). Its computational results clearly depict its advantage in obtaining an objective resolution when using the MADM method to analyze a problem. Definition 1 Here, following Diakoulaki et al. [36] , let m   alternatives and n   evaluation criteria c  j    j = 1 , … , n     comprise an MADM problem. Thereafter, the problem in its general form is presented as follows: (1) max c  1   a   , c  2   a   , … , c  n   a   | a ∈ A       for any finite set of alternatives A  .   Based on the concept of an ideal point, each criterion c  j     can be defined by a membership function x  j     where x  j   : c  j   a   ⟶ 0 , 1     . Thus, in criterion j  , a value close to the ideal c  j  ∗     represents the optimal performance, whereas a value far from the anti-ideal value c  j  ∗       represents the worst performance. The steps in determining the criteria weights using the CRITIC method are as follows: Step 1 : Construct the MADM problem with m   alternatives and n   evaluation criteria. Step 2 : Develop the decision-making matrix X = x  i j      m × n     , where x  i j     represents the evaluation score of alternative i i = 1 , … , m      with respect to criterion j j = 1 , … , n     . Step 3:  Compute the normalized matrix N = n  i j      m × n     , where the normalized score n  i j     describes a linear normalization of x  i j    . It is given by (2) n  i j   = x  i j   − x  j  ∗      x  j  ∗   − x  j  ∗        ∀ i , j     where x  j  ∗   = max  i   x  i j      and x  j  ∗     = min  i   x  i j      for j = 1 , … , n   . Step 4:  Generate vectors n  j     denoting the normalized scores of all m   alternatives. (3) n  j   = n  1 j   , n  2 j   , … , n  m j      ∀ j      Step 5:  Compute the standard deviation of each n  j     using the following routine calculations: (4) σ  j   = ∑  i = 1  m   n  i j   − n  ¯   j      2    m      ∀ j     where n  ¯   j   = ∑  i = 1  m   n  i j    m      Step 6:  Construct the symmetric matrix R = r  j k      n × n      where r  j k     denotes the linear correlation coefficient of two vectors n  j     and n  k     using the formula: (5) r  j k   = ∑  i = 1  m   ( n  i j −   n  ¯   j   )  ( n  i k −   n  ¯   k   )   ∑  i = 1  m   n  i j   − n  ¯   j      2   ∑  i = 1  m   n  i k   − n  ¯   k      2        ∀ j , k ∈ 1 , … , n       where r  j k   ∈ − 1 , 1     . Evidently, when j = k   , r  j k   = 1   . Step 7:  Compute the amount of information z  j     as follows: (6) z  j   = σ  j   ∑  k = 1  n   ( 1 − r  j k   )   ∀ j     where the higher value of z  j     implies that the criterion j   contains more information. Step 8:  Determine the priority weights of criteria using the following: (7) w  j   = z  j    ∑  k = 1  n   z  k      ∀ j       2.2 The EDAS method The EDAS method, developed by Ghorabaee et al. [40] , uses an average solution to appraise the alternatives. In this method, two measures are considered when addressing the desirability of the alternatives: (1) positive distance from the average matrix P   and (2) negative distance from the average matrix N  [52] . These two measures determine the difference between each solution (alternative) and the average solution. Other MADM methods, such as the VlseKriteriżka Optimizacija I Komoromisno Resenje (VIKOR) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), determine the optimal alternative by computing the distance between the ideal and negative ideal solutions. However, the optimal alternative in this method is obtained from the distance average solution [40] . However, the evaluation of alternatives evolved according to higher values of P   and N  . This implies that lower values of N   and higher values of P   indicate that the alternative is better than the average solution. The computational steps for EDAS are discussed as follows: Step 1.  Choose the most important j   criteria j = 1 , … , n     that describe i   alternatives i = 1 , … , m     for a specific decision problem. Step 2.  Compute the decision-making matrix X = x  i j      m × n     , where x  i j     denotes the performance value of the i  th alternative on the j  th criterion. Step 3.  Determine the average solution V = v  j      1 × n      with respect to all criteria as follows: (8) v  j   = ∑  i = 1  m   x  i j    m    ∀ j      Step 4.  Compute the positive distance from the average matrix P = p  i j      m × n      and the negative distance from the average matrix N = n  i j      m × n     , according to the type of criteria (i.e., benefit and cost) as follows. If j  th criterion is a benefit (maximizing) criterion, (9) p  i j   = max 0 , x  i j   − v  j        v  j      ∀ i , j    (10) n  i j   = max 0 , v  j   − x  i j        v  j      ∀ i , j       Otherwise, if the j  th criterion is a cost (minimizing) criterion, (11) p  i j   = max 0 , v  j   − x  i j        v  j      ∀ i , j    (12) n  i j   = max 0 , x  i j   − v  j        v  j      ∀ i , j       where p  i j     and n  i j     denote the positive and negative distances of alternative i   from the average solution, respectively, in terms of criterion j  . Step 5.  Determine the weighted sums p  ¯   i     and n  ¯   i     for alternative i   as follows: (13) p  ¯   i   = ∑  j = 1  n   w  j   p  i j    ∀ i    (14) n  ¯   i   = ∑  j = 1  n   w  j   n  i j    ∀ i       where w  j     is the priority weight of the j  th criterion and ∑  j = 1  n   w  j   = 1   . Step 6.  Construct the normalized scores of all i   alternatives p  ˆ    i     and n  ˆ    i     through the following: (15) p  ˆ    i   = p  ¯   i    max  i   p  ¯   i        ∀ i    (16) n  ˆ    i   = 1 − n  ¯   i    max  i   n  ¯   i        ∀ i       Step 7.  Calculate the appraisal score a  i     for all alternatives, as follows: (17) a  i   = 1  2   p  ˆ    i   + n  ˆ    i      ∀ i     where 0 ≤ a  i   ≤ 1   . Step 8.  Rank the alternatives according to decreasing values of the appraisal score a  i    . The alternative with the highest a  i     is the best alternative.   3 Methodology 3.1 Data gathering Establishing mission statements is a component of organizations’ strategic process. Amidst competing interests, HEIs make declarations to mark a focal point, forge overarching directions, and guide their stakeholders to act toward a common purpose. In 2015, the UN released a blueprint to achieve a sustainable future through SDGs. As one of the original 51 charter members of the UN and a current participating nation, the Philippines signed the partnership framework for sustainable development together with the UN Country Team. This framework supported a stronghold for strategic partnerships through the collaboration of member countries. Eight years after the publication of the UN SDGs, several nations still desired synergistic efforts among organizations—a recognized pathway for achieving sustainability; however, they were disappointed with the results [53] . A call for a systems approach was needed, especially in infrastructure represented by interdependencies [54] , such as HEIs. Explicitly integrating the SDGs within organizational strategic statements could lead directly to collective efforts within and between HEIs, with the goal of achieving SDGs. This study uses a systematic approach to evaluate the degree to which UN SDGs are embedded within the mission statements of HEIs using a case study of the top 300 HEIs in the Philippines according to Webometrics (a web page run by the research group Cybermetrics Lab, which utilizes quantitative methods to rank universities worldwide based on their scientific activities, impact, openness, and excellence rank). A mission statement sets an organizational direction and roadmap of how an organization can achieve its vision. The UN SDGs, which are statements of “how to”, are more similar to the mission than those vision statements. Thus, it is more appropriate to evaluate the similarity with the SDGs using mission than vision statements. Each mission statement obtained for the study was derived from the HEI’s institutional website. The application of the proposed multi-attribute evaluation based on an integrated CRITIC-EDAS approach requires the decision matrix x  i j    . In the proposed approach, each x  i j     is obtained through a semantic similarity tool (a feature available for free on the Bytesview website); it is a data analysis tool with two input cells capable of extracting insights from unstructured text or data. Inputting the mission statement of HEI (alternative) i   on the first input cell and SDG (criterion) j   on the other input cell on the semantic similarity tool will detect the correspondence of the two documents and produce a “relatedness” score in the form of a percentage. This “relatedness” score is hereby considered as the similarity of a specific mission statement and a specific SDG. Fifty-six of the 300 HEIs mentioned previously were discarded because of fused vision and mission statements, lack of available data, unsecured webpages, or inaccessible institutional websites, resulting in 244 HEIs in the final analysis.  3.2 Proposed methodological framework for the integrated CRITIC-EDAS approach The proposed methodological framework comprises the following three phases: (1) constructing the decision matrix; (2) implementing the CRITIC method; and (3) ranking the HEIs via the EDAS method. In this framework, the weights generated from Phase (2) are integrated into Phase (3). Fig. 1  illustrates the proposed procedure of the CRITIC-EDAS approach.  Phase (1). Constructing the decision matrix.  Step 1.  Determine the list of decision criteria (UN SDGs) and alternatives (HEIs). The 17 SDGs formulated by the UN were considered the decision attributes j  , j = 1 , … , n   . These attributes were utilized to evaluate the HEIs—specifically, the top 300 Philippine HEIs—based on the Webometrics Ranking of World Universities (for the Philippines; [55] ). Step 2.  The mission statements of the identified HEIs are obtained and the SDGs are described. From the original list of 300 HEIs, 56 were eliminated for the following reasons: (a) combined vision and mission statements, and (b) lack of available data owing to unsecured pages or inaccessible institutional websites. Consequently, only 244 institutions were included in this study. Thus, the decision matrix comprises 244 HEIs as alternatives and 17 SDGs as criteria, forming a 244 × 17 matrix. The list of HEIs is presented in Appendix A  and the list of SDGs is shown in Table 1 .  Table 1  presents the UN SDGs, which have advanced the concept of sustainability and provides a framework for organizations to integrate sustainability agendas into their operations. Step 3.  Obtain the relatedness scores x  i j    . The relatedness scores were generated using the Bytesview semantic similarity tool [56] . They are presented in a decision matrix, which can be found in the Supplementary Material section. The score x  i j     of the i  th HEI to the j  th SDG is utilized to construct the evaluation matrix X = x  i j      m × n     . Fig. 2  presents the user interface and the steps involved in generating the scores using the BytesView semantic similarity tool. Algorithm 1 presents the technical steps followed to test the similarity of texts.  Algorithm 1. Process flow of the semantic similarity algorithm Start  Step 1. Normalization: Transforming the text into lowercase and removing all special characters to create a uniform text format. Step 2. Tokenization: Splitting text (primarily made up of words or phrases) into different tokens. Step 3. Removal of stop words and punctuations: Stop words are most commonly used in a language, along with punctuations; they do not add value to the text. Step 4. Stemming: The process of obtaining the root words. Sometimes this root is not equal to the morphological root of the word; however, this step aims to map related words to the same stem. Step 5. Lemmatization: This is the process of obtaining the same word for a group of inflected word forms. The simplest way to do this is to use a dictionary. Step 6. Evaluation of embeddings: The similarity of preprocessed words is tested from a word library to generate a relatedness score. End  Phase (2). Implementing the CRITIC method  Steps 4 and 5 discuss the implementation of the CRITIC method for assigning priority weights to the SDGs. Step 4 . Construct the normalized decision matrix. Using the evaluation matrix X  , the normalized decision matrix N   is computed using Eq. (2) . Step 5.  Compute the standard deviation. The vector n  j     is generated through the normalized scores of all m   HEIs. Vector n  j     is obtained using Eq. (3) , and the standard deviations for all n  j     is calculated using Eq. (4) . Step 6.  Construct the symmetric matrix R = r  j k      n × n      The symmetric matrix R   is generated using Eq. (5) , where r  j k     denotes the linear correlation coefficient of two vectors n  j     and n  k    , j , k ∈ 1 , … , n     . Step 7.  Obtain the amount of information z  j    . The amount of information z  j     for all attributes j   is computed using Eq. (6) . Step 8 . Determine the priority weights w  j    . Using Eq. (7) , the priority weights w  j     of all n   attributes are generated; these are presented in Table 2 .  The results of the CRITIC method are presented in Table 2 . Apparently, SDG13 (climate action) yields the highest priority weight, followed by SDG10 (reduced inequalities) and SDG15 (life on land). SDG9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure) exhibits the least priority weight. Therefore, HEIs vary in their views on actions related to climate change; they can also be discriminated against based on the aspect of uplifting the socioeconomic status of different stakeholders and promoting skills-based programs that help increase the human capital of some rural communities. Prioritizing SDG15 is crucial in view of the impending climate-related dilemmas. Interestingly, they have limited interest in SDG9, which may be due to their low innovation potential. Phase (3). Ranking the HEIs via the EDAS method  Steps 9 to 11 illustrate the application of the EDAS method in ranking HEIs based on their alignment with the SDGs. Step 9.  Determine the average solution V = v  j      1 × n     . Eq. (8)  is utilized to compute the average solution v  j     with respect to all j   SDGs. The resulting matrices are presented in Table 3 .  Step 10.  Calculate the positive distance from the average and negative distance from the average. The positive distance from the average matrix P = p  i j      m × n      is obtained using Eq. (9)  if the j  th SDG is beneficial, and using Eq. (11)  if the j  th SDG is non-beneficial. On the contrary, the negative distance from the average matrix N = n  i j      m × n      is computed using Eq. (10)  if the j  th SDG is beneficial, and using Eq. (12)  if the j  th SDG is non-beneficial. Step 11 . Determine the weighted sum matrix P  ¯  = p  ¯   i      m × 1      and N  ¯  = n  ¯   i      m × 1     . For all m   HEIs, Eqs. (13) and (14)  are utilized to generate p  ¯   i     and n  ¯   i    , respectively. Step 12 . Construct the normalized score matrix P  ˆ   = p  ˆ    i      m × 1      and N  ˆ   = n  ˆ    i      m × 1     . Eqs. (15) and (16)  are used to calculate p  ˆ    i     and n  ˆ    i     for each alternative i  . Step 13.  Determine the priority ranking of HEIs. The appraisal score a  i     for all HEIs, generated using Eq. (17) , is utilized to obtain the HEIs’ priority rank. The HEI with the highest a  i     is considered as having the highest priority rank. The priority rankings are listed in Table 4 .  Table 4  presents HEIs’ priority ranks. As observed, on top of the list is the Mariano Marcos State University, and San Sebastian College Recoletos de Cavite is at the bottom.   4 Comparative analysis A comparative analysis was completed to examine how the integrated approach used in this study compares with other MADM methods and ensure that the results are not achieved using a whimsical approach. In choosing a subset of methods among an array of MADM methods, we proposed two primary qualifications: (1) the method is based on an m × n    decision matrix and (2) the algorithm of the method contains limited parameters, unlike some popular methods (e.g., Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE) and ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité (ELECTRE)). These qualifications were set to appropriately compare the performance of EDAS with other closely available MADM methods. For this analysis, the following four MADM methods were compared: (1) Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS; [57] ); (2) Combinative Distance-Based Assessment (CODAS; [58] ); (3) Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo; [59] ); and (4) Ranking of Alternatives through Functional Mapping of Criterion Sub-Intervals into a Single Interval (RAFSI; [60] ). For brevity, the details of these methods are not discussed here. Like the integrated CRITIC-EDAS approach, the CRITIC method was used to obtain the priority weights of the attributes/criteria (i.e., SDGs) for the TOPSIS, CODAS, CoCoSo, and RAFSI methods. The results from the five integrated methods, including EDAS, result in the priority rankings of the alternatives (i.e., HEIs). Fig. 3  presents the differentiating priority ranking of HEIs with respect to the five integrated methods. Fig. 3  reveals only minimal differences in the ranking of the HEIs among the five methods. Thus, the integrated CRITIC-EDAS approach does not yield conflicting results with other known MADM methodologies. To further verify the validity and consistency of the relationship between the priority rankings from the five methodologies, pairwise Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients were obtained, as presented in Table 5 .   Evidently, a strong relationship exists between the priority ranking results of the five methodologies, where ρ = 0 . 9695    is the minimum correlation coefficient value. This analysis indicates that the results from the proposed integrated CRITIC-EDAS approach exhibit strong consistency with those of other MADM methods.  5 Discussion and insights This study evaluated how well the strategic directions (represented by the mission statements) of HEIs were aligned with the 17 UN SDGs. By viewing the evaluation process as an MADM problem, the similarities of the mission statements and the SDGs were quantified using a “relatedness” score generated from text analytics or semantic similarity. An integrated CRITIC-EDAS method was utilized owing to the CRITIC’s efficacy in generating the SDGs’ priority weights and EDAS method’s efficacy in evaluating alternatives (i.e., HEIs) under multiple criteria. The proposed evaluation framework was demonstrated using a case study of the top 300 Philippian HEIs (obtained from the Webometrics ranking). Overall, 244 HEIs were included in the final analysis. As presented in Table 2 , SDG13 (climate action) yields the highest priority weight, followed by SDG10 (reduced inequalities), and SDG15 (life on land). SDG9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure) has the lowest priority weight. Therefore, HEIs place greater strategic emphasis on climate change by highlighting risk reduction strategies, mitigation actions, or adaptation initiatives. This insight may be brought about by idiosyncrasies in the Philippines, which is one of the countries greatly affected by climate change impacts in the region. Being a developing economy where income inequalities are prevalent, HEIs tend to focus on strategic directions that uplift the students’ or stakeholders’ socioeconomic status. Additionally, they focus on promoting skills-based academic programs that eventually help diversify income, particularly in rural communities where half of the country’s population resides. Accordingly, as an archipelagic country in the Pacific, natural resource is a critical point of interest among HEIs in view of the looming climate crisis; thus, prioritizing SDG15 would be critical. Interestingly, SDG9 (build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation) receives low interest among HEIs; this is evident in the widening gap in innovation capabilities in comparison to the more developed countries in the region (e.g., Singapore). The findings regarding the priority weights of the SDGs reflect the pressing problems in the Philippines over the last several years. According to the findings, the mission statements of the top-ranked HEIs do not have high relatedness scores in all SDGs; however, most SDGs have been incorporated into the mission statements. For instance, while the Bukidnon State University and the Central Bicol State University of Agriculture (both in the top ten) have incorporated almost all of the SDGs into their mission statements, their mission statements have zero to low similarity scores with SDG 10 (reducing inequalities). It can also be observed that private and non-religious HEIs are more likely to include incorporate SDGs in their mission statements than public and religious universities. Indeed, the bottom tier of the ranking list in Table 4  contains HEIs managed by religious orders or organizations, consistent with the insights of Lopez and Martin [61] . The ranking of HEIs in Table 4  provides two systems perspective on how similar the mission statements of HEIs are with the SDGs. First, the resulting ranking can serve as a reference for other HEIs in case they intend to align their strategic planning with comparable HEIs on the list. Second, it provides motivations to revisit their mission statements in view of the different SDGs. This may result in a high-level discussion in university governance to strengthen their strategic directions, consistent with the intentions of the SDGs, with particular emphasis on those areas where they perform poorly. Methodologically, the proposed evaluation approach contributes to the domain literature on MADM and sustainability in higher education. Evaluation based on objective data via semantic similarity scores offers a new outlook in the relevant literature on multi-attribute evaluation. Instead of producing subjective data based on decision-makers’ knowledge and expertise, the decision matrix is systematically generated from a commercially available text analytics algorithm capable of generating the desired evaluation in terms of the similarity between two texts. The conceptual framework is similar to plagiarism detection software (e.g., Turnitin). The quality of the dataset now depends on the power of the associated algorithm and not on some biases of decision-makers. The proposed integration of CRITIC-EDAS adds to the list of computationally efficient hybrid MADM methods capable of solving complex, large-scale, multi-attribute evaluation problems with less mathematical or computational proficiency requirements from analysts. When applied to problems demanding subjective judgments, the integrated approach merely requires minimal cognitive workload from decision-makers compared to other methods, such as the analytic hierarchy process, best-worst method, or outranking methods (e.g., PROMETHEE and ELECTRE).  However, it must be emphasized that the ranking of HEIs reported in this study must be treated with utmost caution for two reasons. First, this study is not directly considered a sustainability evaluation of HEIs. It provides no information on the degree to which top-ranked HEIs translate their mission statements into actual, tangible, and verifiable initiatives that effectively impact SDGs. Translating these “fancy” statements into actual sustainability initiatives remains a challenge to HEI governance. Additionally, the study offers no guidelines on how these mission statements must be translated into strategies to improve the sustainability performance of HEIs. As emphasized earlier, the ranking only reflects the similarity between the mission statements and SDGs; the specific actions are beyond the scope of this study. The only implication of this study is associated with designing mission statements to effectively portray the SDGs. Second, the ranking does not intend to describe the “sustainability” level of HEIs’ mission statements. The similarity between mission statements and the SDGs may not be equivalent to the sustainability level of HEI governance. Although, some may contend that whenever coherence with the SDGs becomes more observable, HEIs can successfully plan and implement initiatives derived from well-designed mission statements. The complexity of the concept of sustainability (perhaps illustrated via sustainability indicators) is beyond the scope of this study. Finally, the evaluation resulting from the decision matrix was highly dependent on the performance of the semantic similarity algorithm. Algorithms that are more powerful can provide more meaningful results. Nevertheless, the proposed evaluation framework offers proof of the concept of this research direction.  6 Conclusion and future works The deployment of the UN SDGs has provided organizations with a blueprint on how to integrate a sustainability agenda into their core processes and decision-making. Despite the concerted efforts of countries to contribute to specific goals, some are lagging, especially with respect to education, thus making sustainability in higher education more concerning. While salient advances have occurred, holistically aligning the strategic directions of HEIs with SDGs has garnered limited attention in the domain literature. In this study, we filled this gap by offering a comprehensive evaluation approach that measures the similarity of strategic statements of HEIs, particularly focusing on the mission statements and the SDGs. The evaluation framework is viewed as an MADM problem, wherein multiple HEIs were gauged under multiple attributes in terms of the SDGs. We leveraged the computational efficiency of the CRITIC method in assigning priority weights of decision attributes and the EDAS method for evaluating the alternatives (i.e., HEIs) in large-scale problems, and combined them into an integrated CRITIC-EDAS approach. The decision matrix, which serves as the initial platform of the proposed CRITIC-EDAS evaluation, was generated from a semantic similarity tool that assigns a degree of relatedness between the mission statements and the SDGs based on a pre-defined algorithm. As a proof of concept of the proposed evaluation framework, a case study of the top 300 HEIs in the Philippines based on the Webometrics database was reported in this study. The findings indicate that HEIs lend the highest priority to SDG13 (climate action), SDG10 (reduced inequalities), and SDG15 (life on land) in that particular order. Meanwhile, they lend the lowest priority to SDG9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure). These insights reflect some pressing concerns regarding Philippine HEIs. The results of the evaluation based on CRITIC-EDAS present a ranking of HEIs that can be utilized by HEI governance as a reference in aligning their strategic direction with comparable HEIs. They will also motivate discussions pertaining to improving mission statements considering the SDGs. Nevertheless, the evaluation results must be interpreted cautiously, as they neither intend to reflect the sustainability status of HEIs nor provide guidelines on translating the mission statements into tangible initiatives that would effectively portray the SDGs. The results must be construed solely as the similarity between the strategic directions of HEIs and the SDGs. Such similarities may serve as an indication of the core of the HEIs’ mission statements relative to the SDGs. Additionally, we implemented a comparative analysis with other MADM tools and found a strong similarity in the results despite the computational efficiency of the proposed CRITIC-EDAS approach. However, this study has limitations that should be addressed in the future. In particular, the quality of the information displayed in the decision matrix depends highly on the semantic similarity algorithm. Future work can focus on designing a more robust algorithm that accurately reflects the similarity between the mission statements and the SDGs. Moreover, a more robust approach can incorporate the uncertainty resulting from text analytics inefficacy. The use of fuzzy set theory and its extensions—such as intuitionistic fuzzy, Pythagorean fuzzy, spherical fuzzy, and Fermatean fuzzy sets—may augment the quality of the information in the decision matrix. Furthermore, future work may explore other strategic statements, such as vision statements, goals, and objectives, to comprehensively capture the strategic directions of HEIs. Some strategic directions that HEIs intend to undergo may not be conveyed in their mission statements; they might also be reflected in their goals and objectives. Generally, examining how to translate mission statements into concrete initiatives that effectively address SDGs would be an interesting future research direction for practitioners.
