                  Tiruchirappalli City the fourth largest municipal corporation in Tamilnadu, India is witnessing accelerated urban growth. The city has exacerbated the microclimate indicating a significant increase in land surface temperature. The study aims to establish the differentiation of land surface temperature of city between 2001, 2011, and 2021 of summer months using Landsat images to examine the effects of urban heat island. The results shows that the temperature ranged from 31.23°C to 37.45°C between 2011 and 2021. The assessed land surface temperature (LST) is correlated and the result shows a positive correlation between the LST-normalised difference built-up index (NDBI) and a negative correlation between the LST-normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and a weak correlation between LST-BSI and LST-MNDWI of summer months examined. Further, the urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI) of the city is analysed. The thermal condition of the city during April has significantly changed from 5.14 % of area in 2001 to 12.19 % of area in 2021 (UTFVI >0.020, Strongest) of worst ecological valuation index. The selected city is experiencing major thermal conditions (UTFVI 0.010–0.015) of ecological evaluation index from bad to worst. This study will help mitigate the urban heat island effect and promote sustainable development for rapid urbanization.

Tiruchirappalli City the fourth largest municipal corporation in Tamilnadu, India is witnessing accelerated urban growth. The city has exacerbated the microclimate indicating a significant increase in land surface temperature. The study aims to establish the differentiation of land surface temperature of city between 2001, 2011, and 2021 of summer months using Landsat images to examine the effects of urban heat island. The results shows that the temperature ranged from 31.23°C to 37.45°C between 2011 and 2021. The assessed land surface temperature (LST) is correlated and the result shows a positive correlation between the LST-normalised difference built-up index (NDBI) and a negative correlation between the LST-normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and a weak correlation between LST-BSI and LST-MNDWI of summer months examined. Further, the urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI) of the city is analysed. The thermal condition of the city during April has significantly changed from 5.14 % of area in 2001 to 12.19 % of area in 2021 (UTFVI >0.020, Strongest) of worst ecological valuation index. The selected city is experiencing major thermal conditions (UTFVI 0.010–0.015) of ecological evaluation index from bad to worst. This study will help mitigate the urban heat island effect and promote sustainable development for rapid urbanization.

Therefore,city dwellers are exposed to the risks and impacts of climate change.With 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was unveiled to preserve the environment, promoting human prosperity and peace, and reviving international collaboration for sustainable development (Krehbiel et al., 2017 ). SDG 11: Making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable specifies the importance of sustainable development of cities (Zhang et al., 2019 ). Modern city is a complex system with various living components like building, transport and water bodies. The overlying atmosphere of the city is significantly altered because of changes in urban forms and functions, with a rise of 2°c to 3°c warmer than the surrounding environment (Grimmond et al., 2015 ). This particular phenomenon related to urbanization is termed as Urban Heat Island effect (UHI) (Jr. & Rodgers, 2001 ;Santamouris et al., 2007 ;Imhoff et al., 2010 ;Li et al., 2012 ). UHI studies are broadly classified into two categories: AUHI (Atmospheric Urban Heat island) and SUHI (Surface Urban Heat Island). This paper will focus on Surface Urban heat island referring to the difference in LST between urban and rural landscape. The evaluation of thermal behaviour from this aspect will assist in greater understanding of the comparison of the heat island effect among cities in addition to analyse how urbanization affects SUHI. Because of rapidly rising LST and harmful pollutants in urban environments, 68% of the world's population will be vulnerable to SUHI by 2050. Initially conventional methods such as gathering filed based air temperature measurements from urban areas were predominantly used for UHI monitoring. However, UHI investigations have become more precise and practical without much expense and labour due to the availability of satellite based thermal data.LST estimation was mostly limited to regional scale through coarse resolution NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] and AVHRR [Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer](Weng et al., 2004 ). Local and regional scale UHI research have been made possible by the development of moderate resolution through thermal infrared products. According to Hachem et al. (2012)  Land surface temperature (LST) has been applied in various UHI studies. Many heat balance studies, climate modelling and global climate change research utilize LST which is derived from satellite imagery. LST is defined as observed ground temperature. The key variable to understand the effects of land cover change can be determined from remotely sensed thermal infrared (TIR) imagery, OLI (Operational Land Imager), and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) which is linked with urban thermal patterns in various ways (Weng, 2012 ;Rinner & Hussain, 2011 ). (Hunt & Watkiss, 2011 ) conducted study at the city level to aid decision-making for adaptation and mitigation strategies related to the impacts of climate change The Most popular indices for determining vegetation and built-up are normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalised difference built-up index (NDBI) which are inevitably used in LST Studies (Sobrino et al., 2004 ; Zha et al., 2003 ). The modified normalised difference water Index is widely used water index and is commonly used in LST related research studies (Guha et al., 2017 ). In urban landscape, bare soil is an essential component and plays a major role in the urban setting. Hence, the classification of bare soil in urban areas using remote sensing for evaluating UHI at various spatial-temporal scale is important (Carlan et al., 2020 ;Nguyen et al., 2021 ). A Recent study by Rajagopal et al. (2023)  reviewed recent developments in the impact of environmental measures on UHI which summarized variables such as LST,NDVI,MNDWI,BSI plays a crucial role in understanding the UHI phenomena.Various UHI studies have been carried out in several cities to comprehend the current thermal aberration in urban centres and its impact on city residents. Various thermal comfort indices have been applied to analyse the urban temperature rise and its impact on the quality of life of city's residents. However, UTFVI is a validated Index and is widely used to evaluate surface urban heat Island [SUHI] and to evaluate the thermal quality of urban spaces (Gala, 2016 ; Kafy et al., 2021 ; Maithani et al., 2020 ; Renard et al., 2019 ) (Ahmad et al., 2019 ) studied the diurnal variation of LST during day and night time in Delhi, Agra and Aligarh. (Mehrotra et al., 2018 ) used Landsat 8 image for studying the Land surface pattern of Mumbai city. (P. Singh et al., 2017 ) studied the LST of Lucknow for the years 2002 and 2014. (Mohammed Yusuff et al., 2017 ; Pandey et al., 2012 ) has carried forward the study showing the temperature difference in Delhi. Recently, UHI studies have been carried forward in cities of Vijayawada and Guntur (Kusuma et al., 2017 )Ahmedabad (Joshi et al., 2015 ;Goswami et al., 2016 ), Kolkata (Gazi & Mondal, 2018 ), Chennai (Amirtham, 2016 ) and Nagpur (Kotharkar & Bagade, 2018 ) and so on. Few studies have focussed on Urban Heat Island Identification and temporal changes of LST values identified for Trichy district, Tamilnadu.(Rajan et al., 2022 ) examined temporal changes in LST values of Trichy district for years 2015 and 2020 and reported growing urbanization is linked with rise in LST temperature value. C R et al. (2021)  evaluated LST, NDVI, NDBI and UHI identification over Trichy city for the year 2018 and have stated the identification of UHI pockets along the central regions of river Cauvery from south-east to south-west parts of the city.(Badugu et al., 2023 ) also revealed the presence of urban heat island by using MODIS11A2 of 1000 m coarse spatial resolution. However, recent analysis to compute and compare the LST with spectral indices to analyse the effect of UHI with Landsat images and to relate with the thermal comfort of the city Tiruchirappalli has not been done yet. Therefore, this study will potentially suggest ways to achieve SDG 11 for the developing city and the objectives include.I. To identify the urban hotspot in Trichy by deriving and analysing LST values for the years 2001, 2011, 2021 of April, May, and June months from satellite Images.  II. To determine how the LST in Trichy City relates to the spectral indices NDVI, NDBI, MNDWI, and BSI.  III. To evaluate the thermal condition and SUHI of the city using the Urban Thermal field variance index.  IV. To study the impact of UHI on LST across wards between the years 2001, 2011, and 2021 of April, May, and June months of the city.     2 Materials and methods 2.1 Tiruchirappalli city Trichy also known as Tiruchirappalli the fourth largest urban agglomeration in the state of Tamilnadu is located at latitude 10°48′18″ N and longitude 78°41′08″ E situated along the basins of river Cauvery (Fig. 1  ). The geographical area of the city covers 167.23 sqm and is proposed to expand 211 sqm as per the State Planning Authority (Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, 2019 ). The city is subdivided into four zones for effective administration [Ariyamangalam, K.Abishekapuram, Ponmalai and Srirangam] With 65 Wards. Tiruchirappalli city also serves as an important centres for trade and commerce in the state of Tamilnadu. The city experiences hot and dry climate with high temperature and less humidity and few prominent hillocks are present in the city.The river Cauvery and river Coleroon transverse the city and forms the natural boundary along the northern part of the city. Due to the presence of the these rivers the city is greener in the northern part compared to its other areas. As per Census 2011 the growth rate of the city has increased to 33.13% between the year 1991 and 2011.Accordingly, April, May, and June months of 2001, 2011 were considered and 2021 has been taken as the latest year for the current study.  2.2 Data sets For this research datasets from two decades 2001, 2011, 2021 were selected. Landsat 5TM and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS with 30 m spatial resolution were acquired from USGS earth explorer interface (Table 1  ). To determine the patterns of UHI and the LST the thermal bands of Landsat data [Thematic Mapper/Thermal infrared sensors] have been widely used (Zhang et al., 2017 ;Guha et al., 2018 ;Yang et al., 2020 ) For the year 2001, 2011 Landsat 5TM image and for the year 2021 Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS were considered with minimum cloud cover and the same date of the selected months of the corresponding years were selected based on very less atmospheric and seasonal effects (Emran et al., 2018 ). Though it is distinct that LST varies significantly depending on the season and is relatively higher during the warmer months of the year due to high air temperatures. Hence, this study is will focus on the summer months April, May, and June for LST assessment where the sky remains cloud free, low in precipitation and wind speed. This study uses the process of DN (Digital Number) converted to TOA (Top of Atmospheric) radiance of standard calibration method which is applied for Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS given in the eq (1) and eq (2)  (Weng et al., 2004 ;Mallick et al., 2008 ;Barsi et al., 2014 )  2.3 Methodology The study methodology is given in the (Fig. 2  ). The LST, NDBI, NDVI, MNDWI, BSI for 2001, 2011, 2021 of April, May,June months were identified from Landsat 5TM and Landsat 8OLI/TIRS satellite images. The image processing, mapping and analysis is performed by ArcGIS 10.7.1 software. Urban hotspots, UHI intensity, Urban Thermal field Variance Index were identified. Based on the results extracted the UHI effects for Tiruchirappalli was evaluated quantitatively.  2.4 Estimation of land surface temperature LST is an essential parameter for evaluating the UHI effect and surface atmosphere interaction (Mallick et al., 2013 ). The thermal pattern of an urban region is determined by the composition and physical characteristics of land surface features. Top of Atmosphere (TOA) radiance from satellite infrared sensors generates the blackbody temperature or brightness temperature. In order to determine the top of atmosphere (TOA) radiance, the digital number of the thermal bands [Band 6 of TM and Band 10 of OLI/TIRS] were initially converted to spectral radiance. Using the calibration constant (K1, K2) of the Landsat dataset and by assuming that the earth's surface is a blackbody, the brightness temperature (Tb) values were predicted from the spectral radiance map. However, it does not represent the actual surface temperature because it refers blackbody. Hence, the brightness temperature (BT) was further corrected to account for the Land cover type for estimating emissivity (ɛ). Land surface emissivity is calculated by the percentage of vegetation cover estimated from NDVI which is taken as an input parameter (Weng, 2009 ) Finally, LST was derived from the Landsat thermal infrared band data by Eq. (1)  and (2) . 2.4.1 Top of atmosphere (TOA) radiance For Landsat 5 TM (1) L λ = ( L m a x λ − L m i n λ  )  ( Q c a l m a x − Q c a l m i n  )  X ( Q c a l − Q c a l m i n  )  + L m i n λ        Where Lλ = Spectral Radiance at the sensor (Watts/*m2 *sr/µm) QCal = Calibrated and Quantized pixel digital number (DN) Lmaxλ=Spectral radiance scaled to maximum calibrated pixel value (Qcalmax) Lminλ= Spectral radiance scaled to minimum calibrated pixel value (Qcalmin) Qcalmin=the minimum quantized and calibrated pixel value DN=1 Qcalmax=the maximum quantized and calibrated pixel value DN = 256 For Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS  (2) L λ = M L * Q C a l + A L      Where ML = the value of radiance multiplicative rescaling factor obtained from metadata of specific satellite data (RADIANCE_MULT_BAND_x) QCal = Calibrated and Quantized pixel digital number (DN) AL= the value of radiance additive rescaling factor obtained from metadata of specific satellite data (RADIANCE_ADD_BAND_x)  2.4.2 Top of atmosphere (TOA) brightness temperature The obtained Lλ value, it is then converted into brightness temperature after converting the digital number (DN) to radiance with the thermal constant acquired from metadata file. Brightness temperature is the real temperature, the real temperature that the satellite measures under the condition that the emissivity corresponds to one as given by Chander et al. (2009) (3) T B = K 2  l n ⁡ ( K 1  L λ   + 1  )    − 273.15      Where TB= TOA Brightness temperature Lλ=Spectral radiance at the sensor (Watts/*m2 *sr/µm) K1, K2 are the calibration constants obtained from the metadata. In order to obtain the result in Celsius −273.15°°C was added to Eq. (3) .  2.4.3 Normalized differential vegetation index [NDVI] Distinguishing between different land cover types can be effectively done with spectral indices. NDVI is widely used spectral index which assess the level of green cover (Kumari & Sarma, 2017 ). By using this numerical indicator the relation between vegetation features and spectral reflectance can be enabled. NDVI is calculated using the reflectance of the NIR (Near infrared) and reflectance of the red band. It supports in analysing the vegetation condition and function as a tool for change detection in green spaces on spatial-temporal analysis (Majumdar & Sivaramakrishnan, 2020 ). NDVI ranges from −1 to +1.(4) N D V I = N I R − R e d  N I R + R e d        Where NIR = Band 5, Red =Band 4 as proposed by Kriegler et al. (1969) .  2.4.4 Land surface emissitivity [LSE] To estimate LST, understanding the land surface emissivity [LSE] is necessary as it deals with surface's relative ability to radiate energy and the ratio of black body's radiative energy to the land surface based on Plank's law. LSE can be assessed using various techniques in remote sensing and this current study uses NDVI based on emissivity correction method as given by Carlson and Ripley (1997) .(5)  PV  = ( NDVI − NDV I min   NDVI + NDV I max    )   2       Where NDVIMin  = −1 Minimum DN value from NDVI image NDVImax  = 1 Maximum DN value from NDVI image The average emissivity of a component on earth's surface is known as LSE and can be calculated using the below equation proposed by Sobrino et al. (2004) .(6) ɛ = 0.004Pv  + 0.986    Where ɛ is the land surface emissivity (LSE) and Pv  is the proportion of vegetation derived from NDVI.  2.4.5 Retrieval of land surface temperature (LST) Consequently LST has been estimated using TOA brightness temperature, wavelength of emitted radiance and corrected Land surface emissivity (LSE) using the below equation by Artis and Carnahan (1982) .(7) L S T = T b  1 + λ * ( Tb p  )  * In  ε         P = h  x  c  σ     = 1.438 × 10–2  mk Where LST=Land surface temperature,=effective wavelength of the emitted radiance (Kafy et al., 2020 ; Ullah et al., 2019 ;Rahman et al., 2017 ) et al. 2017), P  = h  x C/σ (1.438 × 10–2 mk), h  = Planks constant (6.626 × 10–34 JS,C = Velocity of light (2.998 × 108 ms-2 ), σ = Boltzmaan constant (1.38 × 10–23  J/K) and ɛ = Land surface emissivity   2.5 Normalized difference built-up index [NDBI] NDBI index is used for quantifying the built-up areas or artificial construction area in urban pockets of the settlement. NDBI index uses two bands for mapping shortwave infrared and infrared band proposed by Zha et al. (2003) . NDBI ranges between −1 to +1.(8) N D B I = S W I R  −  N I R  S W I R  + N I R        The built-up area is indicated as positive value whereas the availability of physical features indicates lower value. NDBI Index is used primarily for built-up area mapping.  2.6 Modified normalized difference water index [MNDWI] Modified Normalized difference water index is an improvement over NDWI which tracks changes related to water content of the water bodies. With MNDWI, aspects that are often associated with open water are more effectively enhanced and built-up area features are diminished. Because of its advantage over NDWI in terms of lowering and eliminating built-up land noise, MNDWI is therefore more suited for advancing and retrieving water information for a water zone where the built-up land area is predominant (Xu, 2006 ). MNDWI ranges from +1 to −1.(9) M N D W I = G r e e n  −  S W I R   G r e e n  +  S W I R         Areas with no water bodies are indicated as negative value whereas positive values > 0.5 represent water bodies.  2.7 Bare soil index [BSI] Bare soil Index is a numerical measure to represent change in soil. Spectral bands red and shortwave infrared measure the mineral content of the soil, and its vegetation presence can be enhanced using the blue and near infrared spectral bands calculated using eq (7)  given by Chen et al. (2004)  and eq (8)  given by Diek et al. (2017) .Numerous remote sensing applications such as crop identification, soil mapping are possible with the usage of BSI. For Landsat 5 TM  (10) B S I = ( S W I R 1 + r e d  )   − ( N I R + B l u e  )    ( S W I R 1 + R e d  )  + ( N I R + B l u e  )         For Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS  (11) B S I = ( S W I R 2 + R  )   − ( N I R + B  )    ( S W I R 2 + R  )  + ( N I R + B  )          2.8 Identification of uhi pockets Numerous methods were already established for measuring the UHI effects from image based LST difference between urban and non-urban area (Tu et al., 2016 ;Wu et al., 2019 ). It is vital to study the surface temperature of rural area or non-urban area to estimate the intensity of UHI accurately. (Oke, 1995 ) stated UHI is the temperature difference between urban and rural area. The estimation of UHI effect were carried forward by the below expression (Ma et al., 2010 ) for this study. LST > µ + σ 2    this expression refers to UHI effect 0 < LST < µ + σ 2    this expression refers to non UHI effect or rural area µ and σ are the average and standard deviation of LST °C  2.9 UHI index To determine the UHI effect intensively UHI index is estimated.UHI ranges from 0 to 1. The UHI index is calculated by the below eq (9)  proposed by Yong et al. (2006) (12) U H I I N D E X = L S T i  − L S T m i n    L S T m a x   − L S T m i n          LSTi  =Pixel value in LST image, LSTMax = Maximum value of temperature range, LSTMin=Minimum value of temperature range  2.10 Estimation of utfvi and identification of suhi zones Thermal comfort indices are used to evaluate UHI effect. Among the several kinds of thermal comfort indices, Urban Thermal Field Variance (UTFVI) Index evaluates the effect based on each pixel identified within the urban area about the entire urban area of the city studied (Sobrino & Irakulis, 2020 ). UTFVI is calculated by using LST of the specific area and the intensity of the surface urban heat island (SUHI) is assessed. SUHI can be studied based on LST (Schrijvers et al., 2015 ). For analysing the UHI effect quantitatively these UHI effects are divided into six zones as per the values of UTFVI (Liu & Zhang, 2011 ). The intensity of UHI in Tiruchirappalli city is assessed by UTFVI which is computed by the equation given below (Guha et al., 2018 ).(13) U T F V I = T S  − T m e a n    T m e a n         Where UTFVI = Urban Thermal Field Variance Index TS  = Land Surface Temperature in ( °C) Tmean  = Mean of Land surface temperature ( °C) of the entire region The six ecological evaluation indices are arranged based on the UHI intensity of Tiruchirappalli study area. Zero in UTFVI values indicates UHI absence whereas an increase in UTFVI values indicates UHI presence and the range varies from excellent to worst (Zhang et al., 2006).   3 Results and analysis 3.1 Spatio-Temporal variation of lst and spectral indices NDVI, NDBI, MNDWI, bsi The Spatio-temporal variations of Land surface temperature of the city Tiruchirappalli were calculated for April, May, June months of 2001, 2011, 2021 from the Landsat TM and Landsat OLI and TIRS respectively. It is distinct from the figure that the average LST values range from 37.45°C – 26.41°C for the month 2021 and the average LST value range from 32.33°C – 20.14°C and 31.23°C – 19.74°C for the month 2011 and 2001 (Fig. 3  ). On an average in 2001 the maximum temperature were found in southern part and few in central part of the city whereas in 2011 maximum temperature were found in southern part and majorly extending towards central part of the city.In 2021,the high temperature have slightly decreased along the southeastern are of the city but have intensified in the central and north part of the city.The Overall result represents the spatio-temporal variation of the LST of April has increased by 6.22°C for the duration of the year from 2001 to 2021. The Boxplot with LST values for April, May, and June for Tiruchirappalli city is based on Landsat 5TM and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS which is extracted from the sample points using Arcmap Software. These Boxplots were used to analyse the statistical distribution and variability of the studied LST of the year 2001, 2011, and 2021 of April, May, and June. The line within the box represents the median. The bottom line indicates the lowest value which is the first quartile, and the top line indicates the highest value which is the third quartile. The dots indicate the outliners (Fig. 8 ). Further the values of NBDI have also increased subsequently witnessing major urban growth in the city.The maximum distribution of NBDI of three summer months are shown in (Fig. 4  ). The NDBI of the city ranges of −0.36–0.31,0.26–0.69, −0.21–0.70 of the year 2001,2011,2021 for the month April (Fig. 9 ). In the months May and June of 2021, the NDBI index value ranges are found to be −0.41 to 0.24 and −0.38 to 0.18 respectively.The CBD, northern, and south eastern areas of the city have high NDBI index value in the year 2021.The lowest values are found in the southern part of the city where most of the land areas are vegetation and agricultural lands.Based on NDBI indices it has been observed that NDBI value increases towards the central and western part of the city i.e. Singarathope, Pallakarai, Woraiyur and eastern part of the city pappakurichi kattur and southern part of city of Kumaramangalam. Fig. 10  Furthermore, the mean value of NDVI has slightly increased from 0.15 to 0.23,0.19 to 0.27,0.17 to 0.27 from 2001 to 2021 of April, May and June representing an increase in urban green of the city Tiruchirappalli (Table 2  ). The maximum distribution of NDVI for three summer months are shown in (Fig. 5  ). We further assessed the presence of bare soil for the three decadal years of the same months with maximum distribution shown in (Fig. 6  ) for the city.In April trend shows increase in bare soil presence from 2001 to 2021 whereas May and June trend shows the variability of bare soil condition indicating the changes in land cover or land use (Fig. 11 ). Similarly,MNDWI value for summer months shows presence of water bodies (Fig. 7  ) where April and May 2021 trends shows presence of water bodies with less variability whereas June suggests transitional state of water condition or alteration. in the landscape setting that affected the water bodies (Fig. 12      ).  3.2 Interrelationship among LST, NDVI, NDBI, MNDWI,BSI The entire study area of Tiruchirappalli was divided into grid size of 250 m x 250 m using Arcmap software for extracting the sample points. Similarly,(Zheng et al., 2014 ) used the method of analysing the correlation trend between LST and impervious surface and Land surface temperature and green surface by dividing the study area into 210mx210m grid. In this study grid size of 250 m x 250 m of 2375 sample points were extracted from the LST imagery and the same sample were applied for extracting the values of NDVI and NDBI to comprehend the pattern associated with LST, NDVI, NDBI,MNDWI,BSI for 2001, 2011, 2021 of April, May and June. It can be understood from the correlation (Fig. 13  ) for all three years of April, LST has the strongest negative correlation with NDVI of R² value 0.908 for the latest studied year and strongest positive correlation between LST and NDBI of R² value 0.813 for the year 2021 as compared to 2001 and 2011.Positive correlation was found between LST-NDBI for all three years of May and negative correlation between LST-NDVI (Fig. 14  ). Similarly, the month June shows a positive correlation between LST-NDBI with R² value as 0.3413 for the year 2021 as compared to 2001 and 2011 and negative correlation between LST-NDVI (Fig. 15  ). It proves that the infrastructure of the city is expanding quickly and transforming natural ground surfaces into impermeable built-up area. Conversion of vegetation cover and soil with concrete and asphalt surface has lower albedo which reduce the evapo-transpiration and soil moisture (Levermore & Cheung, 2012 ;Mathew et al., 2016 ;Gupta et al., 2020 ;Roy et al., 2020 ) Similarly, numerous studies have examined the relationship between LST and NDVI at various scale and they show a strong inverse correlation (Weng et al., 2004 ;Sharma & Joshi, 2015 ;Guha & Govil, 2020 ). Urban areas with vegetation cover have lower surface temperatures due to evapo-transpiration; reduced incident radiation from shadows cast on the ground, and reduced radiation from pervious surfaces near trees. Tiruchirappalli is experiencing high density of built-up area in central part and the outer rural areas of agricultural fileds, open grounds have also been replaced. Likewise, MNDWI shows weak positive correlation with LST for the study period where R² values for April are 0.018, 0.0291, 0.018, R² value for May are 0.053,0.299,0.001 and R² values for June month are 0.089,0.092,0.0002. Similarly, BSI shows negative and weak positive correlation with LST for the entire study period where R² values for April are 0.0842, 0.0675, 0.072, R² values for May are 0.016,0.032,0.078 and R² values for June are 0.079,0.0717,0.002 which proves that the heterogeneity of the land surfaces increased. A study conducted by (Guha & Govil, 2022 ;Roy et al.,2020) for the city Raipur and Bangladesh observed LST has positive correlation with NDBI and a negative correlation with MNDWI. (Naim & Kafy, 2021 ) also observed that vegetation, bare soil and water body have substantial negative correlation with the recorded LST. Howere, there is a substantial positive correlation found between LST and Built-up area. These results validate the outcome of the current study.  3.3 Mapping of UHS UHI pockets are mapped for 2001, 2011 and 2021 of April, May and June based on the temperature threshold value derived from Table 3  . UHI Pockets are highlighted based on the LST value that exceeded the threshold temperature values of 30.61°C, 31.84°C, 34.49°C for the years 2001, 2011, 2021 for the studied month April. Likewise,the UHI pockets for May and June were based upon the threshold temperature values of 25.65°C, 27.36°C, 33.15°C and 19.03°C, 21.49°C, 21.67°C for the studied years (Fig. 17 ). Based upon the value increase (Fig. 16  ) it is observed, there is a notable increase in the urban hotspots in 2021 of the city. In 2001 UHI pockets were found in the southern location of the city. Further, in 2011 UHI pockets were found in a few parts of north, central and major part extended towards southern location of the city. The identified hotspot were concentrated in the wards of 2,6,7 where the city is bifurcated on the north by two rivers namely River Cauvery and River Colerron which acts as a natural boundary. The wards 6,7 witnessed the presence of UHI pockets along the river belt of Cauvery due to the low level of water and decrease in vegetation. Other wards like 20,30,32,33,34,38,47,49,51,52,53,59 have number of commercial, residential and public and semi-public buildings. The presence of UHI pockets are also found in these wards of the central area of the city (Fig. 16 b). In 2021, the high temperature pockets have moderately decreased along the southeastern area of the city and have extended intensively in the central part of the city due to high density of residential, commercial, public and semi-public of educational and institutional (Fig. 16 c). A study done by using MOD11A2 LST product of 1000 m for city Tiruchirappalli reports the central area of the city experiences higher temperature during summer season. The study further concludes high resolution datasets are required for analysing the microclimate at finer scale.In June 2021 a gradual decrease in temperature threshold value were witnessed due to the low surface temperature (Fig. 17  ). The reduction of UHI pockets in the southeastern location of the city is associated with increase in urban green which might have reduced the thermal anomalies. (Kotharkar & Bagade, 2018 ) reported from the study of Nagpur city that the temperature decreases with the increase of vegetation. A similar study done by (Sharma et al., 2021 ) for the city Noida also describes an increase in urban green has lowered the temperature and has contributed to decline in UHI pockets.  3.4 Ward wise analysis of changing scenario of uhi effect UHI index is calculated by the (Eq (12) ) for the study period of 2001, 2011, 2021 of three summer months. To analyse the changing scenario of UHI effect of the city the study area is superimposed with the ward boundary. The city Tiruchirappalli consists of 65 wards. In 2011, the southeastern location of the city with ward number 61, 64, 65 and few parts of northern part along the river Cauvery and ward 36 contributes to maximum UHI index (Fig. 18  b). However, in 2021, it is observed southeastern location of the city with ward numbers 61, 64, 65 has witnessed a slight decrease but UHI intensity has expanded intensively at the central area of the city. These identified pockets are concentrated in the wards 13, 14, 19, 20, 29, 30, 51, 52 (Fig. 18 c).Further, UHI intensity has found in few areas of the ward 41 and 42 of eastern location of the city and ward 52, 62 has found land use change of open or agricultural area into integrated transport hub and mining activity.On an average,UHI intensity has been found in the wards of 1,8,16,25,26,35,37 during 2001 and 2011.In 2021 the UHI intensity has intensified in the central area of the city of ward 13,20,30 (Fig. 18 a,b,c).  3.5 Estimation of surface UHI intensity using utfvi in tiruchirappalli city The UHI effect of Tiruchirappalli is quantitatively analysed by using Urban Thermal field Variance Index (UTFVI). According to 6 different ecological evaluation indices, UTFVI is classified into 6 classes. In order to interpret the surface UHI intensity by using UTFVI the study area is superimposed with ward boundary. The City Tiruchirappalli experiences two extreme categories: wards with good category of optimum thermal conditions with UTFVI values 〈 0.000 and wards with worst category of increased temperature, heat stress with UTFVI values 〉 0.020. Between the years 2001, 2011, and 2021 of three summer months there is an overall increase in thermal discomfort or environmental quality degradation in the city, resulting in existence of UHI phenomena (Fig. 19  ). In 2001, the northern location of the city ward 1,6, north-western of the city of ward 8,25 the north-eastern area of the city of ward 35,37 experiences excellent class of ecological evaluation class of 20.9 sqkm and southern part of the city of ward 56,62,65 experiences the category ranges from excellent class to worst of ecological evaluation Index (Fig. 19 a). Subsequently in 2011, the area under two classes excellent and good significantly decreased to 4.61 sqkm and 25.61 sqkm from 20.9 sqkm and 29.79 sqkm of 2001. The worse category of 34.29 sqkm and worst category of 13.30 sqkm of Ecological evaluation Index cover shows the presence of UHI (Table 4  ). In 2021, the ward 2,6 in the northern part of the city, ward 8,10 in the northwestern, ward 17,19,20,30 in the central part, ward 38,40,41,42,46,56,62,63,65 signifies the presence of UHI from strong to strongest of total area Sqkm(Fig. 19 c,Fig. 23 ).Compared to 2011,in 2021 the presence of UHI has increased to 12.9% of area from 8.05%. Few of the areas in ward 58,59,60,65 in the northeastern location of the city falls under the category of bad to normal because of slight increase in urban green. The changes of land use from open or agricultural area into built-up and the constituting high density of built-up of residential, commercial are the main contributing factors for the decrease of better thermal conditions of the city. In May 2001, the city exhibited an excellent ecological evaluation index covering an area of 17.15 square kilometer.Subsequently, by May 2011, there was an observed increase in the extent of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, indicated by 31.71 square kilometers classified under the worse category and 16.83 square kilometer under the worst category of the ecological evaluation index.In May 2021,an increase in UHI effect indicated by 19.46% of area and 10.45% classified under worse category of the ecological evaluation index (Table 4 ). However, during the years of 2001,2011,2021 of June there is an overall decrease in the surface temperature of city.Between the months of April, May, June of 2001 2011, 2021 an overall increase in surface temperature of the city is observed during April and May where June experience decrease in surface temperature (Figs. 20–22     ).   4 Discussions This study used Landsat images to retrieve the spatial distribution of LST in Tiruchirappalli city. The interrelationship between LST and NDBI, NDVI, MNDWI, BSI was explored. Further, the UHI index along with urban thermal field variance Index were analysed to understand surface UHI intensity. The results highlights the spatio-temporal of LST for the month April and May has been increased by 6.22°C and 6.18°C between the study period.The strong positive correlation between Land surface temperature and NDBI has been represented in the scatter plot shown in Figs. 13–15  which reveals urban growth of the city. Due to the increasing pressure of land the central loaction of the city is converted into impervious surfaces. The interrelationship between NDVI shows negative correlation and significant weak correlation were found between LST-MNDWI and LST-BSI. Further slight increase in urban green were identified in the southern part of the city along the River Cauvery belt. Major hotspots were noticed over the central location of the city due to its high density of residential and commercial building use. In the identified hotspots, the LST remains higher during the year 2021 of the three summer months.However,during the study period of June 2001 to 2021 gradual decrease in threshold temperature values was observed. According to UTFVI, the UHI effect was stronger with 13.14% in April 2001,20.69% in April 2011 and 28.95% in April 2021 with worse ecological evaluation Index. Similarly, UHI effect was stronger with 18.12% in May 2001,19.15% in May 2011 and 19.46% in May 2021 whereas June month resulted with 11.68% in 2001,9.33% in 2011 and 3.97% in 2021 with very less UHI effect. The wards of Trichy mainly 13,14,19,20,29,30,41,42,51,52,62 contribute to intense UHI effects.Similar like metropolitan cities many tier II growing cities are facing adverse effects of climate change. Considering the context of microclimate change and to manage the heat loads of the city there is a need to further investigate the urban indicators in the identified wards of UHI zones. Also, further attempt to explore the parameters such as building height, road width, building orientation, plot coverage and human occupancy would help in understanding the mitigation strategies at local scale (Li et al., 2018 ). This study methodology presents the interrelationship between LST and urban growth of the city Tiruchirappalli with spectral indices of NDVI, NDBI, MNDWI, BSI and UTFVI superimposed with administrative ward boundaries of the city. The thermal bands in Landsat images provide an understanding analysis of UHI change and such studies will answer the questions of why we have hotspots in the city and how to mitigate them. Such analysis will provide urban planning guidelines and solutions to decrease the heat stress in the city. In future, the study can be further extended by evaluating the local climate zones (LCZ) of Tiruchirappalli that will help in investigating UHI at local and micro level studies.  5 Conclusions Climate change has created a negative impact on human health, degraded environmental quality and resulted in excessive energy consumption. In comparison with the surrounding areas, the urban centres are concrete jungles with high temperature. Currently scientific studies on UHI studies gathered attention due to urban climate change at global scale and local scale. Tiruchirappalli is one of the major regional transportation hubs also known for its industrial centre establishment. The city has evolved in a radial form where the older city forms the central part along with the main corridor connectivity. The central part of the city has commercial, administration and residential land use with high density and narrow streets of unplanned development. The current study was to analyse the LST values for the three summer months of the years 2001,2011 and 2021 of April,May and June and its interrelationship with the spectral indices. A statistical tool was applied to comprehend the interrelationship with the indices. Tiruchirapalli city has witnessed notable growth over 20 years with pattern of NDBI and NDVI. The study shows good agreement between LST-NDBI (R² =0.8131 April 2021, R² = 0.2065 May 2021, R² = 0.3413 June 2021). A strong positive correlation is significant between LST-NDBI which shows the impact of urban expansion of the city particularly in the CBD area of the city.It is also noted that LST-NDVI reveals a strong negative correlation (R² =0.9084 April 2021, R² = 0.2781 May 2021, R² = 0.1874 June 2021) is the chance due to the increase in urban green of the city. The study also found a weak correlation between LST-MNDWI (R² =0.0186 April 2021, R² = 0.0533 May 2021, R² = 0.0898 June 2021) which indicates the seasonal changes in water bodies. A weak correlation is found between LST-BSI (R² =0.0842 April 2021, R² = 0.0161 May 2021, R² = 0.0797 June 2021) which may be due to the changes in landuse practices,soil moisture levels and seasonal vegetation growth. The identification of urban hotspots in Trichy through the analysis of average Land Surface Temperature (LST) data for the 2021 revealed consistent thermal anomalies. Notably, wards 1, 2, 19, 20, and 30 exhibited persistently elevated LST values, indicating these areas as constant hotspots.Further,the average UHI intensity above 0.7 were found in the wards of 1,3,20,30 during 2011 and 2021.Similarly the average UTFVI >0.020 were also found in the wards of 2,19,20,30 of 2011 and 2021.This consistent thermal anomaly suggests localized factors contributing to higher surface temperatures in these areas, necessitating further investigation to identify underlying causes and potential mitigation strategies. This study represents the major significant portion of variables such as LST, NDBI, NDVI, MNDWI and BSI which will be useful to study UHI effect when applied to any cities. Primarily, NDVI, NDBI, MNDWI can help in predicting the UHI effect which can be further used to mitigate the Urban Heat Island phenomena. In order to understand the factors contributing to UHI effects green, blue and grey infrastructure plays a crucial role in understanding the phenomena and to draw mitigation strategies.Further studies can also analyse and focus on socio-economic levels, Local climate zone, material properties, wind pattern, anthropogenic heat to comprehend the UHI effect at various scales and draw conclusions to mitigate UHI at city level but acquiring data from many cities would be challenging. The present study is based on satellite observations however field observations can be used to validate the estimated result for better assessment of city's environmental quality and potentially suggest ways to achieve SDG 11.
