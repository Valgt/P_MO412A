                  The accurate detection and monitoring of supraglacial lakes in high mountainous regions are crucial for understanding their dynamic nature and implications for environmental management and sustainable development goals. In this study, we propose a novel approach that integrates multisource data and machine learning techniques for supra-glacial lake detection in the Passu Batura glacier of the Hunza Basin, Pakistan. We extract pertinent features or parameters by leveraging multisource datasets such as radar backscatter intensity VH and VV parameters from Sentinel-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD) data, near-infrared (NIR), NDWI_green, NDWI_blue parameters from Sentinel-2 Multi-spectral Instrument (MSI) data, and surface slope, aspect, and elevation parameters from topographic data. The entire dataset is partitioned into training and testing sets, with machine learning models including the artificial neural network (ANN), the support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbour (KNN) trained on the training data (70%). Accuracy assessment employs testing data and involves the evaluation of metrics such as ROC curves and confusion matrices. The best-performing model, ANN, is validated against manually digitized lake polygons derived from Sentinel-2 and Google Earth Pro imagery. Furthermore, the digitized lake polygons are used to analyze glacial lake dynamics from 2016 to 2022. Key findings of this research presented that the NDWI_green, Sigma0_VH, and elevation are the most significant predictors in detecting supra-glacial lakes. Among the various trained and evaluated models, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) achieved the highest performance (accuracy: 95%, AUC: 0.99) and accurately mapped supra-glacial lakes regardless of their small size. The findings have significant implications for understanding glacial lake behavior in the context of climate change and informing future research and monitoring efforts.

The accurate detection and monitoring of supraglacial lakes in high mountainous regions are crucial for understanding their dynamic nature and implications for environmental management and sustainable development goals. In this study, we propose a novel approach that integrates multisource data and machine learning techniques for supra-glacial lake detection in the Passu Batura glacier of the Hunza Basin, Pakistan. We extract pertinent features or parameters by leveraging multisource datasets such as radar backscatter intensity VH and VV parameters from Sentinel-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD) data, near-infrared (NIR), NDWI_green, NDWI_blue parameters from Sentinel-2 Multi-spectral Instrument (MSI) data, and surface slope, aspect, and elevation parameters from topographic data. The entire dataset is partitioned into training and testing sets, with machine learning models including the artificial neural network (ANN), the support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbour (KNN) trained on the training data (70%). Accuracy assessment employs testing data and involves the evaluation of metrics such as ROC curves and confusion matrices. The best-performing model, ANN, is validated against manually digitized lake polygons derived from Sentinel-2 and Google Earth Pro imagery. Furthermore, the digitized lake polygons are used to analyze glacial lake dynamics from 2016 to 2022. Key findings of this research presented that the NDWI_green, Sigma0_VH, and elevation are the most significant predictors in detecting supra-glacial lakes. Among the various trained and evaluated models, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) achieved the highest performance (accuracy: 95%, AUC: 0.99) and accurately mapped supra-glacial lakes regardless of their small size. The findings have significant implications for understanding glacial lake behavior in the context of climate change and informing future research and monitoring efforts.

Supraglacial lakes or water bodies of meltwater that form on the surface of glaciers can significantly influence glacier dynamics and the hydrology of high mountainous regions (Bulley et al., 2013 ). Although supraglacial lakes are typically small water ponds less prone to catastrophic outburst floods than their larger, moraine-dammed counterparts, they nonetheless provide critical information about the impacts of climate change on glacier behavior and regional water resources (Murtaza and Romshoo, 2017 ). In recent decades, the accelerated melting of glaciers, driven by global warming, has led to the increased formation and expansion of supraglacial lakes (Ahmed et al., 2021 ). These lakes, while generally stable, can influence glacier mass balance internal hydrology and contribute to basal sliding when the water drains into crevasses (Mohanty et al., 2023 ). Understanding their dynamics is crucial for predicting glacier responses to climate change, managing water resources, and mitigating potential hazards in high mountainous regions (Chen et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2024 ). Detecting and monitoring glacial lakes in complex geographical settings and terrain, such as high mountainous regions, is challenging (Shrestha et al., 2017 ). Therefore, remote sensing data is warranted for gathering valuable and comprehensive information about these glacial lakes and any water bodies in mountainous regions. Research prior to ours used various remote sensing data and traditional techniques have been used to study glacial lakes (Xu et al., 2022, 2023 ). For instance, researchers manually delineated glacial lakes from multispectral or multi-polarization imageries, such as Landsat, and used true or false color composites and Sentinel-2 or Sentinel-1 (SzabÃ³ et al., 2016 ; Wangchuk et al., 2019 ). These methods typically yield more correct results, but they are time consuming when applying across a large study area. Other commonly used approaches include the semi-automated method using optical data. For example, Lu et al. (2011)  employed the Normalized Differentiate Water Index (NDWI) and Normalized Differentiate Vegetation Index (NDVI) combined with the slope and near-infrared (NIR) band. Similarly, Bolch et al. (2008)  and Shugar et al. (2020)  used modified normalized difference water index (NDWI), NDWI band combinations, and different NDWI thresholds for the Identification of potentially dangerous glacial lakes (Zhou et al., 2017 ). Acharya et al. (2018)  investigated different water indices to extract surface water by using Landsat-8 images to determine the efficiency of water indices NDWI, Modified Normalized Differentiate Water Indices (MNDWI), and NDVI. However, these semi-automated methods have several limitations with optical data generally for glacial lake mapping (Yin et al., 2023b,c) . These limitations include the cloud cover from optical images and cast shadows from mountains. Alternatively, the small size of supra-glacial lakes or ponds compared to large and visible water bodies are the primary challenges in both optical and SAR data (Wangchuk and Bolch, 2020 ). Therefore, mapping supra-glacial lakes in mountainous regions still needs improvement. Recently, significant advancements in green nanotechnology and advanced materials have shown promising applications in various environmental fields, including renewable energy production, environmental remediation, and sustainability. While these studies focus on broader applications, the technological innovations they discuss are integral for developing efficient and sustainable environmental monitoring systems. The integration of advanced materials and nanostructures, for instance, has greatly enhanced sensor capabilities and data accuracy. Moreover, other advanced technologies, including Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have increasingly been applied in various domains of environmental management, offering tools for data analysis, prediction, and decision-making that enhance our capacity to address complex ecological challenges (Noman et al., 2022 ). For example, ML algorithms have been successfully used for land cover classification, climate modeling, biodiversity monitoring, and pollution detection (Maxwell et al., 2018 ). Related to water resource management, ML techniques such as neural networks, support vector machines, and random forests have been employed to predict river flow, assess water quality, and model groundwater levels (Zhang et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2023 ). Khan et al. (2020)  also demonstrated the benefits of machine learning in glacier, snow, and ice mapping in high mountainous areas. Despite these advancements, several limitations constrain the full potential of ML and AI in sustainable environmental management. One significant challenge is the quality and availability of training data. Environmental datasets often face issues including missing values, noise, and limited temporal or spatial coverage, which can affect the performance and generalizability of ML models (Tufail et al., 2023 ). Furthermore, the complexity of environmental systems requires models that can capture non-linear interactions and adapt to dynamic changes, which is not always feasible with current ML techniques (Karpatne et al., 2017 ). Another critical limitation is the interpretability of ML models. Many advanced ML algorithms, such as deep learning models, function as âblack boxes,â providing limited insights into the underlying processes and relationships within the data (Zhou et al., 2023a) . This lack of transparency can hinder the acceptance and implementation of ML-driven solutions in environmental policy and management, where understanding causal mechanisms is essential for informed decision-making (Zhou et al., 2023d) . While ML and AI offer promising tools for enhancing environmental management, significant research gaps remain, particularly related to supraglacial lake detection and monitoring. Most existing studies have focused on larger-scale glacial lakes and their potential for outburst floods, leaving a gap in our understanding of the dynamics and impacts of smaller, more numerous supraglacial lakes (Zhou et al., 2023c) . Additionally, the application of ML techniques to multisource data integration in this field is still in nascent stages, with limited exploration of how different data types can be combined to improve detection accuracy and reliability (Maxwell et al., 2018 ). Therefore, this study evaluates the performance of various ML algorithms such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) (Zhou et al., 2023b) , Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Zhu and Blumberg, 2002 ), Logistic Regression (LR) (Meng et al., 2016 ), Random Forest (RF) (Jain and Phophalia, 2019 ), and K-nearest neighbour (KNN) approaches (Song et al., 2016 ). These algorithms were selected since they are less expensive and considerably improve our comprehension of the glacial lake extraction in the area. This study reveals a novel automatic technique for detecting supraglacial lakes on debris-covered glaciers by integrating high-resolution microwave and optical data with ML algorithms. The novelty of this study is several-fold, where we integrate multisource data, machine learning algorithms, and application to small supraglacial lakes. Regarding the integration of multisource data, previous studies only relied solely on either optical (Alifu et al., 2015 ; Rastner et al., 2014 ) or SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data (Yin et al., 2023a; Zhang et al., 2024) . Our research innovatively integrates high-resolution microwave (SAR) and optical data. This combination leverages the strengths of both data types, surpassing the limitations inherent in using them independently. Optical data are often challenged by cloud cover, while SAR data may struggle with detecting very small lakes (Shen et al., 2022 ). By integrating these data sources, our approach ensures more robust and accurate detection of supraglacial lakes. For machine learning algorithms, our study incorporates a diverse set of algorithms to leverage both advanced and classical techniques to enhance the robustness and accuracy of our supraglacial lake detection methodology. This methodological improvement allows us to effectively handle the complexities and variabilities in the data, such as different types of noise and the small size of many supraglacial lakes. The selected machine learning models are designed to optimize multisource data integration, which improves detection accuracy compared to traditional or semi-automated methods. Our study specifically focuses on the detection of small supraglacial lakes, or ponds on glaciers, which is new and has not been thoroughly explored, particularly in our region of interest. Previous studies in this area only specifically mapped the spatial distribution of supraglacial debris cover (Asfahani and Abou Zakhem, 2013 ) and the temporal dynamic changes of supraglacial debris Li et al. (2021)  using optical data. Our approach is the first to systematically apply both microwave and optical data with machine learning algorithms for small lake detection. This is a significant advancement, as small lakes are often more challenging to detect but key for understanding glacial melt and hydrology (Gardelle et al., 2013 ). Therefore, the study aims to develop a novel and fully automated method for extracting supraglacial lakes or ponds by integrating ML algorithms with high-resolution microwave and optical data. This study also aims to provide interannual spatiotemporal dynamics of supraglacial lakes of the Batura (Karakoram mountain) glacier in the Passu region. The implications of improved supraglacial lake detection using advancing technologies such as ML/AI extend beyond the scientific community. For environmental management, accurate monitoring of these lakes can inform water resource management strategies, particularly in regions where meltwater contributes significantly to downstream river systems (Feng et al., 2024 ). One objective of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) and Goal 13 (Climate Action), is to reliably track changes in glacial hydrology, supporting efforts to ensure sustainable water availability and developing adaptive measures against climate change impacts. Moreover, in high mountainous regions where communities often depend on glacier-fed water supplies, understanding the dynamics of supraglacial lakes can aid in disaster risk reduction. Although these lakes are less likely to cause outburst floods, their influence on glacier stability and meltwater production can indirectly affect the frequency and magnitude of other hydrological hazards (Wang et al., 2015 ). Hence, integrating multisource data and machine learning for supraglacial lake detection not only advances scientific knowledge but also contributes to the resilience and sustainability of vulnerable mountain communities (Harrison et al., 2018 ).  2 Study area The study was conducted in a significant Batura glacier Passu region in the Hunza River Basin, Pakistan, lying between 36Â° 54Ê¹ 7Êº N, 74Â° 65â 3â³ E with 2521â7749Â m (Fig. 1  ). According to the GLOF shape file, the total area of the study is 236.85Â km2 . The northern side of Pakistan is primarily mountainous terrain, including the high mountain ranges of Hindu Kush, Himalayas, and Karakoram (HKH). Many glaciers and lakes exist in these areas; however, more than 7,000 glaciers occur in the northern regions of Pakistan alone. The depletion of these glaciers is largely attributed to climate change, has enhanced creation of potential GL, with 3,044 such lakes formed in this region (Ashraf et al., 2017 ). The Batura glacier, which is 57Â km long and covers an area of 285Â km2 , is the fifth-longest glacier outside the Polar Regions. Near the PAK-China border, the Pamir, Tianshan, Karakoram, and Hindukush high mountains converge in the northernmost portion of the Upper Indus Basin (UIB), where the Hunza basin is located. The Batura Glacier is located in the centre of the Hunza Basin, which is susceptible to numerous hazardous glacial lakes and experiences destructive flooding in the downstream valley every year (Haseeb et al., 2024; Nasir et al., 2024; Tufail et al., 2024 ).  3 Materials and methods 3.1 Data collection In our line of work, the pivotal stage is the preparation and collection of remote sensing data for glacial lake observation using different techniques and tools. Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, SRTM-DEM, glacier, and lake boundary data were collected and analyzed for the study. 3.1.1 Sentinel-1 (SAR) data Recently, SAR data has been considered more robust, as it can penetrate through clouds, and data can be quickly recovered under cloudy conditions, unlike optical Sentinel-2. The ASF Data Search platform contains the Sentinel-1 SAR-Ground Range Detected data that was collected in the interferometry wide swath (IW) mode with dual polarization (VVÂ +Â VH). It concurrently transmits signals with vertical polarization and receives echo signals with both vertical and horizontal polarizations (VH and VV). We selected both VH and VV polarization based on the available frame for the study area and features of the various polarization modes. Per the range resolution, Sentinel-1's IW mode, which has a pixel-level resolution of 10Â m, can monitor lakes more precisely than other modes. Additionally, the 12-day time interval between Sentinel-1 satellites can be reduced to less than 6 days with the help of the Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B satellite networks. As a result, we mapped the distribution of supraglacial lakes in less than six days. In addition, to appropriately align the Sentinel-1(SAR) images with the Sentinel-2 images, they were geocoded and orthorectified using the SRTM-DEM. The SAR data's description and source are displayed in Table 1  .  3.1.2 Sentinel-2 multi-spectral instrument (MSI) Table 1  contains the description and source of MSI data. Cloud cover, solar elevation angle, and collecting data are all critical when choosing data in a cryospheric setting. Contrary to SAR data, the presence of cloud cover greatly influences visible range satellite data or optical data because it specifically affects the accuracy. As a result, using bitwise operations, we create a mask by filtering off cloud and cirrus pixels using the Quality Assessment band (QA60) in GEE. Thereafter, to reduce the amount of cloud and cirrus contamination, only clear scenes are kept for additional processing. Lastly, the generated mask is applied to the images, removing at the pixel level the impacts of clouds, clouds shadows, and terrain shadows.  3.1.3 Ancillary data The SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) version SRTM 1-Arc-Second Global (SRTMGL1) was used to define the study area (slope, aspect, and elevation). The data was acquired from USGS as a GeoTIFF image, and NASA JPL (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/tools/appeears/ ) provides this information at a resolution of 30Â m. The DEM resolution has been resampled to match the Sentinel-1 and 2 data spatial resolution. Therefore, the Nearest Neighbour (NN) resampling method was used for interpolating the DEM. The GLIMS website http://glims.colorado.edu/glacierdata/ provided the source of glacier outline data obtained from RGI version 6.0 with certain manual boundary corrections. Additionally, high-resolution images from Google Earth Pro and Sentinel-2 were incorporated to delineate lake boundaries from 2016 to 2022.   3.2 Methodology Fig. 2   presents the overall proposed study methodology. It consists of three core portions: data preprocessing, integrated image stack, and ML algorithms with accuracy assessment or validation. In addition to these three primary components, we also found the glacial lakes' annual dynamics using Sentinel-2 and Google Earth Pro images. Data pre-processing is an important phase in the data analysis process as it helps to ensure that the data is accurate, complete, and ready for analysis. We used SNAP to preprocess Sentinel-1 data. The preprocessing stages comprised the following: subset the study area, apply orbit file, remove thermal noise, remove border noise, perform radiometric calibration, apply range doppler terrain correction, re-project the calibrated radar image to Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection, apply a speckle filter, and finally convert the unitless backscattering coefficient to dB utilizing a logarithmic transformation. A detailed description of the above-mentioned Sentinel-1(SAR) preprocessing workflow is available (Workflow, 2019 ). Similarly, the MSI data was effectively preprocessed in GEE for glacial lake extraction. We first selected the desired data (2016â2022) and spectral bands (blue, green, and NIR, as they are suitable for the extraction of glacial lakes). Once selected, the data was pre-processed to remove noise using bitwise operations in GEE and cloud masking methods (Asfahani and Abou Zakhem, 2013; Ashraf et al., 2017 ). This procedure enhances data quality and renders it suitable for further analysis. The study area is then subset using a polygon to reduce the data size and focuses on the required area of interest. The preprocessed data was then exported for further analysis in SNAP. To calculate the NDWI, the blue (band-1), green (band-2), and near-infrared (NIR) (band-4) bands of MSI data were employed. We used a combination of two equations, namely equation (1)  for glacial lakes that predominantly reflect green light and equation (2)  for those that reflect high amounts of blue light.(1) N D W I  G r e e n   = ( G r e e n  â  N I R  )  ( G r e e n + N I R  )       (2) N D W I  B l u e   = ( B l u e  â  N I R  )  ( B l u e + N I R  )        By doing so, we effectively integrated the respective advantages of both indices for enhancing the appearance of high mountain glacial lakes in MSI imagery. 3.2.1 Integrated image stack After pre-processing the data, the most vital step is to merge the products or prepared intregated image stack (a combination of multi-source satellite images). We first goe-coded images to ensure the same coordinate reference system and accurately merged them. Subsequently, the geo-coding and preprocessing steps prepared our images to be merged in a stack as they have the same spatial resolution (10Â m), a similar spatial extent and are projected in the same coordinate reference system (UTM zone 43 North). Sentinel-1 is then used as the reference product for merging purposes, because, following range doppler terrain correction, has an extremely high accuracy is extremely high geolocation. Then, we employ the collocation operator and bilinear interpolation resampling approach, which requires one or more secondary products to be clipped and resampled appropriately, and one reference product that establishes the output product's extent, pixel size, and pixel registration. Finally, we produced an integrated image stack that includes radar backscattering (VH/VV), MSI, and topographic images (called input parameters), as shown in Fig. 3  . Similarly, Table 2   also demonstrates these input parameters, descriptions, and categories used for testing and training of ML algorithms in further analysis, represented by the numeric dataset (CSV. file). We used ten input parameters (radar backscattering band VH and VV, NDWI-blue, NDWI-green, NIR, blue, green, slope, aspect, and elevation to train supervised ML algorithms. Additionally, we capitalized on the NIR, blue, and green band images because they have low spectral reflectance for water bodies and high reflectance for vegetation. DEM was also used to compute the slopes of the glacier. The neighbourhood slope algorithm was used to compute the maximum rate of elevation change between a cell and its eight neighbouring cells (Wangchuk and Bolch, 2020 ) (also known as the average maximum technique), represented by equation (3) :(3) Î¸ = arctan ( Î a 2  + Î b  2    )  Ã 57.28      The slope in degrees (Î¸   ) was computed using the neighbourhood slope algorithm, with a change factor of 57.28 to convert from radians to degrees. This calculation accounted for the rate of elevation change in both the x    and y    directions (Î a    and Î b   , respectively). The calculated slope values range between 0 and 90, where values close to zero indicate flat surfaces and higher values indicate steep slopes.   3.3 Machine learning algorithms 3.3.1 Artificial neural network (ANN) The ANN is a vastly capable computational tool that can effectively tackle intricate nonlinear problems. This quality makes it a desirable option for a diverse range of fields, including modelling water temperatures (Graf et al., 2019 ), water quality prediction (Luo et al., 2019 ), climate change impact on streamflow in the lakes, and lake water level fluctuation (Zhu et al., 2020 ). We employed a feed-forward Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a type of ANN consisting of interconnected neurons organized in input, hidden, and output layers. The computational process occurs within the hidden layers, which are not directly observable. Each layer comprises neurons with activation functions and thresholds needed for training. The Adam optimization method is applied to adjust the network's weights, controlling inter-neuron connections. The mathematical representation of MLP equation (4)  is:(4) Ycm = â k  VchXc + Vm     where Y    denotes the output of nodes, k is located for all preceding layers, and Vch    is determined by the weights connecting the linking nodes h    and c    and the bias (Vm   ) of the node m, and the input (Xc   ) of the hidden layer. In this study, the activation function utilized in the hidden layers is the ârealâ activation function, which is defined by equation (5) :(5) P ( x )  = Max ( 0 , x  )  = f ( x )  = { x i  i f  x i  > 0    0 , i f x i  <  0           This function introduces non-linearity to the neural network's hidden layers and helps the network learn complex patterns in the data.  3.3.2 Random forest (RF) The RF is a supervised ML method employing ensemble learning by constructing multiple decision trees. These trees are built using different subsets of training data and features, a process known as bagging (bootstrap aggregating), reducing overfitting and enhancing generalization. A detailed description of RF is available (Khan et al., 2020 ; Onojeghuo et al., 2018 ). In this study, the three most important used hyperparameters of RF include: (1) the number of features that are suitable for division (mtry_5), (2) the (seed_1230) to ensure reproducibility of the random forest and the (nodesize_14) is used to control the depth of each decision tree in the forest, and (3) The number of bootstrap samples or decision trees to be grown in the forest (ntree_500).  3.3.3 K-Nearest neighbours (KNN) For classification and regression applications, KNN is a straightforward and effective machine learning technique. For predictions, it compares new data points with their k-nearest neighbours in the training dataset. The number of neighbours considered, denoted by the parameter k, affects the prediction process. This study employed the KNN method to predict supra-glacial lakes. The âk" in KNN represents the number of closest neighbours that act significantly in the voting process and determines the voting system in KNN, where neighbours with the shortest distance are chosen, and the KNN is calculated using equation (6) :(6) k ( y â  , y  )  = â i = 1  p  ( y â  â y  )  2         The expression y â     refers to the set of parameters for a new data point, while y    refers to the parameters for a single training data point. The letter i    represents the total number of parameters that are used to make a classification.  3.3.4 Logistic regression (LR) The LR is a statistical model that uses input variables to predict categorical and binary outcomes. To accurately model outcomes, it uses the sigmoid function to convert predictions into probabilities (Dreiseitl and Ohno-Machado, 2002 ; Vansarochana and Sharma, 2022 ). For predicting glacial lakes, we used logistic regression to analyze the likelihood of whether or not a certain area of glacier is likely to contain a glacial lake, considering the three classes. The dataset was split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function. LR was implemented with parameters penaltyÂ =Â 'l2â², CÂ =Â 10, multi_classÂ =Â 'multinomialâ, solverÂ =Â 'lbfgs', and max_iterÂ =Â 100. The model was trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set for prediction accuracy.  3.3.5 Support vector machine (SVM) Applying statistical learning theory without assuming data distribution, SVM is a strong classification technique. Great accuracy under challenging datasets is a well-known attribute of this non-parametric supervised learning classifier. The SVM assigns higher dimensional spaces to the data for classification by using kernel functions (Onojeghuo et al., 2018 ). It can be expanded to multiclass classification using techniques like one-against-one or one-against-all. In our study, the RBF kernel, one of the commonly used kernel functions, is employed for its efficiency and simplicity. The overall SVM details can be found elsewhere (Ahmed et al., 2021 ).  3.3.6 Accuracy assessment and validation In machine learning, accuracy evaluation is essential to comprehending model predictions. Models based on the study's findings are evaluated using a variety of measures, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. During the testing phase, the predictive model's performance was evaluated using confusion matrices. The algorithm's performance was also assessed using the ROC of AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic of Area under the Curve). These different measures were chosen for this research because they deal with classification analysis (Alifu et al., 2015 ). Moreover, the works of Navale and Haldar (2019)  and Triguero and Vens (2016)  provide a thorough explanation of precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, and their importance in assessing model performance. equations 7â10  used to calculate the precision, recall, and f-1 score metrics for each model is as follows:(7) Rate  of  Accuracy = [ TP + TN  ]    [ TP + FP + TN + FN  ]       (8) Rate  of  Precision = [ TP ]    [ TP + FP  ]         (9) Rate  of  Recall = [ TP ]  [ TP + FN  ]         (10) Rate  of  F 1  Score = 2 Ã [ Precission Ã Recall  ]  [ Precission + Recall  ]        In our classification context, TP denotes the accurate prediction of glacial lakes, whereas TN denotes the accurate prediction of non-lake materials (such as snow/ice or debris). The FP indicates misclassification of non-lake elements as glacial lakes, and FN indicates misclassification of glacial lakes as non-lake elements (ice/snow or debris). In addition to the standard machine learning evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, we further validated our predictive model's performance with Google Earth Pro images. To validate the results, we manually identified lakes in the images and correlated them with the lakes predicted by our models. By adding this validation phase, we ensure a more thorough evaluation of our model's performance in recognizing glacial lakes and differentiating them from other forms of land cover, including snow/ice or debris.   3.4 Supra-glacial lakes mapping This study also provides the interannual dynamics of supra-glacial lakes with machine learning and multi-source data. The Sentinel-2 and Google Earth Pro data were first used to identify lakes. Thereafter, all lakes were preliminarily classified into three categories: newly formed, survived, and drained, which required a manual inspection to verify. The uncertainties associated with lake mapping could be minimized with this labor- and time-intensive procedure, ensuring high-quality control. The lake contours were then confirmed, and more data was gathered. Vector files of the generated lake boundaries were then converted to KML format, compatible with Google Earth Pro. However, it was not able to accurately describe of the accuracy of glacial lakes because of the impracticality of conducting ground-based measurements. Then, following Duan et al. (2020) , the error in the area equation (11)  was determined by accounting for the interference of mixed pixels at the lake boundaries and calculating the lake outline uncertainty based onÂ Â±Â 1 pixel (10Â m for the Sentinel images).(11) u a = Î»   2  p  Î»   2  + Î»   2     = Î» p   2       where p is the perimeter of the glacial lake, Î» is the pixel resolution of the image, and ua is the area uncertainty of a glacial lake.   4 Results 4.1 Significance of supraglacial lakes detection parameters To assess the significance of different input features for supraglacial lake extraction, a Random Forest (RF) algorithm was used because it provides an inherent and straightforward mechanism to calculate and interpret the significance of each feature, and offers intuitive importance scores that are easily interpreted compared to ANN, SVM, KNN and LR. Importance scores were computed based on the decrease in the Gini index across the decision trees within the RF ensemble in Colaboratory. Fig. 4   illustrates the relative importance of these main input features. NDWI-green emerges as the most influential feature, followed closely by NIR and NDWI-blue. Radar backscatter intensity (Sigma0 VH), (Sigma0 VV) and elevation also contribute significantly to the classification of supra-glacial lakes. The prominence of NDWI-green, NIR, and NDWI-blue underscores the importance of spectral water indices in discriminating between water bodies and surrounding terrain. These indices are sensitive to water content, facilitating the identification of supra-glacial lakes based on their distinct spectral signatures. Additionally, the inclusion of radar backscatter intensity (Sigma0 VH) highlights the complementary nature of SAR data, providing valuable information on surface roughness and water presence. Elevation serves as a critical topographic feature, aiding in delineating lake locations based on altitude variations. While aspect and slope were less prominent in this analysis, they still contribute to the overall classification process by capturing terrain morphology and orientation. Comparatively, previous studies have also highlighted the effectiveness of spectral indices in water body detection. For example, (Zhou et al., 2017 ) found that NDWI and NIR were critical in identifying water bodies in the Poyang Lake Basin, China, and glacial lakes in High Mountain Asia which aligning closely with our findings on the importance of NDWI-green and NIR. Similarly, (Shen et al., 2022 ) demonstrated the value of SAR data, particularly Sigma0 VH and Sigma0 VV, in enhancing water body classification in various regions. Our results reinforce these findings, further validating the synergistic role of optical and radar data in supraglacial lake detection. Another important finding of ours was the role of elevation (Srivastava et al., 2013 ), where previous results emphasized the significance of topographic features in mapping high-altitude lakes. Although aspect and slope were less influential in our study, they still contribute valuable information, consistent with the observations by Salerno et al. (2012) , who noted that terrain morphology aids in refining classification boundaries. Hence, our feature importance analysis underscores the synergistic role of multi-source remote sensing data, encompassing optical and radar modalities and terrain information, in supraglacial lake extraction. This aligns with and extends previous research, highlighting the robust framework provided by the Random Forest algorithm for integrating diverse data sources to improve the accuracy of supraglacial lake detection.  4.2 Experimental results of machine learning algorithms To determine how effective our algorithms were in identifying debris, supra-glacial lakes and snow/ice, we assessed a range of metrics, including overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for each algorithm. We manually picked training samples for each class because supervised algorithms require labelled data for training, and then we utilized a grid search technique to find the optimal classifier parameters. With these optimal parameters in place, we trained our models and then classified the test data based on their respective classes. We emphasize that supervised machine learning methods have numerous parameters, so the grid search technique allowed us to pinpoint the most effective ones for our model. 4.2.1 Selection of training samples Training samples for supervised classification algorithms must come from all potential classes. Therefore, we collected training samples for the three class types, namely âdebris,â âsupra-glacial lakes,â and âsnow/ice.â We selected a region of interest that contains all classes and collected a total of 175,062 pixels. The generated dataset was then divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets. The total number of pixels used for testing and training was 52,519 and 122,543, respectively. Moreover, to prevent bias towards any particular class, the stratified sampling technique was used to select training samples that were geographically dispersed across the entire AOI and included depictions from each class with equal percentages.  4.2.2 Classification After finding the optimal classifier parameters and training the models, classifiers were applied to the test data for the extraction of supra-glacial lakes from the other two classes. Each algorithm assigned class labels to the pixels, accurately delineating lakes from debris and snow/ice areas. However, the unclassified pixels were assigned to the background class. Fig. 5   visually demonstrates the obtained classification results of each algorithm with high accuracy. Based on accuracy rates and training and testing times, we assessed the performance of various ML models for the extraction of supra-glacial lakes. Table 3   provides a comparative examination of each model's output. Among the models tested, the ANN demonstrated the highest accuracy rate of 95.10%, closely followed by the SVM with 94.78%, then Logistic Regression having 93.97%, and KNN and RF achieved accuracy rates of 94.31% and 91.80%, respectively. Comparatively, similar studies have shown varying performances of these algorithms. For instance, (Thanh Noi and Kappas, 2017 ) reported that SVM outperformed KNN and RF in land use/cover classification within the Red River Delta of Vietnam, with overall accuracy (OA) ranging from 90% to 95%, respectively. Conversely, a study by Khan et al. (2020)  found that ANN achieved superior accuracy over SVM and FR for mapping debris-covered glaciers in the Hunza Basin, aligning with our findings where ANN had the highest accuracy rate. Among the models, Random Forest had the most rapid training and testing timeframes in terms of computational efficiency. It did, however, come with some reduced accuracy rate compared to ANN and SVM. While KNN showed noticeably longer training and testing times than other models, Logistic Regression was efficient for training. Compared to SVM and Logistic Regression, ANN demonstrated a longer testing time despite attaining the highest accuracy. For this reason, the study used more than one hidden layer, as adding additional hidden layers can increase the model's capacity to learn complex patterns. Notably, utilizing more than one hidden layer resulted in enhanced accuracy of the ANN model, although it required greater testing or training time (Omondiagbe et al., 2019 ).   4.3 Accuracy assessment of classification results The accuracy assessment of classification results (Table 4  ), offers a thorough analysis of the different machine learning models' performance. These findings offer a thorough assessment of the precision, recall, and F1-score of every model for every class. Notably, strong classification performance is indicated by the SVM and ANN models, which consistently show high precision and recall for all classes. In contrast, RF and KNN models have comparatively lower recall scores for specific classes, indicating possible difficulties in accurately recognizing instances of such classes. Furthermore, the confusion matrices for each of the five machine learning models (Fig. 6  ), and offer a visual representation of the classification performance across various classes. 4.3.1 In-depth algorithm assessment and validation of supra-glacial lakes An Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC-ROC) analysis was conducted to evaluate the performance of the five machine learning models, specifically in distinguishing the supra-glacial lake class (Fig. 7  ). These results demonstrate the exceptional discriminative ability of all models in correctly classifying the lakes. The ANN, SVM, and KNN models achieved remarkably high AUC-ROC rates, indicating their robustness in distinguishing the supra-glacial lakes class from other classes. The Logistic Regression model also performed well, closely following the top-performing models. However, the RF algorithms showed a slightly lower AUC-ROC rate, suggesting relatively lower discriminative performance in extracting lakes compared to the other algorithms. Overall, the AUC-ROC analysis highlights the effectiveness of the machine learning algorithms, particularly the ANN, SVM, and KNN, in accurately identifying supra-glacial lakes, which is vital for automated detection in remote sensing applications. Following our evaluation of the discriminative performance of each algorithm, we observed that the ANN exhibited the highest level of performance in overall analysis. Therefore, we use ANN prediction for further validation purposes rather than considering all algorithms. This validation entails comparing the classification output of the ANN algorithm with manually delineated lakes from high-resolution Google Earth Pro and Sentinel-2 images. This comparison allows for a comprehensive assessment of the ANN's accuracy in identifying supra-glacial lakes. By overlaying the delineated lakes from Google Earth Pro images onto the ANN classified lakes and visually inspecting the agreement with manual delineation (see Fig. 8  ), we gain insights into the performance of the algorithm in real-world scenarios. The comparison revealed that the lakes identified by the ANN closely matched the manually digitized lakes, showing similar locations and extent. This suggests that the ANN algorithm accurately extracted supra-glacial lakes from other glacier-covered types.   4.4 Supra-glacial lake variation 4.4.1 Lake changes by area and elevation Supra-glacial lakes of the Batura glacier revealed significant numerical and areal changes from 2016 to 2022. These lakes can be categorized by area into three classes: large (lake area >0.03Â km2 ), small (lake area 0.03Â km2 -0.01Â km2 ), and very small (<0.01Â km2 ). Nearly most of the supra-glacial lakes in this area ranged from small and very small (â¤0.03Â km2 ). Small lake variations were more complicated, but we ably computed the change rates for the size of lakes over the study period. This computation produced both positive and negative change rates, indicating periods of expansion and reduction in the total lake area and the number of lakes per year. A positive change signifies an increase in the total lake area and the number of lakes annually, which can result from the survival of existing lakes or the formation of new ones. Conversely, a negative change indicates a decrease in the overall lake area and the number of lakes per year. Our analysis involved comparing each year with the previous one to understand annual rates of change. Then, the total positive change observed from 2016 to 2022 is approximately 0.2813Â Â±Â 0.0004Â km2  (97.9%). In contrast, total negative change was observed at approximately 0.2164Â Â±Â 0.0002Â km2  (â75.28%) over the study period (Table 5  ). Hence, the overall total area change observed was approximately 0.0649Â Â±Â 0.0004Â km2  (22.58%). Remarkably, when comparing the total negative and positive change rates, the total number of lakes and area both increased over the study period. This trend indicates that despite periodic decreases, the overall trend shows growth and expansion in both the number of lakes and the total lake area (Fig. 9  ). This trend aligns with findings from other studies. For example, Duan et al. (2020)  reported an overall increase in the number and area of glacial lakes in the Himalayas, despite inter-annual fluctuations. Similarly, Wang et al. (2011)  found a significant increase in the number of glacial lakes in the Tibetan Plateau, although the increase in total lake area was modest. Per our study region, the Batura glacier lies within the range of 7809â1418Â m a.s.l. (Fig. 1 ). Most of the supra-glacial lakes or ponds within the Batura glacier area are concentrated within elevational ranges of 3801â2637Â m a.s.l. This elevation band contains a higher density of lakes compared to other elevation zones within the glacier area. Over the study years, variations in the number and size of lakes within the 3801â2637Â m a.s.l. elevation range was observed (Fig. 9 ). These variations include fluctuations in lake area and potential number (increase/decrease), indicating dynamic processes within this elevation zone. This observation is consistent with the findings of Wendleder et al. (2021) , who observed a similar concentration of supra-glacial lakes within certain elevation bands in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and Karakoram region.  4.4.2 Newly formed, survived and drained lakes The natural supra-glacial lakes also warrants categorization into three classes: newly formed, survived, and drained lakes. In 2016, there were 99 supra-glacial lakes observed over the Batura glacier, of which 65 disappeared by 2017. In 2017, there were 82 newly-formed lakesand 34 survived lakes; total number of lakes present in 2017 was 116. Similarly, in 2022, there were a total of 103 lakes observed, of which 55 were newly formed, 48 were survived, and 49 lakes were entirely drained in 2022, despite existing in 2021. This indicates a dynamic landscape of supra-glacial lakes, with fluctuations in their formation, survival, and drainage. Fig. 10   provides a graphical representation of these trends, showcasing the distribution of new, survived (with areas either expanded or shrunk), and completely drained lakes. Given the predominance of smaller lakes, particularly notable in 2016 and 2022 images (Fig. 10 ), this visualization captures the intricate landscape of supra-glacial lakes within the study area. The maximum number of drained, survived, and new lakes over the study period were 96, 76, and 82 respectively. The overall trend of new survived and drained lakes for the entire period is provided (Fig. 11  ). This graphical representation reveals the fluctuating nature of supra-glacial lakes in the study area, with periods of fluctuations in abundance observed across the classes. This dynamic behavior of glacial lakes is consistent with (LeppÃ¤ranta et al., 2013 ), who observed significant inter-annual variability in the formation and drainage of glacial lakes in the Dronning Maud land and southeastern Tibetan Plateau.    5 Discussion 5.1 Supraglacial lake detection and variation Some key findings from our analysis include the significance of detection parameters (called input parameters or features from the multi-source datasets), experimental results of machine learning algorithms with accuracy assessment, and supraglacial lake variation. Our analysis included several input parameters or features to assess their importance in detecting supra-glacial lakes. Among these, NDWI-green, NIR, and NDWI-blue emerged as the most influential. The NDWI variants, particularly NDWI-green and NDWI-blue, leverage the reflectance properties of glacial lakes in the visible and near-infrared spectra to enhance water feature detection. The high importance of these parameters suggests that the spectral characteristics of water or lake are essential for accurate classification (Kloiber et al., 2002 ). The dominance of NDWI-green and NIR as key features for supra-glacial lake detection underscores the critical role of optical remote sensing data (Watson et al., 2018 ). NDWI indices, particularly NDWI-green, are highly effective in distinguishing supraglacial lakes as they are sensitive to the specific spectral properties of water, which absorbs near-infrared light while reflecting visible light (Wangchuk and Bolch, 2020 ). This enhances the contrast between water and other surface features such as ice and debris, enhancing the identification of lakes (Yan et al., 2020 ). Moreover, NIR (Near-Infrared) is also significant because of its sensitivity to water content, further supporting in distinguishing glacial lakes from other surface features. The significance of NIR highlights the value of near-infrared wavelengths in detecting water content (Pahlevan et al., 2019 ). These spectral parameters are fundamental in remote sensing applications, as they provide clear and reliable differentiation of water bodies from other landscape features (Bulley et al., 2013 ). Additionally, radar backscatter intensity Sigma0 VH and Sigma0 VV features from SAR data contributed significantly to our study of the classification and demonstrated the utility of multi-source remote sensing. Radar backscatter provides valuable information on surface roughness and moisture content, which complements optical data, particularly in cloudy or low-light conditions where optical sensors are less effective (Wu et al., 2020 ). Because SAR data is unaffected by cloud cover and can operate in all weather conditions, it provides additional information on surface roughness and moisture content (Shen et al., 2022 ; Tom et al., 2020 ). This enhances the robustness of the detection process, ensuring accurate classification even in challenging environmental conditions. Elevation parameters derived from digital elevation models also proved crucial, highlighting the role of topography in lake formation and persistence (Srivastava et al., 2013 ). We evaluated the performance of several machine learning algorithms, including ANN, SVM, RF, KNN, and LR, in classifying supra-glacial lakes. The ANN algorithm achieved the highest classification accuracy of 95.10%, indicating its superior capability in capturing complex patterns like small glacial lakes and relationships within the data. This was closely followed by SVM with an accuracy of 94.78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional feature spaces. Despite this, slightly lower accuracy of 91.80%, RF was noted for its computational efficiency, with faster training and testing times compared to other algorithms. This trade-off between accuracy and computational cost is important for practical applications where resources may be limited. Both KNN and LR also performed commendably, with accuracies of 94.31% and 93.97%, respectively, showcasing their utility in this context. Furthermore, to evaluate the reliability of our classifications, we performed a detailed accuracy assessment and validation using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score and manual digitization. Both SVM and ANN models demonstrated high precision and recall, indicating their robustness in correctly identifying supra-glacial lakes while minimizing false positives and false negatives. These models consistently achieved high F1 scores, reflecting a good balance between precision and recall. Alternatively, RF and KNN models exhibited lower recall scores for certain classes, suggesting potential difficulties in accurately recognizing some instances of supra-glacial lakes. This may be related to the inherent characteristics of these algorithms, which might not capture all the nuances of the data as effectively as ANN and SVM. Our temporal analysis from 2016 to 2022 revealed significant variations in the number and area of supra-glacial lakes on the Batura glacier. The total number of lakes and their cumulative area showed an overall increasing trend, indicative of glacier melt and changing climatic conditions. Annually, we observed both positive and negative change rates, reflecting periods of lake formation and expansion as well as reduction and drainage. Most of these lakes were concentrated within the elevation range of 3801â2637Â m above sea level (m a.s.l.). This specific elevation band appears to be particularly conducive to lake formation, possibly resulting from optimal temperature and pressure conditions that facilitate the melting and refreezing processes. This concentration underscores the importance of elevation as a factor in supra-glacial lake dynamics. The observed annual variations in the area and number of supra-glacial lakes reflect the dynamic and responsive nature of glacial environments to climatic and environmental changes (McMillan et al., 2007 ).  5.2 Comparison with previous studies Our findings align with those of Wang et al. (2011) , who also observed an increase in the number and area of glacial lakes in the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau, respectively. This consistency suggests that the trends observed on the Batura glacier may be part of a broader regional pattern of glacial lake dynamics driven by climatic changes. Specifically, the increase in the number and total area of glacial lakes is indicative of accelerated glacier melt, which is a response to rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns in these high-altitude regions. In addition, the significant inter-annual variability observed in our study is consistent with the findings of (Wangchuk et al., 2019 ), who reported similar dynamics in the Bhutan Himalaya. These fluctuations indicate that supra-glacial lakes are highly sensitive to short-term climatic variations and glacier dynamics, underscoring the need for continuous monitoring. The annual variations in lake area and number reflect the complex interplay between seasonal weather patterns, such as variations in snowfall and temperature, and the glacier's response to these changes. Moreover, the concentration of lakes within certain elevation bands corresponds with the observations of Wendleder et al. (2021)  in the Tibetan Plateau (TP), and Karakoram region. Several previous studies (Du et al., 2024; En-Nagre et al., 2024; Farhan et al., 2024; Triguero and Vens, 2016 ) have examined the use of ML algorithms in various fields. For glaciology, Xie et al. (2020)  explored temporal dynamic changes of supra-glacial debris, Khan et al. (2020)  specifically mapped the spatial distribution of supra-glacial debris cover, Prieur et al. (2022)  developed a method to detect glacier snow lines on multi-spectral satellite images and Sharda et al. (2022)  used hybrid machine learning technique for feature optimization in object-based classification of debris-covered glaciers. These studies demonstrated the benefits of machine learning in accurately detecting and classifying classes from remote sensing data. Similarly, our results align with these studies and highlight the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms, particularly ANN and SVM, in achieving robust accuracy rates for identifying supra-glacial lakes. The high accuracy rates achieved by ANN and SVM in our study are consistent with findings from other remote sensing studies. For example, Thanh Noi and Kappas (2017)  and Zhang et al. (2020)  found that SVM outperformed other classifiers in land cover and glacial lake classification tasks because they could model complex and nonlinear relationships in the data. Despite its slightly lower accuracy, the computational efficiency of RF is corroborated by Nazakat (2021) , who noted the algorithm's speed and robustness in handling large datasets with multiple features. However, some differences exist between our study and previous research. For instance, while Khan et al. (2020)  and Xie et al. (2020)  studies were conducted in the same area, they specifically mapped the spatial distribution of supra-glacial debris cover and the temporal dynamic changes of supra-glacial debris using optical data. Our study integrated both SAR and optical data to improve classification accuracy, specifically for extracting supra-glacial lakes or ponds on debris cover in the region. Additionally, while Sharda et al. (2022)  explored glacier mapping in different regions, our study specifically targeted the Batura glacier in the Hunza River Basin, Pakistan. These differences underscore the importance of considering regional variations and data integration techniques when applying machine learning algorithms for supra-glacial lake mapping. Generally, our study contributes to the growing evidence that supra-glacial lakes are expanding in response to climatic changes and that various machine-learning techniques can effectively detect and monitor these dynamic features. The observed trends and patterns are consistent with those reported in other glacial regions, suggesting that similar processes work across different environments. This comparison underscores the importance of using diverse remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms to gain a comprehensive understanding of glacial lake dynamics and their broader environmental implications.  5.3 Implications, limitations and future directions Results from our study have several important implications such as the effectiveness of using machine learning algorithms, particularly ANN and SVM, in extracting supra-glacial lakes highlights their potential for large-scale monitoring and mapping of glacial environments. These methods can be applied to other glacial regions to facilitate global assessments of supra-glacial lake dynamics. Similarly, for climate change monitoring, the observed increase in the number and area of supra-glacial lakes serves as an indicator of glacier melt and climate change impacts in high-altitude regions. Continuous monitoring can provide information of the effects of global warming on glacial dynamics, contributing to more accurate predictions of future changes. For water resource management, understanding the distribution and dynamics of supra-glacial lakes is valuable for managing water resources in glacier-fed river basins, particularly in regions dependent on glacial meltwater for their freshwater supply. Our findings can inform water resource management strategies to mitigate the impacts of changes in glacial meltwater availability. While this study provides important advancements, its limitations warrant further investigation. For example, we used a manual delineation method to verify findings in the study region. Although our study area is small and limited to one glacier, manual delineations are practical; however, at large scales, although our method will remain applicable, the associated validation technique will be time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, our study did not incorporate pertinent variables such as temperature and precipitation data, which are vital in glacier and glacial lake dynamics. Therefore, our findings could not confirm expectations of dynamic changes in supra-glacial lakes given glacier retreat and climate variability. Additionally, the dynamic nature of these lakes, even fluctuating monthly, needed to be fully captured in our analysis, which primarily focused on annual dynamics to streamline the methodology. Future research could explore monthly analysis and long-term trends (rather than the brief period 2016â2022) of supra-glacial lake dynamics, incorporating additional data such as glacier dynamics and climate variability. While our study demonstrated machine learning algorithms' high efficacy and accuracy in extracting small supra-glacial lakes, several avenues for future research remain. Small glacial lakes exhibit considerable variability in size, location, and occurrence, presenting challenges in their identification. An alternative to traditional machine learning approaches has emerged with developing the âZeoDepthâ deep learning model. Specifically designed for detecting tiny or deep objects without human-engineered features, this innovative approach offers promise for more accurate extraction of small lakes or ponds. Overall, this study demonstrated the utility of machine learning algorithms in detecting and analyzing supra-glacial lakes on the Batura glacier in Hunza Basin. The findings highlight the dynamic nature of supra-glacial lakes and their sensitivity to environmental changes. The observed trends of increasing numbers of lakes and areas provide important indicators of glacier health and climate change impacts. Future research should focus on expanding temporal coverage, incorporating additional data sources, and modern deep learning models to create a more comprehensive understanding of supra-glacial lake dynamics. By addressing the limitations and expanding the scope of research, we can improve our ability to monitor and manage glacial environments, contributing to more effective responses to the challenges posed by climate change. The integration of various AI techniques with multi-source remote sensing data represents a promising approach for enhancing our understanding of glacier dynamics and their implications for global water resources.   6 Conclusion This study provided an in-depth analysis of supra-glacial lake detection and variation on the Batura glacier by integrating ML algorithms with high-resolution microwave and optical data. We found that our automatic method improves the classification accuracy of supra-glacial lakes on debris cover by addressing challenges such as cloud cover in optical data and the small size of lakes in microwave data. These methods consist of integrating multi-source datasets and specific supervised machine-learning models. The (NIR) near-infrared reflectance images, NDWIgreen, NDWI blue, the radar backscattering intensity in the VH and VV bands, surface slope and aspect, and elevation were the primary input parameters or features. This technique was used to experiment with the Batura glacier, ranked as the fifth largest glacier outside the polar regions. The glacier spans an area of 285Â km2 , having a length of 57Â km. Further key findings and novel contributions of this research include:â¢ Spectral indices such as NDWI-green, NIR, and NDWI-blue emerged as the most influential input features for detecting supra-glacial lakes. These indices were critical in distinguishing water bodies from other surface types given their sensitivity to water content. Moreover, the inclusion of radar backscatter intensity (Sigma0 VH and VV) and elevation data significantly improved classification accuracy. This underscores the value of integrating multi-source data, such as optical and radar remote sensing data to capture diverse surface characteristics.  â¢ The ANN algorithm achieved the greatest classification accuracy (95.10%), followed closely by the SVM (94.78% accuracy). These results demonstrate the superior capability of these algorithms in handling complex pattern recognition tasks, including the small size of supraglacial lakes. Although the RF algorithm had slightly less accuracy (91.80%), it was the most computationally efficient, rendering it suitable for applications requiring quick processing.  â¢ The study provided a detailed comparison of five machine learning algorithms (ANN, SVM, RF, KNN, and Logistic Regression) based on overall accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC metrics. Our comprehensive evaluation provides insights into each model's strengths and weaknesses, guiding future algorithm selection for similar tasks.  â¢ This study also provided the annual changes of supraglacial lakes. From 2016 to 2022, the total number and area of supra-glacial lakes increased, with significant inter-annual variations observed. This dynamic behavior reflects the impact of environmental factors such as temperature and precipitation pattern fluctuations.  â¢ Most of supra-glacial lakes were concentrated within the elevation range of 3801â2637Â m a.s.l., indicating a potential relationship between elevation and lake formation. This finding aligns with previous studies that suggest specific elevation bands are more conducive to lake formation due to temperature and pressure variations.  â¢ The study quantified positive and negative change rates in lake area and number, providing a nuanced understanding of the expansion and reduction patterns over the study period. The net increase in both lake area and abundance indicates a trend towards growth and expansion. Moreover, classifying lakes into newly formed, survived, and drained categories revealed the dynamic nature of supra-glacial lake systems. The study observed fluctuations in these categories annually, highlighting the transient nature of these lakes.  â¢ This study has significant implications for climate change and water resource management. The increasing number and area of supra-glacial lakes indicate glacier melt and climate change impacts. Continuous monitoring of these lakes can provide valuable information into the effects of global warming on glacial dynamics. Furthermore, understanding the distribution and dynamics of supra-glacial lakes is essential for managing water resources in glacier-fed river basins. These lakes are significant meltwater sources, critical for downstream ecosystems and human populations.    This research offers a robust framework for the automated extraction and analysis of supra-glacial lakes using machine learning algorithms. The study's novel findings and methodologies significantly affect climate change research and water resource management. By addressing the limitations and expanding the scope of research, future studies can build on these findings to improve our understanding of glacial environments and their responses to climate change.
