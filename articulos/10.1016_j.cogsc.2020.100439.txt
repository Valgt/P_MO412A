                  The development of sustainable green technologies and processes becomes key to a sustainable society. Through sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations, the purpose is trying to achieve better human life under low carbon, circulation, and natural symbiosis societies. Concepts of green chemistry and sustainable green technologies for developing advanced materials are important, for example, the recycling processes of waste materials and bio-based industries. This review highlights the role of SDGs in material development and introduces examples for cases of recycling with plant wastes or uses of green chemicals for functionally advanced materials. Since such ways reduce the environmental load, the trends in recent surveys point to the views of SDGs for advanced materials and sustainable green technologies, as explained for industry, innovation, and infrastructure, especially for the 9 SDGs.

Through sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations, the purpose is trying to achieve better human life under low carbon, circulation, and natural symbiosis societies. Concepts of green chemistry and sustainable green technologies for developing advanced materials are important, for example, the recycling processes of waste materials and bio-based industries. This review highlights the role of SDGs in material development and introduces examples for cases of recycling with plant wastes or uses of green chemicals for functionally advanced materials. Since such ways reduce the environmental load, the trends in recent surveys point to the views of SDGs for advanced materials and sustainable green technologies, as explained for industry, innovation, and infrastructure, especially for the 9 SDGs.   Graphical abstract Image 1        For complete overview of the section, please refer the article collection - Green Processes and Technologies       Introduction The sustained development of human is important in symbiosis and circulation in world level cooperation. Since global environmental change is now decreasing the capacity of nation-states to fulfill their definitional functions without the cooperation of people, the current rate of resource use and consumption pattern are depleting the planet’s finite resources. Also, the added stress due to environmental change increases the demand for adaptive capacities of nation-states and furthermore diminishes their resources to fulfill other core functions. For those reasons, the United Nations Member States had developed sustainable development goals (SDGs) in 2015. The motto is ‘The Sustainable Development Goals are the blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all’ and has provided ‘The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’ [1 ]. People aim at the society that can realize the connection with nature and the person. For realizing this, there are 17 SDGs that are recognized for ending their poverty and deprivations [2 ,3 ]. For restricting the safe operating space and transgressing the planetary boundaries endangering the existence of human societies, it is important to note that sustainable chemistry is necessary in our human life [4 ]. In order to keep sustainability in our life, the concept containing a low-carbon society, circulation society, and natural symbiosis society teaches us a better way. To achieve this, the closeness of integrated improvement is necessary in conjunction with the environment, economy, and society (Figure 1  ). Here, the economic activities make closeness the low-carbon society for investment and consumption with building an economic social system as based on circulation for the symbiosis with nature. Those activities are also related to the production and the management of chemical substances in industries, which have strongly contributed to the regulation of pollution of the earth. In contrast, environment exercise can propose the way of the sustained chemical industry as a concept of green chemistry [5 ,6 ] that fuel the growth of the ecosystem [7 ]. This originated from the Ministry of the Environment of the United States of America, with the purpose to maintain minimum environmental load of the chemical substance and influences to sustain the ecosystem in all life cycles. There is another environmental policy of ‘sustainable chemistry’ that has been organized by Economic Co-operation and Development OECD proposed around Europe [8 ,9 ]. This is originated by the sustained industrial way that can grow up through exploitation of recycling and saving resources and can be supported the under chemical ecosystem. In the movement process for eco-society, people should consider symbiosis with nature and recognize both environment and economic societies [10 ] when industries produce products and develop technologies with relevant ecosystems. But, the decline of the resources and the acceleration of the energy consumption are leading to anxiety of the drying up of earth resources, therefore, meaning actual necessity on the development of the innovative materials and their technologies in order to reduce such environmental load [11 ]. In their guidance, the EPA6 recognizes five core elements of cleanup projects as follows: total energy use and renewable energy use, air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions, water use and impacts to water resources, materials management, waste reduction, and land management under ecosystem. People are now focused, for example, on environment preservation and saving technologies to reduce environmental load.  Concept of low carbon, circulation, and natural symbiosis For the construction of a sustainable society with low carbon, circulation, and natural symbiosis, it is necessary to effectively use biomass sources in the purification and recycling processes. The achievement is now promoted now by SDGs, which is effective, mainly for the model framework of the 9 and 12 SDGs. Figure 2   illustrates bio-industry and recycling wastes leaching to the development of advanced materials, and then the utilities become green and eco-technologies for better human life. For example, the 9 SDGs category can cover the whole processes that are related to the foundation of efforts to achieve environmental objectives. The innovative technologies can reach us to sustained increases in living standards for all people. This also provides us the technological solutions and the improvement way in our health and education as required infrastructure [12 ,13 ]. Due to the problems of pollution, resources and energy, green technology and the process are on the basis of categories 6, 13, and 14 for water pollutant treatment, categories 7, 13, and 15 for the bio-based product, biorefinery, and biofuel and then the SDGs 3 for medical materials and medicines, respectively. Actually, biomass materials, biorefinery, and relevant bio-industrial products are included. In order to promote and realize to the goals, academic impact of the education and research sector [14 ] supports developing such innovative materials and utilizing relevant technologies. In the academic hubs [13 ], for example, several SDGs technologies are progressing in waste product reuses [15 ], electric energy store [16 ], water pollutant preservation [17 ], biorefinery [18 ,19 ], and antiallergic materials [20 ] for better human life. In such a global trend, it is important to develop the technical elements in sustainable materials and processes, which are covered with low carbon, circulation society, and natural symbiosis. Especially in bio-based industries [21 ], the foundation of efforts can achieve new biorefining technologies to sustainably transform renewable natural resources into bio-based products, materials, and fuels in Europe by €3.7 billion investments in bio-based innovation from 2014 to 2020. In the following basic concept, green materials of biomass materials and plant base chemicals really become one of the important perspectives, when people incorporate them in green processes as advanced technology [4–7 ], since protecting the earth environment is necessary with developing the economy. From now on, by utilizing biomass sources and waste, people are planning symbiosis of environment conservation and development of the economy. In such material approach, one of the ways reviewed [22–24 ] is for building a sustainable society with low carbon, circulation, and coexistence with nature, as indicated in Figure 1 .  Biomass materials as sources for sustainability future In the above-mentioned situation, people have already recognized the importance of lingo-cellulosic residues from agriculture and forestry residues since they are abundant in the material resources [22 ,23 ]. The uses are strongly related to the challenging ways for solving serious environmental and energy problems in the 12 SDGs. More recently, biomass materials are one of the important sources because of containing a carbon-neutral issue. In addition, biomass materials are characteristic sources in every country, and therefore, the promotion of activities are attractive. For example, among all biomass sources, cellulose and chitin are the most diverse materials from plants and food wastes abundant in nature [24–26 ]. On the basis of the SDGs 12 and 15, the environmental measures are how people promote food waste reduction and recycling. At this time, there are innovative technologies of regenerative cellulose for advanced materials in medical [27 ,28 ], tissue regeneration [29 ,30 ], and medicines [31 ,32 ]. For instance, those materials regenerated from sugarcane bagasse and agave bagasse in food industries retain flexible and strong mechanical properties, although the materials have higher water retention in the hydrogel films (Figure 3  ) [25 ]. In industrial regenerating, such cellulose could be converted to the following advanced materials of carbon fibers [33 ], composites [34 ,], and biodegradable films [36 ,37 ]. In addition, the issue of recent microplastic pollution [38–40 ] accelerates the utilization and the spread of these biomass materials since the knowledge of ecological and health risks of microplastic pollution is surrounded by considerable uncertainty. Thus, biomass plastics are products made of good use of organicity resources [41–45 ] in the following advantages of (1) biomass sustainable resources, (2) carbon-neutral [41 ] and (3) catalytic degradation [46 ] and biodegradable decomposition without burning [36 ,37 ] for low carbon, circulation, and natural symbiosis.  Uses of plant-based chemicals for functional molecules On the basis of green chemistry, uses of plant-based chemicals are interesting in the innovative sector for energy saving and environmental conservation, since less approaching to such natural chemical is included with simple purification processes. From the viewpoints of SDGs, this is one of the pillars of a green-based society to an alternative based on natural resources. It is known that plant-based aldehydes are selected from herbaceous aldehydes, as seen in Table 1  . There are interesting chemicals for the plant-based aldehydes [47–63 ]. Among them, such chemical is derived from lignin for aldehyde monomers, for example, in syringaldehyde, vanillin, and p -hydroxybenzaldehyde, which can be obtained from plants of maple tree, vanilla seed, and gastrodia for syringaldehyde, vanillin, and p -hydroxybenzaldehyde, respectively. As those chemicals were used in simple condensation synthesis to calix [4 ]resorcinarene (inserted in Figure 2  for the chemical structures), the resultant functional molecules possessed ion-selective inclusion [64 ,65 ] and composites [66 ]. Those molecules have selective functionality to be used as analytical and separation tools.  Conclusion From the point of view of sustainable development goals, advanced materials provided from industry wastes and other green sources were highlighted by this review. In particular, biomass plants, including cellulose and the related chemicals, were introduced to advanced functional materials belonging to SDGs categories. At present, this is a clear aim of the future mark of people. It is noted in the 9 SDGs that those materials and included green processes are becoming concrete perspectives for progressing the development of industry, innovation, and infrastructure, and contributed to the construction of a sustainable society under low carbon, circulation, and natural symbiosis. As summarized in Figure 1 , green pathways are necessary for constructing a coexistence society with nature under the symbiosis of environment conservation and development of the economy for our future pathway.
