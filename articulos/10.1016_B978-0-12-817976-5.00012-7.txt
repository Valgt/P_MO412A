               The UN has called for a ‘data revolution’ to help overcome the low quality and lack of regularly updated statistical data available in developing countries. But how do we achieve this with limited financial resources and insufficient capacity in national statistical offices around the world? Recent studies have demonstrated how information captured by satellite imagery can be combined with social datasets to increase our understanding of socioeconomic systems. Thus, in the future, satellite data may offer a cost-effective way to reliably measure and monitor progress towards development goals. We examine how satellite data can be linked with household and census datasets to provide information on socioeconomic conditions. We suggest that the Sustainable Livelihoods Approach provides an appropriate framework for which to develop remotely sensed earth observation (EO) data proxies for key socioeconomic conditions because it will allow the linking of data in a way that reflects more the way in which populations interact with landscapes. The aim of using EO data for mapping and predicting socioeconomic conditions is not to replace survey data but to provide more frequent information on likely socioeconomic conditions between census and survey enumeration. Timely recalibration of models predicting poverty from EO data would be necessary to reflect often rapid social, economic and political changes. However, if we are to acheive the SDGs more frequent data at finer spatial scales will be required and EO data provides a cos effective solution.

Fig. 11.1 Some examples of proxies for sustainable livelihood assets that could be estimated from EO data. Assumptions may have to be made that all households have access to schools or health centres, however with the increasing amount of data available from open street map its possible to identify school types and therefore overtime more will be known about how selective schools are. NTFP = Non-timber forest products (Figure by Gary Watmough and Charlotte Marcinko 2020.)  Fig 111   Fig. 11.2 Demonstrating field ownership in and around a village (blue). The village boundary (black line) would be the extent of the analysis so anything within this polygon would be considered as part of the model to estimate poverty/wellbeing anything outside of the black line would be considered to belong to a different village or if not in a village boundary may be ignored. The fields with blue dots are owned by households belonging to village A but are outside of the boundary so these would be dropped from the analysis whilst fields inside the village boundary with orange dots are owned by households in neighboring villages but these would be linked to village A in the statistical models. (Figure by Gary Watmough 2020.)  Fig 112   Fig. 11.3 Socio-ecologically informed approach to linking EO data with socioeconomic data. Four households (A, B, C, D). Each derives direct sole benefit from some land parcels and other parcels can be used by multiple households. For example, Household A derives direct benefit from the homestead (A1) and agricultural land (A2). Multiple households will often use common pool resources such as woodland and grassland and these should be linked to socioeconomic data differently to reflect this fact. (Figure by Gary Watmough & Charlotte Marcinko 2020.)  Fig 113   Fig. 11.4 Side by side comparison of the high resolution imagery for Sauri and Mbola showing the different style of village. A socio-ecologically informed approach to linking socioeconomic conditions to the landscape will need to be varied in each of these sites. Local contextual knowledge would be needed to design these in the future.  Fig 114   Fig. 11.5 Showing the original DHS village location (red) and the three possible villages that could be the surveyed site (grey) within the 10 km radial buffer zone (blue) around the displaced point  Fig 115   Fig. 11.6 Improvements in household level asset estimation using directional information. (A) Currently we estimate distance to firewood or water using survey with no information about direction travelled. However, households are more likely to collect firewood and other resources when traveling through the landscape for other purposes. (B) If the direction of travel was known it is possible to estimate resource availability by considering only those parcels of land that were in the direction of travel.  Fig 116    Fig. 11.7 How geospatial data can contribute to mapping socioeconomic conditions in the gaps between surveys. A statistical model of the relationship between livelihoods and EO data can be generated using a combination of data inputs and local contextual information. The model can be used to estimate aspects of livelihoods from updated geospatial datasets and to provide partial estimations of wellbeing/poverty in the gaps between surveys. When a new household survey or census is published the relationships can be recalibrated.

But how do we achieve this with limited financial resources and insufficient capacity in national statistical offices around the world? Recent studies have demonstrated how information captured by satellite imagery can be combined with social datasets to increase our understanding of socioeconomic systems. Thus, in the future, satellite data may offer a cost-effective way to reliably measure and monitor progress towards development goals. We examine how satellite data can be linked with household and census datasets to provide information on socioeconomic conditions. We suggest that the Sustainable Livelihoods Approach provides an appropriate framework for which to develop remotely sensed earth observation (EO) data proxies for key socioeconomic conditions because it will allow the linking of data in a way that reflects more the way in which populations interact with landscapes. The aim of using EO data for mapping and predicting socioeconomic conditions is not to replace survey data but to provide more frequent information on likely socioeconomic conditions between census and survey enumeration. Timely recalibration of models predicting poverty from EO data would be necessary to reflect often rapid social, economic and political changes. However, if we are to acheive the SDGs more frequent data at finer spatial scales will be required and EO data provides a cos effective solution.

Machine learning algorithms are tracking our behaviors to provide recommendations for us to buy more stuff from online retailers, to watch TV shows and films similar to those we have already watched or listen to music artists that are similar to those we already listen to. But how are we as a planet progressing with eradicating poverty, reducing food insecurity and ensuring everyone has a safe environment in which to live and work? It is difficult to answer this question because we do not have enough data collected frequently enough in the right places for us to understand patterns and adjust policies. The UN high-level panel on post-2015 development goals called for a ‘data revolution’ to help overcome the poor quality of statistical data available in developing countries (Devarajan, 2013 ); Jerven 2013 ; (Sandefur and Glassman, 2015 ). This data revolution requires that additional datasets are collected and that their quality is maintained over time. Non-traditional data sources such as satellite earth observation (EO) data are being used to increase the understanding of the rapid changes that can occur in socioeconomic and ecological systems. In this chapter, we introduce the role that EO data could have in the big data data revolution. Earth Observing Satellites have been collecting imagery of the Earth’s surface since the launch of Landsat in 1972. These data have been used for a wide variety of purposes such as identifying settlements for planning vaccination programme delivery (Higgins et al., 2019 ), mapping of forests (Hansen et al. 2013 ), land cover (Sulla-Menashe et al. 2019 ) and ocean color (Groom et al. 2019 ). We are currently in a ‘golden-age’  for satellite data as more data are becoming available at reduced or even no-cost to users and at finer spatial1  1 The minimum mapping unit.   and temporal scales2  2 The frequency by which the satellite sensor captures images at the same point on Earth.   (Jain, 2020 ). There is increasing interest in the use of satellite data to generate data products that can be used for decision making in social and economic contexts. This ‘socializing of the pixel’ began with the use of EO data along with household surveys and field data to understand the dynamics of land use and land cover change (National Research Council 1998 ). More recently, studies have started to examine how EO data could be used to support decision making and evidence-based policy in international development, by identifying to what extent EO data can be used to predict wellbeing and poverty (Watmough et al. 2016 ; Jean et al. 2016 ; Engstrom et al. 2017 ; Ehrlich et al. 2018 ; Steele et al. 2017 ; Watmough et al. 2019 ). This is a relatively new area of research that is beginning to gain traction in academic research, government and NGOs. Therefore, we should explore further how these data could be used to help us understand changes in social, economic and ecological conditions and how this may in the future be useful for policy development. Given that many government budgets are under strain and more is having to be done with less, targeted approaches are required to increase efficiency and improve response times of interventions. Geographic targeting Geographic targeting is the process by which government resources can be tailored to specific locations or groups of people (Bigman and Fofack 2000 ). Geographic targeting is not a new idea, but it is arguably more vital than ever if we are to achieve the sustainable development goals (SDGs), and any future goals, considering the increases in world population and pressures that government resources are under. Vaccination programmes often fail to achieve complete eradication of diseases because governments simply do not know where all the population are located (Higgins et al., 2019 ). Physical access to basic services such as clinics, schools and water sources are often not known (Nesbitt et al., 2014 ) (Dougherty, 2019 ). It can take years to find out about the true impact of policies and interventions if we rely on census and survey data alone (Martin, 2007 ) (Shearmur, 2015 ) (Shearmur, 2010 ). Focusing on smaller administrative units can have a significant impact on poverty alleviation. (Baker and Grosh 1994 ; Elbers et al. 2007 ). Imagine a scenario where a development programme/project aims to reduce poverty in a particular country. Data indicates that increasing the number of children attending school and remaining there thoroughout their childhood would contribute to long term poverty reduction. In some places, children drop out of school for a multitude of reasons, including:• To provide an extra set of hands to support the family if a caregiver becomes affected by disease preventing them from bringing in an income or caring for other family members.  • To help cover a reduction in household income when remittances sent by a family member dry up due to problems in transferring the money.  • Dropping out of school due to disease or limited food intake affecting a child which can ultimately prevent them from attending school, or if they manage to get to school, their performance is severely impaired and overtime they drop out.  • The school may be too far away for children to travel to.  • The school may be too costly for families and so some children are prioritized over others within the same household.    The above list is not exhaustive and possible reasons for school non-attendance are undoubtedly longer and more complex. But what is important to recognize is that each driver of non-attendance requires a different set of policies and resources to be used to achieve the same policy goal (to increase the number of children attending and remaining in school). Potential policies in this scenario could include:• Micro-finance schemes set up to help families invest in sustainable livelihoods that do not require their own children to provide labor.  • Malaria prevention programmes to reduce the disease burden in adults and children allowing more children to attend and remain in school;  • Diarrhoea prevention to reduce disease in children and lost school days and would require changes to be made to water supplies and sanitation in the community.  • Improving physical access to schools could take the form of building new schools, although convincing teachers to relocate to remote regions is often difficult. Thus, other methods could be considered such as transport and road infrastructure improvements to help speed up travel-time to existing schools.    It is likely that reasons for children not attending school or remaining in school will vary across the country and the potential policies required to address these problems will also vary across space and time. This requires data on social, economic, health and political conditions within countries at more frequent intervals and at a finer spatial level than are presently available. Currently, it is difficult to develop targeted approaches to policy and resource allocation, and part of the reason for this is a lack of data at fine enough spatial and temporal resolutions. Governments base resource allocations on planning that is done using a national household census. This is often the largest administrative undertaking in any country as every person should be enumerated. Reflecting this huge undertaking, in most countries a census is conducted once every 10 years (Shearmur 2010 ). The gap between surveys means that if we rely solely on this information we can often see that a demographic or socioeconomic change occurred but we may not necessarily understand what was driving this change or when it started to occur during the intermediate years between enumeration (Rigg 2006 ). Returning to the school attendance scenario above, the 10-year gap would not provide information often enough to identify falling school attendance or the drivers contributing to attendance. For effective evidence-based policy and geographic targeting decision makers need access to a pipeline of regularly updated socioeconomic data that is capable of monitoring policy outcomes so that they can be adapted. To achieve this, more data is required, and in some places this is collected in the form of representative sample surveys such as the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS)3  3 Measure DHS: https://dhsprogram.com/   which is supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and the World Bank Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS).4  4 LSMS: http://surveys.worldbank.org/   These surveys collect detailed information on health, well-being and economic activities. They are repeated every 3–5 years and can provide information on progress in health and wellbeing between census enumeration periods. They can be combined using small-area estimation techniques with census data to improve coverage and depth of understanding (Elbers et al. 2003 ). However, they are not always nationally representative and the methods used for the data collection are more suitable for comparing between countries or progress over time rather than supporting country-level policy makers (Sandefur and Glassman 2015 ). Furthermore, there are questions over the reliability and quality of some data (Devarajan 2013) and suggestions that monitoring progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals requires additional consumption surveys to be conducted every year to complement the census and demographic and health surveys (Jerven 2017 ). The cost of doing this is prohibitively expensive (Jerven 2014 ) and so it is unlikely to happen in most countries and almost certainly will not happen in the countries that require the most assistance. Even if the funding could be found to support this approach, many national statistics offices lack the physical capabilities to perform, clean, process, publish and analyse annual household sample surveys. Furthermore, the training of new staff would take so long that the SDGs would have been completed by the time this is achieved. It is clear then that we are lacking information on socioeconomic conditions at appropriate spatial and temporal scales to be able to design better policies. If we were to use traditional survey tools to provide the data at finer spatial and temporal scales the costs would escalate so rapidly that there would be little money left for actual development policies to be implemented. What then could be done differently? One answer would be to use mobile phone technology and big data to record social interactions and economic transactions of the population. However, smart phone usage and coverage is not universal and in developing country contexts it is likely that the poorest communities would be missed using only this sort of big data approach; not to mention the ethical considerations of using people’s personal information. EO data does not discriminate based on access to technology. If links between EO data and social, economic and ecological conditions can be derived, EO data offers opportunities to gain more frequent and more spatially expansive data to support existing practices and allow geographic targeting and policy updates in the years between traditional census and surveys.   Using EO data for understanding socioeconomic conditions The premise of using EO data for mapping socioeconomic conditions is that there are often close links between population and environment (Okwi et al. 2007 ; Watmough et al. 2013a ; Watmough et al. 2016 ). Particular landscape characteristics are often associated with wealthy or poor areas. Since satellite imagery can be used to map environmental conditions and landscape characteristics we should be able to say something about wealth or poverty by mapping these. For example, wealthy neighborhoods have been found to be greener than poorer neighborhoods in various parts of North America (Ogneva-himmelberger et al. 2009 ; Jensen et al. 2004 ; Lafary et al. 2008 ). This is because wealthier families were clustered together in areas where dwellings were larger and had more abundant gardens, parks and recreational grounds nearby. So, it was possible to differentiate between rich and poor areas by looking at greenness measured from EO data in several locations in North America (Lafary et al. 2008 ; Li and Weng 2007 ). Of course, it is never that simple, and applying these methods to Detroit shows this. Due to the considerable reduction in overall population in Detroit over the last 50 years, vegetation has reclaimed once developed areas. Where there were houses and businesses there are now green areas and, in Detroit, these greener areas were often associated with the poorest communities due to urban decay and depopulation (Emmanuel 1997 ). This emphasizes important points about the use of EO data to map aspects of socioeconomic conditions. Poverty and wellbeing are complex and will never be fully explained by EO metrics alone. No single model will work everywhere, context is key and the aim in using EO data for mapping socioeconomic conditions is not to replace household surveys and census enumeration but to support them. Therefore, an understanding of the social, political, economic and ecological conditions of particular areas will be required when using EO data in supporting decision making. Predicting poverty from EO data in developing countries In developing countries, the relationships between wellbeing and environmental conditions are complex and it is unlikely that a relationship between wellbeing and NDVI5  5 The NDVI is a measure of vegetated greenness commonly estimated using satellite data in the red and near-infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The index ranges from −1 to 1 with values closer to 1 indicating greener areas (Lillesand et al. 2004 ).  /greenness would be helpful. A lot of developing countries have a high reliance on agriculture and environmental resources such as woodland, and as such many of these areas are green. Thus, attempting to differentiate between poor and non-poor areas using a measure of greenness is unlikely to be as informative as it was in North America. However, the strong reliance on natural resources, agricultural practices and the role of ecosystem services in supporting communities means that different metrics derived from EO data could provide useful insights into socioeconomic conditions (Table 11.1  ). Examples of recent efforts to look in more detail about how remotely sensed data can be used to estimate aspects of poverty/livelihoods include:• In Assam, North-east India a mixture of 30 m and 500 m spatial resolution Landsat and MODIS EO data (Table 11.1 ) were able to explain up to 61 percent of the variation in village level poverty estimated using the 2001 Indian National Census (Watmough et al. 2013a ; 2016 ).  • In Sri Lanka, land use, infrastructure and car density metrics (Table 11.1 ) estimated from 55 individual scenes of very-high spatial resolution satellite imagery available from QuickBird, GEOEYE-1 and WorldView-2 were able to explain up to 60 percent of the variance in poverty at the finest census enumeration district (Engstrom et al. 2017 ).  • In Bangladesh a mixture of geospatial datasets which included EO data (Table 11.1 ) and cell phone call data records were able to explain up to 78 percent of the variance in asset level poverty (Steele et al. 2017 ).  • In Sauri Millennium Village located in Kenya, very high spatial resolution land use maps were combined with time series data from MODIS to predict household level poverty and the remotely sensed metrics were able to explain up to 62 percent of the variation in asset-based poverty (Watmough et al. 2019 ).    Poverty and wellbeing are complex and vary on an individual basis within the same household. Women and girls can often have very different experiences to men and boys. It is not the intention of the poverty from space discipline to predict poverty at these levels or to work in a reductionist way to show that a few key spatial metrics can be used to determine poverty. None of the studies mentioned above are attempting to explain the causes of poverty from space data. Rather they are attempting to identify patterns in geospatial data that are correlated with poverty and wellbeing that could help decision makers and policy makers target specific sets of resources and approaches to specific regions. To do this, some studies identify a set of key metrics that could be extracted from EO data and link them back to aspects of poverty. For example, Watmough et al. (2013b  & 2016 ) provide details on how they used mixed-method field data collection and local expert knowledge to identify key livelihood strategies. These were used to identify ways in which aspects of these strategies could be estimated using proxies from satellite imagery (Table 11.2  ). In other studies, a data mining approach has been taken to identify the best set of parameters for predicting the outcome poverty scores (Jean et al. 2016 ; Steele et al. 2017  and Pokhriyal and Jaques 2017 ). Data mining approaches are a useful statistical tool for exploratory analysis as they can help identify EO metrics that have significant relationships with scoioeconomic conditions. However, if we are to begin designing methods for geographic targeting of resources by integrating EO and social survey data we need to be clear on what the EO metrics are showing so that temporal changes in these metrics can be interpreted. Therefore, its useful to know from Jean et al. (2016)  that in rural areas the night-time lights data have no signal (its dark and there is little light pollution in the area). However, this metric would not contribute much towards predicting changes in poverty unless night-time lights appeared in a previously dark region. We need to consider how these approaches can be useful for decision makers. So explaining why a particular metric is related to poverty is more important than ensuring a higher level of overall model accuracy at this stage.  The sustainable livelihoods approach for generating EO proxies of socioeconomic conditions There is a need for researchers to be clear on why particular EO metrics are related to wellbeing/poverty. For example, is an NDVI time series telling us anything about rural poverty or should we convert this into estimated number of harvests per year or the number of agricultural growing days over the season? Existing studies have all used a variety of metrics derived from EO data and often none of them are consistent as they use different satellite sensors, different study locations, and different EO metrics as proxies for different aspects of poverty (Table 11.1 ). Given the complex, nuanced picture of poverty it is no surprise that the predictive accuracies vary markedly between past studies. The variations can be due to the way that poverty/wellbeing was estimated, Steele et al. (2017)  and Engstrom et al. (2017)  report models using several different measures of poverty and the amount of variation explained by EO metrics varies depending on the measure of poverty/wellbeing/welfare selected. Predictions of poverty using EO data appear to have higher accuracies when predicting asset-based wealth indices compared to consumption and income-based measures (Steele et al. 2017 ; Engstrom et al. 2017 ). Furthermore, the ability of EO data to explain variation across the wealth spectrum also appears to vary. Watmough et al. (2016)  find that when using the wealth quintiles remotely sensed metrics are able to explain up to 61 percent of the variance in the poorest villages, 55 percent in the wealthiest villages but for the middle groups the explanatory power of the model is reduced to ∼45 percent. They suggest this is likely due to two main reasons: (1) the arbitrary way in which quintiles split wealth data meaning that there is often little difference between villages in different categories, and; (2) the poorest villages have greater use of the land for livelihoods and thus it is harder to predict the wealthier areas using EO data. Over the coming years data science approaches should be used to analyse the relationships between the growing number of EO data products available and various measures of wellbeing, poverty and inequality. The important point is that we do not try and predict poverty or income but rather we look at multi-dimensional poverty. Doing so helps policy and structures how EO data can be useful. For example, Berchoux et al. (2019a)  found in India that household and community capitals had different impacts on household livelihoods and should be considered separately when planning poverty alleviation policies. The sustainable livelihoods approach (SLA) goes beyond the conventional definitions of poverty that often focus on income (Krantz 2001 ). Rather the SLA takes into consideration that most households have a portfolio of assets which contribute to a living (Chambers and Conway 1991 ). Assets are often grouped into five different capitals; human (skills, knowledge and good health providing an ability to work), financial (the capital base such as cash, credit and debt and savings), social (networks, social relations, affiliations and associations people draw upon when pursuing livelihood strategies), physical (infrastructure, equipment and technologies essential for livelihood strategies) and natural (the natural resource stocks such as soil, water, air, and genetic resources and environmental services such as hydrological cycle, pollution sinks providing resource flows and services) (Krantz 2001 ; Chambers and Conway 1991 ). A SLA to using EO data for mapping aspects of socioeconomic conditions has two clear advantages:1 It makes it clear that EO data products are being used to estimate aspects of poverty/wellbeing in proxy format and we are not attempting to reduce poverty to a few simple satellite derived metrics.  2 Changes mapped in EO data can be related to particular aspects of rural development (Fig. 11.1  ) and will in time be more informative to decision makers than a single index of poverty from space.    The rest of the chapter focuses on how we can use data science to better link socioeconomic and remotely sensed datasets.   How can we socialize the pixel? One of the major challenges in linking EO and social datasets are the formats in which they are available. Most EO data come in pixel form whilst most social data come associated with specific social entities such as household, village, district. The simplest way to deal with this difference is to convert one or the other so that all data are in the same format. When looking at social remote sensing the traditional approach is to use some form of administrative boundary or social boundary information to link the data together (Fig. 11.2  ). This is because most people or communities do not operate in a single pixel. We need a diversity of pixels to tell us something about a landscape surrounding a social entity to understand some of the complexities and variation within the environmental conditions in the area of interest. Often EO data are processed into two main formats:1 Pixels with similar reflectance values are grouped together using statistical algorithms into land cover or land use classifications.  2 Biophysical measurements are proxied using indices, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) which shows how green an area is.    These data products are related with socioeconomic outcomes within the social entity of interest. Here a social entity could be a household (Watmough et al. 2019 ), hamlet, village (Watmough et al. 2016 ), cluster of villages (Jean et al. 2016 ), county, district (Berchoux et al. 2019b ) or census enumeration district (Engstrom et al. 2017 ). Using the social division each study extracts EO metrics, for example the fraction of the social entity that is covered in a particular land use class or the number of buildings within the social entity. These aggregated metrics are then used in statistical models to examine if they can be used to explain the variance in the social outcome of interest. Thus, when using a single spatial level for the analysis effectively, each study is assuming that the relationships between poverty and remotely sensed proxy metrics are homogeneous within the chosen division. More than this, they are assuming that the benefits gained by the population from the satellite data proxies are only felt within the spatial extent of the social division and any pixels/resources outside of the social division are ignored. There are a series of assumptions within this approach that need to be unpacked. First, when aggregating pixels to the social entity the implied assumption is that the EO metric (e.g. greenness) within the census enumeration district is directly related to wealth. No account is made for how the metric in neighboring regions may be also related to wealth. Effectively the assumption is that the EO metric within a single social entity (in this case the district) is related in some way to the wellbeing of the residents of that particular social entity. Furthermore, no consideration is made on access to the resources in this approach. Some people within the social entity may not be able to use the environmental resource that is being estimated using EO data. This is the basic premise of most studies exploring the relationships between EO data and poverty/wellbeing. Each is effectively assuming that there is some relationship between the socioeconomic conditions of a particular social entity, (household, village, cluster of villages, census enumeration district or even country) and the landscape within this entity characterized by satellite data. If working at the village level in rural areas of developing countries, there is an assumption that the landscape within the village boundary is used by households to achieve livelihood outcomes such as agriculture, livestock grazing, firewood collection, water collection etc. and so these environmental resources can be linked directly to the socioeconomic outcomes of the village. Relating these together using statistical models can provide an understanding of what a poor village looks like compared to a wealthier village. However, this is not always the case. For example, at the village level, over time it is likely that land parcels are bought and sold, traded and inherited. This can lead to situations where households own and operate non-contiguous fields and some of these fields could be outside of the village boundary (Fig. 11.2 ). For fields and environmental resources outside of the village boundary we ignore these resources when constructing statistical models to explain the variance in socioeconomic conditions. However, these fields and resources are being used by households in this area for livelihood strategies. The same can be said for fields within the boundary that are being used by households in neighboring villages, these resources would be included in the model for village A but they are contributing to the overall economic activity of village B. A further example can be found in Dadvand et al. (2015)  where when examining the relationship between green space and cognitive development of children they found that the greenness surrounding the home, commuting route and school were positively correlated with attentiveness in children. Thus, the one-to-one relationship between social entity and pixels commonly used in EO for poverty research is not fully representative of the way in which land is managed and used by communities to derive livelihoods or when deriving benefits from green space.  A socio-ecologically informed approach to linking EO and socioeconomic data Considering how the landscape is being used by the communities is an important step when trying to map socioeconomic conditions using EO data. If we take an SLA approach for developing EO metrics as proxies for socioeconomic outcomes we can consider a more detailed approach to linking social and EO datasets. This approach can consider how individual parcels of land are used in different ways by households. Some land parcels such as agricultural fields are farmed by a single family and few if any other families directly benefit from this land. Thus, this field should ideally be linked to an individual household. Other parcels of land such as field boundaries, woodland, grassland and water bodies are often used by multiple people from the community and can therefore be linked to multiple households (Fig. 11.3  ). However, the prevailing approaches in the literature do not consider this level of complexity. This is often because the socioeconomic data available are aggregated to village or larger levels. Watmough et al. (2019)  used a socio-ecologically informed approach to link households with EO data in Kenya. This approach considered how the landscape is used by individual households and attempted to replicate this using EO data. Using Household survey data to inform the structure of the linkages they split the landscape into four different levels: homestead; agricultural field; community; wider village (Fig. 11.3 ). This approach linked the pixels within a homestead to the single household that owned this land because that household was likely the only one to directly benefit from that land. Agricultural land was linked to adjacent households as in this region of Kenya agricultural fields were often next to the homesteads. This was a one-to-one relationship as the agricultural produce would be directly benefitting a single household. However, pixels in the third and fourth levels (community and wider village) were allocated to multiple households which reflected the fact that use of woodland, rivers and grazing land are common pool resources and shared by several households. This approach to linking EO and poverty explained more of the variance in poverty than a traditional radial buffer zone around each Household (Watmough et al. 2019 ). Socioecological approaches to linking EO data and poverty would be able to consider the different ways in which the landscape is used and adapt the linking strategy accordingly. For example, in regions with nucleated villages it is likely that the agricultural fields will not be adjacent to the households that own them and therefore different methods would be required to link agricultural fields to households (Fig. 11.4  ). This would arguably increase the amount of work required to link EO data and socioeconomic data together. However, if the aim is to provide detailed, accurate and timely information on wellbeing for geographic targeting it should be that the approach to generate this information is also geographically targeted. This will undoubtedly increase the amount of data processing required as the way in which the landscape is used will change within a country and over time. Thus, data science methods will be needed to process these fine spatial resolution datasets frequently. An adaptive approach to the linking of EO and socioeconomic datasets will require detailed spatial information on land use management practices across countries. Elbers et al. (2007)  show that targeting finer scale units led to more success in poverty alleviation with households the most successful. However, it is unlikely that relating EO metrics to measures of individual household poverty, as in Watmough et al. (2019) , will be developed into a policy tool as it relies on highly detailed household surveys that are too expensive to upscale nationally. Furthermore, individual households may be too fine a spatial scale for geographic targeting to focus on. It is likely that larger administrative units would be used instead. However, EO data could be used to aggregate proxies of some household capitals (Fig. 11.1 ) efficiently using very-high spatial resolution satellite data such as in Watmough et al. 2019 . This household level information aggregated to the community level would help to differentiate different types of community which would help develop policies. For example, Berchoux et al. (2019) showed that combining census, survey and remote sensing data at the district level in Odisha could help differentiate different determinants of poverty and identify different factors that helped mediate against agricultural shocks. Thus, EO data could help reduce the need for some costly field data collection approaches in years between surveys. Fine spatial and temporal resolution data will be needed to improve the chances of achieving the SDGs by enabling increased understanding of the links between social and ecological systems. It is not possible to collect all of the required data from traditional household surveys, population registers and censuses to achieve this level of detail and EO and data science offer an intriguing opportunity to fill in some of the gaps between these traditional surveys. The vision we have is for a data science approach to be developed whereby overtime EO data becomes an integral part of the monitoring and mapping of socioeconomic conditions at fine spatial and temporal resolution. A pipeline would be developed whereby Census, Micro-census, household surveys, volunteered-geographic information and EO data would be combined to calibrate a model for estimating various wellbeing/poverty metrics. Further models would be developed that minimise the use of survey data to allow data sceintists to understand how well EO data alone can predict poverty. Then in periods between survey collection the EO data can be maintained as an efficient tool to monitor changes. The models can be re-calibrated when new surveys and census data become available to ensure that the correct EO metrics are being used. This is an important aspect to consider as overtime as communities and region develop the relationships between poverty and EO metrics will change. This approach would minimise the need for additional costly household surveys and allow for targeting of resources to regions that display the least positive change or sudden negative changes. Limitations when linking EO and socioeconomic datasets for estimating poverty The Watmough et al. (2019)  study in Kenya had access to household survey data that had each house geo-located with a GPS point. This is unusual and not available publicly due to confidentiality reasons. The most commonly available household survey data include the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) Data, the Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS) and the Multidimensional Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS). Each of these data sets are provided at the household level however the GPS location is given as the village centroid for each and then displaced by a random amount to protect the anonymity of the respondents. The standard method for doing this has been developed by DHS and involves adding a random displacement to the latitude and longitude of any rural GPS locations in any direction up to 5 km and for 1 percent of the sample this displacement is up to 10 km (Burgert 2013 ). This is very successful at protecting the anonymity of the respondents but does compromise the utility of the spatial location information for further studies. Often when linking EO data with the DHS data points a radial buffer zone of 10 km is added around the point and all pixels within this are linked to the DHS data. Analysis is therefore at the cluster of households. Some studies have suggested that this has limited impact on the results when linking environmental data to the DHS points (Warren et al. 2016 ). However, this was a limited assessment of the impact and more analyses are needed on, for example, measuring access from communities to services such as clinics and schools. The impact of the displacement of GPS on geographic targeting of resources could have significant impacts. It certainly compromises the ability to take a socio-ecologically informed approach to linking socioeconomic data with satellite data. If the village has been displaced by up to 10 km from its original location it is difficult to know which resources to link to the village socioeconomic conditions (Fig. 11.5  ). This could compromise any policy relevant information that could be produced using EO data. Grace et al. (2019)  recommended that when overlaid with high resolution satellite images the displaced village point could be manually relocated to the nearest settlement and then a 2 km radial buffer zone around this settlement be used rather than a 10 km radial buffer zone around the displaced point. However, this may still compromise high resolution geographic targeting as there is no way of knowing whether any modeled relationships are based on accurate/real proximity between the people surveyed by the DHS and EO derived metrics. Systems are in place whereby GPS can be used and integrated with other datasets without the end user ever having to see or receive the GPS points themselves. However, there are two issues with this approach; (1) a level of governance is required whereby researchers are vetted and then approved to use the data and this needs to be properly funded and maintained overtime with full training in privacy law, and; (2) machine learning algorithms pose a risk to confidentiality even here as it would in theory be possible to use EO data metrics to re-engineer the position of settlements or households. A future discussion is required on the utility of the GPS displacement if we are to make the most of the almost continual improvements in spatial and temporal resolution of satellite data along with the exponential increases in other data available in which to add more value to our models and approaches. Further discussion is required on which level it is appropriate to be targeting resources and therefore also our research? Poverty and socioeconomic dynamics are complex and they vary on an individual level as well as varying for each individual over time. So the more focused the geographic analysis can be the better our understanding will be of the issues and the better the policy would be. However, there is a trade-off here with privacy levels for individuals. Furthermore, we also need to consider at which level governments and decision makers need the information and at what administrative level resources are distributed at? This is likely to vary by country but it’s likely that there is going to be a trade-off between accuracy and practicality. It would be more accurate to focus on individual households but this is not practical for decision making. Open freely available data is often compromised for geographic targeting and as data availability increases and computing power improves we need to use these freely available data sets in combination with more detailed local information. This is because reliance on freely available data often means we are left with coarse spatial resolution analyses that cannot be used for local level decision making.   Future directions for EO and social data In this chapter we have explored how EO data can be used to support the mapping of socioeconomic conditions. It is a relatively new area of research with approximately 30 articles published so far on mapping and/or predicting poverty from space. These studies have often used socioeconomic data aggregated to social entities such as villages and census enumeration areas. Aggregation introduces the chance of problems associated with the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) where changing the level of aggregation could result in very different relationships between poverty and EO proxies. There is a requirement then, for data science to be used to understand the relationships between poverty and EO proxies at a range of spatial scales. This can be done by considering how people interact with the landscape at different spatial scales and factoring that into operational data science approaches. At a fine spatial scale it can be achieved by considering separately how household and community assets contribute to the livelihoods of each household (Watmough et al. 2019 ). Future work should look to upscale relationships found at the household level and examine how poverty and EO data proxies for livelihood capitals are related to one another across different regions and countries and how the relationships change over time. If we have a socio-ecologically informed approach to linked EO data with social data and we use a sustainable livelihoods framework to identify EO data metrics, further development is also possible. In countries where rural livelihoods are still primarily dependent on agriculture, volunteered geographic information could be provided by individual households on the location of each agricultural field. The use of very-high spatial resolution data to estimate agricultural yields (Burke et al. 2017 ) could be integrated into this approach to provide estimates for individual households harvest. Where agriculture is still the dominant economic activity, this could provide considerable improvements to understanding local socioeconomic conditions using EO data. This can always be aggregated to community level yield estimates for decision making but having the fine spatial resolution data available should help stakeholders identify problematic regions and worrying trends in the data much quicker than a single averaged yield estimated across a community. Mobile phone technology could also be used to identify the route that household members take to get to fields and other resources (Fig. 11.6  ). This could be a vital next step if we are to understand the usage of environmental resources such as woodland, grazing land and water bodies. Currently, researchers often use household survey tools to determine how far people travel from their households to collect firewood and then use this to create a radial buffer zone around the household to cover the area. However, if a household’s fields are clustered in one direction it is likely that fire wood collection will, more often than not, be focused in that region and not in a radial zone around the household (Fig. 11.6 ). If the most common direction of travel could be identified, more information would be available on where households regularly collect particular communal resources thus allowing future knowledge and decisions to be based on actual usage of landscape parcels. This is all now possible if existing satellite, mobile phone and volunteered geographic information technologies were combined. Currently we have seen that studies are joining various survey datasets with geospatial data to establish how EO data metrics are related to poverty or wellbeing (Fig. 11.7  ). The ultimate goal however is to use these relationships to fill in the gaps between census and survey collection. New census and surveys could be used to re-calibrate models and in the intervening years the geospatial metrics selected could be continually mapped and monitored for unusual activity. Any changes can be investigated further with ground teams and additional data. EO data alone will not predict all aspects of poverty or wellbeing. Poverty and economic development are complex and are continually shifting over time as people’s livelihood strategies vary and adapt to reflect changes in household demographics and opportunities and challenges generated by changes in local, regional and national level climate, markets and policies. The value of EO data is not to fully capture all aspects of development and socioeconomic conditions but rather to estimate socioeconomic conditions and identify potential changes at frequent time periods and small spatial scales between census enumeration (Fig. 11.7 ). If this approach can be operationised and a made more widely available systems that provide reguler updated socioeconomic conditions could be built. Furthermore, when unexpected changes appear in EO data or no change occurs in EO data after a policy is implemented ground teams could be directed to investigate further. This could foster a greater understanding of policy impacts by observing and mapping impacts and changes at a much finer spatial and temporal scale than is currently possible in rural areas of devleoping countries. The relationships derived from current EO and socioeconomic datasets may also have value and application in exploring the potential impacts of future environmental change or government policy on multidimensional poverty. Future climate change combined with the impacts of human activity could have significant affects on land use and land cover (LULC). They can affect forest area (e.g. deforestation), vegetation diversity, availability of water, degradation of agricultural land. Many of these land characteristics can be proxied by EO variables as indicated in Table 11.1 . Assuming the relationships found between EO derived LULC data and socioeconomic data remain constant into the future and substituting in projected values of LULC variables into our models could allow the calculation of the related poverty measure into the future, at least in the short term. For example, a regional government may want to introduce a policy which designates a woodland area currently used by local communities as a common pool resource as protected, restricting access. How might this affect the wellbeing of these communities? A model run could be constructed which simulated the removal of this resource and recalculates the poverty measure for the local communities. Furthermore, the impact of road or bridge building or resurfacing could be examined by updating time to access variables with projected decreases in travel time. The impact of climate change could be considered by updating forest/agriculture variables based on future changes predicted by forest/agriculture models.  Conclusions A major challenge to understanding socio-ecological change and targeting development resources to where they are needed is the lack of simultaneous data on socioeconomic, environmental and climatic conditions (Brown et al. 2014 ). Multiple data are needed at fine spatial and temporal resolutions if we are to achieve the SDGs. Doing so with traditional surveys is not going to be sufficient due to gaps in coverage and prohibitive costs. Therefore, we need to incorporate additional data sources from volunteered geographic data and earth observation platforms. The advantage of EO data is that if it is processed using standard approaches (Jain 2020 ) it can provide a standardized product. It could be used to monitor changes and when these are flagged as unusual or unexpected household surveys could be targeted at specific places to identify what has changed. Over time, as understanding increases we could develop a database of EO metrics that are known to be useful proxies for specific outcomes and so changes in these could be measures and understood to be indicating changes in particular SEC. Therefore, allowing policy or intervention with geographically targeted resource allocations. As new national surveys are published the models can be re-calibrated. If we add in social media, geographic data from google maps, Facebook etc. this will increase the amount of data and understanding of the systems further.
