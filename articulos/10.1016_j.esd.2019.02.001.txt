This is confirmed by the recognition of these two issues in the 2030 Agenda represented by the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement (Hubacek, Baiocchi, Feng, & Patwardhan, 2017 ). Yet it is also increasingly clear that these two challenges are interrelated. Recent research, in fact, has begun to pull together hitherto separate areas of study to examine the relationship between the challenges of poverty reduction and environmental protection. Much of this work focuses on the effects of climate change on socio-economic development for populations in poverty. One area of interest, for example, relates to the effects of extreme weather events on poverty and agricultural production (Hallegatte et al., 2015 ). Less attention has been given to the other side of this relationship, namely the potential effects of poverty eradication on the environment. The question here is if, and how, lifting all people above the poverty line (a minimum consumption level required to meet basic human needs)1  1 Poverty will be better conceptualized in the Methods section.   will increase levels of harmful emissions and, therefore, worsen the prospects for climate change. More specifically, is it possible for countries to eradicate poverty within a sustainable level of emissions? While the direct relationship between other well-being indicators and emissions has been studied (Steinberger & Roberts, 2010 ), the relationship between poverty eradication and the environment has been examined mostly through indirect frameworks that analyze the link between income levels and pollutants in the form of carbon emissions (Stern, 2017 ). This literature focuses on the impact of economic growth on emissions, leaving poverty reduction as a by-product of growth (Dollar, Kleineberg, & Kraay, 2016 ). Only recently, in fact, have scholars begun to examine this relationship more directly by analyzing the potential effects on the environment (in terms of carbon emission levels) of global poverty reduction, such as the study from Hubacek et al. (2017) . While their article makes a significant contribution to our understanding of the potential impact of poverty eradication on climate change, several gaps remain in our understanding of the relevance of this relationship. First, although the recent study by Hubacek et al. (2017)  provides initial evidence of the potential direct impact of poverty eradication on the environment, their analysis is based on the assumption that the eradication of poverty results in increases in the consumption levels solely of individuals lifted out of poverty.2  2 They also include the increased investments from governments to meet this increase in consumption.   Such changes can be achieved through one form of policy, namely perfectly targeted cash transfers to individuals in poverty to fill the poverty gap. Yet poverty is also addressed by the broader development paths that governments adopt and that consist of a multitude of different types of policies. Development may mean, for example, that poverty reduction is accompanied by structural change and changing consumption patterns in other population segments as the middle classes expand (Gertler, Shelef, Wolfram, & Fuchs, 2016 ). Further research is needed, therefore, to understand the impact of broader development paths that work not only to address poverty at the lowest income levels through direct and targeted policies. Second, while Hubacek et al. (2017)  provide a snapshot of how emission levels would be affected at one point in time if poverty eradication is pursued, they do not analyze how the relationship between poverty and emissions may change over time.3  3 They assume that the carbon intensity does not change until 2030.   It is critical, however, to understand whether the relationship remains stable or whether a decoupling process occurs in which further reductions in poverty over time result in either fewer or greater emission levels. Third, a broader view of the relationship between emission levels and poverty eradication needs to include the mediating role of energy use. In fact, reductions in emissions may also arise from reductions in the energy content of economic activity (energy intensity), and not only from the de‑carbonization of energy services (carbon intensity). While mitigation scenarios call for the complete decoupling of emissions from energy, they also assume a further improvement of energy intensity (Steckel, Brecha, Jakob, Strefler, & Luderer, 2013 ) However, significant decreases in energy consumption are unlikely in relation to minimal development objectives, especially given the positive correlation between per capita income and energy consumption at relatively early stages of development (Martínez & Ebenhack, 2008 ; Steinberger & Roberts, 2010 ). More work is required, therefore, to extend existing studies to properly capture the dynamics of the relationship between poverty, energy and emission levels. Given these premises, this study aims to address the following research questions related to the feasibility of eradicating poverty by 2030 within sustainable emissions: (i) What is the relationship between poverty and both emission and energy levels across countries, defined as the poverty-energy-emissions pathway ? What are the average levels of emissions and energy use associated with the eradication of poverty in the current pathway? (ii) Has this relationship (i.e., the pathway) changed over time? (iii) What is the increase in emissions associated with the goal of poverty eradication by 2030, considering the previous estimates? How do different policy scenarios compare? To answer these questions, the study employs data from 149 countries between 1981 and 2012 drawn from multiple sources. Alongside poverty headcount estimates, carbon emissions are used as a proxy for environmental pollutants that impact climate change. The choice to use macro data is driven by the objective to estimate the average poverty-energy-emissions pathway at the country level, by fitting the best functional form. Moreover, the countries included in the analysis account for almost the totality of global emissions and world poverty; this is critical in order to draw implications at the global level. While the analysis aims to explore the relationship between poverty eradication and environmental factors across both countries and time, it does not aim to look at causality or endogeneity issues between the outcomes under consideration. It is clear, for example, that increases in emissions worsen climate change impacts, hindering the ability to eradicate poverty. Three key findings may be identified from the results of the study. First, a significant trade-off at the country level exists between poverty reduction on one side, and emissions and energy use on the other. This trade-off changes, however, at different emission and energy use levels. The estimated relationships between poverty and both emissions and energy use can, in fact, be approximated by a generalized logistic function. Moreover, the average levels of emissions and energy use associated with poverty eradication are, respectively, 2.57 tons of CO2  and 2.52 tons of oil equivalent per capita per year. On the other hand, low poverty levels (5%) can be reached with lower emission levels and energy use (1.52 and 1.39 tons respectively).4  4 Using estimates from non-weighted regressions to calculate the country, and not the population weighted, average.   Second, the analysis provides evidence of a decoupling process between both emissions and energy use, and poverty over time. This implies that the same poverty level is associated with lower levels of emissions (and energy use) in more recent years. It may be noted that the decoupling process has been more significant for emission levels than for energy use. Some possible explanations for this decoupling are the decrease in the carbon intensity (of energy and GDP), the energy intensity of GDP, and the recent proliferation in the use of direct antipoverty policies. Third, the findings suggest that eradicating poverty by 2030 through targeted policies (such as direct cash transfers) would cause significantly lower environmental harm compared to the case of developing countries following the current poverty-energy-emissions pathway. From the findings it is clear that, in order to eradicate poverty while addressing emission levels, low- and middle-income countries should not follow ‘business as usual’ represented by the current poverty-emissions pathway.5  5 It is also indicates that the last mile in eradicating poverty is the one mostly inefficient (Chandy, Kato, & Kharas, 2015 ).   From a policy perspective, the results also confirm and highlight the challenges in meeting significant improvements in the energy and carbon intensities, as assumed in suggested climate scenarios (Steckel et al., 2013 ). First, the findings of this study show that it is difficult to expect a further significant decrease in energy levels associated with poverty eradication. Meeting basic needs will always require a minimum amount of energy.6  6 This is in parallel with research showing that energy use is expected to double by 2100 (Davis et al., 2018 ).   Moreover, although the price of renewable energy is declining to become more competitive, the findings suggest that achieving total carbon neutrality of energy is still a challenge. Significant disruption from historical trends is difficult due to inertia, lock-ins and political barriers (Labordena, Patt, Bazilian, Howells, & Lilliestam, 2017 ). Therefore, a different approach, represented by redistribution and the use of targeted policies, may be a better solution, especially in the short term, to meet basic needs within environmental boundaries. Of course, in parallel, high-income countries will need to significantly decrease their emissions. As a final point, this study contributes to the literature on sustainable development by estimating the poverty-energy-emissions pathway and the direct relationship between poverty and environmental outcomes, as well as giving evidence of a decoupling process over time.7  7 O'Neill et al. (2018)  also consider poverty among many development indicators, but they do not present estimates of thresholds or decoupling processes.   To date, studies have not addressed this critical relationship, due in part to limitations in the availability of poverty estimates (Jean et al., 2016 ). This gap is particularly relevant in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals and, more in general, sustainable development, where policymakers aim to achieve both poverty reduction and climate change mitigation jointly. By comparing different policy scenarios, this study shows the potential implications of poverty eradication on global emissions. The article is organized as follows. In the next section the background to the study and a literature review are presented. The Methods section describes the data used in this study, as well as the methods applied for the analysis. The Results section presents the findings from the analysis. In the last section, the policy implications and conclusions are discussed.  Background and literature review Recent international agreements underline the need to achieve simultaneously the goals of poverty eradication and the avoidance of environmental degradation, including climate change mitigation. The recognition of these two goals as central has matured over the past decades due to a number of developments that have affected the policy arena. After centuries of being considered topics of peripheral interest for public policy, both poverty eradication and environmental protection have emerged as crucial issues at the center of policy-making. In fact, it has been widely accepted that governments have a role to play, as both issues are consequences of market failures. This happened mainly in two specific periods (Bhagwat & Newsham, 2016 ; Ravallion, 2016 ). The first occurred in the aftermath of the industrial revolution; the second in the 1950's and 1960's with a focus on the concept of justice and the status quo of the capitalistic society. Still, poverty reduction and environmental protection continued to be treated as quite separate issues even after these developments. Only in the past fifty years, in fact, have the links between these two policy goals begun to be established. The first significant effort to link poverty and climate change came in 1972 with the birth of sustainability  as a dominant policy term at the United Nations Conference on Human Environment in Stockholm; this signaled the need to reduce the environmental impacts of economic growth and to merge developmental and environmental concerns. Following this shift, Brundtland (1987)  coined the term sustainable development as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs ”. The Brundtland report underlined poverty reduction as a positive strategy for environmental goals. The new approach proposed by this report was based on the idea that the two goals of poverty and environmental protection are actually complementary, as poverty is one of the main causes of environmental degradation. In subsequent years, more links between the two goals were established, culminating in the recent Sustainable Development Goals (from hereon SDGs). These goals underline that human development needs to be achieved in an environmentally sustainable way, as represented by recent frameworks (Raworth, 2017 ; Rockström et al., 2009 ). It should be noted, of course, that in many cases such proposals are linked to the argument that, in seeking solutions to eradicate poverty in a sustainable way, business as usual is not the answer (Woodward, 2015 ). Despite its current relevance, the concept of sustainable development still presents fundamental shortcomings. One important issue involves the differing viewpoints between high- and lower income countries. While the first group has been forcefully voicing concerns about environmental justice (considering the unequal impact of environmental change on the poor), the latter group of countries remains more focused on the human dimensions of economic development. Low- (and middle-) income countries still have high levels of unmet basic needs. In fact, Guha and Alier (1997)  define these countries as “too poor to be green ”. On the other hand, richer economies have a higher level of responsibility due to the high carbon intensity of their historical development path. As a result, it remains unclear which development path emerging economies will (or should) follow, how much high-income countries will decrease their emissions, and how both national and international agencies should address the intersection between economic growth and well-being with environmental protection. The answers to such questions have significant implications for the environmental sustainability of poverty eradication. Literature review and gaps A growing literature highlights the negative impacts of climate change on poverty reduction efforts (Hallegatte et al., 2015 ). Yet similar evidence and quantification are missing on the potential effects of poverty eradication on the environment, especially in terms of increases in carbon emission. In fact, much of the work on the relationship between poverty reduction and the environment remains conceptual in nature. Barbier (2010)  developed a theoretical model to analyze how the rural poor depend on environmental goods. This study argues that the relationship between poverty and natural resources depends on a range of mediating factors. Gertler et al. (2016)  and Wolfram, Shelef, and Gertler (2012)  also underline that poverty eradication may impact emission levels, as individuals exiting poverty will acquire energy-intensive assets and consume more energy on the extensive, rather than intensive, margin. These scholars also claim that this non-linearity is not taken sufficiently into account into energy projections and models. Despite the potential relevance of the impact of poverty eradication on emissions, few empirical analyses of this relationship exist. Extant research examines this relationship in some selected countries, and in selected contexts related to specific programs. Alix-Garcia, McIntosh, Sims, and Welch (2013) , for example, study the impact of poverty reduction on local deforestation rates. Gertler et al. (2016) , on the other hand, show that an antipoverty transfer program implemented in Mexico had a significant effect on the ownership of goods such as refrigerators in beneficiary populations and thus, also on emissions. These studies provide evidence that, as poverty levels are lowered, and income levels are raised, individuals tend to change their consumption patterns and increase their energy use. Still, these studies do not address the relationship at a more aggregate level. Nor do they address the question of what global poverty eradication may mean for global environmental goals. At the cross-country and global levels, the relationship between poverty and emission levels has mainly been analyzed indirectly through separate frameworks. The poverty-growth-inequality triangle (Bourguignon, 2004 ) shows a non-linear relationship between poverty, income and inequality. Associations between emissions levels and income levels, on the other hand, have been represented in the environmental Kuznets curve and IPAT frameworks (Chertow, 2000 ; Stern, 2017 ). Within these latter frameworks, poverty reduction is implicitly considered a consequence of economic growth and rising average incomes (Dollar & Kraay, 2002 ). Following this reasoning, Woodward (2015)  concludes that economic growth cannot achieve poverty eradication within the constraints of global carbon goal budgets unless it is accompanied by unrealistic distributional improvements. Only recently has the direct relationship between poverty and the environment begun to be examined. In their study published in 2017, Hubacek and colleagues estimate the direct impact of poverty eradication on emission levels and consequent changes in temperatures. They assume the case that all individuals in extreme poverty (<US$1.90 a day) move beyond the poverty line and reach the average carbon footprint of the group consuming between US$1.90 and US$2.97 a day.8  8 They achieve this by estimating the carbon footprints of five income groups, through a combination of input output tables and household surveys.   They calculate that poverty eradication would imply an increase in mitigation rates from 4.4% to 4.5% per year up to 2100 to avoid an increase of 2 degrees in temperatures. On the other hand, if all people below US$2.97 a day were lifted to the next level (between US$2.97 and US$8.44 per day), the effect on emission levels would be substantial. In another recent study, O'Neill, Fanning, Lamb, and Steinberger (2018)  quantify the resource-use associated with meeting basic human needs. One of the basic human needs analyzed is poverty, for which the ratio between the amount of emissions needed and the environmental boundary (which they define as 1.6 tons of CO2  per year per capita) is 1.4.9  9 Therefore, around 2.24 tCO2  per capita.   As the aim of O'Neill et al. (2018)  is to look at different social and environmental dimensions at the present time, they do not focus on poverty and emissions specifically; nor do they look at time trends or at the total volume of emissions associated with the eradication of global poverty. Moreover, neither of these studies looks at the direct relationship between poverty and energy use, which mediates the relationship between poverty and emission levels. Some studies, however, have begun to address the issue of the direct relationship between emission levels and specific dimensions of poverty. Most of these studies focus on energy poverty (Casillas & Kammen, 2010 ; Chakravarty & Tavoni, 2013 ; Pachauri et al., 2013 ; Ürge-Vorsatz & Tirado Herrero, 2012 ). This enables the researchers to examine direct energy emissions at the household level, and not on the entire carbon footprint, as done by Hubacek et al. (2017) .10  10 Other papers estimate the increase and energy and emissions just for particular regions, such as Bazilian et al. (2012) .   Another strand of literature focuses on the direct relationship between emission levels and other measures of well-being, with special attention on life expectancy and literacy rates, showing that countries do not meet basic needs in an environmentally sustainable way (O'Neill et al., 2018 ; Rao, Riahi, & Grubler, 2014 ; Steinberger & Roberts, 2010 ). One important finding is the presence of a decoupling process, as countries have become more efficient in meeting human needs. Steinberger and Roberts (2010)  also estimate the thresholds linked to specific human development levels. These studies take advantage of the fact that, compared to poverty estimates, data on human development is available for a longer time period and for the same years across all countries. This is true especially for developing countries (Jean et al., 2016 ). In summary, Hubacek et al. (2017)  is the only study to date that focuses on, and estimates, the potential impact of poverty eradication on emission levels, also deriving the consequences for climate change mitigation. Nonetheless, their estimate (which assumes that individuals in poverty move above the poverty line through targeted cash transfers, while the rest of the population does not increase their emissions) indicates a lower bound. In fact, poverty eradication happens through a multitude of policies (Ravallion, 2016 ), which increase footprints and emission levels of the entire population and not just of the individuals in poverty. Therefore, it is of interest to estimate the impact on emission levels if countries follow the average poverty-emissions pathway. In the subsequent sections, such an estimation is developed and performed and then confronted with comparable estimates, such as O'Neill et al. (2018) .   Methods Methodology and framework The empirical analysis presented in this study aims at estimating the average poverty-energy-emissions pathway across both countries and time. This entails estimating the level of poverty associated, on average, with different levels of emissions and energy use, and vice versa. It is also of interest to study whether this average pathway has changed over time. As a result, this study also investigates what the potential effects on global emissions would be if poverty eradication is achieved and countries follow the current and historical estimated poverty-energy-emissions pathways. The research presented here is complementary to Hubacek et al. (2017) , which estimate the potential increase in global emissions (and related increase in global temperatures) derived by lifting all individuals  in poverty to an income level above the poverty line. This is relevant from a policy perspective as plans are implemented comprehensively at the national level. Poverty can be defined as pronounced deprivations in well-being or welfare (Barrientos, 2013 ). In this sense, it is essential to consider the relationship between poverty, rather than income levels, and emissions. In fact, increases in aggregate consumption do not necessarily translate into lower poverty rates, or higher levels of well-being in general. Therefore, if the aim is to achieve well-being, in the form of poverty eradication, within environmental limits, it is important to explore the direct relationship between poverty and emission levels, as well as the mediating relationship between poverty and energy use. The methodology used for the analysis can be divided into three steps. First, the average poverty-energy-emissions pathway is estimated by selecting the functional form that best fits the data.11  11 This is done my both using Stata's command curvefit and the command nl   As the relationship between poverty and both energy use and emission levels is not linear, special attention is given to the functional forms where, after a certain threshold, or closer to a saturation value, higher values of the independent variable x  are associated with diminishing returns for the dependent variable y . Among these functional forms, the generalized logistic is of special interest as it is linked to the work of Preston and the literature on environmental pressures and basic human needs (Steinberger & Roberts, 2010 ).12  12 The logistic regression represents an intuitive choice as the poverty headcount is bounded between 0 and 1(100).   The logistic equation is of the form(1) y = 100 1 + α ∗ e − βx        where y  represents non-poverty  (defined as the proportion of the population above the poverty line) and x  the emissions (energy use) per capita value. The assumption is that f ′ (x ) > 0, and f ′′ (x ) < 0 for higher levels of emissions (energy use). This generalized logistic function also allows the specification of the carrying capacity , defined as the maximum value that the dependent variable can take. In our case that is a poverty rate of 0% (and a non-poverty rate of 100%). This is relevant as many countries exhibit a poverty rate approximating zero. In the sample used in the analysis, the average poverty headcount rate (at US$1.90 a day poverty) for high-income countries is 0.6% (44 observations in the original sample have a poverty estimate of exactly 0%).13  13 Hubacek et al. (2017)  do not consider poverty in developed countries.   It should be noted that other functional forms are tried, and are found to exhibit a worse fit.14  14 The other function forms with special attention are (Steinberger & Roberts, 2010 ):y = α + β ln x     ln y sat  y  − 1   = α + β ln x     y = α + β ln x  + γ ln x  − ln x   ¯    2     ln y sat  − y   = α + β ln x      Where sat indicates the saturation value.   The methodology follows the existing literature; cross-country analysis is justified by the focus on the goals of poverty eradication and emission levels at the global level. Once the parameters of the preferred function are estimated, the average association between poverty, energy use and emission levels may be found. For example, the level of emissions (energy use) associated with the eradication of extreme poverty for the average country may be estimated. As a robustness test, the analysis also presents the median value of emission levels (energy use) for the countries closest to poverty eradication (O'Neill et al., 2018 ). For the purpose of this study, a poverty headcount ratio value that can be associated to poverty eradication needs to be defined in order to analyze its associations with emissions values. This choice is important given the steep shape of the logistic function. To address this issue, a poverty headcount of 5% is considered as the level related to poverty eradication; this was done so that small measurement errors do not significantly affect the analysis, following O'Neill et al. (2018) . Robustness checks are performed with threshold values of 0.6% (average of poverty headcount for high-income countries) and 3% (used by the World Bank as a target for 2030; F. H. G. Ferreira et al. (2016) ). In a second step the presence of a decoupling process is analyzed. This is achieved by comparing the functional form of the relationships over time. To address data comparability issues between time and countries, two methods are followed. First a restricted sample is selected, including countries with observations of both poverty and emission levels regarding ‘before’ and ‘after’ the year 2000. Second, the interpolated poverty estimates from the World Bank are used. The advantage of these interpolated data is their availability for all countries for the same years. The downside of using these estimates is their lower accuracy compared to values arising directly form household surveys. Nonetheless, they may be used to conduct a robustness check to analyze the presence of a decoupling process. In the third step, future scenarios are projected. Previous estimations are used to project the potential increase in emissions associated with poverty eradication in 2030.  Data The main poverty, inequality and mean income data (presented in US$ using 2011 PPPs) has been sourced from PovcalNet .15  15 http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/povOnDemand.aspx .   This source is used as the data are estimated from the most comprehensive collection of household surveys from developing countries. These data also allow the estimation of alternative poverty and inequality measures with different absolute poverty lines. One main drawback of this data source is the alternate use of consumption or income for different countries, which hinders comparability.16  16 There are other drawbacks in using these data (see Ravallion (2016) , for a detailed summary and explanations).   The main emissions data used in the analysis come from the Climate Analysis Indicators Tool (CAIT).17  17 http://cait.wri.org/ . CAIT data includes emissions from different sectors: energy, industrial processes, agriculture, waste and bunker fuels. And emissions for the energy sector are further divided into sub-sectors (electricity/heat, manufacturing/construction, transportation, other fuel combustion and fugitive emissions).   In accordance with the literature, estimates for CO2  emissions, excluding land-use change and forestry (LUCF hereafter), are the main indicators employed. These estimates date back to 1850. Although they capture similar emissions as CDIAC data, they are obtained in a different manner.18  18 http://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/ .   The data on CO2  emissions in the CAIT dataset, in fact, is drawn from multiple sources (CDIAC, IEA, UNFCC and EIA).19  19 IEA is the International Energy Agency. UNFCC is the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. EIA is the US Energy Information Administration.   This data captures emissions from energy and industrial processes, which include mainly CO2  emissions arising from fossil fuel combustion and cement manufacture (but also from other fuels, and natural gas flaring). While emissions from industrial processes (cement production) are sourced from CDIAC for all countries, data on fossil fuel combustion come from multiple sources (CAIT gives priority to IEA data from 1970). CAIT is used as a data source since it includes historical CO2  emissions and emissions from different sources, sectors, and pollutants.20  20 Another popular data source used is the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR), which distinguished between industrial and non-industrial emissions.   More specifically, a major advantage of CAIT data is the availability of estimates of GHG and CO2  emissions including LUCF (estimated from 1990 to 2012), which are employed in some of the quantitative analyses.21  21 As of December 2016. Compared to PovcalNet  data there are no estimates for Kosovo, Micronesia, South Sudan, Saint Lucia, Timor Leste, Tuvalu, West Bank and Gaza.   Since poverty eradication is the main focus of this study, it was important to test for the inclusion of emission sources closely linked to poverty reduction, such as agriculture and changes in land-use.22  22 Nonetheless the number of available estimates for CO2  (and GHG) emissions excluding LUCF is significantly greater than the one including LUCF. Robustness checks using CDIAC data are performed, as these data are widely used in the literature.   Nonetheless, in the analysis CO2  emissions excluding LUCF is employed. Emissions from fossil fuels are more strictly related to energy use, which is the other variable of interest (Steckel et al., 2013 ). For energy use, the data comes from the IEA and the World Development Indicators (World Bank, 2016 ), and is measured in annual tons of oil equivalent (toe) per capita of final energy use.23  23 Final and not primary energy is utilized. Studies (Steinberger & Roberts, 2010 ) suggest that conclusions would be similar.   The analysis focuses on extreme poverty (defined by a poverty line of US$1.90 a day), as it represents the first of the SDGs.24  24 “By 2030 , eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere , currently measured as people living on less than $1 .25 a day ”. The US$1.90 poverty line represents the update of the US$1.25 with new PPPs.   Attention will also be placed on the higher poverty line of US$3.10, as it represents the median poverty line for all developing countries (Hoy & Sumner, 2016 ).25  25 Estimates related to higher poverty lines employed in the literature are also included in the table presenting the summary statistics.   The use of different poverty lines is important because the trade-offs between (changes in) poverty and emissions might differ substantially at different poverty lines. On the other hand, as a comparative benchmark, the value of emissions per capita needed for 2030 to stay within the carbon budgets has been calculated using different alternatives. Rockström et al. (2017)  elaborate a “carbon law”, where CO2  emissions are halved every decade. Following this pathway, the value of 2030 emissions would be equal to 2.6 t CO2  per capita, compared to 4.9 in 2016. The second alternative is to use the remaining carbon budget until 2100 (IPCC) and a constant mitigation rate (as done by Hubacek et al. (2017)  and Jackson, Friedlingstein, Canadell, and Andrew (2015) ) to obtain the value of emissions required in 2030. In this case the value would need to be equal to 2.3 t CO2  per capita. A final estimate is given by O'Neill et al. (2018) , which indicate the planetary boundary as 1.61 tons of CO2  per year per capita.26  26 O'Neill et al. (2018)  assume 2011–2100 emissions distributed uniformly over time for the current population.   The second threshold (2.3tCO2 ) is used in the analysis as it represents the median value among the three outlined possibilities, and will be indicated as the level of “sustainable emissions ”.27  27 Previous papers have used a higher benchmark, such as a budget of 30Gt for 2030.    Descriptive statistics The initially derived dataset used in the analysis includes 1,186 observations from 149 countries between 1981 and 2012.28  28 This dataset is composed of a different number of observations for each of the 149 countries included in the sample; the mean is around 8 observations by country (see Fig. 1  in the Appendix A  for the distribution of frequencies).   The country-year observations that result from the merge of the different sourced datasets are those that include estimates for both poverty (and consequently mean income and inequality, as they come from the same surveys) and CO2  emission excluding LUCF. The initial inclusion of all available observations is followed because of the highly unbalanced nature of the panel; this imbalance makes it difficult to focus only on specific years. More importantly, the countries included in the dataset represent the near totality of global emissions and global poverty. For energy use there are fewer observations due to data availability (as recognized in the empirical literature). The main descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1  . The upper part of the table refers to the unweighted averages of the entire sample. The mean income is US$5,806 a year at 2011 PPPs, which amounts to US$484 a month.29  29 It should be noted that GDP per capita and expenditure estimates are significantly higher than mean incomes figures. The former categories include, in fact, additional components that are not captured in household surveys. This already sheds light on the importance of choosing which income variable to use. In the analysis mean income estimates from household surveys are employed, with expenditure-side and GDP per capita values used for robustness checks (as it is often done in the literature).   Average poverty headcounts are 13% and 24%, for the poverty lines previously defined (US$ 1.90 and US$ 3.10 a day respectively). Turning to inequality, the average value of the Gini coefficient in the sample is around 40, with the maximum estimate of 66 and the minimum close to 16. However, the sample exhibits variation, with a standard deviation of >10 points. Finally, the average emissions per capita estimate (expressed in metric tons per capita of CO2  equivalent) is 4.44, while energy use is 2.12 tons of oil equivalent (toe) per capita. In sum, the sample exhibits a low (compared to developed and rich countries) per capita income. All variables show high variance, however. This is especially the case for the inequality estimates. This heterogeneity derives from the fact that the sample represents most of the countries in the world. The lower part of Table 1  presents the descriptive statistics of the sample including the latest observation for all the 149 countries (the average year of the most recent observation is 2010). The unweighted means resemble the statistics previously outlined for the complete sample, with better socio-economic outcomes and lower emissions.   Results Fig. 1   represents the graphical relationship, for the full sample, between emissions per capita (excluding LUCF) and the poverty headcount (at US$ 1.90 a day), in absolute values (left-hand side of the figure) and logarithms (right-hand side). This is performed to give an initial indication of the pathway followed by countries. The red lines in the figure represent the lowess , which provides locally weighted scatter plot smoothing.30  30 Lowess  is a desirable smoother because of its locality it tends to follow the data. Polynomial smoothing methods, for instance, are global in that what happens on the extreme left of a scatter plot can affect the fitted values on the extreme right.   The figure shows that, after a certain emissions per capita value, the strong initial relationship between higher emissions and lower poverty flattens out: increases in emissions are not associated with respective reductions in the poverty headcount.31  31 The association between poverty and emissions is higher when CAIT  data is used. This is because CDIAC  estimates include just emissions from fossil fuel burning.   This can be described as diminishing returns to emissions for the level of poverty. It may also be represented by a saturation effect. This is due in part to the fact that the poverty headcount is bounded between 0 and 100, and, therefore, once it gets to 0, it cannot decrease further. However, this is not the only reason. It is clear that diminishing returns of emissions are evident before poverty reaches zero.32  32 A similar argument has also been underlined in the context of the relationship between income (as opposed to emissions) growth and poverty reduction (Sumner, 2016 ).   The use of logarithms confirms these findings as the curve becomes flatter for high levels of emissions. One point to note is the high variance, as some countries are performing much worse than others.33  33 Similar results are obtained when the estimates of per capita emissions including LUCF are considered. The only difference is that many countries with high forest cover exhibit lower (if not negative) emission values.   Current poverty-emissions pathway In estimating the current poverty-emissions pathway, the latest observation for each country is used.34  34 Compared to O'Neill et al. (2018)  this study considers more countries.   Moreover, when estimating the functional form, the share of the population above the poverty line (calculated as one minus the poverty headcount ratio; non-poverty) is used as it is a better fit compared to the poverty headcount. The R-squared values for the relationship between non-poverty and emissions are, in fact, significantly higher compared to when poverty is used. Moreover, the use of non-poverty makes it easier to compare the findings with previous studies.35  35 Non-poverty can be conceptualized as an indicator of well-being, similarly to the indicators used by Steinberger and Roberts (2010)  and the related literature.   The goodness of fit of different functional forms is documented in Table A1  presented in the Appendix A . In general, the non-linear forms fit the data better than the linear forms. As expected, the generalized logistic function has a very high adjusted R-squared value of between 98% and 100%, similar or higher than the others, and is chosen for its characteristics outlined in Methods.36  36 Four countries have been excluded as outliers: Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, South Africa and Suriname. This is partially due to the fact that surveys from eastern Europe are deemed sometimes as not comparable (F. Ferreira & Ravallion, 2009 ).   Moreover the generalized logistic function represents a better fit especially for lower values of non-poverty and emissions (due to the steepness of the curve), which is the focus of the analysis. The high goodness of fit value further justifies the use of the best fit functional form to describe the relationship. It can be said that countries do not significantly differ from the average pathway. Fig. 2   plots the observations and the average pathway, using the parameters estimated from the generalized logistic function, when the poverty line of US$1.90 a day is used.37  37 Same as previous footnote.   The upper part of the figure shows the unweighted average pathway (red line) as well as the weighted pathway by population size (blue dashed line). The weighted pathway can be thought of as representing the pathway of the average world citizen; it is used in previous studies (Steinberger & Roberts, 2010 ). As the weighted pathway lies below the unweighted one, it means that populous countries (China and India, for example, as indicated in the figure) are performing worse compared to the average. Using the estimated parameters from the generalized logistic function, it is also possible to calculate the average emissions per capita associated with specific levels of poverty. Headcount rates of 0.6%, 3% and 5% are associated with, respectively, 2.57, 1.78 and 1.52 tCO2  per capita per year. If the observations are weighted by country population sizes, the estimated tCO2  per capita values are 5.21, 3.48 and 2.92 respectively. The lower part of Fig. 2  represents the same country-year observations as the upper part of the figure, but divides the countries into income levels defined by the World Bank.38  38 The classification of income groups is taken from the World Bank.   This is performed in order to see whether income drives the relationship between emission levels and poverty. This finding is partially confirmed. Low-income countries have very low emissions and non-poverty rates ranging from 20 to 85%. Lower middle-income countries are characterized by higher non-poverty rates associated with low emissions. Upper middle-income countries are the most heterogeneous group, while high-income countries are characterized by very low poverty rates (close to zero), but different per capita emission levels. It seems therefore that, in some circumstances, the three dimensions of sustainable development (social, economic and environmental) are achieved jointly. To explore these findings, the quadrants inside the figures highlight only the countries that have achieved low poverty rates (non-poverty of 90% or higher), with sustainable emissions. It can be said that these countries are mainly from Latin America and Asia, with Cambodia, Bhutan and Sri Lanka performing the best. Moreover, this group is entirely represented by (lower and upper) middle-income countries. Conversely, some countries perform significantly worse than the average. For example, Venezuela and Saint Lucia lie to the bottom right of the estimated pathway. Fig. A2  in the Appendix A  represents the same analysis (estimating the generalized logistic function) for the case of the poverty line of US$3.10 a day. Fig. A2  shows that no county achieved poverty eradication within sustainable emissions. Fig. 3   presents an analogous analysis for energy use. Results are qualitatively similar to the results with emissions. One country exhibits a lot of more energy use than the rest (Iceland).39  39 A picture of the energy situation in Iceland is given by Atlason (2018) .   Also in this case, the weighted functions lie below the unweighted ones due to the worse performance of populous countries, such as China and India. Table 2   presents a summary of the above findings. The table also presents the estimated non-poverty values associated with sustainable emissions  (2.3 tCO2  per capita per year, as previously defined). On average, the US$1.90 a day poverty rate40  40 Headcount ratio.   associated with sustainable emissions is low (8.9% in the case of the weighted estimates, 1.1% in the case of unweighted estimates). By contrast the same poverty rates when measured at the US$3.10 a day poverty line are significantly higher especially in the case of weighted estimates. How does this compare with previous research on other human development and well-being dimensions? Steinberger and Roberts (2010)  estimate that a life expectancy of 70 years (indicated as a well-being threshold) was associated with 2.2 tons of CO2  emissions in 2005. This value was higher compared to the one associated with literacy rates of 80% (1.8 tons).41  41 These values are also in line with O'Neill et al. (2018) .   By contrast, high GDP per capita (US$10,000 a year) and HDI thresholds require higher emissions, of around 3.7 tons of carbon.42  42 As they use tons of carbon, the value of tons of CO2  has been obtained dividing their estimate by 0.27.   Considering energy use, high life expectancy and high HDI values were associated respectively with around 40 GJ and 60 GJ in 2005.43  43 As 1 toe = 41.868 GJ, 40 GJ corresponds to slightly <1 toe.   Therefore the results from the present study show that a low value of poverty (5% or 3%) yields similar results (when using the unweighted averages), as Steinberger and Roberts (2010) ; while a poverty value of 0.6% is associated with nearly twice as much energy and emission levels.  Decoupling process In order to analyze the feasibility of eradicating global poverty within environmental boundaries by 2030, it is necessary to complement a static analysis of the current pathway with an investigation of how this relationship changes over time. Is it possible, for example, that over time, the same emission levels may be associated with lower poverty levels? Even further, if this process is strong enough and a new path of development is followed, might it be possible to achieve poverty eradication with sustainable emissions by 2030? Decoupling may be defined as the dissociation between two variables over time (Gupta, 2015 ). In this study, the two variables examined are emission levels and poverty eradication. The decoupling factor between t 0 and t 1 is calculated as the percentage change in the emission levels associated with poverty eradication:Dec  Factor = CO 2  emissions    poverty = x   t 1   CO 2  emissions   poverty = x   t 0    − 1    where x  is the threshold value of poverty eradication previously defined, equal to three possible values: 0.6%, 3%, and 5%. For the analysis, two different samples are used. First, a restricted sample is obtained by selecting countries with observations from both before and after 2000.44  44 For comparability reasons, the same four countries of the previous section (Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, South Africa and Suriname) are excluded. In addition, separate regressions are performed without China and Venezuela that appear to be outliers in this restricted sample, but the results do not change significantly.   The full methodology and the descriptive statistics of this restricted sample are not presented here for reasons of space. A comparison of the estimated trajectories between the two periods (1981–1999 and 2000–2012) is presented in Fig. 4   for emissions (and Fig. A3  for energy use). The upper side shows the estimated relationship for the unweighted regression, for the pre (black dashed line) and post 2000 (red line) periods. The bottom side presents the case of the weighted pathway. Both figures show that the curve shifts upwards, indicating that a decoupling process has taken place.45  45 Nonetheless the confidence intervals intersect; therefore, the decoupling process is not statistically significant at the 95% level. Of course, this could be the result of data issues as previously described.   Yet, as in the previous section, weighted pathways perform worse than the unweighted ones. This means that populous countries performed worse than smaller nations. The upper right-hand quadrant of Fig. 4  presents the changes followed by populous countries (given their relevance for global poverty and climate change). Some countries (e.g. Indonesia and Bangladesh) have significantly decreased poverty with relatively low increases in emissions. China, on the other hand, has witnessed improvements in poverty at the expense of the environment. The upper right-hand quadrant of Fig. 4  also shows clearly how the pathway followed by China lies at the right (and below) the pathways followed by other countries. How significant is this decoupling? Table 3   presents the estimated values quantifying the decoupling process. The decrease in the emission levels associated with near complete poverty eradication (0.6% poverty rate), in the case of a poverty line of US$1.90, is 2.24% annually; similar values are found for poverty levels of 3% and 5% (decoupling of 2.38% and 2.45% respectively).46  46 The non-poverty rate associated with 2.3 t CO2  per capita has increased with an annual compound growth of 0.29%.   On the other hand, the decoupling process has been less significant for energy use, with decoupling values ranging between 0.31% and 0.83%. In order to confirm the existence of a decoupling process, given the data issues previously described, an alternative sample is used. Specifically, the interpolated poverty estimates given by PovcalNet  are employed.47  47 These estimates are given by PovcalNet  directly.   The advantage of these estimates is that data are available for the same years for all countries. The availability of poverty estimates for certain years at regular intervals makes it possible to analyze in which specific periods the decoupling process has taken place. The main drawbacks of using this data are that interpolated estimates are less accurate than the values derived directly from household surveys. Given these limitations, Fig. A4  in the Appendix A  is not entirely comparable with Figs. 3 and A3 . Nonetheless, even when considering interpolated data, a decoupling process is evident. More importantly, Fig. A4  shows that, when considering emissions, the decoupling process has taken place mainly over the last 10 years. In fact, while the curves for 1981, 1990 and 2002 are very close to each other, the curve related to 2012 is significantly higher. Again, for energy, the figure shows that no decoupling has occurred. Therefore, the use of interpolated poverty data confirms that the decoupling process is more significant for emission levels than for energy use. How do these results relate to previous research on decoupling between emission levels and other indicators of well-being? Calculating the compound proportional changes from the estimates presented in Steinberger and Roberts (2010) , the decoupling of emissions from GDP, HDI and literacy presents values similar to the ones found for poverty in this study (respectively 2.3%, 2.7% and 1.9%). On the other hand, average life expectancy has decoupled faster, at a rate of around 4.3%. Steinberger and Roberts (2010)  also found that the decoupling process was more significant for emissions compared to energy use. Therefore, it can be said the estimated decoupling process between poverty and emission levels is comparable to what has been estimated using alternative well-being indicators.  Decoupling process: possible explanations Given the evidence that a decoupling process is present, some possible explanations may be advanced. In doing so, it is important to note that, if current trends continue, similar values of decoupling may continue. However, it is beyond the scope of this study to perform a statistical decomposition or an econometric analysis of the factors that determine the decoupling process; such an analysis would require a complex modeling exercise (O'Neill et al., 2018 ).48  48 This is especially true given the non-linear relationship under consideration.   A reasonable starting point is the argument that income levels and inequality are strong determinants of both (absolute) poverty and emission levels across countries (Adams, 2004 ; Grunewald, Klasen, Martínez-Zarzoso, & Muris, 2017 ). Therefore, a decoupling process may arise from two different mechanisms. A first mechanism happens when economic growth reduces poverty but does not increase (proportionally) emissions and energy use. This mechanism is represented by a decrease in the emissions intensity of GDP (defined as the kg's of CO2  equivalent per 2011 PPP $ of GDP). Using estimates from the World Development Indicators  (World Bank, 2016 ), the global value of the emissions intensity of GDP decreased from 0.48 in 1990 to 0.34 in 2014. A decreasing trend is also found for many populous and relevant (in terms of global emissions and poverty) developing countries. In particular, China's emissions intensity value decreased from 1.41 to 0.59, while India witnessed a less significant decrease, from 0.41 to 0.32. Conversely, a small group of countries showed no improvement and, in some cases, even increased their value for the emissions intensity of GDP. These are mainly low-income countries at the initial stages of development, but include also populous middle-income countries (i.e. Bangladesh, Brazil and Indonesia). The emissions intensity of GDP can be further decomposed into two components (see Fig. A5  in the Appendix A ). The first is the energy intensity of GDP (kg of oil equivalent per $1000 of GDP, 2011 PPPs), which has shown a similar trend to that of the emissions intensity. The second component is the carbon intensity of energy (kg per kg of oil equivalent energy use). This component has shown decreases for middle- and high-income countries since 2011. Such trends suggest that the de‑carbonization of energy systems may be a significant driver of further reductions in emission levels. A second mechanism explaining the decoupling process is a better redistribution of resources, meaning that the same economic (and environmental) output corresponds to lower poverty levels. This mechanism may be represented by the use of redistributive policies, such as direct antipoverty cash transfers (Barrientos, 2013 ). These programs tackle poverty addressing inequality rather than through economic growth. They have been found to be efficient in reducing poverty, as the small budget share represented by these programs normally corresponds to a significant decrease in poverty (Soares, Ribas, & Osório, 2010 ). Cash transfer programs became popular in Latin America in the 1990s and have since been implemented in many developing countries (Barrientos, 2013 ; Honorati, Gentilini, & Yemtsov, 2015 ). A recent database puts the number of cash transfer programs for the poor in developing countries equal to 223 in 2015, compared to 89 in 2000 (Barrientos, 2018 ).49  49 Defined as social assistance. See Fig. A6  in the Appendix A .   Especially relevant is the use of these policies as complements to fossil fuel subsidy withdrawals and carbon taxes, as this combination of policies may deliver direct win-win situations for social and climate outcomes (Hoy & Sumner, 2016 ; Jakob et al., 2014 ).50  50 One issue that could arise is the environmental paradox of the welfare state (Bailey, 2015 ), where less growth means also less resources for the government.   Although further research is needed in this area, in general terms the use of cash transfers has proven to be an effective tool in the fight against poverty. As both trends (lower emissions intensity of GDP and the use of antipoverty transfers) continue over time, it is reasonable to assume that the decoupling process of emissions and poverty described in the previous section will continue.  Future perspectives: poverty eradication and climate mitigation by 2030 What do the previous findings mean for the goals of poverty eradication within the cumulative carbon budget until 2030, when the current SDGs expire? This question is addressed in several steps, by projecting and comparing alternative scenarios and by applying the coefficients estimated in the previous sections. First, two main scenarios are developed. The first scenario is a pessimistic one, where no further decoupling takes place. This means that the current pathway (Current poverty-emissions pathway  section) remains through 2030. The optimistic scenario, on the other hand, assumes that the estimated current decoupling process (annual decreases of emission levels associated with poverty eradication  estimated in Decoupling process: possible explanations  section) continues until 2030.51  51 See Fig. A7  in the Appendix A .   This would mean that poverty eradication (0.6%) would be associated, on average, with 1.9 tons of CO2  emissions per capita in 2030, compared to the current estimate of 2.6.52  52 In the case of the unweighted trajectory; the weighted estimate is of 3.6, compared to the current 5.2. The values relate to the poverty line of US$ 1.90 a day.   Given the trends seen in the Decoupling process: possible explanations  section, this is the most likely scenario at the moment. Moreover, by focusing on the relationship between the ultimate goals of emissions and poverty, this section also assumes that the relationship between poverty and energy use follows the pathways presented in the Current poverty-emissions pathway  section and Decoupling process: possible explanations  section. The second step is to quantify the potential impact of poverty eradication on emission levels for the different scenarios. To do this, the “emissions gap ” is defined as the difference between the actual emissions level of each country and the one associated, on average, with poverty eradication. For countries experiencing no poverty, the emissions gap is set to zero. The “total emissions gap ”, therefore, is the sum of the emissions gaps for all countries, multiplied by their respective population sizes. Estimates of the total emissions gap (in absolute and percentage increases compared to the 2016 baseline) are presented in the first two columns of Table 4  . The first row of the table presents the case of the pessimistic scenario, previously described. The findings show that the total emissions gap would result in a 22% increase in emissions compared to 2016.53  53 These values are estimated including projected population growth for each country.   The optimistic scenario, presented in the second row, would signify a 12% increase. If it is assumed that this increase in emissions is linear over time between 2017 and 2030, the mitigation rates needed to stay within the 2 °C temperature increase are 4.7% in the optimistic scenario, and 5.1% in the pessimistic one. These figures compare to the 4.4% mitigation rate needed with current emissions (with no additional emissions from poverty eradication). These projections estimate the level and quantity of emissions that would be needed to eradicate poverty if countries follow the average poverty-emissions pathway. How do these estimates compare to existing studies that focus on different policies to eradicate poverty? Hubacek et al. (2017)  examine the case in which poverty reduction is achieved through redistributive policies alone. They estimate an increase in emissions of 0.7%, and mitigation rates of 4.5%. Their estimate of emissions increases is much lower than the one found in this study, as they assume that the individuals above the poverty line witness no change in their consumption. On the other hand, the estimates in this study consider a poverty-emissions pathway, in which individuals above the poverty line also increase their emissions as countries move along the pathway. A further comparison may be made with studies that estimate increases in emissions due to access to modern energy for all (see Table A3  in the Appendix A ). The estimates presented in these studies are not directly comparable with the estimates presented in the current study as they consider only a single dimension of poverty eradication (energy access) and not the entire carbon footprint. However, it is interesting to note that they follow the same approach used here since they do not assume that the eradication of energy poverty is achieved only through the use of targeted policies. The main conclusion to be drawn by comparing the findings presented in the current study with those of previous work is that eradicating poverty through direct cash transfers seems to be significantly more efficient from an emissions point of view. This provides strong support for the view that pursuing incremental changes and improvements in carbon and energy intensities (symbolized by the current decoupling process) is not enough. A second conclusion is that the estimated increases in emissions may be able to be offset by decreases in emissions in the highest emitting countries. Hubacek et al. (2017) , for example, show that countries with income levels above US$ 23.03 a day (10% highest income earners) have an average annual footprint of 26.3 t CO2  per capita and represent 36% of total emissions. This finding is supported by other work (Chakravarty et al., 2009 ; Chancel & Piketty, 2015 ). Therefore, the possible additional environmental pressures caused by poverty eradication are negligible in relation to the one currently induced by middle-, and especially high-, income classes.   Conclusions and policy implications This study has explored the question of what the eradication of poverty would mean in terms of global emissions, considering the cross-country poverty-energy-emissions pathway. The analysis presented fills a relevant gap in the literature in which poverty and the environment have traditionally been treated as separate issues. More specifically, extant empirical studies on these two crucial policy issues make few connections between them. The objective of this study, therefore, was to conduct an empirical analysis of the relationship between poverty and emission levels across countries and over time. This study also sought to examine this relationship by looking at the crucial role of energy use. The findings of this study may be summarized as follows. First, a significant trade-off exists between (absolute) poverty and per capita emission levels. This relationship may be described by a pathway where poverty decreases fast at low levels of emissions, and flattens out after a certain level of emissions. This is similar to the relationship found in the literature between per capita emissions and other human development indicators (such as life expectancy or literacy rates). The estimated average poverty-emissions pathway also shows that the level of per capita emissions associated, on average, with the eradication of poverty for the average country is low compared to the emission levels of high-income countries. A similar pathway is found for the relationship between poverty and energy use. Second, the results of this study show that the relationship between non-poverty and emissions has become more efficient over time, i.e. lower levels of poverty may be reached with fewer emissions. Therefore, a decoupling process has taken place, especially since 2000. However, the process is still very slow and more work needs to be done to accelerate this process. On the other hand, limited signs of a decoupling process between poverty levels and energy use are evident. This suggests that a minimum level of energy is required to meet basic needs. And, that significant future decoupling between energy and poverty levels should not be expected. Finally, implications for the feasibility of extreme poverty eradication by 2030 (SDG1) within the carbon budget have been analyzed. The findings suggest that, if the current poverty-emissions pathway remains constant throughout 2030, there will be a 22% increase in annual emissions; this would mean a mitigation rate higher than 5% per year through 2030. On the other hand, if the current decoupling process is continued until 2030, eradicating poverty following the poverty emissions pathway would imply a 12% increase in emissions compared to 2015. The comparison with previous research also suggests that eradicating poverty by the use of targeted antipoverty interventions is significantly more environmentally efficient. More specifically, targeting the global poor with cash transfers to lift them above the poverty line would increase emissions by only 0.7%. What are the other policy implications of the study?54  54 A final implication for future research is that, to better understand the cross-country relationship between poverty and the environment, improved poverty estimates are needed, in terms of both more frequent and comparable household surveys in developing countries and the use different data sources to complement traditional household surveys (Jean et al., 2016 ).   The first point to make is that, following current development pathways, eradicating poverty would mean a significant increase in emissions. A much lower increase would be associated with poverty reduction if the estimated decoupling process is followed. Especially in the latter and more positive scenario, the increase necessary to eradicate poverty could potentially be offset by decreases in emissions of high-income (and emitting) countries. A second policy implication is that, while improvements may be achieved in relation to both energy and emissions intensities, de‑carbonization of the energy systems may be used to achieve climate goals in more significant ways. The current analysis, in fact, provides further evidence that a minimum level of energy is required to satisfy human needs and that improvements in energy efficiency are limited. This is especially true for developing countries that need energy to build required infrastructure (Steckel et al., 2013 ). Therefore, climate scenarios need to consider that much of the mitigation in emission levels will need to be achieved in the carbon intensity of energy in low- and middle-income economies. A third policy implication, is that, as mentioned in the previous section concerning the results, using targeted antipoverty policies may be significantly more efficient than following the average development path for achieving environmental goals. Still, it is necessary to ask whether low and middle-income countries will be able to reduce poverty through targeted policies? Studies suggest that many countries already have the capacity to fill the poverty gap by diverting fossil fuel subsidies towards social assistance (direct cash transfers to the poor) (Hoy & Sumner, 2016 ). To underline this point, Table A4  in the Appendix A  presents the size of the poverty gap in many countries compared to the amounts these countries spend on fossil fuels and the amount they spend on social expenditures and cash transfers (as percentages of total GDP). For many countries, the amount spent on fossil fuel subsidies is higher than the amount required to fill the poverty gap. This amount is also significantly higher than the amount spent on social assistance. A case may be made, therefore, for diverting fossil fuel subsidies towards antipoverty transfers. This is especially true for large middle-income countries and emerging economies that constitute the majority of global poverty and emissions. It is important to note, however, that a necessary step for any pathway to eradicate global poverty within environmental boundaries involves high-income countries decreasing their environmental pressure. In conclusion this study provides evidence of the direct average relationship between emissions and poverty levels in order to draw environmental implications for the goal of global poverty eradication. As an avenue for further research, the general picture presented in this study needs to be complemented by more specific country case studies in order to better understand the factors that impact the particular performance of both over- and under-achieving countries. Such work, combined with the more general findings of the current study, would provide a basis for specific practical and policy oriented advice.

This is because LPG stoves are about four times more efficient than biomass stoves, and hence, require less input energy to provide the same amount of useful energy for cooking.”    Table A4 Table with expenditure in social assistance, subsidies and poverty gap.
