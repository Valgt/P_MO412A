                  We use two indices for measuring the progress and performance of 20 sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries in meeting four industry-related Sustainable Development Goal 9 (SDG-9) targets and their associated five indicators, which are: manufacturing value added as a proportion of gross domestic product, manufacturing value added per capita, manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment, carbon dioxide emissions per unit of manufacturing value added and the proportion of medium- and high-tech value added in manufacturing value added. Both indices, SDG-9 progress and SDG-9 performance, are based on the same data but are constructed using different methodologies. The integration of these two SSA focused indices is the basis for classifying countries as either active or passive and as either leading or lagging. Combining the four country groupings with a policy option matrix demonstrates the heuristic value for common comparator countries of using different index findings to initiate policy dialogue and stimulate public discussion about policy domains needing the most attention.

Industry-related sustainable development Goal-9 progress and performance indices and policies for Sub-Saharan African countries Ralph A. Luken ∗   Abu Saieed  Michelle Magvasi  United Nations Industrial Development Organization, Austria United Nations Industrial Development Organization Austria  United Nations Industrial Development Organization, Austria  ∗ Corresponding author.      We use two indices for measuring the progress and performance of 20 sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries in meeting four industry-related Sustainable Development Goal 9 (SDG-9) targets and their associated five indicators, which are: manufacturing value added as a proportion of gross domestic product, manufacturing value added per capita, manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment, carbon dioxide emissions per unit of manufacturing value added and the proportion of medium- and high-tech value added in manufacturing value added. Both indices, SDG-9 progress and SDG-9 performance, are based on the same data but are constructed using different methodologies. The integration of these two SSA focused indices is the basis for classifying countries as either active or passive and as either leading or lagging. Combining the four country groupings with a policy option matrix demonstrates the heuristic value for common comparator countries of using different index findings to initiate policy dialogue and stimulate public discussion about policy domains needing the most attention.   Keywords Sustainable development goals  SDG-9 targets  Progress index  Performance index  Sub-Saharan Africa  Industry    1 Introduction The UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 70/1, “Transforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, and so put economic development on the global development agenda. At the core of the new development agenda are 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (UN General Assembly, 2015 ). Among the 17 SDGs, five address economic development and environmental concerns, whereas other goals address social, political, and agricultural development (UN ECOSOC, 2016 ). Goal 9, which includes infrastructure, industry, and innovation targets, sees industry (herein defined as manufacturing) as the engine for job creation and economic growth. Within Goal 9, there are eight targets. Only four of these targets and their five associated indicators are considered in this paper because they will be significantly affected by industrial development and are assigned to the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) as the custodian agency (Appendix A ). Because benchmarking country progress with these four targets and their five different indicators is difficult, policy analysts prefer a single dimensional composite index that captures the multidimensionality of sustainable industrial development. Composite indices, correctly constructed, facilitate the interpretation of many separate indicators by reducing the set of indicators without losing significant underlying variable information into a single index. They make it easier to assess country performance or progress compared to identifying common trends across many separate indicators, which can assist in initiating policy dialogue. For composite indices to measure performance or progress, there needs to be enough indicators to capture multidimensionality but limited in number for ease of presentation in public presentations and to avoid misinterpretation (OECD, 2008 ). Our research has three objectives: (a) to apply performance and progress composite indices using industry-relevant SDG-9 indicators for 20 out of 49 sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries for which there are sufficient data; (b) to compare country performance and progress for 20 SSA countries based on these two composite indices; (c) and to identify policy recommendations for each of the 20 SSA countries based on their performance and progress on specific indicators. The remainder of this article consists of seven additional sections. Section Two reviews existing composite indices that have the potential to encompass all three dimensions of sustainable industrial development – economic, social, and environmental. Section Three describes the indicator database used to estimate both performance and progress composite indices for the 20 SSA countries. Section Four describes two known composite index methodologies – performance and progress – that can assess achievements in meeting industry-related targets. Section Five shows the rankings of 20 SSA countries based on both composite indices. Section Six integrates the rankings of the two indices. Section Seven illustrates the potential of the two indices’ findings for initiating policy dialogue and stimulating public discussion. Section Eight concludes the article.  2 Literature review We found only a limited number of articles and reports that, in varying degrees, benchmark global progress in meeting SDG targets. These reports are described below: The Partnership for Action on Green Economy (PAGE, 2017a ) constructs a measurement framework that estimates the progress in achieving the transition to an inclusive green economy at the national and global levels. This measurement framework includes a composite index, the Green Economy Progress (GEP) index, as well as a ‘dashboard’ of indicators. The GEP index captures characteristics of a green economy by including multidimensional indicators, such as measures that link health and the environment. It aggregates 13 multidimensional indicators to measure the progress of 105 countries with respect to their own targets and tracks the sustainability of that progress between two points in time, 2004 and 2014. Only 12 of the 20 SSA countries in our analysis are included in the GEP. Among the countries ranked in 2014 across all 13 indicators, Namibia, Cameroon, and Mozambique are at the top, whereas Botswana, Côte d'Ivoire, and South Africa are at the bottom. Despite its name, none of the 13 indicators or sub-indicators in the GEP index are SDG-9 industry-relevant economic, social (employment), or environmental variables. More recently, the GEP methodology has been used to construct an index for measuring country progress in meeting SDG-7 (energy) targets (Herrero et al., 2020 ). The World Economic Forum constructs an Inclusive Development Index (IDI) for 103 countries as of 2016. It is designed as an alternative to Gross Domestic Product (GDP), because it is said to reflect more closely the criteria by which people evaluate their country's progress (WEF, 2018 ). The IDI index has three pillars: growth and development, inclusion and intergenerational equity, and sustainability, as well as four key national performance indicators under each pillar. It includes an overall IDI score and a five-year trend for each country. Only 10 of the 20 SSA countries in our analysis are included in the IDI. Among the countries ranked in 2016, U.R. Tanzania, Ghana, and Cameroon are the top three, whereas South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique are the bottom three. The IDI does not include sector-specific data (for instance manufacturing), and only includes one SDG environmental indicator, carbon dioxide (CO2 ) per unit of GDP, but not CO2  per unit of manufacturing value added (MVA). Sachs et al. (2018)  construct an SDG Index and Dashboard (SDGI) for 156 countries as of 2017. The SDG Index is based on 88 indicators for the 17 SDG goals with additional indicators for OECD countries. The 88 indicators differ significantly from those for the 17 SDGs. The authors compute their SDGI by first estimating scores for each goal using the arithmetic mean of indicators for that goal and then average across all 17 SDGs to obtain their SDGI score. The global SDGI score and scores by goal can be interpreted as a percentage of achievement. The difference between 100 and countries’ scores is therefore the distance from their SDG targets. Of the 20 SSA countries, 19 are included in the SDGI index. Among the countries ranked in 2017, Mauritius, Ghana, and Gabon are the top three, whereas Niger, Nigeria, and Congo are the bottom three. The SDGI excludes those indicators where quantitative thresholds are not applicable for all countries. For this reason, none of the industry-relevant SDG-9 indicators are among the 88 indicators in their SDGI. UNIDO constructed for the first time, and on an experimental basis, a CO2 -Adjusted Competitive Industrial Performance Index (CO2 -Adjusted CIP) for 123 countries as a complement to its Competitive Industrial Performance Index (CIP) for 150 economies as of 2016 (UNIDO, 2019a ). The CO2 -Adjusted CIP index builds on the three main dimensions of the CIP by adding CO2  emission data from the International Energy Agency (IEA). All 20 SSA countries included in our analysis are included in the CO2 -Adjusted CIP index. Among the countries ranked in 2016, Botswana, Nigeria, and South Africa are the top three, whereas Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Namibia are the bottom three. The index has no indicator for manufacturing employment. Lin et al. (2019)  construct an Inclusive Sustainable Transformation (IST) index for more than 200 countries over a 15-year period (2000–2015). This index distinguishes itself from other indices that track the structural characteristics of the economy by ensuring that the comparisons among countries account for differences in their level of development. The primary data sources are two SDG reports monitoring: Indicators and a Monitoring Framework for the SDGs (SDSN, 2015 ) and the report of the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (UN ECOSOC, 2016 ) supplemented by other sources. They expand the country dataset by using multiple imputation techniques. The index includes 27 indicators of which four are identical to the industry-relevant SDG-9 indicators. All 20 SSA countries included in our analysis are included in the IST index. Among the 20 SSA countries ranked in 2015, Kenya, Ghana, and Eritrea are the top three, whereas Nigeria, U.R. Tanzania, and Angola are the bottom three. Only the CO2  indicator differs from the industry-relevant SDG-9 in that it is CO2  emission intensity per GDP. Biggeri et al. (2019)  construct an Integrated Sustainable Development Index (I-SDI) for the same period (as of 2017) and same countries (156 countries) as Sachs et al. (2018) . The authors acknowledge the contribution of Sachs et al. but correctly state that the SDGI has the well-known problem of an arithmetic mean (perfect substitution between dimensions). They construct an adjusted I-SDI, creating a new aggregation based on the Multidimensional Synthesis of Indicators approach, which considers trade-offs and synergies between goals and targets across all three dimensions of sustainable development. Their approach avoids problems using arithmetic and geometric means. The authors compare their ranking with both arithmetic and geometric mean rankings of countries and find crucial differences. Only 8 of the 20 SSA countries in our analysis are included in the I-SDI index. Among the countries ranked in 2017, Ghana, Gabon, and South Africa are the top three, whereas Angola, Nigeria, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are the bottom three. The index, using the same data as Sachs et al. (2018) , means that the I-SDI index does not include industry-relevant SDG-9 indicators. Moll de Alba and Todorov (2020)  construct a Green Industrial Performance (GIP) index that encompasses 107 countries as of 2015 in terms of green manufacturing. Their three-dimensional indicators consist of (i) the capacity to produce and export green manufactures (green MVA per capita and green exports per capita), (ii) the importance of green manufacturing (share of green MVA in total MVA and share of green manufactured exports in total exports), and (iii) the social and environmental aspects of green manufacturing (share of green manufacturing employment in total manufacturing employment and CO2  emissions from manufacturing per unit of MVA). Only 10 of the 20 SSA countries in our analysis are included in the GIP index. Among the SSA countries ranked in 2015, South Africa, Ghana, and Cameroon are the top three, whereas Nigeria, Kenya and Botswana are the bottom three. While the index is an industry-relevant index, it includes only one of the seven SDG-9 industry-relevant indicators: CO2  emissions per unit of MVA. Kynčlová et al. (2020)  construct an SDG-9 performance (SDG-9Per) index for 128 economies over the period 2000–2016. SDG-9Per is a performance index that measures the level of achievement at a point in time on the five industry-relevant SDG-9 indicators. These include MVA as a proportion of GDP, per capita MVA, manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment, CO2  emissions per unit of MVA, and proportion of medium- and high-tech industry value added in total MVA. Sufficient data are not yet available for the two remaining indicators, the proportion of small-scale industries in MVA and the proportion of small-scale industries with a loan or line of credit. The index is constructed as a geometric mean using equal weights for each indicator. All 20 SSA countries in our analysis are included in their index. Among the countries ranked in 2016, South Africa, Mauritius and Nigeria are at the top three, whereas Ghana, Eritrea, and Niger rank the bottom three. SDG-9Per is one of two among the ten indices reviewed that uses all five industry-relevant SDG-9 indicators for which there are available data. Halkos et al. (2021)  construct an Inclusive and Green Industrial Performance (IGIP) index for 83 countries as of 2016 in terms of their industrial performance, emphasizing the inclusive and green dimensions. They enhance the earlier Green Industry Performance index (Moll de Alba and Todorov, 2020 ) by adding an inclusiveness dimension to the three dimensions with six indicators of the GIP. The four indicators in the inclusiveness dimension are women in the workforce, the gender pay ratio, women in higher education, and income inequality. Only four of the 20 SSA countries in our analysis are included in the IGIP index. The top two ranked in 2016 are Ghana and Ethiopia and the bottom two are Niger and South Africa. While this expanded index is an industry-relevant index, it includes only one of the seven SDG-9 industry relevant indicators, CO2  emissions per unit of MVA. Saieed et al. (2021)  construct a Sustainable Development Goal-9 Progress (SDG-9Pro) index for 124 countries over the period 2000–2016 in terms of countries' progress in meeting the industry-related targets of SDG-9. The index differs from the performance indices summarized above in that it focuses on changes over time rather than levels of performance at points in time. Another feature of this index is that it shows the progress of countries in relation to their targets, which differ from country to country. It uses the same five indicators for the three industry-related targets of SDG-9 as Kynčlová et al. (2020) . All 20 SSA countries in the global analysis are included in the SDG-9Pro index. The top ranked SSA countries in terms of progress over the period 2000–2016 are Cameroon, Angola, and Botswana, and the bottom ranked countries are Kenya, Senegal, and Côte d'Ivoire. SDG-9Pro is one of two indices among the ten indices reviewed that uses all five industry-relevant SDG-9 indicators for which there are available data. The recent review of SDG indices by Biggeri et al. (2019)  confirms our finding that there have been only limited efforts to use composite indices to measure country progress in meeting industry-related SDG targets and no efforts to construct a progress index. The closest efforts are the SDG-9Per and SDG-9Pro—one a performance index and the other a progress index—both using the same five industry-related indicators. indices using five industry-related indicators, one a performance index and the other a progress index. They have the same limitation as all other indices reviewed because they use only CO2  emission intensity to represent the multiple negative environmental effects of industrialization.  3 Data Indicator data are available from both international custodian agencies as well as the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) making internationally comparable calculations possible (UNSD, 2019a ). There are sufficient data for 2000–2016 in their databases for five industry-related indicators – MVA as a proportion of GDP (9.2.1a), MVA per capita (9.2.1b), manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment (9.2.2), CO2  emissions from manufacturing industries per unit of MVA (9.4.1), and proportion of medium and high-tech manufacturing value added in total value added (9.b.1) (Table 1   and Appendix B  for data used). There are no data for proportion of small-scale industries in total industry value added (9.3.1) and insufficient time series data (2000–2016) for proportion of small-scale industries with a loan or line of credit (9.3.2) to include them in the SDG-9 performance and progress indices. Additional information about these indicators can be found in UNIDO (2019b)  and about the data limitations for SSA countries in Luken et al. (2019) .  4 Performance and progress composite methodologies 4.1 Overview Monitoring and evaluating the achievements of countries in meeting the multidimensionality of SDG targets are both a challenge and an opportunity for the stakeholders involved in implementing the 2030 Agenda. One approach to this challenge is to integrate common trends in the economic, social, and environmental SDG indicators into a single composite index. As shown in the Section Two literature survey, there are several efforts to reduce this complexity by constructing a single dimensional composite index that both evaluate the achievements of countries in meeting SDG targets and identifies the relative contribution of underlying economic, social, and environmental indicators to the overall achievement. In some cases, researchers and policymakers are interested in evaluating the level of achievement of countries in terms of a specific set of outcomes. For this type of composite index, the focus of the analysis is on performance. Examples of this type of composite index are the UN Human Development Index (UNDP, 2019 ) and the Human Sustainable Development Index (Bravo, 2014 ). This kind of performance composite index focuses on levels of achievement of countries at single points in time. In other cases, researchers are more interested in countries’ specific rates of progress. For this type of composite index, the focus is on relative changes in country efforts over time. Examples of this type of composite index are the GEP index (PAGE, 2017a ), the Inclusive Green Energy index (Herrero et al., 2020 ), and the SDG-9 Progress index (Saieed et al., 2021 ). This type of progress composite index differs from performance indices because it focuses on measures of changes rather than levels of achievements and includes, as performance indices do not, both unique targets as policy goals and thresholds as constraining barriers (Herrero et al., 2020 ). While all indices reviewed and the two applied in this paper are informative, they have their limitations. First, no single indicator embodied in them can adequately represent complex phenomena (OECD, 2008 ), thus the importance of using more than one indicator. Second, their values may vary depending on the statistical method used to compile the index, even using the same underlying data (Kwatra et al., 2020 ).  4.2 Performance methodology We apply with variation the SDG-9Per methodology used by Kynčlová et al. (2020)  to estimate the performance of the 20 SSA rather than of 128 countries in her paper for the year 2016. We also use the same set of indicators (MVA/GDP, MVA/PC; EMP, CO2 /MVA and MHT/MVA) and, but the performance scores are different because only 20 rather than 128 countries are used in the min-max equation for the five indicators. All indicators are normalized to render them comparable (OECD, 2008 ). Normalization is done to enable aggregation, as the indicators have different measurement units. Available indicators are normalized into the range [ 0,1 ]     using the min-max method. This method normalizes indicators by subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the range of the indicator values. The equations for the min-max method are:(1) I j c  y  = x j c  y  − m i n c  x j y   m a x c  x j y  − m i n c  x j y        where X jcy     is the value of the j-th variable for the c-the country in year y   , in Eq. (1)  for four of the indicators (MVA/GDP, MVA/PC, EMP and MHT/MVA). Because reductions in CO2  emissions are desirable, lower values are the measures of better performance in Eq. (2) .(2) I j c  y  = m a x c  x j y  − x j c  y   m a x c  x j y  − m i n c  x j y         The SDG-9Per index is constructed as a geometric mean with equal weights for each indicator k for each country c as follows:(3) S D G _  9 P e r c y  = ( ∏  j = 1  k  I j c  y  )  1 k       where S D G _  9 P e r c y    , with values in the range [ 0 , 1  ]    , shows performance for c-th country in year y   . The five normalized indicators in this formulation are given equal weights. This essentially implies that all indicators are worth the same. This was chosen by Kynčlová et al. (2020)  for two reasons: it results in high transparency, and the normalized indicators are associated with a smaller impact of changing the weights.  4.3 Progress methodology We apply without variation the GEP methodology to estimate the progress of the 20 SSA countries between 2000 and 2016 (PAGE, 2017b ). The SDG-9Pro index uses the same five indicators as those used in SDG-9Per. Progress in the indicators is first calculated, and then the different levels of progress are combined to derive the composite SDG-9Pro index. 4.3.1 Targets and thresholds The SDG-9Pro index combines two types of indicators: ‘goods’, and ‘bads’. For ‘goods’ indicators, like MVA/PC, a larger absolute value is better. Meanwhile for ‘bads’ indicators, such as CO2 /MVA, a smaller intensity value is better. Therefore, considering the above two situations, progress in the single indicator case corresponds to the ratio of the actual and desired increments (for the case of ‘goods’) or reductions (for the case of ‘bads’) and can be formulated as follows:(4) Progress = { p goods  ( y 1  , y 0  )   s goods  ( y *  , y 0  )    = dy d y *    = y 1  − y 0   y *  − y 0       p bads  ( y 1  , y 0  )   s bads  ( y *  , y 0  )    = d ( − y )   d ( − y *  )    = y 0  − y 1   y 0  − y *              In Eq. (4) , y0  (the year 2000 in our analysis) is the initial value of an indicator, and y 1     (the year 2016 in our analysis) is the final value of an indicator. For each indicator, its initial and final values are known. Progress is measured relative to the reference value or targets. Targets and thresholds are calculated for determining progress of each country with Eq. (4)  above. Targets (y ∗    ) are formulated for each country by calculating the target rate λ    (‘goods’ indicator) or β    (‘bads’ indicator). The target rate (change ratio) λ    represents the ratio between the final (y 1    ) and initial (y 0    ) values for each indicator for the 90th percentile of the distribution for ‘goods’ indicators. The target for a country is calculated by multiplying its initial value with the λ   , which is 10 percent of the best-performing countries. For example, a country should achieve a target that is based on an increase in the initial year 2000 that is at least as great as the one achieved by the 10 percent best-performing countries. Similarly, the target rate (change ratio) β    represents the ratio between the final (y 1    ) and initial (y 0    ) value for each indicator for the 10th percentile of the distribution for ‘bads’ indicators. The target for a country is set to achieve a reduction as great as the reduction of the 10 percent best-performing countries. In other words, a country should have as a target reduction (y ∗    ) that is as big as the one achieved by the 10 percent of best-performing countries. Thresholds (t   ) temper targets by introducing minimal values that countries should never go below in the case of ‘goods’ indicators, and maximal values that countries should never go above in the case of ‘bads’ indicators. Thresholds are planetary boundaries common to all countries or all countries in an economic development group. They are determined either by internationally accepted scientific sources, such as the threshold limit for air pollution indicators, or they are empirically derived. For example, there is no scientific evidence for determining an appropriate value for the indicator MVA in GDP. In such cases, thresholds are determined empirically in the same way used for some of the 13 indicators in the GEP index. For ‘good’ indicators, the threshold is set at the 25th percentile of the distribution in the initial year, and for ‘bads’ indicators, it is set at the 75th percentile in the initial year. Hence, countries should not go below or achieve less than the point that is achieved by the bottom 25 percent of countries for ‘goods’ indicators in the initial year. Conversely, no country should go above or increase more than the top 75 percent of countries for ‘bads’ indicators in the initial year. Hence, for ‘goods’ indicators, a target is expressed by y ∗     = λy 0  with λ  > 1. This is applicable if λy 0 > t   . In other words, the target of a country should be above the threshold. If the target of a country is below the threshold after multiplying with its initial value with λ   , then the target of that country should be the common threshold (planetary boundary), y ∗     = t   . Similarly, for ‘bads’ indicators, a target is expressed as y ∗     = βy   0,  with β    <1. This is pertinent if the βy   0 < t   . In other words, the target of a country should be below the threshold. If the target of a country remains above the threshold after multiplying the initial value with β   , then the target value of the country should be at the common threshold (planetary boundary), y ∗     = t   . Threshold plays a key role in determining targets by applying Eq. (5)  to determine that y ∗     = λy 0  > t or at least y ∗     = t   , and y ∗     = βy   0 < t or at most y ∗     = t   .(5) y ∗  = max { t , λ y 0   }  , λ > 1  ( 'goods' )     y ∗  = min { t , β y 0   }  , β < 1  ( 'bads' )           The target of a country needs to be the minimum threshold of the entire distribution.  4.3.2 Constructing progress The progress rate of countries on each of the indicators is developed using the formula below after specifying the target:(6) P r o g r e s s = { d y  d y ∗    = y 1  − y 0   m a x { t , λ y 0   }  − y 0    ,  λ > 1    d ( − y )   d ( − y ∗  )    = y 0  − y 1   y 0  − m i n { t , β y 0   }    ,  β < 1           In formula (6) , the index can be negative as well in some situations. For ‘goods’ indicators, if the final year value is lower than the initial year value, then the index will be negative. For ‘bads’ indicators, if the final year value is higher than the initial year value, then the index will be negative. In addition, the index value can go below or above one, depending on whether actual progress is above or below the target.  4.3.3 Weighting system A weighting mechanism is required to calculate the index correctly because of the number of indicators. GEP methodology follows two weighting procedures. It develops a single indicator weight called weight 1 and reweighting it among indicators called weight 2. Step 1: Initial position relative to the threshold per indicator  . Weight 1 is a ratio of the initial value and threshold using formula (7) . For ‘goods,’ the smaller the y j 0    , the larger the weight. For ‘bads,’ the larger the y j 0    , the larger the weight .   (7) π ˆ  j  = { t j  y j 0   ,  i f  j ∈ G    y j 0  t j   ,  i f  j ∈ B           Step 2: Relative progress among indicators  . The second weight π j     is formed using Eq. (8) . It determines the relative progress for one indicator vis-à-vis the others.(8) π j  = π j  ˆ  ∑  j ∈ J   π j  ˆ    ， ∑  j ∈ J   π j  = 1      Therefore, weight 2 ( π j  )    shows the importance of one indicator over others. The final SDG9-Pro index is constructed through the aggregation of each indicator by using Eq. (9)  below:(9) S D G 9 P r o  I n d e x = ∑  j ∈ G   π j  d y j   d y j ∗    + ∑  j ∈ B   π j  d ( − y j  )   d ( − y j ∗  )        where j refers to an indicator, G    is ‘goods’ indicators, and B ‘bads’ indicators.    5 Ranking of 20 SSA countries with SDG-9Pro and SDG-9Per indices Our research aims to compare achievements in meeting SDG-9 industry-related targets using two different methodologies – progress and performance. SDG-9Per shows the level of performance as of 2016. The SDG-9Per index values in this article are different from those in Kynčlová et al. (2020)  because our paper calculates the min-max values for each of the five indicators using only 20 rather than 128 countries. SDG-9Pro shows countries that make positive gains and negative losses (regressed) between 2000 and 2016; it does not show the level of performance in 2016. However, the SDG-9Pro index values differ from those in Saieed et al. (2021)  because of the change in the targets (the 90th percentile of the 20 rather than the 124 country distribution of the ‘goods’ indicators, and the 10th percentile of the 20 rather than the 124 country distribution of the ‘bads’ indicators) and thresholds (the 25th percentile of the 20 rather than the 124 country distribution of the ‘goods’ indicators, and 75th percentile of the 20 rather than the 124 country distribution of the ‘bads’ indicators). Not surprisingly, countries rank differently on their progress (movement towards a target) and performance (level of achievement) (Table 2  ). Whereas Cameroon ranks 1st among 20 countries on progress over the period 2000–2016, it ranks 4th on performance in 2016. Similarly, South Africa ranks only 15th on progress over the period 2000–2016 and ranks 2nd in terms of performance. Whereas Niger ranks 14th on progress over the period 2000–2016 over the period 2000–2016, it ranks 20th on performance in 2016.  6 Ranking integration The next step in our analysis integrates the ranking of countries with both the SDG-9Pro and SDG-9Per indices. We assign the 20 countries to one of four quadrants based on their two index values in Table 2 . Definitions of these two indices suggest characteristic words to describe each of the four quadrants (Fig. 1  ). For SDG-9Per, a country is described as leading if its score (level of performance) is higher than the median (0.257) and lagging if its score is lower than the median. For SDG-9Pro, a country is described as active (movement towards a target) if its score is higher than the median (0.247), and passive if its score is equal to or lower than the median. Therefore, the top right quadrant (I) includes leading and active countries in performance and progress, represented by ‘leading-active’. The bottom right quadrant (II) includes countries that are leading in performance but passive in progress, characterized as ‘leading-passive’. The top left quadrant (III) includes countries that are lagging in performance but active in progress, characterized as ‘lagging-active’. The bottom left quadrant (IV) includes lagging and passive countries characterized as ‘lagging-passive’. There is an unequal number of SSA countries in each category. Four countries are classified as ‘leading-active’, with Mauritius having the highest level of performance as of 2016 and Cameroon having progressed the most between 2000 and 2016. Six countries are classified as ‘leading-passive’, with South Africa having the highest level of performance as of 2016 and Zambia having progressed the most (gaining ground) between 2000 and 2016. Six countries are classified as ‘lagging-active’ with Zimbabwe having a higher level of performance in this category but still lagging as of 2016, and Angola having progressed the most among countries in this category between 2000 and 2016. Four countries are classified as ‘lagging-passive’ with Ghana performing relatively better than others in this category as of 2016, and Gabon the least passive than others in this category between 2000 and 2016. We checked to see if there is a preponderance of Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in the four categories. Not surprisingly, seven of the nine LDCs are classified as lagging – five (Angola, Congo, Ethiopia, Mozambique, and U.R. Tanzania) as ‘lagging-active’ and two (Eritrea and Niger) as ‘lagging-passive’. The other two (Senegal and Zambia) are classified as ‘leading-passive’. Not unexpectedly, nine of the ten countries classified by UNIDO as either Emerging Industrial Economies or Other Developing Economies are classified as either ‘leading-active’ (Botswana, Cameroon, Mauritius, and Nigeria) or as ‘leading-passive (Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Namibia, and South Africa). Only two Other Developing Economies are lagging; Zimbabwe is ‘lagging-active’, and Ghana is ‘lagging-passive’ (UNIDO, 2019c ).  7 Policy analysis In this section, we identify the relative contribution of indicators to SDG-9 progress and performance. Because of various resource endowments, natural conditions, political and cultural environment, SDG-9 progress and performance of the 20 countries differ on each indicator. As SDG-9Pro and SDG-9Per indicators are based on different units (monetary, population, kilograms of CO2 ), their values cannot be compared across indicators. Instead, we rank each indicator separately among all countries based on the normalized indicator scores in Appendix C . The indicator on the SDG-9Pro row with the lightest shade of grey made the greatest contribution, and the one with the darkest shade of grey on the SDG-9Pro row made the least contribution among the five indicators to improving country progress in meeting SDG-9 targets (Table 3  ). Similarly, the indicator in the SDG-9Per row with the lightest shade of grey made the greatest contribution, and the indicator with the darkest shade of grey made the least contribution among the five indicators to improving country performance in meeting SDG-9 targets. For the purposes of this analysis, we focus on the indicator that made the least contribution to a country's SDG-9 index. It is marked with three white dots in Table 3 . The indicator that made the least contribution among the five indicators identified in Table 3  above is listed in Table 4   below. SDG-9Pro identifies EMP as the indicator making the least contribution to progress in the most countries (nine) followed closely by CO2 /MVA in eight countries. SDG-9Per identifies MVA/PC as the dominant indicator (thirteen countries) in performance followed distantly by MHT/MVA in three countries. Urgently needed are numerous and effective policies and institutions to meet SDG targets in SSA countries (Omisore, 2018 ). From a public policy perspective, the acceleration of sustainable industrial development to meet SDG-9 targets requires drawing on a range of policy streams such as those suggested by Altenburg and Assmann (2017) , Altenburg and Lütkenhorst (2017) , IFC (2015) , and Weiss (2018) . UNIDO (2011)  consolidated a broad range of these interventions that directly and indirectly support sustainable industrial development (Fig. 2  ). These range across industrial policy (e.g.,  technology development), employment policy (e.g.,  training), energy policy (e.g.,  energy efficiency), and environmental policy (e.g.,  pollution control). These interventions are characterized both as hard and soft policies in terms of the flexibility of implementation and penalizing, motivating, and supporting strategies in terms of the stringency of application. For the purposes of our policy review, they are broadly related to our four country groups. For ‘leading-active’ countries, governments need to consider implementing supportive policies such as information tools and monitoring, whereas ‘leading-passive’ countries need to consider using voluntary agreements and extended producer responsibility. For ‘lagging-active’ countries, governments need to consider clustering industrial activities and innovative financing schemes, whereas for ‘lagging-passive’ countries, governments need to consider command-and-control regulation and various economic incentives to accelerate progress towards sustainable industrialization. Our suggestive approach to policy analysis would start with those indicators that made the least contribution to country rankings. It draws on policies considered most relevant for each country group (Fig. 2 ). While doing this would be more relevant for each country, we limit our discussion to country groups because this is a sufficient demonstration of the heuristic value of using the findings of composite indices to stimulate policy dialogue and public discussion. In the ‘leading-active’ country group, SDG-9Pro identifies EMP as the dominant indicator needing attention, whereas SDG-9Per identifies MHT/MVA and MVA/PC as the dominant indicators needing attention. For the SDG-9Pro countries, education and training that increase skills have the potential to increase EMP; for the SDG-9Per countries, technology diffusion has the potential to enlarge the share of MHT/MVA. In the ‘leading-passive’ country group, SDG-9Pro identifies CO2 /MVA as the indicator needing attention in three of the six countries, whereas SDG-9Per identifies MVA/PC as the indicator needing attention in four of the six countries. For the SDG-Pro countries, technology diffusion has the potential to reduce CO2 /MVA; for the SDG-9Per countries, supply chain management and trade agreements have the potential to increase MVA/PC. In the ‘lagging-active’ country group, SDG-Pro identifies EMP in three countries and CO2 /MVA in two countries as the indicators needing the most attention; SDG-9Per identifies MVA/PC in four countries and MVA/GDP in one country as the indicators needing the most attention. For SDG-9Pro countries, clusters/networks have the potential to increase EMP and research and development has the potential to reduce CO2 /MVA; for SDG-9Per countries, clusters/networks and trade agreements have the potential to increase MVA/PC and MVA/GDP. In the ‘lagging-passive’ country group, SDG-9Pro identifies CO2 /MVA as the dominant indicator whereas SDG-9Per identifies MVA/PC as the dominant indicator needing attention in three of the four countries. For the SDG-9Pro countries, increasing awareness of norms and standards that encourage energy efficiency has the potential to reduce CO2 /MVA. For SDG-9Per countries, none of the policy options in the matrix the potential to increase MVA/PC. While it is not possible within the scope of a journal article to review the more important policy initiatives for each of the 20 SSA countries, we identify, as illustrative, one initiative for one country in each county group, which addresses four of the five indicators, as follows:• Nigeria: EMP fell from 9.8 percent of total in 2004 to 7.9 percent in 2013, the latest year for which there are collected data (UNIDO, 2019d ). Its draft National Employment Policy acknowledges that the labour absorptive capacity of the Nigerian economy has not kept pace with growth. The policy identifies key strategies that would stimulate employment-intensive growth and raise the labour absorption capacity of the Nigerian economy. It recognizes the importance of strengthening existing coordination mechanisms to streamline employment-generation efforts in the economy, involving the private sector in these efforts, and providing supportive infrastructure (Evoh and Abu, 2016 ).  • Zambia: MVA/GDP decreased from 9.2 percent in 2000 to 7.5 percent in 2016 (UNIDO, 2019d ). The National Development Plan 2017–2021 aims to reverse this decline with a private sector development strategy that calls for new investments and productivity growth. The Government will implement key reforms, such as those dealing with business licensing and regulation, trade logistics, small business development and ease of doing business. The Government will also enhance the capacity of the public sector to support the growth and development of the private sector (Government of Zambia, 2017 ).  • U.R. Tanzania: MHT/MVA steeply declined from 20.2 percent in 2000 to 6.5 percent in 2016 (UNIDO, 2019d ). The National Five-Year Development Plan 2021/22–2025/2026 recognizes the importance of shifting from public to private sector manufacturing and of innovation to adopt new technologies. The manufacturing section of the plan focuses mainly on promoting and supporting agro-processing industries, particularly leather and edible oils. However, the plan also calls developing iron and steel technologies from locally available ore deposits, and promotion of national champions (“competitive big business”), which includes chemicals (petrochemicals and other chemicals) and pharmaceuticals (United Republic of Tanzania, 2021 ).  • Ghana: CO2 /MVA increased from 0.20 kg CO2 /MVA in 2000 to 0.30 kg CO2 /MVA in 2016 (UNIDO, 2019d ). The National Climate Change Policy of Ghana identifies industry as one of the five focus areas for reducing emissions. The policy aims to minimize greenhouse gas emissions by encouraging the use efficient energy and clean energy technologies that contribute towards economic development, as well as result in green development and optimal national emission rates. Key policy interventions include support for energy efficiency and management activities and incentives and finance that encourage and support the use of renewable sources of energy (Government of Ghana, 2013 ).     8 Concluding remarks This article uses one index (SDG-9Pro) for measuring the progress and one index (SDG-9Per) for measuring performance of 20 SSA countries in meeting industry-related SDG-9 targets. Both indices, SDG-9Pro and SDG-9Per, are based on the same data and same period but are constructed using different methodologies. Our literature review of composite indices did not find any articles that applied both methodologies to identify policies that have the potential to accelerate the progress and performance of SSA countries towards industry-related SDG-9 targets, thus making our article a contribution to the literature about the heuristic value of common comparator country indices to initiate policy dialogue and to stimulate public discussion. The integration of the two indices is the basis for classifying countries as either active or passive as measured by SDG-9Pro, and as either leading or lagging as measured by SDG-9Per. Four countries are classified as ‘leading-active,’ with Mauritius having the best performance and Cameroon being the most active in 2016 in this cluster. Six countries are classified as ‘leading-passive,’ with South Africa having the best performance and Senegal being the most passive in this cluster. Six countries are classified as ‘lagging-active’ with Zimbabwe performing relatively better than other countries in 2016, and Angola having progressed the most between 2000 and 2016 in this cluster. Four countries are classified as ‘lagging-passive’ with Ghana performing relatively among the four countries in 2016, and Gabon the least passive between 2000 and 2016 in this cluster. Expectedly, seven of the nine Least Developing Countries among the 20 SSA countries are classified as ‘lagging’, and eight of the ten Emerging Industrial Economies and Other Developing Countries are classified as ‘leading’. Combining the four country groupings and the policy options matrix demonstrates the heuristic value of using index findings to stimulate government and public discussions about the most-attention-worthy policy domains. For the countries classified as ‘leading-active,’ education and training that increase skills and clusters/networks have the potential to increase employment, and improved technology diffusion has the potential to expand medium- and high-technology sectors. For most of the countries classified as ‘leading passive,’ technology diffusion has the potential to reduce carbon dioxide emission intensity, and supply chain management and trade agreements have potential to increase both total manufacturing value added and per capita manufacturing value added. For the countries classified as ‘lagging-active,’ clusters/networks have the potential to increase employment, financial incentives such as tax breaks and the introduction of environmental management systems have the potential to reduce CO2  emissions, and clusters/networks and trade agreements have the potential to increase per capita manufacturing value added. For the four countries classified as ‘lagging-passive,’ increasing the awareness of norms and standards that encourage energy efficiency has the potential to reduce carbon dioxide emission intensity; none of the policy options have the potential to increase per capita manufacturing value added.
