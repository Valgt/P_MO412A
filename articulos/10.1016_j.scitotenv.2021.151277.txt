                  To promote coordinated development of the global economy, society, and environment, The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of the United Nations (UN) specifies 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) with 169 nested targets. Studies have shown that a healthy ecological environment and stable ecosystem services (ESs) provide an important foundation for achieving the SDGs. Due to the lack of quantitative methods for assessing the contribution of ESs to SDGs, very few empirical studies have been conducted to examine how knowledge of ESs can guide regional sustainable development. From the perspective of an ES cascade, we proposed a systematic approach for quantifying progress towards environment-related SDGs in terms of ES indicators, based on the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB). The scores of multiple SDGs and the SDG Index increased significantly across the YREB from 2000 to 2015, mainly attributed to the improvement of food and water provisioning services. Significant spatiotemporal variation in sustainable development levels was observed between provinces within the YREB. For example, the sustainable development levels in the eastern YREB clearly trailed those in the central and western YREB, and the SDG scores and SDG Index scores declined gradually. Among 11 provincial regions in the YREB, the SDG Index scores of nine provincial regions increased gradually, whereas those of Zhejiang and Shanghai declined. Strengthening the assessment of the ES value for generating more comprehensive ES indicators and applying an integrated ES-based approach for monitoring and comparing the process of local and global sustainable development, are promising areas for future research.

Studies have shown that a healthy ecological environment and stable ecosystem services (ESs) provide an important foundation for achieving the SDGs. Due to the lack of quantitative methods for assessing the contribution of ESs to SDGs, very few empirical studies have been conducted to examine how knowledge of ESs can guide regional sustainable development. From the perspective of an ES cascade, we proposed a systematic approach for quantifying progress towards environment-related SDGs in terms of ES indicators, based on the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB). The scores of multiple SDGs and the SDG Index increased significantly across the YREB from 2000 to 2015, mainly attributed to the improvement of food and water provisioning services. Significant spatiotemporal variation in sustainable development levels was observed between provinces within the YREB. For example, the sustainable development levels in the eastern YREB clearly trailed those in the central and western YREB, and the SDG scores and SDG Index scores declined gradually. Among 11 provincial regions in the YREB, the SDG Index scores of nine provincial regions increased gradually, whereas those of Zhejiang and Shanghai declined. Strengthening the assessment of the ES value for generating more comprehensive ES indicators and applying an integrated ES-based approach for monitoring and comparing the process of local and global sustainable development, are promising areas for future research.   Graphical abstract Unlabelled Image       Keywords Sustainable development goals  Ecosystem service approach  Quantitative assessment  Environmental benefits  YREB    1 Introduction Since the second half of the 20th century, continuous population expansion and rapid economic growth have resulted in excessive consumption of natural resources and frequent occurrences of environmental events worldwide. In this context, the international community began to think and explore how to coordinate economic, social, and environmental development (Gret-Regamey et al., 2019 ; Liu et al., 2015 ). The Limits to Growth  (Meadows et al., 1972 ) and Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  (United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), 1972 ) expounded on the planetary boundaries involved in human activities supported by ecosystems. This raised concerns regarding resources and environmental constraints, prompting many to value ecological protection of the environment. Our Common Future  (World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED), 1987 ) expressly proposed the concept of “sustainable development”. Subsequently, the concept was further elaborated in UN resolutions, such as Agenda 21  (United Nations, 1992 ) and the United Nations Millennium Declaration  (United Nations, 2015a ), becoming a strategic guidance for eliminating extreme poverty, hunger, and discrimination, and promoting gender equity, environmental protection, and sustainable development among many countries worldwide. However, as the understanding of sustainable development has continuously deepened in the international community, and the limitations of millennium development goals are becoming apparent, it is crucial to develop new goals and agendas that guide global sustainable development. In response to the increasingly severe environmental situations and pressing demands by mankind for inclusive growth in the new era, the UN formally adopted Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development  in 2015 (United Nations, 2015b ), proposing more 17 universal and comprehensive sustainable development goals (SDGs) and 169 targets, and systematically establishing a development blueprint for human society over the next 15 years. The document offers strategic guidance for economic growth, social development, and resource utilisation among countries around the world. To turn SDGs into problem-solving tools, it is essential to objectively and dynamically monitor the implementation process of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development  (Xu et al., 2020a ). To facilitate continuous implementation of measures for sustainable development under the guidance of the agenda, the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) has preliminarily developed a global assessment framework with over 200 specific indicators, based on the work of the Interagency Expert Group, thus monitoring the fulfilment status of SDGs among different countries (Sachs et al., 2018 ; Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017 ). Compared with the millennium development goals, the goals specified in The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development  are more systematic and extensive. However, the potential trade-off between environment and human well-being has not been properly assessed (Wood and DeClerck, 2015 ), and it is necessary to deepen the understanding of the importance of environmental assessment targets. According to preliminary statistics, only 46 of the 232 internationally recognised indicators are environmentally related, or even extension to social or socioeconomic environments (Cochran et al., 2020 ). Moreover, available data related to these indicators are provided by statistics agencies, which are inconsistent in terms of statistical standards and methods (Huan et al., 2019 ; Huan et al., 2021 ; Xu et al., 2020a ). Ongoing studies have highlighted the fact that geospatial information and earth observations can be used to acquire high-quality spatiotemporal data within a long time series, and create environmental assessment indicators or composite indicators, thus helping to monitor and compare progress towards the SDGs across different countries or regions worldwide (Cochran et al., 2020 ; Guo et al., 2021 ). ES indicators based on earth observations are composite indicators that integrate biophysical characteristics and human socioeconomic characteristics. As one of the most common types of earth observation data, changes in land use and coverage are widely used to generate environmental indicators concerning the biophysical supply of ecosystem services (ESs). Based on comprehensive environmental and socioeconomic data, researchers can quantitatively measure the demand for ESs and create composite ES indicators for assessing ESs and monitoring the fulfilment status of SDGs (Geijzendorffer et al., 2017 ; Johnson et al., 2019 ; Ward et al., 2018 ; Wood et al., 2018 ). Numerous studies have indicated that ESs can improve the well-being of humans, in line with the numerous aspirations contained in the SDGs, and can provide an important basis for fulfilling the SDGs (Mononen et al., 2016 ; Wood et al., 2018 ; Yang et al., 2020 ). The management of ESs aims to improve benefits and human well-being derived from natural systems, and minimize the eco-environmental costs and negative impacts of fulfilling the SDGs. Importantly, the fulfilment of higher-level socioeconomic goals also depends on a healthy earthly environment. It is vital to apply the ES knowledge and related methods to the management and decision-making of sustainable development (Arkema et al., 2015 ; Bateman et al., 2013 ). The ES cascade model provides an important framework and paradigm for the study, management, and assisted decision-making of ESs, and it emphasizes the relationship between the ecosystem structure and function, and human benefits derived from nature. Using a pressure-state-response model, Haines-Young and Potschin (2010)  built an organic link between natural ecosystems and socioeconomic systems, and systematically analysed the “ecosystem structure and process-function-service-benefit-value” cascade process, thus establishing the connection between ecosystems and human well-being. Subsequently, many researchers and organisations have continuously improved the cascade model and have carried out extensive applied studies on a regional or even global scale, focusing on topics such as the formation and influencing mechanisms of ES, relationships between ESs, and the impacts of ES on human well-being (Diaz et al., 2015 ; Fedele et al., 2017 ; La Notte et al., 2017 ; Potschin-Young et al., 2018 ; Rugani et al., 2019 ). Therefore, the ES cascade model provides an interdisciplinary and multi-system approach, incorporating natural capital and ESs into the assessment and policy management of sustainable development at different levels. In summary, the efforts and achievements of the ES cascade model and its widespread application worldwide have greatly advanced our understanding of ESs, especially in confronting social, economic, and ecological challenges and achieving sustainable development of human and nature system. However, applying this ES knowledge and methods for quantitatively monitoring the implementation progress of SDGs across local to global levels remains an important challenge facing current scientific research and decision-making management. To overcome this challenge, this study mainly focused on the following two aspects. First, based on the ES cascade model, we proposed a systematic approach based on ES for monitoring the sustainable development process. According to the understanding of the important contribution of ES to SDG, we ascertained quantitative relationships between ESs and SDGs. Hence, this approach provides an important and practical tool for monitoring regional sustainable development process and conducting sustainable development management, using ES knowledge and methods. Second, we conducted an empirical study on the YREB using the presented assessment framework. Specifically, we calculated and analysed spatiotemporal variation characteristics of multiple SDGs and the SDG Index in the YREB from 2000 to 2015. The findings can assist policymakers in monitoring the current situation and processes, locating the gaps of regional sustainable development, and providing a scientific basis for formulating sustainable development policies.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Framework for measuring regional progress towards SDGs The ES cascade model is mainly composed of five components: structure, process, function, service, and sustainability. These depicted the cascade process of the coupled human–natural system from structure and functions through to SDGs (Fig. 1 a ). The cascade model starts from the constituent structure of the coupled system, which is the foundation for providing diverse ecological services and fulfilling the SDGs (de Groot et al., 2010 ; de Groot et al., 2002 ). As the most distinct representation under the joint actions of natural and socioeconomic factors, the change in land use and land cover was selected as the key factor for studying the compound ecosystem structure and spatial patterns (Bryan et al., 2018 ; Johnson et al., 2019 ). The ecosystem structures and the interaction between them generate a series of biological, physical, and chemical processes and functions, and constitute various ecological services under the societal choices and values. These services are prerequisite for human survival and development, and are also the main metric for human well-being and sustainable development (Geijzendorffer et al., 2017 ; Wood and DeClerck, 2015 ). It should be noted that a complex mutual feedback mechanism, rather than a simple unidirectional transmission mechanism, exists between different links of the cascade model. Based on benefits and preferences, action policies for exerting pressure or stimuli to the coupled system can be formulated for changing its biophysical structure and process, thereby affecting (e.g., promoting or restricting) the supply and transmission of some ecological functions and services (Zhang et al., 2021 ). Based on the conceptual cascade model, we presented and tested an assessment framework based on ES approach for monitoring the regional process of achieving SDGs in the YREB (Fig. 1 b). The empirical research framework includes four steps. First, we analysed the temporal and spatial dynamic characteristics of ecosystem structure using the land use and cover data from 2000 to 2015. Second, we summarized the main ecological processes and ecological functions in the YREB. Third, we selected five ES indicators for the YREB, based on the importance of the ES for achieving SDGs. Then we quantitatively simulated the biophysical values of the ESs by constructing multiple ecological service assessment models, and analysed their temporal and spatial dynamic characteristics. Fourth, according to the ES-SDG Target-SDG linkages, quantitative equations were constructed to calculate the SDG and SDG Index scores of the YREB and its provinces. According to the results of the temporal and spatial change analyses of the SDGs and SDG Index scores, we propose suggestions regarding land management and planning to improve the ESs and enhance sustainable development.  2.2 Study area and ecosystem structure 2.2.1 Study area The YREB is one of the major national strategic development areas implemented by the Chinese central government and is an important link between the “Silk Road Economic Belt” and the “21st Century Maritime Silk Road”. It comprises 11 provincial regions (including Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Chongqing, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou) and covers an area of about 2.05 million km2 , accounting for 21.4% of China's territorial area (Fig. 2  ). Located in a subtropical monsoon climate zone, the YREB has a warm climate and ample rainfall. From 2000 to 2015, the annual average temperature and annual precipitation ranged from 14.2 °C to 17.8 °C and from 873.9 mm to 2397.5 mm, respectively (Chen et al., 2021 ). The YREB spans the three major regions of East, Central and West China, with a unique ecosystem and rich natural resources, which is an indispensable part of China's ecological security pattern and is one of the regions with the richest biodiversity in the world. In 2000, the YREB had a population of 5.52 × 108  and a gross domestic product (GDP) of 4.02 × 1012  yuan. In 2015, its population increased by 6.52% to 5.88 × 108  and its GDP increased by 659.2% to 30.52 × 1012  yuan (China statistical yearbook, 2000–2015). It is an extremely important ecological carrying area, agricultural production area and economic development area in China, and a giant basin-based macroeconomic coordination belt with the largest population and industrial scale, and the most complete urban system in the world. However, the long-term high-intensity development and the lack of scientific spatial management has resulted in dramatic eco-environmental issues, such as the ongoing losses of natural forest and biodiversity, water and air pollution, and soil erosion. Since 2014, the Chinese government has successively promulgated and implemented the “Outline of the Yangtze River Economic Belt Development Plan” and the “Eco-environmental Protection Plan covering Yangtze River Economic Belt”, which clearly states that eco-environmental protection should be a prerequisite for economic development, and must improve the conservation of the Yangtze River and prevent overdevelopment in favor of coordinated and high-quality development of upstream, middle and downstream regions in an all-round manner. Forging the comprehensive, coordinated and sustainable development of social economy and ecological environment in the YREB is consistent with the 2030 agenda for SDGs. Therefore, considering the national strategic position and the realistic needs of sustainable development, selecting the YREB for assessing regional process of achieving the 2030 agenda for SDGs in China has important strategic and practical significance.  2.2.2 Land use and land cover The land use and land cover data of the YREB in 2000 and 2015 were obtained using manual visual interpretation based on the Landsat TM/OLI images, and were classified into seven categories: cropland, woodland, orchard, grassland, water, urban and bare land. Furthermore, field-measured land use and cover types with global positioning system (GPS) coordinates were used to validate the maps; the overall identification accuracy was over 90%. Among them, woodland, cropland, and grassland account for about 45%, 30%, and 17%, respectively, of land use and land cover (Fig. 3 A–B ). Croplands are mainly distributed in flat alluvial plains, including the Chengdu Plain in western Sichuan, the Jianghan and Lianghu Plains in central Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi, and the Jianghuai Plain in eastern Jiangsu and Anhui. Woodlands and grasslands are mainly distributed in steep hills and mountains, and are interleaved with croplands. The urban construction land in the YREB is noticeably agglomerated on both sides of the Yangtze River, forming large-scale trans-provincial city clusters. At the provincial level, over 65% of the ecological land in the YREB is mainly distributed in the Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Yunnan provinces. The proportion of urban construction land varies significantly across different provincial regions, as shown by the Shanghai-headed declining spatial gradient pattern from the lower reaches to the middle reaches and finally to the upper reaches. In 2015, for example, the proportions of urban construction land in Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang were 29.31%, 17.69%, and 7.19%, respectively, whereas those of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou were as low as 0.96%, 0.91%, and 0.77%, respectively. From 2000 to 2015, the evolution of land use structures in the YREB was characterised by the expansion of urban construction land, along with the expropriation of agricultural land, and conversion between ecological lands (e.g., woodlands and croplands) (Table 1  ). To be specific, the cropland area decreased by 26,177 km2 , over 64% and 23% of which was converted into construction land or forests and grasslands, respectively. Meanwhile, the cropland area increased by 6571 km2 , mainly due to the development and utilisation of orchards and grasslands. The area of construction land increased by 51% to 21,387 km2  and varied most significantly among all types of land use. The spatial variation in construction land was mainly characterised by the expansion of existing construction land and the occupation of surrounding croplands (Fig. 3 C). In addition to the interconversion between grasslands and croplands, 5975 km2  of woodlands was converted into 3099 km2  and 2876 km2  of orchards and construction lands, respectively.   2.3 Quantifying ESs 2.3.1 ES indicators selection and quantitation Wood et al. (2018)  designed an online questionnaire and distributed it in two rounds to 328 experts in ESs and 231 experts in development decision-making worldwide, to solicit their perceptions of ES contribution to SDG targets. The survey involved 704 potential ESs-SDG target combinations coupling 16 ESs with 44 SDG targets under 12 SDGs. Among them, 178 unique combinations received strong expert support and are considered to have ‘High’ importance for the attainment of the target. Those most frequently associated with the selected SDGs were habitat and biodiversity maintenance services, food provision service, water provision service, and carbon storage; these strongly supported more than 40% of all the targets under the selected SDGs. In addition to the above ecosystem functions and services, as soil erosion is a prominent problem facing the sustainable development of the YREB, soil retention service should be prioritized as an ES indicator integrated into regional sustainable development assessment. In this case study, we therefore selected five types of ESs that contribute most significantly to regional sustainable development, including supply services (food and water provision), support services (habitat and biodiversity), and regulation services (erosion control and carbon storage). The supply capacity of ESs depends on the ecosystem structure and associated processes; the directed development and utilisation activities of humans may change or even break the original balance of the natural ecosystem, causing alterations or obstacles to its structure, process, and functions (Fu et al., 2015 ). It is both challenging and burdensome to accurately quantify the ESs provided by the coupled human–natural system, because the effects of both natural and human activities need to be considered. We used diverse methods (e.g. USLE, InVEST model) to quantify the biomass provisions of different ESs (Table 2  ). In addition, we simulated the amount of ESs and their spatial distribution under different ecological structures in the YREB in 2000 and 2015 by altering the input of land use and land cover data. By comparing the provisioning scale and spatial distribution pattern of ESs in the two periods, we detected the temporal and spatial change characteristics of various ESs at a provincial level.  2.3.2 Model validation and performance assessments To assess the regional applicability and simulation accuracy of the ES model, we used station monitoring data, field measurement data, remote sensing data and data from published literature for calibrating and verifying the ES assessment model. We also introduced statistical indices (such as correlation and regression coefficients) to quantify the simulation accuracy of the model. We selected the measured values of annual average runoff of seven hydrological stations (the Pingshan, Cuntan, Zhutuo, Yichang, Shashi, Hankou, and Datong stations), located in the trunk stream of the Yangtze River, for calibrating and verifying the simulation output and parameters of the water-provision model of the Yangtze River basin. The statistical data revealed a significant consistence between simulated and measured runoff values (r  = 0.99, n  = 7, p  < 0.01; Fig. 4 a ). Using the measured sediment runoff of the Datong hydrological station along the trunk stream of the Yangtze River and seven hydrological stations (the Tongzilin, Gaochang, Beibei, Wulong, Huangzhuang, and Xiangtan stations) in the tributaries of the Yangtze River, we verified the soil erosion model on two scales (the whole Yangtze River basin and the sub-basin). The simulated results were consistent with the corresponding observed values (r  = 0.854, n  = 8, p < 0.01; Fig. 4 b). Based on the carbon densities of different ecosystem types, published data, and field measurement data, we estimated the aboveground biomass and underground organic carbon of all provincial regions in the YREB. On a provincial scale, we verified the total carbon storage levels and those of two components (aboveground biomass carbon and organic carbon). The simulated values of total carbon storage, aboveground biomass carbon storage, and underground organic carbon storage were consistent with their observed values (Fig. 4 c–e). As an important indicator of regional vegetation coverage and ecological quality, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is widely used to assess regional biological abundances and animal habitat qualities. In this study, the NDVI was used to verify the InVEST Habitat Quality model (described in Table 2 ). The verification results showed that the NDVI was strongly correlated and was consistent on a provincial scale (Fig. 4 f). Therefore, our results showed that the ES model used in this study was highly applicable and provided an accurate simulation for the YREB; the simulation results can be reasonably used to quantify the services of water provision, soil retention, carbon storage, and habitat & biodiversity maintenance in the YREB.   2.4 Scoring SDG and SDG Index 2.4.1 Normalization of ecosystem service biomass Various ES indicators have different attributes, magnitudes, and quantitative units, making it impossible to directly conduct comprehensive comparisons or weighting summations. To eliminate the differences between different ES indicators, we first used the following formula (Eq. (1) ) to normalize the biophysical values on a scale of 0 to 100.(1) ES i ′  = ES i  − Min ES i     Max ES i   − Min ES i     × 100    where ES i  ′ and ES i   refer to the normalized scores and biophysical values of a modelled ES i  respectively. Max (ES i  ) and Min (ES i  ) refer to the maximum and minimum biophysical values of ES i  respectively.  2.4.2 Calculation of SDG and SDG Index According to the ES-SDG target-SDG linkages suggested by Wood et al. (2018) , we selected some linkages that are considered to provide strongly important support for regional sustainable development in the YREB. As shown in Fig. 5  , the more lifelines one ES emits, the greater the number of SDGs and its targets that the ES strongly supports. Similarly, the more lifelines the SDGs and its targets receive, the more ES foundations they can depend on. Therefore, according to the relationship between ESs and SDG targets, the normalized scores of ES supply were used to evaluate relative spatiotemporal performance towards achieving the SDGs based on the following equation:(2) SDG j  = ∑ i = 1  n  ES i ′  × x i  × T i , j   × y j     ∑ i = 1  n  T i , j         where SDG j   is the assessed score of an SDG j ; T i , j   is the number of ES-target linkages under the SDG j ; and x i   and y j   are the weights of ES i and targets within the SDG j , respectively. In this study, both x  and y  were set to 1, which indicates that every indicator has the same priority within each SDG. For example, there are three targets (1.1, 1.2, and 1.5) under SDG 1 (No Poverty), which are respectively strongly supported by the water provision, food provision and soil retention, as shown in Fig. 5 . Consequently, the score of SDG 1 (No Poverty) under a certain time and space can be expressed as [(ESwater provision  × 3) + (ESfood provision  × 3) + (EShabitat & biodiversity  × 3)]/(3 + 3 + 3), according to Eq. (2) . This is a weighted average solution equation based on the normalized supply of ES with the number of linked SDG targets as the coefficient. Similar to the value range of normalized ES supply, the SDG score is also a standardized value on a scale of 0 to 100; the SDG scores are thus comparable over time and across YREB and its provinces. The SDG Index defines an integrated score representing the overall performance towards achieving all evaluated SDGs, which can be calculated using the following formula (Eq. 3 ):(3) SDG  Index = ∑ j = 1  m  SDG j   m         3 Results 3.1 Temporal and spatial variations of ESs 3.1.1 Characteristics of temporal development According to the diverse ES assessment models constructed in Section 2.3 , we quantitatively measured the biomass of various ESs in 2000 and 2015, and analysed their change trends at the YREB and provincial levels (Fig. 6  ). From 2000 to 2015, provisioning services such as food provision and water provision showed an obvious increased trend, while regulation and supporting services including soil retention, carbon storage, and habitat quality and biodiversity conservation service, presented various degrees of downward trend at the YREB level. Specifically, the grain yield per unit area and annual average water yield in the whole YREB increased from 13.28 × 108  kcal/km2  and 693 mm in 2000 to 15.14 × 108  kcal/km2  and 745 mm in 2015, with increase rates of 14% and 7.6% respectively. With regard to the soil conservation service, the values of soil retention per unit area and total soil retention in the YREB declined from 324 t/km2  and 6.6 × 108  t in 2000 to 305 t/km2  and 6.2 × 108  t respectively. The changing trend of the values of carbon storage and habitat quality was essentially consistent, showing a slight downward trend, with decreases of 1.05% and 4.75%, respectively. From the perspective of the inter-provincial ES differences within the YREB, the biophysical supplies of various ESs in each province have increased or decreased in different degrees over the past 15 years. Regarding food provision, the five provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan provinces had the highest food yield per unit area, exceeding 12 × 108  kcal/km2  both in 2000 and 2015, and the growth rates were prodigious, with values of over 20%. Although the grain provision capacity in Chongqing, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan were both relatively low, they improved steadily from 2000 to 2015. In contrast, the grain yields per unit area in Shanghai and Zhejiang exhibited a significant decline from 2000 to 2015, with decrease rates of 17% and 40%, respectively. Except for Shanghai and Yunnan, the water provision capacity of other provinces increased to varying degrees over the past 15 years. Specifically, the water provision capacity of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang increased substantially, by 197 mm (increase rate: 18.5%), 163 mm (increase rate: 19.9%), and 100 mm (increase rate: 14.8%), respectively. In comparison, the water provision capacity of Jiangsu, Sichuan, and Guiyang increased slightly with a maximum increase rate of 2.5%. The soil retention capacity varied significantly among provinces within the YREB. The soil retention capacities of Zhejiang, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Chongqing were relatively high; in 2000, their soil retention capacities per unit area were higher than 400 t/km2 . Contrastingly, the soil retention capacities per unit area in Shanghai and Jiangsu were lower than 30 t/km2 , accounting for merely 10% of that of the YREB. In addition, the change trends of soil retention in different provinces over time also varied. Among them, Chongqing, Yunnan, Sichuan, Hubei, and Guizhou presented the same temporal development trend as the entire YREB. The soil retention capacity continued to gradually decline, with decrease rates ranging from 4% (Guizhou) to 16.3% (Yunnan); other provinces showed an upward trend, with growth rates ranging from 7.2% (Hunan) to 33.7% (Anhui). The remaining two ESs, carbon storage and habitat quality, have similar inter-provincial differences and development trends over time. In general, the total amount of carbon sequestration and the values of habitat quality in all provinces within the YREB have declined to varying degrees from 2000 to 2015. Among them, Shanghai and Jiangsu lag behind other provinces in total carbon storage and habitat quality, and face rapid rates of decline.  3.1.2 Characteristics of spatial variation Using the various ES assessment models introduced in Section 2.3 , we calculated the ESs in the YREB in a 1-km grid from 2000 to 2015, and used ArcGIS 10.3 software for explicit spatial mapping and visualization. The spatial distribution and difference between 2000 and 2015 of ESs is shown in Fig. 7  . Regarding food provision, the grain yield per unit area was relatively high in the middle–lower Yangtze plains located in the north-eastern and central YREB, but was relatively low in the mountainous and hilly areas located in the south-eastern and western YREB. From 2000 to 2015, the spatial range of agricultural land with a high grain yield expanded marginally, particularly in the Jianghan Plain and Poyang Lake Plain mainly located in Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi. In contrast, the grain yield decreased slightly in the hilly regions in Zhejiang. The spatial variation of water provision varied significantly across the YREB. Specifically, the spatial distribution characteristics of annual water provision present a gradual decrease occurring from the southeast region of the YREB to the northwest region in both 2000 and 2015. Moreover, as shown in the spatial distribution of water provision change, the areas where water resources increased from 2000 to 2015 mainly occurred in Zhejiang, Shanghai and Jiangsu and Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Eastern Hubei. The areas where water resources have decreased were mainly concentrated in Sichuan, Yunnan, Chongqing, etc. Across the YREB, the soil retention capacity was high in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and the hilly and mountainous areas in the south-eastern YREB, but was low in plain areas along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. From 2000 to 2015, the variation trend in the soil retention capacity in the western YREB (including Chongqing, Sichuan, and Yunnan) showed a significant decrease. In contrast, the soil retention capacities per unit area in the eastern YREB (particularly in Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi) continued to increase, specifically by more than 45 t/km2 . Overall, the spatial distribution pattern of carbon storage in the YREB was characterised by high carbon storage in the south and west, but low carbon storage in the north and east. This distribution feature is closely related to the fact that the land cover in hilly and mountainous areas in the south-western YREB is dominated by natural vegetation (e.g., forests and grass), resulting in high carbon storage capacities of ecosystems. From 2000 to 2015, the decrease in carbon storage mainly occurred in the peripheral areas of cities; such decreases occur upon the intrusion of construction land into ecosystems, such as croplands, woodlands, and grasslands. The habitat quality index reflects the degree of fragmentation of regional habitat patches and the resistance to habitat degradation caused by anthropogenic activities. As shown in Fig. 7 , the spatial distribution indicates that regions with a high habitat quality index are mainly distributed in forest areas in the south-eastern, central, and western YREB, whereas the habitat quality index is relatively low in the central and eastern YREB. From 2000 to 2015, the habitat quality index of the entire YREB decreased significantly due to the emergence of large city clusters and the rapid expansion of construction land in the YREB. From the perspective of the change in habitat quality, the area with the most significant growth was mainly distributed in Sichuan, whereas the regions exhibiting significant decline were mainly located in Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Hubei.   3.2 Temporal and spatial changes in SDG and SDG index scores 3.2.1 Temporal dynamics According to the standardized values of ESs (see the Supplementary Information), we used the quantitative equation presented in Section 2.4  for calculating the SDG and SDG Index scores at the YREB and provincial levels. The resulting SDG and SDG Index scores ranged from 0 to 100, with 100 and 0 representing the best and the worst performance of sustainable development, respectively. Our results show that the SDG Index score and all individual SDG scores in the whole YREB continued to increase gradually (Fig. 8  ). Specifically, the SDG Index score of the YREB increased by 10% from 48.05 in 2000 to 52.83 in 2015. From 2000 to 2015, the SDG 12 score increased most significantly (by 13.25); the SDG 11 score increased the least (by only 0.52), and other SDG scores increased by values ranging from 1.26–6.81. At the provincial scale, SDG and SDG Index scores presented significant different temporal change characteristics across provinces within the YREB. From 2000 to 2015, SDG Index scores of 9 of the 11 provinces in the YREB increased, while the scores of the remaining 2 provinces, namely Shanghai and Zhejiang, decreased gradually. The change in SDG Index scores among 9 advanced provinces ranged from a 4.4% increase (Chongqing) to a 48.2% increase (Anhui). However, the SDG Index scores in Shanghai and Zhejiang decreased by 32.4% and 19.7%, with reductions of 10.24 and 12.54, respectively. Regarding individual SDG processes, all the evaluated SDG scores increased in Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, and Guizhou, whereas these scores decreased gradually in Shanghai. In Zhejiang, only SDG 7, SDG 9, and SDG 11 improved from 2000 to 2015, while the scores of the remaining nine SDGs reduced gradually. Moreover, the SDG 7, SDG 9 and SDG 11 scores in Yunnan and Jiangsu decreased from 2000 to 2015, whereas the remaining nine SDGs improved gradually. In Chongqing and Sichuan, the scores of SDG 6 and SDG 15 decreased by 1.3% and 2.5%, respectively, while the scores of the remaining SDGs improved from 2000 to 2015.  3.2.2 Spatial variations The SDG and SDG Index scores exhibited significant spatial variation across the YREB. In general, the SDG Index scores and SDG scores in the central YREB (e.g., Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei) were highest, followed by those in the western YREB (e.g., Yunan, Guizhou, and Chongqing) and eastern YREB (e.g., Shanghai and Jiangsu) (Fig. 8 ). In 2000 and 2015, Jiangxi and Hunan possessed higher SDG and SDG Index scores than the other provinces in both 2000 and 2015. The scores of all SDGs ranged from 47.68 (SDG 12, Jiangxi) to 87.15 (SDG 7, Jiangxi) with an SDG Index value of 68.63 (Hunan) in 2000. In 2015, they ranged from 76.15 (SDG 11, Hunan) to 98.54 (SDG 7, Jiangxi) with an SDG Index value of 86.1 (Jiangxi). In sharp contrast to the above two provinces, most of the SDG scores of Shanghai and Jiangsu provinces, located in the eastern YREB, were lagging. In addition, the western provinces such as Chongqing, Guizhou, and Yunnan performed poorly in SDG 12, SDG 1, and SDG 3, and were far behind the average level of the YREB. Furthermore, there are obvious regional differences in the spatial pattern of changes in the SDG and SDG Index scores. From 2000 to 2015, as shown in Fig. 8 c, the SDG Index values of Shanghai and Zhejiang show a clear downward trend, while the remaining provinces show an increasing trend. In particular, the provinces including Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei exhibit obviously increases in SDG Index values, with growth ranging from 10.1 (Hubei) to 17.92 (Anhui). In summary, we mapped the spatial patterns of the SDG Index scores and differences between 2000 and 2015. These can be understood relatively intuitively by combining the spatial distribution of provincial administrative regions with the SDG scores. It is clear that the spatial distribution and variation characteristics of individual SDGs correspond with the spatial characteristics of SDG Index scores in the YREB over the past 15 years.    4 Discussion 4.1 ES changes and its impact on SDG Index ES services originate from the structure and components of ecosystems, and the processes and functions formed by their interactions (biology, physics, and chemistry). Changes in land use and land cover directly alter ecosystem structures and impact the global and regional climate, hydrology, biodiversity, and biogeochemical cycles. This is the driving force altering the ecosystem functions or services that is most susceptible to human intervention. Our results show that the dominant feature of ecological structure evolution in the YREB is urban sprawl and the decrease in cropland and woodland from 2000 to 2015. Rapid urbanization directly results in a series of eco-environmental problems, such as vegetation destruction, water deterioration and decrease of biological diversity. This directly influences regional ecological functions and impacts efforts for sustainable development. Conversely, land use changes can indirectly affect other services by changing one ecosystem service, because of the complex relationship between multiple ESs (Gerecke et al., 2019 ; Goldstein et al., 2012 ). Specifically, in the YREB, rapid urbanization led to continuous expansion of city sizes along with the expropriation and conversion of a large quantity of the surrounding high-quality cultivated land. However, to feed a growing population, these limited land resources ideally should be continuously developed and utilized to achieve higher productions and benefits. The food production capacity per unit area in the YREB increased from 13.28 × 108  kcal/km2  to 15.14 × 108  kcal/km2  between 2000 and 2015. Statistically, the chemical fertilizer, pesticide, and agricultural plastic film usage in the YREB increased from 1743 × 104  t, 59.5 × 104  t, and 48.12 × 104  t in 2000, to 2163 × 104  t, 73.6 × 104  t, and 84.58 × 104  t in 2015, with growth rates of 24.1%, 23.9%, and 75.8% respectively. From this, we argue that technological development and agriculture investment have greatly promoted the food production capacity per unit area. However, this also inevitably results in a series of eco-environmental problems including water and soil erosion, water pollution, and decreases in biological diversity. As a consequence of the reduction in natural forest area and the expansion of urbanization, various ESs such as carbon storage, soil retention, and habitat quality exhibited decreasing trends during 2000 to 2015. As an important basis for achieving SDGs, temporal and spatial changes in ESs also significantly affect the regional sustainable development levels. The assessment results show that the scores of individual SDGs and the SDG Index in the YREB increased from 2000 to 2015, indicating that sustainable development levels in the YREB have continued to improve. Based on the contributions of ESs to SDGs, we found that food provision and water service are the two most crucial elements for promoting SDGs scores of the YREB over the past 15 years. Food and water provision experienced an increasing trend from 2000 to 2015, with growth rates of 14% and 7.6%, respectively (Fig. 6 ). Furthermore, because the provisioning ES involves the largest numbers of individual SDGs, this simultaneously strongly supported 8 SDGs among the 12 SGDs evaluated in this case study (Fig. 5 ). Nevertheless, we strongly oppose the blind pursuit of the maximization of a specific provisioning service, ignoring its trade-off effect on other services. To synchronously fulfil multiple SDGs, maintaining or enhancing a suite of important ESs through the land use management and conservation is crucial, considering synergies (i.e. mutual promotions) and trade-offs (i.e. mutual offsets) among ESs (Johnson et al., 2019 ; Wood et al., 2018 ; Yang et al., 2020 ). We suggest that to ensure the health and stability of the ecosystem and continuous provision of a wider range of ESs, thereby enhancing regional sustainable development, government policymakers should focus on the following aspects to conduct ES-based land use management and conservation in the future. First, strictly implement the ecological red line policy (in the ecological red line area, all human life and production activities are prohibited) and strengthen the protection of important ecological spaces. Based on the ES method, identify such spaces that can provide various high-quality ESs and biodiversity conservation. These important ecological spaces and complete nature reserves (national parks, wildlife sanctuary, forests, and geological parks, etc.) should be incorporated into the ecological protection red line area for strict management and control. Second, ecological integrated restoration and management should be conducted in natural ecologically fragile areas and degraded areas affected by anthropogenic activities by using the Nature-based Solutions (NbS), for improving the quality and stability of ecosystems. Third, prioritizing cultivated land protection and strengthening the quality construction of permanent basic farmland and well-facilitated farmland is necessary. Fourth, optimize the layout and functional structure of constructive land and delimit urban development boundaries, prevent the disorderly expansion and sprawl of cities and towns, and minimize the negative impacts of urban sprawl on ESs.  4.2 Strengths and limitations This study provides a novel ES-based approach for measuring regional progress towards the environment-related SDGs. We selected the YREB for a case study, and tested this quantitative method and analysed the spatiotemporal patterns of SDGs progress across the YREB and its provinces. The main strengths and contributions of the assessment framework presented in this research are as follows. First, the ES-based approach provides a new perspective for an in-depth understanding of the contributions of ecosystems to human well-being and serves as a novel tool for monitoring progress in achieving SDGs. Second, ESs are selected as comprehensive indicators for assessing the spatiotemporal progress in achieving SDGs. To a certain extent, this method compensates for the lack of evaluation indicators of environmental dimensions in the current indicator system, and emphasizes the critically fundamental role of the ecological environment and of ESs in achieving SDGs. Third, it can effectively fill data gaps when assessing the regional progress of achieving SDGs. Earth observation-based ES indicators have the advantages of wide ranges (across local to global level), fast acquisition speed, and short periods. Therefore, such indicators that integrate socio-economic and environmental data can help fill gaps in environmental indicators and monitoring data for SDGs. Fourth, the methods outlined in our paper are of value to the global monitoring efforts with regard to the 2030 Agenda for SDGs, and can offer an important foundation and effective technique for analysing spatiotemporal patterns of SDG progress across local to global levels. However, this study has some limitations that need to be addressed. First, the cascade model is a highly generalised conceptual model, but the logical relationships and interactive feedback mechanisms are more complex than those represented by the conceptual diagram. In this case study of the YREB, we selected five types of ESs, limiting the comprehensiveness and certainty of the SDG assessment. We used varied eco-environmental data (e.g., data related to meteorology, soil, and changes in land use and cover) to indicate ESs in the YREB. However, the indicators selected in the case study for SDG evaluation were biased towards the facilitation of ESs and did not consider their socioeconomic demands or uses. Second, actions or measures taken in certain regions may produce a spillover effect on the sustainable development of other regions in the YREB (Liu et al., 2015 ; Xu et al., 2020b ). For instance, according to the seventh national population census, Shanghai has a resident population of over 24.87 million, but a territorial area of only 6340 km2 . Shanghai largely relies on the supply of resources from neighbouring provinces or the remote upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Along with inter-regional commodity trade, large quantities of resources (such as grain and water) are transferred to Shanghai; consequently, this not only satisfies the local needs of Shanghai, but also aggravates the shortage of grain and water resources in the exporting provinces. In addition, some high-consumption and extensive processing and manufacturing industries have been eliminated in Shanghai and relocated to neighbouring regions or the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. These changes brought about economic development and environmental pollution and degraded the ecology and ESs of the destinations. The development of water conservancy and hydropower in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has greatly impacted water resource reserves, flood management, ecological environment, and animal habitats in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River (Chen et al., 2020b ; Zhang et al., 2019 ; Zhao et al., 2017 ). However, the spillover effect was not analysed comprehensively in this study.  4.3 Future research directions Considering these limitations, we believe that future research should focus on the following aspects. First, subsequent studies need to be conducted to further expand the scope of the assessed ESs, especially to include more relevant indicators that can reflect social equity and economic development (e.g., cultural services such as recreation and tourism). Such ESs provide human beings with spiritual pleasure and enjoyment, and also promote the prosperity of tourism industry and generate immense economic income. Funded by the European Union, the ongoing “Natural Capital Accounting and ESs Valuation” project has been jointly launched by multiple organisations (including the UNSD, the United Nations Environment Programme, and the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity). This project is intended to help participating countries assess key target fields of related policies and data availability and to formulate national plans for information systems that support sustainable development. As one of the five pilot countries selected, China has formulated and issued Technical Specifications for Ecosystem Assessment and Gross Ecosystem Product Accounting  (State Administration of Market Supervision and Standardization Administration, 2020 ), which covers 3 ESs in Category I (material products, regulation services, and cultural services) and 21 ESs in Category II (Ouyang et al., 2020 ; Zou et al., 2020 ). Thus, we strongly recommend incorporating the SDG assessment framework-based ES approach into the ecological capital and service accounting platform and applying it over a wider scope (specifically, nationwide, or even global). Considering ESs as essential indicators for evaluating the progress of achieving SDGs at different scales is crucial. Moreover, subsequent studies may quantify ES demands according to socioeconomic data (e.g., demographic data) or by using methods such as interviews, surveys, or modelling, and create composite indicators concerning both the supply and demand of ESs (Cochran et al., 2020 ; Geijzendorffer et al., 2017 ). To study the ES flow, it is essential to establish spatiotemporal connections between the supplies and demands of ESs, and to ascertain the accessibility of benefits from ESs (Chen et al., 2020a ). Therefore, conducting a regional analysis on the spatial simulation, mapping ES flows, and increasing the cognition and understanding of inter-regional spillover effects of ESs and SDGs are necessary; such investigations can assist decision-makers with resource management and sustainable development planning.   5 Conclusions The UN's SDGs cover economic, social, and environmental dimensions. Fulfilling these SDGs fundamentally relies on a healthy ecological environment, and stable and continuous ecosystem output. Investigating the contributions of ESs to the fulfilment of SDGs in greater depth and breadth is necessary. Based on the ES cascade model, we proposed an ES-based approach for measuring regional process of achieving the environment-related SDGs and conducted an empirical study in the YREB of China. We calculated and analysed the spatiotemporal patterns of the progress of SDGs from 2000 to 2015 across the YREB and its provinces, revealing that provisioning services including food and water provision made great contributions towards fulfilling SDGs. The SDG Index score in the YREB increased significantly, specifically from 48.05 in 2000 to 52.83 in 2015. Likewise, the scores of all assessed individual SDGs increased to varying degrees. Among all the SDG scores, the SDG 12 score had the highest increment (13.25), whereas the SDG 11 score had the lowest increment (0.52). Evidently, the sustainable development levels in the YREB have continued to improve. Among the 11 provincial regions in the YREB, the SDG Index scores of nine provincial regions gradually increased. The scores of all assessed individual SDGs presented marked spatiotemporal variation. From 2000 to 2015, the scores of 12 SDGs all increased in multiple provinces (including the Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, and Guizhou provinces), but decreased sharply in Shanghai. The systematic approach outlined herein is of value to the global monitoring efforts to the 2030 Agenda for SDGs, potentially offering an important foundation and effective way for analysing spatiotemporal patterns of SDG progress across local to global scales. We also encourage the use of more comprehensive and standardized assessment data for ES indicators (e.g., gross ecosystem product accounting) for accurately identifying spatiotemporal progress towards SDGs across local to global scales.
