                  In the quest to address economic and environmental issues, the UNDP emphasized generating synergy among various sustainable development goals (SDGs). In this regard, SDG4 (Quality of education) is the most crucial SDG, as human capital may help improve the quality of life and environment in the long run. Against this backdrop, this study explores human capital's direct and moderating effect on carbon emissions in nine leading carbon emitter nations from 1990 to 2018. We rely on a quantile approach to calculate elasticity coefficients and verify results using the cross-sectional-autoregressive-distributed lag (CS-ARDL) procedure. The results suggest that human capital leads to carbon emissions across quantiles when the direct impact of human capital on carbon emissions is assessed. Similarly, human capital helps navigate carbon emissions when interacting with industrial value-added and per-capita income. The association between the squared term of human capital and carbon emissions is negative across quantiles in leading carbon emitter nations. Besides investing in human capital, these nations need to intensify the usage of cleaner energy and advanced technologies because the elasticity coefficients of these variables are found to be negative across quantiles. We propose a sustainable growth roadmap in which interconnectedness among certain SDGs is considered.

Handling Editor: Janice A. Beecher In the quest to address economic and environmental issues, the UNDP emphasized generating synergy among various sustainable development goals (SDGs). In this regard, SDG4 (Quality of education) is the most crucial SDG, as human capital may help improve the quality of life and environment in the long run. Against this backdrop, this study explores human capital's direct and moderating effect on carbon emissions in nine leading carbon emitter nations from 1990 to 2018. We rely on a quantile approach to calculate elasticity coefficients and verify results using the cross-sectional-autoregressive-distributed lag (CS-ARDL) procedure. The results suggest that human capital leads to carbon emissions across quantiles when the direct impact of human capital on carbon emissions is assessed. Similarly, human capital helps navigate carbon emissions when interacting with industrial value-added and per-capita income. The association between the squared term of human capital and carbon emissions is negative across quantiles in leading carbon emitter nations. Besides investing in human capital, these nations need to intensify the usage of cleaner energy and advanced technologies because the elasticity coefficients of these variables are found to be negative across quantiles. We propose a sustainable growth roadmap in which interconnectedness among certain SDGs is considered.

However, in recent years, human capital development or investment in human resources has also been considered necessary for higher economic growth as a skilled labor force enables industrial units to utilize modern production processes, develop new ways of production, and minimize industrial wastes (Sharma et al., 2022 ; Yao et al., 2020 ). In contrast, an unskilled labor force in a dynamic economic environment elevates negative externalities such as reduced labor productivity, increased industrial waste, and an unhygienic work environment (Khan, 2020 ). Therefore, it may not be wrong to affirm that industrial units operating with advanced production processes and skilled labor force may strengthen the region's economic growth and established ecosystem (Siddiqui et al., 2022 ; Sinha et al., 2020 ). Moreover, without improvement in the technical and vocational education levels, the widespread usage of modern technology may not be possible (Chen et al., 2021 ). Therefore, complementarity between physical and human capital may help industries to maximize production with minimum effort. Subsequently, a skilled labor force may elevate per capita income, improving their quality of life. In other words, actions towards the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDG) 4 (quality education) and SDG9 (innovation and industrial infrastructure) may help countries achieve economic and sustainability goals in the long run. However, most countries, especially the industrialized nations, have adopted a pro-growth strategy that has proven harmful to environment (Sharma et al., 2021a ). This has led academicians and policymakers to emphasize taking environmental concerns into account at the industrial level in recent years so that SDG targets can be achieved without derailing economic growth momentum (Shahbaz et al., 2021 ; Shahzad et al., 2021 ). In this regard, studies have recommended increasing human capital stock as companies with a larger pool of human capital are more likely to adhere to environmental norms more stringently (Blackman and &Kildegaard, 2010 ; Yao et al., 2020 ). Similarly, consumers with more formal education in a region prefer recyclable and environmentally safe products. For example, a survey conducted for households in Britain reported that the preference for ecologically safe products among formally educated people is found to be 25% more than less educated consumers (Economic and Social Research Council, 2011 ). However, this association may be influenced by the economic development stage and environmental norms a country or region follows. For example, Edsand and &Broich (2020)  observed that the impact of environmental education in controlling pollution and increasing the level of renewable energy consumption is found to be weak in Columbia. The poorly executed environmental norms appear to cause this weak association between human capital and environmental quality in the country. The outcomes of various studies suggest that human capital may have direct (Cole et al., 2005 ; Wang and &Xu, 2021 ) or indirect impacts (Bano et al., 2018 ; Mahmood et al., 2019 ; Sharma et al., 2021d ) on the established ecosystem owing to the influence of several other factors such as government policy (Dasgupta, 2000 ), stage of economic development (Khan, 2020 ), industrial set-up, and types of energy solutions used at the industrial level (Sharma et al., 2021 ). Thus, from the literature examination, we can infer two different viewpoints; the first viewpoint suggests that the increased investment in human capital may reduce negative externalities. The second viewpoint indicates that an increase in the skilled labor force may enhance the usage of natural and manufactured resources, which may intensify greenhouse gas emissions. Recently, there has been an increased interest among researchers in the sustainability domain towards studying the case of top carbon-emitting countries which contribute substantially to the world GDP (62%), global energy consumption (65%), and global carbon emissions (67%) (Salem et al., 2021 ; Sohail et al., 2022 ; Akadiri and &Adebayo, 2022 ; Zhang et al., 2022 ). In the present work context, the leading carbon-emitting countries in the world provide a good case to test the contradictions discussed. These countries appear to have adopted a pro-growth strategy keeping the environmental and societal targets at the backseat. While examining the issue of leading carbon emitter countries, Mahmood et al. (2019)  observed that income and energy consumption significantly influence carbon emissions. In conformity with this argument, the IEA's report (2017) recommends reducing the extensive usage of carbon-intense energy solutions, especially in industrialized and high-polluter nations. The tradeoff between economic and environmental targets may be navigated by increasing the use of cleaner energy solutions across industries (Sharma and &Kautish, 2020a ; Destek andSinha et al., 2020 ). Moreover, increased investment in human and physical capital is also necessary as both are often found inversely associated with carbon emissions and ecological footprint in the long run (Ahmed and &Wang, 2019 ; Sharma et al., 2021 ). Industries operating with significant human and material capital stocks may not only uplift the production level but also fortify environmental quality (Bano et al., 2018 ). If renewable energy solutions support this combination, then leading carbon emitter countries may simultaneously achieve various socio-economic and environmental goals. Our study considers a panel of nine leading carbon dioxide emitter nations, namely, China, the USA, India, Russia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, Iran, and Canada. The countries have been selected based on the GHG emissions data using Climate Analysis Indicators Tool (CAIT) published by Ge et al. (2021)  which contribute a whopping 66% of the world's total carbon emissions (Nejat et al., 2015 ). Moreover, the integration level between the countries is high in terms of high energy consumption levels induced by high output growth. China is the largest contributor to global CO2  emissions, followed by the United States, India, Russia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, Iran, and Canada. China accounts for about one-fourth of the total GHG emissions with coal being the main source of its energy requirements. The share of United States in total GHG emissions stands at 13 percent with its per capita emission greater than China. While India's contribution to the total emissions is around 6 percent, the covid-induced stimulus packages are expected to raise the emissions significantly in recent times. In terms of human capital, as per the Global Human Capital Index 2017, the selected 9 countries have diverse human capital rankings with US (4) and Germany (6) at the top; Canada (14), Russia (16), Japan (17), South Korea (27), and China (34) in the middle; and India (103) and Iran (104) at the bottom. The biggest challenge for these nations is to reduce fossil fuel consumption at industrial level by 60% to bring the carbon emissions to moderate level. To reduce industrial waste and fossil fuel consumption, industrial units must strengthen both human and physical capital. In the absence of a skilled labor force, the efficacy of these initiatives might not be adequately realized as skilled labor force is a prerequisite for operation of advanced machines. Moreover, it is challenging to generate and disseminate renewable energy to industrial units if a vocationally trained labor force is not available. In other words, skilled human capital is necessary at production and pre-production stages to achieve sustainable economic growth (Mahmood et al., 2019 ). Examining the need for the complementarity between various SDGs, Sinha et al. (2020)  mentioned that the SDG-7 (clean and affordable energy), SDG-9 (industrial innovation and infrastructure), and SDG-8 (economic growth) are required to be addressed before addressing the SDG-13 (combat climate change and its impact). And, for managing SDG-7, the role of quality education and training is very crucial. There appears a significant caveat in these nations because without addressing SDG-4, these nations are perpetually involved in achieving SDG-7 and SDG-8. This strategy might have generated an exodus from SDG-13 in these leading carbon emitter nations. Therefore, the top carbon emitter nations need to focus on SDG-4. Once SDG-4 is achieved, it will help in attaining SDG-7, SDG-8, and subsequently, SDG-13, i.e., combating climate change and its impact. In the absence of synergy between these SDGs, these nations might continue to witness environmental challenges despite a rising per capita income. In this milieu, our first objective is to examine whether human capital could influence the level of carbon emissions in the nine leading carbon emitter nations during the selected study span, i.e.,1990–2018. The second objective is to assess whether an increased level of human capital helps restore air quality. To do so, we introduce linear and squared terms for human capital in the model. Lastly, we intend to examine whether the interaction between human capital and renewable energy supports SDG-13. To do so, the combined effect of human capital and renewable energy on carbon emissions is examined. Industrial value-added, technological innovation, and renewable energy consumption are considered as the control variables because these variables appear to be strongly associated, especially in the context of industrial economies. This study has notable objectives which contribute to the existing literature in following ways: (i) It examines the nonlinear impact of human capital on carbon emissions in the leading carbon emitter nations which remains largely unexplored in the past (Ahmed and &Wang, 2019 ; Sharma et al., 2021 ; Yao et al., 2020 ). (ii), It assesses the moderating impact of human capital on the nexus between cleaner energy and CO2  emissions. (iii), With industrial sector being the primary cause of high pollution levels across leading carbon emitting countries, it introduces industrial value-added, as an indicator of industrial activity, instead of per capita income which has been extensively used in the past studies. (iv), It proposes a framework for addressing SDGs in a systematic manner, instead of addressing simultaneously, helping the leading carbon emitting countries navigate energy and technology-led environmental challenges. Moreover, the framework develops synergy between various SDGs enabling these nations to navigate the economic and ecological challenges. (v), It employs the quantile regression approach which allows investigating the variation in terms of association between dependent and independent variables across quantiles. Our results broadly confirm that human capital leads to reduction in carbon emissions. The remaining paper is structured as follows: Section 2  provides an in-depth review of the existing state of literature. Section 3  discusses the econometric methodology, variables, and data sources. Thereafter, Section 4  discusses the results followed by Section 5  that discusses Conclusions and Implications. In the end, Section 6  summarizes the results followed by limitations and scope for future studies.  2 Literature review and research model 2.1 Human capital and carbon emissions The quality of the input (i.e., human and physical capital) is a crucial factor to realize production efficiency. For sustainable economic growth, this argument is supported by Romer (1990)  and Barro (2001)  in their growth models. A recent report by UNCTAD (2020)  ascertains that developed human capital enhances the production efficiency and builds a sustainable growth environment by reducing the production level wastes. This implies that the nations targeting to achieve sustainability and efficiency in production should pay attention to the aspect of human development. On other hand, if the employed labor force is not well-trained and physical capital used for the production is outdated, it significantly enhances the chances of an increase in environmental pollution (Sharma et al., 2021b ). Specifically, the usage of advanced production processes with technically trained human capital may improve not only their marginal contribution but also environmental efficiency in the long run. This essentially means that besides formal education, post-school training is equally essential for effectively realizing the benefits of human capital (Li et al., 2014 ; Salim et al., 2017 ). The usage of unskilled labor may increase the production as well as the level of per capita income, but industrial units may struggle to comply with environmental standards (UNCTAD, 2020 ). Therefore, to reduce the negative externalities, industrial units need to increase the usage of skilled labor force which likely has twin benefits, i.e. increased production and reduced emissions. The empirical evidence with respect to the association between human capital and environmental quality suggests that there exists an inverted U-shaped association between the two in China for the period 2004–17 (Li and &Xu, 2021 ) and also in case of a panel of 122 countries covering the period 1980–2014 (Khan, 2020 ). However, Abdouli and &Omri (2020)  found a bi-directional causality between human capital, economic growth, carbon emissions, and FDI flows across the Mediterranean countries during the period 1990–2013 whereas Khan et al. (2021)  found a one-way causality from human capital, economic growth, and fiscal decentralization to carbon emissions across 7 OECD countries during the period 1990–2018. The disparities and variations of the findings in the previous literature, thus deserves a re-examination. Furthermore, the study conducted by Ganda (2022)  in context of BRICS nations found a significant positive relationship between human capital and carbon emissions. The comprehensive review of literature supports our arguments and the need for examination of association between the human capital and carbon emissions. Even without skilled human resources, industrial units may enhance the production of goods by employing additional human resources and encouraging existing labor to perform overtime. However, due to weak substitutability among factors of production, such a growth strategy may impose challenges such as reduced marginal production of labor, increased industrial wastes, and inefficient utilization of physical inputs (Pablo-Romero and Sánchez-Braza, 2015 ). Thus, replacing unskilled human resources with skilled ones helps navigate such negative externalities (Kautish et al., 2021 ). Subsequently, with the increased income level, the same trained labor force prefers the consumption of environmentally sustainable products because developed human resources are often found more environmentally conscious than their counterparts (Meyer, 2015 ). The same argument is established by Bano et al. (2018)  in their empirical study for Pakistan, where human capital is found to be reducing the level of carbon emissions. However, their empirical results confirm the absence of short-run causality between the variables. While examining the association between human capital and greenhouse gas emissions, Sharma et al. (2021)  ascertain that human capital helps fortify air quality in the BISTEC region. However, the moderating impact of human capital on the nexus between pesticide use and GHGs emissions is reported as insignificant. Using a long study span (1870–2014), Yao et al. (2020)  report that before 1950, the association between human capital and carbon emissions remains direct. However, after 1950, the increased human capital helped in reducing carbon emissions in the selected OECD countries. The time-varying procedure suggests that the impact of human capital on carbon emissions changed significantly over time. Besides, the additional year of schooling contributes to reducing carbon emissions ranging between 50% and 65.8%. Further, Khan (2020)  found that the efficacy of human capital in preserving environmental quality depends on the level of per capita income, as, at the lower level of income, the impact of human capital on carbon emissions is found direct. On the other hand, at higher income level, the association between carbon emissions and human capital turns indirect. It suggests that the increased human capital supported by high economic growth may help in achieving the environmental and economic goals. Further, Sapci and &Shogren (2018)  proposed that increased environmental pollution may reduce the marginal contribution of human capital in the national income. Even the OECD (2016)  report confirms that increased environmental pollution may deteriorate the quality of human capital as the former may cause respiratory diseases, which in turn can reduce the productive capacity of human capital in the long run.  2.2 Industrialization, non-renewable energy consumption, technological innovation, and carbon emissions The existing research examining the relationship between industrialization and environmental quality reports that industrial expansion enhances the usage of nonrenewable energy solutions, which subsequently raises the level of carbon emissions in the developed and developing nations (Sharma et al., 2021b ; Shi et al., 2019 ; Zafar et al., 2020 ). For example, Liu and &Bae (2018)  find that a 1% increase in industrial value-added elevated the level of carbon emissions by 0.3% in China. To reduce industrial gaseous emissions, the study recommends using cleaner energy solutions at a large scale across industries. In this regard, it is observed that the increased concentration of manufacturing units such as cement, iron & steel, and chemical industries are more harmful to environment as such industries require more energy and emit more harmful gases (Hu et al., 2020 ). In conformity to this notion, Dong et al. (2020)  note that the increased linkages between manufacturing and service industries contribute to reducing carbon emissions. Furthermore, they find that technological innovation moderates the nexus between industrial structure and carbon emissions. Therefore, to reduce the manufacturing-led carbon emissions, the study proposes strengthening the linkages between manufacturing and service industries through technological upgradation. Examining the linkages of renewable energy consumption and technological advancement with carbon emissions, another set of past research report that the widespread usage of renewable energy solutions (Destek and Sinha et al., 2020 ; Wang et al., 2021 ) and technological innovation (Yu and &Du, 2019 ; Zhao et al., 2021 ) lead to a reduction in carbon emissions. Anwar et al. (2021)  confirm the indirect association between carbon emissions and cleaner energy solutions in the 15 Asian nations. While assessing the impact of renewable, nonrenewable, and biomass energy on carbon emissions in N-11 countries, Sinha et al. (2017)  also observe that renewable energy helps in fortifying air quality in the region. Similarly, Sharma et al. (2021b)  confirm that technological up-gradation helped BRICS nations to fortify air quality because the increased usage of modern production processes reduced the marginal consumption of energy resources. In this connection, the study recommends increasing investment in technological innovation to achieve the SDG-13. In contrast, Adams and &Nsiah (2019)  suggest a direct association between cleaner energy and air pollution in the selected Sub-Saharan African nations. Similarly, Saidi and &Omri (2020)  confirm the absence of a causal association between CO2  emissions and renewable energy consumption in leading renewable energy-consuming countries. While examining the firm-level data, Erdogan (2021)  confirms that improved technology in the construction sector reduced carbon emissions in BRICS nations. Likewise, Sharma et al. (2021b)  find an indirect association between technology up-gradation and CO2  emissions in BRICS nations recommending additional investment for energy-sector innovation. However, in the case of low-income countries, Ehigiamusoe and &Dogan (2022)  report that the interaction between per capita income and renewable energy consumption escalates the level of carbon emissions. Similarly, Sinha et al. (2020)  and Jiao et al. (2021)  observe a direct association between technological advancement and carbon emissions in Asia Pacific countries and India. It may, thus, be argued that countries need to be cautious while focussing on investment in technological up-gradation, failing which, it may worsen the environmental quality. Besides, with economic growth, governments should also promote cleaner energy solutions at the household and industrial levels. It may also be noted that human capital can play a vital role in the long run in promoting the production and consumption of cleaner energy solutions.  2.3 Integrating the SDGs In order to propose a sustainable growth strategy that helps countries pursue economic and environmental targets together, there is need to interweave the SDG-4 (the quality of education) around other SDGs. This requires an understanding of the impact of human capital on environmental quality. The existing studies seem to have not incorporated the role of human capital in developing sustainable growth strategies. The present research, firstly, intends to tie these loose threads between SDG-4, SDG-7, SDG-9, and SDG-13 together. A noteworthy study by Biggeri et al. (2019)  which proposes this idea of integrating the SDGs, as an isolated measurement of SDGs will lead to ignoring the compounded and colateral implications of one goal on the other. This process can be partially addressed by the method adopted by the current study through the proposed measurement model. Attempts have been made in the past to adopt an integrated approach towards mapping the trade-offs and the synergistic relationships between the SDGs. For example Griggs et al. (2014)  attempted to integrate food, energy, water, and ecosystem services goals, followed by Horan (2020)  who developed a integrated framework for assessing SDG14 (the conservation and sustainable use of marine resources) for island nations. Taking cue from the literature, we are motivated to adopt the proposed approach in our study. Secondly, by examining the nonlinear impact of human capital on carbon emissions, the study enriches the environmental literature considering that the association between human capital and carbon emissions may tend to change over time. Using the Dumitrescu and Hurlin causality the study by Ganda (2021)  identified, inter alia the threshold value of emissions in response to the increase or decrease in human capital. This study further accentuates the essentiality to examine the trade-off between various SDGs.  2.4 Theoretical underpinning Firms require technological infrastructure, energy solutions, and human resources in order to enhance the production levels. In an endogenous growth model, these inputs may complement each other (Salim et al., 2017 ). The increased income level may further widen the demand for skilled human resources and energy solutions. However, this income effect  may increase not only the need for clean energy but also carbon-intense energy solutions (Yao et al., 2020 ). In such a case, even with developed human resources, due to the income effect, the demand for total energy solutions may witness an upward trend, which in turn, may intensify the level of carbon emissions in the long run (Ehigiamusoe and &Dogan, 2022 ). Secondly, the increased income caused by developed human resources enable households and industries to expand their consumption and production. In both cases, the demand for nonrenewable energy may witness an upward tick if appliances and machinery used at the household and industry levels are not energy efficient. Subsequently, the increased energy demand may exacerbate environmental quality. Another stream of argument proposes that the increased income level may allow households and industries to utilize energy-efficient appliances and production processes as economic growth enables nations to invest in research and development (Churchill et al., 2019 ). However, at this stage, a country requires developed human resources to operate advanced and energy-efficient machinery. In other words, without ensuring the complementarity between human and capital resources, the achievement of production and environmental efficiency may not be possible. The complementarity between human capital and technological innovation may increase the usage of cleaner energy solutions (Cagno and &Trianni, 2013 ), which is termed as ‘technology-effect’ (Yao et al., 2020 ). The IEA (2017)  report also ascertains that the increased investment in technology and human capital could help in reducing the energy demand by up to 25%. It may, thus, be argued that the increased use of skilled human capital and advanced technology may allow leading carbon emitter nations to increase the usage of cleaner energy solutions, consequently reducing CO2  emissions. Table 1   accords the possible association between human capital and carbon emissions taking industrial production and renewable & non-renewable energy into account. Taking cues from the above discussion, we consider human capital and technological innovation as the determinants of carbon emissions. Nevertheless, it may also not be denied that the increased employment of human capital may enhance industrial production and, subsequently, carbon emissions. We, thus, consider industrial value-added as a control variable in carbon emissions function. Next, we examine the long-run association between income and CO2  emissions dropping the industrial value-added from carbon emissions function. This allows us to assess the impact of overall economic activity on carbon emissions. The variables of the study are presented in Table 1 . The present study, thus, captures the effects of income, technology, and human capital on carbon emissions in the nine leading carbon emitter nations.   3 Research methodology 3.1 Data sources and definitions To assess the impact of human capital, renewable energy, technology, and industrial value-added on the proxy of environmental quality (i.e., carbon emissions) in the nine leading carbon emitter nations, the annual data series from 1990 to 2018is considered. In order to assess the impact of overall economic activity, per capita income is introduced as a determinant of carbon emissions in a different model dropping industrial value-added as the inclusion of industrial value-added and per capita income in the same model may invite modeling errors. The annual data series of carbon emissions (m/t), renewable energy (% of total energy), industrial value added (constant USD at 2010 price), and per capita income (constant USD at 2010 price) is retrieved from the official repository of the World Bank, i.e., World Development Indicators (CD-ROM, 2021 ). The Penn World Table version 10.0 provides human capital index, which takes the schooling years and returns to education into account (Feenstra et al., 2015 ). Further, the existing literature suggests that a single proxy for technology advancement may not be sufficient to gauge the technological up-gradation in a country because each proxy may have a different impact across countries (Jiao et al., 2021 ). While technological advancement may reduce industrial wastage through promotion of cleaner production processes (Chen et al., 2020 ; Sharma et al., 2021c ), a pro-growth technological advancement may trigger a rebound effect resulting in increased use of natural resources and generation of industrial wastes in the long-run (Xie et al., 2021 ). For instance, empirical assessment of MENA region suggests that in Bahrain, technology and carbon have a strong direct association in the lower quantile while such an association in Iran was found to be negative across quantiles (Sinha et al., 2020a ). In case of Asia pacific countries, a rebound effect was found as the association between technology and air quality was direct across quintiles (Sinha et al., 2020 ). Thus, to examine the impact of technology on carbon emissions, we used the number of patents and trademarks application filed by the residents each year. The data on both the series are collected from the WDI database and a technology index is constructed using principal component analysis, where due weights are given to each variable. In order to navigate the data contour, natural-log values of the selected variables are used to get the elasticity coefficients. Before computing empirical results, the data series are transformed orthogonally as such transformation navigates the possibility of multicollinearity (See Appendix-A, Table A2 ).  3.2 The baseline model At the outset, Equation-1 examines the impact of human capital, the squared term of human capital, renewable energy, technology, and industrial value-added on carbon emissions.(1) C A E  i t   = a 0  + a 1  H U D  i t   + a 2  H U D  i t  2  + a 3  R E E  i t   + a 4  T E I  i t   + a 5  I V A  i t   + ε  i t        The selection of functional relationships in equation (1)  is motivated by the fact that increased human capital improves the scope of economic activities (Khan, 2020 ). Besides, its consistent improvement may generate production and consumption level efficiencies. In the initial phase, it is expected that the linear term of human capital may exacerbate environmental quality as the increased investment in human capital in the populace economies, in the beginning, may generate more economic benefits than positive environmental externalities. However, the impact of squared term of human capital is expected to support the established ecosystem because the consistent improvement in human capital may sensitize producers and consumers for environmental conservation, which may widen the scope for both kinds of externalities, i.e. economic and environmental. Such a possible association has been ignored in empirical studies in the past. In equation-1, HUD, REE, TEI, and IVA denote carbon emissions, human capital, renewable energy, technological up-gradation, and industrial value-added, respectively. Countries and study periods are indicated using (i ) and (t ) subscripts, respectively.(2) C A E  i t   = a 0  + a 1  H U D  i t   + a 2  R E E  i t   + a 3  T E I  i t   + a 4  I V A  i t   + a 5  H U D * I V A  i t   + ε  i t        In equation (2) , the interaction effect between human capital and industrial value-added on carbon emissions is captured by the value of α5  coefficient. If the value of the interaction coefficient is found negative and significant, it suggests that the usage of human capital improves the environmental quality by employing conscious behavior and reduces production level wastes in the long run.(3) C A E  i t   = a 0  + a 1  H U D  i t   + a 2  H U D  i t  2  + a 3  R E E  i t   + a 4  T E I  i t   + a 5  P E I  i t   + ε  i t        In equation (3) , the industrial value-added is replaced with per capita income in order to examine the impact of overall economic activity on carbon emissions during the study period.(4) C A E  i t   = a 0  + a 1  H U D  i t   + a 2  R E E  i t   + a 3  T E I  i t   + a 4  P E I  i t   + a 5  H U D * P E I  i t   + ε  i t        Lastly, equation (4)  examines the interaction impact of human capital and per capita income on carbon release. Across equations, it is to be noted that both direct and moderating impact of human capital on air quality is intended to assess, as human capital may improve the production and consumption level efficiency directly and indirectly. The variable name and description is provided in Table 2  .  3.3 Computational mechanism 3.3.1 Cross-sectional convergence By employing the battery of second-generation tests, we intended to compute the robust results to propose a practical policy framework to navigate CO2  emissions in the selected countries. In view of the panel data framework being used in the study, there is a possibility of cross-sectional dependence. Moreover, the variables used in the study such as growth, energy and technology are likely to have spillover effects leading to common shocks across nations (Bello et al., 2018 ). Also, in the age of globalization, growing trade-related transactions, across-countries might transmit one country's economic shocks into another (Sharma et al., 2021b ). In such cases, examination of cross-sectional dependency (CD) is important, the presence of which may produce biased and inconsistent results (Phillips and &Sul, 2003 ). Therefore, the possibility of CD is examined using Pesaran's (2004)  and Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test by Breusch and Pegan's (1980)  tests. Pesaran's (2004)  cross-section dependence is applicable in cases with large panel sets and small study period. The computational procedure of CD test is given in Equation (5) .(5) C D = 2 T H   N C S ( N C S − 1  )    ( ∑ i = 1  N C S − 1   ∑ j = i + 1  N C S   ɵ i t    )       Here CD is calculated using time horizon (TH) and the number of cross-sections (NCS). To compute the value of CD test, errors’ cross-sectional correlation (ɵ) is also being considered. The equation used by LM test to examine CD is as follows:(6) y i t   = α i t   + β i  x i t   + ε  i t       where i  denotes cross-sections and t  denotes the year. The null hypothesis under both the tests assumes that there is no cross-sectional dependence. In addition to cross-sectional dependence, it is important to examine the slope homogeneity as the countries under consideration may have diverse socio-economic and demographic structure. We use the slope homogeneity test by Pesaran et al. (2008) to examine the same.  3.3.2 Stability and cointegration tests The significant values of these tests confirm the presence of CD and heterogeneity in the slope parameters which invalidate the usage of regular unit tests such as augmented Dickey and &Fuller (1979)  and Phillips and &Perron (1988) . In this situation, it requires employing those tests that are capable of providing reliable stationarity tests. The “panel second-generation unit root test” considers CD dependency (Moon & Perron 2004; Pesaran, 2007). Therefore, cross-sectionally augmented Dickey-Fuller (CADF) and cross-sectional Im-Pesaran-Shin (CIPS) tests by Pesaran (2007) are employed to validate the data stationarity. Both the tests take cross-sectional and heterogeneity across panel into consideration. The calculation mechanism for the CADF test is given in Equation (7)  hereunder:(7) Δ z  i , t   = γ i  + ρ i  z i , t − 1   + ɵ i  Δ z ‾  t − 1   + β i  Δ z ‾  t  + μ i , t       Here (z ‾    ) = cross-sectional mean values; and z t  ‾  = n − 1   ∑ i = 1  n  z i t      where countries and periods are represented using (i) and (t) subscripts, respectively. Using mean values, the association between various zit  will be circum navigated. The null hypothesis considers ρi  = 0 if ρi  < 0, then the null hypothesis will be rejected. The resulting mean value of the CADF test helps in computation of CIPS test as follows:(8) C I P S = 1 N  ∑ i = 1  N  t i  ( N , T  )        Post examining the CD and stationarity, we employ Westerlund’s (2007) second-generation cointegration test to investigate the long-run association in different carbon functions. The first-generation cointegration techniques are unable to accommodate cross-sectional dependence and hence may produce biased results. The values provided by Westerlund’s (2007) cointegration technique help in ascertaining long-run relationship between the variables. Moreover, this tests provide robust results in the presence of stationary regressors. It provides four distinct values, which can be calculated using bootstrapping approach (Altıntaş and Kassouri, 2020 ). The significant values represent the presence of a long-run association among variables in the long run. The equation used is as follows:(9) Δ W i , t   = α i  T t  + γ i  W i , t − 1   + ρ i  V i , t − 1   + ∑ l = 1  p i   γ i , l   Δ W i , t − 1   +   ∑ l = − q i   p i   β i  V i , t − 1   + μ i , t          Here, if Tt  = (1), the equation carries a constant trend and otherwise if it equals (0). Moreover, it carries both constant and trend if it equals (1, t). Equation (9)  provides a stationary solution by considering the dependency among variables across countries. This requires the error term to be calculated as follows:(10) ε i , t   = γ i  F t  + μ i , t       where F t   is the factor mix, the proxies for which are provided by the average values of CD.  3.3.3 Calculation of elasticity coefficients The relationship of linear and nonlinear terms of human capital with carbon emissions is expected to be significant in either direction. Secondly, as the human capital progresses, the association between human capital and carbon emissions is likely to vary. The quantile regression approach proposed by Koenkar & Bassett (1978) appears to be desirable because this approach has the potential to examine the relationship between two variables at different quantiles or different levels (Koenker, 2005 ) and also has several merits over the least squares estimation method. The assumption of presence of moments function is relaxed in case of quantile approach (Zhu et al., 2016); provides more robust results that remain unaffected by abnormal observations (Bera et al., 2016); does not require to make any distributional assumptions (Sherwood & Wang, 2016) providing more accurate results. The formulation of the quantile regression model is as follows:(11) y i  = x i ′  β θ  + μ θ i   , 0  < θ <  1     (12) Q u a n t  θ  ( y i  | x i   )  = x i  β θ      Where y signifies dependent variable, x denotes a vector of independent variables, and u is a random error term, the conditional quantile distribution of which equals zero. Q u a n t  θ  ( y i  | x i   )  = x i  β θ     indicates the θth quantile of y. The β   _θ is the regression estimator for θth quantile which solves Equation (13) :(13) min ∑ y i  ≥ x i ′  β   θ |   y i  − x i ′  β | + ∑ y i  < x i ′  β   ( 1 − θ  )  |   y i  − x i ′  β  |      when θ takes different values, the other parameter estimates are obtained. Subsequently, to corroborate the quantile approach's results, the panel cross-sectional dependence autoregressive distributed lag model (CS-ARDL) developed by Chudik & Pesaran (2015) is employed, as this approach provides short-run and long-run coefficients with a speed of convergence, checks for any problem of cross-sectional dependency, has the ability to address the endogeneity problem. However, this approach is more sensitive to lag selection. The regression equation for CS-ARDL is as follows:(14) Δ C A E  i t   = μ i  + φ i  ( C A E  i t − 1   − β i  X i t   − φ 1 i   C A E  ‾  t − 1   − φ 2 i   X ‾  t − 1    )  + ∑ j = 1  p − 1   λ i j    Δ C A E  i t − j   + ∑ j = 0  q − 1   ζ i j    Δ X  i t − j   + η 1 i   Δ C A E  ‾  t  + η 2 i   Δ X ‾  t  + ε i t       where j  and t  denote the dimensions of cross section and time, respectively. ΔCAEit   is the dependent variable, Xit   is all the independent variables of the long-run estimate, C A E  ‾  t − 1      and X ‾  t − 1      are the mean of the lagged dependent variable and matrix of the mean of the lagged independent variables, Δ C A E  i t − j      and Δ X  i t − j      are the lagged dependent variable and matrix of the lagged independent variables in the short run, Δ C A E  ‾  t     is the mean of the dependent variable, Δ X ‾  t     is the matrix of the mean of the independent variables, and ε i t      is the error term.    4 Empirical results and discussion Table 3   suggests the presence of inter-country conjunction as the calculated p-values of various tests are found significant. In other words, the rejection of the null hypothesis of the absence of CD in Pesaran's test supports the usage of second-generation tests. We, thus, examine the stochastic properties of the data series using ADF and CIPS tests. Both the tests are reliable in the presence of inter-country convergence and thus have greater explanatory power than traditional tests. The results are mentioned in Table 4   confirm that data series possess the properties of stability during the study period. The rejection of the unit root for the respective data series allows us to examine the long-run association between considered variables. The Westerlund (2007) test results presented in Table 5   indicate that the long-run association between the considered carbon emission functions has remained statistically significant. Stating differently, the respective models based on the considered variables are statistically significant, which allows us to compute the elasticity coefficients. Once cointegration is confirmed, it needs to be ratified that models are free from econometric errors. Table 5  presents the cointegration analysis. The results of various diagnostic tests given in Appendix-A indicate the absence of autocorrelation and data series are homoscedastic. Once cointegration is confirmed, we can proceed to calculate elasticity coefficients. Table 6   exhibits the association between dependent and independent variables at the different quantiles. Taking a cue from the outcomes of Sinha et al. (2020) , we discovered two distinct patterns across quantiles. The first pattern demonstrates the medium level of carbon emissions caused by industrial value-added, which ranges from 10th-40th quantiles. The second pattern from 50th-90th quantiles marks the high level of carbon emissions due to industrial value-added. This suggests that countries with increased industrial production are more susceptible to carbon emissions than countries with less industrial growth. In model (2) also, it is observed that the change in industrialization cause a medium level of carbon emissions up to 40th quantile. Post that, the impact of industrial growth on carbon emissions increased, and the level of tradeoff between industrial growth and carbon emissions widened. In such a situation, it can be ascertained that the increased industrial production imposes a challenge to SDG-13. In terms of sustainability, it may not be wrong to mention that the failure to address SDG-9 might be a catalyst for the incessantly deteriorating air quality in these nations, which raises a question on their economic growth strategy in general and industrial policy particularly. By considering the case of BRICS and Asian nations, Sharma et al. (2021b)  and Zafar et al. (2020) , in their respective studies, confirmed the direct association between industrialization and carbon emissions. However, these studies failed to establish that the medium to high industrial growth was a catalyst for medium to high carbon emissions. While examining the association between per capita income and carbon emissions in Model 3 and 4, we such patterns were absent. However, the coefficients of per capita income across quantiles remain positive and significant in both models. This type of association signifies that economic prosperity leads to environmental pollution in industrialized nations. It may be argued that the economic policies adopted by respective governments may not have generated positive externalities owing to their preference for as financial targets over environmental goals. Such pro-growth strategy may have supported industrial growth at the cost of environmental quality. While exploring the nexus between per capita income and carbon emissions in low-income countries, Ehigiamusoe and &Dogan (2022)  also confirm that the direct impact of per capita income growth on carbon emissions remain positive. But the interaction between per capita income and cleaner energy reduces carbon emissions. In order to seek a solution tothe growing environmental threats, we intended to find out the role of human capital in the selected highly corbon emitting nations. In the countries with medium air pollution, the direct impact of the linear term of human capital on carbon emissions is found low, which can be visualized from the elasticity coefficients of 10th-40th quantiles. On other hand, in the countries with high air pollution, the values of the coefficients of human capital are found relatively high. It may, thus, be argued that countries with high industrial growth may have widened human and natural resources usage. The overuse of natural and human resources may have fortified negative externalities such as industrial solid wastes and gaseous emissions. In this regard, it is suggested that instead of an intensive increase in human capital, the industries should opt for extensive deployment of skilled human resources. With an increase in the deployment of skilled human capital within and across sectors, selected countries may navigate the pollution level as the impact of the squared term of human capital on carbon emissions is found negative in models (I) and model (III). In this regard, another argument may be made that the human capital with poor skills may be unable to deliver with full potential at the workplace (Salim et al., 2017 ). Consequently, it may fail to generate positive economic and environmental externalities. In other words, due to the poor quality of human capital, the level of carbon emissions may keep on increasing. On other hand, a vocationally skilled labor force combined with advanced production processes may significantly fortify environmental quality. The study by Yao et al. (2020)  supports this argument who find that the increased one-year high schooling leads to an increase in carbon emissions by 16.5%. However, the increased one-year tertiary education reduces the level of carbon emissions by 74% in the selected OECD nations. This suggests that in the chosen leading carbon emitter nations, the intensive deployment of a partially skilled labor force may have widened the scope for carbon emissions. However, the increased investment in technology up-gradation and broader usage of skilled labor across industries may have turned the direct association between human capital and carbon emissions into indirect. Therefore, it is important to mention that the increase in quantity and quality of labor force is crucial to achieving production and consumption level sustainability. To corroborate this notion, when the nexus between industrial value-added and carbon emissions are moderated by human capital, the cross elasticity coefficients across quantiles are found negative and significant in model (II). Similarly, the results given in model (IV) report the moderating negative impact of human capital on the nexus between per capita income and carbon emissions. In other words, the level of carbon emissions witnessed a decline when human capital interacted with industrial production and per capita income. Across models, the impacts of renewable energy and technological advancement on carbon emissions are found negative across quantiles. However, in high carbon emitter nations, the efficacy of renewable energy in controlling carbon emissions gradually reduced but remained significant. On other hand, in the high emitter nations, the effectiveness of technological advancement in fortifying air quality gradually increased and remained substantial. It may, thus be argued that the increased industrialization may have strengthened the demand for energy-efficient production processes. But at the same time, these nations may have been forced to widen the usage of nonrenewable energy due to the rapid expansion of industries. Therefore, renewable energy efficacy at the higher quantile reduced, whereas the effectiveness of technological innovation witnessed an improvement in terms of reducing carbon emissions. However, the negative association of renewable energy and technology with carbon emissions is a ray of hope for policymakers. To control the growing air pollution, it is essential to develop a sustainable growth framework where human capital, clean energy, and technological advancement are used strategically. Various empirical studies confirm that cleaner energy usage helps control carbon emissions (Qi et al., 2014 ; Zaman et al., 2021 ) and ecological footprint (Sharma et al., 2021c ). Therefore, while framing the sustainable development roadmap, these studies recommend increasing wind, solar, and hydro energy usage at the industrial and household levels. Figs. 1 and 2    are based on models (1) and (2), respectively. In both the figures, the direct impact of linear human capital developed on carbon emissions is found positive. On other hand, the impact of the nonlinear term of human capital and its interaction with industrial value-added remained negative and significant. The association between income and CO2  emissions may be understood from Table 7  . To verify the results of the quantile procedure, we employed the CS-ARDL approach which is capable of providing reliable short-run and long-run elasticity coefficients after navigating the possibility of the CD. The results given in Table 7  suggest that the linear impact of the human capital term remained direct on carbon emissions. However, the association between the squared term of human capital and carbon emissions is found negative and significant. These results confirm the results of quantile and ordinary least squares results. Similar to quantile results, the CS-ARDL approach confirms that industrial value-added and per capita income contributed to raising the level of carbon emissions in the long run. On other hand, advancements in technological infrastructure and renewable energy consumption fortified air quality in the selected nations. The CS-ARDL results may be considered for policy formulation as the common shocks are navigated while computing the elasticity coefficients. In order to check the robustness of the CS-ARDL results, we use the Augmented Mean Group (AMG) method which is more efficient than many other traditional methods in terms of dealing with the problem of cross-sectional dependence, heterogeneity, and endogeneity problems (Eberhardt, 2012). The results of the same are presented in Table 8  . The robustness check conducted with AMG confirms the results obtained from CS-ARDL. The results suggest that rising industrial value-added and per-capita income contributes to carbon emissions. While increase in human capital contributes to carbon emissions, its squared term is found to be reducing the emission levels. Moreover, technological growth and renewable energy consumption contributes towards reduction in carbon emissions.  5 Conclusions and Implications 5.1 Conclusions To meet the economic targets, countries across the world are indulging in industrial sector expansion. Such a pro-growth strategy, undeniably, has strengthened the economic environment. But at the same time, it has posed certain challenges such as extensive usage of natural resources, energy scarcity, and, more prominently, gaseous emissions. Consequently, the level of carbon emissions in some countries has reached an alarming level, and policymakers find it challenging to address environmental goals. Taking the panel of such top carbon emitter nations, we investigate the impact of human capital on carbon emissions from 1990 to 2018 using industrial value-added, renewable energy, and technology innovation as control variables. Due to the possible economic commonality, we rely on the latest econometric procedures instead of employing traditional stationarity and cointegration tests. The elasticity coefficients are calculated using the bootstrap quantile approach, and these results are corroborated by CS-ARDL mechanism and the AMG analysis. It is evident from the results that from the 50th quantile to 90th quantile, the impact of industrial value-added on carbon emissions remains more severe compared to lower quantiles. Secondly, it is observed that initially, human capital leads to an increase in carbon emissions but gradually improvement in the quality of human resources fortifies air quality in the selected countries, which is evident from the linear and nonlinear association of human capital with carbon emissions. While examining the nexus between industrial value-added and carbon emissions, it is observed that human capital moderates the nexus between industrial value-added and carbon emissions. Stating differently, when more skilled laborers are employed at the industrial level, it helps reduce industrial value-added led carbon emissions. Similarly, the nexus between per capita income and carbon emissions is moderated by human capital. It suggests that the leading carbon emitting nations need to nurture human capital so that the production and consumption-led positive externalities may be realized and these nations may navigate the growing carbon emissions in the coming years. As far as the impact of renewable energy and technological innovation on carbon emissions is concerned, both are found to help in reducing carbon emissions in the long run. This is evident from the quantile and CS-ARDL results as the coefficients of both variables are found negative and significant. For designing a sustainable roadmap, our results may provide important insight to policymakers. The proposed strategy highlights the need for technical education as research and development in the energy and industrial sectors may not be possible without developing endogenous human resources. Moreover, without generating energy efficiency and production efficiency, the environmental conservation drive may remain a dream for these nations.  5.2 Policy implications It is evident from the direct and significant impact of industrial value-added that the industrial units are focussing on production without considering the environmental issues (Sharma and Kautish, 2020 ). Due to the extensive usage of carbon-intense energy solutions for production and consumption, these nations are witnessing increasing carbon emissions which also suggests that the economic prosperity's spillover impact on the established ecosystem is yet to be realized. However, by investing in human capital, renewable energy generation, and technological innovation, these nations may achieve economic growth with a sustainable environment. To achieve the same, a multipronged road map needs to be developed, which requires weaving around various sustainable development goals instead of focussing on any one of the SDGswhich may derail the progress of other SDGs. This implies that policy level changes are desired at energy consumption, specifically carbon neutral energy sources are desired to be explored for industrial activities. In this pursuit a better balance between economic activites and environmental sustainability can be achived by the nations. Our results (Model 2) indicate that rapid industrial development has taken a toll on the environment, increasing emission and large scale destruction of environment. This implies that the policy in regards to utilization of industrial energy needs to prioritise sustainability and hence industrial units should be gradually shifting to cleaner energy sources reducing dependence on fossil fuels. While the shift to cleaner energy is imperative, it is to be remembered that a sudden migration from fossil energy to renewable energy may impede the economic growth progress in general and the generation of employment in particular. Because people working in nonrenewable energy generation and associated industries may lose job opportunities if a sharp migration is followed. Secondly, extensive renewable energy production and subsequent consumption may not be possible without developing endogenous renewable energy infrastructure. In other words, it may have a repercussive negative spillover impact on the industrial production, job market, and energy sector. Therefore, in pursuit to achieve SDG-7 (affordable and clean energy) and SDG-13 (environment conservation), these nations may need to compromise with SDG-8 (economic growth). Therefore, these nations need to begin with investing in technological up-gradation so that the industrial units migrate easily from dirty to clean energy without disturbing the growth momentum. However, establishing the required technical infrastructure may not be possible in the absence of a vocationally trained labor force. The target to achieve rapid production with low waste may be achieved by developing vocationally qualified human resources because educated people are often found more sensitive to environmental conservation than others. Secondly, for invigorating the research and development in renewable energy and industrial sectors, vocationally trained human capital is a prerequisite. The analysis has also indicated that mere human development without deployment of skilled labour and innovative production techniques will not help reduce the emission levels. Thus, these nations need to first work on SDG-4 (quality education). In other words, to develop the human capital, respective governments need to imbibe the vocational and technical education in their school curricula. If required, the school syllabi to be aligned with industrial requirements. By doing so, firstly, their employment prospects will improve. Secondly, technically trained people will help industries achieve economies of scale with minimal industrial waste. To finance the new vocational institute, governments may impose additional taxes on the dirtiest industries based on their contribution to carbon emissions. This strategy will have threefold benefits; firstly, it will generate more employment prospects in vocational institutes; secondly, it will put the dirtiest industries in the ambit of environmental laws. Thirdly, it will encourage enterprises to reduce their carbon emissions so that carbon taxes may be avoided. However, the core industries such as iron and steel, and cement should be omitted from such taxes as100% transfer from non-renewable to renewable energy in these industries may not be possible at this stage due to slow pace of innovation in energy transitions to cleaner fuels. However, for such enterprises, the energy-mix strategy may be followed. In other words, activities that can be performed using cleaner energy should be carried out using solar, wind, and hydro energy, whereas other procedures can be continued using coal or oil energy. An important policy perspective emerges from the analysis of the models, is the role of government on energy transitioning process and human capital development. The respective governments should invest in renewable energy generation, where technologically trained people can play a crucial role. The industries ready to switch from nonrenewable energy should be given financial and technical support at this stage. At the same time, governments need to apportion separate budgets to generate cleaner energy infrastructure and R&D. Governments may collect additional money to support these endeavors from industries that are strategically least important but high carbon emitters. Once renewable energy-based industries become operative, these additional taxes may be gradually removed. However, for the success of such migration, endogenous human and technological resources are much needed, in the absence of which, it will reduce job opportunities and increase the cost of production. At this stage, once again, vocational education may play a crucial role in developing renewable energy, employment opportunities, and subsequently, additional tax receipts. With respect to the SDGs this study makes some vital directions for policy formulation. The aim for an integrated approach towards achieving SDGs is what the policy directions for the nations under study is primarily suggested. Thus, human capital (SDG-4) and renewable energy generation (SDG-7) must be aimed at in first stage as a policy. It is further suggested that the government policy must be taken to the second stage and other industries that can be migrated from dirty to clean energy should be targeted; and, the job loss caused by the technology shift can be absorbed by creating new employment opportunities in renewable energy, vocational training, and research and development sectors. With the help of human capital, once the commercial viability of cleaner energy is achieved, industries will automatically prefer to operate with renewable energy solutions because it will reduce their cost of production without impeding their productivity. However, for the extensive application of renewable energy at the industrial level, industrial units need to embrace technologies compatible with cleaner energy. To do so, technically trained human resources are much needed. Otherwise, imported technology may increase the cost of production, and firms may lose market competitiveness in the long run. Once this shift to renewable energy generation and usage begin to support (SDG-7) and subsequently through human development efforts supporting SDG-9 there will be trickle down effect on the SDG-13 nd SDG-8. Summarily, increased usage of renewable energy, innovation in energy and industrial sectors, and human capital are the three policy tools to counter the growing carbon emissions. But any single tool working in isolation may not be sufficient to address the environmental challenges. In fact, for the success of the two former policy tools, human capital is a prerequisite as vocationally trained human resources will enable these nations to commercialize the usage of renewable energy and establish the research environment. If these three tools are synchronized then the goals to achieve cleaner energy, industrial innovation, sustainable economic growth, and subsequently cleaner environment will not be difficult to achieve.  5.3 Implications for practice The result analysis in the study has some useful insights for the corporate and practice professionals both from public and private sectors. It has been found in the study that development of human capital has a significant advantage from the sustainability perspective. Hence the industries must develop human resources that can work towards development of energy efficient production systems. This implies that the investments in research and development is deemed necessary for the industries (Sharma and Kautish, 2019 ). The second important implication for practitioners emantes from perspective of procuring machineries and equipments which are less dependent on the fossil fuel and use cleaner energy for production. Transitioning to the cleaner fuel will help industries in building sustainability through reduced dependence on the carbon emitting sources and contributing to the nations effort in decreasing the carbon footprint. The third aspect that influences the practice relates to the enhancement in firm's public image due to eco-friendly production practices. This provides the firms in the industry to position itself and its products as environment-friendly helping in differentiation and effectively beating the competitors.  5.4 Policy caveats For the success of the our proposed roadmap, the active contribution of various stakeholders is expected. For example, the governments should first improve the quality of education taking the need of industries into account. The quality of education is crucial for generating a conducive environment for research and development in these nations. This process shall help in developing exceptional and high-skilled professionals who can develop innovative solutions to problems of the industrialized nations. Secondly, the governments should have ample financial resources to support vocation training programs, which appears to be a major cause of concern. Thirdly, industrial units and consumers need to be sensitive towards environmental conservation drives. Fourth, governments should have the required financial and technological resources to establish renewable energy infrastructure. And lastly, these nations should build capacity to produce a technically trained labor force for executing the planned actions for realizing the targeted outcomes. To sum up, the target to achieve SDG-13 may not be possible without addressing SDG-7 and SDG-9 and the success of these two is heavily dependent on human resources development and ultimately accomplishing SDG-8.   6 Limitations and future research roadmap The limitation of the study lies in its theoretical framework. Due to the limited scope of the research objective, a broader policy paradigm may not be addressed. Such restriction is reflected in terms of the parameter selection of the empirical model. Although the model does not demonstrate any kind of estimation issues/biases, having a broader policy objectives and its subsequent parameterization would have enriched the scope of the study. Additionally, while examining the association between human capital and industrial value-added, the segregation of industries into high carbon-intense and low carbon-intense may provide a better understanding of the phenomenon under consideration. Secondly, data unavailability compelled us to ignore the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on carbon emissions. Therefore, by including variables related to government policy and the structural composition of industries, studies in the future may help enrich the existing literature.
