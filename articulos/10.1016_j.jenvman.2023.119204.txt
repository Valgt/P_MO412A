                  This paper is likely the first attempt to empirically investigate the direct effect of geopolitical risk on sustainable development goals (SDGs). We employ a newly developed SDG index along with its 17 sub-indices from the United Nations to capture various aspects of sustainable development. On a panel sample covering 41 countries from 2015 to 2021, we find that elevated geopolitical tensions can hinder the progress towards achieving sustainable development goals. This result is robust to various model specifications and estimation approaches. Further analyses show that the two dimensions affected are Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG8) and Climate Action (SDG13). Heterogeneity test finds that the negative effect of geopolitical risks is only present in countries highly dependent on natural resources. More importantly, improvements in institutional quality could partially offset the detrimental effect of geopolitical risks on sustainable development goals. Therefore, this study provides important implications for policymakers in devising measures to maintain the progress to achieve SDGs in the era of rising global uncertainties.

VNU-University of Economics and Business 144 Xuan Thuy Street Hanoi Viet Nam       Handling editor: Lixiao Zhang This paper is likely the first attempt to empirically investigate the direct effect of geopolitical risk on sustainable development goals (SDGs). We employ a newly developed SDG index along with its 17 sub-indices from the United Nations to capture various aspects of sustainable development. On a panel sample covering 41 countries from 2015 to 2021, we find that elevated geopolitical tensions can hinder the progress towards achieving sustainable development goals. This result is robust to various model specifications and estimation approaches. Further analyses show that the two dimensions affected are Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG8) and Climate Action (SDG13). Heterogeneity test finds that the negative effect of geopolitical risks is only present in countries highly dependent on natural resources. More importantly, improvements in institutional quality could partially offset the detrimental effect of geopolitical risks on sustainable development goals. Therefore, this study provides important implications for policymakers in devising measures to maintain the progress to achieve SDGs in the era of rising global uncertainties.

However, this progress has come at a cost, including environmental degradation and climate risk (Nguyen and Su, 2021 ; Guang-Wen et al., 2022 ; Nguyen et al., 2023a ), social problems (Wan and Tian, 2022 ), cultural erosion (Nafziger and Auvinen, 2002 ), and income inequality (Taylor et al., 2016 ). As a result, the concept of sustainability has become a prominent issue on the global agenda since the 1970s (Brundtland, 1987 ). Nowadays, the concept of sustainable development is closely linked to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – a set of 17 global goals addressing key challenges such as poverty, hunger, health, education, gender equality, clean energy, climate action and sustainable cities. Despite numerous regional and international efforts, countries have shown varying degrees of performance in attaining the SDGs (Caglar and Gurler, 2022 ). Therefore, understanding determinants of sustainable development is critically important for both policymakers and researchers. While the prior literature highlights various determinants of sustainable development, including income (Koirala and Pradhan, 2019 ), inflation (Marinakis and White, 2022 ), trade openness (Xu et al., 2020 ), energy efficiency (Karintseva et al., 2021 ), technological innovation (Chien et al., 2021 ), and governance quality (Bogers et al., 2022 ), the influence of geopolitical risks on the progress towards achieving SDGs has been largely ignored. Given the lowered investment potentials and greater economic instability stemming from heightened geopolitical tensions (Syed et al., 2021 ; Caldara and Iacoviello, 2022 ; Du and Wang, 2023 ), it is feasible to expect that sustainable development could also be affected by geopolitical uncertainties. Thus, in this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap by empirically examining the influence of geopolitical risks on the progress towards achieving SDGs. Geopolitical risk refers to the risks and uncertainties arising from political, social, and economic factors at the regional or global level (Caldara and Iacoviello, 2022 ). There are a number of channels for geopolitical landscapes to influence the development progress towards achieving SDGs. On the macro level, geopolitical risks stemming from social instability and humanitarian crises often lead to displacement, poverty, inequality, and social unrest (Syed et al., 2021 ). Geopolitical conflicts could also directly or indirectly exert undesirable environmental impacts (Du and Wang, 2023 ). Next, governments in conflicted regions may prioritize short-term goals over long-term, thus disrupting policy frameworks and governance structures and hindering the implementation of sustainable development strategies (Xue et al., 2018 ). On the micro level, geopolitical conflicts could create disruptions along the global supply chains, and trade disputes may constrain countries’ access to better technologies, hamper the transfer of sustainable practices, and reduce market opportunities for sustainable products (Singh and Roca, 2022 ). Additionally, economic instability as a consequence of geopolitical events might result in an unfavourable environment for corporate investment, hence undermining investment strategies (Wang et al., 2023 ; Rumokoy et al., 2023 ). Finally, geopolitical tensions could impact international cooperation and multilateral institutions, reducing the effectiveness of global efforts to address common sustainable development challenges (Nature Editorial, 2021 ). Using fixed effects regressions on a panel data of 41 countries from 2015 to 2021, we find that elevated geopolitical tension could hinder the overall sustainable development goals. This result is robust to various model specifications and estimation approaches, including the two-step difference Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) to address potential dynamic nature and mitigate endogeneity concern in our panel data. By further examining each of the 17 individual SDGs, we find, in particular, that geopolitical risk hampers the progress towards Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG8) and Climate Action (SDG13). More importantly, we show that only countries that heavily rely on natural resources suffer from this adverse impact. Additionally, this detrimental impact of geopolitical risk on sustainable development could be partially offset by an improvement in a country's governance quality (which includes rule of law, government effectiveness, political stability and absence of violence, and control of corruption dimension). Our paper contributes to the literature in a number of ways. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that empirically examines the direct effect of geopolitical risk on the progress towards achieving the SDGs. To this end, our study combines and extends both the literature on the determinants of sustainable development (e.g., Gianella et al., 2017 ; Koirala and Pradhan, 2019 ; Karintseva et al., 2021 ; Chien et al., 2021 ; Marinakis and White, 2022 ) and the one that examines the effects of geopolitical risks (e.g., Syed et al., 2021 ; Du and Wang, 2023 ; Tang et al., 2023 ; Zhang et al., 2023 ). Second, unlike prior studies that utilize the adjusted net saving1  1 Adjusted net saving refers to the true savings rate within an economy after deducting investments made in human capital, the depletion of natural resources, and the adverse effects caused by pollution. This metric has limitations primarily stemming from measurement challenges and lack of data (Koirala and Pradhan, 2019 ).   to measure sustainable development (for instance, Hess, 2010 ; Neve and Hamaide, 2017 ; Koirala and Pradhan, 2019 ; Azam et al., 2021 ), this paper employs the sustainable development goal (SDG) index, which is constructed from 86 different indicators (Lafortune et al., 2018 ), along with 17 individual sub-indices representing various dimensions of SDGs. This is arguably the most comprehensive measure of the progress towards achieving SDGs, thus allowing us to examine the impact of geopolitical risk on every possible aspect of the SDGs’ progress. Third, we document the moderating role of institutional quality on the nexus between geopolitical risk and sustainable development goals. While the governance quality has long been shown to be associated with sustainable development (Brundtland, 1987 ), our study reveals a significant shock-absorbing role of institutional quality and sheds light on how each institutional component has importance for the impact of geopolitical risk on the achievement of SDGs. To capture the heterogeneous influence of institutional quality, we consider the following six dimensions of governance: (i) Control of corruption, (ii) Government effectiveness, (iii) Political stability and absence of violence, (iv) Rule of law, (v) Regulatory quality, and (vi) Voice and accountability. These proxies arguably represent the most comprehensive data set of institutional quality that is comparable across countries and over time (Law and Azman-Saini, 2012 ; Álvarez et al., 2018 ), and our finding can provide important implications for policymakers in devising specific measures to mitigate the negative impacts of geopolitical risks. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2  reviews the related literature and presents the hypotheses. Section 3  introduces the data and research model. Section 4  discusses the empirical results and Section 5  provides additional analyses. Finally, Section 6  concludes and provides policy implications along with directions for future research.  2 Theory and hypotheses In this section, we begin by conceptualizing and discussing some critical aspects of geopolitical risk and sustainable development goals (SDGs). This serves as a building block to adapt existing theories to formulate hypotheses regarding the potential consequences of geopolitical risk on sustainable development goals. Taking these theoretical frameworks into account, we subsequently explore (i) how geopolitical risk affects SDGs, (ii) how institutional quality moderates this relationship, and (iii) why this effect is heterogeneous depending on a country's levels of natural resource dependence. 2.1 Conceptualization of geopolitical risk and sustainable development goals 2.1.1 Geopolitical risk The term “geopolitics” denotes the study of how geography shapes political dynamics and the relationships between countries, with the focus on enduring rivalries, territorial expansion, and military strategies employed by imperial powers (Tuathail and Dalby, 2002 ). Thus, geopolitical risk encompasses the threat, realization, and escalation of adverse events related to terrorism, war, militarization, and any conflicts between countries and political entities that disrupt international relations (Caldara and Iacoviello, 2022 ). Examples of these events are the 9/11 and the Bombay attack, the US-Iraq war, the China-India, or the recent Russia – Ukraine conflicts. It is worth noting that geopolitical risk captures both the ‘risk’ and ‘uncertainty’ aspect (Caldara and Iacoviello, 2022 ; Wang et al., 2023 ; Bussy and Zheng, 2023 ). In case of risk, the probability distribution of potential outcomes is known but we do not know which specific outcome will occur. When dealing with uncertainty, both the potential outcomes and its probability distribution are unknown (Hey et al., 2010 ).2  2 In the context of geopolitical risk, for example, one could have a prior probability distribution of a war/tension breaking out (i.e. the risk aspect). Meanwhile, the potential policy responses to a conflict could have unforeseeable consequences with uncertain probabilities (i.e. the uncertainty aspect).   This subtle difference would help to explain the moderating effect of institutional quality on the relationship between geopolitical risk and sustainable development goals, which will be discussed in later section. Geopolitical risk also has other several characteristics that distinguish it from other uncertainties. First, geopolitical risk has a much broader scope, as it encompasses risks associated with international relations and security issues involving multiple countries. Dealing with geopolitical risk could be much more complicated since it necessitates collaboration and reconciliation among various parties, rather than the unilateral actions typically seen in domestic political risk scenarios. Second, the communication between the States and the public during geopolitical tensions is often vague and even contradicting (possibly due to diplomatic or national security reasons), making it more challenging for the public to understand the root causes of the tensions as well as its duration and effects. Third, geopolitical risk could escalate rapidly and unexpectedly. Finally, geopolitical risk could be long-term and persistent, as it often involves complex international issues that may take years or decades to resolve. All of these characteristics explain why geopolitical threats/events could increase the level of uncertainty in the economy, affecting the choices of all agents and exerting far-reaching impacts on sustainable development goals, which will be discussed in the later section.  2.1.2 Sustainable development goals (SDGs) Sustainable development is a prominent topic in development economics during the past several decades due to the growing concern that human economic activity has been causing significant changes to the Earth's climate, leading to large biodiversity loss and growing inequalities in consumption and welfare between advanced economies and developing and low-income countries (Robinson et al., 1992 ). Originally, sustainable development could be defined as development that meets present needs without compromising those of future generations (Brundtland, 1987 ). Further studies recognize the challenging task of achieving sustainable development due to its multi-dimensional (Nguyen and Doytch, 2022a ; Greenland et al., 2023 ) and multi-disciplinary in nature (Jabareen, 2008 ), as well as the interactions between each dimension of sustainable development. Recognizing the complexity of sustainable development, the United Nations (UN) has developed the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 to promote clear definitions and precise measures to achieve sustainable development. Unlike the previous Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were solely aimed at ending poverty, the SDGs have a broader focus, with 17 global goals, covering 5 spectrums (People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace, and Partnership). The 17 goals are (1) No Poverty; (2) Zero Hunger; (3) Good Health and Well-being; (4) Quality Education; (5) Gender Equality; (6) Clean Water and Sanitation; (7) Affordable and Clean Energy; (8) Decent Work and Economic Growth; (9) Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; (10) Reduced Inequality; (11) Sustainable Cities and Communities; (12) Responsible Consumption and Production; (13) Climate action; (14) Life Below Water; (15) Life on Land; (16) Peace, Justice and Strong Institution; (17) Partnership. Of which, the first SDG goals cover the People spectrum, emphasizing the importance of livelihood, health, well-being, and education. The Planet spectrum is expressed through goals 6, 12, 13, 14, and 15, which together represent our responses to the climate crisis via promoting sustainable consumption and environmental protection efforts. The SDG Goal 7 to 11 underscore the importance of common prosperity via economic development, innovations, as well as fairness and justice across gender, age, regions, and cultural entities. Finally, the SDG Goal 16 and 17 speak to the challenges of protecting peace and promoting partnership worldwide.   2.2 Hypothesis development 2.2.1 The impact of geopolitical risk on sustainable development goals We will now turn to a detailed discussion of how we develop our hypotheses. Since geopolitical risk encompasses both the ‘risk’ and ‘uncertainty’ aspect, the theory of decision making under risk/uncertainty could be applied to guide our hypothesis on the possible impacts of geopolitical risk on sustainable development goals (SDGs). Generally, this theory provides a framework for understanding how individuals or organizations make choices when faced with incomplete or imperfect information about the outcomes and/or the probabilities of various outcomes (Friberg, 2015 ). We will argue that both the risk and uncertainty aspect affect the choices of economic agents, thus influencing the sustainable development path of an economy. As explained in sub-section 2.1.2 , since sustainable development goals consists of multiple spectrums, it is necessary to discuss how geopolitical risk influences the five SDG spectrums as well as possible interactions between some spectrums. With regards to the Prosperity spectrum, the literature shows that geopolitical risk significantly shapes the choices of the private sector when it comes to consumption and investment (production). A surge in geopolitical tensions would likely lead to a decrease in economic growth (Soybilgen et al., 2019 ) via a reduction in corporate investment due to the widespread adoption of “wait-and-see” approach (i.e. the real option theory) (Wang et al., 2023 ; Rumokoy et al., 2023 ). It could be seen that both the risk and uncertainty aspect contribute to the decision making process of economic agents in this case. Specifically, higher risk dampens firm investment through a risk-return tradeoff (Pástor and Veronesi, 2013 ) while higher uncertainty (stems from radical regulatory shifts caused by geopolitical tensions) could lead to investment delay due to firms’ increasing concerns on unforeseen losses (Wang et al., 2023 ). Bloom (2009)  further illustrates that a pause in investment could in turn hamper productivity growth due to freezes in reallocation across unit. In a similar vein, heighten geopolitical tensions could also disrupt the global supply chains (Roscoe et al., 2022 ), hampering the natural resource production (Dogan et al., 2021 ), and eroding consumer confidence and consumption (Pehlivanoğlu et al., 2021 ). All of these effects suggest a negative impact of geopolitical risk on the Prosperity spectrum of SDGs. The potential impacts of geopolitical risk on the Planet spectrum are more complex and prior empirical studies also produce mixed findings on this issue. Therefore, we will base our hypothesis on both the theory of decision making under risk/uncertainty and theories regarding the interactions between the economy and the environment. First , geopolitical risk could dampen firms’ technological innovation via reducing their risk-taking ability because the assets that companies rely on to navigate through uncertain environments could become more vulnerable during the period of geopolitical conflicts (Habiba, 2021 ). In this context, an increase in geopolitical risk could diminish the attractiveness of renewable energy projects and hinder the seamless advancement of the energy transition (Liu et al., 2023 ), which in turn could escalate CO2 emissions and exert detrimental effects on the environment (Anser et al., 2021 ). Geopolitical risks might also shift policymakers' focus away from environmental protection policies, directing their attention towards geopolitical issues. Second , there could be a relationship between the Prosperity and Planet spectrum of SDGs. One could draw inferences from Grossman and Krueger (1991)  and argue that lower economic growth due to heightened geopolitical tensions could affect the environment via three different channels: scale  effect, composition  effect and technique  effect.3  3 The scale effect implies that economic growth negatively impacts the environment as increased production leads to more resources being exploited, which translates into more pollution and environmental degradation. Conversely, the composition effect suggests a positive impact on the environment during economic development with the transition from resource-intensive heavy manufacturing industries to service and light manufacturing industries. The technique effect indicates that economic growth promotes the replacement of dirty technologies with cleaner ones, enhancing environmental quality (Grossman and Krueger, 1991 ).   In this regard, we expect that the composition effect and technique effect outweigh the scale effect, at least for high income countries.4  4 As will be shown in sub-section 3.2  and the Appendix, most of our sample countries are high income and upper middle income.   It means that when the economic growth rate decreases, there may be a delay in the transition towards service and light manufacturing industries, as well as a slower adoption of cleaner technologies to replace outdated and polluting ones. As a result, a decline in economic growth could potentially contribute to environmental degradation, particularly in developed economies. In a similar vein, Anser et al. (2021)  propose two channels of impact between geopolitical risk and the environment: the mitigating effect and the escalating effect, and recent studies show that the escalating effect may dominate (Anser et al., 2021 ; Hashmi et al., 2022 ; Zhao et al., 2023 ).5  5 The mitigating effect suggests that GPR reduces economic growth and energy consumption, which can prevent environmental degradation. The escalating effect suggests that GPR can decrease R&D, innovations, and renewable energy, resulting in increased environmental degradation.   In light of these arguments, we expect that geopolitical risk could hamper the Planet spectrum of SDGs. The last spectrum of sustainable development relates to People, Peace, and Partnership. The People spectrum is highly related to the quality of human capital which refers to workers’ educational attainment, knowledge, skills and experience, as well as their health and welfare (Becker, 2009 ). Theoretically, there has been no conclusive agreement on how risk/uncertainty affect investment in human capital (for example, education) as this decision depends on which type of risk and uncertainty an individual may face (Bilkic et al., 2012 ). Also, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no theory that explores how geopolitical risk influence human capital accumulation. Nevertheless, empirical studies provide some insights by documenting that countries with a higher degree of instability from conflicts, civil wars, or trade disputes tend to suffer more severe poverty (Justino and Verwimp, 2013 ), and income inequality (Sweidan, 2023 ), which in turn could have adverse implications on the quality of human capital. Finally, regarding the Peace and Partnership spectrum, the nature of geopolitical risks (which focuses on conflicts between countries and political entities) implies that these spectrums could be negatively affected amid geopolitical turbulence (Gupta et al., 2019 ), especially in cases where these risks are materialized (Glick and Taylor, 2010 ). However, one may argue that geopolitical tensions between some countries may foster collaboration for some other countries since this stronger partnership may help them better navigate through the turbulence period. Overall, it is expected that geopolitical risk could negatively affect the five spectrums of SDGs, thus it leads us to the first hypothesis as follows.H1 An increase in geopolitical risk could have a negative effect on the aggregate SDGs    2.2.2 The moderating effect of institutional quality According to Hodgson (2006) , institutions could be defined as established and widely accepted sets of social rules that shape social interactions. We expect that higher levels of institutional quality could mitigate the adverse impact of geopolitical tensions on sustainable development goals because stronger institutions could greatly reduce the ‘uncertainty’ component embedded in geopolitical risk. The key premise for this hypothesis is that geopolitical conflicts are often associated with heightened policy uncertainty (Caldara and Iacoviello, 2022 ). Governments when facing geopolitical conflicts may either be under pressure to change their policies or exploit the opportunity to promote their political agendas. One example is the continuing tension between the United States (U.S.) and China starting in January 2018. This conflict was initiated when President Donald Trump of the U.S. implemented tariffs and trade restrictions on China due to the alleged persistent and unfair trade practice from China (Tankersley and Bradsher, 2018 ). In response to the trade measure from the U.S., the Chinese government alleged that the Trump administration was pursuing nationalist protectionism and subsequently enacted retaliatory measures. Clearly, in such cases, individuals or organizations not only feel the direct impact of the geopolitical event, but on the other hand are also indirectly impacted by the disruptive policy changes (and thus, the uncertainty) induced by the tension. Empirically, better institutional quality is typically associated with more predictable environment as well as more effective and consistent policymaking that is less susceptible to rapid changes even in the face of significant external shocks (Busse and Hefeker, 2007 ; Hayat, 2019 ; Nguyen et al., 2022b , 2022c , 2023b , 2023c ). Therefore, good governance can help reduce policy uncertainty arising from geopolitical conflicts. Jensen (2008)  provides similar finding that stronger institutional quality alleviates the adverse impact of political risk by reducing the likelihood of government expropriation and contractual conflicts. In cases of geopolitical turbulence, stronger governance instills more confidence in investors that these threats either will not materialize or, if they do, the government will step in to minimize their consequences. In light of these arguments, the second hypothesis is formed as follows.H2 An improvement in institutional quality would reduce the adverse impacts of geopolitical risks on the aggregate SDGs    2.2.3 The heterogeneous effect of geopolitical risk In this sub-section, we conjecture that geopolitical risks would have heterogeneous effects on the aggregate SDGs depending on a country's level of natural resource dependence. We will argue that due to the inherent political, social, and economic instability typically seen in resource-dependent countries, a surge in geopolitical risk would further amplify the uncertainty level in the economy, which translate to stronger impact of geopolitical risk on SDGs. Prior literature shows that the nexus between resource dependence and sustainable development is complex and multi-faceted. On the one hand, natural resources are essential for economic development, providing the raw materials and energy needed to support industrial production, trade, and infrastructure development (Sachs and Warner, 1997 ). On the other hand, resource dependence also creates a number of challenges for sustainable development. For one, the resource curse theory states that resource-rich countries tend to have lower economic growth than resource-poor ones (Sachs and Warner, 2001 ).6  6 Recent literature also explores the implications of natural resource abundance on social and environmental dimensions, such as human welfare (Bulte et al., 2005 ), inequality, ecological quality (Sovacool et al., 2016 ; Erdoğan et al., 2021 ).   The Dutch disease model explains that this phenomenon may be due to resource-rich countries diverting its resource away from the manufacturing sector - which is assumed to be the main engine of long term economic growth (Torvik, 2001 ). An alternative explanation is derived from the rent-seeking model, which argues that since resource rents are easily appropriable, it could lead to public policy distortions (Torvik, 2002 ). Finally, the rentier-state model shows that resource-dependent countries might be tempted to use its resource rent ineffectively (Atkinson and Hamilton, 2003 ), which in turn could delay the shift towards competitive industrialization and economic diversification. This effect could be more pronounced in the presence of adverse external shocks (Papyrakis and Gerlagh, 2004 ; Mehlum et al., 2006 ; Carbonnier et al., 2011 ) such as amid geopolitical conflicts. For example, Carbonnier et al. (2011)  find that during armed conflicts/violence, the benefit gained from resources extraction are squandered in patronage politics and political repression instead of investing in infrastructure, healthcare, and education. Furthermore, according to the Natural Resource Government Institute (NRGI), countries abundant in natural resources are more susceptible to authoritarianism and economic instability (Reader, 2015 ). In this context, a surge in geopolitical risk could further raise the level of uncertainty component embedded in geopolitical tension, thus leading to amplified impacts on SDGs. Therefore, the third hypothesis is formed as follows.H3 Geopolitical risk has heterogeneous effects on the aggregate SDGs depending on the abundance of natural resources in each country      3 Model specifications and data 3.1 Model specifications This study aims to examine the impact of geopolitical risk on the sustainable development, this paper adopts two-way fixed effect model, presented as follows:(1) S D G  i t   = β 0  + β 1  G P R  i t − 1   + β 2  Z i t − 1   + μ i  + γ t  + ε i t       where the explained variable represents the sustainable development of country i    in year t   , β 0     is the intercept term. The core explanatory variable G P R  i t      stands for the annual geopolitical risk index of country i    in year t   . The sign of β 1     is expected to be negative since our main hypothesis is that geopolitical risk could hamper sustainable development. Following the literature, we also include a number of country-specific characteristics (represented by Z i t − 1     ) that could affect a country's sustainable development progress. These control variables are real GDP per capita (LNGDPCAP), population growth (GPOP); urbanization (URBAN), trade openness (TRADE), government expenditure (GOVEX), and Domestic investment (INVEST). Prior studies show that these variables could have significant impacts on SDGs. For example, a rapid population growth could pose a threat to the sustainable utilization of natural resources (Maja and Ayano, 2021 ) and reduce universal access to education and healthcare (Das Gupta et al., 2011 ). An increase in international trade could reduce poverty (SDGs goal 1), and improve a country's productivity and general well-being (SDGs goal 3) (Sudsawasd et al., 2019 ). Government expenditures could also improve health-related SDGs (Goal 3) via increasing investment in a universal healthcare system (Osuji and Nwani, 2020 ; Guerrero and Castañeda, 2022 ). Urbanization opens avenues for sustainable urban planning, including the establishment of eco-friendly public transportation networks, green areas, and sustainable infrastructure (Pradhan et al., 2021 ) Additionally, we incorporate three other control variables to check the robustness of our results. These variables are: (i) Inflation (INFLATION), which is measured by the annual changes in the consumer price index; (ii) Natural resource rents (NATRENT), which reflects the proportion of natural resource earnings to GDP, (iii) Financial development (FD), which measures the overall development level of a country's financial market. The main independent variable, GPR, is lagged one year since we do not expect that any changes in geopolitical tensions would have immediate impacts on sustainable development goals. All control variables are also lagged one year to deal with endogeneity issue in the form of reverse causality. β 2     is a k x 1    parameter vector representing the coefficients of control variables where k    is the number of control variables. μ i     is the individual country-fixed effect controlling for the unobserved time-invariant factors and γ t     is the time-fixed effect, which controls for the unobserved common time-varying factors affecting the sustainable development of all countries in our sample, ε i t      represents the random residual term.  3.2 Data and sample overview In this study, we collected data from several sources. First, to assess the progress towards sustainable development goals, we employ the SDG index from the Sustainable Development Report. This index was established by the Bertelsmann Stiftung foundation and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (United Nations) since 2015. This composite index is an equal-weighted average of 17 sub-indices representing 17 SDG goals which are explained in sub-section 2.1 . The sub-indice for each goal is constructed from several indicators proposed by the UN Statistical Commission. The score for each goal is obtained after normalizing (on a scale of 0–100) and averaging these indicators. Finally, the overall SDG index was derived by taking the weighted average of all SDG goal scores, with the weighting based on a survey of experts and stakeholders from around the world and takes into account the interdependence and complexity of the SDGs. It should be noted that the overall SDG and its sub-index scores could be interpreted as measures of completion progresses towards achieving sustainable development, with a score of 100 indicates 100% completion. With regard to geopolitical risk, the study employs the monthly geopolitical risk (GPR) index published by Caldara and Iacoviello (2022) . The GPR index is available for 43 countries and it refers to the risk associated with wars, terrorist acts, and tensions between states that can disrupt normal international relations. The index is based on the number of articles related to adverse geopolitical events in 11 selected English-language newspapers7  7 These newspapers are The Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune, The Daily Telegraph, Financial Times, The Globe and Mail, The Guardian, Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, The Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post.   with high circulation and normalizing the count to an average value of 100. Caldara and Iacoviello (2022)  argue that their GPR index has several advantages over other available indices that suffer from some inherent shortcomings. First, it is much wider in scope as it encompasses both materialized risks and anticipated risks linked to an upward surge of geopolitical events including wars, major economic crises, political conflicts and even climate change (Bouoiyour et al., 2019 ). Second, the GPR index is more objective since it measures real-time geopolitical risk perceived by global investors, policymakers, the media, and public opinion, and therefore it could be considered as a metric reflecting current and updated media-based public opinion analysis on the threat of geopolitical risk.8  8 As a comparison, Caldara and Iacoviello (2022)  show that the US external conflict rating constructed by the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) is predominantly based on subjective assessments, drawing on the perspectives of analysts who track the developments within a specific country or region. Moreover, it has much less variations compared to the GPR index as it only changes once a year on average.   Third, the GPR index is more "exogenous" to economic conditions, meaning that it is less influenced by economic factors than other uncertainty measures. Since this study applies the annual frequency and the data is available on a monthly basis, following the literature (Dogan et al., 2021 ), we obtain the annual index by taking the average of monthly data over 12 months. Finally, we collect data on macroeconomic variables from the World Development Indicators (WDI) database (World Bank). Integrating data from these three sources generates a final sample of 287 country-year observations, including 41 countries over the period from 2015 to 2021. Table 1   illustrates the variables, explanation for each variable and the data source for each of them. Overall, our final sample has a total of 41 countries, of which 23 are high income, 12 are upper middle income, and 6 are low middle income.9  9 The full list of sample countries is presented in the Appendix.   Given that our sample is a balanced macro panel data with the number of periods (T) is much smaller relative to the number of panels (N) (T = 7, N = 41), we utilize two-way fixed effect (with country and year FEs) regression method to estimate model (1). The suitability of fixed-effect over random-effect regressions is supported via the robust Hausmann test. Additionally, we employ clustered-robust standard errors (at country level) in all regressions to account for heteroscedasticity and within-cluster serial correlations (Petersen, 2009 ).10  10 We also perform Pesaran (2021) cross-sectional dependence test on residuals of all regressions in this paper and find that the errors are not cross-sectional dependent. This results support the use of fixed-effect regression models since any common shocks on countries in our sample are absorbed via country and year FEs.    3.3 Summary statistics Table 2   presents the descriptive statistics of the main variables employed in our analysis. It can be seen that the SDG index has an average value of around 74 and a standard deviation of 6.57, indicating that there are moderate variations in SDG performance across countries in our sample. The values of geopolitical risks are more dispersed, as evidenced by its mean value of about 0.24 and standard deviation of approximately 0.4. In our sample, geopolitical risks reach the highest value of 2.628 in 2017 due to the United States (U.S) showing less inclination to take up leadership roles at that time, while Russia and China are trying to establish themselves as alternative leaders to the U.S. Regarding control variables, the mean values for logarithmic GDP per capita and population growth rate are around 9.7 and 0.7%, respectively. In addition, the economies in our sample are highly open as the level of trade openness, measured by the sum of exports and imports to GDP, has an average value of around 73%. Domestic investment accounts for 22.5% of a country's GDP, while that number for government expenditure is 18.3%, on average. The level of urbanization in our sample is quite high since slightly more than three quarters of a country's population lives in urban areas, on average. Table 3   shows the correlation matrix of the key variables in our analysis. The SDG index has a positive correlation with geopolitical risk, GDP per capita, trade openness, government expenditure, and urbanization. However, it has a negative correlation with population growth and domestic investment. Overall, the correlation coefficients between all the variables are relatively low, with the highest being 0.776 between SDG index and GDP per capita. We also use the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to check for potential multicollinearity issue and find that the VIF values for all the variables are less than 3, indicating that multicollinearity is not a concern for our empirical model (Thompson et al., 2017 ).   4 Empirical results 4.1 Baseline results Table 4   presents the results of the baseline model to examine the effects of geopolitical risk on the aggregate sustainable development goals. In this table, column (1) reports the results of the model using country fixed effects, while column (2) reports the results of the model using both country and year fixed effects. It can be seen from Table 4  that geopolitical risks appear to be negatively associated with the overall SDGs as the coefficients of GPR are negative and statistically significant when controlling for only country fixed effects or for both country and year fixed effects. This implies that the negative impact of geopolitical risks on SDGs is consistent after controlling for the unobserved time-invariant differences across countries and any time-specific shocks that affect all countries. A one standard deviation increase in geopolitical risks (0.398) in a country could lead the aggregate SDGs level to decrease by 0.204 unit point next year. This effect may seem small, but it could still be economically significant given that this is the impact of GPR on the overall SDGs index (which consists of 17 sub-indices), and even minor differences in the aggregate score could lead to changes in country rankings (Lafortune et al., 2018 ). This finding aligns with previous studies which demonstrate the adverse impact of geopolitical risks on various factors impeding sustainable development such as inflation, economic activity, public debt, and international trade (Gupta et al., 2019 ; Xu et al., 2020 ; Caldara et al., 2023 ). Overall, this finding suggests that Hypothesis 1  is valid. Our finding implies that higher risk/uncertainty levels induced by a surge in geopolitical risk may affect behaviors of economic agents in a way that is detrimental to the sustainable development path of an economy. Regarding the coefficients of control variables, it can be observed that the coefficients of economic growth measured as GDP growth per capita and urbanization factors are significantly positive in both of the columns, indicating that a country with higher economic growth and urbanization tends to have greater sustainable development. Economic growth could bring about opportunities for individuals and communities to access resources such as food, healthcare, education, and housing, thereby contributing to sustainable development (Koirala and Pradhan, 2019 ). Urbanization can create opportunities for sustainable urban planning, such as the development of public transportation systems, green spaces, and sustainable infrastructure (Pradhan et al., 2021 ), which can contribute to sustainable development by promoting resource efficiency (Wang et al., 2019 ), reducing pollution (Liang and Yang, 2019 ), thus improving quality of life.  4.2 The moderation effects of institutional quality So far, we have documented that geopolitical risks could shape the sustainable development path of a country. We now move on to examine whether this detrimental impacts of GPR could be moderated by the level of institutional quality in an economy. As indicated in Hypothesis 2 , we expect that an improvement in institutional quality could partly offset the negative effects of GPR shocks on SDGs. To test this hypothesis, we run the modified regression model, as follows:(2) S D  i t   = α 0  + α 1  G P R  i t − 1   + α 2  G P R  i t − 1   × I N S T  i t − 1   + α 3  I N S T  i t − 1   + α 4  Z i t − 1   + μ i  + γ t  + ε i t        Overall, the regr ession model (2) is similar to equation (1), except that we incorporate institutional quality measures (I N S T  i t − 1     ) as well as its interaction with geopolitical risks (G P R  i t − 1   × I N S T  i t − 1     ). This model also employs the same set of control variables as already described in Section 3.1, and it is estimated via fixed effect regressions with clustered-robust standard errors at country level to account for heteroscedasticity and within-cluster serial correlation (Petersen, 2009 ). Finally, α 2     is the coefficient of interest and it is expected to be positive. In this model, the level of institutional quality in a given country is measured by six indicators that capture six dimensions of governance, namely: (i) Control of corruption, (ii) Government effectiveness, (iii) Political stability and absence of violence, (iv) Rule of law, (v) Regulatory quality, and (vi) Voice and accountability. According to Kaufmann et al. (2011) , the control of corruption index (CC) reflects the effectiveness of anti-corruption measures, and it is constructed from various factors such as illicit payments, corruption levels in institutions and businesses, and occurrences of corruption in public organizations. The government effectiveness index (GE) gauges the quality and public satisfaction with public services, bureaucracy, infrastructure, and the trustworthiness of governments. It serves as an indicator of a government's capability to implement efficient and effective policies. The political stability and absence of violence index (PV) reflects the prevalence of politically motivated violence, terrorism, social unrest, and armed conflicts. The rule of law index (RL) encompasses public trust in the judicial system, the enforcement of contracts, protection of property rights, effectiveness of law enforcement against violent and organized crime, and the independence of the judiciary. It serves as an indicator of the overall quality and reliability of the legal framework. The regulatory quality index (RQ) evaluates the government's capacity to implement policies that facilitate the development of the private sector. It considers factors such as the government's ability to address unfair competition, the ease of starting a new business, tax efficiency, among others. Finally, the voice and accountability index (VA) measures the degree to which citizens can actively participate in selecting their government representatives and the presence of civil liberties, a free press, freedom of speech, freedom of association, and respect for human rights. All of these institutional quality indicators have values ranging from −2.5 to 2.5, with higher scores indicate higher levels of institutional quality. These six governance indicators are collected from the World Governance Indicators (WGIs), which is arguably the most comprehensive and detailed dataset of institutional quality worldwide as the latest version (2022 update) covers over 200 countries and territories from 1996 to 2021. This dataset is also widely used in the literature (Law and Azman-Saini, 2012 ; Álvarez et al., 2018 ). After integrated the institutional quality data to our sample, the final dataset has 287 country-year observations, with 41 countries over the period from 2015 to 2021. Since these six indicators are highly inter-correlated (Langbein and Knack, 2010 ), following the literature (Al-Marhubi, 2004 ; Bjørnskov, 2006 ), we also compute the aggregate institutional quality score, which is the simple average of these six dimensions.11  11 We also use the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to calculate the aggregate institutional quality index. The estimation of model (2) with this index produces consistent results with our main findings, thus it is not presented to save space.   We then incorporate this aggregate index and six sub-indices of institutional quality dimensions, along with their corresponding interaction terms with GPR into the model. The results are presented in Table 5  . Table 5  shows that the negative impacts of geopolitical risks still hold in all regression specifications. More importantly, we document that an improvement in the overall institutional quality could partially offset the adverse effects of geopolitical risks on SDGs, as evidenced by the positive and statistically significant (at 5% confidence level) coefficient of the interaction term (GPR t − 1   × INST t − 1     ). This finding could validate our argument that higher institutional quality, which is typically associated with more effective public policies and credible commitments, could reduce the uncertainty component during geopolitical turbulence. In term of economic significance, a one standard deviation (0.891) increase in the overall institutional quality would offset the negative impact of GPR on SDGs by 0.647 unit point. Further examination shows that this moderation effects of institutional quality comes from improvement in rule of law (RL), government effectiveness (GE), political stability and absence of violence (PV), and control of corruption (CC), as the coefficients of these corresponding interaction terms are all positive and statistically significant. Of which, the moderation effects of government effectiveness and political stability seem to be the largest since their coefficient estimates are nearly double those of rule of law and control of corruption. Overall, these results are consistent with Hypothesis 2 .  4.3 Heterogeneity analysis In this sub-section, we explore the heterogeneity effect of geopolitical risk by focusing on country-level characteristics. To measure the abundance of natural resources in each country, we use the natural resource rent variable (NATRENT) as it reflects how much revenue a country earns by the extraction of natural resources above the cost of extracting those resources. It is worth noting that resource-dependent countries may have very different economic, social, and political structures (Karl, 1997 ; Auty, 2001 ) that could determine how geopolitical risk and other macroeconomic variables affect SDGs. Therefore, we adopt a sub-sample analysis in this sub-section. Specifically, we divide the total sample into two equal sub-samples of low and high level of natural resource rents (based on median of NATRENT), and re-estimate equation (1)  for each group. The estimated results are presented in Table 6  . It can be seen that geopolitical risk significantly and negatively affect sustainable development for countries with high level of natural resource rents while it does not have any impact in countries that are less dependent on natural resources. Specifically, for countries that are heavily dependent on natural resources, a one standard deviation (0.398) increase in GPR would be associated with a reduction of the overall SDGs by 0.762 unit point, which is more than three times larger than the effect of GPR in the baseline regression. As explained in sub-section 2.2.3 , one possible explanation for these results is that countries that rely heavily on the extraction and export of natural resources are often more vulnerable to external shocks such as changes in global commodity prices, trade restrictions, or geopolitical instability. Therefore, a surge in geopolitical tension could further raise the level of uncertainty, which in turn could put substantial pressure on resources-dependent countries via raising economic instability and social unrest, weakening governance, reducing social spending, leading to long-term negative impacts on sustainable development (Mehlum et al., 2006 ; Carbonnier et al., 2011 ). Overall, this empirical finding is consistent with Hypothesis 3 . The results for control variables also provide some interesting insights. In particular, for countries that are more dependent on natural resources, higher levels of trade openness and government expenditures are associated with lower SDGs achievement progress. Meanwhile, these variables have positive impact on SDGs for countries with less dependent on natural resources. Overall, these findings are in line with the resource curse theory. Specifically, in resource-dependent countries, a higher degree of trade openness could lead to an overemphasis on the export of natural resources, which in turn could result to an economic imbalance where more productive sectors, such as manufacturing or agriculture, are neglected (i.e. the Dutch disease model). This can hinder SDGs as it makes the economy less diversified and more vulnerable to economic shocks. Also, the negative impact of government expenditures on SDGs in resource-rich countries could be due to the ineffective use of government funds, public policy distortions, or corruption (the rentier-state model).   5 Additional analyses 5.1 The effect of geopolitical risks on individual sustainable development goals In this sub-section, we examine the impact of geopolitical risk on each of the 17 individual sustainable development goals. We replace the overall SDG index by each of the 17 sub-indices and re-estimate equation (1)  accordingly, and the results are presented in Table 7  . Overall, the results show that geopolitical risk hampers the development of Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG8) as well as on Climate Action (SDG13), as indicated by the negative and statistically significant coefficients of GPR  in column (8) and (13). The Decent Work and Economic Growth goal is a composite index constructed from various indicators that reflect sustainable and equitable economic growth for all workers, such as the gross disposable income per capita, unemployment rate, victims of modern slavery, in work at-risk-of-poverty rate. Therefore, the finding that geopolitical risks could hinder the progress towards SDG8 is consistent with the literature, which show that elevated geopolitical risks could lead to reduced investment, trade, and economic activity (Le and Tran, 2021 ; Caldara and Iacoviello, 2022 ). The Climate Action goal (SDG13) measures each country's efforts in limiting and adapting to climate change. This is a composite index constructed from three indicators, which are CO₂ emissions embodied in fossil fuel exports, CO₂ emissions embodied in imports, and CO₂ emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production. A country with higher SDG13 score indicate that it emits less CO₂ emissions in general. Therefore, the negative impact of geopolitical risks on SDG13 means that an increase in geopolitical risks could lead to higher CO₂ emissions. This finding contributes to the heated debate on how geopolitical risks affect the environment. The literature has produced mixed findings on this issue. Anser et al. (2021)  propose two channels of impact between GPR and the environment: the "mitigating effect" and the "escalating effect." The mitigating effect suggests that GPR reduces economic growth and energy consumption, which can mitigate environmental degradation. The escalating effect suggests that GPR can decrease R&D, innovations, and renewable energy, resulting in increased environmental degradation. Ịn this respect, our paper lends support to the hypothesis that the escalating effect of geopolitical risks on the environment outweighs the mitigating effects, which translates to the positive association between GPR and CO₂ emissions.  5.2 Robustness and sensitivity checks To ensure that our main findings are robust, we also perform a battery of robustness checks, and the results are presented in Table 8  . In the first set of these tests, we add three more control variables (namely inflation rate, natural resource rents, and financial development) to the baseline model and re-estimate the regressions accordingly. These control variables are found to have an impact on the level of a country's sustainable development via adjusted net saving (Koirala and Pradhan, 2019 ). We incorporate them into the model individually to avoid multicollinearity issue. The results in the first three columns show that the estimated coefficients on GPR are negative and significant, which is consistent with our main findings. In this study, we employ the mean of monthly GPR index over a year as our main proxy for geopolitical risk. This proxy might mask the extremely high degree of geopolitical tensions in some countries during some particular months. To address this potential issue, following the literature (Baker et al., 2016 ; Anser et al., 2021 ), we sum all the monthly observations of GPR for each country-year to get the alternative measure of annual GPR (GPRSUM) and re-run our baseline regression.12  12 In another robustness check, we use yearly changes of the natural logarithm of GPR index as an alternative proxy for geopolitical risk. Our main findings still hold, the regression results are not presented to save space.   The results in column (4) show that our main findings still hold. Next, one may concern that our main results could be driven by outliers in the sample. The descriptive statistics show that there could be outliers in the geopolitical risk variable. Therefore, following the standard practice, we winsorize all of our variables at 1% level on each tail and re-estimate the baseline model accordingly. Results in column (5) show that our main findings still hold. One may also concern that our results might be confounded by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (see, among others , Elavarasan et al., 2022 ; Wang and Huang, 2021 ). In our model, the impact of COVID-19 is accounted by the use of time FEs that capture common time-varying shocks for all countries. Nevertheless, we still take one step further by excluding the COVID-19 period (2020–2021) and re-estimate the model accordingly. Column (6) shows that our main findings are still intact. In column (7), we estimate the baseline regression using the Feasible Generalized Least Squared as an alternative estimator. This method could also handle heteroscedasticity inherent in our panel data (Bai et al., 2021 ). Overall, the results are in line with our main findings. Finally, we employ the two-step difference GMM estimation proposed by Arellano and Bond (1991)  to account for possible dynamic feature in our panel data due to the persistence nature of sustainable development. One of the primary benefits of GMM is that it can deal with endogeneity issue caused by correlation between the lagged dependent variables and the individual effects by using internal instruments (Bond and Windmeijer, 2002 ). We also use robust standard errors (Windmeijer, 2005 ), small-sample adjustments, and conduct the first and second order autocorrelation tests along with the Sargan and Hansen test to examine the validity of the instrument variables (Baum et al., 2003 ). Year fixed effects are incorporated into the model to account for unobserved time-varying factors. Column (8) in Table 8  presents the results using the two-step difference GMM estimation. It is evident that the impact of geopolitical risks on sustainable development is still negative and statistically significant, which is consistent with the baseline results. The AR(2) test shows that there is no second-order serial correlation in disturbance terms. P-values from Sargan and Hansen are 0.197 and 0.121, respectively, indicating that the instruments are valid. Overall, the GMM model is robust and the coefficients of the variables of interest do not change materially.   6 Conclusion and policy implications This paper is likely the first to analyze the direct impact of geopolitical risk on various aspects of sustainable development. Unlike prior studies related to this issue, the newly developed sustainable development index and its 17 sub-indices employed in this study allow us to conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis on whether and to what extent geopolitical tensions could affect different dimensions of sustainable development. Specifically, using fixed-effect regressions on a panel data of 41 countries from 2015 to 2021, we document that an increase in geopolitical risks could impede progress towards achieving the overall sustainable development. This finding is robust to various model specification and estimation techniques, including when we use the two-step difference GMM to possible dynamic nature in our panel data. We also analyze the influence of geopolitical risk on each of the 17 individual Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and find evidence for the negative impacts on the development of Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG8) as well as Climate Action (SDG13). Interestingly, we find that only countries highly dependent on natural resources suffer from this detrimental effect of geopolitical risk. Moreover, improvement in institutional quality (rule of law, government effectiveness, political stability and absence of violence, and control of corruption) could partially offset the adverse effect of geopolitical risk. This study provides some important implications for policy makers in counteracting the negative effect of geopolitical tensions on sustainable development. First, reducing a country's dependence on its natural resources can be a viable policy response to mitigate the negative impacts of geopolitical risks. They could achieve this by shifting towards more sustainable and environmentally-friendly economic activities, such as renewable energy, technological innovations, and service sectors, which could promote long-term sustainable development. Another approach that policy makers could employ is to maintain and improve institutional quality (such as maintaining political stability along with law and order in the society, implementing robust anti-corruption measures, improving the effectiveness of public policy implementation and the quality of public services). Strengthening institutions allows countries improve investor confidence, attracting investments, therefore better withstand the challenges posed by geopolitical risks, paving the way for sustainable and inclusive economic development. This policy recommendation is particularly relevant for countries with currently low governance quality in our sample such as Venezuela, Argentina, etc. Some limitations however should be noted. First, due to data availability regarding our two main variables of interest (i.e. geopolitical risk and sustainable development goals), our study sample only includes 41 countries and covers the period starting from 2015. Second, the empirical analyses assume that individual countries have the same sustainable development path, which may not be the case for countries with extremely high geopolitical tensions. Nonetheless, our study opens several directions for future studies. Future research could employ other econometric techniques (such as ARDL) when more SDG data are available, or they could focus on regions that experience dramatically geopolitical events (for example, the Middle East). Another direction is to disentangle the impacts of individual categories of geopolitical events such as wars and conflicts, terrorist attacks and international tensions. In addition, the examination of the influence of spatial proximity on the nexus between geopolitical risk and SDGs could be another promising venue for future studies.
