               Climate change has mounted to the forefront of the world's most critical environmental issues. The countries of every continent are currently affected by climate change. It is hurting lives and destabilizing national economies, costing people, towns, and governments a lot of money today and even more in future. Climate change mitigation entails taking steps to reduce global warming and its consequences. This entails lowering human greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as well as efforts that lower GHG concentrations in the atmosphere. Along with adaptation, it is one of the strategies to respond to climate change. The importance of understanding the risks and vulnerabilities associated with climate change and considerate its effect on both human and natural systems is crucial to comprehend the current climate emergency. Attempting climate change requires accomplishment across society, spanning many approaches, tools, and communities. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in areas such as energy, land use, and disaster response is an example of a tool that offers significant opportunity for climate change mitigation and adaptation. So, it is intended for a mini-review on the importance of AI in developing mitigation strategies against climate change. This book chapter consists of three parts. In the first part, the impacts on climate action will be discussed followed by the second part that gives a description of measures for familiarizing the climate change. Finally, in the third part, the implication of AI to address the climate change will be deliberated and highlighted from several research groups.

Keywords Climate change  Sustainable development goals  Greenhouse gases  Mitigation  Artificial intelligence  Machine learning   18.1 Introduction Climate change is described as a change in patterns of weather caused mostly by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human activities and natural systems. Anthropogenic activities have so far resulted in around 1.0°C of global warming above preindustrial levels and if existing emission rates continue with 1.5°C projected between 2030 and 2052. In 2018, the world had 315 natural calamities, the majority of which were caused by climate change. Storms, floods, wildfires, and droughts affected around 68.5 million people, resulting in $131.7 billion of monetary losses, with storms, floods, wildfires, and droughts accounting for roughly 93% of the total (Fawzy et al., 2020 ). Climate variation comprises of a rise in atmospheric temperature, water shortage, descending islands, intensifying of sea-level, melting of glaciers, rate of disease, escalation of mental trauma, increased illness from diarrheal disease, widespread of death, and rising of coastal water temperature linked with intensifying cholera toxicity (Halady and Rao 2010 ; Fischhoff, 1995 ). Life-threatening weather events such as droughts, heat waves, cyclones in humid regions, and floods are becoming more common and concentrated as a result of climate change. This also aggravates water management issues, dropping agricultural production and food safety, raising health hazards, detrimental infrastructure critically, and disrupting basic services, such as cleanliness, water, transport, energy, and education (Srivastav et al., 2021 ). Oceans have warmed, snow and ice levels have decreased, and enlarged the sea levels. From 1901 to 2010, as oceans extended the worldwide average sea level ascended by 19 cm. Since 1979, the Arctic's sea ice level has decreased each time. Universal release of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) has increased by almost 50% since 1990 (Environment, 2017 ). Few factors affecting climate change are briefed below. The flow chart representing the plan of this chapter is given in Fig. 18.1  .  18.2 Factors affecting the climate change 18.2.1 Sun Sun is the primary factor influencing the climate of the earth. On our planet, it is considered to be the major source of electromagnetic energy. In the higher layers of the atmosphere, the Earth gets around 1365 W m−2  of radiant energy from the Sun (Beer et al., 2000 ). Our planet's climate is shaped by a complicated web of interconnected forces, with the Sun playing the most important role (Bard and Frank, 2006 ). The Sun emits a steady stream of radiant energy (solar radiation), which is the Earth's primary cause of heat and light. Due to thermonuclear fusion reactions, the sun produces energy. Every second in the core of the sun (at about 14 million K)1038  proton–proton reactions are carried out that convert 700 million tons of hydrogen into 695 million tons of helium. Radiative energy is responsible for the remaining 5 million tons. From all areas of the spectrum electromagnetic radiation is transmitted to the earth, carrying a vast quantity of energy (Nikolov and Petrov, 2014 ).  18.2.2 Greenhouse gases The greenhouse effect is also considered to be the primary cause of climate change. Some gases present in the Earth's atmosphere act like greenhouse glass, trapping the sun's heat, and preventing it from escaping into space, resulting in global warming. Several of this GHG are occurring naturally but some of them are intensified in the atmosphere due to anthropogenic activities. CO2  is the most significant contributor to global warming. Its concentration had increased to 48% above preindustrial levels in the atmosphere by 2020. Methane (CH4 ) has higher heat-trapping ability than CO2 , but has a shorter lifespan in the atmosphere. Like CO2 , nitrous oxide (N2 O) is a long-lived GHG that accumulates in the atmosphere over a long period of time (European Commission, 2021 ). Every year, anthropological activities roughly release 30 billion tons of CO2  into the atmosphere. Since preindustrial times, atmospheric CO2  concentrations have risen by more than 40%, from around 280 parts per million (ppm) in the 18th century to 414 ppm in 2020 (Reidmiller et al., 2018 ; US EPA, 2021 ).  18.2.3 Volcanic activity Volcanoes have had a significant impact in weather change, and earlier volcanic outbursts produced massive amounts of CO2 . Foremost volcanic explosions produce ash, aerosols, and gases and ash that effect climate processes such as upper ocean fertilization, cloud formation, and solar reflectance (Robock, 2000 ). Particles (e.g., SO2 ) thrown high into the atmosphere by powerful volcanic eruptions can reflect abundant sunlight back to space to cool the planet's surface for many years. An example of these particles is cooling aerosols (Fahey et al., 2017 ). Since volcanic particles persist in the atmosphere for a lesser time than GHGs they do not cause long-term climate change. Furthermore, anthropological activities produce more than 100 times the amount of CO2  produced by volcanoes every year. Natural causes, such as volcanic activity or variations in solar radiation are assessed to have contributed less than plus or minus 0.1°C to total global warming between 1890 and 2010 (US EPA, 2021 ).  18.2.4 Variation in the Earth's path and spinning In the past, changes in the rotation axis and Earth's orbit had a substantial influence on climate. For example, the amount of summer sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere, which is disturbed by changes in the planet's orbit, appears to be the primary source of past ice ages, in which the earth has experienced shorter interglacial periods of relatively warmer temperatures as well as long periods of cold temperatures (ice ages). The average universal temperature was around –11.6°C colder than it is today during the coldest stage of the last glacial period (or ice age). The average global temperature was only –16.6°C warmer than it is today at the peak of the previous interglacial period (Fahey et al., 2017 ).  18.2.5 Particles and aerosols Though some aerosols come from natural sources such as marine plankton, volcanoes and anthropological activities such as burning of fossil fuels and biomass contribute to their discharge. Though black carbon (BC) is an aerosol or solid particle rather than a gas, it contributes to atmospheric warming. In contrast to GHGs, BC may absorb both infra-red radiation and incoming as well as reflected sunlight. When BC accumulates on ice and snow, the surface become darkened and speeds up the melting process as the absorption of sunlight increases. In 1996, India and China together emits about 40% of the total contained combustion BC emissions globally. This was the reason for the warming of the Himalayas disproportionately (Bond, 2004 ). At the same time, it raised the particulate matter (PM)-2.5 concentrations due to which the early death rate was increased. Similarly, organic carbon and sulfates also reflects sunlight and trigger cooling process. Cooling and heating aerosols can interact with clouds, disturbing reflectivity, cloud formation, precipitation rates, and dissipation. Clouds also facilitate the warming and cooling process by trapping outgoing heat and reflecting the sunlight (Kopp and Mauzerall, 2010 ).   18.3 Consequences of climate change The after effects of the climate change are noticeable and we are able to visualize its warning signs like diminishing sea ice, risky weather, stress in the ecosystem, fires and drought. Many of these repercussions will be difficult for people to accept. Some key facts are: • Anthropogenic activities are already having an impact on society, backyards, and polar regions.  • Climate change will have a wide range of effects on the biosphere, from coral bleaching to withering forests to species loss.  • Agriculture and food security are being impacted by changes in climate and precipitation patterns.  • Mountain snowpacks, fresh water sources, and hydropower, which cater millions of people, are all threatened by climate change. A changing climate poses a hazard to human infrastructure, such as the expansion of coasts, stress on the electricity grid, and shifting structures due to the melting of permafrost.  • The populations that are already susceptible to sea-level rise and food insecurity will be hit the worst. Political turmoil, refugee migration, and global economic consequences are all evident repercussions.    According to the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED), in 2018 the world experienced 315 cases of principally climate-related natural calamities. In the same year, 68.5 million of people were affected by natural tragedies such as storms, droughts, and floods accounting to 94% of those affected. In 2018, in terms of financial losses, a total of $131.7 billion was lost due to natural calamity, with droughts ($9.7 billion), wildfires ($22.8 billion), floods ($19.7 billion), and storms ($70.8 billion), accounting for almost 93% of the overall costs (Fawzy et al., 2020 ). Table 18.1   displays the adverse effects and the consequences of climate change (Rocque et al., 2021 ; Heshmati, 2020 ; Rinkesh, 2013 ).  18.4 Mitigating measures for adapting to climate change In order to meet the challenges of the existing climate change, we must emphasis on both mitigation and adaptation: Climate change mitigation is limiting the movement of heat-trapping GHGs into the atmosphere, either by minimizing the sources of these gases (such as the burning of fossil fuels for heat, electricity, or transportation) or by improving the "sinks" (such as the oceans, forests, and soil) that gather and stock these gases. Mitigation aims to avoid extensive human interference with the climate system and stabilize GHG levels in a timespan appropriate to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, confirm that food production is not jeopardized, and enable economic progress to proceed in a sustainable manner. Adaptation—living in a fluctuating climate—entails making adjustments to the current or predicted future climate. The goal is to lessen our susceptibility to climate change negative consequences (like food insecurity, more forceful life-threatening weather events, and sea-level intrusion). Climate change (and particularly drought) has had a role in the development and fall of civilizations. For the past 12,000 years, as we know, Earth's climate has been largely stable, which has been critical for the growth of our modern civilization and life. The constant climate to which we have become used has shaped modern life (NASA, 2019 ). The sustainable development goals (SDGs), also identified as the Global Goals, are a collection of ideas set forth in a global contract to safeguard the environment, eradicate poverty and ensure that all people live in prosperity and peace today and in the future. The goals were formally accepted by all United Nations member states in 2015 for the period 2016–2030, in response to irresistible, realistic, and scientific evidence that the world need a significantly more sustainable method (Morton et al., 2017 ). There are 17 SDGs, extending from ``nonviolent societies to creative service,'' ``governance to green energy,'' ``every person's well-being to the health of the planet,'' ``infrastructure to institutions.'' Each one has a set of targets linked with it (Jones et al., 2017 ). The year 2015 marked a new development in the field of research related to climate change, when the United Nations acknowledged 17 SDGs, of which 13th goal is “Urgent action to battle climate change and its effects” (Uddin et al., 2019 ). The Paris Agreement on GHG emission adaptation, financing and reduction was signed in 2015, with specific goals to keep global average temperature rise below 2°C above preindustrial levels and then continue efforts to keep global temperature rise below 1.5°C above preindustrial levels, with the understanding that this will suggestively reduce climate change risks and impacts (Rogelj et al., 2016 ). It is well recognized that the Earth's climate has the ability to impact world history. It has the ability to change the planet's cultural, geographical, and biological foundations. However, throughout the last century, it has become clear that human activities may significantly influence the climate. Climate change has resulted from a rise of around 0.7°C in global average surface temperature during the last 100 years. Unlike past development agendas that focused solely on economic growth, the SDGs are a broad framework that encompasses a wide range of potentially conflicting policy goals in the social, environmental, and economic realms, with certain goals deemed to be equally beneficial. The success of the agenda hinges on our ability to maximize these synergies while also resolving the existing trade-offs (Kroll et al., 2019 ). This type of establishing principle allows for a wide-ranging, interdisciplinary approach to the intricate examination of traditional disciplinary sciences. New sorts of techniques necessitate far more complex models and analyses, as well as several orders of magnitude more data, resulting in the emergence of big data as a separate scientific subject. Al ready big data-based techniques are widely used in this emerging complicated science to track seasonal fluctuations in climate change (Manogaran and Lopez, 2018 ). Nowadays, it is apparent that data science and sustainability science are entangled. The complexity of the problem repository has expanded even further with the backing of the circular economy business model, demanding the inclusion of data and analytical methodologies in the context, where research outcomes from diverse domains can be used in other fields (Jabbour et al., 2019 ). Mitigating strategies, with a particular emphasis on carbon sequestration and the clean development mechanism has been reviewed. The reputation of synergy between mitigation and adaptation to climate change has been deliberated. An outline of the economy's link with emissions, including carbon tax and emission trading, as well as policies, is also provided (VijayaVenkataRaman et al., 2012 ). The resolution of operational numerical weather prediction models has improved dramatically in recent years. Simultaneously, the quality and quantity of the number of observational systems have increased and new systems are being developed (e.g., GOES-R, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R series). This GOES-R satellite series produce high-quality data. Computational sustainability is a new and quickly expanding interdisciplinary study field that focuses on computational solutions for Earth's sustainability issues (McGovern et al., 2017 ). AI has the potential to achieve 128 targets (76%) across all SDGs, mostly through technological advancements that allow us to transcend current restrictions. However, the SDGs may have a negative impact on 58 targets (34% across all SDGs) (Vinuesa et al., 2020 ). In circumstances where policy-related data is not readily available, artificial intelligence (AI) can aid in the extraction of estimates by evaluating vast amounts of raw data such as geographical imagery, sensor data or text documents. AI may be used to detect sources of GHG emissions, collect data on building efficiency characteristics and trail desertification using satellite photography (Kaack et al., 2020 ). According to the United Nations, by 2050, 74% of Europeans and 68% of the world's population will be residing in cities (Kassens-Noor and Hintze, 2020 ). In view of these figures, if the climate variation triggers of the urban areas are not recognized and addressed, a huge portion of the global population, as well as biodiversity within and around urban regions, would face factual threats (Sirmacek, 2021 ). The standardized precipitation index (SPI) is one of the most extensively used tools for meteorological drought assessment (Mckee et al., 1993 ). This approach can calculate the precipitation shortage over numerous time scales, representing the influence of lack of precipitation on the accessibility of diverse water sources. The SPI's adaptability allows it to monitor both short-term water supplies, such as soil moisture, which is perilous for agricultural productivity and long-term water resources, such as steam flow, reservoir levels, and ground water supplies. Climate change is recognized as a worldwide phenomenon that affects society on a variety of scales, from people to communities to whole regions. Global actors at various levels require both a technique and a technology to aid them in their decision-making process in order to successfully respond to climate change. Within a human development approach to climate change, the technique would be able to construct a framework to effectively coordinate activities and define priorities. The tool, on the other hand, will enable global actors to determine whether adaptation or mitigation, or both, is required to best cope with climatic variability.  18.5 Advantages of using artificial intelligence to develop mitigation strategies against climate change There are various techniques that can be implemented to mitigate climate change. But as the world becomes more technologically driven and given that most technologies operate on fossil fuels there is a need for a more advanced tool that can equip us to better fight and mitigate climate change. This tool is AI (Karyono, 2015 ). AI has made waves in many sectors including medicine, business, and economics and is currently being used to solve some of the most complex problems in the world. AI is the ability of computers to perform intelligent tasks. ML is a subset of AI wherein systems learn to do tasks based on data without being programmed to perform them. Deep learning is subset of machine learning which rely on large datasets and encompasses algorithms such as deep neural networks, long short-term memory, convolutional neural networks, etc. Reinforcement learning is another subset of ML which works based on a hit-or-miss system and uses policies to maximize the reward for the agent (Campesato, 2020 ). Since data are of prime importance when it comes to ML it can be classified into supervised, semisupervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning based on the training data. Supervised learning deals with labeled datasets, semisupervised consists of a small set of labeled data while the rest are unlabeled, Unsupervised uses datasets that consist of only unlabeled data, and finally reinforcement learning uses feedback system as training data (Zhang, 2020 ). Fig 18.2   displays all the algorithms used for mitigation of climate change in the literature review. The role of AI in mitigating climate change can be broadly classified into the following three categories: • Information collection and monitoring.  • Forecasting.  • Advancement in research and experimentation.    18.5.1 Information collection and monitoring ML can be used to gather relevant information that can help to tackle the climate change issue. Remote sensing technology which makes use of ML algorithms is used to gather information for climate change research, to forecast extreme weather conditions or for finding useful patterns in large datasets and accordingly providing estimates of the analyzed information (Brovelli et al., 2020 ). For example, it can be employed on satellite images to pinpoint various sources of GHG emissions and deforestation (Donti, 2020 ).  18.5.2 Forecasting ML can be used along with sensors and physical models to forecast climate change induced natural disasters. This prediction can be used to inform and evacuate the endangered public and prevent imminent danger. It can also be useful in forecasting solar and wind power production. Since the production of power is highly dependent on whether, it can help grid operators prepare in advance for any drastic changes in weather conditions (Donti, 2020 ).  18.5.3 Advancement in research and experimentation Scientific experimentation is a long and slow process wherein depending on the outcome various parameters of the experiment need to be fine-tuned or different combinations of variables need to be used until the required optimal result is obtained. ML can help with analyzing many experiments and suggesting ways to improve the experimentation results. This can be used for designing efficient batteries, better CO2  sorbents, etc. (Donti, 2020 ).   18.6 Artificial intelligence-centered approach for climate change mitigation The consequences of climate change threaten the normal functioning of societies by altering weather patterns, increasing emission of GHGs, etc. AI has the potential to accelerate the tasks involved in the process of mitigation of climate change such as forecasting, monitoring, decision making, collection of data, computation, and much more. AI provides a better understanding of the reality and advancement of global warming on various geographical locations by data collection using remote sensing and modeling (Ecological Processes, 2019 ). AI can be applied to various domains with respect to climate change. In this chapter, four main domains have been explored, as depicted in Fig. 18.3  . There is a high probability that there will be an increase in the number of ML-based solutions could be used to mitigate climate change challenges in the coming years. This is mainly due to the emergence of big data which enables detailed studies to be conducted. Now more than ever big corporations like Google are applying ML expertise with respect to climate change issues (Milojevic-Dupont and Creutzig, 2021 ). An overview of the ML algorithms used for mitigation of climate change is given in Table 18.2 .  18.6.1 Greenhouse gases emissions The emission of GHGs plays a key role in climate change. GHGs mainly comprises of CH4 , CO2 , N2 O, and fluorinated gases. These gases are responsible for trapping the solar radiation and warming the surface of the planet. The natural sources of GHG emissions account for majority of the emissions. But due to increased anthropogenic activities within the last 150 years, the emission of GHGs has increased significantly. Due to this it is important to monitor and predict the natural GHG emission sources as they may enter negative or positive feedback loops which can drastically affect climate change (Flaspohler et al., 2019 ). To monitor and gather information about GHG emissions, the proposed framework by Flaspohler et al. (2019)  combines classical methods of computation and machine learning to create gas emission models that can be integrated with uncertainty modeling and decision making to collect accurate and valuable data about natural GHG emission. The framework for monitoring consists of two parts. The first part makes use of principles in physics for modeling and uses gas diffusions models to maximize data rich collection paths. The second part employs. Neural network within Bayesian framework to reduce noise and increase flexibility. Neural networks are an algorithm that mimics the brain that is it consists of interconnected neurons that recognize hidden patterns from input data and classify them. These two parts reinforce one another in a feedback loop, that is the models created initially can help identify locations for collection of emission data and machine learning approach can be used to further optimize the model. Finally, with the help of reinforcement learning, a robotic agent is employed to gather information in uncertain or incorrectly modeled locations. This framework will help produce the much-needed datasets of in situ quantification of GHG emissions. Another study aimed to find a cause-and-effect link between municipal solid waste generation, GHG emissions and GDP from the year 1990–2017 in Switzerland. It made use of time series tests such as Granger causality tests, Toda-Yamamoto causality tests and D2C machine learning algorithm to determine the factors of production of municipal solid waste. First the time series approach is used to predict a causal link. Time series approach is the analysis of sequential data points over a period. But time-series analysis is not enough, as a matter of fact a new process that requires training data is begun and if the outcome is not consistent with expected result the D2C algorithm is employed (Magazzino et al., 2020 ). The D2C algorithm predicts the presence of causality among variables in a multidimensional setting. It not only predicts a correlation between two or more variables but also generates data pertaining to the causal relationship. Finally, the Sunburst ML test is used to validate the algorithm and the outcome is analyzed through a Tree model. The result obtained corroborated a bidirectional correlation between per capita GDP and production of municipal solid waste. It also confirmed that GHG emissions are caused by municipal waste production and practices such as recycling, and composting can help decrease the emissions of these potent gases (Magazzino et al., 2020 ). Forecasting of GHG emissions can also be achieved according to the study carried out by Hamrani and co-workers (Hamrani et al., 2020 ). In this study, ML was utilized to forecast GHG emissions from agricultural soils. Agricultural soils can act as transmitters or sinkholes of GHGs. The changes in CO2  and N2 O as well as many other data were calculated over a span of five years in Quebec, Canada. It further compares the performance of nine ML models in predicting GHG emissions, out of which the Long short-term memory model achieved the best results with highest regression coefficient and lowers Root Mean Squared Error. The LSTM model is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that takes time series data as input. It overcomes the limitations of RNNs and consists of one input and output layer and multiple hidden layers. Various input parameters such as soil and air temperature, humidity, precipitation, speed of wind, surface pressure, and volume of water content in soils were considered out of which soil and air temperatures produced highest correlation with respect to the emission of GHGs in agricultural fields. Other models that were considered in this comparative study is support vector machines, random forest, least absolute shrinkage, and selection operator regression, feedforward neural network, radial basis function neural networks, enhanced explainable neural networks, deep belief network, and convolutional neural networks. Long short-term memory achieved better results as this model can store past information which is beneficial to predict future data based on the previously encountered datasets.  18.6.2 Farms and forestry Autotrophic organisms have been using up CO2  for decades. The majority of this CO2  follows the carbon cycle and some are stored in natural reserves such as coal and oil, but a good amount of carbon is sequestered in soils, bogs, biomass, and peat. By continuing practices of deforestation and improper agricultural practices these sources of sequestered carbon are released into the atmosphere thus becoming a detriment in climate change. Apart from this livestock and rice farming leads to the release of an even more potent CH4  gas which again contributes to climate change. As a consequence of climate change, in polar regions the ice present inside permafrost melts causing destruction of various infrastructure, there is an increased occurrence of forest fires, peat bogs are drying, etc. (Rolnick et al., 2019 ). To combat this various AI solutions have been proposed. According to a study (Brovelli et al., 2020 ), AI can be used to combat deforestation by means of monitoring and modeling. The study aims to map and monitor variations in the Amazon Forest cover from the year 2000–2019 and simulate future forest growth for the years 2019–2028 by using remote sensing technology and ML on a cloud processing platform. The dataset used were multispectral images of missions Landsat 5, 7, 8, and Sentinel-2. The validation was performed using China–Brazil Earth Resource Satellite dataset which consisted of high-resolution panchromatic images. In this study, random forest which is a supervised ML classifier algorithm was used. It is an ensemble model that is it consists of smaller decision trees. Random forest combines outcomes of these decision trees to produce an accurate result. It was used to classify the landcover as either regions of forest or nonforest. This algorithm is an ensemble of multiple decision trees. This algorithm was chosen due to its extensive discussion in academic research as well as due to its high accuracy and its ability to consider noise and outliers. It was later deployed on the cloud processing platform Google Earth Engine, which is used mainly due to its vast collection of satellite databases and computation abilities. The simulation of forest cover was done using previously obtained past and present maps. For the simulation a plugin Modules for Land Use Chang Evaluation (MOLUSCE) in QGIS which is an open-source Geographic Information System platform was used. This platform is used for storing, managing, analyzing, and visualizing geographical data. It is used to integrate already established models and analyze the model's potential land usage as well as forest transitions. The main module transition potential modeling uses probabilities and artificial neural network (ANN) to compute future transition maps and cellular automata simulation based on Monte Carlo was used to generate simulated landcover maps. The results after mapping and modeling showed a peak in the rate of deforestation from the years 2000–2006, decrease for the period of 2006–2015 followed by a marginal increase till 2019. Based on the extracted pattern the simulation of future forest cover predicted a decrease in deforestation rates for the period of 2019 to 2028. Thus, the combination of time-series investigation along with simulation of future forest variation can be of great value to policy makers who can help create and implement policies to protect and preserve forest cover (Brovelli et al., 2020 ). Precision agriculture is the science of improving agronomics with the help of advanced technologies such as sensors and other investigation tools. This can help reduce carbon emissions from the soil and aid in the generation of better crop yield which could in turn decrease the rate of deforestation (Rolnick et al., 2019 ). Machine learning algorithms can be used in precision agriculture to recognize trends in large datasets which can consequently help predict future results. Neural networks are the most commonly used algorithm for forecasting. It is trained on a large dataset which determines its predictive capabilities. Bayesian networks are another set of algorithms commonly used to integrate uncertainty modeling for decision-making systems (Zhang et al., 2021 ). Different types of ML algorithms can be used in applications of agriculture and agronomy. For example, a software tool was developed by Nemes et al. (2008)  that utilizes the k-nearest neighbors is a lazy learning supervised learning algorithm. It stores all the data points and classifies new data points based on how similar the data point is to its neighbors is used to evaluate the soil water retention at −33 and −1500 kPa matric potentials and its uncertainty. It uses two parameters one being “k” the number of nearest neighbors and “p” which is used for computing weights which are dependent on distance-weighted neighbors. After the nearest neighbors are identified they are allocated weights and the response attribute is the weighted average of the response attributes of the nearest neighbors. The tool uses texture of soil, bulk density, and organic matter content as inputs. In another study, Hamada et al. (2019)  presented a multispectral image segmentation using K-means clustering algorithm, which is an unsupervised learning algorithm. Using remote sensing technologies in depth analysis of segmentation of crops can be performed. The satellite image database used in this study is Sentinel 2. Using these multi spectral images clustering based on pixel of 12 channels is done using k-means. In the research done by Bu and Wang (2019) , a smart agriculture Internet of Things (IoT) model which uses deep reinforcement learning to make decisions was put forward. This system was used to increase yield and decrease the exhaustion of resources like water. This model mainly consists of four layers, the data accumulation layer, edge computing layer, data mediation layer, and finally cloud computing layer. The bottom layer consists of the data accumulation layer which uses sensors to collect environmental factors that determine production of crops such as moisture content in the air, temperature, moisture present in the soil, concentration of CO2,  and intensity of light. Information about these parameters is collected at an interval of 5 min. The collected information is then sent to the edge layer for preprocessing. Two preprocessing jobs are performed, the first one checks if all the sensors are working properly, which can be verified by identifying improper data. The second task is to decrease the amount of collected information that reaches the cloud layer so that the bandwidth can be saved. This is achieved by compressing the data. Finally, by using data mining algorithms and AI models the information transmitted is analyzed. Deep reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-learning and CNN are used for smart decision-making. For instance, decision like the amount of water that needs to be used to irrigate the crops, etc.  18.6.3 Climate models Climate models are representative of our comprehension of the Earth and the physics behind climate. By gathering more information, we can understand and get better insights about the earth. To further obtain value from the collected data we need to compress it into computationally manageable models to perform forecasting or identify important patterns and trends. To help with this ML techniques can be employed. It can be used in remote sensing machinery to gather and classify data. It can also be used for prediction and simulation. For instance, in the research paper presented by Lary et al. (2016) , an ensemble of RFs and remote sensing technology have been used to predict the amount of daily worldwide PM2.5 . PM2.5  refers to the airborne particulate matter with a diameter of 2.55 mm or less. Exposure to PM2.5  is strongly linked with increased respiratory issues and a rise in death rates. In another study, GIS, ML techniques, and remote sensing were utilized to find out if there was an increase in flash flood frequency across the Earth as a consequence of climate change. Therefore, correlation between usage of land and changes in flash-flood potential in Romania over the period of 1989–2019 was studied in this paper. The dataset used was Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 which consisted of geospatial data that was used in the classification process. After the data were gathered, it was then used as input in the following steps: remote sensing image processing, investigation of changes in usage of land/land-cover, evaluation of flash-flood potential, and geo-statistical examination. Multilayer perceptron is a supervised learning algorithm that consists of and input, hidden, and output layer. It is used to solve classification problems. In this scenario, it is used to prevent noise from entering the data that is used in ML models and decrease in essential data used during training phase of the model (Costache et al., 2020 ). The multilayer perceptron is a kind of neural networks which has three layers: input layer that contains interconnected neurons which represent factors of flash-flood conditioning, hidden layers that contain constraints used to train multilayer perceptron model and finally the output layer which consists of two neurons which classify the data into flash-flood locations and nonflash-flood locations. Lastly, the correlation between indicators of changes in land-use/cover and flash-flood potential was evaluated using geographically weighted regression. These results showed high correlation between changed in land-use/cover and flash-flood potential (Costache et al., 2020 ). Extreme events can be forecasted using ML models as well. The greenhouse effect which refers to an increase in the temperature of the Earth's surface leads to climate change (Najafi et al., 2015 ). Consequently, temperatures in the Arctic have risen by twofold compared to the rest of the world leading to melting of polar ice caps, which in turn leads to a rise in sea-level (Vihma, 2014 ). The Arctic sea ice is an important indicator with respect to the rate of global warming. Deep learning which is a subset of ML consists of neural networks with more than one hidden layer. These models train on large training datasets and the hidden layers therefore help optimize and increase accuracy of the model. Deep learning models such as long short term memory and multilayer perceptron are used in the study done by Chi and Kim (2017)  to predict ice concentration in the Arctic sea. The database consists of monthly sea ice concentration (SIC) data obtained from passive microwave sensors. These are commonly used due to their spread-out coverage and temporal resolution (Parkinson et al., 1996 ). Other methods used to obtain data on sea ice are remote sensing or visual observations by experts (Spreen et al., 2008 ). The results prove that DL models can be used to successfully predict monthly SICs throughout the span of a year. Although, the forecast accuracy dips in the summer season compared to the winter season due to accelerated variations in melting of sea ice. Forest fires are destructive events that take place in hot regions. These fires can cause huge amounts of damage to flora and fauna, threaten the lives of people and lead to excessive CO2  emissions which can cause headaches, nausea, or even death (Castelli et al., 2015 ). The methodology proposed by Sakr et al. (2010)  makes use of SVM algorithm to predict the severity of fire hazards on a day-to-day basis based on the previous day's weather condition. The dataset used was provided by Lebanese Agricultural Research Institute (LARI) which provided weather conditions in Lebanon over a span of 8 years, that is, from 2000 to 2008. SVM is a classifier which classifies linearly separable data into classes by making use of a linear hyperplane with maximal margin (Kecman, 2001 ). In cases where data are not linearly separable, SVM makes use of kernels such as radial basis function which is used for separation when there is no prior knowledge of the data, polynomial which is a generalized version of linear kernel or sigmoid which is mostly used in neural networks as activation function to map to a higher dimensional space. The weather data of each day from LARI corresponds to the set of fires that is taken from the fire list. These led to the creation of 4 scaled of danger where 1 represented lowest risk of fires and 4 highest risks of fires. SVM was used to classify the data into no fire day (Class 1), possibility of fires happing on that day (Class 2), 10% greater risks of fires taking place (Class 3), and Class 4 corresponds to an increased risk greater than ten percent. The architecture proposed is a 4-class classification SVM where SVM1 classifies data into 2 classes that is scales 1 and 2 are combines to form one class and class 3 and 4 another class. SVM2 uses scale 1 as class 1 and scale 2 as class 2 for training. SVM3 uses scale 3 as class 1 and scale 4 as class 2 for training. Therefore, the workflow of this model is a point that gets classified by SVM1 as class 1 will be transferred to SVM2 which will result in the corresponding scale (Sakr et al., 2010 ).  18.6.4 Cities and buildings Energy consumptions in the buildings make up a quarter of the worldwide energy-related emissions (Allen et al., 2019 ). But now more than ever it is possible for current buildings to consume close to no energy (Olsthoorn et al., 2019 ). The reduction of GHG emissions can be accelerated using ML techniques. ML can be used for modeling energy utilization data and optimization of consumption of energy (Rolnick et al., 2019 ). Modeling of energy consumption data can be done by using the data generated by meters and home energy monitors. This can then be used to predict energy demand for individual buildings which can be of use during the designing and operation phase of buildings (Amasyali and El-Gohary, 2018 ). Usually, models used for predicting energy demands are computationally expensive and based on the structure of the building. But ML can accelerate these computations either by completely disregarding the data on the structure of the building (Paterakis et al., 2017 ), by using the data in the computation (Dong et al., 2016 ) or by estimating the physical structure of the building (Van Gelder et al., 2014 ). For instance, deep learning models like long short-term memory can be used for modeling time-series events. The energy demand represents time-series nonstationary dataset. Another algorithm that was discussed for energy demand prediction was autoencoders. These are NNs that come under unsupervised learning. In this model, the hidden layers always have a smaller number of interconnected neurons compared to the input and output layers. Energy consumption can be optimized as done in the application of smart buildings. Intelligent control systems can reduce the emissions of GHGs by reducing the energy used up in buildings and by providing a way to use lower-carbon sources for the purpose of generating electricity (Gershenfeld et al., 2010 ). Critical systems and small appliances present inside buildings can be made to work in an efficient manner with the help of ML algorithms. For example, energy consumption of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system (HVAC) account for more than half of the total energy consumption of buildings (Fischedick et al., 2014 ). As a consequence of climate change the increased rise in temperatures has led to a rise in the usage of HVAC systems which in turn has resulted in a huge amount of energy wastage. For systems that are not driven by AI, energy efficiency is not an important factor considered during the manufacturing process. In nonsmart environments, it becomes the user's responsibility to observe and manage these appliances, for instance, to turn off the air conditioning system to avoid wastage of energy. But in an environment equipped with IoT, sensors, interconnected air conditioners and heaters, the temperature can be automatically adjusted using ML techniques (Alawadi et al., 2020 ). HVAC systems usually face a lot of issues due to uncertainties in measurement, noise, and temperature. Thus, the technique proposed by Gharsellaoui et al. (2020)  uses multiscale interval principal component analysis (PCA) for fault detection and diagnosis. PCA is a common feature selection and extraction technique (Ren et al., 2011 ). By using this technique, the energy use is minimized, diagnosis performance is improved and there is an increase in the quality of indoor environment as well. Hence, this technique is used in cases of uncertain HVAC systems. When considering renewable resources as a source of energy in order to make HVAC systems more energy-efficient, solar energy is at the forefront compared to other sources. It is advantageous compared to traditional sources of energy in terms of pollution, cost, and noise. But the disadvantage of using this energy is that it is only available during the day and depends on the weather as well (Reinders et al., 2017 ). There are two ways to overcome this issue, the energy must be stored for later use or it must be used in a timely manner. The option involving storage of energy is not given primary importance due to the associated cost and the impact of batteries on the environment (Peters et al., 2017 ). Therefore, KilinÇ et al. (2021)  proposed a way to overcome this drawback by using a microcontroller that relies on ANN algorithm. This device heats the environment disregarding desired temperature until a particular decision point that is when the heater turns off. The room then cools down to the desired temperature. It does not use any prior knowledge with respect to size, occupancy, etc. It is purely based on internal and external temperature.   18.7 Conclusions Various research works indicate that AI might possibly act as an enabler for a variety of SDG targets and indicators. The majority of these studies were conducted in restricted laboratory contexts, with limited datasets, or utilizing prototypes. As a result, generalizing this data to assess real-world implications is frequently difficult and continues to be a challenge. The more we enable SDGs by deploying AI applications, such as AI based health care, smart electrical grids, and autonomous vehicles the more important it becomes to invest in AI safety research to keep these systems robust and beneficial and to prevent them from malfunctioning or being hacked. Understanding catastrophes, which can be enabled by a systemic flaw in AI technology, is a critical study venue for a safe integration of AI. For example, due to the integration of AI in the financial sector, a recent World Economic Forum reported that in a society that is progressively reliant on AI, it is critical to increase awareness about the hazards connected with future AI system breakdowns. Climate change is a challenging and uncertain issue therefore AI can be used as a tool to better understand the rates of increasing global warming, emissions of GHGs, rise in sea level, etc. It can also help us to be better prepared in cases of extreme events or natural calamities. It is a tool that can be implemented with ease as compared to other real-world systems that are computationally expensive and hard to implement. With further research and advancements in this field we can be better equipped to deal with the possible consequences of climate change or at the most prepare for its outcomes. The goal was to analyze and gain knowledge on the significance of AI to develop mitigation strategies so that this compilation will furnish anyone in future for easy reference and further studies on the same in depth.
