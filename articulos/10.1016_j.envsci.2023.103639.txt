                  The United Nations’ (UNs) 2030 “Sustainable Development Goals are a universal call to action to protect the planet and improve the lives and prospects of everyone, everywhere.
                     ” This requires much effort of in governmental policies along with public and private sector practices. With regard to this, BGs have a crucial role in bringing this vision of the future. Of the 17 SDGs, Target 15—Life on land is directly associated with the traditional work of botanic gardens (BGs). But other four goals (2—Zero hunger, 4—Quality education, 11—Sustainable cities and communities, 13—Climate action) are also worthy of review and analyze when considering BGs. They could meet the needs of both the local and global communities and are effective in shaping the future and promoting the 2030 goals. In this context, paying attention to the UN's global and inclusive call, this paper focuses on Eden Project, United Kingdom, Ecorium of National Institute of Ecology, South Korea and Konya Tropical Botanical Garden, Turkey. Missions of the projects rely on conservation, restoration, education and community engagement. They address several global concerns, including climate and biodiversity emergency. Aim of this paper is to investigate to what extent the selected BGs can contribute to the SDGs. Results underline BGs as a valuable input in decision-making and policy action concerning environmental justice, equity, and inclusion that encourage transformative steps in achieving the SDGs.

Part of the EP International, the Eden Project North is set to open in Morecambe Bay and will include a place-based program of education. Besides, National Wildflower Centre established New Wildflower Habitats in urban areas of Dundee, Morecambe and Liverpool in 2022. Seven sites were seeded in Dundee, funded by the Alexander Concur Trust and NatureScot. A further eleven sites were prepared in Morecambe, funded in partnership with Playstation and Lancaster City Council. This contributes to the Target 17.3.  In the EP, visitors can enjoy many edible gardens involving olive, banana, pineapple. Additionally, they can benefit from ‘Positive Food Futures’ course that enables food activity experience with up to 10 participants. This course is effective to grow several foods (e.g. superabundance fruit, crab apple etc.). Here, horticulturists provide visitors with tips on the planting of native trees in an edible garden for visitors' own homes encouraging the Target 4.7. Besides, growing plant helps absorbing carbon from the atmosphere, which contributes global warming supporting the Target 13.1. The EP also works with the National Wildflower Centre (NWC) created new wildflower habitats in urban areas of Dundee, Morecambe and Liverpool in 2022. Seven sites were seeded in Dundee (funded by Alexander Concur Trust and NatureScot) and eleven sites were prepared in Morecambe, (funded in partnership with Play station and Lancaster City Council). The NWC founded a new seedbank to augment its conservation works and gained funding for PhD students of EP to train genetic diversity of wildflower seed stock in 2022 (Annual Report 2022; 50) which supports Target 4.7.   https://doi.org/10.15223/policy-017 https://doi.org/10.15223/policy-037 https://doi.org/10.15223/policy-012 https://doi.org/10.15223/policy-029

The United Nations’ (UNs) 2030 “Sustainable Development Goals are a universal call to action to protect the planet and improve the lives and prospects of everyone, everywhere.  ” This requires much effort of in governmental policies along with public and private sector practices. With regard to this, BGs have a crucial role in bringing this vision of the future. Of the 17 SDGs, Target 15—Life on land is directly associated with the traditional work of botanic gardens (BGs). But other four goals (2—Zero hunger, 4—Quality education, 11—Sustainable cities and communities, 13—Climate action) are also worthy of review and analyze when considering BGs. They could meet the needs of both the local and global communities and are effective in shaping the future and promoting the 2030 goals. In this context, paying attention to the UN's global and inclusive call, this paper focuses on Eden Project, United Kingdom, Ecorium of National Institute of Ecology, South Korea and Konya Tropical Botanical Garden, Turkey. Missions of the projects rely on conservation, restoration, education and community engagement. They address several global concerns, including climate and biodiversity emergency. Aim of this paper is to investigate to what extent the selected BGs can contribute to the SDGs. Results underline BGs as a valuable input in decision-making and policy action concerning environmental justice, equity, and inclusion that encourage transformative steps in achieving the SDGs.   Keywords Botanic gardens  Sustainable Development Goals  Global change  Biodiversity conservation  Environmental justice  Social justice   Data Availability Data will be made available on request.   1 Introduction Nature well-being has been recently in jeopardy requiring urgent attention (Antonelli et al., 2019 ; Liotta et al., 2020; Sharifi et al., 2021 ; Kato-Huerta and Geneletti, 2022 ). Anthropogenic impacts like global warming and biodiversity loss have recently accelerated at an unprecedented rate (Turnhout et al., 2013; Johnson et al., 2017; Blackmore and Oldfield, 2017 ) that decreased human well-being (Kuzevanov and Sizykh, 2006 ) . It is projected 40% of plant species are endangered with extinction (Antonelli et al., 2019 ). Besides, 75% of land-based environment and around 66% of marine environment have been changed by human impact (United Nations, 2022; Ichii et al., 2019 ). Future climate impact (Minx et al., 2017 ) and biodiversity emergency projections are dire (Hooper et al., 2012;  Johnson et al., 2017) . Here, botanical gardens (BGs) are at the forefront to overcome global crises by their environmental works and technical expertise. Activities in BGs fortify relation between nature and human flourishing (Pooley and O’Connor, 2000 ; Waylen, 2006; Dodd and Jones, 2010; Heywood and Jackson, 2012; Rakow and Lee, 2015 ; O’Donnell and Sharrock, 2017; Sharrock, 2018 ; Zelenika et al., 2018;  Lopez-Villalobos et al., 2022 ). [1] These activities contribute to the protection of biodiversity conservation, exhibition and restoration. Globally 2500 BGs enable nearly 6 million living plant accessions. [2] They are effective on social issues via nature education to boost pro-conservation attitudes, consciousness and experiential knowledge. [4] BGs support the exchange and coupling of traditional scientific knowledge and environmental policy. [5] They increase economic development by works on agriculture, forestry and fisheries. These contributions are crucial to support sustainable development. Blackmore states (2017, 295) ‘‘A botanic garden is an ideal place in which to learn about and reflect upon global change and to become more aware of the UN’s 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda ’’. In 2015, the United Nations (UNs) outlined 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to promote nature and human well-being. The SDGs involve 169 targets relying on economic, social, and environmental improvements globally. They are interconnected (Cowell et al., 2022 ) addressing more than only one target to activate policy integration and social inclusion among sectors (Le Blanc, 2015; Sharrock and Jackson, 2017 ). BGs are one of the sectors that the SDGs depend on (Sharrock, 2018; Alford et al., 2022 ). They have impact on the interaction between the SDGs and environmental justice.1  1 Rise of environmental justice relies on a social movement against the effect of polluting facilities in areas that concentrated ethnic minorities and economically disadvantaged communities (Schlosberg, 2013 ).   The paper aims to contribute to the literature concerning the association between the SDGs and BGs through a cross-national comparative analysis of the case studies. It selected 3 indoor garden projects ( Table 1 ), but this study addresses them as a botanic garden. The study involves eight parts. It begins with methodology of the research, involving introduction of the SDGs and the case selection process to explore how BGs can foster the SDGs. Section Three looks to literature review on BGs and their evolving role over time. Section Four focuses on the future potentials of BGs and the following section addresses relation between BGs and the SDGs. Section Six examines the Eden Project, Ecorium Project of National Institute of Ecology and Konya Tropical Butterfly Garden to follow-up the progress for fulfilling the SDGs. This section assesses the projects to what extent they can contribute to the SDGs. Section Seven discusses the findings of the case study analysis related to the SDGs. Lastly, the paper concludes with potential contribution of BGs to the SDGs and their role in the future trends regarding environmental justice and social inclusion.  2 Methodology This analysis is based on a cross-national comparative case study analysis2  2 Comparative case study methodology relies on the analysis of the similarities and differences across two or more cases that intersect at a mutual emphasis. It yields knowledge that is easier to realize on basic questions – how or why certain programmes or policies success or fail to work (Goodrick, 2014 )   with a theoretical approach to contribute to the SDGs. For this analysis, 17 SDGs and 169 Targets were analyzed to investigate the 3 projects. Specifically 5 Goals (2, 4, 11, 13 and 15) and 12 Targets (15.1, 15.2, 15.5,15.a 13.1, 13.3, 11.7, 4.5, 4.7, 4.c, 2.5, 2.1) were specified as directly linked to the projects. In addition, 5 Goals (1, 6, 8, 10, 14) and 6 Targets (1.1, 6.6, 8.6. 8.9, 10.2, 14.2) were determined as relevant. The paper depends on qualitative and quantitative data by secondary sources (e.g. projects reports, SDGs reports, annual reports of the projects, documents, websites, research articles and news articles). It is an example of both national and global commitments for the 2030 Agenda. First, the Eden Project Limited’s project is an ambitious organisation concerning environmental justice and social inclusion. It introduces itself as a ‘educational charity’ and ‘social enterprise ” addressing a range of people that comes from different background. The EP is well-known for its social responsibility in social justice (Dodd and Jones, 2010 , Mysen, 2012 ; Upton, 2020 ) along with outreach initiatives (Mysen, 2012 ) and environmental justice are also important issues (Prance, 2002; Dodd and Jones, 2010 ). Dod and Jones assert “The works of the Eden Project is valuable, if not critical, but it is not a model which should be emulated by every botanic garden ” (2010 ; 8). It aims global community development in a sustainable environment. In 2020, Chief Executive Officer described the mission of the organisation as “The Eden Project connects people with each other and the living world”.  Although, the role of the project on sustainability was discussed a lot in previously literature (Bowker, 2002; Blewitt, 2004 ; Evans and Shawn, 2004;  Dodd and Jones, 2010 ; Mysen, 2012 ), the EP was not examined concerning the selected 5 SDGs. Second, in contrast to the EP, the NIE aims national development with the local communities, as a government-affiliated institute under the Ministry of Environment. It enhances Korea’s environmental restoration works to mitigate climate change and biodiversity loss (Temperton et al., 2014 ; Yoon et. al, 2021 ; Park and Kang, 2021 ) by making national corporations (National Institute of Ecology, 2022 ). Besides, it performs environmental education to the public through expert training programs, and book publication (National Institute of Ecology, 2022 ; Kim et al., 2021 ). Therefore, the NIE is a prominent organisation to examine the 5 selected Goals. In addition, there are not any study discussing the NIE regarding the selected SDGs (in the literature in English sources). Third, similar to the NIE, KTBG is a government-affiliated institute under Selçuklu Municipality. It is one of the few butterfly gardens in the world. KTBG was shown as an exemplary project in Sustainable cities and living spaces (Goal 11, Target 11.7) (UCLG-MEWA, 2020  37). Therefore, it is a remarkable project for Turkey that is a less developed country (WorldData.info, 2023 ) but strives to promote the SDGs. In this regard, it is important that KTBG has potential for Konya province, which places at the middle of fruitful soils for agriculture. It can lead many developments regarding social, environmental, and economic issues in Konya, that is in Central Anatolia region, as a developing part of the country. This project is of significance to carry out a research, already the literature requires more English papers on KTBG. Briefly, three of the projects have potentials to spread environmental justice and social inclusion.  3 The evolving role of botanic gardens in the face of global challenges Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI, N.d. ) defines BGs as “institutions holding documented collections of living plants for the purposes of scientific research, conservation, display and education ” . They are known for their collections of species for exhibition and taxonomic research on threatened species (Maunder, 1994; Johnson, 2006; Oldfield, 2009 ). However, the role of BGs has changed during time (Willison, 1997;  Heywood, 2011 ; Krishnan, 2016 ; Mackay, 2018 ). The traditional concept of BGs at universities undergone institutional change due to technical developments, exploration and worldwide trade (Hyams, 1969; Brockway, 1979 ). European colonial expansions led economic development for Western countries (Drayton, 2000; Mackay, 2018; Neves, 2019 ). Developments in ship manufacturing, navigation, and weaponry allowed Western nations to visit all the oceans of the world and create outposts for importing their industrial goods, the products of that same technology (Brockway, 1979 ). This brough about BGs to discover new sites, such as Asia, America and Africa for cultivation and distribution of economically essential crops and spices (Hyams, 1969; Heywood, 2011; Krishnan and Novy, 2016 ). They expanded to Holland, England, France and German (Mackay, 2018 ). Expeditions paved the way for discovery of new species. For instance, the Kew Botanical Gardens began to engaged in cultivation of new crops. In this way, the global networks led the movement of people, plant, profit, power as the key elements of the botany (Johnson, 2006 ). During the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, several BGs were established in the global south as adaptational locations enabling the circulation and reproduction of plants for European economic advantage on a planetary scale. ‘‘Botanic gardens were thus embroiled in the rise of modernity as institutions of scientific engagement, the establishment of European colonialism ’’ (Neves, 2019; 3 ). From the middle of the eighteenth century onwards, transfer of crop species and plant interchange rapidly expanded species across the world (Rakow and Lee, 2015; Baber, 2016; Mackay, 2018 ). European states apart from Asian or American empires tried to the transfer of exotic species to their dominions, the French was also effective as England (Mackay, 2018 ). In this era, the wealth of colonies relied on their exotic species—spices, sugar, coffee (Brockway, 1979; Mackay, 2018 ).  4 Redefinition of the role of botanic gardens: Future trends In the 1850 s, aesthetic and scientific arrangement in planting gained significance (Johnson, 2006 ). Particularly, Western BGs were enclosed by high walls and surroundings with fanciful landscapes that do not exist together in nature (Neves, 2009 ). The formal and the picturesque garden design played a role to uncover the order of nature. Certain BGs integrated more naturalistic and aesthetic forms, such as, the Kew Botanical Gardens, UK (Johnson, 2006; Villagra-Islas, 2011 ). Plants were demonstrated by using colors, shapes, sizes and textures to attract recreational needs (Villagra-Islas, 2011 ). BGs have recently appeal to a large audience by rising as an iconic landmark. As global trends on culture change, they have started to become urban icons. Sklair (2017,16)  emphasized, “the terms ‘icon’ and ‘iconic’ are in common usage for a wide variety of cultural phenomena, and this is particularly true for architecture ”. BGs are at the forefront by symbolic and aesthetic significance. In this sense, Cosgrove and Daniels (1988,3)  argued, icons of landscape can be useful to ‘‘structure environments according to specific demands ’’. The icon strategy is seen as an instrument for BGs to create settings for economic and environmental gains (Villagra-Islas, 2011 ). As flagship attractions, BGs attract local/global tourists (Ballantyne et al., 2008 ). BGs deliver a sustainable form of tourism development (Sharpley, 2007 ). Now, they have become popular tourist attractions reaching out to large audiences. Over half a billion people visit BGs annually (Westwood et. al, 2021 ). For example, Garden by the Bay and Seoul Botanic Park have respectively reached more than “50 million visitors to date ” (Gardens by the Bay, N.d. ) and “ 10 million visitors to date”  (Korea Herald, 2021 )  Fig. 1 .a-b . In 2018, BGCI revised the definition of BGs with an emphasis on ‘‘conserving rare and threatened plants, compliance with international policies, and sustainability and ethical initiatives’’  . Now, BGs have developed into pioneer institutions in the spheres of arboriculture, horticulture, and floriculture (Hill, 1915; Krishnan and Novy, 2016 ). They globally preserve over 41% of endangered species in their collections and seed banks (Stork, 2010; Mounce et al., 2017; Heywood, 2017 ). They deal with overwhelming global obstacles, e.g. climate change, food security, biodiversity loss (Klenk and Meehan, 2015; Blackmore and Oldfield, 2017; Dunn, 2017 ; Chen and Sun, 2018; Sharrock, 2018 ). As global trends change, BGs have adopted more social roles to connect society with nature (Waylen, 2006; Shaw, 2015; Razak et al., 2016  ; Neves, 2019 ). BGs are currently effective facilities to attain sustainable development (Wyse Jackson and Sutherland, 2000; Heywood, 2011 ; Lynch, 2015;  Krishnan and Novy, 2016 ). They are well-established organisations helping to meet both the local/global needs in many fields including education, outreach and human well-being (Rakow and Lee, 2015; Blackmore, 2017 ; Hartigan, 2017;  Neves, 2019) . They are ambitious facilities regarding social justice and environmental justice (Dodd and Jones, 2010 ; Neves, 2019 ). In this regard, Global Greens underlined (2017); 4: … social justice is the equitable distribution of social and natural resources, both locally and globally, to meet basic human needs unconditionally. We declare that there is no social justice without environmental justice, and no environmental justice without social justice.   The role of BGs is important concerning social justice and environmental justice that are related to social and spatial inclusion. Social and environmental responsibility is interconnected that contribute to human well-being (Kumar and Reddy, 2007; Breslow et al., 2016)  and the work of BGs demonstrate this (Kuzevanov and Sizykh, 2006;  Lynch, 2015) . In order to broaden their audiences, BGs work with communities and funding bodies.Many gardens are publicly funded organisations means that they are increasingly required to be accountable to that public, encouraging site development and broader audience engagement.  In many cases, to get funding to survive and thrive, they need to demonstrate evidence for such actions (Dodd and Jones, 2010 ; 5–6).   BGs have opportunities to contribute to greater action on worldwide moral issues by raising consciousness on issues of social and environmental justice (Dodd and Jones, 2010 ). They have worked with national, regional and international networks but this requires to achieve a step change by the strategic action they take together (Blackmore, 2017 ). "BGs can collaborate with local communities towards wider socio-environmental justice and equity. This social movement thus brings biodiversity conservation back into ‘everyone’s back yard ’  " (Neves, 2019  -; 8). From this perspective, BGs are at the forefront of in terms of social justice and environmental justice.  5 Botanic gardens and sustainable development goals “Achieving many of the 17 SDGs require the careful conservation and stewardship of the Earth’s botanical diversity”  (Blackmore, 2017 ; 294). BGs have a big role in bringing this vision of the future (Blackmore, 2017 ). The global goals are important to meet the needs of the global community. They can be an instrument for BGs to collaborate with local/global community to indicate their commitment to the connection between plants and human wellbeing (Sharrock and Jackson, 2018 ; Blackmore, 2017 ). Although Blackmore (2017)  highlighted five SDGs (2, 4, 11, 13 and 15) are as notably related to BGs, they can engage in all 17 global goals. They globally hold differing practices; thereby, showing differing associations with the SDGs (Alford et al., 2022 ). Practices of some BGs have specific alignment with certain the SDGs. For instance, the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew develops researches to decrease level of hunger by supporting ‘‘Zero hunger’’—SDG 2, it engages in agricultural activities in some poor communities like Southern Africa and Mozambique (Hudson et al., 2018 ). Other example is the Arnold Arboretum that has alignment with “Quality education”—SDG 4, by its on-site research enabling the foundation for the outreach programs (Thompson, 2018 ). Besides, Chicago Botanic Garden has engaged in partnerships with community health centers to support “Health and Wellbeing” —SDG 3 (Waylen, 2006 ). As for the case of this paper, the five highlighted goals were used— starting from the most associated SDG 15.  6 Analysis of the Case Studies regarding the SDGs SDG 15—Life on land  The SDG 15 involves twelve targets to promote life on land including biodiversity and ecosystems, forests, mountains and wetlands. But specifically four targets are associated with the comparative case study analysis, as described below:(United Nations, 2015 ; 27) Target 15.1.  “…ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial…in particular forests, wetlands… ” Target 15.2. “.promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, …increase afforestation and reforestation globally. ” Target 15.5.  “… protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species. ” Target 15.a. “Mobilize and significantly increase financial resources from all sources to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity and ecosystems. ” In 2020, Executive Officer of the EP highlighted “Eden is a social enterprise, demonstrating that doing business can work hand in hand with improving the environment and people's livelihoods, and building stronger communities.”  The EP created several projects or centers to support social inclusion, environmental justice and economical welfare (Prance, 2002;  Jones, 2008,  Table 2 ). For example, first, it created Reforestation Project  (RP) as a nonprofit nongovernmental organisation that works in developing countries to protect ecosystems, and decrease climate change. It is a non-profit initiative whose mission is to generate fair wage employment to poor villagers as means of worldwide forest restoration that is direct link to the Target 15.a  (relevant Target 10.2 ). The objective relies on positive socioeconomic and environmental results through fostering plant growth, safeguarding large-scale reforestation as well as improving agriculture and carbon sequestration. The company executives support colleges and organizations globally in activities such as saving destroyed rainforests, e.g. Thailand (Jones, 2008 ; 135–6) as a direct contribution to Target 15.2.  and 15.5  Besides, corporate partners economically support forest sustainability in many developing countries including Madagascar, Mozambique, Kenya (Table 2 , Eden Reforestation, 2022 ) as direct contribution to the Target 15.a  (relevant Target 17.3  ) (Table 2 , Eden Reforestation, 2022 ).  Second, National Wildflower Centre (NWC) of EP demonstrates Eden’s commitment to sustainability. NWC brings together both national and international partners (eg Big Lottery Fund, UK, Asus, Panasonic, Exeter University) by many activities on education, horticulture… that promotes Target 4.6, 4.c, 11.4. 15.1, 15.2, 15.a  and 17.3  (Table 2  ). NIE also works with partners to contribute to harmonious coexistence of human and nature. First, together with Research Center for Endangered Species,  NIE carries out the ecological research. Thus, it helps to set up national policies by preserving biodiversity and natural ecosystems to manage wildlife. It supports to establish national policies by doing various activities for conserving biodiversity and natural ecosystems, and managing wildlife. Second, with Korea Forest Service (KFS), the NIE operates to cultivate forests. The organisation fosters alternative habitats including national park, provincial park, wildlife sanctuary, and breeding place. It works to manage habitats and securing manpower. Besides, threatening factor control is significant for prevention of poaching and human approach and removing pollutants. Third, NIE Wetland Center  works to build label as an institution specializing in wetland conservation (Table 2 ). It aims to reinforce national cooperation for wetland conservation and expand education on wetland conservation by wetland survey and research. In this way, the NIE promotes Targets 15.1, 15.2, 15.5, 5.5.a, 14.2, 11.4, 17.3 . However, KTBG has not this kind of initiation.   SDG 11—Sustainable cities and living spaces The SDG 11 consists of ten targets to enhance inclusive and sustainable environment (United Nations, 2015 ). But here Target 11.7 is linked with the comparative case study analysis. Target-11.7.  ‘‘…provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces, in particular for women and children, older persons and persons with disabilities.”  (United Nations, 2011; 24) The EP incorporates Rainforest Biome and Mediterranean Biome by encapsulating a nature-inspired environment, as depicted in  Fig 2  Rainforest Biome exhibits over 1000 varieties of plants from Tropical Islands, Southeast Asia, West Africa and Tropical South America, in an 18–35 °C garden. Mediterranean Biome also exhibits over 1000 varieties of plant from the Mediterranean, South Africa, California and Western Australia, in a 9–25 °C garden. The EP’s mission is to establish connection between people and the natural world. It is famous for its social role in social justice and inclusion (Dodd and Jones, 2010 ). The EP’s mission is: ‘‘To promote the understanding and responsible management of the vital relationship between plants, people and resources leading to a sustainable future for all ’’(Willison, 2006 ; 11). Besides, this project provides sustainability experience with accessibility for people from different abilities. It gives nature experience for people from different backgrounds, such as homeless people, offenders, prisoners, and unemployed young people (Mysen, 2012 ), to ensure real skills, values and self-respect related with the outside world (Jones, 2008 ). The EP also supports equality by enabling free manual and powered wheelchairs, accessible parking spaces and toilets available and free entry for care givers or personal assistants. However, KTBG and NIE have not yet an active role for supporting Target 11.7 . The NIE is an ecological restoration project (Kim et al., 2021 ) that consists of five interconnected biomes as Tropical (22–35 °C), Desert (8–35 °C), Mediterranean (10–35 °C), Temperate (0 °C temperature), and Polar zone (6–10 °C) whose ecosystems are home to climate-specific plants and animals — Fig. 3 .b  (Yang et al., 2020 ). It also includes outdoor exhibition area (Fig. 3 .a .).A space for hands-on experience where visitors can touch and learn about a wide range of animals and plants that inhabit in the Korean Peninsula Wetland and a wetland in the Aquatic Botanical Garden, where the most representative features of the wetland ecosystem in Korea are observed.   Ecorium Project works with NIE Campus to conserve both native and threatened species, such as mammalian, reptilian in the Republic of Korea. The NIE has an active role to promoting national gains through conservation of endangered freshwater fishes, amphibians, and reptiles (Yoon et al., 2021 ). Each biome of the NIE has been colonized with climate-specific plants and animal (Yang et al., 2020). Additionally, it helps to create a voluntary wetland conservation system. For instance, it supports to strengthen public-private collaboration for endangered species restoration for freshwater fishes, amphibians, and reptiles in South Korea (Yoon et al., 2021 ). It promotes both flora and fauna involving the world’s endangered species, such as penguins, pythons, marine species; fish and flying foxes, which account for 4300 plant variety and 240 animals (National Institute of Ecology, 2022) —in this way the NIE supports Target 15.2.  The NIE is also an important project for this goal. It restores and enhances the ecosystem for protection of natural heritage and urban design. As Yoon et al. (2021)  argued, the Tropical Biome in the NIE relies on the recreation of tropical rainforests in Asia, Central and South America, and Africa among the tropical rainforests with rainfall for all year round (Contribution to the Target 15.1,2,5  and a ). On the other hand, the design consists of three buildings, one of which is in the shape of a butterfly. These buildings are the Butterfly Garden of 2100 m2 , the Insect Museum of 550 m2 , ( Fig. 4 )and the 800 m2  mixed-use buildings with a multi-purpose lobby, offices, a cafe and shopping units. KTBG is home to over 20,000 plants from 98 tropical species and over 10,000 butterflies from 15 distinct species from the Far East, South East Asia, and many other countries providing 26 °C heat and 80% humidity inside (Arup, 2023; Selçuklu Municipality, 2022 ). KTBG is home to over 20,000 plants from 98 tropical species and over 10,000 butterflies from 15 distinct species from the Far East, South East Asia, and many other countries providing 26 °C heat and 80% humidity inside (Arup, 2023 ) In brief, three of the project promotes Target 15.5.  However, the NIE and EP play a pivotal role by their significant actions to reduce environmental degradation. KTBG is an important project for its country; thus, it needs to create mission-based interpretative content in terms of not only environmental justice but also social inclusion.  SDG 13—Climate action The SDG 13 comprises five targets to implement commitment to struggle with climate change and its impacts. Related to this goal, the selected BGs promote three goals below: Target 13.1. ‘‘ 13.1. Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries.” (United Nations, 2015 ; 25). The EP follows-up five approaches to enhance sustainable development. First, it supports nature-based solutions by their wild site projects that are progressing both locally/globally to improve biodiversity and combat with climate change (Eden Project Annual Review, 2022 ; 64). Based at Eden, the NWC and the Living Landscapes Team increased Eden’s wildflower fields from 1.73  to 6.9  hectares in Cornwall. Related to this, cultivated areas are monitored due to Eden's research collaboration with the University of Exeter. Second, this organisation uses renewable energy generation and storage. Geothermal energy plant provides energy saving 500ppm 3  3 “At the current rate of growth in CO2, levels will hit 500 ppm within 50 years, putting us on track to reach temperature boosts of perhaps more than 3 degrees C (5.4°F) .” cause disruptive impacts. (Jones, 2017 )   in heating for Biomes while heating the inside. Third, the EP practices on sustainable operations by geothermal heating, rainwater harvesting, soil production, wasting neutral (Mysen, 2012 ; Eden Project Annual Review, 2022).  Fourth, the project is a partner on geothermal energy 4  4 “Geothermal is the only renewable energy resource that is not affected by the weather; it is on 24 h a day, with plants typically running over 90% of the time”  (Eden Project, 2023).   on its site. Lastly, it gives importance on recycling. In addition, the EP works on landscape restoration to diminish climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, enhance ecosystem health, protect biodiversity. It recycles 54%  of waste context, 19%  of total waste is composted, 23%  of waste are used for energy, 4%  of waste are sent to landfill. The NIE helps to promote environmental knowledge in Korea both national and international level. Collaboration with this project, the Republic of Korea has made environmental agreements with nearly 170 international organizations, such as ‘‘UNs Framework Convention on Climate Change, Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora’’, etc. to provide national development. The NIE makes many environmental agreements at national and international level. This is a hopeful action for social and environmental justice. But KTBG has not yet such kind of a development in terms of climate change measures. Target 13.3 ‘‘ Improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning’’ (United Nations, 2015 ; 25). The EP contributes to awareness on climate emergency by generating corporations and getting funds. It brought wide-ranging installations, like pavilions, that aim to control climate change and biodiversity crises (Evans and Shawn, 2004; Mysen, 2012 ; Upton, 2020 ). The organisation delivered the Eden Project Pavilion  at the UK-hosted 2021 COP26 in Glasgow by partnering Grimshaw. This project tries to bombard its visitors with sustainability messages on climate change and provides free entry. In addition, it has made collaboration with Volvo Car UK that has enabled the organisation with a fleet of XC40 Recharge  pure electric vehicles. This collaboration purposes to inspire and educate visitors on how people can protect the planet. The EP received a Cultural Recovery Fund  (CRF) to create sustainable performance across site that explores new ways of delivering storytelling and shortform content. This programme speaks environmental issues and the climate emergency and support the local creative ecology through creatives with a connection to Cornwall (EP Annual Report, 2022; 15). The EP supports environmental justice by a number of strategies operational practices, collaborative partnerships and fundings to encourage social and environmental narratives (Contribution to Target 13.3, 17.3).  One of the climate change events of the NIE is Climate change probe ER9715  that was designed in 2018 to create an ecological district-practice corner. It consists of four exhibition spaces. The first space is ‘Climate Change Crisis Around the World ’ that is a place where visitors can learn on the causes of greenhouse gases, global warming, by an interactive experience. The second space called as 'The Effects of Climate Change on the Ecosystem ', introduced animals and plants that are vulnerable to climate change. Besides, global warming impacts on the habitats of animals and plants were observed through the touch screen ( Fig. 5 d). The third space, 'Efforts to respond to climate change' , demonstrates researches of the National Institute of Ecology's on climate change and conservation measures. The fourth space is 'Creating Eco-Earth Together-Practice Corner ' that was designed so that people can directly learn ways to slow down climate change by practicing in daily life, such as energy saving and recycling. This pop-up exhibition was designed to integrate display and education on climate change, to celebrate 5th  anniversary of the opening of the National Institute of Ecology. Also, one of the exhibitions of the NIE is the 'Sea Turtle and Plastic Exhibition' that informed the dangers of plastic to the ecosystem in 2019. The aim of this exhibition was to raise awareness of the plastic pollution and it expressed the bitter reality on the ecosystem, such as sea turtles suffering from plastic. Moreover, the NIE tackles with the deteriorating conditions for sustaining biodiversity. Thus, it has following aims: [1] carrying out studies for ecosystem change against climate change, [2] fostering regional development by the ecological industry. It also works with NIE campus to improve the ecosystem of the Korean Peninsula against climate change impacts. In cooperation with the NIE campus, Casebook of Climate Change Adaptation in Ecological Field  (2018) was published —Fig. 5 .c. The book focuses on climate change adaptation actions in the national and international ecology fields. The purpose of this research is to encourage studies on changes in climate control of major ecosystems through climate zones (National Institute of Ecology, 2022). With respect to this, the NIE proposes ecological sector adaptation policies and research programs in ‘five overseas countries’, involving Germany, Japan, Australia and the UK. This research includes ‘ecological sector climate change risk assessment’ and ‘national adaptation program’ (Vision21News, 2022 ). Here, due to environmental adaptation policies, the NIE supports Target 13.1  and Target 13.3 . However, KTBG has not yet a specific activity in terms of these Targets. It should also immediately engage in climate change measures. In brief, works of the projects support the SDG 13 except KTBG. KTBG should also immediately engage in climate change measures.  SDG 4— Quality education  The SDG 4 consists of ten targets to enhance quality education. But here, Targets-4.5, 4.7  and 4.c . are linked with the comparative case study analysis, as shown below. Target-4.5. ‘‘ Eliminate all discrimination in education …ensure equal access to all levels of education. for the vulnerable, including persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and children in vulnerable situations”  (United Nations, 2015 ; 19). Promoted as educational charity, the EP is prominent for this research because of its outreach context in education for sustainability that is crucial in the non-formal learning centers sector. The Youth Environmental Service of Eden also aims to generate new pathways for diverse and disadvantaged young people to engage in a green career, with year-long paid work placements at environmental organisations across the UK (Eden Project Annual Review, 2022 ) Target-4.7. ‘‘…ensure all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development …’’ (United Nations, 2015 ; 19). The EP Learning Center enables formal learning opportunities with undergraduate degrees, and postgraduate programs. The former head of the EP, states that “It’s amazing to see young people working alongside world class experts in our unique biomes – seeing their passion ignited by working on some of the most pressing issues for our planet is truly inspirational.”  It allows free special education context for disengaged people in order to decline vulnerabilities in the society. As it did with a pilot project is at the high—security prison on Dartmoor, the organisation educates prisoners to cultivate food, create a connection with nature so that they easily fit into society (Mysen, 2012 ). This initiative has become a main programme empowering many prisons in the UK by establishing a sustainable development in disadvantaged communities (Mysen, 2012 ). In addition, the NIE project encourages and respects with universal equity standards such as the UN Charter on Human Rights. It forbids all discrimination regardless of gender, age, race, disability, religion, political orientation, and region of origin in employment and appreciates diversity (National Institute of Ecology, 2022 ). However, KTBG has not yet such kind of a social attempt accept its special education trainings notably for children having special needs such as autistic children (Yilmaz and Taş, 2018 ; Selçuklu Municipality, 2016a; 2016b ). Target-4.c  “…the supply of qualified teachers, including through international cooperation for teacher training in developing countries, especially least developed countries.”  (United Nations, 2015 ; 19). The EP does a global partnerships works to build collaborative projects that provide social and environmental benefits. Part of the EP International, the Eden Project North is set to open in Morecambe Bay and will include a place-based program of education. Besides, National Wildflower Centre established New Wildflower Habitats in urban areas of Dundee, Morecambe and Liverpool in 2022. Seven sites were seeded in Dundee, funded by the Alexander Concur Trust and NatureScot. A further eleven sites were prepared in Morecambe, funded in partnership with Playstation and Lancaster City Council. This contributes to the Target 17.3.  The EP, NIE and KTBG promote several environmental education contexts for society (Bowker, 2002; Mysen, 2012; Temperton et al., 2014; Rudneva et al., 2016 ; Yilmaz and Taş, 2018 ). They educate their visitors by various methods ( Table 3 ). Despite the small tropical setting, exhibitions in KTBG are unique for Turkey including butterflies grown only here in the country. Showroom and cinema area, displays and lectures at KTBG suggest insight into butterfly lifecycle, classification and behavior (Yilmaz and Taş, 2018 ). While the EP and NIE are offering various ecosystem models through indoor, outdoor and online settings (Mysen, 2012; Kim et al., 2021 ), KTBG provides only an indoor environment for nature education (Table 3 ). Moreover, school visits to the three gardens are common features of them. School visits to the EP and NIE enrich and expand the curriculum regarding sustainability education (Bowker, 2002; Mysen, 2012 ; Temperton, 2014).  For the EP, visits of primary schools integrate teaching programmes permanently into curriculum focusing on student-initiated questioning within the informal education. (Table 3 ) (Bowker, 2002; Upton, 2020 ). As for the NIE, curriculum context is related to the ecology and endangered species such as play-type ecological education increasing interest in environmental awareness (Blewitt, 2004 ; Temperton, 2014 ). But, according to Yilmaz and Taş (2018) , and Demirel and Özcan (2020) , for KTBG, no information has yet to accessible concerning the link between education and the school curriculum. KTBG should adapt nature education model that associated with the school curriculum as in the EP and NIE. Ecorium Education Program is based on ecology and sustainability contexts that is connected with the free semester system. The education program in the NIE enables visitors to discover various types of careers, like the EP organisation. Different from the NIE and KTBG, the purpose of the EP is also to trigger pro-environmental behaviors addressing emotions and feelings via art and culture. Here, creativity is foremost actors of sustainability to develop a vision for attracting people by fresh stories. For example, theatre technique is prominent for environmental learning experience (Upton, 2020 ). EP’s Director of Education and Messaging mentions, “At Eden we use a quite theatrical approach to engage the emotions straight away (…)” (Blewitt, 2010 ; 65). Especially, filming on environmental education is important for children plays, such as ‘Blue Peter’. In brief, despite the differences in quality and quantity in their education, the three projects deliver both formal and non-formal learning programs. The latter is beyond the formal learning model. It is given outside of formal learning organizations, but it is provided within an organizational framework (La Belle, 1982 ). Turnhout and Neves (2019)  refer, non-formal learning as ‘lay expertise’ is generally described as the opposite of formal knowledge since it is seen to be: contextual and localized instead of universal; culturally embedded instead of objective. Regarding informal learning, no borders for education and no formal curriculum are undertaken, but lifelong education is forefront. Concerning non-formal education, Sauve discusses that: "Education for life (eco-social life), education as a process of life, needs to be supported by sound institutional policies and strategies, as well informal education systems as in nonformal organizations and initiatives " (2017; 120 ). It highlights non-formal education settings need to be strengthened at a policy level. This underlines the role of BGs that creates an environment for lifelong learning.  SDG 2—End hunger The SDG 2 includes eight targets to fight against global food crisis. Of specific relevance to this goal, the selected BGs depends on Target 2.5  and 2.1,  as described below. Target 2.1. “…end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious and sufficient food. ” (United Nations, 2015 ; 17). Target-2.5.  ‘‘…maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals and their related wild species. ’’ (United Nations, 2015 ; 17). The NIE has farming and planting activities that rely on Seocheon Agricultural Garden that is a 5,110 m2  area containing rice fruit trees, vegetation (e.g., ramie) due to its locational advantage. It is near Geumguri and Yonghwasil Pond. The former is a 4,63 m2  area that is home to many plants (e.g. common reed). The latter is a 68199 m2  habitat for several aquatic plants (e.g. willow and birds). Here, alluvial soil and sufficient water supply are fruitful for aquaculture and seaweed farming. In this project, implementation of national wetland policies come to forefront. Here, NIE Wetland Center actively works on 27 sites  and 132.265  
                     km 2   (Table 2 ) for wetland conservation and management by conducting surveys and researches. This center develops programs where stakeholders related to the values of wetland can participate. The NIE also supports the Target 2.5, 6.6 , 14.2  and 14.3.  In the EP, visitors can enjoy many edible gardens involving olive, banana, pineapple. Additionally, they can benefit from ‘Positive Food Futures’  course that enables food activity experience with up to 10 participants. This course is effective to grow several foods (e.g. superabundance fruit, crab apple etc.). Here, horticulturists provide visitors with tips on the planting of native trees in an edible garden for visitors' own homes encouraging the Target 4.7.  Besides, growing plant helps absorbing carbon from the atmosphere, which contributes global warming supporting the Target 13.1.  The EP also works with the National Wildflower Centre (NWC) created new wildflower habitats in urban areas of Dundee, Morecambe and Liverpool in 2022. Seven sites were seeded in Dundee (funded by Alexander Concur Trust and NatureScot ) and eleven sites were prepared in Morecambe, (funded in partnership with Play station and Lancaster City Council ). The NWC founded a new seedbank to augment its conservation works and gained funding for PhD students of EP to train genetic diversity of wildflower seed stock in 2022 (Annual Report 2022; 50) which supports Target 4.7.  Moreover, the EP horticultural activities are prominent due to supports of its local/global partners. For instance, Iceland  is some of the EP partners that is a local supermarket who has decreased ‘‘their food waste by 19.2% since 2018 and redistributed 3.5 million meals across communities’’ between the years of 2021 and 2022. As part of Eden’s community development programme, funded by Healthworks for Cornwall, some visitors were introduced to the garden by “their GPs and housing associations and others ‘self-referred’ after finding out about the various courses they could undertake”. As well as introducing people who had never gardened to the joys of vegetable growing , …"(Annual Review 2022; 45 )  . This promotes the Target 4.5.  On the other hand, KTBG has not yet such planting or farming activities. However, it has started the School Garden and Insect House Project  (2022) with 4 primary schools in Konya with Selçuklu Municipality. Within the project scope, agricultural activities offer students experiential learning and practical skills on horticulture. This BG should also adapt more activities and educational context upon planting or farming. Briefly, all three projects promote sustainable agriculture and nutrition requirements, the Target-2.5 . In this way, they also support the Target 1.1, as relevant .  7 Results and discussion This section presents the key findings of the case study analysis on how BGs are contributing to the SDGs in terms of social and environmental justice. For this analysis, 17 SDGs and 169 Targets were examined. In the analysis, 5 Goals and 12 Targets (15.1,15.2,15.5,15.a,13.1,13.3,11.7,4.5,4.7,4.c,2.5,2.1) were determined as directly associated to the projects ( Table 4 ). The SDGs are not a set of stand-alone goals, but should be considered as an associated targets. In the analysis, relevant targets: 1.1, 6.6, 8.6. 8.9, 10.2, 14.2 are also important for the research. In light of the data, although the Goal 15 along with 13,11,4,2 are the most prominent global goal for this study, all 17 global goals are worthy of review and analyze when considering works of BGs. This cross-national comparative case study analysis indicated different countries lead to different opportunities or challenges. It is notable that while the EP is making a big effort for global community development, the NIE relatively focuses on national development. The EP puts efforts on outreach initiatives. The organisation underpins social and environmental role by its local/global collaborations and fundings. During the research it was observed that even on the website of the EP, it invites people by the words of “Help support our.projects.”  On the other hand, the NIE highlights the value of collaborative action plan with municipality for environmental justice and social justice. KTBG is also hopeful project for its country regarding environmental justice, equity and inclusion but needs to fast development. Results underline the role of BGs can be a valuable input for the SDGs concerning social and environmental justice.  8 Conclusion Paying attention to the UN's global call, this paper described the framework of three inter-linked themes by which the study focused on as the case study analysis. It gave an overview of the different research from a multiple perspectives to support the SDGs. In this regard, the changing and developing role of BGs is crucial in the global era. Traditional BGs have served for a wide range of needs and those needs have evolved through time to meet the changing needs of society (Oldfield, 2009; Blackmore, 2017; Mackay, 2018 ; Smith, 2019 ). Now, BGs serve to address many global environmental issues such as biodiversity conservation, climate change, food systems, community outreach (Vergou and Willison, 2014;  Neves, 2019 ) and environmental education (Zelenika et al., 2018 ). They are currently urged to achieve the majority of society and leading a social role (Dodd and Jones, 2010 ) that involves developing dedication to work with local and global communities concerning general issues of social and environmental importance for a sustainable future (Vergou and Willison, 2013 ; 2014 ). Just less then seven years left to achieve the SDGs, urgent global action is necessary for nature and human well-being. The foremost step belongs to the directors of BGs to create an opportunity for environmental and social justice. Thus, governments, public and private sectors must take an immediate action adopting an integrated framework regarding environmental justice and social inclusion so that bringing societies closer to accomplishing the UN agenda until 2030.
