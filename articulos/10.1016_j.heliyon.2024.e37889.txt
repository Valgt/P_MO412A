                  A study was conducted in Sylhet at Jaintiapur Upazila to determine the prospects of Moringa-based homestead concerning Sustainable Development Goals. A household survey was conducted following a simple random sampling of 135 farmers and following a semi-structured questionnaire and interview schedule with 100 farmers (40 identified Moringa-based adopters and 60 non-adopters). The final questionnaire was prepared after pilot testing, which contained data on common species diversity, and the perception of farmers regarding SDGs indicators of “no poverty, zero hunger, good health, and well-being, gender equality, affordable and clean energy, decent work and economic growth”. The extent of agreement was recorded following the points Likert scale high (3) to no change (0), and the SDG index (SDGI) value was calculated. The 10 key informant interviews were conducted with non-adopters to get insights into their perception regarding Moringa-based homesteads. The findings revealed that the status of plant species diversity such as betel nut (100 %), mango (100 %), bean (99 %), and arjun (90 %) was higher in comparison to non-adopters where the status of the respective species was 92 %, 99 %, 89 %, and 73 % respectively. The perception assessment revealed that 100 % of adopters and 90 % of non-adopters believed that Moringa-based homesteads had the potential to increase access to food, nutrition, and medicinal resources. While the majority of 70 % of adopters, and 90.5 % non-adopters disagreed that it had the potential to ensure government access and non-government credit resources. Among the Moringa-based homestead adopters, the gross income derived from Moringa sales was 2828.57 ± 1481.45, where 55 % of homesteads were identified to have Moringa plants between 3 and 5, and homesteads solely supplied fuel materials for 40 % of households. Gender participation was quite evident for homestead farming activities, where female participation was higher in planting, weeding, irrigation, and fencing. Homesteads provided both on-farming and off-farming income opportunities where major responses were found for poultry farming (96 %), vegetable farming (95 %), and day labor (97 %). Farmers were found to practice climate-smart practices of homestead agroforestry (100 %), rainwater harvesting (99 %), weeding (98 %), and management of debris (95 %) in their respective homesteads. The results disclosed that Moringa-based homestead in Sylhet can be a potential option for attaining SDGs indicators of escalation of household income (SDGI = 90), access to food, nutrition, and medicinal resources (SDGI = 103.6), facilitation of natural treatment of diseases (SDGI = 104.6), de-escalation of gender discrepancy in terms of production activities (SDGI = 103.64), own source of fuel (SDGI = 58.44), both off-farm and on-farm income opportunity (SDGI = 100.52), ecosystem health maintenance by resilient practices (SDGI = 104.6). Farmers ranked food security capacity as a major motivational factor, while the low economic return was a major demotivational factor. The escalation of Moringa-based homesteads needs to be prioritized while facilitating credit, and institutional support to extend encouragement to non-adopters for wider integration of Moringa-based homesteads, and appropriate utilization of the existing resources for greater profitability.

Climate-Smart Agriculture & Geospatial Lab Department of Agroforestry and Environmental Science Faculty of Agriculture Sylhet Agricultural University Sylhet 3100 Bangladesh       A study was conducted in Sylhet at Jaintiapur Upazila to determine the prospects of Moringa-based homestead concerning Sustainable Development Goals. A household survey was conducted following a simple random sampling of 135 farmers and following a semi-structured questionnaire and interview schedule with 100 farmers (40 identified Moringa-based adopters and 60 non-adopters). The final questionnaire was prepared after pilot testing, which contained data on common species diversity, and the perception of farmers regarding SDGs indicators of “no poverty, zero hunger, good health, and well-being, gender equality, affordable and clean energy, decent work and economic growth”. The extent of agreement was recorded following the points Likert scale high (3) to no change (0), and the SDG index (SDGI) value was calculated. The 10 key informant interviews were conducted with non-adopters to get insights into their perception regarding Moringa-based homesteads. The findings revealed that the status of plant species diversity such as betel nut (100 %), mango (100 %), bean (99 %), and arjun (90 %) was higher in comparison to non-adopters where the status of the respective species was 92 %, 99 %, 89 %, and 73 % respectively. The perception assessment revealed that 100 % of adopters and 90 % of non-adopters believed that Moringa-based homesteads had the potential to increase access to food, nutrition, and medicinal resources. While the majority of 70 % of adopters, and 90.5 % non-adopters disagreed that it had the potential to ensure government access and non-government credit resources. Among the Moringa-based homestead adopters, the gross income derived from Moringa sales was 2828.57 ± 1481.45, where 55 % of homesteads were identified to have Moringa plants between 3 and 5, and homesteads solely supplied fuel materials for 40 % of households. Gender participation was quite evident for homestead farming activities, where female participation was higher in planting, weeding, irrigation, and fencing. Homesteads provided both on-farming and off-farming income opportunities where major responses were found for poultry farming (96 %), vegetable farming (95 %), and day labor (97 %). Farmers were found to practice climate-smart practices of homestead agroforestry (100 %), rainwater harvesting (99 %), weeding (98 %), and management of debris (95 %) in their respective homesteads. The results disclosed that Moringa-based homestead in Sylhet can be a potential option for attaining SDGs indicators of escalation of household income (SDGI = 90), access to food, nutrition, and medicinal resources (SDGI = 103.6), facilitation of natural treatment of diseases (SDGI = 104.6), de-escalation of gender discrepancy in terms of production activities (SDGI = 103.64), own source of fuel (SDGI = 58.44), both off-farm and on-farm income opportunity (SDGI = 100.52), ecosystem health maintenance by resilient practices (SDGI = 104.6). Farmers ranked food security capacity as a major motivational factor, while the low economic return was a major demotivational factor. The escalation of Moringa-based homesteads needs to be prioritized while facilitating credit, and institutional support to extend encouragement to non-adopters for wider integration of Moringa-based homesteads, and appropriate utilization of the existing resources for greater profitability.   Keywords Moringa  Homestead agroforestry  Sustainable development goals (SDGs)  Food security  Livelihood improvement    1 Introduction  The overexploitation of natural resources, mainly agricultural and forest land, has become a worldwide issue and problematic to the population living and depend on them for sustenance [1 ]. Environmental degradation has brought significant changes both socially and economically among the local communities by impacting ecological dynamics [2 ] and agricultural sustainability. South Asia is experiencing rapid energy consumption, industrialization, and urbanization due to rapid economic expansion and population growth due to which environmental sustainability is at risk, and carbon dioxide emissions are increasingly extreme in Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, SriLanka and Nepal [3 ]. Bangladesh's economy is mainly dependent on agriculture, which plays a significant part in boosting the national economy of the nation. Agriculture contributes roughly 13.02 percent of the GDP [4 ]. Bangladesh is susceptible to climatic hazards due to its geographical location and the nation's natural resources are being depleted due to the growing population [5 ], where attaining Sustainable Development Goals has become challenging, and people are still fighting against hunger, malnutrition, inequality, and unemployment. In the coastal area of Bangladesh, climate change has affected local habitation, which indicates urgent integration of nature-based solutions to protect the water and environmental resources [6 ] that effectively support ecological strategy. In the real scenario, ecological strategy is optimized by the wider adaptation that contributes to biodiversity conservation [7 ], empowering the rural economy, carbon sequestration, and climate change mitigation [8 ]. In response to this situation, agroforestry is one of the most effective ways to balance economic, environmental, and social benefits since it may simultaneously improve rural livelihoods, nutrition security, and several ecological benefits [9 ]. To meet local demand along with conserving environmental resources and sustainable livelihood opportunities agroforestry is a sustainable approach where the resources support the necessities of the household, like food and fuelwood security, and help pay for things like housing, healthcare, and sanitation, as well as meeting educational costs [10 ]. Sylhet is located in the northeastern section of the country and is one of the most vulnerable districts to adverse climate impacts due to catastrophic events like flooding [11 ], earthquakes, and land degradation. It is also such flash floods in Sylhet are not in control, and they affect the livelihood of farmers and drive them to alternative occupations rather than agriculture [12 ]. In this scenario, in the northern part of Bangladesh, agroforestry has embarked on a sustainable approach in response to rapid climate hazards such as flash floods which influence climate change mitigation [13 ]. Homestead agroforestry is one such system that has been shown to facilitate improvements in the socioeconomic status of the farmers and increase farm productivity [14 ] alongside providing ecological and regulatory benefits [15 ], and escalated household income [16 ]. The Moringa-based homestead is such kind of homestead agroforestry practice that is quite famous in Sylhet, Bangladesh, where the Moringa plants are quite famous due to their diversified use as vegetables, medicines [17 ], and emergence as a superfood. While the functional properties and use of Moringa are visible, in the practical scenario the species has the least recognition in escalation of food security, and livelihood improvement. Bangladesh is targeting to achieve SDGs through nature-based solutions such as agroforestry [18 ] and homestead agroforestry which are the most powerful approaches to address most of the SDGs directly or indirectly particularly no poverty, zero hunger, good health, and well-being, gender equality, affordable and clean energy, decent work and economic growth; though in the real scenario the prospects of particular homestead concerning to SDG is not explored yet [19 ]. The people living in Jaintiapur of Sylhet depend on homestead farming such as Moringa-based homesteads and black pepper farming to secure food requirements and livelihood improvement [20 ]. However, there is a dearth of research on nature-based solutions to address the feasibility of SDG achievement which triggered to investigation of the perceived contribution of Moringa-based homesteads to achieve SDGs. Hence the research aimed to determine the prospects of Moringa-based homesteads to address SDGs “no poverty, zero hunger, good health and well-being, gender equality, affordable and clean energy, decent work and economic growth”. Assessing the Moringa-based homestead's contribution to the SDGs can improve our existing knowledge and research with additional regional case studies alongside serving as a baseline for future studies. In developing countries like Bangladesh, Moringa-based homesteads may add new dimensions to food and nutrition security, living standard improvement by poverty alleviation and income opportunity generation, and women empowerment, and can emerge as a practical approach to SDG achievement.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Location of the study area The study was conducted at Jaintiapur Upazila in Sylhet district. The study area's geographical coordinates are between 24′59′ and 25′11′ north latitudes and between 92′03′ and 92′14′ east longitudes with an area of 256.69 sq km (Fig. 1  ). The Nijpat Union has enormous natural resources and people in this locality have been dependent on homestead farming for many years. Moringa-based homesteads are almost disappearing and recently the place marked a significant contribution to support super food production and commercialization. The existence of Moringa species and homestead produce received the attention of Sylhet Agricultural University, Department of Agroforestry and Environmental Science. Consequently, this region required investigation regarding Moringa-based homestead production and its feasibility for local livelihood improvement. The Moringa-based homestead production practices include planting diverse species, animal husbandry, maintaining planting time, planting quality variety, watering, mulching, applying minimum tillage, composting, manuring, planting a cover crop, following rotation, debris management, homestead agroforestry, rainwater harvesting, plant protection measures, stalking, pruning, training, fencing, harvesting, and marketing.  2.2 Sampling procedure The study's basic data collocation was done using a simple random sampling technique involving 135 farmers. Among the farmers, 35 were not involved in any farming activities, 60 farmers were directly or indirectly involved in farming activities whether in the forms of monocropping, agroforestry homestead agroforestry, etc. other than Moringa-based homestead adopters, and 40 farm families were identified as involved in Moringa-based homestead adoption. Those 40 farmers were the target group to proceed with determining study objectives.  2.3 Field visit and data collection The study was conducted following mixed methods. Data was collected from primary sources following a semi-structured questionnaire, farmers interviews, and focus group discussions. Initially, the questionnaire was pretested following pilot test with key informants for the respondents' clarity, acceptability, and comprehensiveness. A total of 10 homestead site was visited and owners were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. As a result, the preliminary survey schedule was developed, altered, and changed. As a result, the research supervisor's recommendations, comments, and logical sequences were the foundation for creating the final survey schedule. Initially, the study was conducted to get insights into the differences in scenarios among moringa-based homestead adopters and non-adopters based on the species diversity and their perception regarding its prospects towards SDGs. Preliminary, common species diversity was recorded and a direct site visit was done to get a deeper understanding and validation of the information provided by respondents. Later, respondents' perception and extent of agreement on prospects of Moringa-based homestead towards SDGs indicators of “no poverty, zero hunger, good health, and well being, gender equality, affordable and clean energy, decent work and economic growth” [19 ] were recorded from both adopters and non-adopters and SDG index value was determined. The degree of agreement was measured using the Likert scale and responses were recorded on a scale from one to three (High = 3, Moderate = 2, Slight = 1, No Change = 0). 10 key informant interviews were conducted with non-adopters to determine their disinterest in moringa-based homestead production. After interviewing non-adopters, we moved on to the next part which was our main study objective to determine the prospects of moringa-based homesteads towards SDGs. The part of the questionnaire involving adopters had main three sections: the households’ basic profile, determining the contribution of the Moringa-based homestead based on maximum agreement, and motivational and demotivational factors. The basic profile included data such as age, education, family size, training experience, homestead size, annual farm income, producer type, credit receiver, extension help, organizational involvement, duration of involvement in moringa-based homestead production, and knowledge level regarding moringa production. The prospects of Moringa-based homestead in the aspect of SDGs were identified based on the maximum agreement found for a particular indicator from each SDG. Meanwhile, motivational and demotivational factors of Moringa-based homestead production were determined following semi-structured interviews and ranked according to their opinion. The interview was voluntary, and it was held from March 2022 to June 2022, and September 2022 to December 2022. Additionally, five focus group discussions were used to cross-check all chosen indicators after open discussions with respondents and family members. Ethical consent forms were signed by all respondents.  2.4 Data analysis The data from each interview schedule was coded, compiled, tabulated, and analyzed after the field survey was completed using SPSS and Microsoft Excel. Responses from interviews were collected through recording and later transcribed. Number-coded value was given to the responses for data analysis. The data distribution, the prevailing social understanding, and potential grading systems were all considered while creating these categories. SDG indicator and extent of the agreement were calculated using a four-point rating scale with 3, 2, and 1, 0 for high, moderate, slight, and no change respectively, and the SDG index (SDGI) value was calculated based on the individual response and aggregated responses of the respondents to each statement. In the case of SDGI, higher values indicate the greatest contribution to the indicated parameter. Statistical measures were used to express the data, including frequency count, percentage, mean, standard deviation, and rank. We looked for possible relationships between a few respondents' characteristics and their participation in a moringa farm using Pearson's correlation coefficient (r). The t -test and one-way ANOVA were used to determine the statistically significant differences among variables, and Multiple Linear Regression was used to identify the determinants. Five percent and one percent probability levels were used to reject or accept null hypotheses.   3 Results and discussions 3.1 Understanding differences among moringa-based homestead adopters and non-adopters The Nijpat union and farmers living in the locality possessed a wide range of species diversity. The results on the observed species involve a list of common plant species that are observed among both Moring-based homestead adopters and non-adopters. The species richness among the adopters was quite visible as the percentage of farmers possessing the plant species was quite high compared to non-adopters of homestead producers. Table 1   represents the reflection of common plant species observed among the identified group. Among the identified common fruit species (Fig. 2  ), the Moringa-based homestead adopters had dominant fruit species of betel nut (100 %), mango (100 %), jackfruit (97 %), coconut (98 %), and papaya (98 %). Vegetable species diversity revealed that among the identified vegetable species, the most dominant vegetable species observed was Bean (99 %), okra (98 %), red amaranth (94 %), and brinjal (89 %). Among the timber species, farmers preferred mahogany (88 %), koroi (78 %), and raintree (78 %). Among the identified medicinal species, Arjuna (90 %), followed by Neem (87 %) and Tamarind (80 %). The observed common species were relatively possessed by the least farmers compared to the adopter's group except corm (56 %), sisso (24 %), guava (80 %), and litchi (33 %).  3.2 Perception of farmers regarding moringa-based homesteads and its feasibility in addressing SDGs Among the SDGs indicators maximum extent of agreement found from each SDG was Escalation of household income (no poverty, SDGI = 90), Access to food, nutrition, and medicinal resources (zero hunger, SDGI = 103.6), Facilitation of natural treatment of diseases (good health and well-being, SDGI = 104.6), de-escalation of gender discrepancy in terms of production activities (gender equality, SDGI = 103.64), own source of fuel (affordable and clean energy, SDGI = 58.44), both off-farm and on-farm income opportunity (decent work and economic growth, SDGI = 100.52), ecosystem health maintenance by resilient practices (life on land, SDGI = 104.6). 100 % of adopters agreed that Moringa-based homestead production supported food security, and their nutritional requirement became balanced by the commodities they derive from the resource (SDG index value of 103.6) and both off-farm and on-farm income opportunities (Table 2  ). Around 92 % believed that the homestead plants were resilient enough to protect from certain diseases (SDGI = 104.6). The production was found highly supported by women farmers through their engagement in diverse productive activities. 89 % of farmers believe this production activity was devoid of gender bias. Women's participation is not a myth in productive activities and their contribution to farming activities boosts economic feasibility in the respective family. Meanwhile, around 89 % of the growers agreed that ecosystem health maintenance was supported by the adopted resilient practices. The lowest SDG index value was found for access to govt. and non govt. resources (30 %) and having marketing opportunities and building enterprise (35 %) where the SDGI value stood at 50 and 46, respectively. When the non-preferred moringa-based homestead producers were assessed, it was found that the status of agreement was comparatively lower than those of adopters. Around 90 % of farmers agreed that Moringa-based homestead could have the potential to support nutrition and food accessibility (SDGI = 145.2), whereas only 40 % agreed that it off-farm and on-farm income opportunities (SDGI = 72.6). The Highest SDGI value was found for the indicator of high tree coverage volume where 82 % (SDGI = 142.68) conveyed their high extent of agreement. The maximum number of non-adopters believe that moringa-based homestead practices were not efficient enough for marketing and enterprising opportunity (86 %), energy cost reduction (80 %), and escalation of household income (78 %) where the SDGI stood at 40.2, 41.4, and 41.7 respectively (Table 3  ).  3.3 Understanding the non-adopters' perspective to not prefer moringa-based homestead Question 1 Farmers plant Moringa and introduce diversified species in their homestead where they find the significant potential of Moringa based homestead in diverse aspects such as food, and nutrition security alongside financial benefits. What is your view of not giving importance to Moringa-based homestead?   Response 1: “I don't find any potential difference between a normal homestead and a moringa-based homestead. There are several other species other than Moringa which have the potential to give financial benefit. Two to three years ago, I used to plant timber spices where Mahogony was among the top species which gave me the greater output. ” Response 2: “I am clueless on nutrition security. we eat so that we can live without hunger. And, my family introduce plant species in our homesteads that are easy to grow and require less maintenance because I give more emphasis on off-farm income. My wife and child generally take care of the plants .” Response 3: “I have an interest in moringa-based homesteads but I can't accommodate the high volume of diversified species in my front area because the area is too small and we don't have the capacity”. Question 2 “As we know homestead agroforestry is viable both economically and environmentally. Do not you think, in the climate changing dynamics we should introduce superfoods such as Moringa with others that are rich in compounds, and economically important?”    Response 4: “The climate is indeed changing and the flash flood of 2020 made significant changes in our life. I am not sure about how fruitful it is to  support homestead plantations but I am also scared to  support Moringa-based homesteads because the marketing channel in my region is not up to the mark. Last year I had a huge loss in marketing vegetables. In this case, emphasizing Moringa-based homestead is quite risky. ” Response 5: “I believe that superfood has great opportunities to escalate financial benefit. I prefer black pepper farming as it is super food but due to the restricted marketing channel, I can not make profitability. I had one or two Moringa plVants last year but I had to cut them to evacuate the place to make the house. I don't think these superfoods have a future in our region.” Question 3 “Despite having barren space in your front yard and back yard why you are not willing to adopt a Moringa-based homestead.”   Response 7: “I am the mother of three children and my husband lives in a Middle Eastern country. It is quite complicated to manage as I don't have prior experience with plantation activities. All I prefer is planting annual vegetables requiring the least management practices. I have an interest in Moringa-based homestead but I also feel it is not going to be easy for a woman, as the father of their children has more experience compared to me. ” Response 8: “Yeah. We inherited a great amount of land from our ancestors. Whatever we have today, we inherited land, cattle farm properties, and knowledge. We are oriented to generate a larger amount of benefits from rice cultivation. Last 5 years, we just followed monocropping and we are easily can run our family from the livestock properties and profit generated from rice cultivation. So I don't think Moringaa-based has any special quality.” Question 4 : “ What do you think are the factors that can escalate wider adoption of Moringa-based homesteads integration in this region?”   Response 9: “I can see the prospects of a Moringa-based homestead as the demand is incredible in the present scenario. People are much more health conscious and they want fresh and organic foods. However, farmers are not willing to grow because the economic return is not up to the mark. I believe that transparency in the marketing channel is a pre-requirement to upgrade interest among farmers from where they can see the economic feasibility.” Response10: “From my point of view, I believe most of the farmers are not financially stable here. In this case, if we get the credit from govt. and private organization, it will help the farmers to orient towards a Moringa-based homestead. The price of everything is high and most of the farmers can not afford the maintenance cost.”  3.4 Real scenario from moringa-based homestead adopters view 3.4.1 Farmers basic profile The respondents were classified into three age categories, namely young (below 30 years), middle-aged (31–50 years), and old (above 50 years). The observed mean value for respondents' age was 1.75 ± 0.72 (Table 4  ). The majority of the respondents were middle-aged (45 %), followed by young aged (40 %) and old aged (15 %), respectively. The observed mean value found for education level was 1.13 ± 0.85. That means most respondents (50 %) had a primary education (schooling of 1–5 years), while 22.5 % had no formal education. Only 20 % of respondents had secondary education (6–10), and 7.5 % had tertiary education (above 10 years of schooling). The mean value of respondents’ family size was observed to be 1.7 ± 0.65. 50 % of the respondents had medium family sizes (6–8 members), while 40 % and 10 % of respondents had small (below 6 family members) and large (above 8 family members) family sizes, respectively. 87.5 % received no training experience, whereas only 12.5 % obtained training experience. The mean value of homestead size was 2.00 ± 0.72 where 65 % was small homestead owners (0.21–1 ha), 20 % of homestead owners had marginal landholder (below 0.21 ha), and only 10 % and 5 % of owners had medium (1.1–3 ha) and large (above 3 ha) homestead respectively. 70 % of homestead owners had low farm income (below 1 lac TK) followed by 35 %, and 5 % had medium (1–2 lac) and high (above 2 lac) family income where the mean value identified as 1.45 ± 0.60. Based on producer type regarding Moringa-based homestead production, 70 % were full-time, and 30 % were part-time farmers. While 85 % of respondents received no credit facilities, only 15 % had credit. Similarly, most respondents (92.5 %) had never gotten extension help, while only 7.5 % received extension help. Respondents were categorized into involvement (17.5 %) and non-involvement (82.5 %) in terms of organizational involvement. Respondents were found involved in Moringa-based homestead production on short-term (below 5 years), mid-term (5–10 years), and long-term (above 10 years) basis with the mean value of 1.85 ± 0.70. 50 % of farmers were engaged mid-term, followed by short-term (32.5 %) and long-term (17.5 %). The knowledge level regarding Moringa-based homestead production was categorized into three groups, namely little (below 6 scores), sufficient (6–8 score), and expert (above 8 scores), where the mean value stood at 2.07 ± 0.66. 57.5 % identified having sufficient knowledge, followed by 25 % and 17.5 % the expert and little level of knowledge, respectively. The involvement in Moringa-based homestead production of most farmers was entirely satisfactory, unveiling that this sector is acceptable to the farmers. The satisfactory knowledge level indicates that farmers had a great level of experience, and their knowledge level could strengthen this homestead system. For homestead agroforestry, which primarily offers economic and environmental benefits, farmers integrate and accumulate traditional and indigenous knowledge [21 ].  3.4.2  No poverty:  escalation of household income The Moringa-based homestead generated income opportunities as the products were found to be used both for self-consumption and commercial purposes. The primary income-generating species identified Moringa, Burmese grape, Bean, Cowpea, Cucumber, Gourd, Sweet gourd, Jujube, and Banana. The gross income generated from Moringa-based homestead was categorized into two groups: high gross income (above 3000Tk) and low gross income (below 3000Tk). Among these commercial products, the maximum amount found to be harvested was 100 kg, and the minimum amount was 8 kg, where the mean value stood at 48.62 ± 27.38. A maximum of 20 kg amount was analyzed to be distributed (3.35 ± 3.86) among neighbors and relatives. The cost of production was 1900.769 ± 1793.369 Tk. Meanwhile, the mean value of the amount for own consumption was 8.17 ± 8.15 kg. The number of homestead products that sold near the local market was 35.08 ± 20.29 kg. As a result, gross income generated 4193.8 ± 3169.6. The benefit-cost ratio obtained 48.62 ± 0.97, where maximum and minimum BCR were 3.78 and 0.7, respectively shown in Table 5  .  The income statement from moringa marketing revealed that harvested Moringa ranged from 10 kg to 80 kg with a mean value of 42.14 ± 22.33 and with production cost of 902.857 ± 749.45. The mean value of the distributed amount was found to be 3.21 ± 2.27, where distribution ranged from 0 to 5 kg. A maximum of 25 kg and a minimum of 1.5 kg were consumed for self with a mean value of 8.50 ± 8.25. Therefore, the amount sold for income generation ranged from 8 kg to 55 kg with a mean value of 31.29 ± 16.59. The gross income found a maximum of 4950 Tk and a minimum of 720 TK, where BCR stood a maximum of 3.78 and minimum of 1.44, respectively, with a mean value of 3.09 ± 0.81. The benefit-cost ratio from the income statement revealed that Moringa-based homestead production is income income-generating source along with its capability for food security. This means there is a scope for Moringa-based homesteads to increase the living standard by employing people in income-generation activities. The human capital of the respondents could be improved dramatically by practicing Moringa-based agroforestry and growing their vegetables, and households were able to supplement their income by lessening the need to purchase food from the local market and using this extra income for other purposes to provide a secure livelihood. Dry leaves, stalk, and timber were also important sources of household income that might have contributed to fuelwood supply in Moringa-based homestead agroforestry in Sylhet.  3.4.3  Zero hunger:  access to food, nutrition and medicinal Resource Nutrition, as food security, is a critical concern in Bangladesh as landless and marginal farmers have greater nutritional risks than bigger households. The most practical and ecological alternative would be to encourage the production and utilization of homestead produce, which can meet the fundamental requirement for important vitamins and minerals. Therefore, the status determined in the study area revealed that among the identified common plant species the primary use indicated that 35%were vegetables, 37%were fruits, 17%were timber, and 11%were medicinal species. 55 % of homesteads were identified to have Moringa plants between 3 and 5, while 37.5 % had below 3 plants, and 7.5 % had Moringa plants above 5, as shown in Fig. 3  (a) the frequency of species diversity Fig. 3 (b and c) in Jaintiapur indicated that homestead agroforestry is an adequate reservoir of biodiversity conservation. The topography of the land and soil type is suitable for plantations meeting the demand for food. So, in this study area, plant species diversity was observed, and plants were distributed on different sides of the home garden. Hence, plant diversity in the homestead areas of Jaintiapur Upazila could improve the respondents' livelihood and contribute to biodiversity conservation. The production of crops, mainly fruits and vegetables, may provide Bangladesh with a solution to its potential hunger and malnutrition issues [22 ]. In the homestead vegetable gardening study area, respondents have grown plant and livestock species which broadened the scope of essential nutrient supply such as vitamin A, Vitamin C, calcium, and iron from different vegetables and fruits; the livestock species also find protein. The Pearson correlation was assessed for Moringa plant distribution in the located homesteads with age, education, family size, training experience, homestead size, annual farm income, producer type, credit receiver, extension help, organizational involvement, duration of involvement, knowledge level, fuel source, and gross income represented in Table 6  . The correlation test revealed that moringa plant distribution possessed a non-significant relationship with age, education, family size, training experience, homestead size, annual farm income, extension help, organizational involvement, duration of involvement, knowledge level, fuel source, and gross income. On the other hand, producer type and credit received were found to be significantly correlated with Moringa plant distribution. The computed r-value found 0.491 (producer type) and 0.327 (credit received), which were significant at 0.01 and 0.05 levels, respectively. By increasing their involvement as full-time producers and providing financial facilities, as they showed a strong positive association, the distribution of Moringa plants can produce more. Credit receivers were discovered to be favorably connected with biodiversity (Islam et al., 2018). The independent sample T-test showed that statistically significant differences were found for producer type and credit received (Table 7  ) in Moringa plants distribution (p < 0.05). The mean values were 1.89 ± 0.57 (full-time producer), 1.25 ± 0.45 (part-time producer), 2.17 ± 0.41 (credit receiver), and 1.62 ± 0.60 (non-receiver). Again, multiple linear regressions (Table 8  ) determined the relationship between moringa plant distribution and demographic variables (age, education level, training, annual farm income, homestead cultivation period or time, credit, extension help, organizational involvement, and production involvement) and Fig. 4  (a) indicates scatterplot and Fig. 4 (b) indicates normal p-p plot of regression residuals of Moringa plants. The reference categories were young age, no formal education, no training, low annual farm income, part-time homestead farmers, credit non-receiver, extension help the non-receiver, no involvement in the organization, and short time involvement in production. Independent variables accounted for 42.2 % variability for moringa plant distribution, R2 = 0.422, adj- R2  = 0.098, F = 1.303, and the model was not significant. Only two predictors were at a 5 % level of significance. Tertiary education level (beta = 0.776), and homestead cultivation full-time (beta = 0.586) were found to be significant. The tertiary level of education positively impacted the number of moringa plants distribution compared to no formal education level, while full-time producers experienced higher distribution compared to part-time producers.  3.4.4  Good health and well-being:  facilitation of natural treatment of diseases Respondents of the studied area opined that some plants like Arjuna, Tamarind, Holy basil, Moringa, and Neem were grown in their homestead area for medicinal purposes. The different parts of the plants including leaf, oil, seed, bark, fruit, flower, root, and pod were effective against severe negative effects of liver, blood, heart, lungs, cold, and other adverse health diseases (Table 9  ). In the treatment of hypertension, diabetes, skin cancer, and stress Moringa is found effective [23 ], alongside the capacity to combat malnutrition, moringa integration in the existing agroforestry can add medicinal, food, and nutritional benefits [24 ].  3.4.5  Gender equality:  Descalation of gender discrepancy in terms of production activities As shown in Fig. 5  , family members of respective homesteads were involved in Moringa-based homestead production activities. The participation in homestead farming activities revealed that male participation was higher for bed preparation (58.83 %), stalking (63.16 %), protection measures (52.63 %), harvesting (71.43 %), and marketing (62.5 %). Meanwhile, female participation was dominant for planting (54.55 %), weeding (52.38 %), irrigation (53.85 %), and fencing (52.94 %) activities. Both male and female members were equally involved in mulching (50 %). The child members of the family were rarely involved, and their participation was evident in bed preparation (11.76 %), planting (9.09 %), and irrigation (7.69 %). The production system can be recognized as an influential sector as there is satisfactory participation of women in homestead farming activities. The study revealed that farmers have a high preference for Moringa-based homesteads, and their enthusiasm towards natural farming that is less labor intensive requiring less mechanization. The support of women for conventional methods of growing vegetables on homesteads is quite visible [25 ]. By using their native management techniques in Sylhet in their respective home gardens, demonstrating the likelihood of inequality reduction by maintaining their accessibility (Rahman et al., 2010). In improving livelihood standards, women were found to possess favorable attitudes toward homestead farming [25 ]. A study conducted on Moringa species demonstration was mainly contributed by Women [26 ].  3.4.6  Affordable and clean energy:  own source of fuel The study revealed that 40 % of homesteads derived their fuel from Moringa-based homestead localities such as homestead trees, pruning materials, dried leaves, cowdung etc. (Fig. 6  ). Meanwhile, 32.50 % of respondents managed their fuel resources from outside the homestead area, such as nearby homesteads, forest areas, tea gardens, gas, or buying fuel. Only 27.50 % of homesteads used homesteads and outside resources for fuel energy. The diversity existing in the homesteads acts as a good source of fuel deriving from wood, dried leaves and members particularly females collect those sources to support their need for fuel wood [27 ].  3.4.7 Decent work and economic growth: on-farm and off-farm income opportunity Farmers derive income opportunities throughout the year, where major benefits were derived from the diversified farming opportunities existing in Moringa-based homesteads (Table 10  ). 96 % of farmers were involved in poultry farming as the livestock had great potential mainly the eggs which generate income from selling to neighbors and local markets. Meanwhile, fruit and vegetable farming also generated income opportunities for the farmers as seasonal demand increased and brought profitability to the producers of 92 % and 95 % respectively. Besides the on-farm income opportunity, the ability of off-farm production also accelerated when farmers engaged in working as day laborers (97 %) at the nearby tea gardens and working as vehicle drivers. Farmers opined that Moringa plants were among the vegetable, and fruit species that contribute to a significant proportion of their household income.  3.4.8  Life on land:  ecosystem health maintenance by resilient practices Farmers were found to contribute to maintaining ecosystem health by adopting climate-smart practices (Fig. 7  ). Among the identified Moringa-based homestead practices the practices such as following homestead agroforestry (100 %), rainwater harvesting (99 %), weeding (98 %), and management of debris (95 %), minimum tillage (94 %), IPM (92 %), mulching (91 %), planting quality variety (80 %), organic fertilizer application (84 %) were identified as major climate-smart practices which contribute to plant, soil and water management. the adoption of climate-smart practices in the existing farming system is responsible for natural resource conservation, and acceleration of productivity (Ruba et al., 2024). Such practices of homestead agroforestry facilitated farmers with the integration of a wider range of species, enhancing biodiversity conservation alongside food security capacity. Besides, rainwater harvesting was practiced as a resilient approach to use water according to their need as the water source of tube wells and ponds was located at the distance.  3.4.9 Motivational and demotivational factors Respondents identified seven motivational and six demotivational factors encountered during Moringa-based homestead adoption presented in Fig. 8  . Farmers ranked food security capacity as a major motivational factor of Moringa-based homestead adoption. Meanwhile, the second position ranked by the factor of high commercial value. Other motivational factors identified were high medicinal value, high nutrition, environmentally friendly, and easy to cultivate. Farmers ranked low economic return as a major demotivational factor, followed by minimized area, lack of credit, lack of interest and institutional support, knowledge gap, and managerial issues, respectively. Farmers revealed that lower economic returns from Moringa-based homesteads often restrict their enthusiasm toward large-scale production. Because the small piece of land or minimized limits their ability for large-scale production. Farmers expressed that shortage of credit is the reason that limits their buying capability of planting resources such as seed, seedlings, instruments, fertilizers, pesticides, etc. In this case, institutional support from government and non-government organizations can help them uplift their interest by giving information facilities and credit facilities. Such organizational help can improve their knowledge level and management of production issues [28 ]. The diversification of plant species is positively impacted by improvements in socioeconomic characteristics such as annual income, farm size, and knowledge; therefore, they should be given priority [29 ], that trigger to generate high returns on investment and financial security, and intensive production facilities facilitating farmers’ engagement in Moringa-based homestead farming. Since most farmers were only expected to have a basic education, it was necessary to improve farmer education while the forest policy was being implemented. This can shrink farmers' knowledge gap towards Moringa-based homestead farming and improve modern agroforestry practices by appropriate adoption. As a result, Moringa-based homestead can act as a two-way channel towards Sustainable Development Goals through its direct and indirect influence, where the indirect effect can be reflected after the management of drawbacks picturized in Fig. 9  . Major restraints that may be improved by institutional assistance, financial support, technology improvement, and management plans include a lack of technical expertise, land area, funds, and awareness [30 ]. There remains an enormous chance for improving homestead output by enriching their knowledge and abilities, which broadens the scope of enhanced management methods. The farmers should be encouraged towards homestead farming, and credit should be provided to strengthen this sector. In Jaintiapur, the marketing channel needs to be improved [20 ] for better reach among the consumers and to uplift the commercial value of the Moringa-based homesteads produce. The overall SWOT analysis “(Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)” is presented in Fig. 10  . The repeated flash floods in Sylhet require urgency to implement the project on a wider homestead-based farming system adoption that is both easily acceptable by the farmers and profit-driven. The monocropping and non-farm producers should be encouraged to adopt Moringa-based homesteads through institutional support and transparent marketing channels, which would help boost the economy of the producers through appropriate utilization of minimized areas following climate-smart practices. Further research should be conducted in Sylhet to identify sustainable moringa-based homestead farming systems.    4 Conclusion Homestead agroforestry is one of the influential systems that play a vital role in the life of the rural population. The positive scope of Moringa-based homestead is reflected among the adopters of the Nijpat union. Moringa-based homestead is practiced at Jaintiapur of Sylhet Upazila and among the adopters it satisfactorily provides plenty of benefits through its diverse opportunities in the cases of escalation of household income, access to food, nutrition, and medicinal resources, facilitation of natural treatment from diseases, de-escalation of gender discrepancy in terms of production activities, own source of fuel, on-farm and off-farm income opportunity, ecosystem health maintenance by resilient practices. Therefore, this homestead farming can add value in achieving Sustainable Development Goals of no poverty, zero hunger, good health and well-being, gender equality, affordable and clean energy, life on land, decent work, and economic growth. Hence, managing the prevailing drawbacks and shifting this homestead farming towards a high-value-based farming system is required. In this case, strategic approaches must be implemented to minimize the drawbacks of low economic return, minimized area, credit support, and institutional support. In this case, institutional support, credit facilities, and eliminating managerial issues should be considered while encouraging non-adopters or monocropping followers to make homestead production profitable by utilizing minimized areas. Therefore, the potentiality of a Moringa-based homestead should be explored following further research and it is recommended to sustainably utilize the existing Moringa-based homestead resources.
