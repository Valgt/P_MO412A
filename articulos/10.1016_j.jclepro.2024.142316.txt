                  Under the dual carbon target, governments globally have recognized the importance of exploring the relationship between the digital economy and low-carbon city (LCC) performance for achieving sustainable development. However, existing studies primarily focus on a single carbon emission index to reflect LCC performance while neglecting multidimensional outputs. This study aims to analyze how the digital economy drives LCC performance from a multidimensional output perspective. Based on 271 Chinese cities from 2006 to 2020, this study establishes a comprehensive digital economy index, and a multidimensional output index of LCC performance, then analyzes digital economy's impact on LCC performance through fixed effects and intermediary effects models. The findings indicate that: (1) Nationally, the digital economy has the potential to significantly decrease both overall and intensity of carbon emissions while increasing LCC efficiency. (2) Digital economy influences LCC development through innovation in green technology indirectly. (3) The digital economy's effects on LCC exhibits heterogeneity depending on city location, city size and city type. Specifically, it shows a greater effect on the decrease of carbon emissions in the eastern and central regions, exerts a bigger impact on small and medium-sized cities based on city size, and demonstrates a more substantial effect in resource-based cities. This study offers a thorough analysis of how the digital economy affects LCC performance, thereby providing empirical support for leveraging the digital economy's potential to foster urban low-carbon development.

Zhengzhou University Zhongyuan District Zhengzhou Henan China       Handling Editor: Zhifu Mi Under the dual carbon target, governments globally have recognized the importance of exploring the relationship between the digital economy and low-carbon city (LCC) performance for achieving sustainable development. However, existing studies primarily focus on a single carbon emission index to reflect LCC performance while neglecting multidimensional outputs. This study aims to analyze how the digital economy drives LCC performance from a multidimensional output perspective. Based on 271 Chinese cities from 2006 to 2020, this study establishes a comprehensive digital economy index, and a multidimensional output index of LCC performance, then analyzes digital economy's impact on LCC performance through fixed effects and intermediary effects models. The findings indicate that: (1) Nationally, the digital economy has the potential to significantly decrease both overall and intensity of carbon emissions while increasing LCC efficiency. (2) Digital economy influences LCC development through innovation in green technology indirectly. (3) The digital economy's effects on LCC exhibits heterogeneity depending on city location, city size and city type. Specifically, it shows a greater effect on the decrease of carbon emissions in the eastern and central regions, exerts a bigger impact on small and medium-sized cities based on city size, and demonstrates a more substantial effect in resource-based cities. This study offers a thorough analysis of how the digital economy affects LCC performance, thereby providing empirical support for leveraging the digital economy's potential to foster urban low-carbon development.

This phenomenon poses a significant threat to global sustainable development (Shan et al., 2018 ). According to the Climate Watch platform developed by the World Resources Institute, global carbon emissions reached 36.8 billion tons in 2019, representing a growth of over 62% compared to the level of 22.7 billion tons recorded in 1990. By midcentury, net-zero carbon emissions were to be achieved while keeping global warming to 1.5 °C, according to the United Nations Climate Change Conference held in November 2021. Decoupling carbon emissions from economic growth is a crucial issue for all countries worldwide to attain carbon-neutrality (Wang et al., 2019 ; Wang and Han, 2021 ). The global community will remain committed to long-term low-carbon development and the ongoing reduction of carbon emissions for many years ahead. China accounted nearly for 29% of global carbon emissions in 2020, and it has been the country with the fastest-growing energy consumption in the world for the past 19 years (Cao et al., 2021 ). As a responsible major country, a variety of emission reduction objectives have been established by the Chinese government in response to climate change. Durning the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in 2020, China's central government proposed to reach carbon peaking by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060 (“dual carbon” goal) (Du et al., 2023b ). It is acknowledged that cities are the main causes of the urgent problem of climate change (GEA, 2012 ). About 75%–80% of carbon emissions worldwide are produced by cities, with over 80% of carbon emissions in China coming from these areas (Shan et al., 2017 ; Su et al., 2020 ). Low carbon city (LCC) policies have been adopted by both the central and local governments in China to meet the urban carbon reduction targets in the country. For example, the National Development and Reform Commission of China established 81 low-carbon pilot cities in three batches respectively in 2010, 2012 and 2017 (Du et al., 2023a ). According to China Urban Statistical Yearbook, the total GDP of the 81 low-carbon pilot cities reached 51.83 trillion yuan in 2017, accounting for 62.66% of the China's total GDP. Local governments actively promoted LCC policy experiments with an open-minded approach as they explored pathways towards sustainable development (Song et al., 2020 ). The implementation of LCC practices is being explored by various cities from diverse perspectives. For example, Nanchang has explored LCC practice in the areas of energy, transportation, building, and citizen life. For another example, Shenzhen government has implemented carbon emission trading management measures, actively promotes new energy vehicles and builds charging piles, accelerates the promotion of prefabricated construction. The study of Du et al. (2022)  categorized LCC practice into five dimensions, namely industrial structure, energy structure, energy efficiency, carbon sink and low carbon management mechanism. The implementation of LCC pilot has a positive impact on LCC performance in China, the LCC performance of cities in southern China surpasses that of cities in northern China (Shen et al., 2021 ). Therefore, LCC practice serves as an embodiment of China's concerted efforts towards urban emission reduction, and is a pivotal strategy in addressing global emission mitigation challenge. China has emerged as a pioneer and leader in innovation and green modernization throughout the fourth Industrial Revolution (Yang et al., 2023 ). The advent of the technological revolution driven by digital technologies, presents an unparalleled opportunity for the government of China to fulfill its goal of achieving high-quality and low-carbon development (Yang et al., 2023 ). According to the outline of the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021–2025) for National Economic and Social Development in China, digitalization is a key strategy for optimizing and upgrading the economic system in China (Wang et al., 2022a ). According to the China Digital Economy Development Report (2022) released by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, China's digital economy accounted for 39.8% of GDP, amounting to 45.5 trillion yuan in 2021, with an annual nominal growth rate of 16.2%. This unequivocally demonstrates that the digital economy holds a steadfast position while playing a more prominent role in bolstering the national economy. Digitizing economic activities is regarded as a contemporary strategy to harness cutting-edge technologies towards achieving low-carbon growth in China (Li et al., 2021 ). Numerous academics have examined the connection between digital economy growth and carbon emissions from a variety of angles. From the standpoint of how the digital economy affects carbon emissions, several researchers analyzed the connection within the two factors. For example, Wang et al. (2022a , 2023 ) provided evidence of the detrimental impact of the digital economy on overall carbon emissions. Lee and Wang (2022) , and Wang and Zhong (2023)  analyzed how the digital economy affects carbon emission intensity and disclosed that it could both lower carbon emission intensity and have a regional spillover effect. From an efficiency standpoint, some academics have examined the relationship between energy or carbon emission efficiency and the digital economy. For instance, Zhang et al. (2022c)  discovered that the digital economy's growth increases carbon dioxide emissions, additionally, when considering energy efficiency as a mediating factor, the digital economy's impact shows a notable dual threshold effect on carbon emissions. Hao et al. (2023)  discovered that China's manufacturing green total factor productivity (GTFP) may be greatly increased by the digital economy. Xie et al. (2022)  claimed that areas with advanced digital economies often accompanied by higher carbon emission efficiency, and China's industrial sector needs to adopt a digital economy to reduce emissions and increase energy efficiency. It can be seen that previous research has predominantly employed a single index to assess digital economy's effect on carbon emissions, while ignoring multidimensional outputs. However, LCC practice is a comprehensive systematic project with multiple dimensions. As opined by Du et al. (2023a) , Chinese cities have implemented LCC from multiple dimensions, such as carbon sink improvement, low-carbon energy system development, industrial structure optimization, and low-carbon industrial system promotion. However, total carbon emissions can only reflect overall LCC performance, and carbon emission intensity shows the relative performance between carbon emissions and economic development. Therefore, this research will examine multidimensional output metrics such as total carbon emissions, carbon emission intensity, and LCC efficiency for more thoroughly assessing the digital economy's effect on LCC performance. Particularly, by taking into account both the overall and dimensional aims of LCC, the LCC efficiency index will provide insights into the input and output effects of implementing LCC practices (Du et al., 2023a ). Theoretically, this study enriches the research on digital economy and LCC by analyzing how digital economy drives LCC performance with a focus on multidimensional output. Practically, this study examines the diverse effects that how digital economy affects urban carbon emissions, providing valuable insights for national and local governments in formulating focused strategies to reduce emissions in urban areas. The rest of this article is set up as follows. Section 2  provides a literature review. Theoretical analysis and hypotheses are presented in Section 3 . Section 4  outlines the research design, followed by a case study in Section 5 . Section 6 and 7  shows the discussion and conclusions of this research.  2 Literature review In line with the research aims of this study, existing research on the overview of digital economy and the nexus between digital economy and LCC performance will be reviewed in this section. 2.1 Overview of digital economy Several academics have focused on the definition of the digital economy. For instance, the digital economy is considered to be an emerging economic structure that embodies Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in terms of production and lifestyle (Wang et al., 2022a ). The Group of 20 Digital Economy Development and Cooperation Initiative (2016) provides the following definition: The phrase “digital economy” describes a range of economic endeavors that leverage contemporary information networks as important conduits, digital knowledge and information as critical production inputs, and the efficient use of ICT as key enablers for optimizing the structure of the economy. Scholars also evaluated the performance of digital economy from several angles. For example, Zhang et al. (2022c)  developed an evaluation indicator system from the standpoint of industrial digitalization and digital industrialization, and employed the entropy technique to measure the development of the digital economy in 30 Chinese provinces between 2012 and 2019. Han et al. (2022)  constructed a measurement system that encompasses the establishment of digital infrastructure, the economic environment for digitalization, and the progress in digital industry. Ma et al. (2022)  developed an extensive digital economy index comprising of four indicators: annual revenue of telecommunications businesses, valuation of computer services and software industries for information transmission, the number of mobile phone users in each province, and the rate at which the province's population uses Internet broadband. Zhao et al. (2020)  devised a metric system for evaluating the extent of progress in the digital economy, encompassing Internet growth and inclusion in digital financial services.  2.2 Research on the correlation between the digital economy and LCC performance The digital economy's environmental impact has been the subject of increasing research as academics throughout the world concentrate more on concerns related to sustainable development and climate change (Wang et al., 2022b ). By facilitating effective resource allocation and interdepartmental sharing of environmental information, digital technology significantly enhances decision-making in environmental risk management, thereby promoting low-carbon sustainable development in urban areas (Bakker and Ritts, 2018 ). Consequently, research on the connection between LCC performance and the digital economy is expanding. For example, the association between digital financial inclusion and carbon emissions (Lee and Wang, 2022 ; Zheng and Li, 2022 ), as well as the correlation between digital technologies and carbon emissions (Liu et al., 2022 ; Wang et al., 2023 ), and the relationship between smart cities and energy preservation and reduction in emissions (Cheng et al., 2022 ; Guo et al., 2022 ). Current researches mostly studied how the digital economy affects carbon emissions from a provincial perspective. For instance, Ma et al. (2022)  discovered that digital economy successfully decreased carbon emissions at the provincial level using annual data from 30 Chinese provinces spanning 2006 to 2017. Zhang et al. (2022c)  used 30 Chinese provinces' panel data between 2012 and 2019 to empirically investigate the correlation among the digital economy, energy efficiency, and carbon emissions. The findings showed that carbon emissions increased in China as the country's digital economy grew, and that energy efficiency was a regulating factor in this relationship. Wang and Zhong (2023)  analyzed urban panel data samples spanning from 2000 to 2019, and utilized the Difference-in-Differences model to explore what extent could digital economy decrease carbon emission intensity. The findings indicated a positive correlation between these two factors. There are also individual studies that focus on how digital economy affects carbon emissions at city level. For instance, Liu et al. (2023)  examined how digital economy affected 286 Chinese cities' urban GTFP between 2011 and 2019. This study concluded that digital economy effectively improved urban GTFP, and contributed to urban sustainable development. According to Dong et al. (2023) , e-commerce is considered as digital economy's primary driver. The study employed a quasi-natural experiment methodology to investigate the fluctuations in carbon emissions across 270 Chinese cities from 2004 to 2017, revealing that the implementation of pilot policies in national e-commerce demonstration cities resulted in a notable reduction of carbon emissions by 4.1%. After conducting a comprehensive literature review, the innovation of this study primarily lies in research object and perspective. In terms of research objects, existing studies predominantly focus on examining the impact of digital economy on carbon emissions at the provincial level. However, considering that cities play a crucial role in carbon emissions and serve as the basic unit for urban policy implementation and decision-making in China (Du et al., 2023a ), it is imperative to pay attention to the study from city level. From a research perspective, although some studies attempt to analyze the relationship between digital economy and LCC performance, scholars have only concentrated on either carbon emission intensity or total carbon emissions from a singular viewpoint. Nevertheless, LCC practices encompass multiple dimensions within a comprehensive systematic project. The role of digital economy in promoting LCC performance can be disclosed more clearly through multi-dimensional outputs. Therefore, by examining multidimensional output, namely, total carbon emissions, carbon emission intensity, and LCC efficiency, this study aims to provide cleaner insights into how the digital economy promotes LCC performance.   3 Theoretical analysis and hypothesis The essence of urban sustainable development theory emphasizes on the sustainable development of society, economy, and environment. This study evaluates low carbon performance from a multidimensional output perspective, including carbon emissions, carbon emission intensity, and LCC efficiency. These indicators manifest the sustainability of the aforementioned dimensions. To be more specific, carbon emission reflects environmental sustainability, carbon emission intensity represents both economic and environmental sustainability, while LCC efficiency signifies a balance among society, economy, and environment. Therefore, the investigation of how the digital economy drives LCC performance across multi dimensions can unveil the relationship between the digital economy and the sustainable development of society, economy, and environment, thereby contributing to the pursuit of urban sustainability. The digital economy's impact on LCC performance can be analyzed in terms of both direct and indirect effects. 3.1 Direct impact The rapid advancement of ICT has propelled the digital economy to enhance both economic and environmental benefits. The digital economy will bolster the LCC performance by curbing carbon emissions, reducing carbon intensity and improving LCC efficiency. Firstly, digital technology provides an information technology platform for environmental protection (Granell et al., 2016 ). The integration of artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and other related technologies has the potential to optimize the cost-effectiveness of environmental development. Simultaneously, it can facilitate seamless interconnectivity between environmental technology and mainstream communication technology, thereby providing indispensable technical support for dynamic monitoring of environmental quality by governmental authorities. Secondly, the digital economy enhances resource allocation efficiency. When data, information and other elements are linked with traditional elements, the productivity and allocation efficiency of these elements are significantly boosted (Zhai et al., 2022 ). Digital economy's advancement lowers the cost of transactions and information, promotes regional industrial upgrading, and increases the carbon emissions efficiency (Lin and Chen, 2018 ). Finally, the advantages and features of the digital economy, such as information sharing and the impact of space-time transmission, can reduce non-essential activities leading to effective carbon reduction. Thus, this study put out Hypothesis 1 : The digital economy may directly mitigate overall carbon emissions, curb carbon emission intensity, and enhance LCC efficiency, thereby enhancing LCC performance.  3.2 Indirect impact 3.2.1 Green technology innovation Urban carbon emissions have decreased dramatically as a result of green innovation (Yuan et al., 2022 ). According to Li et al. (2022) , the expansion of digital economy can spur technical innovation. Firstly, digital technology's fairness and real-time interactivity help to address information asymmetry and lower information search costs (Chung, 2018 ). This facilitates cross-regional flow of innovation elements and enhances knowledge spillover, thereby promoting exchange of innovation resources. Furthermore, within the realm of dual carbon, there is a growing trend towards stricter environmental regulations and an increasing demand for both green consumption and green supply. This encourages enterprises to actively engage in development on green technologies, then produce green and low-carbon products that achieving emission reductions and energy savings.  3.2.2 Industrial structure The industrial structure has been impacted by the digital economy in the ways that follow. Firstly, digital technology provides technical support and platforms for the transformation of traditional industries. By integrating technologies such as the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence with traditional industries, it enables a more digitized and technology-intensive industry, thereby reshaping the structure of industry and mitigating carbon emissions (Ren et al., 2021 ). Secondly, the digital economy helps to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by enhancing the value added of the tertiary sector. It also falls under the high-tech service industry, which is environmentally friendly and ensures economic progress when compared to manufacturing industries of similar size (Wang et al., 2022a ).  3.2.3 Environmental regulation According to Habiba et al. (2022) , increasing the severity of environmental regulations has the potential to lower carbon emissions, effectively moderate the overall carbon emissions of businesses, and aid in the attainment of sustainable development goals. On the one hand, remote sensing technology, along with other digital technologies can facilitate real-time dynamic monitoring and early warning of carbon emissions within a jurisdiction, thereby improving the accuracy of government supervision (Huo and Zhang, 2022 ). On the other hand, increasing the level of environmental regulation can encourage businesses to innovate through technology, make it easier for smart businesses to be established, and help reduce carbon emissions in the region.  3.2.4 Low-carbon lifestyle Digital economy emphasizes green development and pays attention to environmental protection. Moreover, the space overflow of environmental protection knowledge helps to enhance all residents’ environmental awareness, thereby facilitating green, low-carbon, healthy, and civilized behaviors among residents during travel and consumption (Wang and Zhong, 2023 ). Bin and Dowlatabadi (2005)  introduced a consumer lifestyle approach to examine the correlation between consumer activity and environmental impact within the United States, and revealing that over 80% of energy use in the country are the result of consumer demand and the economic activities that support these needs.  3.2.5 Energy structure Due to its ability to decrease reliance on coal consumption structure, the digital economy negatively affects carbon emissions (Wang et al., 2022a ). Energy management is significantly impacted by the digital economy. Firstly, by using digital platforms, proactive monitoring of energy data is made possible, improving energy efficiency and making the gradual switch to clean energy sources easier (Lange et al., 2020 ). Secondly, by advancing renewable energy technologies and reducing costs, the digital economy expands the range of clean energy applications while facilitating the shift from fossil fuels to renewable sources (Zheng and Wang, 2021 ).  3.2.6 Carbon sink In addition to mitigating carbon sources, improving cities' ability to sequester carbon is another crucial strategy to reduce carbon emissions. China's forest resources are sequestering more carbon dioxide on a physical basis, and the rate of contribution is rising annually (Shi et al., 2022 ). Digital technology platforms can provide dynamic monitoring of carbon sequestration processes. Furthermore, digital enterprises actively participate in the establishment of carbon sinks in forests. The Accounting Report of Ant Forest 2016–2020 Gross Ecosystem Product (GEP), jointly released by the Research Center for Ecological Environment at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the International Union for Conservation of Nature, reveals that over the period from 2016 to 2020, a total area exceeding 3.06 million mu was afforested with more than 223 million real trees in ant forests, resulting in a reduction of carbon emissions surpassing 12 million tons. LCC practice should enhance the carbon sequestration function within urban green spaces as it not only fosters low-carbon economic progress but also enhances residents' quality of life (Qiu et al., 2021 ). Thus, this paper put out Hypothesis 2: The digital economy can mitigate carbon emissions and enhance LCC performance through the encouragement of green technology innovation, adjustment of industrial structure, enhancement of environmental regulation intensity, cultivation of a low-carbon lifestyle, improvement of energy composition optimization, and augmentation of carbon sinks.Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 2 can be presented in Fig. 1  .      4 Research design 4.1 Research model The fixed effect model effectively addresses the endogenous issues arising from omitted variables. According to Yang et al. (2023) , the following fixed-effect baseline regression model is constructed to verify hypothesis 1  in the case of direct transmission.(1) Y i t   = α 0  + α 1  D i g  i t   + β X i t   + μ i  + δ t  + ε i t            Where, i  and t  respectively stand for city i  and year t . Y  denotes the dependent variable. α 0     indicates a constant term, α 1     represents digital economy's estimated parameter. D i g  i t      is the key explanatory variable, indicates the digital economy development index of the city i  during period t. X i t      is the control variables that affect low carbon city performance. μ i     represents the fixed effect of city, δ t     denotes the fixed effect of time, ε i t      refers the random error term. In addition to direct effects, in order to discuss the possible indirect mechanism of digital economy on LCC performance, a mediation effect model was constructed for research hypothesis 2. The specific steps are as follows: On the premise that α1  is significant, then the regression equation (2)  of digital economy for intermediary variables and the regression equation (3)  of digital economy and intermediary variables for LCC performance are constructed respectively. Referring to Wang et al. (2022c) , the details are as follows.(2) M i t   = b 0  + b 1  D i g  i t   + b X i t   + μ i  + δ t  + ε i t           (3) Y i t   = c 0  + c 1  D i g  i t   + c 2  M i t   + c X i t   + μ i  + δ t  + ε i t            Where M i t      is the mediating variable, including green technological innovation, industrial structure, environmental regulation low-carbon lifestyle, energy structure and carbon sink. If the significance of coefficient b 1     in Eq. (2)  and c 2     in Eq. (3)  remains unchanged, while the importance and absolute value of c 1     in Eq. (3)  decline notably relative to that of α 1     in Eq. (1) , it can be inferred that variable M i t      mediates the relationship between digital economy and LCC performance.  4.2 Dependent variable The multidimensional output indexes of LCC performance used in this study encompass total carbon emissions (CE), carbon emission intensity (CI), and low carbon city efficiency (LCCE). Previous research has consistently employed indicators such as carbon emissions, per capita carbon emission, carbon emission intensity, and LCC efficiency for evaluating LCC performance (Zhang et al., 2022c ; Wang et al., 2023 ; Guo et al., 2022 ; Liu et al., 2022 ; Huo and Zhang, 2022 ; Xu et al., 2022 ; Du et al., 2023a ). In this study, the impact of digital economy index on these four indicators was calculated. However, it was observed that per capita carbon emission yields similar results to carbon emissions. Consequently, the aforementioned three indexes were ultimately selected for measuring LCC performance.(1) Total carbon emissions (CE)    The methodology proposed by Zhang et al. (2022b)  enables the calculation of the overall carbon emission by applying a logarithmic function to the city's carbon emissions. Specifically, the carbon emissions resulting from the utilization of natural gas (N G a s   ), liquefied petroleum gas (L P G   ), and electricity (E l e c   ) as energy sources. Constructing the formula as follows:(4) C O  2  = σ 1  N G a s + σ  2  L P G + σ 3  ( k × E l e c  )           Where σ 1     represents N G a s    carbon emission factor, and its value is 2.1622 kg/m3 . σ 2     denotes L P G    carbon emission factor, with a value of 3.1013 kg/kg. σ 3     refers to the carbon emission factor of coal burning fuel, which is 1.3023 kg/kWh; k    serves as an indicator that quantifies the ratio between electricity generated from coal-fired sources and overall power production.(2) Carbon emission intensity (CI)    The calculation of carbon emission intensity entails determining the ratio between carbon emissions and GDP.(3) Low carbon city efficiency (LCCE)    The low carbon city efficiency was calculated by super-SBM model based on the study of Tone (2002) . According to Du et al. (2023a) , the specific measures of input and output variables of LCC practice are shown in Fig. 2  .  4.3 Control variable The LCC performance can be affected by the digital economy, as well as many control variables. To mitigate potential estimation bias and ensure comprehensive analysis, control variables were added to the fixed model. Various studies have employed different indicators as control variables, as shown in Table A1 of Appendix, which shows the factors that significantly impact carbon emissions and occur with a high frequency. As a result, six factors are selected, including Economic Development (ED), Population Size (PS), Science and Technology (ST), Financial Development (FD), Human Capital (HC) and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).(1) Economic Development (ED). Economic development and people's living standards are closely linked, with higher living standards often indicating greater awareness of low carbon (Zhang et al., 2022c ). This study employs per capita income (the logarithm of per capita GDP (C1 )) to gauge economic advancement.  (2) Population Size (PS). Urban population density can have two effects. Firstly, it can result in increased overall energy consumption and carbon emissions. Secondly, it can enhance carbon emission efficiency due to the population agglomeration effect (Wang and Zhong, 2023 ). Also, Population significantly affects the timing of peak carbon emissions (Huo et al., 2023 ). Population density (C2 ), which is the logarithm of the entire urban population divided by the area of the urban administrative district, is used in this study to calculate the size of the population.  (3) Science and Technology (ST). Investing more in scientific and technological research can help urban entities become more innovative, which will increase the efficiency of cities in terms of carbon emissions (Fu et al., 2021 ). Science and technology in this study is determined by dividing expenditures on science and technology by GDP (C3 ).  (4) Financial Development (FD). Firstly, by encouraging the promotion of green technologies and the upgrading of industrial structures, financial development can lower prices. Secondly, by boosting economic expansion and energy consumption, particularly that of fossil fuels, it can also increase carbon emissions (Xu et al., 2021 ). Loans made to financial institutions as a percentage of GDP are used to measure financial development (C4 ).  (5) Human Capital (HC). The increase in the educational population within the city signifies its capacity for talent cultivation and civilization, fostering awareness of low-carbon concepts and behaviors while contributing to the accumulation of human capital. This variable is expected to enable carbon reduction through technology spillover effects because human capital is the carrier of technology and directly influences innovation (Zhou and Du, 2021 ). The percentage of college and university students in relation to the total population is used in this study to calculate HC (C5 ).  (6) Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). On the one hand, FDI can mitigate pollution in host countries through the spillover effect of green technologies. On the other hand, by enabling the transfer of polluting sectors, FDI may worsen the environmental governance of host nations (Zhang et al., 2022a ). In this study, this variable is represented by the actual FDI to GDP ratio (C6 ).     4.4 Mediating variable Similarly, Table A2 of Appendix shows mediating variables used in the previous literature. According to Table A2, the most frequent are Green Technology Innovation (GTI), Industrial Structure (IS), Environmental Regulation (ER), Low-carbon Lifestyle (LCL), and Energy Structure (ES), these five variables are selected as mediating variables. Besides these five factors, Carbon Sink (CS) is also considered as an important dimension in LCC practice (Du et al., 2021 ). Therefore, the carbon sink is selected as a mediating variable in this study.(1) Green Technological Innovation (GTI). Innovation serves as a potent catalyst for high-quality development (Zhao et al., 2020 ), and GTI has a more direct effect on the quality of urban economic development. Referring to the study of Ley et al. (2016) , per capita green patent applications (M1 ) are adopted to represent GTI. The State Intellectual Property Office of China calculated the overall number of green patent applications filed each year by region using the Green Technology list released by WIPO. The total number of applications was divided by the population of the region to obtain M1 .  (2) Industrial Structure (IS). The more rational the industrial structure, the more it can weaken carbon emissions theoretically (Mi et al., 2015 ). The industrial structure coefficient (M2 ) is applied to expressed industrial structure performance, which can be obtained by the following Equation (Guo et al., 2022 ).   (5) M 2  = S 1  × 1 + S  2  × 2 + S  3  × 3          Where, S 1  , S 2   and S 3   represent the first, second, and third industries' respective share of the regional GDP by production value.(3) Environmental Regulation (ER). Environmental regulations will diminish economic output and carbon emissions in the short term, but they will have a long-term positive impact on lowering carbon intensity (Zhong et al., 2021 ). Utilizing the ratio of environmental vocabulary word frequency to prefecture-level city government work report word frequency (M3 ) as a means of quantifying environmental regulation.  (4) Low-carbon Lifestyle (LCL). With economic development and social progress, people's low-carbon awareness is becoming increasingly strong. Regarding Wang et al. (2022d) , the number of public (electric) vehicles per 10,000 people (M4 ) is used as a proxy for an urban low-carbon lifestyle.  (5) Energy Structure (ES). Energy consumption structure and carbon emissions are connected because different forms of energy have significantly varied carbon contents (Pata, 2018 ). Referring to Zhang et al. (2022c) , the energy consumption structure is represented through the utilization of the percentage of coal consumption in relation to overall energy consumption (M5).  (6) Carbon Sink (CS). The important measures to reduce carbon emissions are not only to reduce carbon sources, but also to improve the carbon sequestration capacity of cities. Urban carbon sequestration is enhanced by green space, which includes grasslands, woods, and shrubs (Qiu et al., 2021 ). Referring to Qiu et al. (2021) , carbon sink is represented by the green coverage rate of completed area (M6 ). The greater the index, the stronger the carbon sink.     4.5 Independent variable The independent variable is the comprehensive index of the Digital Economy Development (DED). The DED comprehensive index and evaluation method refer to a seminal study on digital economy conducted by Ma et al. (2022)  and published on a high-quality Journal ‘Technology in Society’ . The results have also been cited by other scholars, highlighting its significance in the field (Huang et al., 2023 ). In fact, the indicators used in this study align with most of previous studies on DED performance, for example, Zhao et al. (2020)  also selected these indicators to assess DED performance. Consequently, the indexes are selected for measuring DED performance, which are shown in Table 1  , and the indicators' measuring method and sources are shown in Table 2  .   5 Case study 5.1 Research data The sample size plays a crucial role when utilizing such models, as an inadequate sample size may introduce randomness. Therefore, it is imperative to carefully select an appropriate sample size to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the study. According to existing studies, Huo and Zhang (2022)  analyzed the impact of the digital economy on carbon emission intensity, the sample size is 2268 from 252 cities from 2011 to 2019, Dong et al. (2023)  used 3640 observed values for 270 cities from 2004 to 2017. In line with their studies, this research conducted a case study on 271 Chinese cities from 2006 to 2020, with 3978 samples, which is consistent with the existing research requirements. To mitigate the impact of price factors, variables related to prices are adjusted to the constant price in 2003. The descriptive statistics of major variables following data cleaning is presented in Table A3.  5.2 Benchmark regression estimation The baseline regression findings in Table 3   show how digital economy influences LCC performance, while controlling for various factors such as control variables, city fixed effects, and year fixed effects to address endogeneity concerns. Based on the data presented in column (1) and (2) of Table 3 , the digital economy's estimated coefficients on the overall carbon emission and urban carbon emission intensity are both negative and statistically notably respectively at the 1% and 5% levels. This suggests that, on a national scale, the digital economy has a substantial impact on lowering both overall and intensity of carbon emissions at the city level. There exists a positive association between digital economy and LCC efficiency, as shown by the estimated coefficient in column (3) of 0.030, which is statistically positive at the 5% level. To be more precise, with every 5% increase in the digital economy index, a city's LCC efficiency rises by 0.030 units. These findings provide empirical support for hypothesis 1 . In terms of control variables, economic development and population density exert a significant impact on carbon emissions and intensity. Specifically, as economic and population density improve in various regions, carbon emissions increase while carbon intensity decreases. The influence of science and technology expenditure on LCC efficiency is prominently demonstrated; namely, LCC efficiency increases with the augmentation of science and technology expenditure.  5.3 Robustness check To further validate the empirical results’ reliability, the following robust tests are carried out in this research. Firstly, truncation. Given the impact of the extreme value on the overall sample, this study excluded the value of carbon emission performance at the extreme 1%, and conducted a new estimation test, as indicated in columns (1)–(3) of Table 4  . The findings show that the digital economy inhibits the city's overall and intensity of carbon emissions, promotes LCC efficiency. The results align with the baseline regression analysis. Secondly, eliminate four municipalities. Given that the four municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing) have more intricate administrative structures than other prefecture-level cities, the results of the study may be affected. After excluding the four municipalities, columns (4)–(6) of Table 4  display the results, the estimated coefficients’ symbols of the digital economy are consistent with the benchmark analysis.  5.4 Mechanism analysis The regression analysis conducted in benchmark study reveals that the digital economy can mitigate both the overall amount and intensity of carbon emissions, while also enhancing LCC efficiency. So, what is the transmission mechanism? The mechanism is analyzed according to models (2) and (3), and the findings are displayed in Table 5  . Green technology innovation is the first mechanism variable. At the 5% significance level, the digital economy's estimated coefficient is 0.484 in Table 5 , column (1), indicating a sizable positive contribution. This implies that green innovation can be fostered by the digital economy. Upon incorporating green technology innovation into the data in column (2), the coefficient for the core explanatory variable becomes negative and relatively decreases, suggesting that enhanced green technology innovation in the digital economy could potentially contribute to lowering carbon emissions. Furthermore, when incorporating green technology innovation in column (4), it is evident that while maintaining a positive coefficient for the core explanatory variable, its value relatively decreases. This illustrates how advances in green technology might help the digital economy boost LCC efficiency. Surprisingly, based on the findings in column (1), although a positive impact, there is no statistical significance between the digital economy and industrial structure. This may be attributed to the rapid progress in digital technologies such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence, as well as the government's emphasis on promoting digital economy through policies, leading to increased investments across various industries, this promotes industrial structure adjustment and mitigates carbon emissions. However, these results are an ideal scenario. As for the results of this study, the industrial structure is slightly but favorably impacted by the digital economy. According to pertinent research, altering the industrial structure won't completely cut carbon emissions (Fu et al., 2021 ). The effectiveness of carbon reduction resulting from industrial restructuring may vary depending on regional economic and industrial structures, or the structural changes within the tertiary industry and manufacturing industry (Wang et al., 2022d ). The findings from Table 5  further demonstrate that although the digital economy has contributed to the intensity of environmental regulations and low-carbon travel, it has not yielded the anticipated reduction in emissions. Then there is the intermediary role of energy consumption. It is clear that the digital economy does not considerably reduce carbon emissions by optimizing energy consumption structure. Firstly, due to limitations in resource endowment, high-carbon energy continues to dominate the country's energy consumption structure, making it challenging to bring about immediate changes and resulting in a lack of noticeable carbon reduction effects (Yang et al., 2019 ). Secondly, increasing clean energy consumption as a means to improve the energy consumption structure incurs high costs for carbon reduction and imposes additional economic burdens, thereby impeding carbon reduction efforts (Lin, 2017 ). Lastly, the intermediary role of carbon sink is discussed. While the digital economy encourages carbon sinks, its effects are not immediately apparent. The analysis of the mechanism reveals that the adoption of green technology innovation in the digital economy can effectively mitigate carbon emissions and enhance LCC efficiency. Hypothesis 2 is partially validated.  5.5 Heterogeneity analysis Given the considerable variation in digital economy levels and carbon emission performance among cities, it is likely that there is heterogeneity in the relationship between the two. Based on three dimensions, urban geographical location, city size, and resource type, this study conducts heterogeneity analysis to offer a more precise understanding of the correlation between digital economy and LCC performance. Based on city location, Table 6   investigates the variations of the digital economy's impact on LCC performance. According to the regional classification standards set by the National Bureau of Statistics, cities are categorized into four regions: eastern, central, western, and northeast. As depicted in Table 6 , there exists regional differences regarding the influence between the digital economy and carbon emissions. For carbon emissions, digital economy can significantly reduce the cities in the eastern and central regions, and for carbon emission intensity, digital economy has the potential to significantly reduce the central regions. Furthermore, from the perspective of LCCE, digital economy can improve the central regions. This disparity may be explained by the relatively underdeveloped digital infrastructure and inadequate integration between the digital economy and green technology in the western and northeastern regions, urban carbon emissions are not sensitive to the digital economy. Based on city size, Table 7   examines the variations of the digital economy's effect on LCC performance. Referring to city size classification standards published by the State Council of the People's Republic of China, cities with a permanent urban population exceeding one million are classified as large cities, while the remaining are considered small and medium-sized cities. The findings in Table 7  indicates that, major cities experience minimal influence from the digital economy on LCC performance, although, the impact of digital economy on carbon emission intensity of small and medium-sized cities is not obvious, it exists a considerable positive influence on LCC efficiency and lowers carbon emissions in small and medium-sized cities. This observation could be explained by the fact that small and medium-sized cities are more receptive to digital technology since they consume less energy overall and emit less carbon emissions as a result (Huo and Zhang, 2022 ). Based on urban resource types, Table 8   examines the differences in the digital economy's effect on LCC performance. The National Sustainable Development Plan for Resource-Based Cities (2013–2020) divides prefecture-level cities into non-resource-based and resource-based groups. As depicted in Table 8 , the digital economy effectively reduces the overall intensity of carbon emissions in resource-based cities while improving LCC efficiency. However, its impact on LCC performance in non-resource-based cities is found to be not statistically significant. This could be because compared to non-resource-based cities, resource-based cities have slower ICT development, the advancement of digital technologies can foster green technology innovation and enhance energy utilization efficiency, thereby substantially reducing carbon emissions and improving LCC efficiency.   6 Discussion The digital economy, as a novel economic paradigm, has been extensively examined by scholars to understand its relationship with carbon emission reduction, leading to inconsistent findings. This study delves further into how the digital economy affects LCC performance. It is clear from the sample cities’ empirical study results that the digital economy is essential to mitigating carbon emissions in urban areas. This result matches up with the findings of Wang et al. (2022a) , which suggests an inverse correlation between the digital economy and carbon emissions, for every 1% increase in the digital economy index, there is an approximate reduction of 0.886% in carbon emissions. Moreover, the digital economy lowers the carbon emission intensity. Liu et al. (2022)  also believe that the advancement of digital technology not only reduces the intensity of local carbon emissions but also encourages adjacent cities to reduce their emissions as well. Finally, the digital economy enhances the LCC efficiency. According to Xie and Zhang (2022) , the digital economy holds immense promise in effectively mitigating carbon emissions. However, Zhang et al. (2022c)  have uncovered that the growth of the digital economy has exacerbated carbon dioxide emissions, while Avom et al. (2020)  have also asserted that the digital economy could potentially have adverse effects on environmental sustainability. The disparity in findings may be attributed to variations in sample composition and indicator selection. Most studies have examined the correlation between the digital economy and carbon emissions at a national or provincial level, focusing solely on single indicators. Therefore, it is imperative to analyze LCC performance from a multidimensional output perspective at the city level. These findings offer China a potential pathway towards achieving carbon neutrality and fostering sustainable development. This study uncovers that the digital economy primarily influences LCC performance by facilitating the advancement of green technology innovation, as evidenced by the results of the analysis of mediating effects. Green technology innovation, on the one hand, can mitigate carbon emissions by substituting low-carbon technologies for conventional ones. On the other hand, it can increase economic benefits by improving production efficiency and thereby improving LCC efficiency. According to Yang et al. (2023) , the integration of the digital economy with green technology innovation can enable low-carbon inclusive development. Additionally, Lee and Wang (2022)  also noted that digital financial inclusion can indirectly lower carbon intensity through the promotion of green technologies. According to the examination of urban location, size, and resource type, it is found that LCC performance is influenced differently by the digital economy. Firstly, during the sample period, there is no discernible influence of the digital economy on the reduction of carbon emissions in the western and northeastern regions, but there is a notable negative effect on LCC performance in cities located in the eastern and central regions. This discrepancy could be attributed to the relatively high Internet penetration rate and advanced digital infrastructure present in the eastern and central areas, enabling a stronger role for the digital economy in emissions reduction. In contrast to central and eastern China, despite benefiting from national policies such as “Western development”, the underdeveloped economy and backwardness of digital infrastructure prevent the digital economy from making a meaningful contribution to the reduction of carbon emissions. Secondly, the digital economy has no significant impact on the LCC performance of large cities, but it greatly lowers the carbon emission and improve LCC efficiency within small and medium-sized cities, Wang et al. (2022a)  and Xu et al. (2022)  have reached the same conclusion. On the one hand, according to Zhao et al. (2020) , the large cities' digital economy has benefited from an early release of carbon emission reductions, due to its earlier development and full application of advanced digital technologies like artificial intelligence and remote sensing in the fields of production and life. On the other hand, small cities exhibit lower levels of technological advancement and energy utilization efficiency. The adoption of digital technologies can drive high-tech innovation and enhance energy utilization efficiency, leading to significant reductions in carbon emissions and improved LCC efficiency. Finally, the digital economy does not have a discernible effect on non-resource-based cities' LCC performance, but it can considerably reduce resource-based cities' carbon emissions. In line with the research conducted by Fang et al. (2011) , there is no statistically significant inverse relationship between the quantity of natural resources and economic growth when measured using the per capita concept. Resource-based cities are slower compared to non-resource-based cities to establish digital infrastructure, but the emergence of digital technologies like big data can spur the creation of green technologies and efficient use of energy. Consequently, resource-based cities can break free from the “resource curse”, enhance LCC performance, and create new urban competitive advantages with the digital economy's help.  7 Conclusions and policy implications 7.1 Conclusions The research analyzes how digital economy drives low-carbon city performance from the view of multidimensional outputs such as carbon emissions, carbon emission intensity, and urban low carbon city efficiency. Based on 271 Chinese cities' panel data from 2006 to 2020, a digital economy comprehensive index is employed and a multidimensional output index for evaluating low-carbon city performance is established. Empirical analysis using fixed effects and intermediary effects models to examine the digital economy's effect on low-carbon city performance. The following are the conclusions: (1) At a national level, the digital economy drastically lowers both the overall and intensity of carbon emissions while improving low carbon city efficiency; (2) From a perspective of impact mechanism, the digital economy lowers carbon emissions and intensity while increasing low-carbon city efficiency indirectly through green technology innovation. (3) There is heterogeneity in the digital economy's effect on LCC. Given city location, its effect is greater in eastern and central regions. Regarding city size, it exerts a greater impact on small and medium-sized cities by significantly reducing their carbon emissions and improving their low carbon city efficiency. Lastly, with respect to city type, it demonstrates a more pronounced impact on low-carbon cities' performance in resource-based cities.  7.2 Policy implications Drawing from the research findings mentioned above, this study offers policy implications for enhancing low-carbon city performance in the digital economy. These recommendations focus on three aspects.(1) According to the overall findings, the digital economy can dramatically lower both total and intensity of urban carbon emissions while improving low-carbon city efficiency. Thus, it is essential to take the advantage of the digital economy and maximize its beneficial impacts on low carbon performance. Given the existing reality gap, the governments and enterprises should actively support the advancement of digital technology and carefully consider the cultivation of digital talents, so as to lay a solid foundation for achieving mutually beneficial economic growth and carbon emission reduction.  (2) The findings from mechanism analysis demonstrate a notable indirect effect of innovation in green technology. Therefore, the best method to fully utilize the digital economy to improve LCC performance is to foster innovation in green technology. Governments should strengthen policy guidance and support for green technology innovation, facilitate sustainable transformation in enterprises, and maximize the economic impact of such innovations.  (3) Based on the results of heterogeneity analysis, policymakers and urban planners should take a differentiated approach to advancing the digital economy. On the one hand, compared with large cities and non-resource-based cities, small and medium-sized cities as well as resource-based cities experience a more significant decrease in carbon emissions through the implementation of digital economy. Therefore, digital resources and infrastructure should be appropriately tilted to small and medium-sized cities and resource-based cities to drive their LCC performance. On the other hand, the impact of the digital economy on low-carbon development is not readily apparent in large cities and non-resource-dependent cities. These urban areas necessitate innovative approaches to low-carbon practices, including the establishment of carbon trading markets and the promotion of individual low-carbon behaviors.     7.3 Limitation and future study The study has several limitations. This research exclusively focuses on empirical analysis conducted in China, future studies may consider analyzing global cities from the perspective of various countries. Moreover, it is worth noting that the measurement of digital economy is still in its infancy, further research can enhance the measurement methods employed. Additionally, future studies can explore the impact path between digital economy and LCC performance from multiple perspectives.
