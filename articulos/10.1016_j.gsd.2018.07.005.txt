                  South Sudan, the world's newest nation is bestowed with huge fresh water resources. However, water resources management in South Sudan is lacking in water quality monitoring data and comprehensive plans of action for sustainable water resources development.
                  Groundwater resources in particular have been exploited for domestic and irrigation use versus surface water. However, this groundwater withdrawal has not been monitored for its level and quality. To overcome this deficit, groundwater major ion chemistry in the South Sudan's Eastern Equatoria State was evaluated to determine its suitability for drinking, domestic, and irrigation purposes. A total of 176 groundwater samples were collected during wet (October 2014) and dry (April 2014) seasons. Sampling points were spread around the eight counties of Eastern Equatoria. Twenty two water samples were collected from each county. The samples were analysed for various physicochemical parameters including alkalinity, calcium hardness, conductivity, pH, salinity, TDS, total hardness, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Ba2+, CrT, Cd2+, Cu2+, FeT, Ni2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, NO3
                     -, Cl-, F-, SO4
                     2-, PO4
                     3-, and SiO2. Groundwater irrigation quality indices including chlorinity index, Kelli Index, magnesium ratio, percentage of sodium must be replaced by sodium percentage (%Na), permeability index (PI), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), salinity index, sodicity index, and sodium absorption ratio (SAR), were calculated to determine the groundwater suitability for agricultural uses. The results were compared with South Sudan water quality guidelines (SSWQGs) and the WHO standards. Most of the water quality parameters met the WHO standards and SSWQGs prescribed for drinking and domestic purposes. The calculated irrigation water quality indices indicated the water suitability for irrigation.

School of Environmental Sciences Jawaharlal Nehru University New Delhi 110067 India       South Sudan, the world's newest nation is bestowed with huge fresh water resources. However, water resources management in South Sudan is lacking in water quality monitoring data and comprehensive plans of action for sustainable water resources development. Groundwater resources in particular have been exploited for domestic and irrigation use versus surface water. However, this groundwater withdrawal has not been monitored for its level and quality. To overcome this deficit, groundwater major ion chemistry in the South Sudan's Eastern Equatoria State was evaluated to determine its suitability for drinking, domestic, and irrigation purposes. A total of 176 groundwater samples were collected during wet (October 2014) and dry (April 2014) seasons. Sampling points were spread around the eight counties of Eastern Equatoria. Twenty two water samples were collected from each county. The samples were analysed for various physicochemical parameters including alkalinity, calcium hardness, conductivity, pH, salinity, TDS, total hardness, Na+ , K+ , Ca2+ , Mg2+ , Ba2+ , CrT , Cd2+ , Cu2+ , FeT , Ni2+ , Zn2+ , Pb2+ , NO3 - , Cl- , F- , SO4 2- , PO4 3- , and SiO2 . Groundwater irrigation quality indices including chlorinity index, Kelli Index, magnesium ratio, percentage of sodium must be replaced by sodium percentage (%Na), permeability index (PI), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), salinity index, sodicity index, and sodium absorption ratio (SAR), were calculated to determine the groundwater suitability for agricultural uses. The results were compared with South Sudan water quality guidelines (SSWQGs) and the WHO standards. Most of the water quality parameters met the WHO standards and SSWQGs prescribed for drinking and domestic purposes. The calculated irrigation water quality indices indicated the water suitability for irrigation.   Graphical abstract fx1       Keywords South Sudan  Groundwater  Water quality assessment  Major ion chemistry  Sustainable development goals    1 Introduction South Sudan became an independent country from Sudan on 9th July 2011 after five decades of civil war that had devastated not only the lives and livelihoods of the South Sudanese people, but also their access to basic needs, including safe water (AfDB, 2013a ). South Sudan is now facing tremendous challenges to meet the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) formulated in 2015 as the 2030 Agenda through water as key to Sustainable Development to overcome poverty, hunger, gender inequity and other adverse impacts (WB, 2011 ). As the corresponding data from South Sudan show (http://southsudan.opendataforafrica.org/apps/gallery ), each of the 17 formulated goals will be a big challenge to achieve (WB, 2011 ). To begin with, safe water provision is the fundamental key. The water topic is not only covered by Goal 6 (clean water and sanitation) but also included in Goal 3 (good health and well being), Goal 10 (fight injustice and inequality), and Goals 14 and 15 (protecting life in aquatic systems and on land), respectively. Provision of chemically-safe water enhances food security contributing to Goals 1 and 2 (eradicating or reducing hunger and poverty) and to Goal 5 (gender equality), reducing the discrimination of girls and women obliged to walk long distances for collecting water. Furthermore, access to safe water and sanitation enhances job creation contributing to achieve Goal 8 (economic growth and decent work) and Goal 9 (innovation, infrastructure and industry – including water and sanitation infrastructure). In view of the above, sustained development in the country, will very much depend on secure access to its substantial water resources (WB, 2011 ). Thus, in the first part of the paper, water availability and supply situation in South Sudan is reviewed. In the second part, groundwater suitability in the South Sudan's eastern Equatoria State for drinking and irrigation purposes is discussed. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time, groundwater chemical composition and variability in space and time are studied to establish a reliable database. This will assist the decision and policy makers in providing safe drinking water and basic sanitation at household level. This study will contribute in establishing a reliable water quality database for a proper development, management, and protection of ground- and surface water resources for sustainable development on the country's way to meet the SDGs (WRC, 2008 ).  2 Key water issues and challenges in South Sudan 2.1 Water availability and supply situation in South Sudan South Sudan's renewable surface and groundwater resources stand at 49.5 km3 /year (AfDB, 2013a ). Rainfall in the country is high, with highland parts of Eastern Equatoria in the southern part and Western Equatoria receiving an annual rainfall between 1200 and 2200 mm ( Fig. 1 ). The lowland areas of Bahr el Ghazal, Eastern Equatoria, Jonglei, and, Upper Nile receive annual rainfall between 700 and 1300 mm (WB, 2011 ).  2.2 Surface water resources The White Nile River, which has its three main tributaries of Bahr el-Ghazal (the three sub-basins of Jur, Kiir, and Loll); the Bahr el-Jebel (tributaries: Aswa, Kiit, and Yei,); and the River Sobat (sub-basins of Pibor and Akobo), run from the south to north through the country. In addition, the country has the second world's largest swamp, the Sudd which covers 30,000 km2 , which has many lakes and which is located on the Bahr el-Jebel River. This swamp area has been declared a Ramsar site. There are other wetland systems along the Bahr el-Ghazal and the River Sobat tributaries (AfDB, 2013a ). All the wetlands comprise 7% of the total area of South Sudan. South Sudan comprises 20% of the total Nile river basin area (AfDB, 2013a ), respectively. Despite these huge freshwater resources, surface water is scarce during the dry season in areas that are not located on the river banks or where some of the tributaries dry up during the dry season.  2.3 Groundwater resources South Sudan possesses large areas of land underlain by rich aquifers. Five main geological and respective hydrogeological units can be distinguished in South Sudan ( Fig. 2 ) (Persits et al., 2002 ; WB, 2011 ):• Tertiary-Quaternary Umm Ruwaba formation found in most of the Greater Upper Nile region and part of the Eastern Equatoria State, its unconsolidated sediments. Seasonal rainfall and river floods predominantly recharge its aquifers and in some parts extend across international boundaries constitute aquifers with low to moderate water productivity;  • Quaternary unconsolidated sediments in the western and eastern flood plains of rivers in Jonglei, Lakes and Unity States with low to high water productivity of aquifers;  • Tertiary igneous volcanic rocks in Eastern Equatoria State and the adjacent part of Jonglei State with a very variable water productivity ranging from very low to high;  • Cretaceous Nubian Sandstone Formation in Northern Bahr el-Gazal State and part of Gokrial State with intergranular sedimentary aquifers of low to high productivity;  • Precambrian basement in part of the Central Equatoria, whole of Western Equatoria and western Bahr el-Gazal States with low water productivity. In this zone, search for groundwater focuses on fractured and weathered zones.    However, little is known regarding recharge, aquifer connectivity and the relation between surface water bodies and groundwater, which would be particularly important in the case of the Umm Ruwaba formation and the overlying surface water bodies, particularly in the swamps zones, demanding more information to establish water balances as base for a sustainable groundwater resources management. Further, there is a need to explore (1)  the distribution and potential of groundwater and springs and (2)  trans-boundary aquifers (GoSS, 2007 ). Currently, groundwater is the main drinking water source in South Sudan, but almost no work has been done to determine its distribution, extraction and quality (AfDB, 2013a ). Salinity, fluoride, nitrate and sulphate in excess of the permissible limits have been reported in groundwater in some parts of Jonglei and Unity states, making groundwater unsafe for consumption (Rutten et al., 2014; WB, 2011 ). Other issues which warrant this research are groundwater quality problems in the oil-producing areas including Unity and Upper Nile States as well as around the waste stabilization and oxidation pond in Juba City.  2.4 Access to water Despite the sufficient surface- and groundwater resources availability, millions of people of South Sudan do not have access to clean water and sanitation services (WB, 2011 . About half of the population does not have access to an improved water source within a distance of 1 km from their living place in the dry season (GoSS, 2007 ). It has been widely reported that in Juba, the national capital of South Sudan, and few other towns, only 50% of people have access to clean water and ~10% have access to sanitation (Christiansen and Sullivan, 2012 ). In the rural areas, ~47% have access to clean water and 7% to sanitation.  2.5 Water infrastructure South Sudan was the most deprived and marginalized region of the Old Sudan. The long neglect from the central government, coupled with the consequences of the two consecutive civil wars fought during the last five decades, caused the region to be devastated, and left virtually with either few obsolete or no water infrastructure (AfDB, 2013a; GoSS, 2007; RSS, 2011 ). After independence, many wells and boreholes were constructed as a shortcut to provide safe water for domestic use to its urban and rural population. The wells and boreholes constructed after South Sudan independence with their depths are reported in the range from 14 to 150 m in Lomelto and Lofiri villages of Magwi and Torit counties in Eastern Equatoria State, respectively; 14–100 min Daplual and Nyandong villages of Mayendit and Panyijiar Counties in Unity State, respectively; 12–84 m in Abienyi and Banken villages of Nasir and Maban counties of the Upper Nile State, respectively (MWRI, 2011 ). Groundwater from these wells and boreholes has been considered to be safe by the government authorities without any prior water quality assessment. Thus, groundwater quality analysis is urgently needed to determine its suitability for drinking, domestic and irrigation purposes (Anku et al., 2009 ). Moreover, withdrawal of water from the wells must be linked not only to its quality, but also to its level and quantity to allow a better and optimised water resources management without overexploiting the resources (WB, 2011 ). The average availability of water per person is estimated at 15 litres/capita/day, in urban areas which is alarmingly lower compared to most urban towns in Africa (a minimum average of 50 litres/capita/day) (Rutten et al., 2014 ). Insufficient water supply, lack of access to improved sanitation services, coupled with poor awareness to hygiene, mean occurrence of waterborne diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea and Guinea worm is high (Rutten et al., 2014 ). Guinea worm is transmitted through drinking, contaminated and stagnant water (AfDB, 2013a ). Cholera and diarrhoea diseases kill thousands of people in the country every year due to unavailability of safe potable water. There were 6421 suspected cases including 167 deaths due to May 2014 cholera outbreak (UNICEF, 2015 ). The frequent diarrhoeal disease incidences occur in South Sudnan, often associated with lack of access to sanitation and safe water (RSS, 2011 ). In 2010, a household survey estimated that more than one child in 10 died before completing five years (UNICEF, 2015 ).  2.6 Recent water policy Cognizant of the importance of the safe water for human consumption and irrigation, the South Sudanese government has gone one step ahead to produce a water policy to provide access to clean water supply and sanitation (AfDB, 2013a ). In the policy, water is considered to be a human right issue and therefore given the highest priority (AfDB, 2013a ). The policy also stresses the need for investments in urban and rural water supply and sanitation infrastructure (RSS, 2007 ). The recent development in the water sector in South Sudan is outlined in Table SM1 . However, till today, a groundwater quality assessment in relation to its suitability for drinking and irrigation purposes is missing in South Sudan, whereas it is considered to be a routine practice in other countries (Abdellah et al., 2013; Belkhiri et al., 2012; Bhoopathi et al., 2014; Bikundia and Mohan, 2014; Douagui et al., 2012; Ekwere et al., 2012; Grimason et al., 2013; Hagras, 2013; Hussain et al., 2012; Jamshidzadeh and Mirbagheri, 2011; Jimmy et al., 2013; Ketata et al., 2011; Lutza et al., 2013; Moyo, 2013; Rango et al., 2012; Singh et al., 2012; Wanda et al., 2011 ).  2.7 Geology and hydrogeology Four of the five principal geological and respective hydrogeological units described for South Sudan (Section 2.3 ) are found in Equatoria State ( Fig. 3 a). The Umm Ruwaba formation with low to moderate water productivity covers about half of the state where it is found in the northern and south eastern part; Precambrian basement covers about a third of the state in its southern and western part, igneous tertiary volcanic rocks with very low to high aquifer productivity occur in the eastern part of the state; and along the rivers, Quaternary unconsolidated sediments (low to high water productivity). The main aquifer types in Eastern Equatoria state are Unconsolidated sedimentary rocks of Tertiary-Quaternary Umm Ruwaba formations and Basement rock type aquifer. Both these aquifers are rain fed and depends on seasonal rainfalls for recharging (BGS, 2018 ). The region is also rich in carbonate containing deposits (dolomite and marble) (MPM, 2013 ).  2.8 Geography, livelihoods and ethnicities Eastern Equatoria is part of the hills and mountains livelihood zone (AfDB, 2013a ). The state is characterized by different agro-ecological zones, with a relatively complex mosaic of ecosystems, varying in altitude between ~440 to ~3100 m above mean sea level (m.a.m.s.l) on both the northwest as well as on the southeast axis. The corresponding annual rain fall occurs between 800 and 2200 mm on northwest axis and between 600 and 200 mm going to the extreme eastern part of the State (Kapoeta East County), respectively (ProWaS/SSN-EES, 2013 ). The counties situated on the northwest side of the state (e.g. Lopa/Lafon) have large flood plains with seasonal streams flowing in north-west direction, which mainly dry up during the dry season (ProWaS/SSN-EES, 2013 ). Eastern Equatoria State is a home to many ethnic groups such as Acholi, Otuho, and Toposa. Most of these ethnicities live on subsistence farming and raising cattle and goats. The Didinga Hills of Budi County in particular have a fertile soil which is suitable for maize, potatoes, tobacco and Sclerochloadura (a common hard grass) cultivation (GeoHive, 2014 ). In the recent past anthropogenic activities have been increased in Eastern African countries including South Sudan. Agricultural practices and forest cutting have increased tremendously (Guzha et al., 2018 ). Eastern Equatoria is an agricultural intensive state of South Sudan, with ~86% population depending on agriculture (AfDB, 2013b ). These activities along with increasing groundwater usage by increasing population have put immense pressure on the aquifers (Guzha et al., 2018 ). Approximately 85% population in South Sudan defecates openly (AfDB, 2013c ). Unhygienic livelihood and contamination of surface and groundwater sources with human wastes (faeces and urine) along with other anthropogenic contaminants are also rising every day (Engström et al., 2015 ).   3 Material and methods 3.1 Study area Administratively, Eastern Equatoria State is one of the ten states in South Sudan located within the Greater Equatoria Region in the southeast of the country (Fig. 3 a). It extends from latitudes 3°29′16′′ to 6°0′2′′ N and longitudes 31°45'18" to 35°57'44" E. The state is surrounded by the Jonglei State to the north, and the Central Equatoria State to the west and internationally by Ethiopia to the northeast, Kenya to the southeast, Uganda to the south. The state has a population of 906,161 distributed over an area of 73,472 km2  (Census, 2008 ). Torit is the state capital.  3.2 Sampling methodology A total of 176 groundwater samples, covering both dry and wet seasons were collected from the wells scattered around the eight counties of the Eastern Equatoria State (Fig. 3 b). From each county, a total of 16 water samples were collected for physicochemical parameter analysis. In addition, 6 water samples were collected from each county during dry and wet seasons for heavy metal determination. The dry season water samples were collected in the month of April and those for wet season in the month of October 2014. All water samples were collected in 1 L pre-deionized water-washed polyethylene bottles. The water samples for heavy metal analyses were collected in pre-acid-washed LDPE bottles and were preserved by adding few drops of 0.1 N HNO3  at the sampling site (pH <2). A calibrated GPS (model Garmin 12) was used to record the geographic coordinates (latitudes and longitudes) of the wells (Fig. 3 b, Table SM2 ). Local state or county authorities were also consulted in the selection of the wells. All water samples were labelled and stored in ice boxes. These samples were then transported to the laboratory (School of Environmental Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India) for further analysis.  3.3 Analytical procedures All the water samples were analysed for pH, conductivity, total dissolved solid (TDS), total alkalinity, total hardness, calcium hardness, magnesium hardness, HCO3 - , CO3 2- , Cl- , F- , NO3 - , PO4 3- , SiO2 , Na+ , K+ , Ca2+ , Mg2+ , FeT , Cd2+ , Cu2+ , Pb2+ , Zn2+ , CrT , and Ni2+  using standard methods (APHA, 2005 ). EC, pH and TDS were measured using a multi-ion meter (model Orion 5 star, Thermo Scientific). Calcium hardness, total hardness and total alkalinity, were determined titrimetrically. Calcium, potassium and sodium concentrations were determined using flame photometer (model CL 378, ELICO). Chloride concentration was measured by the silver nitrate titration method (APHA, 2006 ). Bicarbonate concentration was measured by H2 SO4  titration method. Sulphate, phosphate, dissolved silicate, fluoride and nitrate concentrations were measured colorimetrically using a UV–VIS spectrophotometer (model Lambda 35, Perkin Elmer). Iron, cadmium, copper, lead, zinc, nickel, and total chromium concentrations were determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometer (model Aanalyst 400, Perkin Elmer). All the analyses were carried out in the laboratory following quality control and quality assurance (QA/QC) procedures (Table SM3 ). The quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) was established through standardization, blanks (field, instrument and trip blanks), spiking and samples duplication. The precisions of the analytical procedures are reported as relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) and ranged from 5% to 10%. Metals recoveries from the spiked water samples were also determine to study the matrix effect using standard addition method. Blanks were run and corrections were made, wherever needed.  3.4 Methodology to determine water chemistry and hydrogeological processes 3.4.1 Evaluation of groundwater for drinking purposes In order to determine groundwater hydrochemical characteristics/facies, controlling mechanisms, chemical evolution, and contamination sources, the physicochemical parameters were analysed using Piper tri-linear diagram, Gibbs plot, base-exchange index, meteoric genesis index, and correlation matrix. Piper tri-linear diagram  (Piper, 1944, 1953 ) was constructed using AqQA software version 1.5. Gibbs plot  [(Na+ )/(Na+ +Ca2+ ) versus TDS] and [(Cl- /(Cl- +HCO3 - ) versus TDS] (Gibbs, 1970 ) was used to study the hydrogeochemical processes. Base-exchange index (r 1  )  was used to classify groundwater samples (Soltan, 1998, 1999 ). The base-exchange index was calculated using Eq. (1) :(1) Base  − exchange index  (  r  1   )  =   Na  +   −  Cl  −    SO  4  2 −         where ion (Na+ , Cl-  and SO4 2- ) concentrations are expressed in meq/L. Meteoric genesis index  was used to categorize groundwater based on its percolation into subsurface (Bikundia and Mohan, 2014; Soltan, 1998, 1999 ). The Meteoric genesis index (r2 ) was calculated using Eq. (2) :(2) Meteoric genesis index  ( r  2   )  = ( Na   +   +  K  +   ) −  Cl  −    SO  4  2 −         where ion (Na+ , K+ , Cl-  and SO4 2- ) concentrations are expressed in meq/L. Bivariate correlation analysis  was applied to find the closeness and the degree of linear association between dependent and independent physicochemical groundwater variables (Singh et al., 2012 ).  3.4.2 Evaluation of ground water for irrigation purposes Chlorinity index, salinity index, sodicity index, sodium absorption ratio (SAR), sodium percentage (%Na), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), Kelli Index, magnesium ratio, and permeability index (PI) were calculated to determine the water suitability for irrigation purposes. Electrical conductivity (µS/cm) values were used to determine salinity index (Richard, 1954; Singh et al., 2006 ). Based on EC values, irrigational water was divided in six classes (Table SM4 ). Chlorinity indices were determined using chloride concentrations (Bikundia and Mohan, 2014; Mills, 2003; Singh et al., 2006, 2012 ). Irrigational water was further divided in five classes (I to V) based on chloride concentrations (Table SM5 ). Sodicity hazards is a problem associated with the long term use of a particular type of irrigation water resulting into the crop yield reduction. The adverse irrigation water quality effect on soil physical properties is associated with the sodium ion accumulation. Sodium absorption ratio (SAR) of the irrigation water is calculated using Eq. (3)  (Bikundia and Mohan, 2014; Singh et al., 2006; Wilcox, 1955 ). Based on SAR values, irrigational water was divided into five sodicity hazard classes (I to V) (Table SM6 ) (Singh et al., 2006, 2012 ).(3) SAR  =  Na  +    ( Ca   2 +   +  Mg  2 +   ) / 2           The concentrations of Na+ , Ca2+ , and Mg2+  are represented in meq/L. Residual sodium carbonate (RSC) was also used to test groundwater irrigation quality (Singh et al., 2012 ). RSC was calculated using Eq. (4) .(4) RSC = (HCO3 -  +CO3 2- ) – (Ca2+  + Mg2+ )   Where, HCO3 - , CO3 2- , Ca2+ , and Mg2+  concentrations are represented in meq/L. Water is considered safe if RSC values are < 1.25 meq/L. RSC values between 1.25 and 2.5 meq/L consider the water quality to be marginal. RSC values exceeding 2.5 meq/L did not consider water to be appropriate for irrigation (Table 3 ) (Eaton, 1950 ). The US Salinity Laboratory's diagram is used to classify irrigation water samples based on the sodium and salinity hazards. The Salinity diagram is divided into 16 areas to rate the degree at which a particular water sample gives rise to salinity problems (Bikundia and Mohan, 2014 ). Wilcox diagram:  Electrical conductivity and percent sodium (% Na+ ) were used to construct the Wilcox diagram as another means to further classify groundwater for irrigational purpose (Wilcox, 1955 ). The percent sodium is calculated using Eq. (5) .(5) %  Na    +   ⁢  =   ( Na  +   +  K  +    )  ⁢   x  ⁢  100   ( Ca   2 +   ⁢  +  Mg  2 +   ⁢  +   Na  +   +  K  +   )        Kelly index (KI) (Kelly, 1940 ) was used to classify groundwater for irrigational purposes. Kelly Index (KI) is determined using Eq. (6)  (Kelly, 1940; Sundaray et al., 2009 ):(6) Kelly index   ( KI  )   ⁢   = Na  +    ( Ca   2 +   ⁢ +  Mg  2 +   )        All the ionic concentrations are expressed in meq/L. Water samples having KI > 1 are considered unsuitable for irrigation, while those having KI < 1 are taken suitable for irrigation (Kelly, 1940; Sundaray et al., 2009 ). Magnesium ratio (Szabolcs and Darab, 1964 ) was calculated using Eq. (7)  and used to evaluate water to be used for irrigation.(7) Magnesium ratio  ⁢   = Mg  2 +   ⁢  x  ⁢  100   ( Ca   2 +   ⁢ +  Mg  2 +   )        All the ionic concentrations are expressed in meq/L. Magnesium ratio < 50% is considered to be suitable for irrigation, while water samples having higher ratios adversely affect the crop yields (Raju et al., 2011 ). Permeability index (Doneen, 1964 ) was used to examine and categorize soil permeability to determine the water suitability for irrigation purpose. Soil permeability is influenced by long term use of certain irrigation water containing Na+ , Ca2+ , Mg2+  and HCO3 -  (Raju, 2007 ). Permeability index was calculated using Eq. (8) .(8) Permeability index  ( PI  )    =   ( Na  +   ⁢ +  HCO  3  −      )     x  ⁢  100   ( Ca  2 +   ⁢  +   Mg  2 +   ⁢  +   Na  +   )        All ionic concentrations are taken in meq/L. Water can be divided into class I, II and III. Class I and II are suitable for irrigation and characterized by ≥ 75% permeability. Permeability index (PI) of < 25% or Class III is not suitable for irrigational purpose. Chloro alkaline index (CAI) (Schoeller classification) was used to find the ion exchange between groundwater and its surroundings during travelling or residence in the aquifer. CAI was calculated using Eq. (9) .(9) Chloro alkaline index  ⁢   ( CAI  )  ⁢  = [ Cl   −   −  ( Na   +   +  K  +   ) ]   Cl  −          All ionic concentrations are represented as meq/L. The negative CAI values indicate the base-exchange reactions take place between aqueous sodium and potassium (Na+  + K+ ) with calcium and magnesium (Ca2+  + Mg2+ ) in the rocks. Positive CAI values suggest the base-exchange absence and cation-anion exchange presence (Raju, 2007 ).    4 Results and discussion 4.1 General Physicochemical parameters of the groundwater samples collected from the study area during dry (April 2014) and wet (October 2014) seasons are presented in   Table 1[(a) and (b) ]. The results are summarized in a form of descriptive statistics including maximum, minimum, range, mean, median, and standard deviation. The percentage of samples exceeding the permissible limits of the South Sudan Water Quality Guidelines (SSWQGs) and the WHO are also included.  4.2 Physicochemical characteristics of groundwater and its suitability for drinking-water quality The pH of the water samples during the dry season ranges between 7.2 and 8.5 (mean 7.9), while in the wet season, it varies from 6.78 to 8.2 (mean 7.5) [Table 1(a-b) ]. All the pH values are within the permissible limit of 6.5–8.5 (WHO, 1993) and 6.0–8.5 (SSWQGs, 2008). The EC values of the water samples range from 247.6 to 2982 µS/cm (mean 914 µS/cm) and 247.7–3910 µS/cm (mean 1015.3 µS/cm) during the dry and wet seasons, respectively. During dry season, only 11% and 16% exceeded the WHO (1400 µS/cm) and SSWQGs (1500 µS/cm) permissible limits, respectively [Table 1(a-b) ]. During wet season, ~19% samples exceeded the WHO and SSWQGs permissible limits [Table 1(a-b) ]. The TDS values varied from 121 to 1467 mg/L (mean 449 mg/L) and 121–1923 mg/L (mean 515 mg/L) during dry and wet seasons, respectively [Table 1(a-b) ]. About 3% and 19% of dry season samples exceeded the SSWQGs (<1000 mg/L) and WHO (600 mg/L) limits. Similarly, 6% and 23% of wet season samples exceed the SSWQGs and WHO desirable limits [Table 1(a-b) ]. Water alkalinity varies from 30 to 760 mg/L as CaCO3  (mean 321 mg/L) during dry season and 140–3990 mg/L as CaCO3  (mean 1706.3 mg/L) in wet seasons [Table 1(a-b) ]. About 83% and 11% of dry season samples exceed the SSWQGs (200 mg/L as CaCO3 ) and WHO (500 mg/L as CaCO3 ) limits, respectively [Table 1(a-b) ]. Almost all wet season samples exceed the SSWQGs (98% samples) and WHO (94% samples) standards.  Fig. 4 (a,b) shows the spatial distribution of alkalinity during dry and wet seasons in Eastern Equatoria. The central, western and north-eastern regions of the state show an increase in alkalinity in wet season samples [Fig. 4 (b)]. Since majority of groundwater is controlled by rock-water interaction during dry and wet seasons, high groundwater alkalinity may be due to groundwater interactions with CaCO3 -MgCO3  and Ca(HCO3 )2 -Mg(HCO3 )2  type rocks. These carbonate rocks may initiate geochemical transformations resulting into an increase in groundwater alkalinity (Krainov et al., 2001 ). These results suggest that groundwater in the study area is characterized by high buffering capacity during the wet season [Table 1(a-b) ]. Since the aquifers in study area are rich in dolomite and other carbonate rich rock deposits and are rainfed (MPM, 2013 ), the stormwater during wet season may enrich groundwater with carbonate and enhance its alkalinity. Bicarbonate varies from 68.3 to 224.5 mg/L (mean 122.8 mg/L) and negligible to 866.2 mg/L (mean 321.4 mg/L) during dry and wet seasons, respectively [Table 1(a-b) ]. Groundwater bicarbonate suggests release from biogenic and mineral sources (Bikundia and Mohan, 2014 ; Younger, 2007 ). Bicarbonate biogenic formation takes place due to CO2  released by plant roots into the soil is used by the soil microbes. Thus, it is degraded into an organic matter and bicarbonate is formed as a by-product. Bicarbonate could also be formed by CO2  dissolution directly into the soil water (Younger, 2007 ). Carbonate varies from 25.3 to 178 mg/L (mean 47.2 mg/L) and negligible to 320.4 mg/L (mean 118.9 mg/L) during dry and wet season periods, respectively [Table 1(a-b) ]. Nitrate, sulphate, phosphate and silicates were all within the WHO and SSWQGs permissible limits in majority of the dry and wet season samples. In case of nitrate, only 5% dry and 6% wet season samples exceed the WHO (50 mg/L) and SSWQGs (30 mg/L)limits, respectively [Table 1(a-b) ]. High nitrate concentrations exceeding the regulatory limits were estimated in the groundwater where agricultural activities are taking place; these waters are unsuitable for drinking and particularly a hazard for children as it can cause the blue baby syndrome or methemoglobinemia disease in infants (Saba et al., 2006 ). Total hardness varies from 100 to 9500 mg/L as CaCO3  (mean 1645 mg/L as CaCO3 ) and 74–728 mg/L (as CaCO3 ) (mean 226.6 mg/L as CaCO3 ), during dry and wet seasons, respectively [Table 1(a-b) ]. About 97% and 69% of dry and wet season samples exceed the WHO and SSWQGs permissible limit (200 mg/L as CaCO3 ). Most of the groundwater samples are hard (200–300 mg/L as CaCO3 ) to very hard (>300 mg/L as CaCO3 ) in both the seasons [Table 1(a-b) ]. Very hard to hard water develops scale in water heaters, distribution pipes, and also consumes more soap [Table 1(a-b) ]. Thus, from an aesthetic and practical view point, these samples are unsuitable for drinking. 4.2.1 Anion chemistry Anion concentrations of the groundwater samples are summarized in [Table 1(a-b) ]. Chloride concentration varies from 450 to 4848 mg/L (mean 1018.6 mg/L) and 130–7378 mg/L (mean 784 mg/L) during dry and wet seasons, respectively [Table 1(a-b) ]. Almost 100% of dry season samples exceed the WHO (250 mg/L) and SSWQGs (200 mg/L) limits. On the other hand, 58% and 77% wet season samples exceed the WHO and SSWQGs desirable limits, respectively [Table 1(a-b) ]. High chloride indicates groundwater contamination due to both anthropogenic and natural sources (Bikundia and Mohan, 2014 ). Release of chloride into the groundwater may also be through ion-exchange processes (Bikundia and Mohan, 2014 ; Drever, 1997 ). Previously, high anthropogenic contamination in the region was reported (Engström et al., 2015 ). Thus, increased contamination could be due to high anthropogenic activities. About 9% and 22% of dry season samples exceed the WHO and SSWQGs permissible fluoride limits of 1.5 and 1 mg/L, respectively. About 69% of wet season samples exceed the SSWQGs permissible limit of 1.0 mg/L [Table 1(a-b) ]. As there are no fluoride emitting industries in the study area, fluoride contamination is due to geogenic origin as e.g. the volcanic rocks present in parts of the study area. The high fluoride concentrations exceeding the regulatory limits in drinking water may cause dental and skeletal fluorosis (Bundschuh et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2012 ). For a tropical country such as South Sudan, excess fluoride in the water can economically be remediated at household scale using pottery water containers made of tropical soil rich in calcium and aluminium oxides (Fawell et al., 2006 ). Other locally available biosorbents can also be considered for fluoride remediation.  4.2.2 Cation chemistry Calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium were determined in groundwater samples. Groundwater calcium concentrations in the study area vary from negligible to 42.5 mg/L (mean 11 mg/L) and 4.4–186 mg/L (mean 11.8 mg/L) in dry and wet seasons, respectively [Table 1(a-b) ]. None of the sample goes beyond the calcium permissible limits of WHO (100 mg/L) and SSWQGs (80–150 mg/L) in any seasons. Sodium values range between negligible and 887 mg/L (mean 163 mg/L) and 16 and 708 mg/L (mean 118 mg/L) in dry and wet seasons periods, respectively [Table 1(a-b) ]. About 31% and 28% of dry season and about 38% and 13% of wet season samples exceed the permissible limits of SSWQGs (100 mg/L) and WHO (200 mg/L), respectively [Table 1(a-b) ]. Potassium varies from negligible to 34.6 mg/L (mean 10 mg/L) and 3.3–151 mg/L (mean 9.2 mg/L) during dry and wet season periods, respectively [Table 1(a-b) ]. About 20% of dry and 2–5% of wet seasons samples surpass the SSWQGs (25–50 mg/L) and WHO (12 mg/L) limits, respectively [Table 1(a-b) ]. Application of potash fertilizer and potash silicate weathering may be considered as source for high potassium in groundwater (Jain et al., 2010 ). Magnesium varies from 19.1 to 2286.2 mg/L (mean 393 mg/L) and from 15.2 to 114.3 mg/L (mean 47.9 mg/L) during dry and wet seasons, respectively [Table 1(a-b) ]. About 96% of dry season samples exceed the permissible limits of WHO (30 mg/L) and SSWQGs (30–70 mg/L). During wet season period, 13–86% violated the WHO (30 mg/L) and SSWQGs (30–70 mg/L) limits, respectively [Table 1(a-b) ]. Heavy metals in an aquatic environment in general and groundwater in particular are progressively becoming a health concern due to their toxicity and bioaccumulation (Bikundia and Mohan, 2014 ). Heavy metals are introduced into the environment by both anthropogenic and geogenic activities. Geogenic sources include rock weathering and artificially by sewage discharge, industrial effluent, and unplanned waste disposal (CPCB, 2008 ). Iron, cadmium, copper, lead, chromium, nickel, and zinc concentrations determined in the groundwater samples are given in [Table 1(a-b) ]. Ni2+ , CrT , Zn2+  and Cu2+  were within the permissible limits set by both the SSWQGs and WHO [Table 1(a-b) ]. However, FeT , Pb2+  and Cd2+ concentrations exceed the permissible limits in dry and wet season periods. Iron concentrations vary from 0.02 to 3.6 mg/L (mean 1 mg/L) and from 0.08 to 3.34 mg/L (mean 0.41 mg/L) during dry and wet seasons, respectively [Table 1(a-b) ]. About 71% and 50% of dry season and 64% and 48% of wet season samples exceed the WHO (0.3 mg/L) and SSWQGs (0.5 mg/L) permissible limits [Table 1(a-b) ]. Iron presence in natural water is attributed to the acid mine drainage, landfill leachate, minerals and rocks dissolution, sewage or engineering industries (Fu and Wang, 2011 ). In the study area, the iron presence in water is mainly due to dissolution from minerals and rocks. Locally, landfill leachate and sewage may be also considered as additional anthropogenic source of aqueous iron. Cadmium concentrations vary from 0.003 to 0.009 mg/L (mean 0.005 mg/L) and negligible to 0.053 mg/L (mean 0.009 mg/L) during dry and wet seasons, respectively [Table 1(a-b) ]. About 96% and 25% of dry season samples exceed the WHO permissible limit (0.003 mg/L) and SSWQGs (0.003–0.005 mg/L), respectively [Table 1(a-b) ]. About 92% of wet season samples violate both WHO and SSWQGs permissible limits. Lead concentrations vary from 0.027 to 0.147 mg/L (mean 0.049 mg/L) and 0.007–0.216 mg/L (mean 0.02 mg/L) during dry and wet seasons, respectively [Table 1(a-b) ]. Almost all dry season samples and ~92% of wet season samples surpassed WHO and SSWQGs permissible limit of 0.01 mg/L [Table 1(a-b) ].  4.2.3 Hydrochemical characteristics and hydrogeological processes 4.2.3.1 Piper diagram The concentrations of major cations and anions were plotted into the Piper diagram ( Fig. 5 ). The Piper diagram shows that strong acidic anions (Cl- +SO4 2- ) dominate over weak acid anions (HCO3 - ) in dry and wet seasons samples. Water chemistry is significantly different in dry and wet seasons. In dry season, the water chemistry was uniform in the Piper diagram. Almost all groundwater samples were of magnesium chloride type (>80% chloride and magnesium, respectively). In all samples, permanent hardness exceeds temporary hardness. However, in the wet season, water samples show a much larger scattering in the Piper diagram. The important hydrochemical facies include (Ca2+  -Mg2+ - Cl-  -SO4 2- ), followed by (Ca2+ - Mg2+ - HCO3 - ) and (Na+ - K+ - Cl-  - SO4 2- ). This wider scattering in the wet season may be due to the rainfall (including infiltration via surface bodies) influences the groundwater chemistry in various ways, depending on aquifer type (unconfined or confined, unconsolidated, hard rock and fracturing grade), depth to groundwater table, which is highly variable in the project area (14–150 m), material/composition and permeability of the unsaturated zone, rainfall variability and presence of anthropogenic contaminants. The individual importance of different influences cannot be determined due to lack of data.  4.2.3.2 Gibbs plot The Gibbs diagrams [total dissolved solids versus relative cation abundances i.e. TDS versus (Na+ )/(Na+ +Ca2+ ) and total dissolved solids versus relative anion abundance i.e. TDS versus (Cl- )/(Cl- +HCO3 - )] obtained in dry and wet seasons are shown in  Fig. 6 a and b, respectively. The Gibbs diagrams clearly show that groundwater chemistry of majority of samples is mainly controlled by evaporation during dry season whereas rock-water interaction governs the chemistry during wet season [Fig. 6 (a-b)]. However, chemistry of few samples is governed by evaporation process in both the seasons [Fig. 6 (a-b)]. Thus, weathering and mineralization may be considered as major factors in the groundwater chemical composition evolution. Furthermore, an increase in TDS due to increase in Cl-  and Na+  concentrations indicate that anthropogenic activities are also contributing to the chemical evolution in the selected study area.  4.2.3.3 Base-exchange indices Groundwater classification using base-exchange index (r1 ) are summarized in  Table 2 . About 95% and 5% of the collected groundwater samples are classified as Na+  -SO4 2-  type (r1  < 1) and Na+ -HCO3 -  type (r1  > 1) in both dry and wet seasons, respectively (Table 2 ).  4.2.3.4 Meteoric genesis indices Meteoric genesis indices values are recorded in Table 2 . About 95% water samples in the study area correspond to deep meteoric water percolation (r2  < 1) while 5% samples belong to shallow meteoric water percolation (r2  > 1) in dry and wet seasons, respectively (Table 2 ).    4.3 Groundwater quality evaluation for irrigation purposes Groundwater suitability for irrigation was determined using degree of its acidity or alkalinity, sodium percentage (% Na), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and its relation to EC,residual sodium carbonate (RSC), Kelli Index, magnesium ratio, and permeability index (PI). Groundwater samples rating based on electrical conductivity (EC) and % Na are shown in  Fig. 7 . 4.3.1 Salinity index Groundwater samples were classified based on their EC values within a six-class ranking system according to their suitability for irrigation (Table SM3 ). Only 2% water samples (dry and wet seasons) are characterized as Class I, which can be used for irrigation to all plants without any problem. About 52% samples in dry season and 47% samples in wet season are characterized as Class II which can additionally be used for very low salt tolerant crops. About 5% in dry season and 4% in wet season samples are characterized as high (Class III) and very high (Class 4) salinity. Thus, these water samples can only be used on high salt tolerant crops and may not be used for long-term irrigation purposes due to salinization hazard for soils.  4.3.2 Chlorinity index Groundwater samples were classified based on their chloride concentrations within a five-class ranking system according to their suitability for irrigation (Table SM5 , Figure SM1 ). No dry season sample and 54% wet season samples are categorized as Class I and fit for all types of crops. About 69% of dry season and 23% of wet season samples are categorized as Class II water (fit for high, medium, low salt-tolerant crops). About 3%, 13% and 15% in dry season and 3%, 9% and 11% during wet season samples are categorized as Class III (fit for high, medium, low salt tolerant crops), Class IV (only fit for high salt-tolerant crops) and Class V (not fit for any plant), respectively. Majority of the groundwater samples are categorized as Class I during dry season and Class II during wet season and therefore, suitable for irrigation in the study area.  4.3.3 Sodicity index or alkalinity hazards The sodicity indices were also calculated to classify water samples regarding their plant toxicity and hazard for deteriorating soil characteristic (Table SM6 , Figure SM2 ). Most of groundwater samples in both the seasons fall in Class I (i.e. no sodium problem) and only a few samples (5)  fall in Class II (i.e. few problems except with sodium-sensitive crops).  4.3.4 Residual sodium carbonate RSC groundwater values during the dry and wet seasons are given in Figure SM3 . During dry season, all water samples having RSC < 1.25 meq/L fall under the safe category and can be considered for irrigation (Figure SM3 ,  Table 3 ). On the other hand, only 38%, 17% and 45% of wet season samples are considered to be safe, marginally safe and unsuitable for irrigation purposes, respectively (Figure SM3 ).  4.3.5 The US Salinity Laboratory's diagram Groundwater sample data were also plotted into the US Salinity Laboratory (USSL) diagram characterizing the combined effects of sodium, i.e. undesirable ion-exchange effects in the soil (Classes S1-S4) and salinity hazards (Classes C1-C4) for irrigation purposes [Fig. 7 (a-b),  Table 4 ]. In the dry and wet season, 98% and 92% or the samples are categorized as low alkali hazard S1 (falling in the fields of medium C2 S1 and high salinity C3 S1 ). Only a few samples have very high salinity and low, medium and high/very high sodium hazard (C4 S1 , C4 S2 , C4 S3 , C4 S4 ) in dry season. Water samples collected from Hai El Shaggal (Torit County), Hiyala (Hiyala Payam), and Mawanga Boma (Chorokol Payam) during dry and wet seasons have very high salinity hazard [ Fig. 8 (a,b)]. In addition, few samples show high salinity and medium sodium hazards (C3 S2 ), high salinity and high sodium hazards (C3 S3 ), high salinity and very high sodium hazards (C3 S4 ) and very high salinity and very high sodium hazards (C4 S4 ). These include water samples collected from Torit County (3–5), Kudo Payam (6 and 7), Nimule Payam (25 and 26), Kapoeta South County (28–30), Paringa Payam (36), Riwoto Town (39–42), Nadapal Payam (43), Narus town (44–46), Budi County (51), Nakuwa, Chukudum Town (55), Ikwotos County, Ikwotos Town (57, 64) during dry season [Fig. 8 (a)]. In addition, water samples collected from Hai metaar, Torit County (2), Lafon school (13), Lafon mission, Lafon (15), Malekia east, Nimule Payam (27), Katiko Payam (35), Chumakori (38), and Lopodopod Payam (48) fall under high salinity hazard [Fig. 8 (b)]. Thus, the groundwater salinity is widely distributed in ten counties of Eastern Equatoria. The predominance of water samples falling in C2 S1 and C3 S1  indicates low sodium hazard and medium to high salinity hazards being suitable for irrigation.  4.3.6 Wilcox diagram According to the Wilcox diagrams (Fig. 9 (a-b),  Table 5 ), about 75% and 11% of the groundwater samples are categorized as excellent, 20% and 53% as good to permissible, 5% and 23% as permissible to doubtful, negligible and 11% as doubtful to unsuitable for irrigation during dry and wet seasons, respectively [ Fig. 9 (a-b)]. Water samples collected from Hai El Sheggal, Torit County (1), Hiyalla, Hiyala Payam (8), Ikwotos-Idwele, Ikwotos County (61) and Mawanga Boma, Chorokul Payam were doubtful to unsuitable during dry season [ Fig. 10 (a)]. In addition, water quality of Atabpakori, Rowoto Town (41) was unsuitable for irrigation [Fig. 10 (b)]. Majority of groundwater samples fall under categories of excellent to good and good to permissible in dry and wet seasons, respectively. These results clearly demonstartae that the majority of the water samples are suitable for irrigation from percent sodium view point.  4.3.7 Kelly index In both the seasons, majority large number of the water samples in the study area fall within the KI < 1 class; making 100% of the waters suitable for irrigation in the dry and wet seasons, respectively.  4.3.8 Magnesium ratio About 87% of dry season samples and 77% of wet season samples have a magnesium ratio of > 50% and hence are not suitable for irrigation purposes since its use adversely affects crop yields through increasing soil structure.  4.3.9 Permeability index The majority of the water samples fall in the PI category III of ≤ 25 during dry and wet seasons. Based on permeability index, greater number of water samples are unsuitable for irrigation. Use of these samples will further reduce soil permeability due to dominance of Na+ , Mg2+  (and Ca2+ ) versus Na+  + HCO3 - .  4.3.10 Chloro-alkaline index 5% of dry and wet season samples show negative values, thereby, indicating base-exchange reactions. Rest of the dry and wet season samples (95%) of show positive values, thereby, categorized as cation-anion reaction type.    5 Conclusions The groundwater quality in the South Sudan's Eastern Equatoria State was assessed for its suitability for drinking, domestic and irrigation purposes. A total of 176 groundwater samples were collected during the dry and wet seasons of 2014 from the eight counties of the state and analysed for 27 physicochemical water quality parameters. The pH values of the water samples in both the dry and wet seasons were within the permissible limits. A number of samples exceeded the WHO permissible limits set for EC, TDS, TALK, TH, Cl-  during dry and wet seasons. Concentrations of SO4 2- , SiO2  and PO4 3-  were within the permissible limits of WHO and SSWQGs. Only 5% in dry and 6% in wet seasons crossed the NO3 -  permissible limit. Furthermore, 9% and 22% dry season samples violated the fluoride permissible limits of 1.5 (WHO) and 1.0 mg/L (SSWQGs). During wet season, 69% samples were unsafe as per SSWQGs fluoride desirable limit. Calcium and sodium concentrations were within the limit as set by WHO and SSWQGs. Hai El Shaggal (Torit County), Hiyala (Hiyala Payam), and Mawanga Boma (Chorokol Payam) regions had high salinity problem. Hai El Sheggal (Torit County), Hiyalla ( Hiyala Payam), Ikwotos-Idwele (Ikwotos County), Mawanga Boma (Chorokul Payam), Atabpakori (Rowoto Town) water quality was unsuitable for irrigation. The central, western and north-eastern regions of the state showed high alkalinity in wet season samples. Since majority of groundwater is controlled by rock-water interaction during dry and wet season, high alkalinity in groundwater could be attributed to interactions of CaCO3 -MgCO3  and Ca(HCO3 )2 -Mg(HCO3 )2  type rocks with groundwater. Based on the above observations, it is highly recommended that:• sustainable development of the groundwater is necessary in and around study area as well as in the entire South Sudan.  • it is necessary to identify wells where groundwater sources are sufficient in quantity and able to meet the demands (Macdonald et al., 2009 );  • wells must be protected from anthropogenic sources which may lead to contamination  • institutional capacity building in the area and the whole nation, capable of assessing chemical and microbiological water quality is provided;  • low cost treatment technologies including biochar, geological materials, etc. may be considered depending on specific local conditions.
