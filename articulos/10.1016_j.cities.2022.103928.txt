                  The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for rapid transformation towards a more sustainable society, particularly for cities and urban areas. There is a wide spectrum of research which could inform the initiation and management of this urban transformation, but these contributions are found in disparate disciplines and academic fields. This study aims to synthesise the different elements of the ‘Urban Transformation’ (UT) literature into a format which can inform the implementation of the SDGs. Using a systematic qualitative review methodology, the study identified 5150 potentially relevant papers. An extensive screening process was conducted to form a review corpus of 323 studies, upon which an interpretative, iterative content analysis was applied. The analysis resulted in 15 ‘factors of urban transformation’ identified across the literature. These factors are a mix of mechanisms and enablers which are all identified in the literature as critical for urban transformation to occur or continue. By providing a link between the rich urban transformation literature and SDG implementation, the results of this review could be used to explore the transformative potential of current approaches to SDG implementation, or as an initial tool to design new and more transformative pathways to achieve the SDGs in cities.

From climate change to depleting natural resources to social inequity, there is wide front of immediate and interlocking threats to lives and livelihoods (Sachs et al., 2019 ; Broman & Robèrt, 2017 ; UN, 2016 ). The urgent need for collective action in response to these challenges is reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs are a UN agenda intended to provide states, the private sector and civil society with an ambitious vision for a more sustainable future (UN, 2016 ). Embedded within the SDGs is the need for swift and radical action, with the agenda explicitly calling for “transformative goals…transformative vision… [and] structural transformation” (UN, 2015 ). Society is facing a multiplicity of challenges, and the SDGs call for transformative action to address them. The urgent sustainability challenges which the SDGs are focused on are particularly relevant for cities and urban areas. The economies, production and consumption that occur within urban areas are a driving force behind many modern sustainability challenges, such as greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss, food-energy-water insecurity, among a variety of others (Iwaniec et al., 2019 ; McCormick et al., 2013 ). With the world becoming increasingly urbanised – 68 % of the global population is expected to be urban dwellers by 2050 – the unsustainability of urban life will only become more pronounced (UN, 2019 ). This increasing contribution of urban populations to ongoing unsustainability necessitates cities themselves taking bold and rapid action towards a more sustainable condition. Not only is this needed out of a sense of ethical responsibility – that they should contribute to addressing an issue that they have an outsize effect on – but also because of the potential for substantial change within urban areas. The nature and composition of cities, from the significant amounts of capital to the presence and intersections between different types of actors, provides rich conditions for wide reaching change (Wolfram et al., 2016 ). This dual role of cities as both a major contributor to unsustainability as well as a potential prospect to foster rapid change towards sustainability, is emphasised in the SDGs themselves with one of the goals (SDG 11) explicitly relating to cities, and urban issues being embedded throughout the agenda in various other goals, such as ‘Sustainable Consumption and Production’ (SDG12) and ‘Climate Action’ (SDG 13) (ICLEI, 2016 ; SDSN, 2016 ). Even before the SDG agenda was ratified in 2015, there has been a growing focus in the academic literature about how urban areas can be transformed towards the broader objectives of sustainable development (McCormick et al., 2013 ). This focus has generated a significant level of discussion, collaboration and cross-pollination between a number of research fields and scholarly communities; creating a stream of literature explicitly engaging with ‘urban transformation’ (UT). This literature stream is primarily focussed on studying how and why urban areas can be rapidly and substantially transformed to become more sustainable and equitable (Wolfram, 2016b ; Wolfram & Frantzeskaki, 2016 ). This general objective of the UT literature makes it an ideal candidate to inform action towards the SDGs in cities, potentially providing the knowledge to help facilitate the urban transformation required to achieve the ambitious agenda. There are challenges in engaging with the UT literature though. The empirical observations and theoretical contributions which form the UT literature are drawn from a variety of academic disciplines and fields, ranging from ‘sustainability transitions’ to ‘urban planning’ and ‘urban ecology’ (Koch et al., 2017 ). These disparate fields have partially different or even unique interpretations of the impetus to transform, the object of transformation and the intended effects of transformation (Iwaniec et al., 2019 ). This variety also results in a wide diversity of frameworks and conceptual models being utilised, depending on what is commonly used in the respective fields (Wolfram & Frantzeskaki, 2016 ). The diversity in discipline, approach and method results in the UT literature being conceptually rich with insight into how UT can be fostered, but also being somewhat fragmented (Iwaniec et al., 2019 ). In order to explore and interpret the divergent contributions, a number of literature reviews of the UT literature have been conducted. The bibliometric characteristics of the literature have been mapped by Koch et al. (2017) , in order to identify the journal, year and geographical foci of UT publications. The emergent epistemologies, disciplines and conceptual frameworks that are common in the UT literature have been tracked and identified by both Wolfram and Frantzeskaki (2016)  and Wolfram et al. (2016) . These reviews provide an important initial insight into the UT literature but they are primarily focussed on explicating the characteristics and dynamics of the literature itself – such as how many studies are being published on the topic or from which discipline they are being drawn from – rather than exploring the phenomena of UT itself, that is, how UT can be catalysed or managed in practice. This study aims to identify the factors which are important for UT to occur in practice by synthesising the existing literature on urban transformation. A ‘systematic qualitative review’ methodology will be used to identify high-level factors that are common in cases of UT, regardless of the differing contexts in which they occur. The aim and ambition of this paper is framed with the explicit intention that the factors can then be used to inform UT in the context of SDG action, whilst acknowledging that the exact way that SDGs are/will be implemented in cities varies in different contexts.  2 Conceptual framing of UT The Urban Transformation literature employs perspectives from a wide variety of different disciplines. This rich diversity results in a similarly broad number of ways that UT is conceptualised and defined with the models/theories/concepts of the disciplines used to analyse UT in different ways. Because of the variation in discipline and approach, there is currently no unified conceptualisation or definition of UT in the literature (Maassen & Galvin, 2019 ; Wolfram et al., 2016 ), although Iwaniec et al. (2019)  have gone some way to offering initial characteristics which constitute UT. However, there is some coherence developing around a number of particularly visible studies. Highly-cited within the UT literature, these studies offer varying conceptualisations of what UT is and how it can be approached. In their ‘perspective’ paper on sustainability and resilience for transformation, Elmqvist et al. (2019)  respond to the need for transformation in cities – using the SDG agenda as a frame for this transformation - and attempt to contribute a clear definition for a number of contested urban concepts. More specifically, the authors argue that the terms ‘urban sustainability’, ‘urban resilience’ and UT are applied vaguely and often interchangeably and a more integrated understanding of each concept is needed. In order to address this deficiency, they provide a potential definition for UT, that it is “a systemic change of the urban system… a process of fundamental irreversible changes in infrastructures, ecosystems, agency configurations, lifestyles, systems of service provision, urban innovation, institutions and governance” (Elmqvist et al., 2019 , p. 269). In addition to this concrete definition, Elmqvist and colleagues also suggest how UT could be considered to occur and its function in relation to both urban sustainability and resilience. The authors argue that as urban systems are complex and adaptive, they should be conceived as having multiple different potential trajectories. These trajectories are directly influenced by the tolerance and resilience of an urban system to external disturbances or change. As such, the ability of an urban system to continue on one trajectory is a function of that systems resilience, but this does not necessarily mean that these trajectories have an innately high level of sustainability. The authors suggest that this is how UT should be considered, as the way that the trajectories of urban systems can be shifted so that they are enduring but also more sustainable. This can occur via  a directed transformation (which has an element of proactivity and intention) or abrupt transformation (which is typically in response to unforeseen shocks to the system) but the authors suggest that to be considered UT, the trajectory of an urban system has to be fundamentally altered to become more sustainable. Pickett et al. (2013)  take an ecological science approach to sustainable urban transformation. They conceptually seek to integrate and consolidate a variety of academic perspectives including ecological sustainability, urban design and urban change around the concept of UT (Pickett et al., 2013 ). The authors establish that rapid change is needed to make the ongoing urbanization occurring around the globe much more sustainable, but that there are a variety of different ways that that change can be theorised. They suggest that there are a number of different ‘modes’ that a city can be in depending on its purpose, form and drivers. These modes include mercantile, industrial, sanitary and consumer. The authors frame the current challenge of unsustainable urbanization as the need to transition from a sanitary or consumer city – depending on how far ‘developed’ the city is – to a ‘sustainable city’. This ‘transformation’ as the authors term it, can be driven by a variety of processes and triggers which are dependent on the context and needs of the city in question. It is this diversity of ways that change towards urban sustainability can occur in cities that prompt the authors to frame UT as a relational concept dependent on what situation a city is transforming towards a more sustainable state from. As such, UT can only really be identified as the result of any particular urban change towards sustainability, essentially acting as a measure of the significance of the change the city has undergone in relation to the starting point. Finally, Wolfram (2016a)  has conceptualised the notion of urban transformative capacity. This review paper canvases the studies in the literature which engage with ‘urban transformative capacity’ and develops an integrated conceptual framework which combines these varying contributions. The author states that a variety of the fields/disciplines that engage with UT explicitly refer to an enabling, pre-development stage before UT has actually occurred. This stage prepares, facilitates and allows UT of some kind to subsequently occur. The exact configuration of the stage varies depending on the city of interest but the author found that it is typically influenced by agency, place and context. The author does not consider UT capacity to be a direct example of UT, as it is a precursor to subsequent transformative change, but the framing of UT in this article does extend the conceptualisation of UT to include both observable UT and the conditions which allow that change to occur. These studies – and how they conceptualise UT – go some way to demonstrate the variety of ways that UT is approached in the literature. Contributions from other perspectives, such as conceptualizing UT as a subsection of sustainability transitions, as a measurement tool for the urban metabolism or as a collaborative goal for trans-disciplinary research (among a variety of other conceptualisations), underscore that there is a significant number of differing interpretations of UT (Ernst et al., 2016 ; Huang et al., 2015 ; Smith & Jenkins, 2015 ). However, there are a number of common characteristics which are observable across the variety of conceptualisations of UT which are useful to frame this review, these being; impact, timescale and intentionality. These characteristics are specifically identified in Iwaniec et al. (2019)  and are observed by the authors of this review in prominent UT studies and across the UT literature in general. 2.1 Impact One of the more prominent characteristics of UT in the literature is that transformational urban change demonstrates ‘fundamental’ change to the urban system in question (Elmqvist et al., 2019 ). The precise interpretation of ‘fundamental’ varies between authors but the general consensus is that this relates to significant or radical changes to the system properties itself, rather than minor or progressive change (Elmqvist et al., 2019 ; Iwaniec et al., 2019 ). In the previous examples, significant impact was framed as: “fundamental… [and] large scale” in Elmqvist et al. (2019) , “radical… [and] fundamental” in Pickett et al. (2013) , and as “radical” in Wolfram (2016a) .  2.2 Timescale Another common feature of UT relates to the temporalities of urban change. The common interpretation of this timescale for transformation is that it should be some form of ‘ongoing’ change and that it should persist after it has been created. Essentially, the change to the system properties endures into the medium-term, rather than being a brief aberration (Iwaniec et al., 2019 ). In the previous examples this is characterised as change that is “irreversible” in Elmqvist et al. (2019)  and “ongoing” in Pickett et al. (2013)  (it was not defined as such in Wolfram (2016a)  due to that studies focus on the pre-conditions for change).  2.3 Intentionality The intention behind a transformation is another important characteristic of UT. Scholars consider UT as intentionally created/aligned towards the goal of sustainability or sustainable development (Maassen & Galvin, 2019 ). In the previous examples, this characteristic was defined as “directed” in Elmqvist et al. (2019)  (although the authors do acknowledge other ‘abrupt’ transformations as well), “positive… [and] informed by sustainability” in Pickett et al. (2013)  and as “initiated… [to] drive sustainability” in Wolfram (2016a) . However, intentionality is somewhat contentious within the literature with some arguing that unintended transformations that result in positive effects for sustainable development should still be considered as examples of UT (Iwaniec et al., 2019 ; Wolfram et al., 2016 ). For this review, UT will be conceptualised as an intentional process in order to align the review with urban SDG initiatives, which are intentionally designed and initiated (SDSN, 2016 ). These three characteristics help to form a working definition of UT for this study; that it refers to fundamental and ongoing changes to an urban system/s that contributes or is aligned towards sustainable development. Institutions, infrastructure, ecosystems and governance are common examples of these ‘urban system/s’ which can be transformed (Elmqvist et al., 2019 ; Pereira et al., 2018 ) but this is not exclusive, and other, alternative systems can undergo UT as well. This tentative definition helps to guide what constitutes UT, but it primarily relates to the ‘transformation’ element of UT, and not the ‘urban’ element. As with the variety of ways that the change that constitutes UT can be conceptualised, the surrounding urban context/environment within which it occurs can also be interpreted differently. For example, a city can be defined as an area, an agent, a network, a commons or an organism, among a variety of others (Halla et al., 2020 ; Wolfram, 2016b ). Some studies and institutions specifically define cities based upon their population – 50,000 or 100,000 inhabitants being a common threshold – whereas others use the administrative delineation or population density of a particular area (UN-Habitat, 2018 ; Marcotullio & Solecki, 2013 ). Due to the variety of characteristics which can and are used to define a city, this study will not use a specific, quantitative definition. Rather, the ‘urban’ element of UT (the unit of analysis) will be considered as more of an abstract evocation of any urban environment where communities live and work, and where transformation can occur, in order to ensure that a variety of contexts and perspectives on what constitutes a city are included. It should be acknowledged that the studies reviewed and other contributions to the UT literature may conceptualise it in an alternative or more definite way.   3 Methodology This study is designed as a ‘systematic qualitative review’ of all recent academic articles which engage with UT in practice. ‘Systematic qualitative review’ has a number of interpretations but this study uses the interpretation suggested by Grant & Booth, 2009 , that it should consist of a ‘structured and comprehensive search process coupled with a qualitative content analysis process’ (Grant & Booth, 2009 ). There is an ongoing debate in the literature about how systematic the search process should be and the value of the time/effort investment needed for a full systematic search if the results are not to be statistically aggregated together (Booth, 2006 ; Grant & Booth, 2009 ). Due to the amorphous characteristics of the UT literature (and the concept itself), a definite search strategy for deductive investigation is difficult to adopt and would be incongruent with the exploratory, inductive content analysis. As such, this study will draw on the suggestion of Dixon-Woods et al. (2006)  that the search strategy should be as defined as is judged necessary by the researcher to encompass the major elements of the topic and achieve conceptual saturation. Therefore, the study selection stage only used broad selection criteria before a more intensive screening process was employed. Finally, an iterative process of qualitative content analysis was used. The methodological process is illustrated in Fig. 1  . 3.1 Database search The first stage of the review process involved a key word search of the Scopus academic database. In order to ensure that a wide variety of UT-related literature was reviewed, the key terms used were kept very broad. Aligning with the general features of UT discussed previously, the keywords focused on cities, transformation and sustainability. As such broad search terms were used, it was decided that only one database would be searched so that the scoping process did not become unreasonably protracted. ‘Scopus’ was selected as the database because of its high level of indexing and high coverage of a variety of disciplines (as UT studies can be from a variety of backgrounds; Mongeon & Paul-Hus, 2016 ; Harzing & Alakangas, 2016 ). 3.1.1 Search terms The search terms used were ‘cities’, ‘city’, ‘urban’, ‘transform’, ‘transition’, ‘sustainability’ and ‘sustainable’.  3.1.2 Selection criteria As with the search terms, the selection criteria for the database search were kept broad to ensure a diverse corpus. The time period was specified to 2010–2020. This time period in particular was selected as Koch et al. (2017)  suggest that it is during this time that the UT literature stream began to develop and the cross-pollination between disciplines on the topic began to occur. The language of the studies was limited to English. Whilst this was necessary as that is the primary language of the authors, it should be noted that there may be some perspectives – particularly from the Global South – which could be omitted because of this necessity. Most study formats were included except for ‘book reviews’, ‘notes’, ‘surveys’ and ‘erratum’ as it was judged that the rich information/discussion needed to describe a UT factor would not be present in these formats.   3.2 Screening Due to the broad search terms, a rigorous screening process was undertaken. This was to ensure that the papers in the corpus were aligned with the general interpretation of UT previously discussed; that it is fundamental, ongoing and intended/oriented towards advancing sustainable development, rather than just describing any form of change occurring in an urban area. 3.2.1 Inclusion criteria That the urban change described in the study be:- Of a significant impact (as much as can be understood from the study).  - Ongoing into the future (as much as can be understood/predicted from the study).  - Aligned/contribute towards sustainable development.  - Be drawn (at least in part) from some form of empirical case study.    The first three inclusion criteria are intended to screen and select studies which align with this review's working definition of UT, whilst the fourth is to ensure that the results are relevant in a practical context. The ‘impact’ related criterion was included to select only studies which display urban change which is ‘radical’ or ‘significant’, as previously discussed in Section 2 . A discrete measure of significance was not used because of the variety of focuses/topics in the corpus. For example, comparison between a significant change in an urban governance configuration and a significant change in urban infrastructure provision is difficult to unify into a single measure. Rather, the descriptions used to describe the change – such as powerful, important, far-reaching, critical, etc.  – and the description of the context preceding the change were used to broadly judge the general level of change. The ‘ongoing’ criterion was included to select studies where the transformative change continues, in alignment with the timescale element of this study's UT definition. This can be difficult to concretely determine for many studies, unless they are specifically designed as a pre-post investigation, so this criterion was approached flexibly. If the urban change investigated continued for 3 or more years, it was automatically treated as fulfilling this criterion. If the authors of the study explicitly noted that the transformative change did not continue after it had occurred, it was treated as not fulfilling this criterion. For studies where neither of these conditions were fulfilled, the researchers used the context and discussion within the study to broadly judge the likelihood of continuation, with marginal studies included to ensure a broad corpus. The ‘alignment/contribution’ criterion was included to ensure that the phrase ‘sustainability’ was used in the same context as the working definition of UT. Sustainable development is broadly seen as the balancing of ‘three pillars’ – environmental, social and economic – and is used as a guiding, normative principal to underpin the SDG agenda (UN, 2016 ). As such, if the transformative change improved ‘sustainability’ in relation to one or all of these elements, it was included in the review corpus. For example, a study describing the fiscal viability of a firm could be captured if it is framed as ‘financial sustainability’. However, it would not align with the normative goal of sustainable development so would not be included. Due to the large corpus size, the screening process was conducted in two parts. First, the title and abstract of all the database results were reviewed. Second, the studies remaining after the title/abstract screen underwent a full text screen. The same inclusion criteria were used in both parts. A general quality check was also conducted during the full text screening, to ensure that the studies were of a reasonable standard, had logical methodologies and understandable content.   3.3 Factor development This study used a variation of the ‘interpretive synthesis’ (IS) method in order analyse and draw insights from the review corpus. Closely aligned with meta-ethnographies, grounded theory-based reviews and systematic reviews, IS seeks to integrate the findings of studies for the purpose of theory/concept building (Dixon-Woods et al., 2006 ; Flemming, 2010 ). It is rooted in the qualitative form of literature review (Annandale et al., 2007 ) – although it can draw from both qualitative and quantitative studies – and is both dynamic and reflexive, the synthesis continuing until conceptual saturation is reached within the corpus to achieve the review's aim (McIntyre et al., 2016 ). There are a variety of specific methodologies which can be used for an IS but this study used an adaptation of the broad methodology suggested by Dixon-Woods et al. (2006) , a seminal IS paper. This methodology involves- A detailed inspection of all corpus papers.  - A gradual identification of recurring elements, patterns and categories in the literature.  - The generation of broad themes that are re-occurring or emergent in the literature.  - Continual comparison of the themes and theoretical structures developed back to the literature.  - Iteration of the themes as the corpus is re-explored.    More specifically, the IS method was used for this study as a way to generate the theory/concepts that the corpus could then be systematically reviewed for. As suggested by McFerran et al. (2016) , an early iterative synthesis can then be used for subsequent stages of review. As can be seen in Fig. 1 , an iterative process was taken to initially identify the 15 factors from the review corpus. The papers were inspected, and emergent themes in how/why the transformative change described within them was occurring, was coded for. These codes were then grouped into broad themes, based on their shared characteristics or relationship to transformation, with these themes then being formatted into ‘factors’. The relationship between the codes and the factors is illustrated in further detail in Appendices B and C . The papers were then reinspected and the context/framing of the identified factors was explored to ensure that they were in fact important for the transformative change, as suggested by Annandale et al. (2007) . This process was repeated until 15 factors important for UT to occur in practice were synthesised from the corpus.

As this process was repeated a number of times, it ultimately occurred in a number of stages. Stage 1: General inspection/coding of all corpus papers for any emergent themes. At this time, no specific target or topic was focussed on, with the framing of ‘UT factors’ not yet decided, and cases of transformation not specifically targeted. Frequently occurring codes were the only output of this round. A more detailed explanation of this stage and the themes/factors identified in it is available in Appendix C .

Frequently occurring codes were the only output of this round. A more detailed explanation of this stage and the themes/factors identified in it is available in Appendix C. Stage 2: Another round of inspection/coding of all corpus papers for elements that were ‘important’ (no specific metrics were used to measure this importance, the identification/discussion of its importance by the respective study's authors was considered sufficient) for the UT case described in each of the studies in the corpus. Frequently occurring codes of phenomena identified as important for the cases of UT described in the papers was the output of this round. A more detailed explanation of this stage and the themes/factors identified in it is available in Appendix C .

A more detailed explanation of this stage and the themes/factors identified in it is available in Appendix C. Stage 3: A final round of inspection/coding of all corpus papers to ensure no codes/themes were missed in the large corpus and that it could be judged that conceptual saturation had been achieved. Frequently occurring codes of phenomena identified as important for the cases of UT described in the papers was again the output of this round. A more detailed explanation of this stage and the themes/factors identified in it is available in Appendix C .

A more detailed explanation of this stage and the themes/factors identified in it is available in Appendix C. Stage 4: A post-coding stage in which the codes were grouped together into a number of themes based on shared characteristics or relationship to UT. This grouping was begun during the coding process (that is, that similarities between the codes were noted as coding was conducted) but the formal grouping was conducted after the three coding stages. The broad themes were then formatted into factors, whilst keeping as much of the diversity and nuance of the codes as possible. The codes, themes and factors are listed in full in Appendix B . Three themes identified in the coding process were judged in this stage not to be appropriate to include in the results because of either a low incidence rate, inaccurate framing in the coding process, or overlap with other factors (or a combination thereof). A more detailed explanation of this decision is available in Appendix C . Stage 4: A post-coding stage in which the codes were grouped together into a number of themes based on shared characteristics or relationship to UT. This grouping was begun during the coding process (that is, that similarities between the codes were noted as coding was conducted) but the formal grouping was conducted after the three coding stages. The broad themes were then formatted into factors, whilst keeping as much of the diversity and nuance of the codes as possible. The codes, themes and factors are listed in full in Appendix B. Three themes identified in the coding process were judged in this stage not to be appropriate to include in the results because of either a low incidence rate, inaccurate framing in the coding process, or overlap with other factors (or a combination thereof). A more detailed explanation of this decision is available in Appendix C. Once the UT factors had been synthesised, the entire corpus was then re-analysed to map the presence of the 15 factors in each of the studies, in order to understand their incidence and occurrence.   4 Results The IS process resulted in a number of frequently occurring themes being identified in the review corpus. These themes were distilled into a number of factors which are commonly found across the variety of UT cases present in the literature. The 15 factors can be seen in Fig. 2  and are explained in more detail in Section 4.1 . The frequency with which they were present in the review corpus is graphed in Fig. 3 . A full list of the corpus papers and the factors identified in them is available in the Appendix .

A full list of the corpus papers and the factors identified in them is available in the Appendix. 4.1 Description of the 15 factors 4.1.1 Strong grassroots engagement and/or support   A factor which intersects with many facets of UT, from design to implementation to continuation. Sometimes referred to as ‘bottom-up engagement’ – such as in Fastenrath and Preller (2018)  – or as ‘citizen engagement’ – such as in Calder and Beckie (2011)  – this factor essentially involves embedding the wishes and visions of the broader community that the transformation will affect, into the entire process. Across the corpus, this factor is generally considered important because the local community and grassroots backing can help support and sustain a transformation after it has occurred. This kind of positive assistance may be in the form of direct maintenance of the transformation, encouraging broader community uptake of the transformed element or a better navigation of any potential negative side-effects (Radywyl & Bigg, 2013 ). Another important effect of this factor is how it can impact the actor/stakeholder dynamic of an UT. Grassroots engagement can help to reduce the power-imbalances between stakeholders or ‘cut through’ the usual method of operation for institutional actors, creating new and more innovative methods and perspectives (Fernández et al., 2016 ; Menny et al., 2018 ).  4.1.2 Experimentation across policy, capacity and actors A factor which emphasises iteration and innovation in order to spur and continue UT. This factor is discussed in a variety of contexts/framings in the corpus but the primary manner is as a mechanism to catalyse transformation. By experimenting with different approaches, an initiative can be progressively designed for that specific context, creating an ongoing transformation (van Steenbergen & Frantzeskaki, 2018 ; Williams, 2016 ). Essentially, experimentation is framed as a way to design an initiative to catalyse transformative results although, the exact way in which it is conducted and implemented varies across the corpus. Some studies advocate explicitly for ‘urban living labs’, specific sites that allow stakeholders to design, test and learn from different innovations (von Wirth et al., 2019 ). Others call for approaching urban sustainability with a more ‘experimental mindset’, approaching the design of any particular initiative with an experimental and iterative approach (Hölscher et al., 2019 ). Regardless of the exact framing, a consistent theme in the corpus is that experimentation is an important way to both design and manage UT. It should be noted that this is only how experimentation is framed in the UT literature, the discussion of experimentation in the broader literature could be significantly different or more nuanced.  4.1.3 Changes to community/consumer behaviour A factor which strengthens and reinforces a transformation after it has occurred. This factor is typically described as the local community embracing and adopting the transformation as part of their life, therefore embedding it into the surrounding environment (Bruckmeier & Pires, 2018 ; Santala & McGuirk, 2019 ). UT can be sparked but it needs some form of fostering for it to be continued, otherwise it may revert to the previous state or even potentially produce negative side-effects (Lam et al., 2020 ). The corpus generally discusses behaviour change in the context of the physical environment, such as the installation of new infrastructure and the community changing their typical habits to utilise that new infrastructure, with a particular emphasis on transformation in mobility infrastructure, such as in Frändberg and Vilhelmson (2010) . By considering behaviour change, the UT can be become part of community life and its benefits realised for local residents.  4.1.4 Ongoing investment in the area A factor which provides the resources needed to catalyse and continue UT. This factor is typically described as a supportive element, allowing for other UT factors to be incorporated and addressed (Darchen, 2020 ; Xiao et al., 2020 ). Some elements of creating transformation can be costly or resource intensive when compared to non-transformative alternatives, examples being experimentation or stakeholder collaboration (Borgström, 2019 ). Continued investment allows for these elements to be fully utilised and therefore, the likelihood of UT occurring to be increased. Similarly, this factor is also discussed in the corpus as a way of ensuring that the UT becomes established, allowing for any additional monitoring/adjustment and giving the actors involved flexibility with its maintenance (Bayulken & Huisingh, 2015 ; Tsenkova, 2018 ).  4.1.5 Openness towards innovation and change A factor which relates to the mindset/perception/approach of the actors involved in the process of transformation. At most stages of UT – whether that be before, during or after a transformation has occurred – there is likely to be a significant level of change, as change is inherent in transformation. Generally, if the actors/coalitions involved with the UT are more open and comfortable with that change, UT is more likely to be catalysed or continued (Green et al., 2016 ; Scholl et al., 2018 ). This openness is seen in a variety of formats across the corpus but it is typically seen in relation to experimentation during the design of a UT initiative (Charli-Joseph et al., 2018 ; Nevens et al., 2013 ), the governance configuration to manage a transformation (Spijker & Parra, 2018 ), or a broader openness to innovation/change being embedded throughout each/any element of UT to create an environment that enables transformation to occur.  4.1.6 Use of foresight tools and development of shared future narratives A factor which creates a sense of temporality among actors for UT. Exact timescales may vary between different cases of UT but engaging with future scenarios and embedding foresight into the UT process has a variety of positive effects. Some studies explicitly advocate for foresight tools to be used during the design of a transformative initiative as a way of improving its alignment with the local area and increasing its resilience to potential future shocks (McPhearson et al., 2016 ). This use essentially frames foresight as a tool that can be used by the actors (Accastello et al., 2019 ). Another interpretation of this factor is that it is a valuable approach to develop cohesion and unity among the actors involved with the UT (Holden et al., 2016 ; Wiese et al., 2014 ). Developing a shared vision for the area – and for the transformation – among those involved can help to align their interests and create a sense of inspiration and identity during the potentially difficult process of fostering UT (Lillevold & Haarstad, 2019 ). Other studies advocate for engagement with futures/foresight throughout the UT process as a way of enabling other important factors of UT. By engaging with future scenarios, a more participatory approach may be fostered, complexity and uncertainty could be better managed and social learning/innovation between actors could be encouraged (Eames et al., 2013 ; Goldstein et al., 2015 ).  4.1.7 Collaboration and co-creation between different actors/stakeholders A factor which relates to the capabilities and coalitions of actors typically needed to create UT. Whilst transformation can be spurred by a variety of different types of actors working in different configurations, UT is more commonly spurred by diverse coalitions of actors cooperatively working to create a transformation together (de Koning et al., 2019 ). Resources, knowledge/insight and effort can be shared to create a result that is greater than any one of the actors could likely create alone (de Koning et al., 2019 ; Mulder, 2018 ). An alternative interpretation in the corpus is that the process of collaboration and co-creation can be transformative in its own right, creating working partnerships, coalitions of actors and transformation pathways that would not have occurred without working together as part of the process (Larson et al., 2014 ). Beyond the potential benefits that collaboration or co-creation can create, both are also important to ensure that both the process and outcome of transformation is just and equitable (Charli-Joseph et al., 2018 ). By meaningfully working with a variety of actors, it is more likely that a participatory and inclusive approach will be used, allowing the community/actors who will be affected by the transformation to have some agency in its design and management (Charli-Joseph et al., 2018 ).  4.1.8 Open participation in the process A factor which focuses on the diversity of actors involved and the level of input they have into the UT process. Creating and managing UT typically involves a variety of actors but in most circumstances, there will be a group of actors who are impacted by the transformation but are not directly involved in the decision making for its creation or management. The corpus emphasises the importance of still involving these people/groups in the transformation process (Calder & Beckie, 2011 ; Gedik & Yildiz, 2016 ). This involvement is often framed as a way of providing richer insight into the surrounding environment, potentially resulting in an initiative which is better suited to the context or more likely to create transformation (Bina & Ricci, 2016 ; Menny et al., 2018 ). Essentially, that participation increases the data available when creating the transformation. There is another strong emphasis that participation is essential to ensure that the UT process is not autocratic and there is some recourse for those not in direct control of the process (Bennett et al., 2019 ). Some studies in the corpus take this perspective further, suggesting that participation not only helps give voice to the community affected by the transformation, but also challenges the assumptions/perceptions of those ‘with’ the power, or helps them to better learn and understand the surrounding context (Frantzeskaki & Rok, 2018 ; Kasala & Smatanova, 2019 ).  4.1.9 ‘Champion’ change agents/leaders A factor which engages with the difficulty of both starting and continuing UT. The resources, effort and activities which are needed to create transformation – including many of the factors listed in this section - create a significant barrier to generating UT. This factor reflects that this difficulty is often overcome by leaders – whether they be individuals, groups, institutions or coalitions – championing the change (Mendizabal et al., 2018 ; Mukhtar-Landgren et al., 2019 ). Their advocacy can spur the initial development/catalyst of the UT or their ongoing support and leadership can ensure that the UT continues and isn't extinguished (Block & Paredis, 2013 ; Mukhtar-Landgren et al., 2019 ). In the corpus there are examples of this from both powerful, institutional leaders and from sustained, grassroots leaders (Block & Paredis, 2013 ; Kitheka et al., 2016 ).  4.1.10 Openness to learning and knowledge sharing (between actors) A factor which relates to the reflexive and iterative learning that is often required for UT. As complexity, uncertainty and context-specificity are inherent in most UT, ongoing learning and tentation is usually needed for any specific transformation (Greyling et al., 2017 ; Ofei-Manu et al., 2017 ). Many of the factors found in this review – particularly experimentation and openness to innovation – explicitly require iteration and progressive learning. Openness to this type of ongoing learning is cited in the corpus as an important step to increase the likelihood that the right transformation for the area will be generated but also that the whole UT process remains flexible, adaptable and able to change (Greyling et al., 2017 ).  4.1.11 Ongoing monitoring and data collection A factor which engages with the uncertainty of UT. Due to the interrelation between different systems and actors, the exact effects of transformation can be difficult to predict. This level of inherent uncertainty requires ongoing data collection, in order to ensure that the intended effect is occurring or that unintended effects are positive (Laprise et al., 2018 ; Nevens et al., 2013 ). This type of monitoring is closely aligned with the previously discussed ‘experimentation’ factor as that form of iteration is best informed by rich and ongoing data collection (Nevens et al., 2013 ; Scholl et al., 2018 ). The foresight and shared future narratives factor also often requires robust monitoring – to identify if the UT is in alignment with those future narratives/scenarios – although not all foresight activities/techniques necessarily require this form of data collection (Allen et al., 2016 ).  4.1.12 Flexible regulatory/planning regime A factor which relates to the level of disruption and novelty that UT can often demonstrate. By its very nature, UT may not easily fit within the regulatory or planning regime of an area. Its rapid growth could be incongruous with lengthy approval processes, its scope may fall between various regulatory institutions or it may contradict local policies entirely (Filion et al., 2015 ; Wasnadi & Ellisa, 2019 ). Flexibility in these regimes and structures prevents UT from being stifled but also ensures that there is some level of protection if the transformation has any negative effects (Elmqvist et al., 2018 ; Leck et al., 2018 ; Pelling & Manuel-Navarrete, 2011 ). The corpus typically emphasises the regulatory/planning regime in relation to urban renewal but similar suggestions are present for other topics such as transformation in smart city initiatives, utility infrastructure and creative/cultural production (Dong et al., 2012 ; Gainza, 2018 ; Johnson et al., 2011 ).  4.1.13 Strong local identity A factor which addresses the context specificity of UT and both its positive and negative effects on transformative outcomes. If UT occurs in an area with particularly unique characteristics and the transformation aligns with that identity, the transformation can become reinforced and amplified by that culture (Sepe, 2014 ; Swensen & Skrede, 2018 ). This can apply in different ways depending on the context but community uptake, perception and support are frequently referred to (Ferilli et al., 2017 ; Radywyl & Bigg, 2013 ). This factor is interrelated with a number of other factors – such as grassroots engagement, ongoing monitoring and openness to innovation/change – with consideration of local identity and culture being cited in the corpus as important across all of the stages of the UT process (Ferilli et al., 2017 ; Sepe, 2014 ; Wirth et al., 2018 ).  4.1.14 Political institutional support A factor which relates to the support that a UT process often requires to flourish. As has been previously discussed, UT processes can be disruptive and costly (although this is not necessarily always the case). The risk of actors engaging with the process and giving resources, time or attention to it for possibly little return can be reduced by the support of high-level institutional actors which wield some form of power or authority (Kronsell & Mukhtar-Landgren, 2018 ). This support gives the process legitimacy and is cited frequently in the corpus as a potential indication that the process of developing the transformation will have the attention and resources needed to be successful (or at least, that institutions have the power to provide this) (Bridges, 2016 ; Dobson, 2019 ; Mukhtar-Landgren et al., 2019 ; Radywyl & Bigg, 2013 ). Essentially, this is another form of support that is similar to the ‘champion change agent’ but which acts at a broader scale. However, some studies in the corpus refer to institutional support as a possible inhibiter of transformation as the involvement of such established actors may reduce the likelihood of radical transformations in favour of reproducing the status quo (Dobson, 2019 ). Regardless of its possible positive or negative effects, the support of institutions must be managed carefully for UT to occur.  4.1.15 Inter-stakeholder trust A factor which reinforces the importance of a strong coalition to create and continue UT. As has been previously discussed, complexity and uncertainty are inherent for much UT. This can place a strain on the various actors involved in the transformation, especially if there are power dynamics or conflicting agendas between then. Trust in the motives and reliability of each of the actors is frequently cited as an important element to ensure that the partnerships and coalitions that manage the UT process are strong, open and cooperative (Dupont et al., 2015 ; Hartig & Wallace, 2015 ). A base level of trust is also important because it allows for robust contestation between actors, pushing the perspectives and approaches of each actor into a more innovative space without jeopardising the strength of the coalition (Frantzeskaki & Rok, 2018 ; Wolfram, 2019 ).    5 Discussion 5.1 The factors The factors presented previously are intended to give an initial insight into what is important for UT to occur in practice. It should be noted that they are not an exhaustive list, with additional UT factors likely to be identified with further research in a broader array of contexts. Similarly, the factors are not prescriptive, not all are necessarily required for UT to occur and all of the cases reviewed in this study demonstrated some form of transformation without all of the factors being present (the highest number of factors present in a single study was 9, whilst the lowest amount was 1). Both of these clarifications are a result of the studies research design. The review does not attempt to assess the relationship between the presence/absence of any of the factors and the presence/absence - or relative level - of transformation. The factors are identified and discussed as being important for that particular case of UT, but there is no threshold placed on how many factors must be present, how they affect transformation or the level of causality that can be attributed between them. There is some variation in the incidence of the factors with ‘collaboration and co-creation between different actors/stakeholders’ being the most identified with an incidence of 93 and ‘ongoing investment in the area’ being the least identified at 30. However, this does not necessarily mean that these factors result in different levels of transformation or that a causal link between any one factor and UT can be established from this incidence. Rather than being a discrete or definitive link to transformation, they are simply common elements present in cases of UT documented in the literature. Despite all being commonly present in cases of UT, the factors have some diversity in the actual way that they act and influence the process of UT. Some are specifically relevant to the actors which are involved, and the coalitions and partnerships that they form to create change, the ‘strong grassroots engagement and/or support’ factor being an example of this. There are also factors such as ‘openness towards innovation and change’ which are centred on how the actors actually perceive and behave in relation to the UT process. Quite separate from actor-centric factors are other factors which interact differently, such as: factors which catalyse change (such as the involvement of ‘champion change agents/leaders’), the pre-existing characteristics of the place/context within which UT occurs (such as ‘strong local identity’), factors which help to continue and embed transformation once it has occurred (such as ‘ongoing investment in the area’) or mechanisms/tools which can be applied (such as the ‘use of foresight tools and development of shared future narratives’). Even further, some factors act across these general classifications depending on the context, an example being the ‘experimentation across policy, capacity and actors’ factor which in some cases can catalyse UT, or ongoing experimentation can allow for the flexibility to continue transformation after-the-fact. These examples are not indicative of definite categories of factors – there is not enough factors for each of the types discussed previously to concretely define them – but they are illustrative that the factors influence UT differently, and that they are broadly mechanisms, characteristics or actor dynamics.  5.2 The factors in combination and in practice The previous discussion highlighted that the factors can't be considered to be discrete or absolute, and this framing extends to how they work in practice as well. A common understanding in the urban literature is that radical change towards sustainability does not occur in a single pathway, particularly if it occurs across a variety of contexts and conditions. Depending on the actor's present, the local environment, external events and a range of other potential elements, there are wide variety of potential pathways that an urban area can take that would result in some form of transformation (Beland Lindahl et al., 2016 ; Elmqvist et al., 2019 ; Leach et al., 2010 ; Westley et al., 2011 ). Similarly, the factors identified in this review do not combine into a single, archetypal pathway across all of the cases reviewed. Across the corpus, there are a variety of different ways the factors combine in different contexts and conditions, although in some cases the factors didn't combine at all and were present individually. There are two prominent examples of these combinations in the review which help to illustrate these differences, although it should be noted that they are also not definitive and further investigation is needed to determine if they are significant/reoccurring combinations or if there are other common combinations of factors. The first combination of factors is when transformation is generated through brute force, when an urban area is forced to change and for its systems to be swiftly and radically changed. This ‘force’ can take a variety of forms - whether it be literally bulldozing buildings such as in the case of Kaczmarek (2019)  or building completely new structures such as in Haarstad and Oseland (2017)  - but it usually requires a top-down actor with authority in the area, such as a large government or major corporation, to use a significant level of resources to exert change. As such, the ‘political institutional support’ and ‘inter-stakeholder trust’ are usually combined given the need to involve policy makers and the trust of the local stakeholders/community to ensure that such substantial change is applied responsibly, such as in Hartig and Wallace (2015) . An alternative combination of factors is when a significant event occurs outside the urban area which causes rapid changes to the operating conditions of multiple systems simultaneously. Again, the exact form of this event can vary – it could be a swift event such as an earthquake such as in Xiao et al. (2020)  or a longer acting event like an economic recession such as in Pérez (2010)  – but it generates transformative change in response to it. Due to the fluidity needed to respond to such events, the ‘openness towards innovation and change’ factor is often required in order for novel responses to the shock to occur and the ‘flexible regulatory/planning regime’ factor is then important for institutions to act on these responses, this combination being present in Pérez (2010) . These two types of UT both result in transformation but that result is achieved through different combinations of factors. These differences between just two types of UT further illustrate the need to avoid conceptualizing the results of this review as a single pathway or that the way that the factors combine can be confidently used to indicate these pathways at this stage. The variety in characteristics, conditions and factors creates too much uncertainty for this review to begin to conceptualise the factors together, but it does create an opportunity for future work. With further investigation into how the factors work together, if they can work individually and in which conditions this occurs a more definite typology of these UT pathways could be developed and some form of integrated model of how UT occurs in practice could be based on how the factors combine and influence each other.  5.3 Limitations The results of any review are dependent on the review corpus they are drawn from but this is especially true for this study. UT implies a level of universality, as some form of transformation can theoretically occur in all cities. However, it's important to clarify that the results of this review are not necessarily directly applicable to all contexts because of the biases and limitations of the UT literature itself, particularly in relation to geographical and socio-cultural characteristics. This review did not exclude any country or context, but the authors noted somewhat of a euro-centricity to the corpus that this study relied on. The drivers and processes for change can be markedly different between cities in the Global North and the Global South and therefore approaches developed in the Global North – or in this case, developed using a potentially Global North slanted corpus - may be unhelpful in some Global South contexts (Nagendra et al., 2018 ). In addition to the contexts of the studies, the disciplines represented may also be limited and therefore important to consider for the results. Whilst, this review did not exclude any discipline from the analysis, the review could only utilise studies which explicitly used the language of transformation. It would have been prohibitively difficult given the already large corpus size to expand the search process with more search term variations but it is still true that there are likely studies and disciplines that engage with UT in some way that do not refer to it in these explicit terms, and consequently are not included in the review. As it is, the corpus has a significant number of papers from both the ‘sustainability transitions’ field and the ‘urban planning’ field. This is to be expected, as these fields are the most active in discussing and exploring UT (Wolfram, 2016b ) but it is an important characteristic to be mindful of if the factors are to be used to explore specific cases of UT. Each of these fields has a particular perspective – or perspectives – of the actors involved in UT, how they create change and the mechanisms which are used, which may not apply to all instances of UT. The factors are an initial way to engage with UT but it is important to iterate and critically modify them as they are explored in different contexts to identify if there are any potential blind spots as a result of the corpus composition.  5.4 Use of the factors and avenues for future research The factors identified in this review are a useful initial insight into how UT occurs but further work is needed to deepen and extend their use. Already in this Discussion  section, a number of possible avenues for future research have been suggested, the most straightforward of which is to expand the scope to even more contexts in order to identify a greater collection of factors. Another is to further explore the dynamics between the factors to further understand the variety of pathways that can create a transformative result in an urban area. However, the sheer amount and diversity of conditions in urban contexts around the globe make pursuing this kind of universal conceptualisation of UT incredibly challenging, if it is achievable at all. Perhaps a more achievable – and more immediately useful – future research direction is to explore this kind of conceptualisation within constrained contexts in order to limit this excess of variables. A logical setting for this would be in cities which are implementing the SDGs. Such cities still have significant diversity – the agenda is being implemented worldwide – but the implementation process would provide a certain structure within which the UT occurs. Each of these cities would have the same general starting point in 2015 (when the goals were ratified), the same ultimate objective to achieve the goals and likely the same desire for transformation towards the goals. These similarities would help to frame the process of UT and could provide a way to explore the factors and the pathways to transformation that they can form whilst still allowing for the diversity of urban life across the globe. Beyond using the context of SDG implementation to further understand how the factors combine in pathways of UT, the factors could also be more immediately used to explore and potentially improve existing SDG implementation. This could take a variety of forms depending on the status and progress of the particular city in implementing the goals. If a city has not yet begun to engage with the SDGs, the factors could be used to help inform that implementation to maximise the likelihood of transformation. They could help to suggest which actors are particularly important to involve or which mechanisms might be particularly advantageous to consider. This would not guarantee transformative results but it could help to increase the likelihood of that, especially if the factors are iterated and improved further. In cities which have begun to implement the agenda but for which tangible results haven't yet been observed (which is the case for many cities given the recency of the SDGs) the factors could help to demonstrate the positive effects that just engaging with the SDGs can bring. The official indicators and measurements for each SDG are quite specific and progress against these metrics can take time to be realised (UN, 2019 ). Yet the actual process of localising and engaging with the SDGs can have unique benefits on its own, particularly in relation to stakeholder cooperation and community participation (SDSN, 2016 ). The factors could be useful in this situation to explore these possible benefits and give legitimacy to the potentially transformative effects of simply engaging with the SDG agenda at a city level. In addition to being used directly on SDG implementation, the factors could also be used as a conceptual framework to explore the differing way this implementation fosters transformation. The general characteristics of most urban SDG implementation are similar – a city planning and progressing to achieve the SDG goals - but there are a variety of ways that city actors can engage with the SDG agenda. For example, some city councils may use the SDGs as a tool to benchmark policy performance, whereas others may use them as a tool to foster inter-stakeholder cooperation (SDSN, 2016 ). This means that the dynamics of transformation - what catalyses it, what factors are involved in it, how these factors combine – is likely to be different as well. The factors could be used as an initial tool to explore these different transformation dynamics and to better understand the differences and similarities in the transformative potential/capacity of these different approaches. The number of avenues for future research that stem from this review are a function of its positioning, acting as a bridge between the UT literature and the SDGs. The aim of this study was to identify the important factors for UT to occur so that they can be used to support and further the urban implementation of the SDG agenda. This was achieved, an initial set of factors was produced, and this allows for them to be potentially directly applied to the planning or initial SDG implementation process. However, it is acknowledged that these factors are only the first step in bridging these two topics and more work is needed to refine them, as evidenced by the suggested areas of improvement and iteration. These options are important next steps and would contribute to both bodies of knowledge but the value of this study is the foundation it provides for future research which truly integrates UT and the SDGs. The results of this study translate insights from the UT literature into a format that is more compatible with the SDGs; future research can use this format to further explore the unique transformation that is occurring - and is possible - as a result of the SDG agenda in cities.
