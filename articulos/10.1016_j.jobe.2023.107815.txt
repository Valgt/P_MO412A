                  The 2030 Agenda is an ambitious step towards sustainable development for the construction industry, which holds great potential for contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, challenges remain regarding the implementation of the goals. This study aims to investigate the level of integration of the SDGs at an early stage of a new school and kindergarten project in Denmark, which seeks to implement 14 of the SDGs and 50 targets actively throughout the project, along with exploring the decision-making process. The case study consists of two parts: interviews with the actors involved in developing the project's vision plan, hereunder prioritising the SDG and targets, followed by an analysis of the building brief, investigating the utilisation of the SDGs and targets. The interview results were designed and analysed through the lens of the values-rules-knowledge model. The results showed that the perceived level of integration of the SDGs differed among the involved actors, and that the targets that were most successfully implemented at this stage were SDGs 4, 9, 12 and 13. The main conclusion were that the SDGs were not a main driver in the decision-making process, due to the lack of measurability and benchmarking in building projects. The results contribute to the current effort toward implementing the SDGs in construction on a project-specific level, and the novelty lies in the analysis of the decision-making process through the values-rules-knowledge-model, the calculation of the SDG implementation percentage, and providing a best-practice example for SDG implementation in a construction project. The authors recommend further research focusing on case studies involving practical examples of SDG implementation in construction projects to support the operationalisation of the SDGs.

It creates a basis for working with sustainability and understanding the interaction between man, society, and nature. The area, fjord and sustainability are meaningful objects for pedagogical work in daycare, school, and leisure activities.      Image 12   12.2 Sustainable use of natural resources • Create a building that is genuinely sustainable throughout its life cycle. Sustainability must be considered holistically to embrace more than resources, material selection and execution methods. Outdoor unheated learning environments create a sustainable construction site through circular economy strategies, e.g., waste sorting, recycling, reused materials and fossil-minimised construction sites.  • Also, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cost Calculations (LCC) are used.     12.3 Reduce food waste • Establishing utility gardens and an outdoor kitchen to process and prepare food from the fjord, gardens, and nature can help support learning under the theme ‘From farm and fjord to table.'     12.4 Sound pollution management • Reducing necessary noise measures from external noise, such as traffic noise.

The 2030 Agenda is an ambitious step towards sustainable development for the construction industry, which holds great potential for contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, challenges remain regarding the implementation of the goals. This study aims to investigate the level of integration of the SDGs at an early stage of a new school and kindergarten project in Denmark, which seeks to implement 14 of the SDGs and 50 targets actively throughout the project, along with exploring the decision-making process. The case study consists of two parts: interviews with the actors involved in developing the project's vision plan, hereunder prioritising the SDG and targets, followed by an analysis of the building brief, investigating the utilisation of the SDGs and targets. The interview results were designed and analysed through the lens of the values-rules-knowledge model. The results showed that the perceived level of integration of the SDGs differed among the involved actors, and that the targets that were most successfully implemented at this stage were SDGs 4, 9, 12 and 13. The main conclusion were that the SDGs were not a main driver in the decision-making process, due to the lack of measurability and benchmarking in building projects. The results contribute to the current effort toward implementing the SDGs in construction on a project-specific level, and the novelty lies in the analysis of the decision-making process through the values-rules-knowledge-model, the calculation of the SDG implementation percentage, and providing a best-practice example for SDG implementation in a construction project. The authors recommend further research focusing on case studies involving practical examples of SDG implementation in construction projects to support the operationalisation of the SDGs.

The Agenda includes 17 goals for sustainable development (SDGs), supported by 169 targets and 231 global indicators, divided equally between environmental, social and economic sustainability dimensions (United Nations, 2015). The SDGs are concise and easy to communicate, providing a global and stable definition of sustainable development, which can be valuable for establishing a common ground for sustainable development within the construction industry [2 ]. The SDGs incorporate all dimensions of sustainable development in a balanced and interlinked manner, offering a better understanding of the relationship between social, economic, and environmental dimensions of sustainability [3 ]. With the construction industry being responsible for around 40% of energy use and one-third of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, the environmental aspects are urgent. However, a holistic perspective is necessary to ensure healthy, high-quality buildings without compromising the environmental and economic aspects. The 2030 Agenda offers a holistic framework on an overall level. However, the SDGs and targets must be translated to local and project-specific levels to become operational [1 ,4 ,5 ]. In Denmark, an action plan towards 2030 was presented by the Danish government in 2017 [6 ], and local SDG indicators have been developed to adapt the SDGs to a Danish context and establish a national baseline for the implementation of the SDGs [7 ]. To ensure successful adaption and implementation of the SDGs in construction projects, all involved actors in the value chain hold a responsibility for implementing the goals and pushing the sustainability agenda towards 2030. However, the professional building owners are responsible for setting ambitious goals for sustainability at the project's start and including specific requirements in the tender documents. A previous study among Danish building owners has shown that the main barriers to implementing the SDGs in construction, both strategically and on a project level, are lack of knowledge, limited time and resources, and lack of tools and methods supporting the process [8 ]. One way to support professional building owners and advisors in implementing the SDGs in construction projects is to provide practical knowledge, including examples and case studies representing best practices. Therefore, case studies providing insights into the decision-making process related to the implementation of the SDGs, along with specific goals and examples of SDG contribution can be valuable to researchers and practitioners within the filed. The objective of this study is to investigate the operationalisation of the SDGs and targets in the early stage of a new building project in Denmark through a case study: a new school and a daycare centre for kids aged 0–15 years. Actors involved in the development of a vision plan for the project were interviewed to interrogate the decision process related to the prioritisation and implementation of SDGs and targets. Subsequently, based on the vision plan, the building brief was analysed to investigate the level of implementation of SDGs and targets and how these were operationalised into specific functionalities and requirements for the new building. The results provide valuable insights into the practical application of the SDGs in a construction project and can benefit both practitioners within the building industry and researchers in the field of sustainable building design. Furthermore, it contributes to the current effort towards implementing the SDGs in construction on a project-specific level, contributing to achieving the 2030 Agenda. The article is structured as follows. First, the background for the study is presented in the introduction section, including a literature review to provide a state-of-the-art overview of the SDGs in the built environment. Furthermore, an introduction to the case project is provided, along with a presentation of the values-rules-knowledge (VRK) model, which is utilised as an analytical framework for investigating the decision process of SDG implementation in the vision plan. Then, the methods are presented, hereunder the research question and the methods for interviews and analysis of the building brief. The results section is divided into two parts: the results of the interviews and the results of the building brief analysis. The findings are then discussed, and the conclusions are summed up. 1.1 Literature review – SDGs in construction In recent years, sustainable building design has gained increasing attention in the academic literature. However, the literature investigating how the construction industry can contribute to achieving the 2030 Agenda is still limited. Goubran and Cucuzzella [2 ] presented a state-of-the-art review of how the SDGs have been utilised in sustainable building design and proposed two analytical mapping tools for tracking SDG integration in building projects. A research agenda for addressing the SDGs in construction was presented by Thuesen and Opoku [9 ], highlighting four research areas: 1) an understanding of the relationship between the goals, 2) developing measures for evaluating progress, 3) addressing the target with specific projects and 4) facilitating of knowledge transfer. Opoku [3 ] investigated the role of the built environment in achieving the SDGs, highlighting that the built environment, in particular, can contribute to society's socioeconomic development and well-being. Also, Goubran [10 ] identified SDG targets that depend directly or indirectly on construction activities, concluding that 17% of the SDG targets are directly dependent on the construction industry's activities, and 27% are indirectly dependent. Various frameworks to support the process of achieving the SDGs have been developed, e.g. the SDG Compass [11 ], providing a guide for business action on the SDGs, SDG Capture [12 ], which is a dialogue tool for spotting possibilities for innovation and sustainability, the SDG impact assessment tool (Chalmers University of Technology and University of Gotheborg, 2020), which is an online tool for assessing how an activity, organisation or innovation affects the SDGs, and, lastly, the SDG impact tool [13 ], which supports the user in evaluating business and society impacts related to the SDGs. Furthermore, Grainger-Brown et al. [14 ] have reviewed existing tools and frameworks for strategic implementation of the SDGs in organisations. The existing tools and frameworks are mainly conceptual and not adapted to the construction industry and building projects' specific needs [2 ,4 ]. While the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs provide a global framework for sustainable development, assessment frameworks for sustainable construction already exist and have been adapted to local contexts. These sustainability assessment frameworks can potentially support the operationalisation of the SDGs in construction. The links between several of the existing assessment frameworks and the SDGs have been explored in the literature. Alawneh et al. [15 ] investigated the link between several LEED criteria and the SDG, along with the broader contribution of six rating systems (LEED, BREEAM, CASBEE, Green Star, Green Mark and GBI) to the SDGs [16 ]. Miyazaki et al. [17 ] have looked at the link between CASBEE and the SDGs, and the Danish Green Building Council(2018) have mapped how the DGNB-DK criteria contribute to the SDGs and documented SDG contributions can carry extra credits in the latest DGNB-DK assessment manual. Several case studies that focus explicitly on implementing SDG in construction have been presented in the academic literature. Allen et al. [18 ] adopted an integrated assessment approach to support the prioritisation of SDG targets through a case study for 22 countries in the Arab region, assessing and prioritising SDG targets based on their “level of urgency”, “systematic impact” and “policy gap”. Goubran and Cucuzzella [2 ] investigated the implementation of the SDGs in an energy-positive building in Quebec by testing two proposed analytical mapping tools. The mapping tools were used during the integrated design process to track the integration of SDGs in the building project and to analyse the building design approaches and visions about the topics of the goals. Palliyaguru et al. [19 ] argue that there is a clear and critical need to empower rural communities in Sri Lanka to achieve the SDGs. They present the need for an integrated framework for sustainable building design and construction in the rural context, specifically focusing on the Ampara region of Sri Lanka, to address prevailing physical, social, and cultural issues. Manjia et al. [20 ] proposed a methodology for implementing sustainable construction indicators for social infrastructure. They identified objectives related to sustainable construction, applied to the case of a construction project in Cameroon. In addition to these studies, global cases of SDG implementation can be found in the two books “An Architecture Guide to the UN 17 Sustainable Development Goals” volumes 1 and 2 [21 ,22 ]. Only one of the cases found in the literature investigated how the SDGs were implemented in a building project, along with the related building design approaches and level of implementation. This gap in the literature calls for research to provide cases of SDG implementation in construction projects to support professional building owners, advisors and researchers with knowledge of how the built environment can contribute to achieving the relevant SDGs and targets.  1.2 Case presentation: A new building for kids and youth in the Northern part of Denmark The case investigated is a new building in the northern part of Denmark, which will include a new school and a daycare centre for kids aged 0–15 years (the building is called the Kids and Youth Universe, hereafter referred to as the KYU building). Furthermore, the building will house leisure and sports activities for kids and youth. The building owner is the municipality of Aalborg, Denmark, and the new building is part of a large development project for a whole new area of the city of Aalborg. Therefore, the project has gained significant political focus and interest, and so has the focus on adopting sustainable solutions for the project, both regarding the physical building and the pedagogical visions for the building. This article focuses on the programming phase, where an initial vision plan was made as a foundation for the building brief. The new building will aim towards a DGNB gold certification, along with achieving the specific sustainability goals of the vision plan and the building brief. The case has been selected for investigation because of the explicit focus on implementing SDGs and sustainable solutions. A vision plan was developed for the KYU building, describing the initial ideas and needs of the building owner organisation, including both the visions for the physical building, along with a pedagogical vision. The vision plan took its point of departure in the overall vision for the area and served as a foundation for the building brief. Physical and pedagogical visions were described as interlinked and intended to support each other, also from a sustainability perspective. The vision plan was developed by actors from different departments of the municipality, to ensure anchoring broadly in the organisation, along with external advisors counting both architects and engineers, and end-users. Apart from providing a foundation for the building brief, the vision plan also served to document the visions and ideas to a broader public audience.  1.3 Analytical framework Research has shown that the SDGs were not adapted to fit the construction industry context. One of the main characteristics of the construction industry is uncertainty, risk, and many changes [25 ,26 ]. In order to adapt the SDG to a construction industry context, the decisions that the practitioners need to make are subject to the industry's dynamic nature. For a better understanding of how decisions play into SDG's and the industry's context, we have applied Gorddard et al. [27 ] ‘s decision-making perspective called Values-Rule-Knowledge (VRK). The decision-making model, Fig. 1  , is a framework for analysing and diagnosing the institutional, value-based, and informal factors that constrain or enable decisions [27 ]. The VRK model has been applied as an analytical framework and procedure to help identify and interrogate the context of decisions and behaviours. The model provides a structured approach to investigate and understand the complex interaction between the system of values, rules and knowledge that enable and constrain the decision context. Specifically, VRK has been used to frame the empirical inquiry and for analysing the interactions between the individual perspectives. The approach is elaborated in the methods section. The dimensions of the VRK model are shown in Table 1   and have been used as a foundation for designing the interview guide, presented in the methods section.   2 Methods This section presents the overall research methodology. Then, the methods for conducting the interviews are presented, including the theoretical framework applied for analysing the interviews, followed by the method for analysing the building brief. A pragmatic philosophical perspective was adopted in the study. By conducting a single-case study method with multiple units of analysis [29 ], this study aims to investigate the implementation of the SDGs in the programming phase of a new building for kids and youth in Denmark, answering the following research question: Which role did the SDGs and targets play in the development of the vision plan for the project, and how are the SDG targets utilised in the building brief?  The research process is shown in Fig. 2   and comprised three main activities: 1) A desktop review of the relevant documentation from the building owner, including the vision plan for the whole area and the building itself, emphasising the sustainability goals. Also, the researchers took part in initial building meetings. 2) Qualitative interviews were held with the actors involved in the development of the vision plan to investigate the SDG implementation and prioritisation process, and 3) analysis of the building brief for the new building, investigating the utilisation of the SDGs and targets at this stage. The first part of the research question is approached through qualitative, semi-structured interviews with the actors involved in developing the vision plan. Following Kvale's [30 ] process for planning and conducting semi-structured interviews, an interview guide was designed as the first part of the process. The interview questions were structured and designed using the VRK framework [27 ] to ensure that the relevant dimensions of the decision context were included following the process of [28 ]. The interview questions are shown in Table 2  , including the predominant aspects in relation to the VRK model (values, rules and knowledge). The group developing the vision plan involved actors from different departments of the municipality, both the internal technical building advisors and urban developers, economists, representatives from the school and daycare departments, along with user representatives from both school, daycare, and local politicians. After initial conversations with the project managers from the different departments within the municipality, the researchers carefully selected seven actors who had been most involved in the process and, therefore, could provide the most detailed insights into the process. The roles of the interviewees were: an internal construction advisor, the manager of the internal construction department, a development consultant in the educational department of the municipality, the local town counsellor of education, the director of education for the municipality, the vice school manager, the administrator of the overall development of the area. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, all interviews were conducted online using MS Teams during the spring of 2020. Subsequently, the interviews were transcribed and condensed following the process of Kvale [30 ] and analysed using an abductive approach. The results of the interviews were categorised according to the relevant VRK dimensions. The second part of the research question was approached by analysing the building brief. The analysis was conducted to identify which SDGs and targets the building brief implicitly contributed to, along with the implementation level of each SDG in the KYU building. First, the requirements described in the building brief contributing to the SDGs and their targets were identified. Then, to evaluate the level of implementation of the SDGs, the Implementation Percentage of the targets (IP) was calculated by defining the total number of targets used for each SDG in the building brief in relation to the total number of SDG targets defined by the EU, accordingly, evaluating the SDGs implementation impact. The calculation process was developed by the authors and is elaborated in the results section.  3 Results First, the results of the interviews with the actors involved in creating the vision plan are presented, followed by the results of the building brief analysis, investigating the utilisation and potential contributions to the SDGs within the project at this stage. 3.1 Interview results In this section, the interview results are presented and structured according to the VRK analysis results. Overall, the interviews revealed that in practice, the SDG framework was perceived as abstract and challenging to adapt on a project-specific level. 3.1.1 SDG knowledge and values Overall, the interviewees had some general knowledge regarding the SDGs prior to their participation in the development of the vision plan. Most interviewees knew the SDG headlines but not the targets and indicators. The SDGs were seen as the overall framework for the project in terms of sustainable development and had a high political focus. However, the SDGs were perceived as abstract and not specific enough to be operational in a construction context. Furthermore, it was expressed that the targets were not directly applicable in a Danish context, as most indicators would automatically be met by the project being following Danish laws and the Danish building regulation. One interviewee expressed that:"Because we already had the DGNB framework, the SDGs did not result in a more sustainable building . But if we did not already have DGNB, the SDGs would definitely contribute to a more sustainable approach in the project ."   The SDGs did, therefore, not raise the bar significantly regarding the sustainable initiatives made in the project. However, the SDGs did provide an accessible, and easy to understand, framework for discussing the overall prioritizations in the project and ensured a holistic approach to the sustainability discussion, both from a pedagogical and a technical perspective. In that way, the SDGs provided a common language for discussions regarding the sustainability aspects on a national and global level, which made it easier to collaborate across the different administrations within the municipality during the process of developing the vision plan. Furthermore, it was expressed that the SDGs were also a valuable tool as a foundation for the dialogue with occupants and other stakeholders. The SDGs were perceived as a broad framework that could fit many aspects of the project, but as no documentation is formally required it was “easy” to say that the goals would be met, in opposition to the DGNB certification where documentation is required. The interviewees expressed that it was challenging to make the SDG operational – measurability and benchmarking are needed. Specific tools for measuring and benchmarking are called for in a Danish context by the involved actors, especially regarding the construction site and waste management. It was underpinned that the 2030 Agenda is not an operational tool, and therefore it could not be used as such in the process of developing the vision plan. In this project, the SDGs contributed to support the overall principles of sustainability, and it contributed positively to the political agenda, as the vision plan was a political document forming the base for the building brief.  3.1.2 Measurability and sustainability assessment (rules) It is a goal that the project will aim to be DGNB gold certified. The interviewees expressed that DGNB-DK framework provided a measurable framework for setting sustainability goals in the project, however primarily from the technical perspective and not explicitly the pedagogical perspective. The SDG framework supported the prioritisation of DGNB criteria, and the SDGs prioritised for the whole area provided an initial frame for this prioritisation. From previous experience, the municipality as building owner prioritised to have a high level of involvement in the DGNB certification process, and thereby in prioritising the criteria, and not leave this responsibility to the contractor. In that way, the municipality would have a more hands-on role in the process of prioritising criteria, and not only the final assessment result. Additionally, the importance of mapping the DGNB criteria to the SDGs were highlighted as a foundation for the process.  3.1.3 Conflicts and barriers in the decision process (values) The interviewees were asked to elaborate on the process of prioritising the SDGs. The project group went through the list of SDGs and checked off which they already could automatically meet through the project (e.g., quality education). Also, they went through the DGNB criteria to see which criteria were linked to contribute to specific targets, based on a publication on the links between DGNB-DK and the SDGs by GBC-DK [24 ]. As a comment to this process, one interviewee expressed that some of the SDGs the project seeks to contribute to were a bit ‘far-fetched’. The priorities of the SDGs were different from the different administrations within the municipality. E.g., the school administration primarily prioritised the goals related to SDG 4 (quality education), and the building administration prioritised the goals directly related to the building throughout the building's life cycle. However, there were no markable conflicts between the prioritisations, and they easily came to an agreement, it was expressed. Naturally, the different administrations brought different perspectives into the discussion, and that contributed to mutual inspiration. The biggest challenge was to convince the decision makers at the political level that the project would not be too expensive due to the focus on sustainability. It was a goal for the municipality that the sustainability goals should be an integrated part of the project and not make the project more expensive. In the perspective of the building administration, the sustainability aspects were common sense, but the politicians needed to be convinced. Apart from the economical barrier, it was also perceived as a barrier that the SDG headlines were very broad and not specific enough, even on an indicator level.  3.1.4 SDG prioritisation (values) The KYU project is expected to contribute to 14 of the 17 SDGs, directly and indirectly. It is up to the main contractor how these specifically will be achieved, and the level of achievement will be a competition parameter in the tendering process. The interviewees expressed that it is important to view the SDGs as a whole, as they are interconnected and interdependent. Based on the overall vision for the area, three main themes were in focus from an environmental perspective: climate, resources, and biodiversity. It was also perceived as important that the some of the sustainability aspects will be physically visual in the final building, and will be integrated as a part of the pedagogical practice of the school, such as including energy and indoor environmental data in the teaching, have visible reused materials, etc. The KYU building itself should foster sustainability awareness for the users of the building and invite and inspire to a more sustainable behaviour among both pupils and teachers.   3.2 The building brief's contributions to the SDGs This section presents the results of the analysis of the building brief's specific contributions to the SDGs and targets. The analysis was done by reading through the requirements described in the building brief, and identifying which SDGs and targets they contribute to – if applicable. The requirements and the related SDGs and targets are shown in Table 3  . The links to the SDGs and targets were not explicit in the building brief and are thereby based on the interpretations and mapping of the researchers. To investigate the level of implementation of the SDGs in the project at this stage, the Implementation Percentage (IP) was calculated by defining the total number of targets used for each SDG in the building brief in relation to the total number of SDG targets defined by the United Nations (UN), accordingly, evaluating the SDGs implementation impact. Three categories of data were then defined. An IP < 20%, indicates a low SDG implementation impact, an IP between 20 and 40% indicates an average implementation impact and an IP > 40% indicates a high implementation impact, as shown in Table 4  . For example, SDG 1 for no poverty consists of 7 targets in total, defined by the UN. While in the KYU case, only one target is used. Thus, the implementation percentage for SDG1 for KYU building is 14%, indicating that it has low SDG implementation impact. An overview of the implementation percentage for each SDG used in the KYU project is presented in Fig. 3  . It is observed that SDG1 (No poverty), SDG 2 (Zero hunger), SDG 5 (Gender equality), SDG 10 (Reduced inequalities), SDG 16 (Peace, justice and strong institutions) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for action) have an IP < 20%, meaning that they have a low implementation impact and are not in focus. The low SDG implementation can refer to positive social and political aspects, making it unnecessary to explicitly implement the goals in the project. For example, the lack of implementation of SDG 5 (Gender equality) and SDG 16 (Peace, justice, and strong institutions) reflects the national political strategies in democracy, providing gender equality and maintaining justice and peace, which are implicitly applicable to all building projects in Denmark. In addition, it is unclear from the building brief data whether the building contributes to SDG 10 (Reducing inequalities), therefore it is not to mentioned in the building brief analysis. SDGs with an IP between 20 and 40% are SDG 3 (Good health and well-being), SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (Affordable and clean energy), SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and communities), SDG 14 (Life below water) and SDG 15 (Life on land), indicating an average focus in the project. For example, an average implementation of SDG 2 (Stop hunger) may reflect the Danish society's high welfare and life quality, which does not require significant improvements in adding new features to the building. Goals 14 (Life in the sea) and 15 (Life on land) are also successfully implemented due to the project's location close to the fjord and park. SDGs with an IP > 40% are SDG 4 (Quality education), SDG 8 (Decent jobs and economic growth), SDG 9 (Industry, innovation and infrastructure), SDG 12 (Responsible consumption and production) and SDG 13 (Climate action), indicating a high focus and implementation impact of these SDGs. As an educational institute, the project naturally contributes to and facilitate SDG 4, 8, 9, 12 and 13. For example, it is revealed in the implementation of SDG 4 (Quality education) that 5 out of 10 targets are implemented. Therefore, the contribution to SDG 4 aligns very well with the project's pedagogical goals and values. Additionally, SDG 12 (Responsible consumption and production) is in high focus as it is one of the crucial goals to reduce the carbon footprint and waste materials by implementing circular strategies, reducing waste, reusing building materials and promoting recycling. Furthermore, SDG 13 (Climate action) is considered to have the most significant focus (60%) and the highest implementation impact on the project. Thus, it reflects the effectiveness and success of applying this SDG and aligns very well with the project vision and goals towards environmental and climate action strategies.   4 Discussion and conclusions This paper set out to investigate how the SDGs and targets were utilised in the programming stage of a new construction project in Denmark, by exploring the decision process related to the development of a vision plan for the project through interviews with the involved actors, along with analysing the building brief. The key findings from the interviews were that the SDGs served as an overall framework for sustainability and contributed to a holistic dialogue on sustainability among the actors. Also, the SDGs were perceived as a valuable framework for dialogue with the users and stakeholders. On the contrary, the actors expressed challenges in utilising the SDGs and targets on a project specific level, due to the lack of measurability and benchmarking in relation to building projects. This aligns with the results of Gade and Opoku [8 ], where the professional building owners and advisors expressed similar challenges. In the Danish context, the SDG targets has been adapted to the local context with relevant indicators. However, these are still not directly transferrable to specific building projects. In this case, DGNB-DK served the purpose of assessing sustainability, whereas the SDGs and targets were only applied as an overall framework, to ensure a balanced approach to sustainability, but did not, overall, raise the bar and make the project more sustainable. Also, they used the link between DGNB criteria and SDG targets provided in the latest DGNB manual to navigate which targets were included [24 ]. Also, the application of the SDGs in the project contributed to the political agenda regarding sustainability, even though it was a challenge to convince the politicians that the project would not be significantly more expensive for this reason. The process of prioritising which SDGs and targets should be included in the project did not have a primary focus, as the prioritisation was led by the SDG and targets included in the overall development of the area in which the new building is located, and due to the abstract nature of the targets in relation to construction. The internal bodies within the municipality represented differing values related to different SDGs, and the SDGs served as a framework for expressing these values and to make sure a balanced set of criteria were included in the building brief, representing social, environmental, and economic aspects. The main limitation of this study is the difficulty of generalisability of the findings from a single case. The results provide in depth analysis of the process related to a single construction project, which is considered a “best practice” example by the authors. The IP calculation method presented in the paper is applicable in other projects seeking to implement the SDGs, not only limited to the field of construction. The VRK model was applied to analyse the decision context and process and was used to design the interview guide to cover the aspects of values, rules, and knowledge and the interactions between these. This was done in order to interrogate the process of developing the vision plan and building brief in the context of emerging issues of global change, in this case the SDGs. The values of the interviewees can be divided into the themes of pedagogical, technical and economical values. The KYU project explicitly seeked to contribute to 14 of the 17 SDGs, directly and indirectly, and the building itself should foster sustainability awareness for the users, and thereby invite and inspire to a more sustainable behaviour among both pupils and staff. Through the analysis of the building brief the researchers found that the project potentially contributes to all of the 17 SDGs in various degrees. The main SDG contributions were SDG 4, 9, 12 and 13, reflecting the function of the building (educational), a focus on circularity, innovation, and reducing climate change. The rules playing a role in the project is primarily the Danish building regulation, the DGNB-DK criteria and the SDGs. The knowledge aspects identified were knowledge related to the SDGs and targets, of the DGNB-DK criteria, along with specific technical and pedagogical knowledge of the actors. This paper presents the findings related to the early stages of the KYU project – the development of a vision plan for the project along with the building brief and does therefore not necessarily reflect the impact on the final building. This study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by providing a practical example of how the SDGs can be applied in a construction project during the programming phase, along with insights on the related decision and prioritisation process. The results can benefit both actors within the construction industry, especially professional building owners and their advisors, along with researchers within the field of sustainable building design. The authors recommend future research focusing on case studies involving practical examples of SDG implementation in construction projects in order to support the operationalisation of the SDGs towards 2030, further development and testing of methods and tools to support and measure SDG implementation in construction projects, and, lastly, development and alignment of industry specific indicators.
