                  The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) comprise an important policy achievement towards identifying shared goals for addressing global challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss. Though policy coherence for sustainable development ultimately depends on coherence among the SDGs – as progress toward one goal should not hamper progress toward others – synergies and trade-offs are emerging among the metrics (indicators) used to measure progress towards the various targets of the SDGs. In this context, the choice of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita as an indicator for SDG 8 (“Decent Work and Economic Growth”) contradicts the evidence that limitless economic growth is not possible on a planet with finite resources. Here, we highlight how pursuing unconditional GDP growth risks failing to achieve the SDGs overall. We show how, in the European Union, GDP is unrelated to other measures of economic performance such as levels of employment, and relates inversely to indicators of environmental sustainability and broader measures of wellbeing. Pursuing SDG 8 through a continuous increase in GDP will therefore hinder the achievement of environmental goals and goals on reducing inequalities. We propose guidelines for selecting alternative indicators for SDG 8 with the aim of improving coherence among all of the SDGs, as well as between the SDGs and other policy initiatives for sustainability. This will inform a better monitoring of SDG 8 and the definition of post-2030 Agendas for sustainable development.

Globally, governments have committed to protect ecosystems, promote equality, and focus on sustainable development, while simultaneously recognizing the interconnectedness of these objectives for achieving human wellbeing. The concept of ‘policy coherence for sustainable development ’ in the UN 2030 Agenda emphasises the importance of coherent national political solutions for sustainable development. In fact, the ability to create coherence between and within the very broad policy areas of the SDGs is both a huge challenge and an absolute necessity (Mortensen and Petersen, 2017 ; Nordbeck and Steurer, 2016 ; Verschaeve et al., 2016 ). The SDGs are a series of 17 goals, each one including several targets and indicators. Targets specify the goals, and indicators represent the metrics by which to track whether targets are achieved (Ritchie and Mispy, 2018 ). For example, one of the targets of SDG 13 on “climate action” is to “strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate related hazards and natural disasters”. Progresses towards this target are assessed by means of several indicators, among which the “number of deaths, missing persons and directly affected persons attributed to disasters per 100,000 population” (please refer to UNSD, 2019  for the global goals, targets and indicators framework). The SDGs are indivisible and do not imply any prioritization of one goal over the others (UN, 2015a ). Instead, the overarching goal of ‘a prosperous, high quality of life that is equitably shared and sustainable ’ is achievable through simultaneous and balanced progress towards all of the SDGs (Costanza et al., 2016 ). This is only obtainable if no contradictions hold among the SDGs, and among the policies for implementing the Agenda. Research in this vein is showing how the SDGs and relative targets and indicators interact with each other, identifying trade-offs and synergies (Pradhan et al.,  2017; Scherer et al., 2018 ; Zhang et al., 2019 ), as well as systemic interactions (Nilsson et al., 2016 ; Le Blanc, 2015 ; Lu et al., 2015 ; Costanza et al., 2014a ). Among others, Costanza et al. (2014b)  discussed the trade-off that might exist between efforts towards goals on the protection and sustainable use of biodiversity and on climate action, and goals on consumption and production and economic growth. Nilsson et al. (2016)  provide an example where boosting consumption for growth can counteract waste reduction and climate mitigation. Spaiser et al. (2017)  observed that the current economic system based on growth and consumption makes some of the SDGs incompatible. Wackernagel et al. (2017)  highlights the link between high development patterns and increasing use of resources, while simultaneously neglecting resource security aspects for the current and future generations. Positive interactions between goals are also evident, in particular regarding goals on reducing inequalities, including gender inequalities, and goals on education, poverty eradication and health promotion (Niessen et al., 2018 ). The SDGs provide a platform for global dialogue, recommending assessment tools for progress in multiple areas of sustainable development and in multiple cultural contexts. Nonetheless, enhancing coherence between science and policy demands the definition of clear, unambiguous and measurable targets, so that policy success or failure can be evaluated (Donohue et al., 2016 ). While the goals define what is desirable in a particular area of sustainable development, synergy and consistency among SDGs ultimately depends on defining the right targets and choosing the right indicators, where there are substantive interactions among the SDGs (ICSU, 2017 ). This process of integration is both bottom-up and top-down, with numbers (that is, the indicators) reflecting faithfully what is identified by words and symbols (that is, the goals), and vice versa  (Fig. 1  ). As in a game of Chinese whispers (aka the ‘Telephone Game’), clear understanding is key along this goals-targets-indicators chain in order to end up with indicators that are consistent with the goals. Inconsistencies will rapidly emerge between goals and indicators if the latter do not reflect the wordings of the former, or if the former are unspecific or incorporate poorly defined terms. Targets, at the interface between indicators and goals, should define, or refer to, quantifiable policy objectives. Here, we explore how the narrative espoused by the definition and symbol of SDG 8 influences the choice of indicators at the EU scale and represents a challenge for achieving policy coherence for sustainable development. We echo the view of Redclift (2005)  and Spaiser et al. (2017)  that ‘sustainable economic growth’ is an oxymoron on a planet with finite resources (Meadows et al., 1972 ; Turner, 2014 ; Raworth, 2017 ). This perpetuates the idea of absolute decoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation as a way to ditch the argument that achieving sustainability might require accepting lower growth and lower consumption levels, and thus discourage the exploration of political solutions in this sense (Ward et al., 2016 ; Parrique et al., 2019 ). It also supports the inclusion of indicators that are unable to account for the negative externalities of economic growth, disregard environmental boundaries, and leave societal priorities (e.g. inequitable distribution of wealth) unresolved. We also discuss how the SDG 8 symbol is not coherent with the idea of sustainable development, and we propose a series of adjustments for measuring progress towards SDG 8, aiming at strengthening policy coherence between it and the overall Agenda for Sustainable Development.  2 Monitoring ‘sustainable economic growth’ 2.1 Links among SDG 8 targets and indicators Assessment of progress towards the achievement of the SDGs for the EU Member States and the overall Union is done by monitoring a set of 100 indicators selected as relevant in the EU and in accordance with the quality criteria of the European Statistics Code of Practice (Eurostat, 2017 ). However, only 16 out of the 100 indicators have existing EU policy targets (Eurostat, 2019 ) (Table S1 ). This reflects a lack of quantified policy targets – an issue that is not, of course, limited to the EU but is global in scale (Donohue et al., 2016 ), with the notable exception of recent climate change agreements (UN, 2015b ). Among the EU SDGs indicators with no policy target, GDP per capita is a measure of progress towards sustaining per capita economic growth (Fig. 1 ). As no quantifiable target exists for this indicator at the EU level, a continuous increasing trend – the faster, the better – indicates progress towards SDG 8 (Eurostat, 2018 ). In order for development ‘to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own ’ (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987 ), economic growth can only go to the point where the use of resources does not exceed the capacity of nature to regenerate them, or the capacity of humans to produce renewable substitutes (Daly, 1990 ). By exceeding these physical and technical limits, economic growth risks generating more harms than benefits. Some of the countries that championed the economic growth race in the last decade, such as India (with a six-fold increase of GDP per capita since 1990, and an average annual GDP growth rate over 7% in the last 20 years), left largely unresolved their problems of chronic poverty and pollution, among others (Bush et al., 2011 ; de Onis and Blössner, 2003 ; Reserve Bank of India, 2013 ), while the biggest economy in the world, the United States, has a poverty rate in excess of 12% (Fontenot et al., 2018 ). The concentration of economic growth in a restricted group of society has detrimental effects on general well-being. In fact, economic inequality promotes increasing defensive expenditures, and more unequal societies have higher rates of violence, worse health conditions, higher imprisonment and addiction rates, and worse social relationships (Wilkinson and Pickett, 2009 , 2018 ). As consumption-based macroeconomic indicators such as GDP do not account for the harms caused by economic growth as such, many are calling for going beyond these as a measure of progress and well-being (Coscieme et al., 2019 ; Fioramonti et al., 2019 ; Costanza et al., 2014b , c ; Kubiszewski et al., 2013 ; Jackson, 2009 ). Within the SDGs indicators, the use of GDP for measuring sustainable economic growth brings significant divergence between efforts toward achieving SDG 8 and those toward the other goals, thus hampering policy coherence considerably (Spaiser et al., 2017 ). Through the wordings of its targets, SDG 8 is the third most interconnected of the SDGs (having strong links with SDGs 1, 2, 4, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16) (Le Blanc, 2015 ). For example, SDG 8 links to SDG 12 on sustainable consumption and production through its target on ‘decouple economic growth from environmental degradation’, and links to SDG 10 on reduced inequalities through its target on ‘protect labour rights for all workers, including migrant workers’ (Le Blanc, 2015 ). For Sweden, targets from SDG 8 are amongst the most positively influencing targets on the others in an analysis considering interactions on a sample of 34 total targets, with 2 selected targets for each SDG (Weitz et al., 2018 ). This high degree of interconnectedness is, however, lost in the EU SDGs indicator set, where only 2 indicators from SDG 8 contribute to monitoring progress towards other goals (Eurostat, 2017 ), placing SDG 8 among the least influencing goals at the indicator level. However, network analysis at the goal, or target, level refer to the broader global context (Le Blanc, 2015 ), pointing out either an inconsistency between the interconnectedness of the goal and the indicators, and/or the fact that the centrality of SDG 8 at the global scale does not hold when considering the EU context. Among the six indicators measuring progress toward SDG 8 for the EU, three refer to employment (that is, total employment rate, young people neither in employment nor in education and training, and long-term unemployment rate), two refer to decent work (involuntary temporary employment and people killed in accidents at work), and GDP per capita refers to economic growth (Eurostat, 2017 ). A certain degree of correlation exists among measures of employment (specifically, between the number of young people unemployed and the long-term unemployment rate, both of which correlate negatively with the employment rate; Eurostat, 2017 ), while decent work and economic growth do not show any significant association. Due to the fact that it is not related with most of the other SDG 8 indicators and not referring to any quantifiable policy target, GDP per capita growth risks being an end in itself that is hardly coherent to the rationale of the goal. In fact, GDP does not account for inclusiveness nor does it provide any information on the sustainability of economic growth (Fioramonti, 2013 , 2017 ). Indicators that provide a broader accounting on the effects of economic growth, at the local as well as the global scale, are needed to replace GDP in the SDG 8 indicator set to enhance its coherence with the overall SDGs Agenda.  2.2 Sustainable economic development in the European Union The UN defines a quantifiable target for SDG 8 as a minimum 7% annual growth in GDP for the least developed countries, posing the now long-standing question as to the parameters against which we are measuring development. There is, however, no indication on which kind of growth developed countries should aim for, as some forms of GDP growth may negatively affect environmental quality, human health and social relationships, and could further stress inequalities. The categorization of countries into developed and developing is relevant to international policymaking, regarding, for example, the allocation of responsibility for the negative impacts of development processes on the global environment and the consequent expectation for stronger commitments to global environmental agreements (UN, 2015b ; IISD, 2018 ). We may also argue that, as no country is currently meeting the basic needs of its population at a globally sustainable level of resource use, we all live in developing countries in terms of sustainable development (Raworth, 2017 ; Wackernagel et al., 2017 ). Though the SDGs are not legally binding, governments can take ownership and establish national frameworks for their achievement. The focus on continuous economic growth and the use of GDP as its measure in the EU ignores the well-known criticisms of GDP as a misleading indicator of progress, accounting negative aspects of life as positive, disregarding inequalities and fostering over-consumption (Fioramonti, 2013 , 2017 ; Easterlin et al., 2010 ; Fanning & O’Neill, 2019 ). From 2000 to 2011, prior to the implementation of the SDGs and Agenda 2030, 27 of 28 EU countries substantially increased their GDP per capita. During the same period, 18 of the EU-28 decreased their adjusted net savings, mainly due to increasing cost of damage from carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel use (World Bank, 2017 ) (Table 1  ). While GDP correlates positively with resource and energy consumption (Pulselli et al., 2015 ; Ward et al., 2016 ), EU countries are already using an excessive amount of resources, as evidenced by their Ecological Footprint balances (GFN, 2017 ; Vanham et al., 2019 ) and various well-being indicators that aim to correct GDP, such as the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) and the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI). Between 2000 and 2011, ISEW per capita was lower than 50% of GDP per capita in ten of the EU-28 countries (i.e. Croatia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Ireland, Italy, Luxemburg, Poland, Romania, Norway). It was between 30% and 50% of GDP per capita in nine countries (i.e. Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Lithuania, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and the U.K.), and at least 10% in the remaining nine countries (i.e. Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Malta, Netherlands, Slovenia). The ISEW considers personal consumption, but accounts for distributional imbalances and allocates defensive expenditures as negative (as, for example, a fraction of the total health expenditures). Furthermore, the ISEW accounts for the costs of climate change long-run environmental damage and the depletion of mineral, energy and forest stocks. On absolute terms, ISEW is lower than GDP in all the European countries: higher in northern Europe, in particular in Germany and Scandinavia, but also France, while lower in southern Europe (Menegaki et al., 2017 ). These facts demonstrate how, before the SDGs came to be, increasing GDP did not always mean, in Europe, enhanced well-being. By continuing to use economic growth as a goal in EU policy, there is a significant risk of maintaining unsustainable practices in global markets, such as outsourcing and delocalization of environmental and social impacts, ultimately hampering global sustainability. For example, differences in GDP per capita across countries largely determine the geography of transnational investments on land (Fig. 2  a; Coscieme et al., 2016 ), often resulting in unsustainable agricultural practices, environmental impacts, worsening welfare of local communities, and the violation of human rights (Rulli et al., 2013 ; Carmody, 2016 ). A lamentable shortcoming of the SDGs is that they fail to address transnational issues such as these (Koff and Maganda, 2016 ). SDG 8 then effectively acts as a free-pass for high-income countries to keep growing at the expense of lower-income countries and for maintaining the status-quo of national economic policy and international power relations, instead of creating an opportunity to change current economic behaviour (Dell’Angelo et al., 2017 ; Schönherr et al., 2017 ). The displacement of production processes and the producer-based allocation of environmental responsibilities affect sustainability assessments (Bastianoni et al., 2019 ). Combining perspectives where both producers and consumers are responsible for environmental and social impacts is essential for including the effect of trading in monitoring progress towards sustainability (Caro et al., 2017 ). This is particularly relevant in the EU context, as the EU accounts for the second largest share of global exports and imports of goods, and is a net importer of CO2  emissions, to the extent that import-embodied emissions are more than three times the export-embodied ones (Fig. 2 b; Fezzigna et al., 2019 ). It thus remains to be seen how the SDGs are going to address these transnational and transboundary issues, as they clearly affect sustainability, both in the EU and globally.   3 Seeking coherence between narratives, policies and indicators 3.1 Symbols matter The SDG 8 symbol (Fig. 1 ) depicts an arrow pointing upward and forward, suggesting the possibility of limitless economic growth as no borders or limits are drawn. This narrative, which seems to originate from a business perspective of maximization of outputs, neglects fundamental scientific knowledge and global advances in governance. It also motivates unsustainable behaviours. For example, the SDG8 symbol is not consistent with the EC, 2015  circular economy package (EC, 2015 ), that aims for “a circular economy which respects planetary boundaries” (EEA, 2017 ; EC, 2019 ). This policy incoherence is affecting the whole goal-targets-indicators chain of SDG 8, down to the use of GDP for monitoring progress. GDP is, in fact, unable to account for the benefits provided by approaches such as sharing, repairing, reusing, refurbishing and recycling existing products and materials and maintaining utility over time, all of which are fundamental to the implementation of a circular economy (EEA, 2016 , 2017 ; Fioramonti et al., 2019 ). Within the SDGs, the goal of economic growth as growing GDP per capita is not consistent with the “environmental” goals (that is, Goals 13, 14 and 15; Hickel, 2019 ) or goals on reduced inequalities and sustainable production and consumption (Goals 10 and 12; Lafortune et al., 2018 ). The empirical evidence is, for example, that inequality is increasing both within and among countries as GDP increases (Piketty, 2014 ; Milanovic, 2011a ,b ). In order to achieve policy coherence, the symbol for SDG 8 should recall circularity (following the lead of the symbol for SDG 12). Examples of graphical representations of the Earth’s physical limits to economic growth include the empty/full world representation of the economy as a subsystem of ecosystems and natural capital (Daly, 1990 ; Daly and Farley, 2004 ) and the doughnut economics representation of environmental boundaries and social foundations of Kate Raworth (2017) .  3.2 A new SDG 8 narrative for policy coherence Here, we propose some adjustments along the goal-targets-indicators chain for SDG 8 around specific aspects of sustainability, aiming to better align the goal with the overall 2030 Agenda and other international policy initiatives, such as the circular economy (EC, 2015 ): Interconnectedness : global analysis at the goal and target levels indicate that SDG 8 is highly interconnected with many other goals (Le Blanc, 2015 ; Weitz et al., 2018 ). Respecting this interconnectedness at the indicator level means improving coherence both within the goal and among the SDGs. As GDP provides misleading information about the environmental and social costs of economic growth, and is not able to account for new business models that foster the implementation of a circular and more sustainable economy (Fioramonti et al., 2019 ), relying on GDP is clearly incoherent with the other SDGs. Consequently, indicators that link positively with other goals are preferable to GDP as indicators for SDG 8 in Europe. Assuring progress towards SDG 8 means progress towards sustainable development therefore requires replacement of GDP with other indicators, such as, for example, the GPI (Talberth et al., 2007 ) or the ISEW (Daly and Cobb, 1989 ), that align more coherently with the other goals by accounting as negative defensive expenditures and the deterioration of environmental and social capital (Kubiszewski et al., 2013 ; Wilkinson and Pickett, 2009 , 2018 ). Global dimension : sustainability is a global issue (Bastianoni et al., 2019 ), as it involves solving global scale challenges, from biodiversity loss to climate change. Indicators for sustainable economic growth should account for the effects of domestic growth in other countries (Caro et al., 2017 ; Rulli and D’Odorico, 2014 ; Coscieme et al., 2016 ) and the global commons (e.g. the atmosphere) (Costanza, 2017 , 2016 ; Farley et al., 2015 ). Growth quality : as SDG 8 is on ‘sustainable economic growth’, as opposed to simply ‘economic growth’, GDP, a measure of the latter, is not coherent with its narrative. At the UN level, SDG 8 aims to overcome under-consumption as one of the causes jeopardizing the social contract of democratic societies (UN, 2015a ). This might be misleading in the sense that may justify the quantitative argument of consuming more and more as prevailing over the qualitative argument of consuming better. In the EU, growth has already brought unrivalled prosperity and it now makes more sense to improve the economy instead of enlarging it, making sure in the interests of equality that everyone is included (Trebeck and Williams, 2019 ). Improvements in resource efficiency in consumption and production and efforts to decouple economic development from environmental degradation need to happen together with an overall reduction of resource use in absolute terms (Hickel, 2019 ). Indicators and data : ‘beyond-GDP’ indicators are able to measure economic growth while being more consistent with the concept of sustainable development. There should be a stronger political willingness to invest in advancing data collection for (and systematic calculation of) these indicators, as they reflect how sustainable different economic growth patterns are. The use of simplified calculation methods for these indicators is worthy of further exploration (Lawn, 2005 ; Bleys, 2007 ; Menegaki et al., 2017 ; Pulselli et al., 2012 ), noting that established standard indicators such as GDP are also not immune, as is the case with any indicator, from statistical errors undermining accuracy and from falsification and manipulation (The Economist, 2015 ; Chew, 2015 ; Zwijnenburg, 2015 ).   4 Conclusions The SDGs are a milestone in policy advancement for sustainability. They are the result of a continuous improvement process from the Millennium Development Goals. At the same time, their implementation is already highlighting knowledge gaps and methodological needs that will ideally feed into post-2030 Agendas for Sustainable Development. Sustainable development requires policy coherence, as it requires policy action from multiple areas. In the context of the SDGs, this demands a coherent narrative both within and across the goals, and an alignment of the goals with other policy initiatives for sustainability. SDG 8 on sustainable economic growth is only one of many SDGs. However, it should be re-framed to be more coherent with the others, in order to drive progress on economic growth that does not limit progress in other environmental and social aspects. By relying on GDP, SDG 8 on sustainable economic growth risks bringing about significant policy incoherence. Some elements of the SDG 8 narrative do not align with the concepts of circular economy and planetary boundaries. The idea of infinite growth on a finite planet betrays our pact of solidarity with future generations, and is incoherent with sustainable development. The risk of using GDP per capita as a primary indicator for SDG 8 exposes the risk that efforts towards achieving SDG 8 will hinder achievement of other goals. This is because an incoherent narrative eventually leads to the choice of misleading indicators. The use of GDP as a measure of sustainable economic growth in the EU SDG indicator set sends the wrong signals to policymakers, particularly in those countries where negative effects of growth exceed positive effects. National SDG frameworks cannot consider GDP as the sole indicator of sustainable economic growth, as it does not align with the other goals and does not consider the global dimension of sustainability nor the quality of different growth patterns. Monitoring progress towards SDG 8 needs to consider further macro-economic indicators such as, for example, GPI and ISEW that internalize social and environmental externalities, together with indicators that account for resource use efficiency and (decreasing) overall consumption. Sustainable development provides solutions that clarifies how the choice of ‘the environment versus the economy’ is indeed a false choice (Costanza et al., 2014d ). Indicators able to account for progress towards sustainability exist and are extremely useful for informing coherent political processes. Overall, policy coherence in the 2030 Agenda and future political agendas for sustainable development will benefit from (1) maintaining coherent interconnectedness of the goals through targets and indicators, (2) acknowledging the global dimension of sustainability (which implies the consideration of transboundary issues such as outsourcing and delocalization of impacts), (3) building a narrative of shared goals that work for all of the very different countries on Earth, and (4) increasing efforts in developing indicators (and the supporting data) that are consistent with sustainability principles and the advancements in sustainability science and governance.
