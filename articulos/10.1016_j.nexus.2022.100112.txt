                  The world is currently striving to achieve the globally adopted sustainable development goals (SDGs). Exploring the role of technology in achieving the SDGs is critical for the decision-makers and will allow them to overcome any possible trade-off. In this work, the role of wastewater management in achieving the SDGs has been indicated. The analysis shows that wastewater treatment could contribute to achieving 11 out of 17 SDGs. The major contribution came from its ability to increase water availability (SDG 2: zero hunger and SDG 6: clean water and sanitation), enhance human health worldwide (SDG 3: Good health and wellbeing), providing a new source of income for smallholder (SDG 1: no poverty and SDG 8: decent work and economic growth), converting waste to energy (SDG 7: affordable and clean energy, and SDG 9: industry, innovation and infrastructure) and reducing the environmental impact of wastewater (SDG 11: sustainable cities and communities, SDG 12: responsible consumption and production, SDG 13: climate action, and SDG 14: life below water). The challenges related to implementing and assessing these targets were discussed as well. A set of indicators (guideline) were proposed to improve the contribution of the wastewater treatment facility to the SDGs. This study emphasizes on the significant influence of wastewater treatment on the United Nations' SDGs and targets worldwide.

Exploring the role of technology in achieving the SDGs is critical for the decision-makers and will allow them to overcome any possible trade-off. In this work, the role of wastewater management in achieving the SDGs has been indicated. The analysis shows that wastewater treatment could contribute to achieving 11 out of 17 SDGs. The major contribution came from its ability to increase water availability (SDG 2: zero hunger and SDG 6: clean water and sanitation), enhance human health worldwide (SDG 3: Good health and wellbeing), providing a new source of income for smallholder (SDG 1: no poverty and SDG 8: decent work and economic growth), converting waste to energy (SDG 7: affordable and clean energy, and SDG 9: industry, innovation and infrastructure) and reducing the environmental impact of wastewater (SDG 11: sustainable cities and communities, SDG 12: responsible consumption and production, SDG 13: climate action, and SDG 14: life below water). The challenges related to implementing and assessing these targets were discussed as well. A set of indicators (guideline) were proposed to improve the contribution of the wastewater treatment facility to the SDGs. This study emphasizes on the significant influence of wastewater treatment on the United Nations' SDGs and targets worldwide.   Keywords Wastewater treatment methodologies  Sustainable development goals (SDGs)  Waste to energy  Indicators  Clean water and sanitation    1 Introduction Wastewaters have daily emerged from various activities like households, agricultural, and industrial, with huge hydraulic loads and diverse compositions [1 ,2 ]. Effluents of those different sectors contain organic carbon, nitrogenous organics, inorganics, suspended/dissolved solids, and heavy metals [3 ,4 ]. Aerosols from wastewater treatment processes could transfer infectious agents. For instance, the aerosolized droplets of contaminated wastewater were responsible for the spread of the viral infection of SARS-CoV in large numbers of people in China [5] . The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater was recorded and gave an alert to the potential transmission risk of this virus through wastewater, with a special focus on the workers in water/wastewater treatment plants [6] . In addition, wastewater can also transfer other diseases, for example, millions of people die every year as a result of dysentery, cholera, typhoid, and other diarrheal diseases caused by poor sanitation [7] . Hence, the uncontrolled disposal of untreated wastewaters into the water resources is associated with significant hazardous impacts on humans and the environment [8] . The challenges toward this wastewater are the complexity and heterogeneity of the pollutants resulting in the need for highly efficient technologies in order to meet the required standards for water quality [9] . The United Nations, under its Global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Fig. 1  ), is calling to have universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030. The latest United Nations statistics showed that the efforts toward achieving this goal are still slow in most countries. Subsequently, it is of significant importance to be aware of the potential risk of raw wastewater for the sake of public health and the economy owned to its high environmental impacts on receiving water bodies and its overall operational costs. Subsequently, water treatment is a prominent factor in the achievement of sustainable water provision [10–12] . Life cycle assessment (LCA) and environmental impact quantification (EIQ) and water footprint (WF) are important features to address sustainability applied for the relationship between production/consumption elements, pollution threats, and essential natural resources depletion [13] . Numerous studies have been assessed the environmental impacts of wastewater treatment plants using different impact assessment instruments like LCA, EIQ, and gray water footprint (GWF) to support water management stakeholders [10 ,14 ]. Management of wastewater can develop various avenues for the circular economy, and it also develops new business models due to the reuse/recovery of useful by-products [15 ,16 ]. The environment has been frequently evolving and changing over the years, and the development made by humans has led to creating an impact on society on the whole. Urbanisation and industrialization have significantly contributed to adversely impacting the society and environment [17–19] . As a consequence of that, several issues have been provoked to be managed on a broad level. Societies globally are facing different sorts of challenges in the contemporary environment, and so inclining towards sustainable development has become vital in many aspects [20–22] . It is critical to make sure that immense focus is put on sustainable development, along with identifying and rectifying activities that are negatively contributing to societies. Governments today have been highly concerned about the adversities and negativities being caused by businesses and individuals to the society and environment. Besides, the relevant institutes have been involved in positively contributing to the issues like wastewater management along with many other problems. In line with the fact that resources are scarce, societies need to ensure the optimum usage of such resources, and immense focus must be given on sustainable development as well. Another important role of wastewater treatment is contributing to the circular economy. The circular economy is a concept built to ensure that products, materials, and raw materials remain in the long within the supply chain (economy) for the longest period. The circular economy also ensures that waste should be treated as secondary raw material and reused within the supply chain (economy) [23 ,24 ]. The contribution of the wastewater treatment plants within the circular economy are coming from their ability to recover nutrients, reuse water, and recover energy [25] . Since the adoption of the SDGs in 2015, there were several studies attempt to analyse the contribution of the wastewater treatment facility to the SDGs [26–31] . However, most of these studies were focusing on contribution to one SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) [27]  or focused on conducting a multi-criteria decision analysis to evaluate rising wastewater technologies could increase the contribution [29] , or focused on the analysis of case study [30] . In addition, most of the previous studies have not emphasized on analysis of wastewater treatment facilities on other SDGs and didn't provide the decision-maker with a guideline on how the contribution could be enhanced. Energy nexus is one of the tools (concept) used to analysis this relation between these elements, water and energy, with special emphasis on the trade-off relation [32–34] . Hence two of the SDGs focuses on water and energy, namely “SDG 6: clean water and sanitation” and “SDG 7: affordable and clean energy”. The wastewater treatment facility has important role in increasing the water availability and in parallel the wastewater treatment facility has both positive and negative impact on the energy [35 ,36 ]. The analysis of nexus that exists between wastewater treatment facility and related SDGs is important for the different players within the industry. Conducing the energy nexus study has several benefits, such as achieving the sustainable development, lowering the impact of population growth, lowering the poverty, lowering the urbanization impact, understating the relation between different SDGs [37–41] . This study provides a comprehensive assessment between wastewater treatment facility and water-energy (SDG 6: clean water and sanitation” and “SDG 7: affordable and clean energy”). This paper has two main objectives i.e., analysis of the contribution of the role of wastewater treatment to the SDGs and provide guidelines to improve the positive of wastewater treatment in the SDGs. To achieve these two objectives, this study started by giving a brief background about the wastewater treatment methodologies and the selection criteria among the different methods. Then it focuses on discussing the wastewater treatment contribution to SDGs. In addition, to increase the contribution of wastewater treatment facilities to the SDGs, a set of indicators, guidelines, were proposed. The proposed indicators will ensure that wastewater treatment facility sustainability performance is increased and will maximize the contribution of wastewater treatment facilities to the SDGs.  2 Background of the wastewater treatment methodologies The traditional wastewater treatment process includes integrated steps for the removal of solids, organic matters, and nutrients from wastewater. Combinations of physical, chemical, and biological processes are typically involved in a sequential way to achieve treated wastewater with certain specifications. The wastewater treatment process includes some common sub-processes like adsorption, photodegradation, coagulation-flocculation, ionic exchange, precipitation, biological and membrane separation [42]  as following: 2.1 Adsorption process Adsorption is depends on contacting the wastewater with the reactive adsorbent (highly specific surface area, porous or/and contains targeted functional group) for a definite equilibrium time [43 ,44 ]. After water purification, the exhausted adsorbents could be reused several times (with/without regeneration) [45] . The process is simple, low-cost but it is not suitable for large volumetric flow rates or highly contaminated wastewater.  2.2 Ion exchange An ion exchanger is another common technique used in water treatment to remove heavy metals where the ions in the solid and liquid are exchanged reversely. The H+  is liberated from the acidic group of the resin to facilitate the completion of the metals with the free functional groups. The technique is fast, and it is economic if the membrane regeneration is easy and cheap. But the disadvantages of this technique are membrane fouling, the existence of free acid may reduce the overall efficiency of the system owned to low affinity for binding, also the process is not suitable for high metals concentration. Precipitation is a process that implements chemical agents to form insoluble precipitates of the pollutants and it is usually followed by filtration to remove the generated sludge. It is a principal technique used in water and wastewater treatment plants. The merits of this technique are the simplicity and the low cost, but its efficiency is quite low in case of high contaminate loads. Also, it consumes precipitation agents and produces large amounts of sludge in addition to slow contact time.  2.3 Coagulation/flocculation In the coagulation/flocculation operations, a coagulant, like metal salts and polymers, is added to the polluted wastewater under short fast mixing where this coagulant facilitates the particles of the pollutants to aggregate and stack on it. Those flocculants and polymers, under low mixing conditions, allow the large flocs to form larger aggregates that enhance their precipitation. This technique is economic and simple. Still, the obstacles are the low efficiency, production of sludge, and requirement for an additional post treatment stage, i.e.; sedimentation [43 ,46 ]. Natural materials like Tamarindus Indica, Moringa oleifera, and Musa genus were suggested as coagulants [44 ,45 ,47 ].  2.4 Membrane technologies Membrane technology includes the application of low pressure-driven membranes (distillation, microfiltration, and ultrafiltration), high pressure-driven membranes (reverse osmosis and nanofiltration), and osmotic pressure-driven membrane processes (electrodialysis and liquid membrane) (Fig. 2  ). The process depends mainly on the membrane characteristics (surface charge, pore size, pore distribution, degree of hydrophobicity/ hydrophilicity), and the implemented pressure [48] . The membranes structures could be polymers, ceramics, carbon, titanium, and titanium oxide-based materials [49] . The membranes are classified according to their pore size: microfiltration (0.1–10 µm), ultrafiltration (0.1–0.001 µm), and nanofiltration (0.5–2.0 nm) [49] .  2.5 Biological processes Biological treatment is widely used in wastewater treatment [50] . The process involves the development, enrichment, and activation of the various useful microorganisms (fungi, algae, and bacteria) in the wastewater itself or specific bacteria obtained from an external source that can degrade different biodegradable contaminants in wastewater (Fig. 3  ). Biological processes are eco-friendly, cheap, and consume low energy [51 ,52 ]. The treatment could be aerobic, and the main products are carbon dioxide, biomass, and water. For anaerobic conditions, methane and carbon dioxide are the main products. The mechanism includes some reactive functional groups like carboxyl, phosphate, amino, and hydroxyl on the microorganism that attract/react with the different pollutants in addition to catabolism reactions [53] . The main challenges of such processes are the long time and difficulty in control.   3 Recent technologies The traditional methods of wastewater management are not sufficient for the increasingly polluted wastewater streams from municipal and industrial activities. This is raised from the increase in wastewater quantities and pollution degree. Subsequently, there is increasing attention to develop innovative wastewater treatment technologies in order to ensure safe discharging of the municipal and industrial wastewater to the ecosystems. However, the recent technologies are mainly hybrid systems where two or more treatment methods are combined to fulfill the required quality of the discharged water. The hybrid systems can save operational space, time, cost, and energy consumption [56] . Some of the most important studies are discussed in the following sections: 3.1 Advanced oxidation process Advanced oxidation process (AOP) is a method that depends mainly on breaking down the organic contaminants using hydroxyl radical (•OH) in polluted wastewater into carbon dioxide, simpler products, and water. This method could be applied in a fluidized bed reactor (Fig. 4  ) in order to increase the overall treatment efficiency [57] . The AOPs could be integrated with the membrane technologies in two approaches; two stand-alone units where the AOP is performed as a pre-treatment stage in case of membrane fouling or as post-treatment. The second broach is to combine the two processes in the same reactor and this hybrid system is preferable due to the lower-space required for the treatment unit, high efficiency, and ease of process due to the high filtrated flux owned to the aid of electrostatic force [58–61] . The problems of membrane fouling are minimized due to the electrochemical oxidation of the contaminants. This elongates the life span of the membrane [62] , promotes the compactness of the design [63] , and achieves high removal efficiency and performance at the same voltage. Therefore, a reduction in energy consumption and enhancement in mass transfer due to the drag of the organic contaminants are attained [63 ,64 ].  3.2 Membrane bioreactor Membrane bioreactor (MBR) is a bioreactor that incorporates both aeration and membranes in the organic removal process [65] . This hybrid system is characterized by its ability to treat different kinds of wastewaters, low maintenance requirement, small footprint, low sludge production, and high efficiency [66] . In addition, this system provides high stability of treatment due to retaining the biocatalyst or/and microorganisms. Still, its main drawback is fouling or clogging the membrane which requires frequent cleaning. The cleaning process increases the operating cost due to the applied pressure and also decreases the membrane lifespan [65] . A photocatalytic membrane reactor (PMR) is used to break down complicated large organic molecules into smaller ones with the aid of photocatalysts, thereby, producing mainly carbon dioxide and water [67] . The reactor is featured with the potential energy-saving, the easy separation of photocatalysts from the treated water, overcoming the fouling, and reduction in carbon footprint. However, still the reactor needs a post-treatment (coagulation, flocculation, and sedimentation) to separate the photocatalysts from the effluent in order to improve the water quality [68] . The major operational factors are light wavelength and intensity, photocatalyst properties (surface area, porosity, particle size distribution, and band-gap energy), membrane features, temperature, pH, and working pressure [69] . The two configurations of PMRs are suspended and immobilized photocatalysts [70] .  3.3 Ultrasound technique Ultrasound (US) is a technique that utilizes high oxidant compounds like OH•, H•, and H2 O2  and hydro-mechanical shear forces to break down different toxic and organic pollutants into simple and biodegradable compounds [71 ,72 ]. The drawbacks are the high capital and operating costs and that this process is characterized by the low efficiency for the treatment of large volumes of wastewater with highly variable compositions if used alone. In order to overcome these obstacles as well as to minimize cost and energy requirements, the US process has been combined with other processes like advanced oxidative process, nanotechnology, membrane treatment, and adsorption [73] .  3.4 Hydrodynamic cavitation technology Hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) technology depends on the developing of microbubbles, due to the generated pressure drop, the fluid velocity increase. The collapse of cavities produces active spots with energy enough to dissociate the water molecules into strong oxidative radicals and generate a high mechanical shear force which is enough to degrade of pollutants [74 ,75 ]. All these effects increase the biodegradability of complex compounds and make the treatment easier than the US technique [76–78] . An increase of about 60% in the biodegradability index of polluted wastewater was indicated using the HC technique using a venturi tube at 13 bars for 50 min of process time. Additionally, reduction of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), and color by 32, 31, and 48% were recorded as the effect of cavitation [77] . The merits of the HC process are the increase in biological oxidation [76]  and the reduction in COD value [76]  ought to the breakdown down complex macro-molecular compounds into a micro-molecular ones and the increase in solubility of the organic matters.  3.5 Advanced green technologies Advanced green technologies (AGTs) refer to green technologies that depend on clean energies and non-toxic chemical processes, in addition to monitoring the environment to minimize the negative impacts induced by human activities. The main motive of green technologies is to provide high-end products without compromising environmental sustainability. One of these technologies is the vermifiltration (Fig. 5  ) which consists of a biofilter cultivated with earthworms to enhance the decomposition of organics into compost that can be used as fertilizer. The mechanism includes the passage of the raw wastewater through the activated layer where the organics are transformed into humus enriched vermicompost. Then it passes through filter media which has triple actions of clarifying the effluent, supporting the microorganisms, and trapping the suspended and dissolved solids in the wastewater. The mechanism of the vermifilteration is shown in Fig. 5 . The merits of this biofilter are that it does not clog because earthworms improve aeration by the burrowing action, it could be integrated with other technologies, and it can be applied for the treatment of municipal, industrial, and hospital wastewaters. From the standpoint of the pro-environmental politics, vermifilteration is considered an eco-friendly technology [79] . Studies on vermifiltration reported bacterial, Salmonella, and E. coli removal by 99.9, 96.9%, and 99.3%, respectively [80] . A COD, BOD5 , and total suspended solids (TSS) removal achieved 87.6, 91.3, and 98.4%, respectively [81] . Recently, the vermifilters have been equipped with other processes to enhance the overall efficiencies [82] . These bioreactors were cultivated with plants like Cyprus rotundus [83] , Canna indica [84] , and Carex frankii [85]  to enhance the overall efficiency of the system. Finally, the treated effluent from the vermifilter could meet the standards required for irrigation and agriculture [86] . However, the parameters of operation of the hybrid systems mentioned above should be optimized; for example, in the case of coupling membrane-based treatment method with an electrochemical method, a conductive membrane should be implemented. Most studies are focused on treating synthetic wastewater (one or more pollutants). Future research should discuss the treatment of real wastewater in order to evaluate the overall efficiency of the treatment process [49] . Although it is difficult to assess the data on water quality, international efforts should guarantee the accuracy of these data. Additionally, they should connect the current reporting capacities with future policies. Already, the developed wastewater treatment indicators are being used to set policies and highlight gaps and future measurement requirements. Although there are efforts to get access to safe drinking water and hygienic sanitation worldwide, there are still millions of individuals that lack access to clean water and hygienic sanitation according to resolution 64/292 of the United Nations General Assembly. It is highly recommended to increase the parameters for measurements of well-being [87] . On the flip side, there are some challenges to the recent water treatment technologies to achieve the SDGs, the principles of green chemistry, and the circular the main challenges for the implementation of the hybrid systems on the large scale are the lack of national/international strategies for expanding their applications. Simulation modelling and feasibility studies would facilitate the scaling up. The pH control is another challenge for the widespread of recent technology. Additional efforts are still required in this research area. The role of the chemicals, agents, catalysts, adsorbents, and products of treatment should also be evaluated. In addition, the effect of wastewater treatment on land, air, water, and human should be addressed. Reusing, recycling, and regeneration are important aspects of the circular economy of the materials used in the water treatment process. The slow kinetics of the treatment process is still an obstacle toward the treatment processes. Researchers should explore innovative and alternative agents. However, the materials that are used in water treatment are chemicals that are still far away from the principles of green chemistry. The research should target agricultural, marine, freshwater, and industrial wastes and similar materials to reduce the negative burden on the environment. Some of the recent hybrid systems are expensive, whether because of the implementation of energy for activation or processing, the chemicals and agents of treatment. The biological processes could play an important role here since they are considered low-cost treatment processes.   4 Comparing of the wastewater treatment methodologies and multi-criteria analysis In order to compare different wastewater treatment methodologies, the comparison should consider the environmental, social, and economic impacts (Table 1  ). However, most of the previous studies that investigate LCA are focused only on the environmental aspects. Four phases are included in the LCA: goal and scope definition, inventory analysis, impact assessment, and interpretation of results. However, LCA has some restrictions such as LCA focusing on environmental aspects and it doesn't address other aspects like economic and social impacts, the LCA assumptions may be subjective, the models are limited by their assumptions, the LCA results investigated on global/regional regions, and they may not be suitable for local regions. The accuracy of LCA results may be restricted to the available data [88] . Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment of Evaluations (PROMETHEE), is a multi-criteria decision-making tools that depend on comparing different alternatives to be used with respect to the selected criteria [89]  was investigated to select the best wastewater treatment method [90] . Nano-filtration was selected as the best methodology followed by activated sludge. The methods of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Elimination Et Choix Traduisant la Realité (ELECTRE II) were integrated to weight the different criteria and to evaluate the most suitable wastewater treatment methodology. On the other hand, assessment of the impact of wastewater toxicants on the surrounding environment and human health is accomplished via three approaches as following [91] :(1) Risk analysis and toxicity assessment.  (2) Standard surveys that are mainly based on questionnaires of the exposed individuals compared to unexposed populations.  (3) Bio-monitoring of the main toxic (metals, pesticides and micropollutants) levels in the human bodies under study areas.    Although there are different models of integrated water treatment process, still a gap is present for the decision-makers to select the optimum wastewater treatment process based on the correct criteria [92] . The challenge arises from the fact that there are different characteristics associated with different wastewater treatment plants [93] . Taking incorrect decisions yields high costs, low treatment efficiency, negative economic, environmental, and social impacts [94] . The multi-criteria analysis suggests the best options based on a multidimensional perspective. For example, hierarchy gray relational analysis, nonlinear, linear, and dynamic programming models were studied [95] . An analytical hierarchy approach was implemented [96] . The integration of multi-(MCDA) and a (GIS) were proposed to assess the best location of sewage outlets, sewage treatment plants, and optimum location of landfills [97 ,98 ]. The cost analysis was integrated with the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method to select the sustainable treatment of sludge and sewage [99] . A methodology, based on multi-criteria decision analysis, includes six main steps. It was applied to enhance the design and operation of the water treatment process [100]  (Fig. 6  ). The multi-attributes rating technique was also investigated for the selection of the optimum water treatment process based on sustainability indicators. The photocatalytic membrane reactor was highlighted as the best technology [104] . Fig. (7a)   lists the key parameters in wastewater treatment and the dimensions and objectives that have been chosen to assess the sustainability of the WWT technologies are shown in Fig. (7b) . The general criteria used in the different methodologies for the optimum selection of water treatment processes [100]  are subdivided into five categories; economic, environmental, technical, social, and effluent water quality [100] :(1) Economic: cost/household, sludge disposal cost, technicians and labor required, the possibility of product recovery, the energy required, etc.  (2) Environmental: land, the potential for water recycling/reuse, global warming, greenhouse emissions, odor, risk, sludge production, disposal effect, nutrients and suspended and dissolved solids removal, etc.  (3) Technical: replicability, durability, flexibility, complexity, and treatment degree.  (4) Social: public acceptance and awareness, applicability, reliability, etc.  (5) Effluent water quality: resistance to organic and hydraulic shocks, flexibility, operation stability, removal efficiency, etc.     5 Sustainable development goals (SDGs) There are numerous issues and concerns in societies that require attention and focus by the governments and related public authorities. The fact that industrialisation and urbanization have been augmenting over the past few years, and the need to focus on sustainable development has become critical. Sustainable development could be regarded as development that takes place without negatively affecting or damaging society. In other words, it has been understood as meeting the needs of the present along with compromising the ability of generations to come to meet their own needs [105] . Societies globally have been exposed to varied adversities and challenges such as poverty, environmental degradation, climate change, inequality, justice, and much more. The SDGs in this regard could be identified as the blueprint to attain more sustainability and a better future for all. To be able to develop better SDGs, a critical analysis must be carried out for the particular environment and society. Every country or city may be exposed to a unique set of issues, and so the approach to sustainable development may vary in each case [87] . SDGs could be identified as the goals set on a global level for sustainable and fair health at every level. A broader aim and approach of sustainable development is to mitigate poverty, save and protect the planet, and make sure that individuals enjoy prosperity and peace. The focus of sustainable development is not only on the present but also keenly puts attention to the future aspects as well. Sustainable development is an approach and ideology that influences businesses and individuals to adopt a behaviour that works in favour of societies and communities on the whole [106] . Considering a wider level, if a government establishes a sustainable development approach, the whole country may attain the related benefits and the society could be protected by all means. To be able to incline towards sustainable development, a commitment to social progress is required along with giving attention to economic growth and environmental balance. To attain SDGs, it is also necessary to promote education, initiate fundraising campaigns, promote volunteering, empower change-makers, and many more [107] . In the year 2015, United Nations General Assembly led to establishing SDGs. A set of 17 interlinked goals were set that was designed to be a proposal to attain a better future for all. These 17 interlinked goals could be identified as no poverty, good health, life on land, zero hunger, gender equality, quality education, economic growth, clean water, reducing inequality, affordable energy, sustainable communities, life below water, responsible production, and consumption, climate action, partnership for the goals, peace, industry, innovation, and infrastructure [108] . The SDGs have been inculcated in the United Nations Resolution called as 2030 Agenda. These particular goals are expected to be completed by the year 2030, and they are keenly discussed and evaluated in order to improve the associated results and outcomes. The specific resolution focuses on and identifies particular targets for every goal and indicators that are used to assess the progress towards each set target. Although most of the targets in SDGs are set to be achieved between the years 2020 and 2030, some of the targets do not have any end date. In order to ensure monitoring, varied tools and techniques have been presented that assist in tracking progress towards the goals [109] . The latest data from the United Nations SDGs dashboard showed that most countries still have many challenges, or they still facing significant challenges or facing major challenges in achieving the SDGs targets. Only three countries are doing well in SDG 6, namely Finland, the Czech Republic, and Croatia (Fig. 8  ), nevertheless, the detailed data shows that these three countries are not doing good the SDG 6 targets [110] .  6 Wastewater contribution into SDGs The resource of water could be considered one of the most imperative and critical resources for every development activity. Urbanisation, industrialisation, and population growth have increased the number of users and uses of water, and this has made the resources scarcer and polluted. Due to climate changes caused naturally by human intervention, aspects such as changes in rainfall patterns have threatened to worsen the impact even more. Scarcity of water has become a major issue globally and this has eventually led to a result in being a matter of economic, human, and environmental insecurity [87] . Wastewater until recently was not considered to be something of immense use or benefit, but now it is regarded as a new source of clean water for non-potable and potable uses. Through filtration and treatment of wastewater, the water is being put to use for human consumption along with many other uses such as industrial purposes, irrigation, washing, and much more. Recycled wastewater is being used for numerous purposes and it has the potential to provide various benefits to societies in different forms [111] . Even though wastewater has been identified to be of significant use, a deeper exploration regarding its utilisation could be made to augment the benefits even more. Converting wastewater into reused water has been of immense usage to societies on many different levels. A huge set of stakeholders have been involved in exploring ways and methods through which usage of wastewater could be identified further [112] . With regards to sustainable development, wastewater has the potential to be utilised in numerous forms such as making it safe for drinking purposes and enhanced sanitation to support SDGs. Wastewater could be of various drawbacks to society if not managed well, and so advancements need to be made in this regard to improve the associated outcomes. With regards to the 17 SDGs, the SDG 6 is directly related to water wastewater treatment, ‘ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Through attaining this goal or even attempting to partially achieve, it would lead immensely benefit people on a global level. The significance of clean water for improved quality of life and socio-economic development, inculcating environmental protection and health, is considerably high. Having said this, attempting to make use of wastewater and bringing it to optimum utilisation could be regarded as highly critical [113] . The sixth goal of sustainable development, which is related to clean water and sanitation focuses on improving water quality by reducing the amount of wastewater that is not treated and enhancing safe reuse and recycling globally. Through this, there will be more clean water available for use for individuals which will also lead to huge progress on sanitation and wastewater management. Considering the scarcity of this resource, clean water would never be available if wastewater is not gathered, treated, reused and disposed of adequately. Regardless of its size, every country today is in need of reusing wastewater and putting it to the best possible use by all means [114] . The contribution of wastewater treatment to SDGs can be summarised in the Table 2  . The wastewater treatment plant is essential to achieve eleven SDGs from the 17 SDGs. The main contribution of the wastewater treatment plant is coming from its capabilities on providing clean water and increasing water availability. 6.1 Proposed indicators to improve the wastewater facility into the SDGs The wastewater treatment facility has both positive and negative impacts on the SDGs. Assessment of the negative impacts of water and sewage treatment plants on human health showed that the levels of different heavy metals were located within the permissible limits, some studies recorded higher levels of some heavy metals such as Cd, Ni, Pb, and Cr in treated water from theses sewage treatment plants as well as pesticides such as BHC and DDT in soil receiving the wastewater for irrigation purpose due to the prolonged usage of this treated water in irrigation. The food grains and vegetables are consumed by the cattle as well as human. Subsequently, irrigation with treated effluent must be put the maximum attention in planning any waste management scheme. Moreover, using wastewater with high bacterial biomass or/and solid loading cause deposition on soils [91] . Another assessment for the risks of disinfection byproducts, mainly trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs) and chlorate discharged from wastewater treatment plant (WWTPs) using single or combined disinfection processes showed that inactivation reduced the stability of THM4 and HAA9 while, chlorate remained constant after the inactivation process. In all WWTPs, chlorine alone or combined with UV considerably increased the HAAs, THMs and chlorate levels in the treated water while the same WWTPs changed to peracetic acid or peracetic acid /Ultraviolet as disinfectants, disinfection by-products were completely diminished [115] . In order to minimize these negative impacts of WWTPs, the treated water should be efficiently treated and don't be utilized for the long run. However, to reduce the negative impact a set of indicators were proposed, shown in Table 3  . The proposed indicators were developed based on reviewing the different literature [29 ,87 ,116–120 ].  6.2 Wastewater relation with each SDG SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) was specifically developed to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030. The relation between wastewater treatment and other SDGs Targets is discussed in detail in the following sections. Fig. 9   shows the relation between SDG 6 and other SDGs. The details of the SDG interlinking tool are available in [121] . 6.2.1 SDG 1: no poverty Water and poverty could be considered as associated with each other, as without water, it is impossible to grow food, stay healthy, work, build a house, stay in school, and much more. If there is water scarcity, the probability of breaking out of the cycle of poverty may be very slim. Water is essential for various needs and demands of people and society on the whole. Water is required to run almost every institute present in the society i.e. schools, colleges, offices, and many more [7] . Additionally, societies may not be able to lead towards progress and success. The operational efficiency of all such institutes will be lowered and this eventually would contribute to more poverty in society. For a society or country to progress, it is imperative that it functions adequately and has favourable conditions for working on the whole. Also, farming and agriculture require water as it is the main resource for food production. If farmers do not get enough water, they may not be able to grow crops or carry out related activities, and this eventually would contribute to worse living conditions. The development of a society is also dependent on water availability, as the infrastructure could only be improved through ample availability of water [122] . Water is a critical component used in most human-related activities on a broad level. If a society wishes to progress and move ahead, it is vital to have sustained clean water. Wastewater reclamation has been identified to be one such concept, which could allow countries and societies to meet the need for water availability to carry out the related tasks. With improvements being made in wastewater reclamation and reuse, the stakeholders are involved in processes through which water could be brought to use and utilized in numerous different ways [123] . Wastewater treatment plants hire people to work and thus secure job opportunities that can help in decreasing the number of unemployed workers [124] . Furthermore, new advances in wastewater treatment such as urea fuel cells [125–130] , bio-electrochemical systems that can be used for simultaneous wastewater treatment and water desalination [131 ,132 ], energy “electricity” production [133 ,134 ], or chemical production [135 ,136 ]. Such methods will eventually decrease the cost of fresh water and thus improve the economy of society. Moreover, the wastewater treatment plant could produce a high-quality fertilizer and lower its price, especially for the smallholder [137 ,138 ]. This will lead to an increase in their income and their net profit [139–141] .  6.2.2 SDG 2: zero hunger The time frame from 2015 to 2030 has become a critical and imperative time for progress in global sustainable development. To make sure that a resilient food system and healthy diets are developed, it is vital that there is available clean water. As a part of healthy nutrition, it is vital that there is clean drinking water available to humans all around the world. In many parts of the globe, various individuals are unable to attain clean water, and this has led to an adverse impact on their health. For a healthy diet, it is essential that humans get enough amount of clean water to be consumed each day [142] . Irrigation on the other hand could be regarded as an important component that is related to food, hunger, and nutrition. For adequate irrigation, water is necessary, and wastewater has been identified to be a significant source. It has been well understood that water nutrition is directly linked to each other. In order to grow food, it is essential that there is enough water available for the process and procedures. In most cases, individuals are not able to grow ample food for consumption due to water scarcity, or due to stagnant water. Wastewater in this regard could be considered a highly critical aspect, through which the water could be reused and filtered in order to utilise it for food growth purposes [143] . If the poor have enough water available for crops and food, they would be able to grow it for their families and use it for several other purposes as well [144] . Wastewater reclamation may allow the provision of enough water, which could be used to meet the needs of hunger and other personal needs. For agriculture, clean water becomes critical, and this need could be fulfilled through the management of wastewater. With technological advancements and improvements being made, the process of wastewater reuse and recycling has become more efficient and the desired outcomes are being attained in a more effective manner [142] . Undernourishment is one of the other prevailing issues globally and requires keen attention and focus from the responsible authorities. Individuals living in slums and in under-developed areas are more exposed to the issue of undernourishment [145] . Hunger could be used as a synonym for chronic undernourishment, and this takes place due to the lesser quantity of food available for the individuals. The fact that there are less food growth and production due to limited water availability in various areas, leads to increased hunger among individuals. If wastewater is managed well and put to use in an optimum manner through reuse/recycling, it could augment and assist food growth. Once this happens, the issue of hunger could be catered to well and the objective of zero hunger may be attained in accordance [146] . Further, the higher levels of potassium (K), nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) in the treated wastewater yields positive effect on the crop productivity in the areas receiving it. It was estimated that one ton of produced sludge could generate about 14 kg of N, 6.75 kg of P and 4.25 kg of K [91] . Recovery of the essential macro-nutrient phosphorus from wastewater is gaining increasingly interest, with dwindling sources of phosphorus based fertilizers threatening food security [147] .  6.2.3 SDG 3: good health and wellbeing Raw wastewater contains fungi, bacteria, viruses, and parasites that may lead to cause lung, intestinal, and other related infections [148] . The bacteria caused through it may further lead to cause cramps, diarrhoea, fever, and even headache. There are various health-related issues that could be caused by wastewater and so, there is an immense need to ensure that this could be managed in an effective manner [149 ,150 ]. Through modern WWTPs, the risk of potential diseases is lowered significantly. The disease-causing bacteria are eliminated through the wastewater treatment process including harmful organisms that are bad for human health [151] . Even though these risks and potential adversities are linked to wastewater, less has been done on this aspect and people have been facing numerous difficulties because of this [152] . Moreover, one of the main benefits of the WWTPs is removing the odors from wastewater. One side effect of the WWTPs is increasing the odors but in recent years, this effect was reduced significantly due to the extensive application of nanotechnology or new technologies [139 ,151 ,153 ,154 ]. With a growing population, the volume of sewage has also increased, and this eventually has led to more dangerous chemicals and substances affecting human health. Sewage and wastewater treatments are critical for good human health as the problems rising through this have caused numerous deaths over the years. While certain individuals have fallen sick due to mismanagement and mistreatment of wastewater, some have even lost their lives [155] . With regards to the effects of wastewater on human health, the rural areas have been impacted more in comparison to urban areas. The management and treatment of wastewater are very low in rural areas and so the diseases spread through it are also higher. On the other hand, in urban areas, water management is relatively higher, and the adversities have been controlled to a certain extent. Considering the relationship between the two, wastewater treatment may positively affect the health and well-being of individuals. Improvements made in this regard could allow individuals globally to retain better health and avoid related adversities [144] .  6.2.4 SDG 4: quality education Despite the presence of sufficient fresh water on the planet, people have limited access to it and the condition is worsening day by day. This is due to a bad economy and poor infrastructure in regulating and controlling the supply of water. To achieve the aim of SDGs, it is important to create opportunities that enable the people to gain higher education and various vocational skills that help them to coup these difficulties, as the population of the developing countries lives in rural areas and their livelihood depends on agriculture. According to Cooper et al. [156] , due to the problem of wastewater, the supply of water to farms is reducing, and also contaminating of the fresh supply from wastewater is increasing. This leads to either destruction of agricultural products or affecting their quality. All these adversely affect the income of families in rural areas, which consequently leads to poverty, and in this way, child labor increases as children due to worse family income are forced to work in cities instead of going to school.  6.2.5 SDG 5: gender equality Water as a basic requirement of humans has also impacted the lives of women as a man. However various policies regarding wastewater cause more challenges to women compared to men. When it comes to wastewater, women are more affected than men by the lack of adequate wastewater treatment. As most women work domestically, there are high chances for them to be exposed to unsafe wastewater even while they are working at home or on agricultural farms, etc. It is also one of the tragic of society that most women do unpaid or underpaid work in many sectors especially in agriculture and at a domestic level. According to Herrera [157] , their low income also contributes to exposing them to unhealthy and untreated water for daily household use.  6.2.6 SDG 6: clean water and sanitation The wastewater treatment is important to increase the clear water availability. Whereby clean water is a necessity for individuals today as there are various health issues related to wastewater and sewage. Other than personal adversities, clean water is a requirement for societies and growth opportunities on the whole. For development taking place in society, water could be considered a huge element in it. Without water, it is difficult to incline towards any progress or growth, and so it has become vital to make sure that there is ample clean water available for use. Today, wastewater systems play an imperative role in disease prevention and sanitation by removing harmful bacteria, viruses, and parasites [152] . Societies and governments have been highly focused and inclined toward developing systems that could provide clean recycled water. Clean water and sanitation are critical parts of wastewater management, so resources are being put to use in this regard in order to optimise the associated benefits. The risks associated with wastewater are considerably high, hence implementing effective wastewater management has become essential by all means [158] . The treatment facilities are poor and inadequate in many different locations, and this has an effect on the environment created in the society [159] . Government intervention is considered highly imperative for sewage and sanitation. The policies and initiatives of the government may lead to direct impact on wastewater management, and this eventually could affect the overall condition of society. Wastewater and sanitation could be considered interrelated to each other, as sanitation is the process that mitigates the potential risks and harms caused to humans through wastewater. In order to have clean water, it is vital that wastewater treatment is carried out effectively. It is essential to ensure a safe and clean way to reduce any possible negative effects on groundwater quality [160] . Through improvements made in this regard, the availability of clean water may increase and eventually benefit individuals living in the society [161] .  6.2.7 SDG 7: affordable and clean energy New investments and policies are required in many regions around the world to achieve wise usage of energy for water treatment (Fig. 10  ). On the other hand, production of renewable energy such as hydropower which is considering one of the major producers of electricity around the world is strongly depends on clean water. According to reports in the first quarter of 2020, the use of renewable energy in the global sectors has increased to 1.5% relative to the first quarter of 2019 [162] . Overall, the reports estimate that the entire global usage of renewable energy will increase by about 1% in the year 2020. Wastewater contains a considerable number of organic materials that can be used as an energy source. It is estimated that the internal energy of wastewater is around 6.3–7.6 kJ/L (1.75–2.11 kWh/m3 ) [163] . As a common method, the sludge from different wastewater is usually hydrothermally treated to break down complex organic materials into smaller ones that can be easily used in the anaerobic digester for biogas production. The produced biogas can be directly used after pre-treatment in combustion processes [164]  or as fuel cells for electricity production [165] . Methanation is another method that can be sued for increasing the energy density of the biogas [166] . Meanwhile, from the biogas, a high-quality organic fertilizer is produced that can be used for agriculture purposes. Fig. 10  summarizes the proposed processes [167] . The use of wastewater resources has cut down the price of power generation and thus the utilities are selling affordable energies to the communities. For instance, the San Luis Potosi power plant operated in Mexico had utilized treated wastewater instead of groundwater which reduces the costs by 33%, thus leading to about US$18 million in savings over the six years for the power service Moreover, the Cusco wastewater treatment plant saves about US$230,000 a year in moving biosolids [168] .  6.2.8 SDG 8: decent work and economic growth There are major challenges regarding lack of decent work opportunities, due to insufficient investment and lack of development projects due to slow and uneven progress in various countries, especially in poor and developing countries. The authorities of every country need to formulate sustainable economic growth in societies that allow the citizens to have the opportunity of qualified jobs that stimulate the economic growth for further progress of the country. Indeed, wastewater management is crucial in achieving sustainable development for all. Sustainable employment opportunities can be generated by motivating different investors in the wastewater treatment plant and expanding treatment plants and systems in health sectors and other water-dependent sectors. This will create a vast variety of jobs that required a range of skills, knowledge, and experiences. The government authorities can use different data and information related to wastewater and employment and interact these data for the analysis of the quality of jobs, help them to improve the quality of jobs in the wastewater sector, and lead in providing decent work opportunities to the people in terms of profile, safety, and health. Expanding the wastewater treatment facilities in every country around the globe would likely create a significant number of jobs that will engage a variety of professionals by providing employment opportunities [169] . This will benefit the country in many ways in terms of the economy as investors investing in the treatment plants will facilitate many industries to run to create the necessary tools for the treatment plants (Fig. 11  ). The economy of the country will boost due to the additional external income in the country and also eliminate the problem of unemployment to some extent, especially in developing countries. This will lead to an increase in the GDP. As an example, in China, the analysis of 30 provinces data shows associated relation between high efficiency in wastewater treatment and GDP [170] . Moreover, because most industrial facility depends on water within their operation lowering the cost of the water or recycling will lead to reducing the overall operation cost [171] . In addition, the wastewater treatment facility has the ability to recycle materials such as Value-added products such as crude proteins which could be recovered from poultry wastewater through ultrafiltration, yielding reduction in the COD of process wastewater [172] . Valuable biomass discharged from photosynthetic bacteria (PSB) wastewater has gain a promising trend. This PSB has the potential to develop more high-value materials such as carotenoids, single cell protein, bacteriochlorin, Coenzyme Q10, polysaccharide and poly-β-hydroxybutyrates polyhydroxyalkanoates, polyhydroxy chain alkyl esters, 5-aminolevulinic acid, carotenoids, and bacteriocin, etc. for applications in numerous sectors, such as chemical, agriculture, medical treatment, and food industry as well as treating wastewaters [173] . The Cr(VI) can be harvested from wastewater and enriched by producing FeCr2 O4 , the calcined ash contains Cr2 O3  (45 wt%) can be recycled as an alternative for chromite ore [174] .  6.2.9 SDG 9: industry, innovation, and infrastructure The development and progress of a country especially in terms of the economy depends on its industries, infrastructure, and promotion of innovation in different technologies. When it comes to industry, infrastructure, and innovation in the water industry several advancements are taking place in the treatment of wastewater. Many working groups invested in the manufacture of different tools and techniques in new wastewater technologies. Apart from it, several cutting edge advancements are also taking place in wastewater technologies such as microbial fuel cells [175–177]  for simultaneous wastewater and electricity generation, biohydrogen and wastewater treatment [178–180] , wastewater treatment and water desalination [181] , wastewater treatment and chemicals production [135 ,182 ]. These innovations help to potentially change the methods and procedures that are involved in managing to pay for and gaining profit from the treatment of wastewater. This SDG aims to ensure technological progress in various countries to present solutions for the challenges they are facing in terms of economic and environmental issues. According to Qu et al. [183] , wastewater is the key factor that harms the environment. Therefore, it is required time to promote industries and invest in scientific research and innovation that present an effective infrastructure and technology to curb the hazards that wastewater causes to our environment. This will not only benefit in terms of a pollution-free environment and reduce the ecological footprint but also create a lot of employment opportunities and will assist small-scale businesses in the rural area by lowering the cost of water [184 ,185 ]. This ultimately helps the country to grow and develop its economy. Another benefit to wastewater treatment is adding value to the waste. As an example, the analysis of the olive oil industry in Greece shows that treatment wastewater treatment will add value to their supply chain [186] . Similar studies were conducted for oil palm and other products [153 ,171 ].  6.2.10 SDG 10: reduced inequality Inequality among countries and within individuals is one of the major concerns of the modern world. It is one of the integral aims of the SDGs to reduce inequalities by ensuring that no one is left behind. There are various dimensions in reducing inequalities among nations such as reducing relative income, reducing trade differences and edges, etc. According to Street et al. [187] , the aim of leaving no one behind is to provide opportunities to those with lower income to benefit and participate in cross-border trade and enable economic growth by creating investment opportunities in the country. However, despite the UN struggle in this regard, inequality in the world is rising day by day. When it comes to water, the condition is very serious because the least developed countries have limited infrastructure and access to technology, that's why various countries around the world are facing a major water crisis. Poor structure for wastewater management and treatment worsens the situation more and contributes to an economic and environmental loss in many countries. There are large gaps in accessing the technologies and tools used in the wastewater treatment plant between developed and underdeveloped nations. This causes health and environmental issues in different regions differently affects the lives of people more adversely in underdeveloped countries. Evidence has shown that the likelihood of children dying is much more in developing countries as compared to the developed nation due to water-borne diseases [188] . Treatment of wastewater is very important however due to the utilisation of expensive tools and techniques; it is not in the approach of the people of the most developing nation. The people especially the poor of these nations are therefore at high risk of waterborne diseases and other ailments due to inadequate water supply. Most underdeveloped countries have the problem of installing wastewater treatment plants, as most investors in this sector due to the economic uncertainty of the country do not want to invest in these countries. It is, therefore, the job opportunities in these countries that are limited to effects the livelihood of the common man and it badly affects the already crippling economy of the country. This creates a large gap in terms of equality among nations.  6.2.11 SDG 11: sustainable cities and communities The rapid growth of cities as a result of rising population and raise in migration towards cities required a sustainable development in infrastructure, economy, and all other sectors of the cities. According to El Zein et al. [189] , when a city becomes sustainable, it accommodates and facilitates business opportunities for its citizens. Also, it provides safe and affordable housing to them and in this way, the status of the city enhances in terms of the economy and other business activities. An increase in population will enhance different activities in various sectors. For example, the construction industry will increase its activities to fulfilling housing for the population, etc. These activities need resources and raw materials for their activities. Water is one of the major resources utilized in all these activities along with domestic use. According to various reports, the global water demand is increasing day by day and the situation is more critical in cities [105] . The urban management of water is essential for the city's management authorities. In cities, treatment and management of wastewater are very crucial for maintaining a sustainable environment and climate. It also provides an enormous number of opportunities in terms of treating wastewater as when properly harnessed, it becomes an affordable and good source of water, energy, and other consumable entities. According to Cornejo et al. [190] , wastewater is one of the major challenges for cities as they are considered the hub for wastewater. It is most challenging for the city administrator in managing and treating the enormous amount of wastewater coming from the industries as well as from domestic use. It is therefore very important for the administrators to formulate the city infrastructure and fabrics in such a way that it can coup the challenges coming from the management and treatment of the sewage and of the city. However, unplanned and less manage methods in dealing with these issues will cripple the entire infrastructure of most cities and make the life of people miserable. To develop a sustainable city and community, the city management authorities need to have a planned and efficient wastewater management system, and this can be achieved through good governance and cross-collaboration between people and authorities. Increasing water availability is one of the key pillars to achieving sustainability in the city, Fig. 12  . This will also lead to improving the air quality.  6.2.12 SDG 12: responsible consumption and production Most natural resources that human beings utilising are mostly non-reversible ones, which once consumes cannot reverse back to their original form. To achieve sustainable development and economic growth, it needs time that human must change their way of utilising these resources in the production of different products and consumer goods. When it comes to water, the situation is the most critical one as water is a finite resource and it is utilised in almost entire activities of humans from domestic to industrial use [191] . Agricultural usage of water worldwide contributes to 70% of the freshwater on the planet [192] . The way that human contaminates the fresh water on earth by disposing of toxic waste and pollutants into water streams and the production of a large amount of highly contaminated wastewater by different sectors like industries along with the domestic wastewater contributes major reduction of freshwater availability on earth. Hence SDG 12 is aiming support the circular economy therefore increasing the circulating of the product in the economy and raise their lifespan or lifetime, the treating the wastewater will help in achieving the aim. This will be done by extracting the valuable materials from the wastewater and recycling the water itself [139 ,193 ]. For example, Kurniawan et al. [194]  show how the macrophytes could be used to produce biochar, animal feed, fertilizer, biofuel, and adsorbents from the wastewater. According to Nhat et al. [195] , half of the world population will face major stress in terms of the availability of freshwater by 2050. To eliminate all these consequences regarding water, it is important to encourage and create awareness in public to save this most vital natural resource from contamination and saving them from wasting unwisely. According to De Francisci et al. [196] , it is important to encourage industries and businesses, and other faculties to use water wisely to reduce wastage of water and recycle the contaminated water for reuse after the required treatment. It is the responsibility of the developed nation and various NGOs to support developing countries in facilitating installing wastewater treatment plants so that ordinary citizens can benefit from the supply of fresh water and also conserve this vital resource from wasting due to contamination. This also protects the environment especially the water bodies from pollution and in this way eliminate the hazards of environmental pollution.  6.2.13 SDG 13: climate action Wastewater has a close link with rapid climate changes. This SDG aims to reduce the effects of climate change by regulating and developing the use of renewable energies [197] . Since water is a large source of renewable energy, therefore a portion of wastewater can be recycled and treated chemically to be used for the development of cheap and environment-friendly energy. The wastewater treatment capacity can be increased especially in developing countries to reduce the effects of climate change [198] . The water that is treated with chemicals to remove the impurities and chemicals can then be utilised to develop energy which lowers the use of fresh and underground water resources. According to Dogan and Seker [199] , the development in the renewable sector can reduce pollution significantly and ensures a safe and healthy environment for humans and animals. In addition to this, wastewater recycling is preferred over seawater desalination to develop a sense of added environmental challenges usually linked with desalination [200] . Considering the importance of wastewater treatment, the upcoming years can reduce the usage of the river and lake fresh water in the development of renewable energy. Not only this, the treated wastewater which was returned to the environment can also be utilised in other activities like cleaning, washing, and agriculture. The climate change policy developed by the government obligates the companies to use more renewable resources rather than the traditional power plants for energy generation. Treated wastewater can be utilised to comply with the policies of climate change as it can be used in an environment-friendly energy generation process [201]  This will ultimately lead to reducing the overall GHG emission, especially if the treatment facility took into consideration all GHG emission that might raise from the facility itself [202 ,203 ]. For instance, the development of the renewable sector will help in reducing the emission of CO2  from large power plants and electrical manufacturing industries. Instead of spilling the wastewater into the ground and rivers, industries are now focusing on recycling the resource. The initiative helps to reduce the effects of climate change and acid rain. Not only this, but this will also help to protect the ecosystem from pollution and reduce the rapid climate change that is unpredictable to the specialist. The goals of the policies related to wastewater treatment are to reduce the amount of untreated wastewater that contains sewage litter and other sewage solids that can negatively impact the environment. The policies help to reduce the chronic ecosystem damage and health risk to marine animals. Effective treatment policies and procedures make the treated wastewater return to the environment which will be helpful to maintain river flows for conservation, fisheries, and other recreational interests [204] . The policies of climate change developed by the government make the small and large companies involve themself in the sustainable growth of the environment to make a better planet for all. In addition, the wastewater treatment process has a major role in the biogas industry, which itself contributes to achieving most of the SDGs, not only SDG 13 [167] .  6.2.14 SDG 14: life below water Life below water entails the aquatic ecosystem that consists of animals, plants, and other organisms. A huge amount of fishes and other reptiles live in water and it is imperative to make sure that their lives are protected, and no form of human activity leads to create a negative impact in any case. Wastewater management and life below water could be considered directly related to each other. The contaminated water through human activities is treated and released into rivers, and the water eventually leads to joining the sea. The water, if not treated adequately, will contain chemicals and other substances that are very dangerous for life below water [205] . If the recycled wastewater is not managed efficiently, it may cause death for living organisms, plants, and animals that are part of oceans and seas. Through filtration and treatment of wastewater, the chemicals and substances that negatively affect the life below water could be filtered and made harmless. Treating wastewater becomes critical for life underwater, as it has the potential for causing a long term impact on not only the animals and plants but also the human life related to it [206] . Fishes and other underwater animals are consumed by humans as food in many parts of the world. If wastewater keeps entering the sea, it will majorly affect the animals and their health. Once these animals that have been affected by contaminated water are consumed by humans, the health-related issues may significantly augment. In other words, the consumption of such animals that have been exposed to such wastewater could lead to ultimately major health issues for humans as well.  2.2.15 SDG 15: life land According to studies on land degradation and water, the shortage is closely linked with each other [207] . Healthy land has a natural capability to stock clean water. However, this capacity has vanished when the land is degraded. For instance, poor irrigation management and large volumes of drainage spilt on the soil have reduced the quality of the soil which affects the growth of forests and plants. It is, therefore, necessary to develop policies and strategies to manage and preserve the resources of water and land and reduce the wastewater spill on land. An environmental impact statement (EIS) has been developed to plan the application for the improvement of the wastewater treatment process [208] . According to studies, an EIS is required for every wastewater treatment plant that develops greater than 10,000 PE [168] . The guidelines provided to manage the flow of wastewater help to improve the soil, amenity value, fisheries, tourism, and water quality. Treatment of wastewater is beneficial to protect the lives of land like humans, animals, and other species. According to global water awards, the Paso Robles wastewater treatment plant in the USA is announced as the winner of the wastewater project as it shows the greatest innovation in the context of optimising the physical or ecological footprint to have a huge impact on biodiversity and ecosystem [209] .  6.2.16 SDG 16: peace, justice and strong institution Good practices in anti-corruption are defined as those with a lasting and major decrease in corruption of water resources. The anti-bribery management systems help organisations to analyse, prevent, reduce, and monitor the events of bribery [210] . The certified ISO 37001 Anti-bribery Management System enables the protection and preserves the integrity of wastewater treatment companies among the stakeholders. The certification helps the hydropower generation and water treatment companies to facilitate stakeholders in monitoring and managing the risk related to any illegal activity in the distribution of affordable hydro energy. Moreover, the certification ensures that the suppliers, distributors, subcontractors, and agents are committed to the anti-bribery practice. All the power and utility sectors that are ensuring the treatment and distribution of wastewater are complying with the principles of human rights [211] . Different agencies of hydropower development and wastewater treatment plants have different profiles to protect the rights of employees, consumers, and surroundings. All the stakeholders and the community itself support the concept of wastewater treatments which depicts a higher level of peace and justice in this strategy. To maintain peace and justice, the managers of wastewater treatment projects must show full commitment to the contracts and rules related to sustainable development and growth [212] .  6.2.17 SDG 17: partnerships for the goals Tax policies that are being developed by the government to reduce the use of fresh water and wastewater are much more effective in protecting aquatic ecosystems. The taxes developed by the government are directly dependent on the ecological health position of water and are inversely related to the capacity of discharged wastewater [213] . Taxes approved by the governments aimed at adjusting the market failures. By influencing the activities of the polluting actors, the approved taxes have significantly contributed to the reduction of wastewater discharge and environmental pollution. Moreover, the taxation makes the organisations make some innovations in the wastewater treatment plants which ultimately reflect in reduced deforestation and degradation of land. Ecotaxes that is also known as environmental taxes are governed by the Water Act and are to be paid by the companies at any cost [214] . There are no compensation and exchange policies in the payment of taxes. Irrespective of the revenue that is collected by the wastewater treatment, the taxation policy obligates the companies to improve in the process that ensures a clean and healthy natural environment.    7 Conclusions and recommendations To assist the decision-makers, the contribution of wastewater treatment to SDGs was discussed. The work shows that wastewater treatment contributes directly and indirectly to all SDGs. The most related SDGs are SDG 1: no poverty, by increasing the income of the smallholder, SDG 2: zero hunger by increasing the water that can be used in farming, SDG 3: good health and well-being by improving the water quality, SDG 6: clean water and sanitation, by increasing the clean water availability, SDG 7: affordable and clean energy, through wastewater to energy process, SDG 8: decent work and economic growth, increasing the gross domestic product (GDP) by reducing the cost of water which is essential for all production, SDG 9: industry, innovation and infrastructure, by adding value to the wastewater, SDG 11: sustainable cities and communities, improving the waste management system, by circulating the water, SDG 12: responsible consumption and production, by improving the waste circulating process, SDG 13: climate action, through the production of biogas, and SDG 14: life below water, by reducing the wastewater discharge. This work finds that 1) wastewater treatment could play a major role in achieving the SDGs, 2) Out of 17 SDGs, 11 of them are indirectly impacted by wastewater treatment and other SDGs are directly impacted 3) the industry still facing many challenges for implementation and assessing the targets of the SDGs from a wastewater perspective. It also highlights the interlinkage of the SDG 6 with the other SDGs and that wastewater management plays a vital role in each of the SDGs. Hence, the main challenge to developing indicators on the global level is to help monitoring the risk associated with not achieving this goal. Indicators of this goal should be identified globally. Therefore, the importance of this goal should be brought to the attention of different organizations and governments. The integrated system of policymakers, stakeholders, scientists, and engineers will facilitate and enhance achieving the SDG 6 and also the other SDGs. Furthermore, a set of indicators were proposed to improve the contribution of the wastewater treatment facilities to the SDGs.
