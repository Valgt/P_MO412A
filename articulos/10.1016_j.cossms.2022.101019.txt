Interconnections between Nexus sectors (resource’s energy, water, food, land and climate) may benefit from climate change, energy demand, among others, to sustainable development goals (SDGs) through the integrated planning and management processes [1] . In this context, the role of Nexus assessment plays a catalytic role in achieving all of them simultaneously [1,2] . Therefore, the science and technology fields have been encouraged to design and develop viable solutions for the nexus sectors, as a critical need [3] . In this context, new technologies based on materials science could potentially address challenges of environmental and economic sustainability, meeting various SDGs [4] . For example, advanced materials may help achieving development goals in key areas that focus (i) on the reduction of carbon emissions and on the development of materials for clean energy technologies, (ii) on the potable water and food security and (iii) on antimicrobial action. These priority areas for materials research have contributed with important insights to open novel branches and landscapes for maximizing societal benefits, such as the case of conductive-synthetic diamond films [3,4] . In the last decades, these materials have been the subject of applications and fundamental research in several fields of the science and engineering, such as novel diamond synthesis approaches, surface modification, synthesis of chemicals, electroanalysis, water disinfection, photoelectrocatalysis, sensing, nanotechnology and destruction of persistent/toxic pollutants in water [5,6] . Also, analytical chemistry applications have been investigated, including pH sensors, electrochemical detectors for liquid chromatography, and multidimensional arrays for simultaneous detection of multiple analytes as well as biological micro- and nano- sensors for a wide variety of biochemicals, and in vivo detection of neurotransmitters. Reduction of CO2 , energy storage, organic synthesis, medical, and theoretical chemistry are other examples about the extension of the key advances on diamond materials [7,8] . The present special collection comprises a selection of high-quality reviews, which provides an overview of state-of-the-art, advances and challenges in the conductive-synthetic diamond films related to the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes. Consequently, the core of this Special Issue counts on contributions mainly focused on diamond materials preparation and their surface features [9,10] , energy and storage [11] , water treatment and disinfection [12–14] , electrosynthesis [15,16] , and engineering diamond-reactor developments [17] . In total, the nine articles of this collection, from different countries, underwent a robust peer review screening, ensuring that the quality of the final manuscripts was the highest, according to the expected standards of Current Opinion in Solid State and Materials Science . Several recent reviews have summarized the preparation and electrochemical properties of diamond films; however, some recent efforts have been mainly made for improving the cost-effectiveness and for finding specific applications associated to their surface properties in meeting SDGs, for example SDG2 and SDG7. In this sense, synthesis approaches and their parameters, such as the proportion of diamond (sp3 ) and graphite (sp2 ), boron doping level, crystal size, morphology roughness, substrate nature and diamond surface modifications have been significantly summarized and discussed by Salazar’s group [10] . Si, Nb, Ta, W and Ti have been used as substrates to prepare diamond films with different concentrations of boron doping, as well as in the presence of different diamond/graphite proportions via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthesis method and its variants. They have explained that, the modification of some of these factors, several surface features can be significantly modified, interfering with the charge transfer kinetics at the electrode–electrolyte interface and consequently, modifying the electrochemical conversions and their subsequent reactions. This behavior is mainly exemplified through the production of oxidizing species and electrochemical oxidation of organic pollutants. In view of the different types of substrates used, diamond films deposited on Ti or Nb could be a more operative solution at industrial or commercial level due to its high mechanical stability and the cost per cm2 . On the other hand, the regulation of diamond synthesis parameters and the introduction of nanotechnology as a key functionalization strategy for constructing advanced diamond nanostructures have allowed to establish that exceptional surface properties (electrochemical, chemical, optical and electronic) can be granted for the effective enhancement in the decomposition of dissolved organic pollutants or in the electrosynthesis of chemicals. It was critically discussed by Prof. Salazar and co-workers that surface boron doping level, graphite ratio (sp3 /sp2 ), crystal size and morphology roughness of diamond affect the performance of anodic oxidation process for degrading pollutants in water matrices [10] . Meanwhile, a comprehensive review on the advances in the use of nanodiamonds as electro-oxidation catalysts, photocatalysts, oxidation agents, or adsorbing surfaces has been elaborated by Prof. Bogdanowicz [9] . The author outlines the novel modification strategies of nanodiamonds that significantly enhance the pollutant removal efficiency as well as discusses the facilities that these nanostructures present as electrical charge transfers and their surface regeneration. Eco-technologically speaking, these nanostructures became an interesting alternative due to their wide availability, relatively low costs, specific energy structure as well as a flexible surface susceptible to various functionalization strategies and modifications. The applicability of the electrical properties of diamond surfaces has also been extended to high performance supercapacitors where the development of novel materials for clean energy technologies, in accordance with SDG7, is the main challenge. Prof. Yu, Prof. Yang and co-workers [11]  have reviewed research frontiers in areas related to the design and fabrication of diamond supercapacitors and offered their perspectives on future research. Specifically, the authors emphasized the importance of the introduction of nano-features or nanostructures (e.g., wires, pores) into the flat diamond. These preparation strategies potentially enlarge the surface areas of diamond electrodes by combining them with other sp2  carbon materials as well as with pseudocapacitive materials, bringing in integrated properties and additional capacitance. The authors also highlighted that, the investigations of varied surface terminations, and the possibility of enhancing their surface areas in combination with the selection of electrolytes and the optimal design of supercapacitor configurations offer unprecedented opportunities for building high-performance devices, with big and stable capacitances and high electrical potential and high-power densities. Recently, electrosynthetic methods attract attention in several fields, including the construction of rather complex molecules, the anodic degradation of drug-like molecules, production of high value-added products and so on. On the other hand, significant insights have been reported regarding electrodes and electrolytes, which allow for expansion of the electrochemical window and/or novel reaction pathways. This leads to new electrosynthetic concepts and further applications for technical innovations leading to a set of interactions between the nexus sectors to achieve SDG2, SDG6, and SDG7. Based on coupled nature of anodic and cathodic processes in electrochemical transformations, both reactions can be employed for synthetic purposes. Then, the investigation and application of diamond film as a novel and innovative electrode material is a bright area of research. In this special issue, recent achievements in research on the production of hydrogen peroxide and the underlying mechanisms (using the two-electron water oxidation reaction (2e−  WOR) or two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e−  ORR)) are reviewed by Prof. Espinoza-Montero, Prof. Frontana-Uribe and co-workers [15] . The authors outline the influence of the chemical and physical properties of diamond films in the electrochemical production of H2 O2 , future challenges and opportunities in this field as well as discuss the sustainability and costs of diamond electrodes for H2 O2  electrogeneration. Following in this area of research, the development of green and sustainable electrochemical processes for producing oxidants from abundant and inexpensive starting molecules, such as H2 O2  from O2  and H2 O, is a key scope for many industrial, environmental, medical, and domestic applications. Therefore, the fundamental mechanisms of sulfate, persulfate and peroxymonosulfate activation with diamond anode and their environmental applications are summarized and discussed by Divyapriya and Nidheesh [16] . They summarized the influence of carbon impurities, doping agent and electrode substrate on radical species formation, reviewed the mode of reactivity at different environmental matrices and operational conditions as well as highlighted the importance of hybrid processes to expand the treatment performance as a potential direction for future research. Electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) generating homogeneous (• OH) or heterogeneous hydroxyl radicals M(• OH) have received great attention because they represent a real solution to fulfill SDG6 (i.e., depollution of water, sanitation, disinfection, water treatment as well as their specialized use for monitoring pollutants). Currently, innovative EAOPs have been demonstrated to be robust, safe, eco-friendly (well-fitted with the ideas of the green chemistry) and energy-cost effectiveness-competitiveness water treatment solutions as compared to existing technologies. Among them, persulfate/sulfate-radical-based EAOPs [16] , electrochemical oxidation [13,14] , electro-Fenton [12]  and hybrid EAOPs [10,14,17]  are considered as sustainable water solutions in meeting SDG6. Within this framework, we have invited several leading experts in this field to expose the exciting research now underway; then, five review type articles emphasized water treatment and disinfection as well as the importance of geometrical aspects of different electrochemical reactors equipped with diamond electrodes. Diamond films emerge as a novel and sustainable solution to electrogenerate powerful oxidants for successfully controlling waterborne pathogens in drinking water and for effectively eliminating several toxic and refractory organic contaminants, as alternatives to chlorination or other conventional treatments. Oturan [12]  evidenced that the electro-Fenton (EF) process constitutes one of the most powerful EAOPs with several practical advantages such as oxidation efficiency and mineralization power for treating wastewaters, depending mainly on the in-situ production rate of H2 O2 , which generates homogeneous • OH in the bulk solution via the Fenton reaction. However, the use of diamond electrodes as anodes in the EF process significantly enhanced the effectiveness of this process via the additional production of heterogeneous M(• OH). This review also outlines the importance of the cathodic electrosynthesis of H2 O2  and its integration with electrochemical oxidation (EO) approach with diamond anodes. In this sense, it is clear that the different practical purposes of conductive-diamond films are interconnected to achieve SDG6. On the one hand, the strategies to increase H2 O2  performance using diamond electrodes have also been critically reviewed by Espinoza-Montero and co-workers [15] , while that, on the other hand, the state-of-the-art of EO and its applicability with different diamond materials or as sustainable water solution on wastewater treatments as well as water disinfection, was also discussed in this Special Collection by Carolina Espinoza et al. [10] , Bogdanowicz [9] , Divyapriya and Nidheesh [16] , Martínez-Huitle and Brillas [13] , de Oliveira Silva et al. [14]  and Cornejo et al. [17] . To fulfill the potential of diamond anodes as clean water and sanitation solutions, their environmental applications were mainly summarized and critically discussed by Divyapriya and Nidheesh [16] , Martínez-Huitle and Brillas [13] , de Oliveira Silva et al. [14] , and Cornejo et al. [17]  to electrogenerate powerful sulfate based-oxidants and their activation, to effectively regulate waterborne pathogens in drinking water, to integrate hybrid technologies and to analyze the importance of geometrical aspects of different electrochemical reactors equipped with diamond electrodes, from fundamental studies to pilot plants, in order to accomplish their commercialization as small devices or industrial applications. In the case of the electrochemical disinfection (or electrodisinfection), the use of the conventional chemical oxidizers or reducing agents is avoided, having thus a significant technical impact because it can be easily scaled up or design small–portable devices, benefiting our society. The critical review, written by Martínez-Huitle and Brillas [13] , evidenced the importance of diamond electrochemical methods as alternative for the eradication of waterborne infectious agents from public and drinking waters. Meanwhile, ex-situ and in situ soil remediation processes can be used for removing contaminants contained in polluted soil [14] , transferring them from the soil to aqueous solution, and consequently generating high polluted effluents. However, diamond electrodes for the treatment of soil-washing wastes are considered an efficient alternative as a single approach (e.g.: EO) or combined processes (e.g.: EF, ultrasounds for sonoelectrolysis and irradiation of UV light for photoelectrolysis). These methods are more powerful than individual EO, sonolysis and photolysis because they contribute most effectively to the formation of active oxidant species. We hope that this Special Collection will provide valuable insights and raise overwhelming responses in the broad community of diamond materials, visioning the blueprint of carbon-diamond films in the coming years. Finally, we take this opportunity to thank all authors for their innovative scientific contributions and, in particular, the reviewers whose comments and suggestions were extremely important to achieve high-quality papers, as well as the Editor in Chief, Professor Izabela Szlufarska, for her great support since the initial acceptance of our proposal.
