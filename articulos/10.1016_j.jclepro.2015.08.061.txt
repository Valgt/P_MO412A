In September 2015 the United Nations General Assembly will adopt the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs will only succeed when they are owned by every citizen in the world, and when all are empowered to become change agents. TheGoals.org leverages the latest ICT landscape and mobile connectivity and offers free, high quality education via a mobile first platform with content closely tied to the SDGs, focussing on mobilizing youths' local actions as solutions to global challenges. This article presents the project's rationale, background as well as its accomplished work and work in the pipeline.   Keywords Sustainable Development Goals  Education  Sustainability  Youth    1 Introduction Global sustainable development is the challenge that defines our time. In September 2015 the United Nations General Assembly will adopt the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The UN Secretary-General stressed in the synthesis report on the post-2015 sustainable development agenda “The Road to Dignity by 2030: Ending poverty, transforming all lives and protecting the planet”, released in December 2014, that the SDGs should leave no one behind (UN, 2014a,b ). This also implies that no one – even citizens in the world's poorest countries – should be denied the opportunity to take ownership of the goals and be empowered to become change agents to realise these goals. The SDGs will only succeed when they are owned by every citizen in the world, and when all are empowered to become change agents. For that to happen, we need smart ways to connect this top–down, global agenda with bottom-up local actions.  2 TheGoals.org Learning is pivotal in connecting global development goals to local realities. Advancements in ICT enable new ways of learning that look beyond traditional classroom approaches. Globally, more than ever people have access to the internet; another growing trend is also that more internet access is via mobile phones, particularly among youths in the global south. This new reality means that knowledge and skill-training at all levels can now be offered to population groups all over the world in ways that were not possible only a few years ago, giving us an unprecedented opportunity to raise the first connected generation to be the first sustainable generation. TheGoals.org1  1 See: www.thegoals.org .   evolves from the Young Masters Programme on Sustainable Development (YMP),2  2 See: www.goymp.org .   a global web-based distance education on sustainable development, aimed at high school students and their teachers. Initiated in 1999, the YMP has been developed by the International Institute of Industrial Environmental Economics (IIIEE) at Lund University in Sweden. The course is offered free of charge to all schools worldwide. A unique crowd-learning pedagogy was developed in YMP, building on an exploratory method for learning, where off-line studies of real-life facts alternate with on-line study, discussion and exchange in international virtual classrooms. The YMP was highlighted by UNESCO as a world-leading initiative on education for sustainable development. TheGoals.org is a crowd-learning based joint venture between the International Foundation for the Young Masters Programme (ISYMP) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network (UNSDSN). Its purpose is to support the implementation of the SDGs by communicating them to young people across the globe and by engaging concrete actions to fulfill the SDGs. The project will deliver TheGoals.org, an education platform on sustainable development solutions that:1) provides free, high quality education via the platform with content closely tied to the SDGs, focussing on mobilizing local actions as solutions to global challenges;  2) is mobile first and optimised to work on a wide range of smartphones (affordable to high-end);  3) has an initial capacity to engage over 600,000 learners from more than 100 countries in sustainable development problem-solving.  4) can be distributed cost-efficiently to millions of youth (targeting at <USD5 per user); and  5) collects and showcases local challenges, solutions and inspirational stories, the effects of which can serve as feedback to and enhance advocacy for the international development goals.    Today's young people are “torchbearers” of the future. They must have access to knowledge, inspiration and tools for change so that they can create their future in confidence that a positive development towards sustainability is possible. They are the world's best candidate to be the world's first sustainable generation. The project therefore has set its target group at youth across the globe between the ages of 15 and 19. The projects aims at creating unprecedented experiential learning for massive numbers of young people and engage them in sustainable development problem-solving. With a bottom-up approach on a massive scale, the project is dimensioned to make tremendous global impact as all over the world millions of youth gain insights on development challenges and are inspired to interact with their communities and other users. The platform will be a free place for learning as well as a place to showcase real solutions that are implemented then shared by learners and communities all over the world. Thanks to elaborated feedback mechanisms built in to the platform, better and better solutions to challenges will be collected on TheGoals.org to form a collective intelligence on sustainable development, which can benefit stakeholders at all levels, from local communities to national policies and international conventions. We envision that these millions of youth users – empowered by new knowledge, their own innovative actions and their interactions with peers around the globe – can serve as powerful change agents, paving the way to a more sustainable world. The project has grouped its activities under three interconnected themes, namely Content, Technology and Distribution. Below is a description of what has been accomplished during the first project year (Year 1, Spring 2014–Spring 2015) and what has been planned for the remaining project years (Years 2–4, Spring 2015–Spring 2018). 2.1 Content The objective is to produce SDG-relevant courses with content curated based on scientific and transparent sources and based on engaging pedagogy that inspire learners to initiate problem-solving actions. The content will be presented in ways that are optimised for affordable smartphones. 2.1.1 Finished activities We have designed and established a learning structure designed to engage a very large number of participants to host the course contents. We have established partnership with SDSN; the personnel from SDSN working on TheGoals.org are the same team that supported the SDG Open Working Groups with background materials. TheGoals.org courses will be supported by the same materials. Together we have outlined the courses and their learning outcomes. A few initial courses have been drafted.  2.1.2 Planned activities Our plan is to offer one course for each SDG, plus an introductory course. This means we need to produce content for 12–15 more courses. For all the courses we also plan to make original introductory videos and infographics. Later on we will add a project work module open to learners who have completed all the other courses. Throughout the project period we will have ongoing pedagogical refinement based on user tests results.   2.2 Technology The objective is to create a robust and scalable mobile-first technical platform with intuitive user interface designs to facilitate the courses TheGoals.org. This platform shall support learners accessing the platform with both high-end and affordable smartphones running on different operation systems. 2.2.1 Finished activities We have built a technical platform that supports the learning structure to run on a range of smartphones. We have also built a branded version for the project's first distribution partner, World Organisation of the Scouts Movement (WOSM). Several beta tests (including a large scale, global test) were conducted.  2.2.2 Planned activities The first version of TheGoals.org will be launched at the World Jamboree in Summer 2015; this will be the immediate focus regarding technology. We will continue to develop the platform so that it works on a wider range of smartphones. Further adaptation will be done to facilitate use of platform on laptops and tablets. We will also look into the issue of internet censorship to make sure users in high censorship societies can still access full course content. As the project gains new distribution partners we will build branded versions for them as well.   2.3 Distribution The objective is to cost-efficiently reach hundreds of million users in as many countries as possible. To achieve this, our main strategy is to form partnerships with global organisations and distribute TheGoals.org through them. The project will leverage the power of social media to attract interest and recruit users, and build a global community for TheGoals.org. 2.3.1 Finished activities The project has confirmed distribution partnerships with WOSM and Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE). Together, TheGoals.org, WOSM and FEE have a presence in 175 countries with an aggregated potential reach of over 100 million youth users. We have also built in a mechanism in the course design that when learners have finished an assignment, the system will generate assignment stories that are fully shareable both on the platform and to social media platforms, including Facebook and Twitter.  2.3.2 Planned activities We will continue to pursue more distribution partnerships, regionally and globally. We will promote TheGoals.org through existing global partner networks and organisations, including UNESCO, UNSDSN, WOSM and FEE. Further down the line we plan to establish a global ambassadors network for TheGoals.org. We will maintain active communication activities aimed at serving partners and establishing a global community for TheGoals.org.    3 Conclusion An initiative like TheGoals.org would be a daunting task just a few years ago, as it would require massive amounts of resources to even make it possible. Nowadays, however, advancements in ICT have provided excellent conditions to do it effectively and cost-efficiently. Globally, more than ever, people have access to the internet; as suggested a growing trend also shows that more internet access is via mobile phones, particularly among the youth in the global south. This new reality means that knowledge and skill-training at all levels can now be offered to population groups globally in ways that were not possible only a few years ago. Affordable smartphones and improved infrastructure in the least development countries make it possible for people to access the internet via mobile devices. Young people today are very likely to become the first connected generation. The world is facing an unprecedented opportunity to raise this first connected generation to be the first sustainable generation, if only we can empower many of them to take actions for sustainable development.
