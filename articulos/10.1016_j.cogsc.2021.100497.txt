                  Since the launch of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, the SDGs have been widely adopted by governments and corporations in an effort to improve their sustainability. There are 17 SDGs, comprising 169 targets, which are measurable against 247 unique indicators. Despite pervasive global pollution from (micro)plastics, there is only one indicator (14.1.1b) under Goal 14, specifically related to reducing impacts from (micro)plastics. Reliable reporting and monitoring of 247 SDG indicators present unique challenges for governments and organizations to implement, which may be further exacerbated by the pervasive nature of (micro)plastic pollution if not properly monitored across these indicators. This review focused on recent literature to provide a critical overview of the key challenges specifically related to (micro)plastics as they may undermine the implementation of sustainable strategies and action plans required to achieve the UN SDGs.

This reviews comes from a themed issue on Microplastics (2021)  Edited by Teresa Rocha-Santos  and Catherine Mounyrac  Available online 15 April 2021 Since the launch of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, the SDGs have been widely adopted by governments and corporations in an effort to improve their sustainability. There are 17 SDGs, comprising 169 targets, which are measurable against 247 unique indicators. Despite pervasive global pollution from (micro)plastics, there is only one indicator (14.1.1b) under Goal 14, specifically related to reducing impacts from (micro)plastics. Reliable reporting and monitoring of 247 SDG indicators present unique challenges for governments and organizations to implement, which may be further exacerbated by the pervasive nature of (micro)plastic pollution if not properly monitored across these indicators. This review focused on recent literature to provide a critical overview of the key challenges specifically related to (micro)plastics as they may undermine the implementation of sustainable strategies and action plans required to achieve the UN SDGs.   Graphical abstract Image 1        For complete overview of the section, please refer the article collection - Microplastics (2021)       Introduction Plastic pollution is pervasive affecting marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems globally [1 ]. Once plastics enter the environment, they continuously break down into increasingly smaller particles called microplastics (MPs) (<5 mm) [2 ]. Owing to low degradation coupled with unsustainable production, use, and disposal, plastics and microplastics (hereafter referred to as (micro)plastics) have become a severe transboundary threat to natural ecosystems and human health [3 ,4 ]. In 2019, global plastic production reached 368 million metric tons (Mt) [5 ] but is estimated to double within 20 years [6 ]. As most consumer plastics are designed for only single-use, this has resulted in increasing quantities of plastic waste [7 ]. Borrelle et al. [1 ] estimated that 19–23 Mt of plastic waste generated globally in 2016 entered aquatic ecosystems but is predicted to reach up to 53 Mt annually by 2030. Thus, (micro)plastic mismanagement threatens the ability of the global community to sustainably manage plastic production, use and disposal. As global plastic production continues to rise, so does the number of national and international commitments to reduce (micro)plastic pollution. Increasingly, national governments are banning or placing levies on single-use plastic products [8–10 ]. At the international level, the United Nations (UN) has made commitments to reduce plastic leakage into the environment. For example, these commitments include Addressing Single-Use Plastic Products Pollution, the UN Environment Assembly Resolutions Marine Litter and Microplastics, and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [11 ].  The UN SDGs The UN announced the launch of the SDGs at the UN summit in September 2015. The UN SDGs were developed to address the most important global threats of our time and provide a vision for achieving a sustainable future. The UN SDGs are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. There are 17 universal goals for 2030 (Figure 1  ) [11 ], each providing guidelines and 169 specific targets in which goals may be measured and achieved. The issues related to marine plastics are being addressed internationally by the UN and by individual countries at national, subnational, and supranational levels, including regional levels [12 ]. At the global level, the issue of marine (micro)plastics has been recognized in the UN SDGs under Goal 14 which is to: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.  Specifically, in target 14.1: By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution.  This will be measured by indicator 14.1.1: Index of coastal eutrophication and floating plastic debris density.  Thus, a reduction in the density of floating plastic debris is understood by the international community as being central to the sustainable use of the oceans. However, an internationally accepted index of floating plastics debris density does not currently exist. The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) has taken a lead role in coordinating actions within the United Nations System to address marine plastics. Of particular relevance, UNEP is working with a wide range of UN entities to coordinate the Joint Group of Experts on Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection (GESAMP) [13 ]. GESAMP is playing an important role in working toward coordinated, science-based solutions to reduce marine plastics litter. Among other important initiatives, UNEP is working toward subindicators for reporting on marine plastics in the context of SDG Indicator 14.1.1b. GESAMP has developed potential subindicators, which include monitoring and reporting on beach litter, floating plastics, water column plastics, microplastics, plastics ingestion, and seafloor plastic. Although there are 17 SDGs, comprising 169 targets that are measurable against 247 unique indicators, there is only one indicator (14.1.1b) under Goal 14, which is specifically related to reducing impacts in the marine environment from plastics. For all other SDGs, there is no specific mention of targets aimed at reducing (micro)plastics or indicators to measure their reduction (Figure 1 ). Therefore, this presents immense challenges for governments and organizations attempting to implement reliable reporting and monitoring of other SDGs because of the pervasive nature of (micro)plastic pollution impacting the environment, society, and the economy. This review focused on recent literature to provide a critical overview of the key challenges specifically related to larger plastics and smaller microplastics to implementing sustainable strategies and action plans required to achieve the UN SDGs. This critical review identified at least 12 UN SDGs that are directly or indirectly impacted by (micro)plastic pollution (Table 1  ). Although not exhaustive, recent (micro)plastic articles (most published within the last 2 years), relevant to each of these 12 Goals are discussed.  Goal 1. End poverty in all its forms everywhere Although there are no plastic targets or indicators related to this Goal, a commonly held assumption by the plastics industry is that increased plastic use will improve the lives of those in poorer nations where potable water may be unavailable, resulting in increased use of plastic sachets or bottled water for drinking [14 ]. However, plastic debris has been linked with destructive flooding causing stagnation of waterways creating breeding grounds for mosquitoes and vectors for cholera [8 ]. Although there have been economic benefits in the global plastic waste trade for developed and developing countries, as well as informal waste pickers, plastic waste also has negative impacts on people's livelihoods [15 ]. One recent viewpoint article describes the direct relationship between the proliferation of marine plastic and negative impacts on ecosystem services and severe negative economic impacts on communities, most notably in poorer coastal communities. The study reported that plastic pollution costs society up to US $2.5 trillion per year based on an estimate that plastic waste costs up to US $33,000 per ton in reduced environmental value [16 ]. Thus, implementing this Goal poses a challenge without adequate plastic reduction or monitoring targets.  Goal 2. End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture The sustainability of our food systems depends on the soil, ocean, and aquatic ecosystem health, yet a recent growing body of evidence reports of (micro)plastic accumulation in agricultural soils [17 ], fruits and vegetables [18 ], and seafood [19–23 ]. The presence of (micro)plastics in agricultural soils and aquatic biota poses potential risks to human health through ingestion in foodstuffs such as bottled water, beer, salt, and bivalves [24 ]. One recent study has reported that plastic food packing itself is a source of (micro)plastics in food consumed by humans [25 ]. These studies, and many others not included here, provide overwhelming evidence of seafood and soil contamination by (micro)plastics that have potential consequences for human food security, food safety, and health.  Goal 3. Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages It is now indisputable that microplastics have been found in the human body, including the human placentas [26 ,27 ]. Pathways of exposure include ingestion (through consumption of microplastics in seafood and other food products discussed in Goal 2), inhalation, and dermal contact because of the presence of microplastics in food packaging [25 ], food [18 ,23 ], and even the air we breathe [28–30 ]. Microplastics entering the human body through ingestion or inhalation can be taken up in various organs and impact human health, by damaging cells or inducing inflammatory and immune reactions [31 ]. However, there remain large knowledge gaps in our understanding of the potential impacts that microplastics have on human health. Until these knowledge gaps are properly understood, implementing this Goal to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all ages remains a challenge.  Goal 6. Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all Similar to the challenges posed by (micro)plastics for implementing Goals 2 and 3, there is a growing body of recent literature reporting the presence of (micro)plastics in drinking water and treated wastewater effluent [32–35 ]. The World Health Organization has recognized the presence and potential hazards of (micro)plastics in municipal and bottled drinking water. However, the presence of (micro)plastics in drinking water from treatment plants varies widely from undetectable to >900 particles/L and largely depends on water sources, plant design, and methods used for analysis. (Micro)plastics found in bottled drinking water have been linked to the plastic packaging material itself and frequent wear [36 ]. For example, numbers of particles released increases with the frequent reuse of plastic bottles [32 ]. Despite their relatively efficient removal rates of 90–99%, wastewater treatment plants are also point sources for releasing (micro)plastics into the environment [33 ,35 ]. (Micro)plastics are released both directly in aquatic ecosystems via effluent release and indirectly to agricultural soils via biosolids amendment application. Although (micro)plastic removal rates from wastewater effluent are high, the sheer number of (micro)plastic particles entering wastewater treatment plants via polypropylene microfiber shedding from laundry, microplastics in exfoliating products, and other sources still pose serious challenges to implementing sustainable management of water and sanitation for all [33–35 ].  Goal 7. Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all In many jurisdictions around the world (e.g. Taiwan), energy recovery from municipal plastic waste has been viewed as a preferred option for landfilling or leakage into the environment. However, incineration of plastic waste has been considered a last resort on the waste management hierarchy [37 ]. The unsustainable use of plastic waste for energy recovery has been widely criticized recently because of the release of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [38 ]. Using a cradle to grave assessment, one study reported that GHG emissions from plastics globally will reach 1.34 gigatons per year by 2030 and 2.8 gigatons per year by 2050 [39 ], providing evidence that using plastic waste for energy recovery contrary to the aspirations of achieving Goal 7.  Goal 9. Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation There needs to be a dramatic shift in the current linear plastics economy to achieve this Goal. Innovation is required to move from reliance on unsustainable fossil fuel-based plastics to sustainable bio-based plastic alternatives to help contribute to a circular economy [37 ,40 ]. Although bio-based plastics may offer a sustainable alternative, they account for <2% of plastics, because of low-cost of fossil-based plastics, intense requirement for land use, and undeveloped recycling options. Therefore, cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment of bio-based alternatives is urgently required [37 ]. Impacts of fossil fuel–based plastic production and waste are indisputable and seriously threaten the implementation of many UN SDGs. For example, plastic production from fossil-based sources and plastic waste incineration (discussed in Goal 7) accounts for 400 million tonnes of CO2  emissions annually [41 ]. However, to improve management of the current unsustainable increase in plastic waste, various approaches have been used to recycle plastic into construction and other materials to help achieve this goal [42 ]. Different physical properties of plastics are suited to a range of different construction applications. For example, rigid high-density polyethylene is well suited for use in plastic lumber, table, and chairs, whereas flexible low-density polyethylene is better suited for construction use in bricks and blocks. Hard and flexible plastics such as polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate have been widely used in asphalt and cement composites [42 ].  Goal 10. Reduce inequality within and among countries The global plastic waste trade has been the recycling model used by many countries for decades [43 ]. It has also been widely criticized as a form of plastic pollution transfer from developed to developing countries [44 ,45 ]. Although this global circular economy has benefitted high-income countries, it has transferred the burden and true environmental costs of plastic pollution to low-income countries. Until recently most recyclable exports were shipped to China, but in December 2017, these imports were banned [46 ]. This caused a global shift in plastic exports, much of which switched to other Southeast Asian countries, which quickly became overwhelmed with plastic waste [44 ,45 ,47 ]. Poor-quality plastic waste and lack of waste management infrastructure result in unreported plastics being landfilled, incinerated, or leaking into the environment [43–46 ]. All these scenarios are unsustainable and lead to widening inequalities between developed and developing countries.  Goal 11. Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable Similar to Goal 10, indiscriminate disposal of plastics in countries with inadequate waste management systems is choking critical urban infrastructure, such as drains and sewers leading to widespread and unsustainable plastic pollution in urban areas [1 ,8 ,48 ,49 ]. Implementation of this Goal will remain a serious challenge until plastic production, use and mismanagement is properly addressed by governments, corporations, and consumers.  Goal 12. Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns A plethora of recent studies has documented some staggering statistics related to unsustainable global plastic production, plastic consumption, and plastic waste mismanagement [1 ,6 ,45 ,50 ,51 ]. As of 2015, an estimated 8300 Mt virgin plastics have been produced to date of which 6300 Mt is now waste. Only 9% has been recycled, 12% has been incinerated, and 79% is now in landfills or the natural environment [50 ]. Annual global plastics production is estimated at nearly 360 Mt and is estimated to double within 20 years [6 ]. Of this, almost 50% is destined for single-use, particularly food packaging [7 ], leading to unsustainable plastic waste generation. A recent study by Borrelle et al. [1 ] estimated 19 to 23 Mt, or 11%, of plastic waste generated globally in 2016 entered aquatic ecosystems (seriously threatening the success of implementing Goals 2, 3, 6, and 14 among others). This could reach up to 53 Mt per year by 2030, which undermines the success of Goal 12 as well. To ensure sustainable consumption, production, and to reduce (micro)plastic waste, extraordinary efforts (such as dramatically decreasing production and consumption of plastics, develop circular economies where end-of-life plastics are valued rather than becoming waste and dramatically increase domestic recycling rates without relying on the global plastic waste trade) are required by the international community to achieve this Goal [1 ].  Goal 13. Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts Plastic polymers are derived from fossil fuels and plastics account for 6% of global oil consumption [52 ]. Therefore, plastics and GHG emissions are intricately connected with every step of the plastic life cycle, from production to transportation to waste disposal, contributing to climate change [41 ,53 ,54 ]. Thus, unsustainable production, use and disposal of plastic is impacting our climate by releasing GHGs during production, use though to waste disposal or incineration [39 ], thereby undermining the ability of the international community to implement this Goal.  Goal 14. Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development This is the only Goal that specifically addresses plastics (i.e. indicator 14.1.1b plastic debris density), but does not address microplastics (i.e. plastics <5 mm). Although (micro)plastic pollution has been widely recognized as a planetary threat, affecting nearly every marine and freshwater ecosystem globally [1 ,55 ], there is currently no standardization in approaches or an internationally agreed protocol to measure this indicator. At present, quantification of floating plastic marine debris (>2.5 cm), relies mainly on visual observations by citizen scientists [56 ]. However, recent studies have proposed the use of citizen scientists to help quantify floating debris through participation in marine debris clean-ups organized by organizations such as Marine Debris NOAA, International Coastal Cleanup (ICC), or Litter intelligence [57 ,58 ]. The UN Environment, the custodian agency for this indicator, is currently developing a methodology that uses citizen science data as a primary source of information for measuring marine plastics on beaches and shorelines [58 ]. Although the use of citizen scientists is encouraging to help quantify and monitor trends for this Goal, the threat from microplastic pollution is still not recognized by this Goal.  Goal 15. Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss Most (~80%) marine (micro)plastic pollution is derived from land-based sources [56 ], but until recently, most (micro)plastics research has focused on marine and aquatic ecosystems [59 ,60 ], yet terrestrial ecosystems are estimated to receive 4–23 times more (micro)plastic waste annually [60 ]. Although research on (micro)plastic pollution in terrestrial soil ecosystems has been lacking, the detection, occurrence, characterization, and toxicology of microplastics in soil ecosystems has recently drawn considerable attention [61 ]. Microplastics have been shown to affect soil physical and chemical properties, microbial and enzyme activities, plant growth, and also pose adverse ecotoxicological effects to soil fauna [59–61 ]. Sources of (micro)plastic inputs to terrestrial ecosystems have been linked to poor waste management (leakage), application of biosolids to agricultural soils [62 ,63 ], and via atmospheric microplastic deposition that has been reported in remote, pristine mountain catchments such as the French Pyrenees [28 ] and protected areas in the US (e.g. Rocky Mountain National Park) [29 ]. Like many Goals discussed in this critical review, there is currently no indicator to monitoring the impacts of (micro)plastics in this Goal, which again undermines the likelihood of successful implantation of this Goal by 2030.  Conclusion and outlook Although the most serious threats to our planet are addressed through 17 SDGs, only a single indicator under Goal 14, specifically relates to reducing impacts from plastics. For all other SDGs, there is no specific mention of targets aimed at reducing (micro)plastics or indicators to measure their reduction assuming any baseline data exists. This presents immense challenges for governments and organizations attempting to implement reliable reporting and monitoring of other SDGs because of the pervasive nature of (micro)plastic pollution impacting the environment, society, and the economy. This critical review identified at least 12 UN SDGs that are directly or indirectly impacted by (micro)plastic pollution. Thus, it is recommended that at least 12 of the UN SDGs be updated to collect baseline data against which future monitoring and reporting can be compared to address the transboundary threat of (micro)plastics to avoid undermining successful implementation of the wider goals of the UN SDGs.
