                  The seventeen United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) present a major challenge to soil scientists that have, so far, not been involved with defining SDG targets and indicators. Soil functioning contributes to ecosystem services (ES) that, in turn, are important to achieve land-related SDGs, including: (1) biomass production (SDG2); (2) improving ground- and surface water quality (SDG6):(3) carbon capture for climate mitigation (SDG13); (4) limiting greenhouse gas emissions (SDG13) and (5) biodiversity protection and enhancement (SDG15). Pedological expertise, based on the study of soils in their natural environment, is valuable when defining the role of soils in inter- and transdisciplinary programs aimed at assessing ESs that, in turn, define SDGs by providing: (i) data from soil types, considering soil profile characteristics, such as occurrence of macropores and particular soil horizons, as no soil is homogeneous nor isotropic. This should include effects of management as expressed by phenoforms, and (ii) a developing “storyline” for a particular soil type based on successive determinations of ESs, obtained at different locations. Storylines are important for communication purposes addressing stakeholders, the public at large and the policy arena. Current empirical soil survey interpretations are inadequate to assess ES but modeling of the soil-water-atmosphere-plant system can provide relevant ES data, also by exploring future effects of climate change as is illustrated in three case studies..

Keywords Soil survey interpretation  Land evaluation  Interdisciplinarity  Transdisciplinarity  Simulation models    1 Introduction Contributions of soil science are increasingly acknowledged in the policy arena to be important for achieving Sustainable Development, as expressed by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (UN, 2015 ) and, more recently, by the European Green Deal (EU-GreenDeal.com). A series of reports has emphasized different aspects contributing to the targets and indicators for both efforts. For example: (i) The CAP 21 climate accord included the: “4per1000″ proposal aimed at increasing the organic matter content of soils as a climate change mitigation measure (https://www.4p1000.org). (ii) The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) has advocated soil management measures to combat desertification (https://www.unccd.int/publications  ). (iii) A recent report by the International Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) on Land Use also emphasized the importance of land-use change and soil-specific management for climate mitigation and adaptation (IPCC, 2019 ). (iv) The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) has made recommendations to combat soil degradation (IPBES, 2018 ). (v) The European Academies of Science have explored soil sustainability in Europe (EASAC, 2018 ) and (vi). The new research program of the European Union “Horizon Europa”for 2021–2027 is based on five missions, one of them: “Soil Health and Food” (EC, 2019 ): (https://ec.europa.eu/info/horizon-europa  ). How has the soil science profession positioned itself in this context? So far, soil scientists have not contributed to defining targets and indicatores for the SDGs (Bouma et al., 2019 ). As the SDGs represent international commitments to achieve goals by 2030, this non-engagement is problematic. Soil science can offer many contributions by its various subdisciplines but this paper will argue that contributions by quantitative pedology, defined as: “the integrative study of soils in their natural environment”, are particularly effective. Soil classification systems define specific soil types (e.g.Wilding et al, 1983; Soil Survey Staff, 2014; IUSS Working Group WRB, 2014 ). Following soil surveys, soil survey interpretations (Soil Science Division Staff, 2017 ) or land evaluations (FAO, 2007 ) are prepared aimed at a wide variety of land uses, reflecting expert knowledge in terms of described limitations. In contrast to other areas of pedological research such as digital mapping, database development and geostatistics, relatively little attention has been paid to develop more quantitative forms of soil survey interpretation which are needed to allow significant contributions to the SDG debate aimed at reaching the goals. Of course, soil scientists cannot by themselves adequately address the SDG challenge. Inter- and transdisciplinary approaches are needed and the task of soil science is to deliver effective contributions to such inter- and transdisciplinary studies on ESs. that, in turn, contribute to realizing land-related SDGs (e.g. Bouma, 2014, Keesstra et al, 2016 ). Stating that, for example, biomass production is a soil function (EC, 2006 ) ignores the fact that agronomy and many other scientific disciplines are essential to produce biomass. So rather than distinguish soil functions in this manner(e.g. Bampa et al., 2019 ), attention is focused here on contributions that soil science can make to interdisciplinary studies of ESs. Focusing attention in this paper on agriculture, the following ecosystem services can be distinguished, each one linked to the corresponding SDGs: (1) biomass production (linked with SDG2: zero hunger); (2) improving ground- and surfacewater quality (linked with SDG6: clean water and sanitation):(3) carbon-capture for climate mitigation (linked with SDG13: climate action); (4) limiting greenhouse gas emissions (linked with SDG13) and (5) biodiverity protection and enhancement (linked with SDG15: life on land). In fact, current environmental regulations in many countries require farmers to meet threshold values for ES 2, while pending legislation is likely to cover ES 3, 4 and 5 as well in future. This has important operational implications for the codification aspect of the recently proposed Global system for soil security (Field et al., 2017 ). Farmers have the difficult task to select management measures that can satisfy the requirements of the various ESs. This requires a fundamentally different approach beyond collecting expert knowledge based on existing management that is usually focused on production only and could imply the need for application of dynamic process models, to be discussed later. Such models provide quantitative assessments of the soil-water-atmosphere-plant system. An important feature of such models is an integrated systems approach, where calculated biomass production as a function of management is connected with associated fluxes of water and nutrients, defining soil conditions that are relevant for ES 1 to 5. Such simulation models are widely available (e.g. Jones et al., 2003; Reynolds et al., 2018; Kroes et al, 2017; Hack-tenBroeke et al., 2019; White et al, 2013; Kersebaum, 2011; Holzworth et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2012  and others). Modeling is also important when defining soil conditions, soil capability and soil capitol as distinguished in the recently proposed concept of Global Soil Security (Field et al, 2017 ). Simulation models need soil data, that can be derived from by now widely available and accessible geo-referenced soil databases with varying grid sizes (for example: the USDA database (https://websoilsurvey.ncrs.usda.gov  .; ISRIC (World Soil Information (http://www.isric.org  ) ; European Soil Database (ec.esdac@ec.europa.eu)  and the large LUCAS (Land Cover/Use Statistics) database for Europe (Orgiazzi, et al, 2018 ) and other databases. Soil data consist of sets of soil parameters (e.g texture, bulk density, organic matter contents etc.) for different soil horizons. However, representing soils by sets of seperate soil parameters for any given grid-point deviates from traditional soil survey approaches where pedology considered “representative”soil profiles, associated with mapping units on a soil map, with characteristic sets of associated properties. Soil types were thus used as “carriers of information” or “class-pedotransferfunctions” for areas of land (Bouma, 1989; van Looy et al., 2017 ). But current empirical soil survey interpretations are inadequate to define soil contributions to interdisciplinary studies on ESs and questions can also be raised about use of single soil parameters from soil databases. What can pedology offer? The following issues will be discussed: (i) The focus on existing expert knowledge in current soil survey interpretations is inadequate to answer modern land use questions land-related SDGs. Can dynamic process modeling overcome this problem and what can be the role of pedology in this context? (ii) The link with pedology, defining soil types, is lost when limited sets of seperate soil parameters are derived from databases for grid points, often followed by introduction into pedotransferfunctions to be used by modelers. What are the risks of mining soil databases without pedological expertise? (iii) What is the role of field research in future, now that most traditional soil mapping programs are completed?; (iv) How to engage critical stakeholders in the post-truth information age as operational soil management questions become more urgent? Can the storylines of pedology, linked with particular soil types, be helpful, also for general communication purposes reaching the policy arena and the public at large.?  2 Empirical judgements versus dynamic modeling. Traditional soil survey interpretations (Soil Science Division Staff, 2017 ) or land evaluations (FAO,2007 ) are based on expert knowledge estimating the relative soil suitabilities or limitations for a series of land uses without providing specific advice as to what can be done to overcome limitations. Recent Decision Support Systems (DSS) have extended the impact of expert knowledge by systematically collecting management information. For example: a DSS was developed in France to assess and manage the primary production function on their agricultural fields (Sanden et al, 2019 ). The innovative NAVIGATOR-DSS considers all five ecosystem services rather than only the production service. (Debeljak et al, 2019, Bampa et al, 2019 ). Development of the expert knowledge in NAVIGATOR was based on contacting 470 farmers during 32 interactive workshops all over Europe. Thus, stakeholders were engaged right from the start of the research program which is a requirement for success (e.g. Reed, 2008 ). But expert knowledge has its limitations: not all experts agree on what is important and systematically assembling existing expertise creates no new knowledge but distributes existing knowledge. This is useful but new and quantitative knowledge is needed for soil scientists to face the challenges of the future, such as: mitigating effects of climate change by carbon capture and reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions, dealing with genetically modified crops, improving the effectiveness of the soil biome, enhancing biodiversity and nutrient use efficiency and introducing more refined precision techniques in agriculture. For example, Bonfante and Bouma (2015)  addressed effects of genetic engineering and climate change on land use options. To answer such modern land use questions, soil scientists should connect with specialists of other disciplines and discuss which soil data are needed in their models. Process modeling of the soil-water-atmosphere-plant system as widely applied at this point in time by agronomists, hydrologists, ecologists and climatologists, is fundamentally different from collecting experiences of advisers and stakeholders. It applies objective scientific principles that uniquely allow exploration of effects of future developments for which no existing experience can be tapped.  3 Three case studies An example of quantitative land evaluation was presented in the Water Vision Agriculture approach by Hack-tenBroeke et al. (2019) , using the Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant (SWAP)-and The World Food Studies (WOFOST) simulation models to express the effects of different water management practices on soil productivity. Also effects of salt intrusion into agricultural production systems, resulting from climate change causing sea-level rise, was assessed. Soil scientists cooperated with agronomists, hydrologists, dairy scientists and economists. A meta-model was developed applying random-forest techniques based on a very large number of simulations with SWAP-WOFOST, focusing on 72 soil types in the Netherlands. The meta model characterized 15 crops, data from 5 weather stations and 100 lower boundary conditions for the flow system representing different groundwater dynamics. The meta model was particularly attractive for policy issues. This study covered ESs 1 (related to SDG2) and 2 (related to SDG6). In future other services will be covered and then knowing the soil moisture regimes will be useful when defining management measures allowing Carbon capture (related to SDG13), reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (related to SDG13) and improvement of biodiversity (related to SDG15). Another example was presented by Bonfante and Bouma (2015)  for the Destre Sele area in Italy where farmers, suffering from drought, were besieged by both irrigation manufacturers and plant breeders, promoting as a cure-for-all-ills either new innovative irrigation systems or new genetically manipulated maize varieties with a high drought resistance. Running the SWAP simulation model indicated that the six soil series in the area acted significantly different when subjected to different irrigation regimes and to growing new crop varieties. In both studies the soil series functioned as class-pedotransferfunctions. This study covered ESs 1 (related to SDG2) and 2 (related to SDG6). For other ESs the above comments for the Hack-tenBroeke et al. (2019)  study apply. Dominati et al. (2014, 2016)  studied economic and land-use aspects of the Horotio and TeKowhai soil series in New Zealand, focusing on dairy systems. Their ecosystem approach, quantifying soil performance for multiple outcomes, including an economic evaluation of ecosystem services, was presented as a possible “future of land evaluation”. All the above mentioned SDGs were also addressed in these studies, that continued and built on earlier work by Robinson et al. (2013) . These studies also reported values characterizing soil condition, soil capability and soil capital, as distinguished for Global soil security (Field et al, 2017 ). Two questions can, however, be raised about these studies:(i) the SWAP, SWAP-WOFOSTand SPASMO (Soil, Plant, Atmosphere System Model used in New Zealand) apply the Richards equation implicitly assuming soils to be homogeneous and isotropic. This is questionable for clayey soils and soils with certain pedological horizons as no soil is isotropic and homogeneous as is impliticitly assumed in these models (see next section); and:  (ii) As in traditional soil survey interpretations, a “representative”soil profile was defined for 6 soil series in the Italian study, for 72 soil units in the Dutch study and for 2 New Zealand soils. However, Droogers and Bouma (1997)  showed that soils that satisfy a given soil classification (the genoform) can have different functional properties as a function of past management. Each form of management can be represented by a so-called phenoform (see also Rossiter and Bouma, 2018 ). Whether or not the selected “representative” soil profiles adequately represent real field conditions is therefore unknown. Only field validation of modeling, increasingly by remote and proximal sensing techniques, can answer this question. Bonfante et al. (2019)  presented an exploratory analysis of three phenoforms of six Italian soil series, considering the possible effects of climate change up to the year 2100. They considered the effects of three forms of land degradation, resulting in phenoforms: formation of a plowpan, erosion of surface soil (without changing the soil classification) and surface compactionleading to increased surface runoff. In a follow-up study, Bonfante et al. (2020)  explored the effects of increased soil organic matter contents, often associated with different phenoforms, on calculated yields, again considering climate change scenarios. This simulated the possible effects of increasing the organic matter content of degraded soils depleted of organic matter. Distinctions of phenoforms will improve results when studying crop production, water dynamics, climate change, greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity preservation in future, including economic evaluations.     4 Pedological field research in future Traditional soil mapping programs have been completed in many so-called developed countries. This does, however, not imply that field work would not be necessary anymore. Field research on properties of phenoforms for a given genoform would be valuable. An example would be the study of organic matter in soils that could support modelling of Carbon dynamics in soil which is difficult. Field work to estabish relations between %C and current and past management was reported by Pulleman et al. (2000)  for a clay soil and by Sonneveld et al. (2002)  for a sand. They visited fifty farms and could develop a regression equation relating the actual % soil organic matter to past and current soil management. This is important because, in contrast to fertility studies where dose-effect relations can be studied in a single growing season, changes in organic matter content as a function of management can take decades or more. Field experiments on the effect of different Carbon management regimes would take too much time. But there are thousands of experiments in the field, waiting to be discovered! Organic matter contents cannot increase indefinitely. Every soil type has a characteristic equilibrium organic matter content where build-up of organic matter is in equilibriumn with breakdown as a function of environmental conditions. This content should be documented to guide future soil management and to provide useful threshold values. Note that the Pulleman et al (2000) and Sonneveld et al (2002)  studies were only possible because they used the occurrence of soil series on soil maps as a guiding principle when selecting sampling sites. Existing database data can be helpful when defining threshold values for organic matter and bulk density, as shown by Bouma and Wösten (2016)  discussing heavy clay soils in a Dutch database (not stratified by phenoforms) and noting that bulk densities varied within this soil class between 0.9 kg.m-3 and 1.3 kg.m-3 for topsoils while % organic matter varied between 3 and 11%. Returning to sampling sites, observing rooting patterns and questioning farmers can provide details on management practices that have resulted in these differences. Finally, Bonfante et al (2017) , showed that traditional empirical estimates of soil suitability were still quite useful in the Destre Sele area, identifying two soil series that were clearly unsuitable for growing agricultural crops. No simulation modeling was needed to draw that conclusion. Their study showed that these soils could be used to profitably grow an energy crop.  5 Mining soil databases or using soil types as class pedotransferfunctions. The cited Dutch, Italian and New Zealand case studies all used soil types as “carriers of information”or “class-pedotransferfunctions”. (Bouma, 1989; van Looy et al., 2017 ) but this is not common. The JRC (Joint Research Center) of the EU presents, for example, simulations for 500mx500m grids for Europe, based on sets of soil parameters for each grid. Also the SoilGrids programs of ISRIC emphasizes sets of parameters. Han et al. (2019 ) presented a global soil dataset for modeling purposes, where soils were characterized by three parameters: (i) texture; (ii) % organic C and (iii) rooting depth. Soil classification was not mentioned. Moebius-Clune et al (2016)  defined sets of physical, chemical and biological parameters for soil health, stratifying soils in three texture classes, not exploring the possibility to use soil types (possibly soil series in the USA) as class pedotransferfunctions which could be more informative, if feasible. This remains to be investigated. The large LUCAS database for Europe only reports data for topsoils (0–20 cm) and does not mention soil classification either, that would define subsoil data (Orgiazzi et al, 2018 ). Just presenting basic soil data for gridpoints has one important limitation: every gridpoint calculation remains an isolated occurrence and there is no possibility to accumulate experiences obtained in a particular soil type as more results become available. This can be changed easily by also considering the dominant soil type when characterizing soil in a given grid for modeling. All derived soil and management information is then contributed to an ever expanding “story”, associated with that particular soil type. Such a continuing enlargement of the “soil story”, as an extension of the traditional soil survey interpretation and land evaluation procedures, is attractive for joint learning involving stakeholders and for communication aimed at the policy arena and the public at large. Soil studies have been successful in dealing with a complaint in the past that soil data was poorly accessible as presented in soil survey reports, Many soil databases now provide access to soil data from all over the world, not only including legacy data from published soil surveys but new data as well (see introduction). But there is a risk when a limited number of basic soil parameters (such as texture, bulk density and organic matter contents) are directly translated into soil physical parameters used to simulate soil moisture regimes in soils by using pedotransferfunctions (PTFs) (Bouma, 1989; van Looy et al., 2017 ). Increasingly, hydraulic conductivity and moisture retention data for hydrological and climate models are estimated by PTFs, fed by soil databases. But such functions only apply when derived from measurements in a set of corresponding soils (van Looy et al., 2017 ). Also, as discussed elsewhere in more detail, in structured soils with macropores, such as planar voids and worm- and rootchannels, the common model for simulating water movement in soil based on the Richards equation does not apply because soils are not homogeneous and isotropic as theoretically required. Rapid bypass flow of water, moving down in the soil along macropores, is one example. Water repellancy is another. Also, occurrence of particular soil horizons, as distinguished in soil classification, can strongly affect soil water regimes and focusing attention to surface soils only is inadequate to assess soil moisture regimes. Application of pedological knowledge in Hydropedology is important to identify “non-ideal” flow conditions and suggest modified techiques that have been developed. In fact, soils in the field don’t show “ideal”behavior. (e.g. Booltink and Bouma, 2002; Lin et al, 2006; Bouma and Loveday, 1988; Bouma, 2016; Kersebaum, 2011; Tiktak et al., 2012; Larsbo et al., 2014 ). Rather than only list basic soil parameters in a gridpoint, the identification of the dominant soil type could be added, to be used as a “class pedotransferfunction”. In other words, the soil type at a given location is established and all previous data generated for that particular soil type are presented, including its possible “non-ideal” behavior and variability. More representative data can thus be obtained. A soil type, as defined by classification schemes, provides much more integrated and characteristic information than a limited set of seperate parameters. Names for soil types with local recognition, as reported above for Italy and New Zealand soil series, highly facilitates communication, as compared with abstract codes, as used, for example, in the Netherlands for the lowest classification level: the code cHN23 for a sandy soil is hardly inviting! Baker (1978)  used Wisconsin soil series to predict hydraulic properties of a given soil series by making measurements at different sites of hydraulic conductivity in the field. By presenting combined curves for each soil series he defined its variability. So rather than use seperate soil parameters to estimate hydrological parameters for modeling by pedotransferfunctions for each location or gridpoint, the soil series was identified and data already obtained for that series could then directly be applied, including its variability. Of course, it is essential that soil series can be accurately distinguished in the field. Bonfante and Bouma (2015)  included therefore flow-charts allowing unambiguous dictinction of the six soil series in the Destre Sele area in Italy.  6 True interaction with the stakeholders Soil, science, like other scientific disciplines, faces the problem that some of their generated knowledge is not applied in practice. That 30% of the land in the world is degraded one way or the other has been widely published (e.g. FAO and ITPS, 2015 ). But to be candid, we know quite well in most cases what to do about it after more than a hundred years of research but this knowledge is not applied everywhere. Effective communication with land users is therefore of crucial importance and here pedology has a rich history that is also well expressed by the concept of connectivity in soil security (Field et al., 2017 ). Decades ago, soil surveyers would walk over the land, talk with farmers and land users and their experiences formed the foundation of soil survey interpretations. But much of that information was lost and the development of DSS, as discussed above, is important to preserve such information. Sharing storylines about the way different ESs can be realized in practice in particular types of soils is again important and can now include information obtained by modeling. Pedologists are in a favorable position to assume a role as an intermediary between the soil research community, the farmers and the policy arena, as they have traditionally focused on soils in a landscape context which is important when defining ESs and land-related SDGs. The importance of storylines for communication can be put in a wider perspective: Homo Sapiens has been around for appr.300.000 years (consider this equivalent to 24 hours). Only 5000 years ago (11.25PM) man started to write and create images. Up to that time storytelling was the main means of communication. It still is in many parts of the world. Books appeared 500 years ago (11.58PM); internet 20 years ago (6 s before midnight). Storytelling is in our DNA. Let’s revive it!  Emphasis in discussions in the past was on agricultural production and this focus has now been broadened to more goals in line with the requirements for the land-related SDGs as expressed by ESs discussed above. In general there appears to be little interest of farmers in DSS and tools based on abstract information technologies. (Bampa et al, 2019 , Ingram, 2010) . They prefer acquisition of practice-oriented knowledge and life exchange of experiences with other farmers, preferably in discussion groups and focusing on operational aspects (e.g. O’Sullivan et al, 2018 ). This is also promoted by the European Innovative Partnership for Agriculture (EIP-AGRI) (EC, 2018 ). These developments should also be considered in a broader societal context. Stakeholders in the 21th century are critical and knowledgeable. Social media, only present during the last decade, feed “post-truth”, “alternative-fact” tendencies and the scientific community is increasingly challenged to show that the scientific method can significantly contribute to the common good (e.g. Bouma, 2015, 2018, 2019; Ingram et al., 2010  and others). Fukuyama (2018)  concluded that trust is essential for communication and that time-consuming engagement and joint learning with stakeholders is key. This does not imply that all opinions of stakeholders should be embraced as some of their politically motivated opinions may be wrong. But, above all, stakeholders are sensitive to be taken seriously and they prefer personal contact with advisors and scientists and serious debate, rather than face a clinical DSS and abstract rules and regulations. Farmers explicitly ask for locally relevant advice and credible information on improving more sustainable management measures (Bampa et al, 2019 ). So when the DSS shows that soils are too dry and recommend irrigation, the farmer will ask how much to apply, in what way and when and where. When fertility is inadequate and fertilization with nitrogen or phosfate is recommended, the farmer wants to know how much to apply, how, when and where. He wants to know when driving over the land does not result in compaction etc. All operational questions are based on the fact that weather conditions in each year will be different and the focus must necessarily be on highly variable adaptive management. Such questions can be answered by real-time modeling, realising that “average” weather conditions don’t exist. Fine-tuning management to these changing conditions on farmers fields by precision techniques has in a Dutch field study resulted in reduction of fertilizer leaching and in cost reductions of 25% A model is fed with real-time meteo data and moisture conditions and nutrient fluxes are simulated on a daily basis (Bouma et al, 1999; Van Alphen and Stoorvogel, 2000; Stoorvogel et al, 2015 ). Applications of fertilizer are fine-tuned to the needs of the plant which are determined by the growth stage of the plant and by weather conditions that govern leaching of fertilizers. Ideally, field measurements with proximal-sensing, remote-sensing and in-situ monitoring equipment are needed to verify modeling results and improve models. Such procedures can answer actual farmer’s operational management questions and can be seen as a logical follow-up of DSS systems as presented by Bampa et al. (2019 ). Soil classification and soil survey interpretations are of little direct value for field studies on precision agriculture. When researching precision agriculture, van Alphen and Stoorvogel (2000)  made model calculations for point observations on farmers fields, focusing on important functional properties for that particular location: (i) water stress in a dry year, (ii) N-stress in a dry year, (III) N-leaching in a wet year, and (iv) residual N-content at harvest in a wet year. Kriging was used to define patterns of relatively homogeneous areas considering these four properties, that could act as management units. These untits did not exactly correspond with pedologically defined areas of detailed soil maps. But information on precision techniques can be added to the information already available for the main soil type occuring at the field being characterized, enlarging the “ story” of that particular soil type.  7 Discussion Clearly, soil is back on the international research agenda. Rather than only produce valuable but empirical soil-centered recommendations for various forms of land use as presented in traditional soil survey interpretation and land evaluation schemes, the challenge is now to work with modelers in adjacent professions such as agronomy, hydrology, climatology and ecology contributing relevant soil data and be active partners in inter- and transdisciplinary projects that increasingly focus on achieving the land-related SDGs by defining relevant ESs. Of particular concern are the future effects of climate change on land use and agricultural production, where use of models is essential and where existing soil maps at regional and higher level are important to show spatial patterns. At this point in time enough food is available in the world, even though an estimated 30% of food produced is wasted. Famines are due to poor distribution, poverty, wars and corruption. But can we feed 10 billion people in 2050 in an environmentally acceptable way considering the dramatic effects of climate change? Should we not protect healthy soils, the way we protect nature? This question is, in the opinion of the author, most important for the soil science community for the years to come. The studies by Bonfante et al. (2015, 2019, 2020)  demonstrate that procedures are available to develop such future land-use scenarios. Being involved indirectly in SDG-oriented studies by letting outsiders extract and use different soil parameters from soil databases has a number of drawbacks, discussed above. Also, a feeling can prevail by outsiders that sets of seperate parameters in soil databases is all that soil science can offer and this would not contribute to good future job prospects for soil scientists and pedologists in particular. But there is more: automated routines of data gathering and application, be it in complex DSS or clinical computer programs, are likely to widen the gap between science (including soil science) and society. Truly engaging stakeholders right from the start, building trust by joint-learning and co-creation processes, is essential to counter the impersonal tendencies in our modern society. In fact, the SDGs will only be reached when this genuine form of engagement with stakeholders is established. Pedology has a rich history of interacting with farmers and land users while surveying their land, producing storylines for different soils. This ability is more than ever relevant as societies face the challenge of the SDGs in the years to come. Pedologists can play a role here. But above all, soil scientists should always be fascinated and humbled by the complexity of the subject of their study: Every soil type has a unique story to tell. A story about the most complicated biological system on our planet. We can’t understand her language, will never know the whole story and can only scratch the surface of the unknown using our limited tools and expertise. But that can still provide a highly valuable service to society.
