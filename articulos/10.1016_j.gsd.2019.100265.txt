Over the last 40 years, several research on arsenic epidemiology and public health carried out in Bangladesh to ratify its adverse effect on our health and social life. However, most of these researches focused on the extent of arsenic contamination in groundwater and related health consequences. Lack of comprehensive matrix lead us to compile all published arsenic research articles that had been undertaken in Bangladesh during Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) period (2000–2015) focused on the recommendation of arsenic mitigation and technologies, and future direction. Review matrix was developed in three different categories (1) Policy level (2) Facilities and technologies and (3) Health system, as these categories were the key areas to mitigate arsenic exposure. We noted mixed policy recommendations, and of those, incoordination among different stakeholders came up as one of the key barriers for arsenic mitigation in Bangladesh. Sharing low or arsenic-free tubewell, proper use and maintenance of arsenic filters, structural supply water such as the pipe water and pay-per-use concept were highlighted in several research.

Keywords Arsenic mitigation  Bangladesh  Safe water  Sustainable Development Goals    1 Introduction Arsenic is a naturally occurring element found readily in our soil, our water and in the food we eat. Naturally occurring arsenic in water has affected the lives of millions of people in Bangladesh which is often termed as “largest mass poisoning of a population in history ” (Smith et al., 2000 ). Despite some mitigation efforts, 52 million people in these regions are still drinking water containing arsenic above the commonly accepted limit of 10 ppb (with 20 million consuming concentrations of more than 50 ppb) (Cullen and Reimer, 2016 ; Chakraborti et al., 2018 ). Although, drinking arsenic contaminated water is considered as the main sources of arsenic intoxication to human health, there are other major sources which remain behind the curtain. Several studies confirmed the presence of arsenic in different varieties of rice contaminated via three successive routes (water-soil-crop) (Huq et al., 2006 ; Khan et al., 2009 ). Other study estimated that around 30% arsenic ingestion could occur though arsenic contaminated rice and other food sources (Duxbury et al., 2003 ; Correll et al., 2006 ). This indirect arsenic ingestion occurs firstly when crops are irrigated and then cooked with arsenic contaminated water (Meharg and Rahman, 2003 ; Williams et al., 2005 ). The impact of arsenic contamination either via directly drinking contaminated water or indirectly consuming arsenic contaminated foods is expected to be felt in generations to come. Arsenic affects multiple systems of the human body such as respiratory, vascular, nervous and endocrine system and causes numerous health hazards including increased risk of cancer, adverse pregnancy outcomes, reduce women's reproductive life, and impaired child development (Ahmad et al., 2001 ; Milton et al., 2005 ; Ahamed et al., 2006 ; Ahsan et al., 2006 ; Majumdar et al., 2014 ; Yunus et al., 2014 ; Rahman et al., 2015 ). According to WHO guidelines, water containing more than 10 μg/L of arsenic is deemed to be contaminated, whereas the benchmark for Bangladesh rises up to 50 μg/L due to some practical reasons (WHO, 1996 ; Caldwell et al., 2006 ; van Geen et al., 2006 ). About 20 million people in Bangladesh are now using tubewells contaminated with arsenic over the permissible level (>50 ppb) (UNICEF, 2008 ). Numerous alternative water supply technologies have been identified and tested in different areas of Bangladesh to reduce the concentration of arsenic in water. The Government of Bangladesh (GoB) started implementing mitigation programs in 1996 with support from the developmental partner as well as national and international NGOs. Improved wells, deep tube wells, pond-sand filters, rainwater harvesting, and piped water supply have all been piloted and adopted in Bangladesh as possible mitigation strategies (Ahamed et al., 2006 ; Howard et al., 2006 ; Milton et al., 2012 ). However, after three decades of the first identification of arsenic, 93% tubewells used for drinking purpose had no color to identify whether it is arsenic free or contaminated, and 71% of respondents didn't know whether tubewells used for drinking were tested for identifying arsenic contamination in the last one/two years (Pfaff et al., 2017 ). In addition to these, 5% of people who were disabled, need special support to fetch the water from nearby water point source. A review paper published in 2016 compiled all the research that had been taken place on arsenic contamination of underground water in Bangladesh. The review matrix showed that majority of the studies were commenced to find out the extent of arsenic contamination in underground water in Bangladesh and it's notorious health consequences to those who had been drinking arsenic contaminated water (Yunus et al., 2016 ). Nonetheless, a few research had been conducted to find the potential solution of this mass underground water poisoning in Bangladesh (Edmunds et al., 2015 ). We deem, it is time to think earnestly about the potential solution of this carcinomatous toxin that is naturally present in the groundwater and threaten human life with every drop of contaminated water. We, therefore, in this paper took an attempt to compile all the recommendation suggested in the arsenic epidemiology and public health research focused on mitigation, technologies and future direction that had been undertaken in Bangladesh during Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) period (2000–2015) (Table 1  ). Gathering comprehensive evidence in the MDGs period would shed-light on the future direction for. appropriate arsenic mitigation, safe water access and its research priorities for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) period in Bangladesh.  2 Extent and health effect of arsenic contamination in Bangladesh The presence of arsenic in drinking water in Bangladesh is extensive and widespread. In 1998 it was found that 41 out of 64 districts had arsenic concentrations in groundwater exceeding 50 μg/L (Mukherjee et al., 2006 ). Another study reported that 50 out of 64 districts had groundwater arsenic concentration exceeding 50 μg/L by 2005 (Ahamed et al., 2006 ). An estimated 57 million people in Bangladesh are at risk of arsenic induced disease due to chronic contamination of arsenic in their drinking water, which exceeds the WHO safe drinking limit (Ahmad, 2001 ). The dietary preference of Bangladeshi population, particularly the heavy intake of ground or root vegetables are found to be positively associated with arsenic toxicity manifested by Carotid-Intima Media Thickness (CMT). In addition to this, eating food crops such as rice which is irrigated by contaminated groundwater might lead to adverse health consequences including increased risk of death and disease (Khan et al., 2009 ; Adams, 2013 ). Arsenic toxicity affects millions of people in Bangladesh. In 1998 arsenic associated skin problems were first drawn to public attention (Chowdhury et al., 2000 ). Arsenic exposure results in melanosis (pigmentation) followed by keratosis and hyperkeratosis (NRC, 1999 ; Ahamed et al., 2006 ). Besides these, characteristic dermal lesions which includes conjunctival congestion, non-pitting foot swelling, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, ascites and Bowen's disease and gangrene are all associated with arsenic toxicity (Ahamed et al., 2006 ). Arsenic related skin lesions are also linked to early-onset menopause and reduced reproductive period (Yunus et al., 2014 ). High concentration of arsenic exposure could have both carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic effects (Mazumder et al., 2000 ; WHO, 2001 ; Rahman et al., 2007 ; Wasserman et al., 2007 ). Non-carcinogenic effect includes chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, liver diseases, neurotoxicity, chronic cough and diabetic mellitus. Carcinogenic effects include the high risk of developing cancer such as lung cancer and bladder cancer (Ferreccio and Sancha, 2006 ; Sun et al., 2006 ; Milton et al., 2012 ), which persists for decades after initial arsenic exposure (Ahsan et al., 2006 ). There is also an increased risk of lung cancer mortality among people with severe skin lesions caused by arsenic toxicity (Argos et al., 2014 ). A positive association was found between arsenic exposure via drinking water and adverse pregnancy outcomes such as spontaneous abortions (Ahmad et al., 2001 ; Milton et al., 2005 ; Ahamed et al., 2006 ), stillbirths (Ahmad et al., 2001 ; Milton et al., 2005 ; Ahamed et al., 2006 ), and pre-term births (Ahmad et al., 2001 ; Ahamed et al., 2006 ) and impair child development. Different studies conducted in arsenic affected areas in Bangladesh confirmed that child health particularly children's low birth weight (Ahmad et al., 2001 ; Milton et al., 2005 ; Ahamed et al., 2006 ), neonatal mortality (Ahmad et al., 2001 ; Milton et al., 2005 ; Ahamed et al., 2006 ), and infant mortality (Ahmad et al., 2001 ; Ahamed et al., 2006 ) are associated with arsenic exposure.  3 Arsenic mitigation at the policy level Mixed policy recommendations were noted with regards to the arsenic mitigation. Earlier in 2001, an article published in The Lancet suggested revising the Bangladesh national drinking water standards for arsenic to 0·05 μg/L after considering local Bangladeshi context, as it could improve health (Ahmad et al., 2001 ). It was not clearly explained why such recommendation was made because Bangladesh adopted WHO's earlier guideline in 1996 which was 50 μg/L or lesser (WHO, 1996 ), and WHO set global arsenic acceptance level in drinking water to 10 μg/L or less (WHO, 1998 ). The Government of Bangladesh (GoB) in its national policy for arsenic recommended to use alternative water sources such as community-based dugwells, pond sand filters, rainwater harvesting, deep tubewells, and piped water in the arsenic affected areas (GoB, 2014 ). It had been suggested that installation of home-based arsenic removal technologies could sustain GoB goal to mitigate arsenic (Shafiquzzaman et al., 2009 ; Sanchez et al., 2016 ). However, study reported that villagers shared less enthusiasm on using rainwater instead of tube well because of their deep-rooted mind-set on using the tube well water regardless its quality (Jakariya et al., 2007b ). At the policy level, researchers also highlighted that coordination among various actors and mass awareness campaign on the adverse effect of arsenic could lead to success (Jochem et al., 2016 ). Knowledge building by means of campaigns and surveys was initially used to raise awareness about arsenic contamination and its effects (Khan et al., 2015 ). It has been shown that perceived risk may decrease with increased knowledge (Arcury et al., 2002 ; Aziz et al., 2015 ). It is, therefore, important for the target population to understand the extent of the problem and agree to adopt alternative options to mitigate risk and demand safe water supplies. However, convenience is an important factor to consider in public health mitigation policies. Various studies have been completed to understand the mechanisms of mobilization and demobilization of arsenic and its mitigation in certain hydrogeological conditions (Johnston et al., 2014 ). Policies have been formulated to provide arsenic safe water to more than 22 million people exposed to arsenic above the national drinking water limit. However, more than 19 million people are still exposed to the same level as reported by the latest MICS survey (UNICEF, 2014 ). Other studies suggested that Bangladesh should experiment ‘paying for water’ concept to be implemented in the rural area, as it was assumed to be a potential solution and could create ownership among the users (Johnston et al., 2014 ; Khan et al., 2014 ; Khan and Yang, 2014 ; George et al., 2017 ). It was estimated that allocation of small fraction of Bangladesh's GDP on ensuring arsenic free water could eliminate arsenic by 2030 (Flanagan et al., 2012 ). Contrary, other study argued that dismantling the existing 8–10 million tubewells may not be economically variable case for Bangladesh (Jakariya et al., 2007b ). Other study supported that arsenic-safe tubewell water is the most accepted format among the users because of its low-cost maintenance, better water quality, and easy operation (Hossain et al., 2015 ).  4 Facilities and technologies for arsenic mitigation Mitigation efforts have stagnated over the past years resulting very slow progress in providing safe water to the most vulnerable communities. This stagnation has taken place at times when significant advances have been made towards arsenic mitigation in science and policy fronts. During the MDGs period (2000–2015), a majority of the study focused on developing facilities and/or technologies suggesting a various dimension of arsenic mitigation. Common suggestions were to find out effective arsenic treatment, and establishment of those treatment plant at the community level (Ahmad, 2001 ; Argos et al., 2012 ; Flanagan et al., 2012 ). Other suggestion includes installing deep tubewells, and reinstalling arsenic contaminated deep tubewells in 50–100 m depth instead of 20–30 m depth and monitor the ground quality over 5 years (Hoque et al., 2006 ; Howard et al., 2006 ; Jakariya et al., 2007b ; Robinson et al., 2011 ; Johnston et al., 2014 ). Earlier studies reported that local drillers could set tube well location based on the colour of the sedimentation where preference should be given to red coloured sediments and dark coloured sediments must be avoided (von Brömssen et al., 2008 ). It is because dark coloured sediment is a reliable indicator to detect high and low-As concentration in the groundwater (von Brömssen et al., 2007 ). Mobile-phone technology could be used for spatial determination to safer aquifer for installing new tubewells (van Geen et al., 2006 ). Well sharing, switch wells, structural supply water such as the pipe water and pay-per-use concept also came to attention as it was suggested in several studies (Hoque et al., 2004 ; Ahmed et al., 2006 ; Joya et al., 2006 ; Argos et al., 2012 ; Milton et al., 2012 ; Johnston et al., 2014 ). Simply remarking affected tubewells as ‘red’ and using sediment color tool for targeting arsenic safe aquifers could be another useful strategy, as it could help people to be aware of arsenic contaminated tubewells and its detrimental effect on health (Jakariya et al., 2007b ). Few other studies suggested to use arsenic filters such as Three-pitcher filters and Sono arsenic filter (SAF) and arsenic removal from water sources through reverse osmosis (Schmidt et al., 2016 ). However, it was pointed out that it may not lead to an effective arsenic mitigation without the pictorial guidebook for assembling the filter, proper use, and timely maintenance (Milton et al., 2007 ; Shafiquzzaman et al., 2009 ). Other researcher studied oral therapies such as vitamins and microminerals on those patients who have been suffering from chronic arsenic intoxication. The study reported that riboflavin; pyridoxine; vitamins A, C, and E; and folic acid could reduce the risk of arsenic skin lesions (Zablotska et al., 2008 ). Apart from arsenic free drinking water and its mitigation effort, several studies investigated rice as a potential source of arsenic contamination to human health. Studies suggested bioremediation (field injection of molasses), selection and breeding (including genetic modification) of low-arsenic rice cultivars, paddy field water management, and use of silicon fertilizer (Harvey et al., 2002 ; Zhao et al., 2010 ) to reduce arsenic absorption in rice. Another study added that balanced fertilizer has the potential to reduce arsenic accumulation in rice even though it is cultivated with arsenic contaminated irrigation water (Imamul Huq et al., 2011 ).  5 Compatible health system for arsenic mitigation A few researches were given importance on the role of the health system in arsenic mitigation strategies. Earlier in 2001, The Lancet article suggested that human resources development should be a part of comprehensive arsenic mitigation plan (Ahmad, 2001 ). Different test results between field tester and laboratory analyst are not infrequent and proper training of the field personnel along with cross-verification of the field test results with lab investigation could be ideal way to determine true arsenic concentration in the ground water (Jakariya et al., 2007a ). Other articles had emphasized on the awareness of the adverse health effect of drinking arsenic contaminated water and effective dissemination of the arsenic free technologies among affected population (Ahamed et al., 2006 ; Aziz et al., 2006 ; Shafiquzzaman et al., 2009 ). In addition, community education, capacity of local stakeholders and developing the water-arsenic (WA) testing capability among the affected population could be another way of reducing arsenic burden in Bangladesh (Rammelt and Boes, 2004 ; Aziz et al., 2006 ; George et al., 2012 ; Herath et al., 2016 ). Interestingly, one study published in 2006 highlighted a different dimension of arsenic mitigation. They stated women in affected areas should be actively involved in any arsenic mitigation program. They suggested to encourage the population to consume home grown fruits and vegetables (Ahamed et al., 2006 ).  6 Discussion Given the high burden of arsenic contamination in groundwater, several projects were implemented such as ‘Bangladesh Arsenic Mitigation Water Supply Project (BAMWSP)’ in 2002 where arsenic safe water was provided to ~2–2.5 million people covering 4,000 highly arsenic affected villages, 9272 deep tube wells, 300 rain water harvesting system, 393 dug wells and 1 pipe water supply system were installed as of 2006 (World Bank, 2007 ). Another major project was initiated by Bangladesh government titled ‘BD Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project’ in 2012 with the aim to increase safe water supply in the highly arsenic contaminated rural areas. Among the major five components of the project, the primary component included installation of rural pipe water in 383 unions of 20 districts (IEG Review Team, 2018 ; GoB, 2019 ). However, as of 2017 December, due to the slow pipe-water connection the number of beneficiaries shrunken from 71,506 to 14,000 households (IEG Review Team, 2018 ). Second component was installation of non—piped water supply through deep tube wells and dug well in areas where groundwater is highly contaminated with arsenic but have low population density. Due to the project restructuring in 2015, this second component was dropped. Other three components included capacity development, project management, and disaster contingency risk response among the Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) personnel and government officials (IEG Review Team, 2018 ). Although various government departments carried out multiple arsenic mitigation project, still there are pockets where emphasize should be given. Among the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set to be achieved by 2030, water was considered as one of the major areas for sustainable development and SDG 6 ‘To ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all’ was solely entitled for water and sanitation (Guppy et al., 2018 ). In SDG 6 sub-indicators, it was emphasized in all areas of water including universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water [SDG 6.1], ensuring water quality by reducing pollution [SDG 6.3], Water-use efficiently [SDG 6.4], integrated water resource management [SDG 6.5] and restoration of water ecosystem [SDG 6.6]. Furthermore, SDG 6 emphasized on the capacity-building to developing countries [SDG 6A] and support to strengthen the participation of local communities [SDG 6B] in water and sanitation management (UN, 2018 ). Although, SDG 6 focuses on water and sanitation, it is meticulously linked other SDGs such SDG 1 (poverty), SDG 2 (malnutrition), SDG (water-borne disease), SDG 4 (education), SGD 10 (income growth), SDG 11 (water-related disaster) and SDG 12 (natural resources) (UN-Water, 2016 ). It implies that numerous SDG goals will be under threat for not ensuring water for all. Our comprehensive review matrix pointed out the research recommendations and conclusions that were carried out during the MDG (2000–2015) period and shows the future directions for research and assist decision-making for the policy makers on mitigating arsenic. Although numerous research had been conducted in Bangladesh within the MDGs period (2000–2015), there seems to be lack of consensus among different stakeholders which resulted in ineffective arsenic mitigation program in Bangladesh. It is possible and is likely that further arsenic mitigation research has been conducted in Bangladesh beyond 2015 (end of the MDGs period); however, this review did not cover those research. This might lead to a failure to capture recent progress of the arsenic mitigation in Bangladesh. Understanding the magnitude of arsenic contamination burden, the 6th international congress titled ‘Arsenic Research and Global Sustainability’ was held in Stockholm, Sweden in 2016 to find out a holistic solution towards environmental arsenic contamination by solidification of consensus among the academicians, industries, research laboratories, government agencies and the private sector (Bhattacharya et al., 2016 ). Another limitation of this review is that it only counted on published research in Bangladesh; thus, there are chances of bias towards positive results (Dwan et al., 2008 ). This means that only those arsenic mitigation public health program and/or research that had been successful were published, which highlighted only one side of the story. However, arsenic mitigation public health programs in Bangladesh are multidimensional. Therefore, a different side to the story could be that arsenic mitigation public health programs were not evaluated properly using rigorous evaluation techniques. It is also possible that those programs were evaluated but professionals were not keen in publishing the effectiveness of the program which limits our knowledge on this issue. Despite this fact, a few researches published showed limited and/or no effect of their effort in reducing arsenic toxicity in human health. A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study (ClinicalTrials.gov  Identifier: NCT00392561) reported that either alone or in combination with Vitamin E (400 mg racemic [alpha]-tocopherol) and Selenium (200 μg l -selenomethionine) oral pills have no significant improvement of arsenic induced skin lesions after 6 months of intervention (Verret et al., 2005 ).  7 Conclusion There is a need for updating policies and strategies for arsenic mitigation in the light of recent scientific findings for safer sources of water and guides for targeting aquifers. Pragmatic policy based on scientific findings remains as the key element of successful arsenic mitigation in Bangladesh. Proper groundwater and surface water governance have to be initiated through a competent authority with support from all stakeholders in order to mitigate arsenic. It should also be linked with ensuring sustainable safe water supply for meeting increased demands in relation to population growth, urbanization, and industrialization.
