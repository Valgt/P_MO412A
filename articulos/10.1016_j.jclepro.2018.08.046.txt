                  Public participation is an important means of achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) in western countries, but it's just in its infancy in China. Does public participation in China help reduce air pollutant emissions and contribute to sustainable development? In order to answer this question, effects of the China Air Pollution Map Application on industrial pollution emissions, a natural experiment in which the public participates in environmental protection, are evaluated by using the difference-in-differences method. It is found that the launch of the Map restrains the industrial pollution discharge to a certain extent. However, its marginal effect fluctuates with the passage of time, indicating that it is not a stable means for maintaining sustainable development. Only when government policies, public and enterprise participation are jointly involved can air pollutant emissions be effectively controlled and SDGs be ultimately achieved.

School of Economics Renmin University of China Beijing 100872 China       Public participation is an important means of achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) in western countries, but it's just in its infancy in China. Does public participation in China help reduce air pollutant emissions and contribute to sustainable development? In order to answer this question, effects of the China Air Pollution Map Application on industrial pollution emissions, a natural experiment in which the public participates in environmental protection, are evaluated by using the difference-in-differences method. It is found that the launch of the Map restrains the industrial pollution discharge to a certain extent. However, its marginal effect fluctuates with the passage of time, indicating that it is not a stable means for maintaining sustainable development. Only when government policies, public and enterprise participation are jointly involved can air pollutant emissions be effectively controlled and SDGs be ultimately achieved.   Keywords Public participation  Sustainable development  Difference-in-differences (DID) method  Air pollution    1 Introduction In recent years, China's industrialization and urbanization have developed rapidly, and its gross domestic product (GDP) now ranks second in the world. However, these achievements are obtained at the cost of environmental pollution (Tao et al., 2012 ). According to the report issued by Asian Development Bank, 7 out of the 10 severest polluted cities in the world were in China and less than 1% of China's 500 cities met the air quality standards recommended by the World Health Organization. In the past few years, most of the eastern and central parts of China have been haunted by haze, which exerts adverse effects on human health. Faced with the increasingly severe environmental pollution, the Chinese Central Government and local governments at all levels have introduced many laws and regulations related to environmental protection. So far, the legal system of environmental and resource protection with Chinese characteristics has been basically established (Binrui, 2018 ). However, due to lax enforcement and other reasons, the environmental quality was not effectively improved (Allen et al., 2005; Lu and Tao, 2009; Xia et al., 2017 ). Environmental pollution has been one of the most critical barrier to achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) in China, which are spearheaded by the United Nations. Under this circumstance, how to reduce environmental pollution to contribute to sustainable development in China is still a hot topic at home and abroad (Tao et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2014 ). Historical experience of reducing heavy pollution to a mild and stable level by the United States and developed countries in Europe shows that public participation is an essential prerequisite for effective environmental governance (Peel, 2001 ). Due to historical and cultural differences, the democratization in China is slow and public participation in environmental protection is rare（Li, W.，et al., 2012 ）. In recent years, as the health and survival issues related to environmental pollution became increasingly prominent, the public has gradually become aware of environmental protection and many non-governmental environmental protection organizations have come into being, among which the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE) is a typical representative. IPE's experts believe that the biggest obstacle to solving China's environmental problems is the lack of effective tools for environmental governance, not the lack of technology or funds. In 2007, IPE released for the first time the China Air Pollution Map Application (hereinafter referred to as the Map), which is the first Chinese air pollution public welfare database (IPE, 2017 ). We can retrieve air pollution emissions and pollution sources information of the 31 provincial administrative regions and more than 300 municipal administrative areas in Chinese. The public can easily get the local air quality data recorded by illegal enterprises through the map, and at the same time report the excessive emission enterprise by mobile phone APP anytime and anywhere. This is a natural experiment in which the public participates in environmental protection. In the case that environmental regulation policies of Chinese government fail to work, can the Map released by the non-governmental organization effectively reduce industrial pollution emissions? How does public participation help to solve environmental pollution problems? Studying these problems is helpful to find out the causes of environmental governance dilemma in China, which has important practical significance for the effective control of China's environmental pollution. Given this, this study uses the difference-in-differences (DID) method to evaluate the impact of public participation on the intensity of industrial pollution emissions in China through a case study of a natural experiment of the Map. Compared with the existing literature, this paper contributes in the following two aspects: first, this paper is the first empirical study where the impact of China's public participation and on emissions of industrial pollution is assessed. Due to historical and cultural reasons, there are very few opportunities for the Chinese to participate in social governance. The air pollution map provides not only an excellent opportunity for the public to participate in environmental protection, but also a good natural experiment for understanding the impact of public participation on emissions in China. Therefore, this paper may provide a new perspective for the study of environmental governance in China; second, we can adopt the DID method to make a regression analysis in this paper. Compared with other methods, the DID method can separate the public participation from other factors affecting the pollution emission, which ensures more robust conclusions. This paper is organized as follows: the second part is a literature review; the third part introduces and evaluates the natural experiment of the release of the China Air Pollution Map; the fourth part shows the results of an empirical analysis and the test of the robustness of the results and the last part is devoted to the conclusions.  2 Literature review As the environment is a typical public undertaking, the utilization of the environment is non-competitive and non-exclusive. Without government intervention, enterprises will abuse the environment (Li, J.S. et al., 2016 ). The Chinese government must implement some proactive environmental policies to intervene in production activities of enterprises, thereby improving enterprises’ energy efficiency and reducing their pollutant emissions (Li, J.S. et al., 2017 ). With the deepening of public understanding of environmental issues, more and more environmental policy instruments have emerged. According to analyses by pertinent literature (Kemp and Pontogilo, 2011 ), environmental regulation policy instruments can be trichotomized: “command-control” policy, “economic incentive” policy and “public participation” policy, of which the “command-control” policy mainly introduces environmental standards, technical standards, bans on products, etc.; the “economic incentive” policy mainly introduces tradable discharge permits, environmental taxes, environmental subsidies, etc., and the “public participation” policy, also known as “mutual communication” policy, is intended to encourage the public, non-governmental organizations and enterprises to change their environmental behavior through publicity, education, cooperation and exchange and so on. It mainly consists of information disclosure, environmental supervision and voluntary environmental agreements. All kinds of environmental regulation instruments have different comparative advantages and different environmental effects. Different conclusions have been drawn on the environmental effects of the “command-control” and “economic incentive” policies. Some studies (Allen et al., 2005; Lu and Tao, 2009 ) believed that it is the inefficient enforcement of the Chinese written law that have directly led to the inefficiency of “command-control” policies. Other studies (Dummett, 2006 ) suggest that the “command-control” policy has a positive impact on environmental improvement. On the other hand, many researchers conclude that the “economic incentive” policies are better than the “command-control” policies in terms of environmental improvement. Jaffe et al. (2003)  found that: “economic incentive” type of policy provide a greater incentive to take a better emission reduction technology than the “command - control” type of environmental policy for enterprises. Harrison et al. (2015)  evaluate separately the effect of “command and control” policy and “economic incentive” policy to India enterprise behavior and environmental pollution based on double difference (DID) method. The authors found that, in terms of reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide, the “economic incentive” type is more effective than the “command - control” type in improving the quality of air environment. More and more studies have indicated that as environmental problems nowadays become increasingly serious, the traditional model of unilateral environmental governance by the government is far from being able to cope with environmental challenges faced by the mankind. With the development of mobile information technology and the advent of the age of big data, the third environmental policy, namely the “public participation” type, has gradually become an indispensable force in promoting the sustainable development of environment (Ross et al., 2016 ). Studies on public participation in environmental protection abroad were started earlier and were relatively mature. Early foreign researches were focused on proposing theories of public participation in environmental management, applying theories of public participation to the study and solution to environmental problems (Sample, 1993; Daniels, 1996; Adler, 2001 ). As the model of public participation in environmental management was supported and recognized by more and more countries around the world, many scholars employed empirical approach and case study to make deeper and concrete analyses of justice in participation process, decomposition of participation process and the design of evaluation indicators, etc. (Webler and Taler, 2000; Bond et al., 2004; Charnley and Engelbert, 2005; Doody et al., 2009; Carreira et al., 2016 ). A large number of empirical researches show that ineffective participation has increased decision-making costs, thus more and more researchers have been thinking about how to make public participation more effective. Macnaghten and Jacobs (1997)  examine the cultural factors governing the potential public uptake of sustainability and sought to cast light on public understanding of and identification with sustainable development. Depoe et al. (2004)  revealed in The Communication and Public Participation in Environmental Decision-Making  the extent to which public participation affected environmental policy-making and how to handle the influence and constraints of information exchange on policy makers. Kasemir et al. (2005)  examine methods for facilitating public participation on local and international levels and suggest consultation procedures integrating technical scientific modelling with democratic decision-making processes. Konisky and Beierle (2015)  describes a set of “innovative” participatory processes study circles, citizens juries, round tables, and collaborative watershed management efforts and considers their relative strengths and weaknesses through the use of a common comparative framework. Chinese researches start later than foreign ones and are not profound enough. Although there have been many studies on public participation in environmental management in recent years (Li et al., 2012; Chi et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2015 ), most of them are shallow description and evaluation of participation. Theoretical researches on public participation in environmental protection are seldom focused on the in-depth analysis of its formation conditions, mechanism of action and mode of participation. Besides, there are even no quantitative researches in the field. Maybe the main reason for this phenomenon is the lack of public participation in China.  3 A natural experiment: release of the China air pollution map application Due to historical and cultural reasons, China's democratization is far behind those of western developed countries and China's public participation in social governance is also in its infancy. In recent years, with the development of economy and the improvement of people's living standards, people cannot endure environmental pollution anymore and their awareness of participation in environmental protection has been gradually sharpened. The past few years have frequently witnessed public participation in environmental protection, such as the Zijin Mining incident, the Wuxi water crisis event and the ban on free plastic bags. These events helped to solve environmental problems effectively. But their scale was small. China's largest public participation in environmental activities to date was the launch of the China Air Pollution Map Application in December 2007 by the non-profit organization of IPE. This environment-monitoring software received free cloud computing resources from AliCloud. This application first ranks “excessive emissions enterprise” as the “legend of the map” to replace the administrative geography into specific geographical places on the map, and specifically points out who and where discharge what pollutants. It allows the public to quickly and easily query the air quality and pollutant concentrations of each city and to report excessive pollution of large enterprises through microblog, WeChat and other social platforms. In just a few days after the application went alive, many users disclosed in public social platforms polluting sources whose pollution emissions near their homes exceed limits. Netizens spontaneously call the enterprises with high concentrations of emissions to make public statements about their environmental behavior. In order to understand the impact of air pollution map on the waste gas emission of industrial directly, we first analyze the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of regulatory records. Fig. 1   shows spatial distribution of total regulatory records of excessive emissions of enterprises in China during 2008–2015. It can be seen from the figure that, during 2008–2015, the provinces that have largest number regulated enterprise mainly distributed in the east of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Yangtze River delta, Pearl River delta, the west is significantly lower than the east and central parts, and the middle is between the two. So we can say the degree of air pollution is positively correlated with the level of industrial development in China. Fig. 2   shows temporal distribution of the regulatory record of excessive discharge enterprises which air pollution map database contains during the 2008–2015 years. From the calendar year included in the company's regulatory record, the exhaust emissions of corporate regulatory information tend to be on the rise. It can be seen from the figure that, during 2008–2015, the number of regulated enterprise is between 4000 and 6000, there is a big surge after 2013, especially in 2015, and the number has reached 12315. The air pollution map, which has emerged in response to big data and mobile Internet development, may restrain the environmental behavior of these enterprises with excess emissions. Firstly, the pollution information collection, dissemination, analysis and evaluation from IPE can turn into a pressure of public opinion on polluting enterprises, forcing them to take corrective actions to restore the reputation. Secondly, the environmental protection awareness of the public suffering from the haze is gradually raised, and they start to pay close attention to the air quality of their cities and surroundings. They report the enterprises with excessive emission to the map and spread them by public social media platform, such as micro-blog and WeChat, which becomes the second channel to exert the pressure of public opinion on polluting enterprises. At the same time, for environmentalists, they can force manufacturers and suppliers of related products to proactively take environmental protection measures to improve the benefits of enterprises by making a green purchasing choice of their own (Grimmer and Bingham, 2013; Agyeman, 2014 ). Third, as the whole society would pay close attention to information disclosure from air pollution map, the local government would respond quickly in order to cover up their poor environmental enforcement by forcing enterprises to make corrective action for pollution reduction. Practice shows that public participation does give a new impetus to the control of pollutant emissions. In particular, after the “Blue Map”, the version 2.0 of the Map, was released on March 26, 2015, the cumulative downloads exceeded 3 million in just half a month. The “micro-report” submitted by a great number of users promoted active interaction between the public and the government departments of environmental protection in Shandong, Zhejiang and other provinces. The official microblog of Shandong Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau showed support for environmental protection activities of non-governmental organizations and the supervision from all walks of life, and said that the Bureau would severely punish polluting enterprises with excessive emissions reported by the public. Thus, a new haze governance pattern featured by the public's enthusiastic report, the government's active verification and substantial rectification by enterprises, was formed. In short, the release of the air pollution map has forced many companies marked by the map to proactively take rectification actions and upgrade their environmental protection facilities to eliminate their pollution records from the database, which on the one hand will maintain their reputation, and on the other, reduce pollution emissions. Fig. 3   describes the change trend of the emission intensity of industrial waste gas in China during the period 2002–2015. The results indicate that the emission intensity of industrial waste gas shows an integral downward trend in 2002–2015, and fluctuated in individual years. In the last five years, the downward trend in industrial emissions was even more pronounced2  1 QH(Qinghai), JS(Jiangsu), GZ(Guizhou), BJ(Beijing), GX(Guangxi), GD(Guangdong), YN(Yunnan), HI(Hainan), GS(Gansu), LN(Liaoning), JX(Jiangxi), SH(Shanghai), NX(Ningxia), HN(Hunan), HE(Hebei), SD(Shandong), XZ(Xizang), JL(Jilin), HLJ(Heilongjiang), FJ(Fujian), TJ(Tianjin), NM(Neimenggu), AH(Anhui), SN(Shanxi), XJ(Xinjiang), SC(Sichuan), CQ(Chongqing), HB(Hubei), HA(Henan), ZJ(Zhejiang).  2 The emission intensity of exhaust gas is expressed by the amount of waste emission produced by the unit industrial added value (unit: billion cubic meter/billion), the industrial added value data from calendar year "China Industrial Statistics Yearbook", industrial emissions data from calendar year "China Environmental Statistics Yearbook".  . But the problem is that even if we do observe that Industrial emissions intensity has declined after the release of the air pollution map, it is difficult to simply attribute the results to the release of the pollution map. The reason is that the emission intensity is usually the result of a number of factors, including industrial production capacity, environmental policy, and so on. Therefore, it is difficult to accurately assess the actual effect of the public participation in environmental protection. In order to overcome this problem, the author adopts the difference-in-differences (DID) method to accurately identify the actual effect of public participation in the process of environmental protection in China by the difference of the changes in emission intensity between air pollution intensive industries and non-air pollution intensive industries in the pollution map of the line before and after.  4 Empirical results 4.1 DID model In order to carry out the natural experiment, the random sample grouping should be carried out first. The sample that is affected by the policy is the treatment group, otherwise it is the control group. The group virtual variable of the sample is recorded as du . du  = 1, which indicates that the sample is affected by the policy. du  = 0 shows that there is no policy impact. The time virtual variable of all the samples is recorded as dt . Before the experiment, dt  = 0, after the experiment, dt  = 1, which show that the policy impact had occurred. The product of the time virtual variables and the group virtual variables is Difference in Difference Estimator. Its estimation coefficient is the discriminant basis of whether the effect of policy implementation on the explanatory variables is significant, that is, the so-called policy effect. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of public participation on environmental pollution in China, and the way to do that is to take the release of the China Air Pollution Map as a natural experiment of public participation in environmental protection, and use the DID method to examine the impact of public participation on pollution emission of Chinese enterprises. To this end, a treatment group and a control group are first set up, with air pollution-intensive industries as the treatment group and other industries (non-air pollution-intensive industries) as the control group. Second, the sample interval is divided into the periods of 2002–2007 and 2008–2015 with the year of 2007 when the Map was first launched as the dividing line. Finally, two dummy variables du  and dt  are set, with du  assigned the value of 1 in the treatment group and 0 in the control group; with dt  assigned the value of 0 before 2007 and 1 after 2007. The benchmark estimating equation is set as follows:(1) p i t   = β 0  + β 1  d u i t   + β 2  d t i t   + β 3  d u i t   ∗ d t i t   + ε i t       wherein, i  and t  represent the t th year of the i th industry; the explained variable p  an indicator of the intensity of industrial pollution emission, β 1     the invariable difference of the pollution emission intensity of industries in the treatment group against that of industries in the control group, β 2     the impact of other invariable factors other than public participation on the intensity of pollution emission of industries in the treatment group before and after the Map was launched, the impact of the launch of air pollution Map on the intensity of pollution emission of industries. The validity of the results of analysis by the DID method may be affected by the absence of variables. According to the research conclusions of the existing literature (Lanoie et al., 2008; Becker, 2011 ), industrial added value, R&D, FDI and environmental regulation（ER）are important influence factors of industrial pollution emission. In order to ensure the effectiveness of the DID results, the author adds the above control variables to equation: y, the industrial added value; R&D, measured by the proportion of the number of scientific and technological personnel in total in each industry; FDI, an indicator of the scale of foreign direct investment in an industry, measured by the proportion of total assets of foreign-funded enterprises in the total assets of each industry in this paper; ER, measured by the proportion of pollution control investment in total cost in each industry. The above data are from China Statistical Yearbook and China Industrial Statistics Yearbook. The basic estimating equation is set as follows:(2) p i t   = β 0  + β 1  d u i t   + β 2  d t i t   + β 3  d u i t   ∗ d t i t   + β 4   ln  y i t   + β 5  R & D i t   + β 6  F D I i t   + β 7  E R i t   + ε i t         4.2 Benchmark estimation results As the launch of the Map is intended to constrain the waste gas emission of enterprises, its impacts on air pollution-intensive industries and on non-air pollution-intensive industries are quite different. Therefore, this paper defines industries with waste gas emissions per unit output value exceeding the average waste gas emissions per unit output value of all industries in 2002–2015 as air pollution-intensive ones and as the treatment group; whereas those whose waste gas emissions per unit output value are less than the average waste gas emissions per unit output value of all industries in 2002–2015 as non-air pollution-intensive ones and as the control group3  3 The average waste gas emission density from industries is 3.327 billion cubic meter/billion during 2002–2015, industries above the average are:Production and supply of electric power and heat power, Smelting and pressing of ferrous metals, Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products, Mining and processing of non-ferrous metal ores, Mining and processing of ferrous metal ores, Extraction of petroleum and natural gas, Production and supply of gas, Processing of petroleum, coking, processing of nuclear fuel, Manufacture of raw chemical materials and chemical products, Manufacture of medicines, Manufacture of chemical fibers. The above 11 sectors constitute the processing group, and other industries are the control group, we calculate and sort out according to related data from the "China Statistical Yearbook", "China Industrial Statistical Yearbook" and "China Statistical Yearbook of the environment”.  . After determining the treatment group, we use waste gas emissions intensity p  as explanatory variables, and adopt OLS to estimate the regression equation. Column① show that when the regression equation includes no control variables, the regression coefficient of the core variable dudt  is negative and significant at the level of 10%. When such control variables as ln y、R&D、FDI and ER are included in the regression equation, the regression coefficient of dudt  is still negative and significant at the level of 5% (column②). But Woodridge & Breusch-Pagan test results show that the regression equation has significant first-order autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity, this means that the OLS estimation results of the regression equation may not be valid. Therefore, the Panel Correction Standard Deviation Estimation (PCSE) is used to correct the first order autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity of the regression equation. Column③ show that when the regression equation includes no control variables, the regression coefficient of the core variable dudt  is negative and significant at the level of 5%. When such control variables are included, the regression coefficient of dudt  is still negative and significant at the level of 10% (column④). The results indicate the public participation in environmental protection represented by the release of the Map reduced the industrial pollution emissions, and improved the environmental quality to a certain extent. The above results also mean that the viewpoint that China's public participation in environmental protection is very small is questionable. Despite the lack of public participation in most areas of China, there has been a great improvement in environmental protection in recent years. The main reason is that the development of the Mobile Internet makes the public have a channel to participate in environmental protection.  4.3 Marginal effect The above empirical results only reveal the average impact of public participation on pollution emissions of air pollution-intensive industries after the Map was launched on line. In order to gain a clearer understanding of how marginal effect of the launch of the Map on industrial pollution emissions changes over time, the author extends the regression equation as follows:(3) p i t   = β 0  + β 1  d u i t   + β 2  d t i t   + β 3  d u i t   ∗ d t i t   + β 4   ln  y i t   + β 5  R & D i t   + β 6  F D I i t   + β 7  E R i t   + ∑ j = 2008  2015   α j  d u i t   ∗ d t i t   ∗ y e a r j   + ε i t       wherein y e a r j     is the annual dummy variable, the year j  is 1 and other years are 0. It can be easily seen that the marginal effect of the release of the Map in the year j  on the intensity of pollution emissions of air pollution-intensive industries is. Estimate the above regression equation are shown in Table 2   . The marginal effect calculated from the regression results indicates that the release of the Map has reduced the intensity of industrial air pollution emissions by 8.3 percentage points in the first year and by 3.5, 3.7, 2.6, 2.7, 2.0, 5.5, 8.4 percentage points respectively in the following years. From the regression results, it can be seen that although the release of the Map decreased the intensity of industries pollution emissions to a certain extent, its marginal effect shows a certain degree of volatility with time passing by. To be specific, the marginal effect increased significantly in the first year, fluctuated in the subsequent years and has risen again in recent years. One reason for this phenomenon may be that most Chinese enterprises lack social responsibility, especially the awareness of environmental protection nowadays. Besides, the Map makers are from a non-governmental environmental organization and participants in environmental protection are ordinary people. Neither of them could form a strong binding force, which may be another reason. Under the great pressure from public opinions, enterprises were forced to cut down on pollution emissions. However, once the focus of public opinion shifts, they will discharge pollutants beyond standards again in order to save production costs. In recent years, thanks to the rapid development of mobile internet, the size of public participation in environmental protection has increasingly grown, coupled with the “Eastern haze”, “cancer village” and other environmental problems which have become increasingly prominent, the Chinese government and people attach great importance to environmental protection. Therefore, the supervision over enterprise pollution emission by air pollution map is gaining more and more influence, which may be the reason that the marginal effect of the regression results rose again.  4.4 Robustness check A prerequisite to the DID method is that if there is no release of the China Air Pollution Map Application, systematic differences in the intensity of pollution emissions of industries from both the treatment group and the control group will not be found over time. In order to prove whether the above assumption is correct, the author carries out a test using the counter-factual method. Specifically, since the release of the Map only serves as a constraint on and incentive for enterprises to reduce waste gas emissions and control waste gas pollution and has no impact on the reduction of enterprises’ waste water and solid waste emissions, we can test the robustness of DID method results by examining the impact of the release of the Map on the intensity of pollution emissions from waste water-intensive sectors (WWIS) and solid waste intensive sectors (SWIS) respectively. If the release of the Map has no significant impact on the intensity of pollution emissions from WWIS and SWIS, then it can be concluded that if there is no release of the Map, systematic differences in the intensity of air pollution emission of industries in both the treatment group and the control group may not be found over time, thus the results of analysis by the DID method are robust. First, the author defines sectors with waste water emissions per unit output value exceeding the average waste water emissions per unit output value of all industrial sectors as WWIS and as the treatment group, while other sectors as the control group4  4 The average waste water emission density from industries is 3.573 million tons/billion during 2002–2015, industries above the average are: Manufacture of paper and paper products, Manufacture of textile, Manufacture of leather, fur, feather and related products, Manufacture of medicines, Manufacture of chemical fibers, Processing of food from agricultural products, Manufacture of foods, Manufacture of beverages, Production and supply of electric power and heat power, Manufacture of raw chemical materials and chemical products.  . We set the regression equation mode according to Eq. (2) , column① show that when the regression equation includes no control variables, the regression coefficient of the core variable dudt  is positive and significant at the level of 10%. When the regression equation includes control variables, the estimation results (column②) shows that the regression coefficient of dudt  is not significant. Secondly, the author defines sectors with solid waste emissions per unit output value exceeding the average solid waste emissions per unit output value of all industrial sectors as SWIS and as the treatment group, while other sectors as the control group, and use the same method to test the regression equation5  5 The average solid waste emission density from industries is 1.28 million tons/billion during 2002–2015, industries above the average are: Production and supply of electric power and heat power, Mining and washing of coal, Mining and processing of ferrous metal ores, Mining and processing of non-ferrous metal ores, Mining and processing of nonmetal ores, Smelting and pressing of ferrous metals, Smelting and pressing of non-ferrous metals.  . The estimation results (Table 3  , column③ and column④) show that the regression coefficient of dudt  is not significant. It indicates that without the release of the Map, there would be no systematic differences among the intensity of pollution emissions from Chinese industries over time. Therefore, the estimated results by the DID method are robust.   5 Conclusions It can be predicted that with the advent of the era of the rapid development of mobile Internet and big data, the Chinese public in participating in environmental protection are facing unprecedented opportunities with more and wider scope, various forms, and significant impact. In the near future, public participation will be an important means of environmental protection, which will affect achieving sustainable development goals in China. However, up to now, the research on the public participation in environmental protection in China is basically a blank, which is a great loss for the sustainable development of China and the world. Chinese enterprises often ignore the impact of their pollution emissions on the environment due to the imperfect legal system and loose enforcement. Active public participation is essential for China to eliminate this phenomenon, but how have public participation affect China's environmental protection? Facing the increasingly serious environmental crisis, how will we improve it to achieve sustainable development goals? This paper takes the release of the China Air Pollution Map Application, a natural experiment of public participation in the environmental protection as a case for the first time, and adopts the DID method to assess the impact of public participation on the intensity of industrial pollution emissions. It is found that the release of the Map reduces the industries pollution intensity to a certain extent, and that its marginal effect increases with time passing by, yet with a certain degree of fluctuation. This result shows that in the era of news and information explosion, participation of multiple parties in environmental protection will turn into a necessary social will which urges enterprises to improve their environmental performance. In a word, China's sustainable development is a reflection and negation of the traditional development strategy. The government is the leading force in the implementation of sustainable development, while the public is the basic force, and without extensive public participation, the realization of the goal of sustainable development is difficult. Only when the concept of sustainable development has been generally recognized and accepted, and thus into the public values, so the public can consciously participate in sustainable development, Chinese sustainable development objectives will be achieved. Due to cultural and historical reasons, the Chinese public participation in social governance is in its embryonic stage. Although it helps reduce the intensity of industrial pollution emission to a certain extent, its constraints on enterprises' pollution emissions are not strong enough as most Chinese enterprises lack social responsibility, especially awareness of environmental protection. In order to improve public participation in environmental protection efficiency and reduce environmental pollution emissions to achieve sustainable development goals, we propose the following policy recommendations from the government's point of view:(1) The legal level. First of all, the government should reform or formulate relevant laws, regulations and policies to ensure that non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and non-corporate social organizations (NPOs) participate in environmental decision-making accordance with the law. Secondly, to promote the implementation and improvement of the system of environmental information disclosure, and to promote the legislation of information publicity so as to make the data obtained by pollution maps real and effective.  (2) Management level. First of all, a sound response mechanism for environmental events must be established. For the polluting enterprises reported from NGO organizations, the media and the masses, the government should quickly establish a unified information platform, timely release of government opinions, and ultimately the result of events, to achieve open and transparent information. Second, it is proposed to integrate environmental information and data scattered across various agencies and departments to establish national environmental information and data systems.  (3) Ability upgrading level. The new media has become an important channel for public to gain environmental information, express their willingness to participate in environmental decision-making, environmental management and law enforcement supervision, so the government managers must understand and accept the new media, use information dissemination way which apply to the new media context, construct open media system help to deal with the challenges of green development, consolidate and improve all levels of government environmental information management capabilities, to deal with the mobile Internet development and the era of big data about environment.    Therefore, faced with serious environmental pollution and environmental degradation, government should take active steps together with non-governmental organizations of environmental protection to exert pressure on polluting enterprises, and to promptly deal with industrial excessive emission. Only in this way can China win the environmental protection battle and achieve sustainable development goals.
