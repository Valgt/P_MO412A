                  Microorganisms, including bacteria, archaea, viruses, fungi, and protists, are essential to life on Earth and the functioning of the biosphere. Here, we discuss the key roles of microorganisms in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), highlighting recent and emerging advances in microbial research and technology that can facilitate our transition toward a sustainable future. Given the central role of microorganisms in the biochemical processing of elements, synthesizing new materials, supporting human health, and facilitating life in managed and natural landscapes, microbial research and technologies are directly or indirectly relevant for achieving each of the SDGs. More importantly, the ubiquitous and global role of microbes means that they present new opportunities for synergistically accelerating progress toward multiple sustainability goals. By effectively managing microbial health, we can achieve solutions that address multiple sustainability targets ranging from climate and human health to food and energy production. Emerging international policy frameworks should reflect the vital importance of microorganisms in achieving a sustainable future.

overwhelming majority of phylogenetic diversity in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic realms. (B) Microbes account for ∼46 Gt C of living biomass, the largest proportion after plants. Data are from Hug et al.4   for (A) and Bar-On et al.5   for (B), with bacteria and archaea estimates for (B) updated based on Bar-On and Milo.6   These data do not include the substantial viral diversity and biomass on Earth, which remain insufficiently quantified to include.7      Figure 2 Seven key pathways that microbial research and technology can be used to reach the SDGs Links show which SDGs (right) are most likely to be positively influenced by targeting each category (left), with the most direct links highlighted in bold. The dendrogram clusters the SDGs based on Euclidean dissimilarity of the connecting links, showing which SDGs are likely to be influenced by microbes in similar ways. Goal 17 (partnerships for the goals) is not included because this is an overarching SDG relevant to all goals but not specifically influenced by microbial research and technology. Goal 17 is discussed in section “partnerships for the goals .”    Figure 3 Components of a microbe-powered circular bioeconomy Left: examples of abundant renewable raw materials (non-food organic residues, CO2 , and other gaseous wastes) to feed a microbially powered circular bioeconomy. Right: examples of potential products generated from these raw materials in a microbe-powered biorefinery (fuels, power, materials, chemicals, and biochar).    Figure 4 Microbial richness hotspots (the most diverse areas across the globe) are poorly protected Microbial richness data from Guerra et al.163   was extrapolated to the global scale using Random Forest machine learning following van den Hoogen et al.,165   and area with richness values in the top 95th  percentile (“hotspots”) was overlaid with polygons from the World Database on Protected Areas.166   Only 13.4% of the global hotspot areas of microbial richness fall within strict conservation areas. A further 22.8% are located in less strictly protected areas.    Figure 5 Microbe-relevant positive interactions between the SDGs Using microbes to directly advance each SDG will likely indirectly advance other SDGs (outgoing arrows). For example, microbial biotechnology used to reduce hunger (Goal 2) will also indirectly reduce poverty and inequality (Goals 1, 5, and 10), improve health (Goal 3), educational experience (Goal 4), community and commercial sustainability (Goals 11 and 12), and peace (Goal 16). Detailed descriptions of all arrows are provided in Table S1 . Although Goal 17 cannot be directly advanced by microbial technology, outgoing links are shown to all other SDGs because including microbes in international and organizational policy agreements will likely benefit all goals (see section “partnerships for the goals ”).

Corresponding author  ∗∗∗ Corresponding author   Microorganisms, including bacteria, archaea, viruses, fungi, and protists, are essential to life on Earth and the functioning of the biosphere. Here, we discuss the key roles of microorganisms in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), highlighting recent and emerging advances in microbial research and technology that can facilitate our transition toward a sustainable future. Given the central role of microorganisms in the biochemical processing of elements, synthesizing new materials, supporting human health, and facilitating life in managed and natural landscapes, microbial research and technologies are directly or indirectly relevant for achieving each of the SDGs. More importantly, the ubiquitous and global role of microbes means that they present new opportunities for synergistically accelerating progress toward multiple sustainability goals. By effectively managing microbial health, we can achieve solutions that address multiple sustainability targets ranging from climate and human health to food and energy production. Emerging international policy frameworks should reflect the vital importance of microorganisms in achieving a sustainable future.   Microbes are essential to life on Earth and will be core, with the advent of exciting new technologies, to our ability to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for a sustainable future.   Keywords archaea  bacteria  microeukaryotes  microbial biotechnology  microorganisms  planetary health  sustainability  Sustainable Development Goals  viruses    Introduction The emergence of microorganisms more than three billion years ago1   has fundamentally shaped the planet, enabling the existence of all other life forms. Today, microorganisms are the most diverse organisms on Earth2  , 3   (Figure 1  ), estimated to represent over 99% of all species.3   They inhabit almost every environment, from deep ocean trenches to human guts. The unique catalytic capacity of microorganisms means that they are central to the cycling of most of the major elements (including H, C, N, P, O, and S) essential to life on Earth.8   Just as the human microbiome is critical to the functioning of individuals, the global microbiome is central to the functioning of the planetary system. In 2012, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)9   were proposed to provide an overarching framework to move toward a sustainable future on our planet. Yet, although microbial activity is fundamental to sustaining all life, the role of microorganisms is not explicitly represented in the high-level policy documentation aimed at achieving these goals. Across the 560 official multilateral treaties of the UN Secretary-General,10   explicit mentions of microorganisms or associated solutions are largely absent. Unlike other forms of life, including plants and animals, the lack of microbial representation may stem from their ubiquitous and inconspicuous nature. However, an ever-expanding field of research shows how different microbial groups perform different functions, and the effective management of microbial communities can provide solutions for improving various aspects of life, from human health11   to energy12   or food production.13   In addition, promoting microbial health can help address global threats like climate change,14  , 15   biodiversity loss,16   pathogen emergence,17   pandemic outbreaks,18   food insecurity,13   and increasing societal inequalities.19   And yet, until now, few financial or regulatory policies recognize the need to incentivize the deployment of microbial solutions or the targeted microbial research that is needed to address our international sustainability targets. Over the last decade, several studies have highlighted the need to consider microorganisms and associated technologies for achieving different SDGs (see Timmis et al.20   and articles therein; Akinsemolu21  ). Here, we build on these perspectives to provide an overview of the potential for integrating microbial technologies into all of these sustainable agendas. Recognizing that microorganisms are directly or indirectly associated with every one of SDGs, we review the key overarching areas where emerging microbial technologies have begun to provide tangible solutions that can contribute to achieving a sustainable future (Figure 2  ). In addition, by clustering these microbial processes into seven overarching areas, we identify tangible synergies that reveal where microbial innovation can help in accelerating multiple “Global Goals” in tandem. By reviewing and highlighting the fundamental role of microorganisms in achieving the SDGs, we hope to encourage the explicit consideration of microorganisms in international sustainability planning and policy agreements.  Nurturing health and addressing disease SDGs: 1 , 2, 3 , 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16 Good human health is a necessary precondition for many societal functions, including education (Goal 4), employment and economic prosperity (Goal 8), community well-being and peace (see Anand et al.19  ) (Goals 11 and 16), and equality (Goals 5 and 10). Health is prejudiced by many factors, including poverty (Goal 1), malnutrition (Goal 2), environmental pollution (Goals 6 and 12), limited access to clean water and healthcare (Goals 3 and 6), and conflicts, especially those leading to the displacement of peoples and the rise in refugee camps (Goal 16). As acknowledged by the One Health concept,22   health is also directly linked to environmental reservoirs of pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes and implicitly dependent on a diverse range of flora and fauna, natural and managed environments, and the food and other products derived from them.23  , 24   Yet, despite the highly integrated nature of health within the SDGs, there exists a broad range of microbial technologies that can specifically target many of the greatest direct threats to human health. Microbial technologies provide barriers to risks posed by infectious and toxic agents in the environment. They include, for example, wastewater treatment and processes for purification of drinking water (e.g., facilitated by membrane biofilm reactors), which can remove harmful biological and chemical agents.25  , 26   Wastewater treatment also now affords near real-time surveillance of pathogens in community wastewater,27   inactivation of emerging pollutants (e.g., phthalates28  ) and antimicrobial resistant pathogens,29   recovery and recycling of resources like nitrogen and phosphorus, and conversion of waste carbon into methane as an energy source30   (Goals 6 and 7). Deployment of these technologies in communities lacking clean water is key in reducing inequalities (Goals 5 and 10). Moreover, vector control, such as the insertion of microorganisms into arthropod vectors (e.g., mosquitoes) to prevent reproductive cycles,31  , 32   can reduce the risk of pathogen transmission (Goal 3). As well as being used for risk prevention, microbial technologies are central in addressing countless health challenges. They are the basis of vaccines and many pharmaceuticals that reduce the incidence, severity, and mortality of infectious and secondary non-infectious diseases, such as cancers (Goals 3, 5, and 10). Bacteria are being developed to image tumors33   and, along with bacterial minicells34   and bacterial membrane vesicles,35   are being designed to deliver toxins and other compounds to tumors.33   While antibiotics have saved countless lives, their inappropriate use in healthcare and animal husbandry has selected and promoted the spread of multi-drug-resistant organisms, which has become a pressing contemporary global health crisis.36   Of particular concern are the multi-resistant ESKAPE pathogens (see De Oliveira et al.37  ), especially in hospital settings. Pathogenic biofilms are also particularly challenging as slow-growing or dormant microbes can be phenotypically antibiotic resistant, resulting in rapid biofilm re-establishment post-treatment.38   Potential therapies include conjugation-based delivery systems for antimicrobial toxins39   and CRISPR-Cas-based approaches that can either destroy target pathogens or their antimicrobial resistance.40  , 41   In addition to the search for new or modified antimicrobials and anti-virulence therapeutics,38  , 42  , 43   pathogens of microbes such as bacteriophages44   and bacterivorous bacteria like Bdellovibrio  are being explored. However, although phage therapy is relatively affordable and lends itself to use in lower-income settings (Goals 3 and 10), its development as a therapy is still in the early stages.45   Moreover, expanding lateral flow diagnostic tests to new target conditions is particularly compelling, as these tests are crucial in monitoring and managing rapidly emerging infections, can be used independently of, and hence reduce the burden on, health services,46   and can be manufactured at a fraction of the cost of accessing and maintaining healthcare and diagnostic infrastructure46   (Goals 3, 5, 9, and 10). Among the most promising targets for novel and holistic health interventions are the innovations in human microbiome technology. Microbiota have been identified in niches across the human body and even de novo  tumor environments.11  , 47   Gut microbiota are essential for normal development of the immune, metabolic, and nervous systems,48  , 49  , 50   and are involved in many processes regulating central, but also distal, bodily functions, e.g., via the gut-brain51   or gut-skeletal muscle52   axes. Balanced and healthy gut microbiota are essential for healthy gut physiology, including resistance to infection, metabolizing foods, producing vitamins and amino acids, and degrading non-digestible carbohydrates (Goals 2 and 3). However, microbiota and their metabolites have been implicated in a range of disorders, such as atherosclerosis, cancer, and depression.53  , 54   In addition, by metabolizing endo- or xenobiotic entities, microbiota control the impact of such compounds on the host, including the effectiveness of health interventions like chemotherapy or vaccination.55   The substantial recent interest in developing microbiota-targeting interventions that address cancer; disorders of the metabolic, (neuro-)muscular, and respiratory systems; and skeletal, dermatological, and communicable diseases attests to the promise of managing many diseases by microbiota modulation.56   Yet, significant challenges exist for pertinent innovation (and regulation) due to the significant variability in microbiota composition within and across individuals, ill-understood microbial behaviors in different micro-environments, and varying treatment responses.56   A case exemplifying the long timelines for the introduction of highly promising microbiota-based interventions into standard practice is fecal microbiota transplant (FMT). While a Dutch randomized controlled trial in 2010 found that FMT was superior to standard treatment (vancomycin) for treating recurrent Clostridium difficile  infection (rCDI)57   and other trials have confirmed these findings,58   the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did not grant regulatory approval for FMT treatment of rCDI until 2023. While there are good reasons for the delay of the decision to 2023, chiefly based on safety and quality concerns relating inter alia  to donor screening, proper handling of fecal matter, and risks of undetected infectious agents or food allergens,59  , 60   this case shows how long it can take for convincing evidence to be gathered and accepted. Also, more recent trial modes, such as N-of-1 studies in individuals (see Davidson et al.61  ), deserve more attention to find optimally personalized microbiota-based health and disease management strategies (Goals 3, 9, and 10). A better understanding of microbiota behaviors, metabolism of xenobiotics (chemicals present in organisms that are not naturally produced), and both adverse events and synergies with other interventions such as antimicrobials and phages is needed. Achieving this across complex microbiomes will require development of scalable capture and characterization approaches like viral tag and grow.62   Disease susceptibility and responses to prophylaxis and therapy vary significantly among individuals, due in part to human genetic and physiological variations, age, nutrition and lifestyle, and environmental and socio-economical settings, but also in part to variations in microbiomes. As a result, many one-size-fits-all healthcare approaches have unacceptably high failure rates. Rapid transition to precision (personalized) medicine is essential. The complexity of integrating all of the contributing parameters in precision medicine, especially the complex variables of microbiome composition and function, will require serious involvement of artificial intelligence.63  , 64   Despite the enormous potential of microbial technologies to address many current challenges, it seems likely that challenges will continue to increase, in particular the problem of decreasing access to healthcare, especially in low-resource settings, given rising costs of healthcare, the increasing human population, the aging population, global warming, increasing economic and social inequalities, and increasing displacement of peoples into informal settlements and refugee camps. Some of the longer-term policies to confront these challenges are, by necessity, likely to be disruptive. To secure the success of such policies, it will be important that they are evidence-based, accountable, and supported by the general public. This requires raising the level of understanding of relevant issues in society, especially where societal participation in implementation of policies is required (e.g., in greater engagement of individuals in their own healthcare64  ). Global education—especially of children in school but also of adults in the context of lifelong learning, tertiary education, and other settings—in relevant aspects of healthcare will be crucial for confronting global healthcare challenges in the long term. Global education benefits Goal 3 for certain, but also Goals 4, 5, and 10. A concept for education in societally relevant microbiology was recently developed that could serve as a model for global education in healthcare and other societally important issues.65     Food production and nutrition SDGs: 1 , 2 , 3 , 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 Inadequate food availability and access is a major contributor to global poverty (Goal 1), hunger (Goal 2), poor health and nutrition (Goal 3), and inequality (Goals 5 and 10). Soil, plant, and animal microorganisms are vital for regulating sustainable food production, decreasing waste, and improving food distribution and access, and so have the potential to significantly alleviate these pressures.13  , 66   Making better use of microbial biotechnology in food systems will also help to reach key SDG targets of reducing food waste (Goal 12), greenhouse gas emissions (Goal 13), and pollution of soil, water, and air (Goals 6, 11, 14, and 15). Microbial-based methods are already providing promising alternatives to the use of synthetic chemicals in food systems (e.g., as pesticides and fertilizers) that are harmful to the environment and human health.13  , 67   For example, microbial inocula such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi or SynComs (synthetic microbial communities co-cultured to mimic the native microbiome68  ) can help to restore soil functions and increase plant yields and disease resistance, reducing reliance on artificial pesticides and fertilizers.69  , 70   These solutions are becoming increasingly important as climate change and land use change continue to drive the degradation of soils across the globe. Promoting the functioning of soil microorganisms is increasingly critical for plant resilience and nutrient access as soil conditions become increasingly harsh.71   While microbial inoculants are a promising strategy to improve plant health, approval of such products in Europe currently requires field tests that confirm increases in crop yields.72   Nonetheless, failure may occur due to soil characteristics and competition by Indigenous microbiota. To overcome potential failures, biostimulant products derived from microbes are being developed. In a recent study, root irrigation with solid fermentation products of Streptomyces  strain 769 significantly reduced watermelon Fusarium  wilt disease incidence by 30% and increased plant biomass by 150% in a continuous cropping field.73   Pre- and probiotics can also improve livestock growth and health and reduce harmful byproducts such as methane,74  , 75   as well as strengthen fish immune responses and food digestion in aquaculture.76   Biological control, whereby microbial antagonists are used to inhibit pathogen growth directly or indirectly through immune priming,77   also offers an eco-friendly and cost-effective approach for managing diseases in plant and animal food systems. However, current methods are constrained by inconsistent efficacy in field conditions and limited product diversity.67   More research is needed to ensure products are viable and can provide the desired outcomes in field conditions. New breeding strategies that focus on evolving symbioses78   or breeding for traits that attract and maintain beneficial microbes via quantitative trait loci (QTLs) could also be harnessed to improve plant and animal health.79   Integrating ecological theory (e.g., metacommunity theory, priority effects) to identify and develop microbes that can compete against pathogens and successfully colonize plants, or to alter microbiomes to be resistant to environmental disruption, could be used to help achieve this.79   In addition to the use of microbial amendments and products to increase efficiencies in plant and animal food systems, microbial protein can provide an important food source for humans and animals with reduced environmental impact.80   Emerging technologies like precision fermentation can produce the proteins, fats, and carbohydrates traditionally sourced from plants and animals.81  , 82   Mycoprotein is already a well-established food source, with the potential to reduce up to 583 MtCO2  equivalents per year83   and limit the use of freshwater, antibiotics, pesticides, and fertilizers.80   Additionally, precision foods and complements based on pre-, pro, sym-, or postbiotics are being increasingly explored to promote healthy gut microbiota or treat dysbiosis. For example, a recent review84   highlighted future developments based on genetic engineering of microbes to improve the nutritional quality of foods across a range of applications, such as ingredient production for live therapeutics, single-cell proteins for improving nutritional profiles, or cell-produced animal flavorings to allow meat and dairy alternatives to more closely resemble the products that they substitute.84   However, while many of these applications are considered promising, research remains limited regarding their safety profiles and effectiveness in achieving concrete and reproducible health outcomes. As a consequence, important regulators (e.g., the European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration) are hesitant to grant health claims, i.e., approving live biotherapeutic product status, which is a necessary prerequisite for reimbursement.85   Therefore, a large proportion of microbiota-based health intervention developers remain somewhat focused on markets in which health claims historically have also been granted for alternative forms of medicine, such as China, where interventions based on Chinese traditional medicine receive regulatory approval and can be reimbursed.56   It remains to be seen when the evidence base matures and for microbiota-based food interventions to become mainstream in Western markets. Efforts to improve poverty, hunger, health, and inequality must extend beyond increasing food production and include improvements in food distribution and accessibility. Over 30% of food is wasted during or post production,86   with microbes both contributing to and mitigating this issue. Microbes cause disease and post-harvest spoilage, but they can also reduce waste through pre- and post-harvest biocontrol methods. Although various microbial treatments have been tested, their widespread application remains limited due to inconsistent effects and a lack of industry adoption.86  , 87   Effective food preservation methods involve the implementation of the cold chain, airtight packaging, pH control, and moisture reduction to inhibit growth of spoilage microbes. Additionally, targeted fermentation by specific microorganisms (e.g., lactic bacteria and yeast) has been used by humans for millennia to preserve food and enhance flavor. Fermentation is affordable, scalable, adaptable, and safe when proper controls are in place,88   and it can extend the shelf life of food products. However, a deeper understanding of the post-harvest microbiome is needed to develop more robust and scalable biocontrol and food storage methods.86   Making better use of microbial technology to enhance food production and nutrition will indirectly benefit numerous SDGs in addition to directly addressing the SDGs discussed above. Reducing hunger, poverty, disease, and inequality (Goals 1, 2, 3, and 10) will improve the ability of people to pursue education (Goal 4), likely open up new development opportunities for women (Goal 5), and have long-term positive effects on community well-being and peace (Goals 11 and 16). Improved health and nutrition will also improve the ability of people to contribute to the local and national economy (Goal 8). Additionally, the global food production system is a driver of climate change (Goal 13) and ecosystem destruction, and bioengineering of the soil microbiota can indeed reduce the climate impact.89  , 90   Improving the efficiency and sustainability of food systems, as well as making better use of microbes as food products, will also reduce negative impacts on natural terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (Goals 14 and 15).   Clean energy production SDGs: 6, 7 , 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13  International reliance on fossil fuels for energy extraction, transportation, and consumption contributes to numerous social and environmental injustices, including energy inaccessibility, pollution at sites of extraction and during transportation, and the disproportionate burden of climate change on developing countries.91   Development and deployment of microbial resources toward clean energy production will directly assist in achieving affordable and clean energy (Goal 7), and systems that simultaneously reduce and remove greenhouse gas emissions will support efforts toward climate action (Goal 13). Realizing this ambitious vision would set society on a path to develop a resilient supply of energy that can respond to events, natural or otherwise, that disrupt supply chains, achieve the NetZero emissions predictions of the International Energy Agency and the IPCC climate pathway reductions, and allow numerous new communities to reap the economic and other benefits of producing some or all of their own energy.92   Achieving this vision in a responsible manner dictates that microbial bioenergy be only one of multiple solutions that take into account responsible management of natural resources, science-based and transparent accounting for carbon, initiatives to protect ecosystem biodiversity, and systems to support and include as many communities as possible.93   If done right, moving toward microbial bioenergy will transform the world's industry and infrastructure (Goal 9) and lead toward responsible consumption and production (Goal 12) by re-modeling energy grids and storage systems that must be built to accommodate bioenergy sources. Microbe-based clean energy systems that use abundant renewable agricultural, municipal, and industrial residues will also support efforts toward improving clean water and sanitation (Goal 6) by reducing overall energy consumption and expanding the availability of sustainable wastewater treatment solutions. Additionally, recent models predict that changes in agricultural practices for food, energy, and chemical production will lead to many positive environmental impacts for greenhouse gas reduction and climate mitigation.94  , 95   Altogether, harnessing microbial biotechnology and resources for clean energy will ultimately contribute to more sustainable cities and communities (Goal 11). In many industrialized nations, transportation fuels, including aviation, marine, shipping, and automotive sectors, account for over 30% of petroleum consumption (see https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/us-energy-facts/ ). Microbes offer the potential to produce cost-effective biofuels from billions of tons of organic materials, including non-food animal and crop material, as well as agricultural, municipal, and industrial byproducts.12   Recent studies have demonstrated that the greenhouse gas emissions associated with biological production of ethanol, butanol, and ethylene are 32%–55% less than use of petroleum.96  , 97   The potential environmental and socio-economic benefits are substantial, offering regions the opportunity to shift from fuel importers to producers, utilizing locally abundant raw materials, and curtailing environmental hazards of transportation.98  , 99   However, integrating microbe-generated biofuels into a circular economy requires innovative scientific approaches and changes in agricultural and industrial practices. Autotrophic microorganisms, encompassing algae, bacteria, and archaea, possess the unique ability to capture carbon directly from the atmosphere or industrial waste gases, converting them into fuels. This represents the potential for producing net zero carbon emission biofuels.100   However, the number of biofuels naturally produced by autotrophic bacteria is limited to methane and acetic acid. Through genetic and metabolic engineering, autotrophs have been the potential to produce a wider array of fuels, including methane, ethylene and butanol, biological oil, and hydrogen,101  , 102   but the cost of biofuel production remains high.103   Challenges involved in scaling growth in industrial settings and enhancing fuel production efficiency (particularly in photosynthetic bacteria) must be overcome to reduce the gap in productions costs between biofuels and petroleum so that this technology can be more widely adopted.103   Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, but it is also an abundant carbon feedstock for microbes. It can be converted into valuable products such as bioplastics, biofuels, nutraceuticals, and single-cell proteins.104   Furthermore, the transition into a hydrogen-based fuel economy is rapidly increasing the production of low-cost methanol, a versatile feedstock for bioconversion. Methylotrophic microorganisms utilize methane or methanol as sole carbon and energy sources, driving their bioconversion into value-added products.105   Global-scale implementation of these methods requires advancement of genetic tools, adaptation to industrial conditions, and optimized bioreactor and bioprocess design.106   Potential environmental benefits, including significant reductions in methane emissions and potential removal of atmospheric methane, underscore the importance of this microbial approach to mitigating climate change. An estimated 50,000–300,000 methanotrophic bioreactors are predicted to absorb 240 megatons of methane over 20 years.107   The reduction of atmospheric methane will become more critical with upscaling of hydrogen production due to the depletion of the hydroxyl radical sink by hydrogen release to the atmosphere that will extend the residence time of methane, thus increasing its global warming potential.108   In summary, microorganisms can provide important contributions to the transformation of energy production and reduce greenhouse gas emissions (Goals 7, 9, 12, and 13). Because microbes can be cultivated across the globe by all nations and can grow using diverse local feedstocks, they have the potential to facilitate a transition toward affordable and clean energy by 2030. As such, they also have the potential to support efforts to reduce inequalities (Goal 10) and to promote decent work and economic growth (Goal 8). However, concerted efforts in scientific innovation, agricultural and industrial practices, and global collaboration are essential to realizing the full potential of microbial solutions in shaping a sustainable energy future.   Synthesizing and recycling products SDGs: 3, 6, 7, 8, 9 , 10, 12 , 13, 14, 15 20th  century society converted billions of liters of petroleum yearly into a variety of chemicals and materials. Most of this multi-trillion dollar per year industry is located in a few well-developed countries and uses processes that have a negative environmental impact. For these and other reasons, there have been recent calls to create a circular bioeconomy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and generate products from renewable raw materials109  , 110  , 111   (Figure 3  ). The contribution of a circular bioeconomy to a 21st  century industrial revolution is large since estimates are that up to 60% of the inputs to the global economy could, in principle, be produced biologically.111   Below, we make the case that microbes can generate low greenhouse gas chemicals and materials while providing economic and environmental benefits to citizens and communities around the world (Goals 7, 9, 12, and 13). Available renewable raw materials to feed this circular bioeconomy include billions of tons of organic residues that involve non-food animal and plant material, crops grown specifically for conversion into chemicals and materials, manure, waste from municipal and industrial activities, as well as carbon dioxide sequestered from the atmosphere or generated by industry.12  , 112  , 113  , 114   The majority of these organic residues are either combusted (releasing carbon dioxide) as a source of heat and power or released to the environment, which can contribute to phosphorous or nitrogen accumulation and have other negative ecosystem impacts. While developing a circular bioeconomy to generate valuable products from these abundant raw materials will require changes in agricultural and industrial practices (Goal 9), its environmental, economic, and societal benefits (Goals 3, 6, 10, 13, 14, and 15) are enormous given the availability of raw materials in well- and less-developed regions across the globe.98  , 99   Microbes can serve as catalysts to power a new circular bioeconomy. Microbes have performed chemical transformations longer than humans and operate as circular economies themselves. These ubiquitous organisms have driven the evolution of and supported life on the planet, and processes based on their activity can be environmentally and economically sustainable (Goals 7, 9, 12, and 13). Examples include microbial production of hydrocarbons and hydrogen, the >100-year-old industrial use of acetone and butanol fermentations,115   and using microbial nitrogen fixation to reduce dependence on fertilizer generated by the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process.101  , 102  , 116   While still in its infancy, there are both emerging and existing examples of the potential for industry to harness the metabolic power of microbes to convert an abundant supply of industrial carbon monoxide and dioxide into cost-competitive bio-based fuels, chemicals, and textiles.117   In addition, studies and initiatives have both identified bottlenecks or demonstrated the ability to generate cost-competitive microbial products from abundant non-food lignocellulosic biomass118   and dairy coproduct residues.119   These examples provide a roadmap for how to develop microbial factories that convert other abundant raw materials into a suite of valuable chemicals and materials with local, regional, and global markets.120  , 121   The time is ripe to develop microbial cell factories. Recent advances in genomics have uncovered a plethora of previously unknown microbial activities with potential societal utility.109  , 122   Genomic datasets also provide an ever-growing set of existing and modified genes to deploy for low-cost synthesis of hydrocarbon fuels, methane, substitutes for petrochemicals, or even other compounds that cannot be generated in a cost- or environmentally effective manner by today’s industries (Goal 9). Tapping the chemical potential locked in the genomes of native or engineered microbes, or the combined activity of microbial communities, can help design new biological catalysts for a circular bioeconomy.122   The potential exists for either use of the resulting microbial products directly or after they are chemically modified to increase their societal value and utility. Life cycle analysis predicts that the benefits of a circular bioeconomy will be maximized by locating biorefineries near the raw materials and infrastructure needed to move materials from producers to consumers.123   Success will ultimately require models that accurately predict raw material supply, costs of purchase and transport to refineries, and expenses to produce, purify, and distribute products.99  , 123   Supply chain models predict that a microbe-powered circular bioeconomy can provide new high-technology and other jobs to both industrialized nations and less-developed regions, especially if one considers producing materials locally and moving raw materials from depots to centralized facilities of different scales.20  , 110  , 124  , 125   It would also be an integral part of an agile supply chain that can respond to changes in raw material supply or consumer demand (Goals 8 and 11). While the cost of building and operating these biorefineries will require public and private sector support, the return on this investment can be substantial, especially in low-income regions of the world that need industrial development (Goals 9 and 11). For example, a microbe-powered circular bioeconomy can provide new high-value economic opportunities to raw materials producers, attract considerable investment, increase highly skilled domestic workforces, and, in turn, improve education and personal financial stability, especially in less-developed and low-income regions of the globe110  , 111   (Goals 10, 11, and 12). Moving to a microbe-powered circular bioeconomy can create a new industrial ecosystem that is sustainable, resilient to natural or geopolitical disruptions in supply chains, generates decarbonized products from local renewable raw materials, and provides socio-economic opportunities to more regions of the globe. Over time, movement to a microbe-powered circular bioeconomy will pay considerable dividends to the planet and its inhabitants.   Bioremediation SDGs: 1, 2, 3 , 6 , 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 , 15  Current and past industrial and agricultural activities have left us with a legacy of polluted habitats around the world that threaten human health (Goal 3), the functioning of natural ecosystems (Goals 14 and 15), and their ecosystem services such as safe food (Goal 2) and clean water126   (Goal 6). Bioremediation is a nature-based process that employs living organisms (e.g., bacteria, archaea, fungi, and microalgae and/or their metabolic products) to remove, detoxify, immobilize, and extract contaminants (e.g., hydrocarbons, polychlorobiphenyls, pesticides, herbicides, and/or heavy metals) in a variety of environmental matrices (e.g., soils, sediments, and water).127   Bioremediation interventions can use different approaches, including the enhancement of the capability of natural microbial assemblages to degrade/stabilize contaminants (e.g., biostimulation through the addition of nutrients or bioventing through the insufflation of oxygen) and the addition of microorganisms with desired remediation capabilities to the host or environment (i.e., bioaugmentation128  ). Bioremediation allows an efficient, safe, and cost-effective decontamination of environmental matrices to levels that cannot be achieved by conventional treatments (e.g., pyrolysis, landfilling, and soil washing).129  , 130   In addition, it reduces the risks of secondary contamination and ensures a lower carbon footprint131  , 132   (Goal 13). A biostimulation experiment based on the addition of inorganic nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous) to sediments highly contaminated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) revealed a >90% reduction in PAH and greater environmental benefits (estimated in terms of CO2  equivalents) compared with traditional approaches (i.e., disposal of sediments in landfill areas).132   Microbial bioremediation has been proven to be effective for wastewater treatment to degrade recalcitrant contaminants (e.g., landfill leachates, textiles, and pharmaceutical wastes), which are generally left untreated by conventional wastewater processes. Bacterial and fungal enzymes such as azoreductase, lignin peroxidase, and laccase, as well as microalgae (e.g., Chlorella vulgaris  UMACC 001), can accelerate the degradation of persistent organic dyes in textile wastewater.133  , 134   Microbial bioremediation can also degrade toxic compounds while transforming organic waste into biofertilizers and biofuels, thus being highly cost-effective135   (Goal 8). Microbial bioremediation can also contribute to plastic pollution abatement, especially of micro- and nano-plastics that are extremely difficult to remove using traditional approaches. Most global plastic production ends up in the ocean,136   with plastic pollution found from the surface down to the deep seafloor.137  , 138  , 139   The microbial communities colonizing plastic surfaces140   include bacteria and fungi and “pit-forming” microbes that modify the surface of plastics,141   contributing to the degradation of several polymers.142  , 143   For example, the plastic-degrading bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis  is able to slowly degrade polyethylene terephthalate, commonly known as PET.144   A crucial first step is the enzymatic breakdown of the plastic polymer into its monomers terephthalate and ethylene glycol, which are used by the bacterium as a carbon source for growth. The monomers can also be recycled to produce new plastics in an environmentally friendly way.145  , 146   Companies are beginning to scale up this process, with the company CarBios announcing a new plant opening in 2025 that aims to recycle 50,000 tons of PET plastic per year.147   PET is just one kind of plastic, and other plastics will have their own challenges.148  , 149   Yet, further research investment has the potential to lead to new technologies that can contribute to the clean-up of plastic pollution (Goals 6 and 14). Among bioremediation approaches, rhizoremediation, exploiting the high potential of root-associated microorganisms to degrade organic pollutants, appears to be particularly effective in improving the success of phytoremediation of contaminated soils.150   For example, the rhizoremediation of agricultural soils in Italy heavily polluted by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) reduced the concentration of such contaminants by approximately 20% in 18 months.151   Other investigations at a German site historically contaminated by diesel fuel hydrocarbons revealed that rhizoremediation can enhance biodegradation by up to 96% in 60 days.152   With the advent of -omics approaches, it has been possible to identify key rhizome microbiomes and their metabolites with unprecedented resolution, thus implementing microbiome-assisted restoration actions not only of terrestrial plants but also of mangroves and seagrasses.153   However, rhizoremediation is still not widely adopted by accredited soil remediation experts, partly due to the inconsistencies in results (depending on the soil type and plants used), the slow time frame required to achieve outcomes, and a lack of communication between scientists and practitioners.154   More research is needed to develop more consistent methods that could be adopted at larger scales.154   Microbial fuel cells are an innovative bioremediation practice in which metabolic activities of electroactive bacteria (such as such as Geobacter , Shewanella , Pseudomonas , and Rhodoferax )155   transform organic and inorganic matter into bioelectricity.156   This allows electricity to be generated from wastewater treatment plants, reducing operating costs and energy consumption.157   Microbial fuel cells can generate around 30 W m−2  of electricity, ∼1 m3  day−1  of biohydrogen, and incomes of as much as $2,498.77 × 10−2 /(W m−2 ) annually through wastewater treatment and energy generation alone.157   Bioleaching is a remediation process used to naturally extract metals (e.g., copper, zinc, lead, lithium, and nickel) from different matrices (e.g., electronic waste, mobile phones, spent batteries, and other mineral waste) by exploiting the microbial ability to oxidize minerals. This approach is an eco-sustainable alternative to (highly impacting) traditional metallurgical processes (e.g., conventional fusion).158  , 159   Among fungi, the Aspergillus  and Penicillium  genera appear to be the most effective in biological leaching. These genera have been employed for metal extraction from oxidic ores of different metals (e.g., nickel, iron, chromium, titanium and quartz sands, refractory gold, silver, copper manganese, cobalt, and zinc).160   Among bacteria, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans  and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans  can efficiently mobilize the main metals of electronic waste (i.e., copper in printed wire boards) together with other metals, such as zinc and lead.161   Based on existing information, bioleaching is a valuable approach for the management of mine waste, reducing the environmental impact of mining activities and the release of toxic elements, thus facilitating the safe and efficient recovery of metals.129   The implementation of eco-compatible bioremediation can contribute to the renewable energy sector and to sustainable economic growth (Goals 7 and 8). At the same time, the implementation of microbial bioremediation can provide a relevant contribution to the sustainable management of waste (Goal 12) and the health of polluted terrestrial (and 15) and marine (Goals 14) habitats. As a result, these impacts are directly relevant for improving human health and well-being (Goal 3), ensuring better access to natural resources (Goal 6), basic services (Goals 1, 2, and 11), and fairer living conditions around the world (Goal 10). Yet, although bioremediation has great potential, many polluted sites contain complex mixtures of contaminants that present microbes with significant metabolic and ecophysiological challenges. Moreover, the implementation of bioremediation solutions at large spatial scales remains challenging, particularly under changing environmental conditions132   (Goal 9). To carry out such interventions, it will be necessary to develop an integrated approach including the best bioremediation techniques and the advanced engineering technologies (including remote sensing and GIS-based mapping) to assess the extent of contamination/damage and to understand the spatial and temporal variations of the impacted sites.162     Facilitating healthy ecosystems SDGs: 1, 2, 3, 6 , 11, 13 , 14 , 15  Microorganisms overwhelmingly dominate the diversity of life on Earth, with an estimated 1 trillion species existing across the globe.3   In addition, microbes shape the biochemical landscape by performing important metabolic functions,8   including photosynthetic oxygen production, the degradation of organic molecules, nitrogen fixation, detoxification, nutrient release, and transformation of greenhouse gases. All of these processes are fundamental to supporting life in terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems and are vital to the health and well-being of humanity. As such, by maintaining the functionality of both natural and managed ecosystems, microbes play a key role in generating clean water (Goal 6), the regulation of our climate (Goal 13), life below water (Goal 14), and life on land (Goal 15). When anthropogenic factors such as ecological degradation and climate change lead to the breakdown of microbial communities, they fundamentally undermine the capacity of ecosystems to support other life.16  , 71   As such, there is growing awareness of the need to include microbial diversity into conservation planning, both to protect the high diversity that microbes represent and to preserve ecological functioning.16  , 163   To facilitate more targeted conservation of microbial diversity, a growing body of research has begun to explore and characterize hotspots of microbial diversity across the globe.163  , 164   However, in general, there is little spatial overlap between the regions of high microbial diversity and existing protected areas across the globe, with a possible 67.5% of microbial biodiversity hotspot regions existing outside of protected areas (Figure 4  ). This highlights the need for conservation priorities to be readjusted if they intend to protect microbial diversity and its associated ecosystem services. Along with improving efforts to conserve existing microbial biodiversity, there is a growing awareness of the need to restore microbial communities that have been degraded. Indeed, the soil microbiome often represents a key limiting factor for ecosystem recovery in both natural and managed ecosystems.16   Across the globe, inoculants of diverse soil communities (e.g., via soil transplants, spore extracts, and cultured strains) have been shown to increase ecosystem recovery by an average of 64%.16   It is likely that these impacts are driven by increases in soil metabolism and stability that enhance plant growth, survival, and biodiversity,167   and the effects tend to have the greatest beneficial impacts in more degraded soils.168   Direct manipulation of the microbiome will be enabled through much-needed work identifying when and where different types of inoculation are successful. Microbiome-based approaches (including the use of probiotics) are also being used to control diseases in wild animal populations.169   However, because land use practices and climate change impact different ecosystems in different ways,14   microbiome-based approaches need to be tailored to the target system. In order to avoid the damaging impacts of invasive species and maximize the beneficial impacts on ecological recovery, microbial inoculations or transplants are most effective when using native species from nearby local environments.168   Metagenomic sequencing and other “omics” approaches170   can provide valuable information regarding microbial diversity and functional capacity and can be used as biomonitoring tools to assess microbial communities in restoration interventions.171  , 172   Despite the potential of microbes to improve ecosystem health, substantial research is still needed to make full and informed use of microbial biotechnology in land conservation and restoration practices across agricultural, urban, and natural ecosystems. Microbial inoculation methods are not yet widely implemented in the field, and scaling-up methods to be applied at the landscape level requires further development and full evaluation of risks.16  , 79  , 173   However, a growing body of evidence supports the potential for native, diverse microbial communities to improve yields in both natural and managed environments.174  , 175   Similarly, methods to control disease in animal populations need to be optimized, as they often need to be applied repeatedly or at specific stages of the life cycle.169   Because the majority of microbial species remain undiscovered,3   significant investment is needed to improve our understanding of the potential for using microorganisms to restore life on land (Goal 15). As well as enhancing ecological recovery, microbes can also represent an important biological control tool for limiting the spread of invasive or harmful species. For example, across the globe, harmful algal and cyanobacterial blooms and waterborne pathogens (e.g., Vibrio cholerae  and Salmonella typhi ) represent key threats to the water quality of lakes, rivers, and coastal waters176   (Goals 6 and 14). Microbial-mediated reduction of nutrient loads can be managed to help suppress damaging algal blooms177   and can yield pathogen reduction co-benefits,178   even though benefits may take years to accrue if high amounts of nutrients have already accumulated in the sediments. Recent research on microbial control of harmful algal blooms has identified several viruses, bacteria, and fungi that show algicidal activity,179  , 180  , 181   as well as microorganisms that can degrade algal toxins182   (Goal 6). Over 30% of people in tropical countries are directly dependent on nature for their basic needs,183   and the rest of the global economy is indirectly underpinned by the existence of natural ecosystems. As such, microbial solutions to improve the health and diversity of natural ecosystems will ensure that these systems continue to provide a sustainable source of food and clean water (Goals 1, 2, 6, and 11) and that disease outbreaks are reduced in frequency and severity (Goal 3).   Global biogeochemical cycles and climate change SDGs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 Microbes have been central drivers of the evolution of Earth’s atmosphere over the last 3 billion years, including the oxygenation of the Earth’s early atmosphere that allowed life to flourish and higher forms of life to evolve (Goals 14 and 15). They remain primary drivers of modern-day carbon and nutrient cycling across the globe.164   As such, they play a crucial role in regulating the atmospheric composition and climate. Currently, there are growing concerns that the climate-induced acceleration of microbial-mediated biogeochemical processes has the potential to accelerate CO2  emissions into the atmosphere.15  , 184   However, the scale of these biochemical impacts means that they also have the potential to act as a powerful ally in achieving Goal 13 of “climate action” if we can capitalize on solutions that enhance the microbially mediated mitigation of CO2  (carbon dioxide), CH4  (methane), and N2 O (nitrous oxide) emissions.185   Land use change and agriculture provide considerable opportunities for deliberate mitigation of global warming using microbes. As mentioned above, microbial inoculations that enhance productivity and soil carbon sequestration have the potential to enhance carbon storage in both managed ecological health168   and natural167   ecosystems. Moreover, any mechanisms that enhance photosynthesis and/or reduce the rate of organic carbon mineralization will also increase terrestrial carbon sequestration. In particular, the restoration of degraded peatlands, for instance, could yield a microbially mediated reduction in emissions of around 0.8 Gt of CO2  equivalents per year by 2030186   (Goals 13 and 15). Soil amendments such as biochar and compost can also enhance carbon sequestration by increasing its recalcitrance to microbial decomposition, while microbial uptake and deposition of root-exuded carbon compounds in the rhizosphere of deep-rooted perennial grasses could also be leveraged to enhance soil carbon stocks.185   The use of microbes to reduce CO2  emissions is already well established in the form of biofuel production, either via conversion of lignocellulosic feedstocks or as the feedstock itself (e.g., microalgae). Microbially mediated CH4  fluxes dominate anthropogenic emissions, with ruminant livestock, waste management, and rice agriculture all being significant global sources.187   Improved feed quality and feed additives are proven methods to reduce CH4  emissions from enteric fermentation during the digestion process in ruminants. There is also potential for systematic selection of the gut microbiome in ruminant livestock through genomic selection of low-emission traits.188   Additionally, microbially derived meat substitutes can reduce reliance on ruminants, thereby cutting associated emissions.81   In the waste management sector, options range from enhancing aeration of wastes (to limit methanogenesis) through encouragement of methanotrophy (e.g., landfill cover soils) to deliberately optimizing methanogenesis to generate CH4  for substitution of fossil fuels (e.g., anaerobic digestion). In rice agriculture, established microbially mediated approaches to mitigation of CH4  emissions, such as drainage and harvest residue management, could be complemented by development of new rice cultivars aimed at modifying root carbon allocation.101   N2 O emissions from soils and sediments, produced by microbes, are increasing due to human-induced nitrogen enrichment.189   Nitrogen fertilization of farmlands is the main contributor, with spill-over effects on natural ecosystems (Goal 15). Significant mitigation relies on modifying microbial nitrogen transformations in farmed soils. N2 O is a by-product of ammonia oxidation, and inhibiting ammonia-oxidizing bacteria that produce more N2 O than their archaeal counterparts is a promising approach. Denitrifying bacteria are also attractive targets because reducing their overall N2 O/N2  product ratio (R ) determines farmland emissions of N2 O. Lime application lowers R  by promoting synthesis of functional N2 O-reductase.190   Another promising approach is bioaugmentation of denitrifying bacteria that reduce, but do not produce, N2 O.191   Such bacteria can be effectively vectored by organic waste, with a relatively long-lasting effect on N2 O emissions, if selected for the ability to grow in organic waste and soil.192   Field experiments demonstrated a 50%–95% reduction of N2 O-emission by fertilization with organic waste in which such bacteria had been grown to high cell densities.90   The technology has the potential to reduce European-wide anthropogenic N2 O emissions by 5%–20%.90   Marine and freshwater systems contribute ∼50% of global primary production, largely driven by the photosynthetic activity of cyanobacteria and unicellular eukaryotic algae. Hence, aquatic microorganisms play a key role in global carbon sequestration and provide the energy to drive aquatic food webs (Goal 14). Aquatic microorganisms also play an important role in climate regulation through the production and release of organic compounds to the atmosphere that subsequently influence aerosol loads, aerosol properties, and cloud formation.193  , 194  , 195   However, aquatic microbiomes are also highly sensitive to climate-driven stressors, including increased water column (density) stratification and nutrient stress from climate warming, ocean acidification from rising atmospheric carbon dioxide, oxygen depletion, and extreme climatic events (e.g., marine heatwaves).15  , 196   Impacts of these cumulative stressors include shifts in microbial diversity and species composition, changes in primary productivity, disease outbreaks, altered nutrient or gas cycling (including the enhanced release of potent greenhouse gases such as methane), and disruption of symbiotic and virus-microbe interactions.197  , 198   Microbial solutions to climate-driven stressors in water include natural processes and those that humans might manipulate and harness. It is essential that we understand the ramifications of both. Natural processes include metabolic feedbacks that buttress shifts in substrate availability. For example, some phytoplankton upregulate nitrogen fixation under ocean acidification,199   thereby partially compensating for decreasing upwelling of nutrients.200   Other phenomena influenced by climate change, such as the gradual loss of oxygen from the subsurface ocean and coastal waters201  , 202   are associated with microbial communities producing and consuming potent greenhouse gases (e.g., methane and nitrous oxide).203   Warming hastens respiratory return of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, thereby decreasing carbon deposition to marine sediments (positive climate feedback).204   Warming may also elevate plankton nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratios, thereby increasing carbon sequestration (negative climate feedback) because carbon-to-nitrogen ratios are relatively invariable.205   Encouragingly, this natural complexity suggests potentially overlooked microbial constraints on climate-driven phenomena. Some emerging lines of research highlight the potential to harness microbial processes for large-scale geoengineering to enhance carbon sequestration (e.g., iron fertilization of the oceans).206   Although such large-scale mechanisms may not yet be advisable without considerable advances in our understanding of the downstream consequences,206  , 207   many microbial solutions at local scales present more manageable options. For example, biofuel production involving freshwater and coastal microbes may provide an alternative for fossil fuels, with the potential to reduce arable land demands from traditional biofuel production.208   Furthermore, microbial conversion of methane to high-value bioproducts (e.g., methanol and biodegradable plastics) may offer a sustainable solution to reduce greenhouse gas emission.209   In all these cases, accelerating bioengineering research is needed, including expanded libraries of genetically manipulatable strains and upscaling of culturing techniques to improve potential economic benefits of biofuel production and other forms of microbial carbon sequestration. Microbes therefore underpin global fluxes and the potential for mitigation of all 3 major anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Improved understanding and greater application of microbial ecology—such as through manipulation of plant-soil-microbial interactions or marine primary producers to enhance net carbon gain—has the potential to make a very significant contribution toward improving climate action (Goal 13) and subsequently life in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems (Goals 14 and 15). Given the multifaceted implications of climate change for poverty, hunger, healthcare, clean water, and education,210   microbial-based climate mitigation solutions have the capacity to contribute to numerous other SDGs (Goals 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 11, and 16).   Partnerships for the goals (Goal 17) SDG 17, “partnerships for the goals,” aims to strengthen ways of implementing the SDGs and revitalize global partnerships for achieving sustainable development.9   Our review highlights that the consideration of microbes and microbial-based technologies may be critical for achieving each of the SDGs. More importantly, this review reveals how microbial technologies have the potential to provide synergistic opportunities for achieving multiple SDGs simultaneously, facilitating collaboration and alignment in achieving those goals (Figures 2  and 5  ). For example, the central role of soil microbial diversity in promoting carbon storage on land164   suggests that efforts to promote healthy microbial communities can contribute synergistically to both climate (Goal 13) and biodiversity (Goals 14 and 15) goals.16   As such, explicitly recognizing this role of microbial diversity in the official documentation for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) can help provide a common lexicon to develop partnerships for organizations and governments to achieve both sustainability targets simultaneously. In Figure 5 , we highlight diverse microbial roles that are conceptually linked to achieving the SDGs, presenting different pathways for potential partnerships in achieving multiple sustainability targets. Some SDGs are more directly influenced by microbes than others (Figure 5 ). Specifically, microbes may not initially appear directly relevant for achieving quality education (Goal 4), gender equality (Goal 5), or peace, justice, and strong institutions (Goal 16). However, the highly interdependent nature of the SDGs means that microbial advances in other areas (e.g., food production, healthcare, and bioremediation) will have immediate knock-on consequences for all aspects of equity, peace, and justice. This becomes especially relevant for Indigenous communities that steward ∼80% of global biodiversity but are often overlooked in strategic global planning and excluded from the direct benefits provided by natural product development.211  , 212   Microbes are already being deployed in bioremediation efforts to decontaminate ecosystems disrupted by extractive mining projects that disproportionately impact marginalized communities,213   thereby contributing to equity SDGs. The plethora of microbially relevant interactions between SDGs that we have identified (Figure 5 ) illustrates that microbes can indeed accelerate progress toward all goals. Ultimately, the universal roles of microbes in driving biochemical processing of elements make them relevant to every aspect of sustainability. The clustering of microbial functions into 7 overarching areas (Figure 2 ) reveals the significant amount of overlap between the sustainability implications of different microbial solutions. While it is impossible to characterize the full dimensionality of these partnerships across all natural and human systems, our synthesis highlights clear clustering of microbial processes that are relevant for different groupings of SDGs (Figure 2 ). Increased familiarity of public and private sector decision-makers with these general microbial processes may be key to improving efforts to address the combined global sustainability challenges facing humanity in the coming century.  Conclusions Accelerating the transition toward a sustainable future requires that we capitalize on all tools in our arsenal, including those provided by the most ecologically diverse organisms with the most powerful catalytic capacity in the natural world. Our review highlights a range of microbial innovations that have the potential to facilitate a rapid transition toward a sustainable economy (Table 1  ). Our overarching conclusion—that microbial processes are fundamental to achieving the SDGs—may seem trivial, given that they underpin all life on Earth. However, the real insight is the extent of overlap in the importance of microbial innovations that can simultaneously help us accelerating progress toward achieving multiple sustainability agendas (see Figures 2  and 5 ). With increasing regulatory pressure for governments and organizations to achieve a range of sustainability targets, identifying common frameworks to address multiple goals is an urgent priority. The broad importance of microbial innovations means it is possible to identify synergies that can reveal pathways to achieving multiple sustainability targets. For example, if improving soil microbial diversity can contribute to our biodiversity (Goals 14 and 15), climate (Goal 13), and food security (Goal 2) goals, then it may present an efficient and cost-effective avenue for accelerating impact. Similarly, if microbial-based bioreactors can drive transitions toward sustainable energy production (Goal 7), materials transformations/production (Goal 12), and infrastructure (Goal 9), then they represent powerful opportunities for accelerating sustainable development. Such synergistic roles of microbial processes in facilitating sustainable transitions across different sectors highlight that they can provide decision-makers with a common lexicon for collective action toward simultaneously addressing multiple sustainability goals. Given the ubiquitous roles of microbial research and technology across all SDGs, it is surprising that microorganisms remain largely absent from the intergovernmental policy agreements and multilateral treaties of the United Nations. At the highest level, the biggest challenge is public and political awareness of the central role of microorganisms and changing behavioral norms so that the necessary microbial solutions can be adopted.214   Funding for downstream development is another critical hurdle limiting the widespread adoption of microbial technologies. As such, the scaling of microbial innovations will require the establishment of proactive financial and regulatory policies that recognize their unique potential. Following recent calls for decision-makers to recognize the importance of microbes in guiding action on climate change,15   our review highlights the need for similar consideration across the full range of our international sustainability agendas. To build a sustainable future on this planet, we must work with our oldest ancestors.
