                  The UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14 sets targets for nations to reduce marine pollution, ocean acidification, and sustainable use of coastal and ocean resources, which requires data on nutrient load, litter/plastics, pH, and biodiversity. Monitoring programs with large-scale and long-term data is an important source of environmental information and can play a crucial role in implementing the SDGs. This paper uses the Sea Water Quality Monitoring (SWQM), the coastal monitoring program of India, as a case study to examine the extent to which the monitoring program contributes to achieving the SDG 14 targets. The SWQM program is a multidisciplinary, long-term coastal monitoring program initiated by the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), Government of India, in 1990 to assess the coastal water quality. The paper highlights the interrelationships between the SWQM and SDG 14 targets (14.1.1, 14.2, 14.3, and 14.5) and discusses the challenges and opportunities of linking the national program to SDGs. Strengthening the program by increasing monitoring locations, sampling additional environmental parameters and biodiversity components, and using advanced scientific tools can be an efficient and pragmatic approach to SDG 14 implementation through the SWQM program. Aligning the long-term monitoring program and other research programs of a nation to the SDGs could provide potential co-benefits and more efficient utilization of funds.

Monitoring programs with large-scale and long-term data is an important source of environmental information and can play a crucial role in implementing the SDGs. This paper uses the Sea Water Quality Monitoring (SWQM), the coastal monitoring program of India, as a case study to examine the extent to which the monitoring program contributes to achieving the SDG 14 targets. The SWQM program is a multidisciplinary, long-term coastal monitoring program initiated by the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), Government of India, in 1990 to assess the coastal water quality. The paper highlights the interrelationships between the SWQM and SDG 14 targets (14.1.1, 14.2, 14.3, and 14.5) and discusses the challenges and opportunities of linking the national program to SDGs. Strengthening the program by increasing monitoring locations, sampling additional environmental parameters and biodiversity components, and using advanced scientific tools can be an efficient and pragmatic approach to SDG 14 implementation through the SWQM program. Aligning the long-term monitoring program and other research programs of a nation to the SDGs could provide potential co-benefits and more efficient utilization of funds.   Graphical abstract Image 1       Keywords COMAPS  Coast  India  MoES  Monitoring  SWQM  SDG14    1 Introduction Coastal areas with diverse resources are attractive environments for both human settlements and economic development. However, the rapid and unconstrained growth along the coasts has increased the human footprint on this complex and sensitive ecosystem. In September 2015, the United Nations General Assembly responded to tackle the complex challenges facing the planet by adopting 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) approaching the three pillars of sustainability (economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability). The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a commitment by the 193 Member States of the UN General Assembly to improve global sustainability by 2030. The Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14) aims to “conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development .” There is a growing body of publications on various aspects of the SDGs, including indicators and targets, synergies and trade-offs among the SDGs, synergies of SDG with other national and international agendas, and case studies of implementing the SDGs (e.g., Le Blanc 2015 ; Neumann et al., 2017 ; Fleming et al., 2017 ; Ntona and Morgera 2018 ; Rees et al., 2018 ; Major et al., 2018 ). In general, there is consensus that the current indicator framework of SDGs, with its broad set of indicators, impedes the straightforward assessment of synergies and trade-offs between the various indicators, targets, and goals, thus, enhancing the significance of policy guidance in achieving sustainable development (Rickels et al., 2016 ). Cormier and Elliott (2017)  concluded that if the targets are not SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-bounded), it is not only difficult for managers and stakeholders to know if the targets can and will be met, but also impossible to determine the effectiveness of the management plans. Therefore, the UN SDGs, although an ambitious step towards sustainable development, practical challenges remain. The literature on SDGs is devoted chiefly to SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 15 (Life on Land), while SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and SDG 14 (Life Below Water) were among the least researched (Salvia et al., 2019 ; Sweileh 2020 ). Of the 18,696 documents related to SDGs, only 652 (3.5%) were related to SDG 14, with countries such as the United States of America, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and Germany were the highest contributors. Further, only 80 of the 652 publications related to SDG 14 were from the Southeast Asian region (Sweileh 2020 ). Trade-offs between SDG 14 and other SDGs are discussed in many publications. Haward and Haas (2021)  argued that sufficient attention needs to be paid to social issues to achieve a sustainable ocean. For example, to achieve SDG Target 14. 4 (Table 1  ), there is a need to link SDG 14 with other social-related goals such as SDG 8 (Haward and Haas 2021 ). Neumann et al. (2017)  confirm the conflicts arising due to the linkages between the SDGs and the complexity of coastal issues and suggests the need for a coherent, integrated, and adapted coastal governance (Neumann et al., 2017 ). In the same study, Neumann et al. (2017)  observed that although the 2030 Agenda adopted the “three-pillar-model” approach (economic, social, and environment), it does not specify how to balance the three dimensions in cases of trade-offs, risks, uncertainty, or conflicts. However, since economic goals and social needs appear more urgent, the ecological aspect is often overlooked or trivialized. Therefore, the authors advocate a concept of strong sustainability for implementing SDG 14; however, the pitfalls of such a concept are also discussed (Neumann et al., 2017 ). The ocean is critically essential to our global economy; despite this, SDG 14 seems to stress more on environmental protection (Sachs 2015 ; Waage et al., 2015 ; Ntona and Morgera 2018 ). Implementation of SDG 14 can effectively contribute to SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 2 (Zero hunger), and SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) (Ntona and Morgera 2018 ).  2 SDGs implementation in India As a signatory to the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development and one of the fastest-growing economies globally, India is key to global SDG achievement. The Government of India has adopted a six-step strategy to achieve SDGs in India- (1) mapping of Ministries and ongoing, programs/schemes, (2) identification of National indicators, (3) consultations with stakeholders, (4) linking the national development agenda with SDGs, (5) meticulous implementation of schemes aligned with SDG targets and (6) rigorous outcome-based monitoring (NITI Aayog, 2018a,b ). To shed light on the research trends on SDGs in India, an analysis of scientific literature on SDG retrieved from the Web of Science Database was carried out. Based on the result of the bibliometric analysis, in India, SDG 3 (Good Health), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), and SDG 2 (Zero hunger) were the most researched topics (Fig. 1  ). Of the total 78 papers published on SDGs, 53 publications were directly related or linked to policies, interlinkage between SDGs, implementation, barriers, and other aspects of the SDGs, while 25 publications only mentioned the term SDG. SDG 14 was mentioned in only five studies. Marcinko et al. (2021)  used the modelling approach to understand the socio-ecological interactions among several SDGs, including SDG 14, in the Sundarban Biosphere Reserve. The novel integrated assessment modelling allowed analyzing the SDG interactions at a subnational scale and where and why trade-offs and synergies between SDG thematic sectors occur (Marcinko et al., 2021 ). Studies in Vembanad Lake emphasized that remote sensing observations (Kulk et al., 2021 ; Anas et al., 2021 ) and citizen science (Menon et al., 2021 ) in monitoring the lake could support SDG 3, SDG 6, and SDG 14. Lakshmi (2021)  reviewed the link between SDG 3 and SDG 14. In addition to research articles, reports are published related to various aspects of the SDGs (Technology and Action for Rural Advancement Technology and Action for Rural Advancement Report, 2015 ; RIS report, 2016 ; Voluntary National Report on the implementation of SDGs, 2017 ), including the progress reports by the NITI Aayog (SDG India Index & Dash Board, 2019; SDG India Index and Baseline Report, 2018 ). The National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) is the lead agency that oversees the implementation of SDGs in India. The literature review on Indian publications related to SDGs confirms the findings from other studies that SDG 14 is among the least researched SDGs (Salvia et al., 2019 ; Sweileh 2020 ). Indian experts in a survey-based study confirmed that SDG 1, SDG 13, and SDG 14 (11. 46% of the total vote) were among the low priority goals (Khalid et al., 2021 ). The low voting for SDG 1 and 13 was because India is on track to solve these issues (Khalid et al., 2021 ); however, it was unclear why the experts considered SDG 14 a low priority goal. Surprisingly, SDG 14 is among the least researched and low priority goals globally, even though it has critical environmental targets for the success of the other SDGs. Measures taken under the environmental targets in five SDGs (SDG 2, 6, 12, and 15) including SDG 14 will help maintain and restore natural resources that contribute directly to human well-being and development. A major challenge with implementing the SDGs is the gap between indicators and targets. One of the main reasons for this gap is the unavailability of measuring tools and data (Fukuda-Parr and McNeill, 2019 ). In addition, making progress in the Agenda requires effective follow-up and reviews regularly, which needs quality data and statistics to be available and comparable over time (Cázarez-Grageda and Zougbede 2019 ). Data inadequacy and gaps related to SDG indicators were among the top three concerns for the experts on implementing SDG in India (Khalid et al., 2021 ). The SDGs data gap and availability analysis indicate that SDG 14 and few other goals (SDG 1, 11, and 16) had complete data gaps or no data (Khalid et al., 2020 ). Experts recommended citizen science tools, private players, research institutions, and local universities for data collection. However, most of these suggestions were related to data collections for other SDGs (e.g., SDG 3). Yet another issue raised by the Indian experts was the limited budget and human resources for SDGs implementation. According to the UNESCAP report, the Indian government will have to spend 10% of its GDP to meet the SDGs, and diverting funds towards SDGs implementation can hamper several other existing schemes (UNESCAP 2019 ). The large and separate budgets required to implement the SDGs may not be currently available with central and several state governments (Khalid et al., 2021 ). Further, the human resources necessary for implementing the SDGs will require additional budget and infrastructure. Therefore, the authors recommended a comprehensive audit of government finances and human resources to identify the actual gap, which can help allocate the existing resources wisely. National programs designed for human development, long-term monitoring, and biodiversity conservation have large-scale and long-term data that can accelerate data availability and help close data gaps. Given this, India is integrating SDGs into its ongoing national and sub-national policies towards implementing the SDGs (Voluntary National Report on the implementation of SDGs, 2017 ). There are many national programs in operation to understand, manage, and sustainably use coastal and marine resources. These programs are carried out by 129 institutions, mainly supported by four Ministries of Government of India (RIS report, 2016 ). The Seawater Quality Monitoring (SWQM) implemented by the National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR), an attached office of the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), is one such program. The SWQM is a multidisciplinary, long-term program for assessing the coastal water quality and impacts of anthropogenic activities along the Indian coast. The mainstreaming of global policy frameworks into national strategies is not a novel concept; the UN Millennium Development Goals were also implemented based on this notion (sustainabledevelopment.un.org ). A few studies have explored the role of coastal monitoring for achieving the SDG 14 targets. Mao et al. (2019)  examined the institutional approach in China for its effectiveness in improving the water quality of rivers and coastal seas. The study recognized the insufficiencies in the current institutional arrangements (existing coordination among ministries, no uniform standard system for coastal water pollution control and, unclear property rights to discharge the pollutants) and proposed possible solutions based on a comparative study with the USA. Based on stakeholders’ perception and expert opinion, strategies on nine interrelated sectors, their objectives, and actions were outlined for the coastal and marine environment of Bangladesh (Islam and Shamsuddoha 2018 ). Few publications have also explored the links between SDG 14 and the achievement of other international agreements and policies, such as Aichi Target and Blue economy (Rees et al., 2018 ; Frades et al., 2020 ). As far as we are aware, a similar exercise has not yet been undertaken on the benefit of linking the national coastal monitoring program to SDG 14. In this context, scientifically monitoring coastal water quality is important for SDG 14 targets. In recognition of such importance of the monitoring program, the objective of this study is to examine how aligning the SWQM program to SDG 14 could contribute to achieve a sustainable ocean and deliver targets of SDG 14. To achieve the objectives, we reviewed the present SWQM program and how the program can be improved to fulfill India's commitment to the UN SDGs. The outline of this paper is as follows; Section 2  describes the history and accomplishments of the SWQM program, and Section 3  discusses the role of the SWQM program in achieving the targets of SDG 14. Section 3  also deliberates on the new approaches that need to be taken to maximize the contribution of SWQM to SDG 14. Section 4  briefly discusses the synergies between the marine research program and SDG 14. Finally, section 5  concludes the paper.  3 The SWQM program- history and achievements MoES (formerly Department of Ocean Development, Government of India) is responsible for conducting scientific and technical activities related to Earth System Science in the country. Understanding the interaction between the earth's different components and human systems at various spatial and temporal scales is an important function of the MoES. Coastal Ocean Monitoring and Prediction System program (COMAPS), the long-term coastal monitoring program, was initiated by the MoES in 1990. Monitoring was carried out at 70–83 coastal locations, and predictive models were developed for few locations (Subramanian 2011 ). The COMAPS program was renamed Seawater Quality Monitoring (SWQM) in 2012, and monitoring was restricted to 24 hotspots (Fig. 2  ). The National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR), formerly the Integrated Coastal and Marine Area Management Project Directorate (ICMAM PD), has coordinated the implementation of the SWQM program since 2012. The primary objective of the SWQM program is to assess the health of coastal waters through a monitoring network. The parameters analyzed under the SWQM are provided in Table 1 S. The SWQM program is implemented with the participation of national institutes and universities. The data received from the participating institutes are verified, validated, certified, and archived. Throughout its three decades, the SWQM program has generated large-scale and long-term data that seeks to improve the conservation and management of the Indian coastal system. These include data used by the Central and State Pollution Control Boards for decision making, developing oil spill trajectory modelling, sensitivity mapping and collection, development, and testing local hydrodynamic models. The SWQM program also contributed towards capacity building in terms of infrastructure development, training, and education (Madeswaran et al., 2018 ).  4 Role of SWQM in implementing the SDG 14 targets India is implementing the SDG with varying approaches, including linking various current national programs with the SDGs. The SDG 14 is being implemented in coordination with various ministries, institutes, academia, and other organizations. Table 1  presents the SDG targets, national indicators, and institutes/government bodies responsible for implementing the targets. This section discusses the link between the SWQM and SDG 14 targets and the coastal monitoring program's role in implementing the SDG 14 targets. 4.1 Target 14.1 (nutrient pollution and marine debris) Coastal eutrophication is a complex process caused by nutrient inputs from various sources. Nutrients in the coastal waters are due to the combined effect of terrestrial inputs (including agriculture, domestic effluents), atmospheric (e.g., industrial emissions), and natural processes (e.g., upwelling). Therefore, reducing the nutrient load to the coastal zones has become an important strategy in national and international policies. The target 14.1 of SDG 14 is to prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds (Table 1 ). The indicators include the index of coastal eutrophication (ICEP) (14.1.1a) and plastic debris density (14.1.1b). The data for 14.1 are classified into three levels, Level 1- Globally available data from earth observations and modelling; Level 2- National data, collected by countries (through the relevant Regional Seas Programme, where applicable) and; Level 3- Additional indicators, which are suggested that countries might consider collecting (UNEP, 2018 ). The parameters for eutrophication collected under the SWQM are given in Table 2  . Nitrogen and phosphorus are the primary inorganic nutrients responsible for the eutrophication of coastal and marine waters. Data on total nitrogen (NO2 , NO3 , NH4 ), dissolved inorganic phosphorus, and total silica in the surface waters of all the monitored locations of SWQM is available for >25 years (Fig. 1 ). The long-term data indicated that all the nutrients (NO2 , NO3 , NH4 , PO4 , and SiO4 ) showed an increase in most of the monitored locations; however, a significant increase was reported at few locations (Ramana Murthy et al., 2018 ). In addition to nutrients, the other parameters of SDG 14.1.1a are also collected (Tables 2 and 3  ). Since understanding eutrophication requires a thorough knowledge of the nutrient dynamics, the SWQM program will consider the following modifications in the nutrient studies to realize the target 14.1 - (1) expanding the spatial extent so that estuaries and rivers are well represented; (2) analysis of isotopic signatures to identify sources; (3) estimation of nutrient loads at selected hotspots. Such detailed studies will help identify sources and pathways of nutrients into the coastal waters that will help evaluate management options (Howarth et al., 2002 ; Mwaura et al., 2017 ). The target 14.1.1b is related to plastic pollution. The parameters for this target are plastic patches greater than 10 m and beach litter originating from land-based sources (Level 2). Level 2 parameters are beach litter, floating plastics, water column plastics, and seafloor litter. Microplastics (beach, seafloor, and surface water), ingestion by biota, entanglement, plastic pollution potential, river litter, other parameters related to plastic consumption and recycling, and health indicators (human health and ecosystem health) are categorized in Level 3. To reduce plastic pollution in the Indian coastal waters, NCCR has a research program to study the marine litter and microplastics in the coastal and estuarine habitats of India (Table 3 ). Studies are in progress for collecting samples for litter and plastics (macro, meso, and micro) from beaches and offshore areas (sediment, water, and biota). As plastic is a transboundary problem, international and regional cooperation is essential to reduce the entry of plastic litter and its redistribution within the world's oceans. In view of this, India is partnering with countries (e.g., United Kingdom, Norway, Japan, and Germany) to better understand the dynamics of plastics in the Indian Ocean and to develop a framework towards reduction of litter and plastic entering the marine system.  4.2 Target 14.2 (ecosystem-based approach) and 14.5 (conserve 10% of coastal and marine areas) Targets 14.2 and 14.5 require that the complexity and interspecies relationship within ecological systems be acknowledged to manage the human pressures impacting ecosystem services. Target 14.2 has two parameters- 1) “ICZM (Integrated Coastal Zone Management) plan boundary and implementation status and other area-based, integrated planning and management in place in waters under national jurisdiction, including exclusive economic zones (e.g., marine/maritime spatial planning, marine protected areas, marine zoning, sector-specific management plans) and 2) Ecological parameters (e.g., state of biodiversity, water quality, habitat quality, ecosystem health) which is considered Level 3. As mentioned in Table 2 , parameters for target 14.5 include the extent (zone) of protected areas, management effectiveness of protected areas, and connectivity. Conservation measures and management tools through ecosystem-based approach, integrated coastal zone management, Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) can help achieve these targets. These approaches are strongly shaped by the biodiversity of the area (species richness, distribution, and abundance), their relationship with the environmental conditions, and their changes. In this section, we briefly discuss the three management tools and how the biological monitoring of SWQM can contribute to achieving the target 14.2 and 14.5. 4.2.1 An ecosystem-based approach to conservation The ecosystem-based approach is the indicator for target 14.2, which states that “Proportion of national exclusive economic zones managed using ecosystem-based approaches ”. Traditionally, using a single ecosystem component approach to assessing the ecological status has been mostly unsuccessful in understanding the impact of human pressures on the ecosystem. Consequently, there has been a shift to ecosystem-based management for improving conventional monitoring and management practices. To implement an effective biodiversity conservation plan that considers all the taxa within the region, actions require being practical yet science-based planning framework. The ecosystem-based approach accepted by the Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and SDGs is “a strategy for the integrated management of land, water and living resources that promotes conservation and sustainable use in an equitable way. It is based on the application of appropriate scientific methodologies focused on levels of biological organization that encompasses the processes, functions, and interactions among organisms and their environment. It recognizes that humans, with their cultural diversity, are an integral part of ecosystems ”. The ecosystem-based approach is the central theme in the marine monitoring program of Baltic Sea, North-East Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea, and the Black Sea (e.g., The Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission (HELCOM), Commission for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR) and Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) of European Union). The importance and benefits of an ecosystem-based approach in monitoring programs have been extensively discussed (e.g., Szaro et al., 1998 ; Borja et al., 2009 ; Curtin and Prellezo, 2010 ; Katsanevakis et al., 2011 ; Kupschus et al., 2016 ). Assessment based on physical and chemical variables, which was the focus of the SWQM program, though being comparatively inexpensive and simpler to link to anthropogenic stressors, cannot reflect the holistic impact on the ecosystem processes. The full range of ecosystems, biodiversity, ecological processes, and environmental gradients must be considered for the monitoring program to be ecologically effective. Thus, dedicated effort to analyze the ecosystem process is a prerequisite for successfully implementing monitoring objectives. Impact assessment studies (EIA and Strategic Environmental Assessment) are key tools for mainstreaming biodiversity considerations into planning and development (e.g., Treweek, 1996 ; Slootweg et al., 2006 ). The CBD has identified impact assessment as an important tool for ensuring that biodiversity conservation and sustainable use are pursued as fundamental objectives of strategic decision-making and planning. The CBD has provided voluntary guidelines for better integrating biodiversity-related considerations into the EIA process (UNEP/CBD/COP/11/23 2012) . Currently, the SWQM program monitors the plankton and benthic components, and, in the future, the other biological components will also be considered. In addition, there are plans to conduct a pilot study on the ecosystem-based approach to monitoring. Based on the outcome of the pilot studies, this approach could be extended to the other monitoring locations.  4.2.2 Integrated marine area management Targets 14.2 and 14.5 emphasize protecting the coastal and marine biodiversity and natural resources through protected areas. Before the SDG, in 2004, the Convention of Parties (COP) to the CBD agreed that “marine and coastal protected areas are essential tools and approaches in the conservation and sustainable use of marine and coastal biodiversity” in achieving the “effective conservation of at least 10% of each of the world's ecological regions” (UNEP/CBD/COP/DEC/VII/5 2004 ). In 2010, COP to the CBD adopted the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020, including the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. Aichi Target 11 specifically states that ‘by 2020 at least 17 percent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10% of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, to be conserved through effective, ecologically representative and well-connected systems of protected areas and other area-based conservation measures ’ (UNEP/CBD/COP/10/27/Annex 2010) . SDG 14 (target 14.5) reaffirms the Aichi target 11 of conserving at least 10% of coastal and marine areas. Therefore, to successfully implement the targets of SDG it is important to integrate related SDG targets and also with other relevant instruments, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity's (CBD) Aichi Biodiversity Targets (Diz et al., 2018 ). In the thirteenth meeting of the COP in 2016, the parties were urged to mainstream biodiversity and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets when implementing the SDGs. Like most countries, India has developed 12 national biodiversity targets in line with Aichi targets. In coordination with other ministries and institutes, the Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change (MoEF & CC) is part of the national campaign to raise awareness about biodiversity and understand the biodiversity-ecosystem services relationship for its conservation (Table 1 ).  4.2.3 Marine protected areas (MPA) Towards achieving the biodiversity targets, India has identified 24 Marine Protected Areas (MPA) in the mainland (8214 km2 ), accounting for about 5% of the total Protected Area (PA). The Andaman and Nicobar Islands have about 105 PA accounting for 40% (1510 km2 ) of its coastal habitat. On the other hand, Lakshadweep Island has only one PA covering an area of 0.01 km2 . In addition, 106 coastal and marine sites have been identified and prioritized as Important Coastal and Marine Biodiversity Areas (ICMBAs). With 29% of the total geographical area under biodiversity conservation, India has exceeded the global Aichi Target of 17% (MoEFF & CC, 2019 ). One of the parameters for monitoring the target 14.5 is the management effectiveness of protected areas (Table 2 ). There is a large amount of literature documenting that ineffective management remains one of the major problems in the MPA (Redpath et al., 2013 ; Le Blanc et al., 2017 ; Rechciński et al., 2019 ). Further, protected areas that severely restrict any human activities have often become the reasons for socio-economic conflicts (Samuel et al., 2012 ; Redpath et al., 2013 ; Asha et al., 2015 ; Rechciński et al., 2019 ). On the other hand, unregulated activities in MPA have resulted in the degradation of the ecosystem (Samuel et al., 2012 ; De et al., 2020 ). Since the SDG targets between marine conservation (14.2 and 14.5) and economic development (14.7) are interlinked, poorly managed MPA can impact the economic and social structures (Le Blanc et al., 2017 ). It is difficult for India to designate more habitats into the MPA due to the prevailing socio-economic perspective (Sivakumar et al., 2013 ); it is, therefore, crucial that India effectively manage its MPA. Because the seas are highly connected, management of MPA will require assessing the quality of the adjacent coastal habitat. On the other hand, MPAs can provide “natural baselines”, against which coastal systems impacted by disturbances can be compared and assessed (Carr et al., 2011 ). At present, SWQM is monitoring eight sites in the Andaman and Nicobar Island, which has 40% of its area designated as MPA. Since the number of sampling locations will be increased to ∼50, which will include locations adjacent to MPA, the evaluations and management of such sites will significantly benefit from the coastal monitoring program.  4.2.4 Biodiversity monitoring for marine conservation and management Although it is estimated that 2.2 million species live in the oceans, it is believed that 91% of those in the oceans have not yet been described (Mora et al., 2011 ). Therefore, the lack of sufficient data on relative levels of biodiversity and human impact remains a major bottleneck in marine conservation. Marine biodiversity database and updated checklist are lacking for most marine groups of India and the available database is mainly focused on a few commercial species (Venkataraman and Wafar, 2005 ; Sivadas and Carvalho, 2020 ). Also, there has been no systematic assessment of the conservation status of coastal and marine species of India using the IUCN Regional Red Listing Guidelines (Sivakumar et al., 2013 ). As a result of the biodiversity data gaps, studies on marine ecology are often based on incomplete data, leading to biased interpretation. Consequently, advancing the discovery and expanding marine biodiversity knowledge can help to improve understanding of biodiversity distributions patterns. Biological monitoring is a critical part of the ongoing SWQM program. The program currently relies on the traditional method of collection and identification of specific groups of marine organisms (phytoplankton, zooplankton, and macrobenthos). However, errors in species identification are an issue, a trend observed in most ecological, monitoring, and EIA studies (Bortolus 2008 ; Sivadas and Madeswaran 2020 ). One of the major reasons for poor taxonomy in the country is the lack of taxonomists for most biodiversity groups, especially marine invertebrates (Dar et al., 2012 ; Sivadas and Madeswaran 2020 ). According to Bourlat et al. (2013) , an ideal monitoring program should consider all the taxa, from viruses to mammals and their life stages. Recent advances in genomic techniques provide complementary information on biodiversity and yield faster and more reliable taxonomic data, particularly in marine invertebrates and microbiology. The advantages of genomic techniques for monitoring have been discussed by various authors (Stewart et al., 2008 ; Bourlat et al., 2013 ; Ininbergs et al., 2015 ). Environmental DNA (e DNA) and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) metabarcoding are emerging as an important tool for monitoring coastal biodiversity (e.g., Stat et al., 2017 ; DiBattista et al., 2020 ). The eDNA studies have been initiated under the SWQM program (Garlapati et al., 2021 ); however, standardization and optimization need to be carried out before its applications into the routine monitoring of the coastal waters of India. In addition, the SWQM program will improve biodiversity studies by providing training, developing databases, and updating monographs. Modelling techniques have also been applied to improve the understanding of biodiversity distributions and biotic-environmental relationships. An example is the species distribution models that fill the data gaps and allow to relate the biotic and environmental variables (Guisan and Thuiller 2005 ; Martinez-Meyer 2005 ; Franklin 2009 ), which helps to identify the species preferred range for each predictive variable. Modelling approaches also allow looking at seasonality patterns of species to identify areas where species congregate, simulate ecological processes and systems over longer periods, forecast future trends, and test different scenarios. The Ecosystem Modelling program of NCCR uses the modelling approach to understand the ecosystem processes at selected habitats. The project was successfully implemented for semi-enclosed water bodies (Chilika lagoon, Cochin backwaters, and Sunderbans) and open coast shelf waters (Southwest coast) (Panda et al., 2013 , 2015 ; Kankara and Panda 2020 ).   4.3 Target 14.3 (ocean acidification) The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC-UNESCO) is the custodian agency for the SDG 14.3.1 indicator. The IOC coordinated with the International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange Programme, the International Ocean Acidification experts (including data managers), and the Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network (GOA-ON) for providing the technical support to develop the methodology for SDG Indicator 14.3.1. The four measurable parameters identified to measure the variability in ocean acidity are, pH (the concentration of hydrogen ions on a logarithmic scale), CT (total dissolved inorganic carbon), p CO2 (carbon dioxide partial pressure), and AT (total alkalinity) (IOC/EC-LI/2,  Annex 6 rev). Long-term monitoring locations are ideal for ocean acidification observation as these sites provide biogeochemical variability of the system and include information on nutrient concentrations, temperature, salinity, and, occasionally, carbonate chemistry (IOC/EC-LI/2,  Annex 6 rev). Moreover, historical data is important as it allows to measure the rate of change and to compare natural variability and anthropogenic alterations. In this context, the SWQM has been collecting data for surface water pH. Additional data such as depth, temperature, salinity, nutrients, and suspended solids are also available. Monitoring seawater pH and p CO2 has become a priority due to its rapid variability, subsequently affecting the biological community and biogeochemical process. Because of the importance of these parameters, in addition to the parameters mentioned above, data for p CO2 and Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) will be generated under the SWQM program.   5 Complementing monitoring data with marine research programs There is still a demand for better information on the status and trends in the coastal system to improve the efficacy of the existing programs, guide management and regulator decisions, and help shape global and national policy. Most national monitoring programs across the globe were initiated several decades ago. Therefore, many of the environmental challenges we face today including multiple anthropogenic stressors, climate change, and extreme weather events were not explicitly included in most monitoring programs. Given the current challenges faced by the earth's ecosystem, it is necessary to include this aspect in the monitoring program. Although SWQM monitors the coastal waters, it measured basic parameters and had limited spatial coverage. Hence to support the SDG 14 targets, along with modification of the SWQM program (as discussed above), the monitoring programs must be supported by other marine research programs for a better understanding the functioning of coastal ecosystem. For example, the long-term program in specialized habitats can provide a detailed ecosystem understanding of that habitat. Other promising sources of information are projects that collect high-frequency ecological data using autonomous sensors. Various marine institutes of India, including NCCR has a research program that is presently collecting ecological data, including higher frequency measurements using autonomous sensors at multiple sites along the Indian coast (Table 3 ). However, one major limitation to comparing data from different studies is the differences in the methodology employed. Especially for a long-term monitoring program wherein maintaining consistency in survey protocols through time is a challenge due to various reasons including cost and rapidly changing tools and technology used. This type of challenge can be overcome by developing standardized protocols. Linking the monitoring program with other research programs will complement the monitoring data and facilitate the exploration of new questions and research relevant to the complex changes in the coastal system without necessitating new data collection. Networking will also help to avoid research overlapping and standardize protocols making data comparable. Linking long-term monitoring programs and major research projects of a region to the SDGs (and Aichi Target 11) has important advantages for coastal management. By making the indicators and related parameters of SDGs clear, the funding agencies can choose programs that align with the SDGs, thus providing potential co-benefits and more efficient funding efforts. Therefore, linking global, regional, and national programs to SDGs will be crucial to overcoming the resource constraints that currently restrict the capacity of several nations, including India, to deliver the required information for implementing SDGs.  6 Conclusion The SDG-related literature published in peer-review journals has multiplied globally and in India. However, SDG 14 was one of the least researched goals in India and globally. Further, the survey-based studies on SDGs in India identified data gaps and limited resources as a major constraint for implementing the goals. The present study is the first report on the implementation of SDG 14 by linking it to the national coastal monitoring program, SWQM. This study shows that the SWQM could contribute to realizing coastal water monitoring required by SDG 14. Therefore, over 30 years after its implementation, the SWQM program remains more relevant than ever. The targets 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, and 14.5 of SDG 14 require information on the current health status of the coastal region which is being generated under the SWQM program. The SWQM program has crucial long-term data on nutrients, pH, and coastal water quality index required for developing the SDG Index for SDG 14. The study identified areas in the SWQM program that needed to be strengthened and proposed possible solutions. As the SWQM program will continue with modifications using new tools and technology, it will significantly contribute to achieving the SDG 14 targets. Further, other national marine research programs, including the NCCR projects, will provide additional data to improve the management of coastal ecosystems and implement the global commitment through SDGs and Aichi targets. Given the notable synergies between the SDG 14, Aichi Target 11, and the SWQM objectives, India's coastal monitoring program will significantly contribute to achieving the specific SDG 14 targets and strengthen the national effort for marine conservation and the global vision of environmental sustainability. This approach can be used as a template for other SDGs. Linking national programs to SDG will help nations, particularly developing countries, successfully move forward to achieve the targets and efficiently channelize the limited resources (e.g., funding, infrastructure, and experts).
