                  Purpose
                  To assess the relevance of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework for adolescent health measurement, both in terms of age disaggregation and different health domains captured, and how the adolescent health indicators recommended by the Global Action for Measurement of Adolescent Health (GAMA) can complement the SDG framework.
               
                  Methods
                  We conducted a desk review to systematically map all 248 SDG indicators using the UN metadata repository in three steps: 1) age-related mandates for SDG reporting; 2) linkages between the SDG indicators and priority areas for adolescent health measurement; 3) comparison between the GAMA indicators and the SDG framework.
               
                  Results
                  Of the 248 SDG indicators, 35 (14%) targeted an age range overlapping with adolescence (10–19 years) and 33 (13%) called for age disaggregation. Only one indicator (3.7.2 “adolescent birth rate”) covered the entire 10–19 age range. Almost half (41%) of the SDG indicators were directly related to adolescent health, but only 33 of those (13% of all SDG indicators) overlapped with the ages 10–19, and 15 (6% of all SDG indicators) explicitly mandated age disaggregation. Among the 47 GAMA indicators, five corresponded to existing SDG indicators, and eight were adolescent-specific age adaptations. Several GAMA indicators shed light on aspects not tracked in the SDG framework, such as obesity, mental health, physical activity, and bullying among 10–19-year-olds.
               
                  Discussion
                  Adolescent health cannot be monitored comprehensively with the SDG framework alone. The GAMA indicators complement this framework via age-disaggregated adaptations and by tracking aspects of adolescent health currently absent from the SDGs.

Figure 2 Age coverage across relevant SDG indicators. This figure presents the specific age ranges of the 35 population-based SDG indicators defined for an age group overlapping with the adolescent period (10–19 years). The ordering of each line presents the relative frequency with which the age range occurred (least common = bottom of figure; most common = top of figure).    Figure 3 Distribution of 101 directly related SDG indicators across adolescent health measurement domains. This figure presents the frequency of SDG indicators classified as directly related to an adolescent health measurement area. The main matrix displays the frequency of these indicators within specific SDGs and specific health measurement domains. The row at the top of the figure displays the frequency of such indicators across all measurement domains, while the column on the left-hand side of the figure displays the frequencies across all SDGs.    Figure 4 Proportion of non-population-based and population-based SDG indicators classified as directly, closely, or remotely related to adolescent health measurement. Among the 76 population-based SDG indicators classified as directly related to a priority area, 33 also targeted an age range overlapping with 10–19 years, and 15 further mandated disaggregation by age.

Department of Global Public Health Tomtebodavägen 18A Stockholm 17177 Sweden      Purpose To assess the relevance of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework for adolescent health measurement, both in terms of age disaggregation and different health domains captured, and how the adolescent health indicators recommended by the Global Action for Measurement of Adolescent Health (GAMA) can complement the SDG framework.  Methods We conducted a desk review to systematically map all 248 SDG indicators using the UN metadata repository in three steps: 1) age-related mandates for SDG reporting; 2) linkages between the SDG indicators and priority areas for adolescent health measurement; 3) comparison between the GAMA indicators and the SDG framework.  Results Of the 248 SDG indicators, 35 (14%) targeted an age range overlapping with adolescence (10–19 years) and 33 (13%) called for age disaggregation. Only one indicator (3.7.2 “adolescent birth rate”) covered the entire 10–19 age range. Almost half (41%) of the SDG indicators were directly related to adolescent health, but only 33 of those (13% of all SDG indicators) overlapped with the ages 10–19, and 15 (6% of all SDG indicators) explicitly mandated age disaggregation. Among the 47 GAMA indicators, five corresponded to existing SDG indicators, and eight were adolescent-specific age adaptations. Several GAMA indicators shed light on aspects not tracked in the SDG framework, such as obesity, mental health, physical activity, and bullying among 10–19-year-olds.  Discussion Adolescent health cannot be monitored comprehensively with the SDG framework alone. The GAMA indicators complement this framework via age-disaggregated adaptations and by tracking aspects of adolescent health currently absent from the SDGs.   Keywords Adolescence  Adolescent health  Youth health  Sustainable development goals  Global health  Health status indicators  Measurement    Implications and Contribution  The Sustainable Development Goal framework is insufficient to monitor adolescent health comprehensively. Drawing on the Global Action for Measurement of Adolescent Health adolescent health indicators, this paper proposes additional disaggregation and priority measurement areas to better understand adolescent health profiles, inform policy, and prioritize investment.      Adolescence (10–19 years) is a critical period to lay the foundation for sustainable and healthy futures [1 ]. Investing in adolescent health and well-being brings a “triple dividend” of benefits: improving the health of young people now, promoting healthier trajectories throughout the life course, and enhancing the prospects of future generations [2 ]. The world's 1.3 billion adolescents are growing up in a period of rapid epidemiological shifts and widening inequities [3 ]. Understanding and tracking the health and development of adolescents thus requires special attention in global development goals, strategies, and monitoring frameworks. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a global set of 17 goals adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015 [4 ]. The SDG measurement framework divides each goal into a set of targets and measures progress toward each target using one or more indicators. Despite the framework's aim to “leave no one behind,” recent studies suggest that it lacks age- and sex-disaggregated details [5 ,6 ]. According to the UN Children's Fund, only 35 (14%) of the 248 SDG indicators directly concern children aged 0–18 years [7 ], but a similar mapping has not been done for adolescents specifically. A recent scoping review identified substantial gaps in adolescent health indicators across different measurement initiatives, including the SDG framework [8 ]. Important aspects of adolescent health, such as system performance and interventions, policies, programs, and laws were not adequately captured by these measurement initiatives [8 ]. Where measurement was more advanced, such as in the field of sexual and reproductive health and rights, indicators were found to be derived from those originally developed for other age groups or to lack sufficient age disaggregation [8 ]. As highlighted in the latest World Youth Report, these data gaps are among the most serious obstacles to meeting young people's needs under the 2030 Agenda [9 ]. To harmonize measurement and improve accountability for adolescent health, the World Health Organization (WHO), in collaboration with UN H6+ partner agencies (Joint UN Program on HIV/AIDS, UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UN Population Fund, UNICEF, UN Women, the World Bank Group, and the World Food Program) established the Global Action for Measurement of Adolescent Health (GAMA) Advisory Group in 2018 [10 ]. Following a structured process with input from a broad range of stakeholders, GAMA has identified a list of 47 indicators measuring the most important health issues for adolescents [11 ,12 ]. The indicators recommended by GAMA (henceforth, “GAMA indicators”) have been assessed for feasibility in different countries covering all WHO regions [13 ]. While the SDGs were considered throughout the development and refinement of the GAMA indicators, the extent to which both frameworks complement each other has not yet been investigated. As we have reached the halfway mark on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, there is a need to re-examine adolescents' position within the current SDGs and reflect on how to better track their health post-2030. This study aimed to assess the relevance of the SDG framework for adolescent health, both in terms of age disaggregation and the different health domains captured, and to further determine how the GAMA indicators can complement the SDG framework. We focused on two research questions:1. How well do the current SDG indicators capture different aspects of adolescent health?  2. How do the GAMA adolescent health indicators map across and complement the SDG framework?    Methods Study design We conducted a systematic mapping of the SDG framework and the GAMA adolescent health indicators in three steps. In the first two steps, we conducted a desk review of the 248 SDG indicators using the UN metadata repository [14 ]: 1) to map the age-related mandates for SDG reporting, and 2) to assess the linkages between the SDG indicators and priority areas for adolescent health measurement [15 ]. In the third step, we compared the 47 GAMA indicators with the SDG framework. An overview of the three steps is provided in Figure 1  .  Step 1: Mapping the age-related mandates for SDG reporting An initial review of the SDG indicator metadata repository [14 ] mapped age-related criteria for SDG reporting. First, we determined whether the indicator was population-based, excluding all other indicators from the remainder of this step. Second, we reviewed the specific age range of the indicator. In this process, we assessed whether the age range overlapped partially or completely with the adolescent period (10–19 years). Third, we examined the age-disaggregation mandate provided in the indicator metadata. While age disaggregation was often listed as a recommended criterion for SDG reporting, the degree of precision and clarity of the language used in the metadata varied greatly across indicators. For this desk review, we classified the importance placed on age disaggregation using three categories: as integral , desirable,  or absent  from the indicator reporting guidelines. Box 1   provides a description of each category.  Step 2: Assessing the linkages between the SDGs and adolescent health measurement Next, we assessed the relevance of the SDG framework in capturing priority areas for adolescent health measurement. We adopted a deliberately broad understanding of adolescent health based on an existing framework elaborated by GAMA, organized under six domains: 1) policies/programs/laws; 2) systems performance and interventions; 3) health determinants; 4) health behaviors/risks; 5) subjective well-being; 6) health outcomes/conditions [15 ]. A complete list of the priority areas used for this desk review is provided in Appendix A . We categorized each of the 248 SDG indicators, population-based and non-population-based alike, as directly , closely,  or remotely related  to one or more priority areas for adolescent health measurement (Figure 1 ). Indicators related to multiple priority areas were listed in the area of the indicator's primary focus and cross-listed in the other relevant areas. To be classified as directly related  to a priority area, an indicator had to include a summary measure of an outcome of interest. For example, SDG 1.2.1, “Proportion of population living below the national poverty line” includes a summary measure of poverty and is thus considered directly related  to the priority area “income level and poverty.” To be considered closely related , indicators had to measure a proximate outcome or a clear determinant of an outcome of interest. For example, SDG 1.b.1 “Pro-poor public social spending” measures a clear determinant of poverty, as pro-poor public social spending was explicitly aimed at poverty reduction in the rationale section of the metadata. The indicator was thus classified as closely related  to the priority area “income level and poverty.” If an indicator presented a direct relationship to one area and a close relationship to another area, the indicator was classified as directly related  to adolescent health measurement (i.e., there was no overlap between the directly related  and closely related  categories). We considered the remaining SDG indicators, which were neither directly  nor closely related  to a priority area, as remotely related  to adolescent health measurement.  Step 3: Comparing the GAMA indicators with the SDG framework Finally, we mapped the 47 GAMA indicators [11 ] across the SDG framework. We determined whether a GAMA indicator: 1) corresponded to an existing SDG indicator; 2) was an adolescent-specific age adaptation; or 3) supported achievement of an SDG even if absent from the official monitoring framework. As part of the selection process of the GAMA indicators, the SDG framework was included as one of several measurement initiatives used as a basis for the final set of indicators [8 ,11 ]. The first mapping category thus included the GAMA indicators that corresponded to existing SDG indicators. If a GAMA indicator included the same summary measure as an SDG indicator but targeted a different age range or mandated further age disaggregation than what was specified in the original metadata, it was categorized as being an adolescent-specific age adaptation. For the GAMA indicators that neither corresponded to nor adapted an existing SDG indicator, an in-depth review was carried out to assess potential linkages to one or several SDG target(s), goal(s), or the SDG framework as a whole. These linkages were established with the aim of exploring the complementarity of the GAMA indicators in highlighting aspects of adolescent health that, despite not being tracked in the monitoring framework, are pertinent to achieve progress across the SDGs.   Results Relevance and gaps of the SDG framework in relation to adolescent health measurement Visibility of the adolescent period We classified 107 indicators out of 248 (43%) as population-based. Thirty-five indicators (33% of population-based indicators; 14% of all SDG indicators) targeted an age range overlapping with 10–19 years. As shown in Figure 2  , these age ranges did not cover the entire adolescent period and included other age groups. The most frequently occurring age range targeted those aged 15 and above (N = 12), excluding younger adolescents aged 10–14 years while also including the entire adult population. Only one indicator, SDG 3.7.2 “Adolescent birth rate,” covered the entire 10–19 age range.  Age-disaggregation mandates Whether or not the indicator overlapped with the adolescent period, age disaggregation was integral  to the reporting process of 33 SDG indicators (31% of the population-based indicators; 13% of all SDG indicators). These indicators explicitly mandated disaggregation by age by either including age in the indicator name or listing age as an available disaggregation criterion in the metadata. Age disaggregation was desirable  for the reporting of 32 indicators (29% of the population-based indicators; 13% of all SDG indicators), in consideration of data availability at the country level. The remaining 44 population-based indicators did not mandate age disaggregation as part of the reporting process. Of the 35 SDG indicators defined for an age range overlapping with 10–19 years, 15 (14% of the population-based indicators; 6% of all SDG indicators) also mandated age disaggregation as integral  to the SDG reporting process. These indicators related to SDG 5 (gender equality, N = 5), SDG 4 (quality education, N = 4), SDG 8 (decent work, N = 3), SDG 3 (good health and well-being, N = 2), and SDG 10 (reduced inequalities, N = 1).  Linkages to priority areas for adolescent health measurement Out of the 248 SDG indicators, 101 (41%) were directly related  to at least one of the priority areas for adolescent health measurement. An additional 83 SDG indicators (33%) were closely related  to one or several of the priority areas. The remaining 64 indicators (26%) were remotely related  to adolescent health measurement. As shown in Figure 3  , the distribution of directly related  indicators varied greatly across SDGs and health measurement domains. Almost half (N = 48, 48%) of these indicators fell within three goals: SDG 3 (good health and well-being, N = 19), SDG 16 (peace and justice, N = 18), and SDG 5 (gender equality, N = 11). In terms of adolescent health measurement domains, the vast majority (N = 83, 82%) were linked to Domain 3 (health determinants, N = 46) and Domain 6 (health outcomes and conditions, N = 37). By contrast, none of the indicators classified as directly related  to adolescent health measurement were linked to either Domain 1 (policies/programs/laws) or Domain 5 (subjective well-being). When combining these linkages with the age criteria, 33 SDG indicators (31% of population-based indicators; 13% of all SDG indicators) were found to target an age group overlapping with 10–19 years and to be directly related  to at least one priority area for adolescent health measurement. Further consideration of the closely related  indicators marginally changed this result: 34 indicators across the entire SDG framework targeted an age range overlapping with the adolescent period and directly  or closely related  to at least one priority area. As shown in Figure 4  , only 15 indicators (14% of the population-based indicators and 6% of all SDG indicators) met all three mapping criteria (overlapping age range, integral  age disaggregation, and directly related ). These indicators were distributed across five SDGs: SDG 5 (gender equality, N = 5), SDG 4 (quality education, N = 4), SDG 8 (decent work, N = 3), SDG 3 (good health and well-being, N = 2), and SDG 10 (reduced inequalities, N = 1). They further related to three adolescent health measurement domains: Domain 3 (health determinants, N = 9), Domain 6 (health outcomes and conditions, N = 5), and Domain 4 (health behaviors, N = 1). A complete list of SDG indicators satisfying all three mapping criteria is provided in Appendix B .   Complementarity of the GAMA indicators to track progress across the SDGs Corresponding GAMA indicators and adolescent-specific age adaptations Among the 47 GAMA indicators, five corresponded to existing SDG indicators, and eight were adolescent-specific age adaptations. The adaptations related to both the targeted age range and age disaggregation. Of the eight GAMA indicators that were adaptations, five were defined for the entire adolescent age range (10–19 years) and three for older adolescents (15–19 years). The SDG indicators from which they were adapted targeted different age groups, including the total population (N = 3), women aged 15–49 years (N = 3), youth aged 15–24 years (N = 1), and youth and adults aged 15+ years (N = 1). Moreover, all GAMA indicators defined for the 10–19 year age range explicitly mandated age disaggregation by younger and older adolescents, ages 10–14 and 15–19 years, respectively. By contrast, the SDG indicators from which they were adapted did not consistently mandate age disaggregation as part of the reporting process; age disaggregation was considered integral  to the reporting of three SDG indicators, desirable  for six other SDG indicators, and absent  from the reporting guidelines of the remaining indicator.  Complementary GAMA indicators Thirty-four of the GAMA indicators were found to complement the SDGs by shedding light on aspects of adolescent health not tracked within the monitoring framework. As shown in Table 1  , 26 of these related to SDG 3 (good health and well-being), six to SDG 2 (zero hunger), two to SDG 5 (gender equality), one to SDG 4 (quality education), and one to SDG 16 (peace and justice). To note, three GAMA indicators were complementary across several goals (two across SDGs 3 and 5, one across SDGs 3 and 4), and one complemented the overall SDG framework. For example, while obesity is a rising global health concern, particularly among adolescents [5 ], progress towards SDG 2 (improved nutrition) currently emphasizes indicators of undernutrition. The GAMA indicator “prevalence of overweight and obesity among adolescents” was thus found to contribute to enhanced monitoring of progress toward SDG 2. Similarly, there was no SDG indicator to monitor important aspects of preventing noncommunicable diseases and promoting mental health and well-being (SDG target 3.4), including health behaviors and risks such as physical activity, as well as prevalence of anxiety and depression among adolescents. The GAMA indicators were found to address this gap by capturing the proportion of adolescents who “accumulated an average of at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity daily during the past 7 days” and “reported symptoms of depression and/or anxiety.” Other examples of complementary GAMA indicators included premenstruation menarche awareness, which can contribute to the tracking of SDG target 5.6 on universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights, and prevalence of bullying, which can support the monitoring of SDG target 16.1 on interpersonal violence.    Discussion This systematic mapping reveals substantial gaps in the SDG framework in relation to adolescent health measurement, both in terms of age disaggregation and health domains captured. The findings further indicate the potential of the GAMA indicators [12 ] to complement the existing SDG framework and contribute toward more comprehensive monitoring of adolescent health post-2030. Our desk review of the SDG indicator metadata [14 ] confirms the framework's lack of granularity on age differences. Most indicators overlapping with 10–19 years also encompassed years well beyond the adolescent period. Out of 35 SDG indicators targeting an age range overlapping with adolescence (10–19 years), 19 indicators also included adults aged 20 years and older, and six focused on women of reproductive age (15–49 years). The lack of indicators specifically focusing on adolescence aligns with the findings from a previous scoping review on adolescent health measurement [8 ]. Our mapping further indicates the invisibility of younger adolescents aged 10–14 years, a group disproportionately neglected across programming and measurement efforts [5 ,6 ,8 ]. Aside from one notable exception specifically targeting the entire adolescent period, SDG indicator 3.7.2 “adolescent birth rate,” the few indicators including this age range were defined for children and adolescents aged 0–18 years. The absence of adolescent-specific indicators and robust data has implications for developing policies that address adolescents' priorities. Without such data, policymakers are likely to have a partial or inaccurate view of the situation of adolescents, hindering the development of targeted, age-specific policies and risking diverting scarce resources from meeting the needs of adolescents. We further found a substantial lack of consistent mandate for age disaggregation of the SDG indicators across the UN metadata. Age-disaggregated data make it possible to measure and monitor investments in adolescents in areas of the SDG framework that make no specific reference to adolescence and are thus essential to deliver on the promise to “leave no one behind.” However, disaggregation by age was explicitly mandated in the metadata of only 33 SDG indicators (31% of the population-based indicators; 13% of all SDG indicators). Of these, 15 indicators (14% of the population-based indicators; 6% of all SDG indicators) targeted an age range overlapping with 10–19 years. While age-disaggregation is important across all age groups, lacking age-disaggregated indicators for 10–19-year-olds is especially troubling given the vast physical, cognitive, social, and sexual transitions that adolescents experience [5 ,6 ]. In addition, the level of detail provided in the metadata was not consistent across all SDG indicators. For example, even when age disaggregation was recommended as part of the SDG reporting process, age-disaggregation units were not always specified. Without clear reporting guidelines, it is unlikely that data generated at the country level will be disaggregated in a harmonized manner, hampering comparability and prioritization of investment. Using standardized age bands for younger adolescents aged 10–14 years and older adolescents aged 15–19 years, as suggested by Diaz et al. [16 ], is one promising way to address this issue. Such age bands enable meaningful data collection and analysis on age differences while also minimizing countries' reporting burden, thus facilitating harmonization, comparability, and usefulness of health data globally. There are also clear gaps in the different adolescent health domains captured by the SDG framework. In our review, most SDG indicators classified as directly related  to adolescent health measurement were linked to either health determinants or health outcomes and conditions. On the other hand, a clear mismatch was found between the SDGs and two out of six domains of adolescent health measurement [15 ], namely policies, programs and laws, and subjective well-being. The absence of policy-focused indicators reflects the larger landscape of adolescent health measurement, where indicator development in the field of policy generally lags behind [8 ]. In addition, the lack of indicators related to subjective well-being echoes a common criticism regarding the SDGs' reductionist framing of health as the absence of disease, with a disproportionate focus on alleviating disease burdens as opposed to promoting health and well-being more broadly [17 ]. Notably, while the SDG target 3.4 explicitly mentions “mental health and well-being,” the only indicator included to track mental health is suicide mortality rate. As another example, while adolescents are greatly affected by environmental challenges and leaders in addressing climate change, almost none of the SDG indicators included under key environmental goals such as SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 15 (life on land) were found to directly relate to adolescent health. These omissions have important implications for monitoring and prioritization of investments. This mismatch suggests that, even if progress against the SDG indicators is achieved and adequately monitored, the considerable investments supporting these efforts may not be well allocated. Exploring synergies across other measurement initiatives is crucial to ensure that adolescents' needs are prioritized and comprehensively tracked. The GAMA indicators can help address the gaps identified in the SDG framework, both in terms of age disaggregation and health domains captured. First, the GAMA indicators supplement the SDG indicators' lack of age disaggregated details by mandating standardized age bands for 10–14 years and 15–19 years. Such age bands shed light on the distinct experiences of younger versus older adolescents, providing a more comprehensive picture of adolescents' developmental stages and situations. Second, the GAMA indicators call attention to other aspects of adolescent health that, despite being absent from the SDG monitoring framework, contribute toward achievement of the goals. The GAMA indicators related to obesity and physical activity of adolescents are notable examples that can help enhance monitoring of progress across the SDGs, particularly SDG 2 (enhanced nutrition) and SDG 3 (health and well-being). In addition, the domain of adolescent well-being is an emerging field that could provide impetus for the refinement of the SDG framework. Building on previous work by GAMA and other measurement initiatives, the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health, the WHO, and the UN H6+ partner agencies are notably pioneering the development of a global measurement approach for adolescent well-being [18 ]. In anticipation of the 2025 Comprehensive Review of the SDG indicators, there is an opportunity to consider the inclusion of these essential aspects of adolescent health as potential additions to the current framework. While essential to promote accountability against global priority setting, measurement frameworks such as the SDGs and the GAMA indicators have limitations that are important to address. When the Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators developed its first proposed list of SDG indicators in 2015, it was tasked to summarize an intensive process of open consultations with countries, international agencies, civil society organizations, academia, and the private sector through a measurement framework containing the least possible number of indicators, initially one indicator per SDG target [19 ]. Prioritizing the choice of indicators was both a formidable technical challenge and a highly political process [19 ]. This provides context for the omission of key aspects of adolescent health demonstrated in this study and further highlights the need to supplement global measurement frameworks with more localized approaches. In particular, developing national-level programmatic monitoring indicators is an important area for future work. National indicators are crucial to obtain the more granular data required to plan and monitor priority interventions, such as those addressing adolescent well-being, overweight, and obesity [7 ]. This systematic mapping should be considered in light of its limitations. First, given the interlinked nature of the SDGs [20 ], parsing out the relationships between specific SDG indicators and adolescent health was a delicate exercise. We tried to reduce this complexity by defining three categories based on the strength of the relationship between the SDG indicators and established priority areas for adolescent health measurement [15 ]. Doing so allowed us to distinguish which indicators were most relevant or directly related  to the well-being of adolescents, while also acknowledging that other indicators focusing on more distant determinants of health might still bear an influence on adolescents' lives. However, it must be noted that the residual category of indicators considered remotely related  to adolescent health reflected large variability. Second, relying on a pre-established list of priority areas for adolescent health measurement may have restricted our understanding of adolescent health. Nonetheless, these areas are based on a structured selection, including youth representatives, country priorities, disease burden, and a review of existing measurement efforts, which have been thoroughly described elsewhere [15 ]. Conclusions Halfway through the 2030 Agenda, there is an urgent need for improved monitoring of progress for adolescent health, well-being, and coming of age in an increasingly complex world. As noted in the 2022 progress report on the Every Woman Every Child Global Strategy for Women's, Children's, and Adolescents' Health, the “three C's” of the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and conflicts have had disproportionate impacts on adolescents while also causing disruptions in data collection efforts [21 ]. More than ever, renewed commitments and investments for the measurement of adolescent health are needed, namely through consistent age disaggregation and inclusion of additional adolescent health priority areas. Enhanced attention to adolescent health measurement illuminates the unique needs of this critical age group, catalyzing increased investments to improve their health and well-being. Our systematic mapping reveals that the current SDG framework alone is insufficient to comprehensively track adolescent health. It further demonstrates the potential of the GAMA indicators to help monitor progress in adolescents' lives and health post-2030. Leveraging the synergies between both frameworks—the SDGs and the GAMA indicators—can enable governments and other stakeholders to better understand the adolescent health profile of their countries and prioritize investment.
