                  Raising stakeholder awareness of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) may enhance pro-sustainable behavior. However, little is known regarding the extent to which SDG-related information affects stakeholder preferences in supporting the realization of the SDGs. The aim of this study is to determine whether raising awareness of the SDGs affects stakeholder support for companies that contribute to SDG realization. We examined the heterogeneous effects of personal characteristics, including demographics, personality traits, and pro-sustainable attitudes, on (1) stakeholder preferences and (2) raising awareness. This study employed a national representative survey dataset (n = 6048) collected in Japan in March 2019. We used a conjoint survey experiment dataset, which elicited stakeholder preferences for companies that contribute to the realization of the SDGs. We investigated how these preferences shift with the provision of SDG-related knowledge, and determined how personal characteristics affects such shifts. Our results showed that the respondents in the treatment groups were provided with sustainable development-related information, they were more likely to support SDG-minded companies compared with the control group. However, the results also indicated that stakeholder preferences and effects of the information provision were heterogeneous, and consequently, the impact of raising awareness can be complex.

Handling editor: Yutao Wang Raising stakeholder awareness of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) may enhance pro-sustainable behavior. However, little is known regarding the extent to which SDG-related information affects stakeholder preferences in supporting the realization of the SDGs. The aim of this study is to determine whether raising awareness of the SDGs affects stakeholder support for companies that contribute to SDG realization. We examined the heterogeneous effects of personal characteristics, including demographics, personality traits, and pro-sustainable attitudes, on (1) stakeholder preferences and (2) raising awareness. This study employed a national representative survey dataset (n = 6048) collected in Japan in March 2019. We used a conjoint survey experiment dataset, which elicited stakeholder preferences for companies that contribute to the realization of the SDGs. We investigated how these preferences shift with the provision of SDG-related knowledge, and determined how personal characteristics affects such shifts. Our results showed that the respondents in the treatment groups were provided with sustainable development-related information, they were more likely to support SDG-minded companies compared with the control group. However, the results also indicated that stakeholder preferences and effects of the information provision were heterogeneous, and consequently, the impact of raising awareness can be complex.   Keywords Sustainable development goals  Corporate social responsibility  Conjoint survey experiment  Personality traits   Abbreviations Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)     1 Introduction Even though the world has been working towards achieving a sustainable society ever since the conception of sustainable development in Our Common Future (The World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987 ), challenges such as inequality, climate change, and poverty still exist. To address such challenges, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of global goals agreed upon by all United Nations member nations, appeal to everyone, including individuals, governments, and corporate organizations, to ensure responsible consumption and production patterns (United Nations, 2015 ). The SDGs can promote a normative shift towards sustainable and inclusive development (Fukuda-Parr and McNeill, 2019 ). However, to ensure SDG implementation, societal systems have to make complex and fundamental transformations (The Bertelsmann Stiftung and Sustainable Development Solutions Network, 2018 ). Further, to achieve these transformations, global citizens have to change their daily behavior by shifting to more sustainable lifestyles (Rauschmayer et al., 2015 ). This takes a long time and is influenced by political, market, and individual factors (Lubowiecki-Vikuk et al., 2021 ). A study on pro-environmental behavior revealed that raising environmental awareness enhances responsible environmental behavior (Pavalache-Ilie and Cazan, 2018 ). Raising public awareness of the SDGs is one of the essential factors for their implementation (Guan et al., 2019 ); however, to the best of our knowledge, the extent to which SDG-related information affects the perceptions of individuals as well as their support for the SDGs has not been sufficiently clarified. Furthermore, businesses are essential players in the implementation of the SDGs, and they are expected to play more active roles in the future (GRI; UN Global Compact, 2018 ; Scott and McGill, 2018 ). Businesses have been contributing to sustainable development, for example through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) (Ye et al., 2020 ). In the last decades, a body of literature has emerged focusing specifically on developing theoretical schemes to define or explain CSR (Bansal and Song, 2017 ; Carroll and Shabana, 2010 ; Latapí Agudelo et al., 2019 ; Nave and Ferreira, 2019 ), and over the years, the interpretation of CSR has been broadened. In the 1950s, the main social responsibility of companies was solely to generate profit. In the 1980s, it shifted towards contributing to social issues through philanthropic activities, and in the 2000s (Ye et al., 2020 ), it became integrated as a corporate strategy and focused on the creation of shared value and strategic management (Porter and Kramer, 2006, 2011 ). While the SDGs appeal to the private sector to contribute financially for their realization (United Nations Secretary-General, 2019 ), companies can also create value by investing in these goals (Business & Sustainable Development Commission: BSDC, 2017 ). Both scholarly evidence and practical expeience have shown that companies can create value through CSR because individual stakeholders reward companies engaged in CSR activities (Bhattacharya et al., 2009 ). However, a recent literature review on CSR and sustainable development has shown that the contribution of CSR practice to achieving the SDGs needs to be further investigated (Ye et al., 2020 ). While a large numbers of studies have discussed companies’ social responsibility, limited studies uncover the stakeholder perspective (Buerke et al., 2017 ). To fill these two research gaps discussed above, the objective of this study is to investigate the impacts of raising awareness of the SDGs on stakeholder support for companies that contribute to achieving the SDGs. We test if raising stakeholder awareness about sustainable development may influence them to be more sustainability-conscious and lead to responsible behavior. Previous studies have shown that personal characteristics, such as demographics, personality traits, and daily habits, are associated with the pro-sustainable behavior of individual stakeholders (i.e., Buerke et al., 2017 ; Pavalache-Ilie and Cazan, 2018 ; Rosati and Faria, 2019 ). However, little is known regarding the perception of individuals and response to information regarding SDG-related concerns. Thus, this study investigates the individual characteristics related to individual stakeholder decision-making regarding their support for companies that contribute to achieving the SDGs and their perception of information. This study draws from a dataset that is based on a national representative survey (n = 6048) that was collected in Japan in March 2019. We used a conjoint survey experiment that elicited the preferences of stakeholders for company contributions to SDG realization, investigated how these preferences shift with SDG-related knowledge acquisition, and determined how personal characteristics affect such shifts. Caiado et al. (2018)  demonstrated that the SDGs require collective global action by different actors, including multinational enterprises (MNEs). Thus, it can be concluded that in-depth research using large sample sizes aimed at effective implementation of SDGs is required. Individual beliefs contribute to corporate behavior; therefore, it is helpful to understand the impacts of personal characteristics on CSR (Ivanaj et al., 2013 ). Contributions from MNEs are vital for achieving SDGs (Kolk et al., 2017 ; van Zanten and van Tulder, 2018 ). However, some studies have revealed that certain companies engage in SDG washing, wherein the SDGs are used only as a means of complying with societal expectations without actually contributing toward sustainable development (Buhmann, 2018 ; Kim, 2018 ). If businesses use the SDGs only to create a cleaner image to present to stakeholders without taking the sustainability challenges seriously, stakeholders will not trust these businesses to create value to achieve the SDGs. Therefore, we also discuss how the finding in this paper can inform MNEs in advancing SDG implementation, although the focus of this study was not exclusively MNEs, but companies in general. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2  provides a literature review and discusses the conceptual framework and hypotheses for the study, Section 3  introduces the methodology, including data collection and survey design. Further, Section 4  discusses the empirical strategy, and in Section 5 , the results are presented. Finally, in Section 6 , the results are discussed, and some conclusions, including potential implications for MNEs, are also presented.  2 Conceptual framework and hypotheses 2.1 Effects of personal characteristics on stakeholder preferences regarding the contribution of businesses to sustainable development In this study, we examined the effects of personal characteristics, including demographics, personality traits, and pro-sustainable behavior, on stakeholder preferences for businesses that contribute to sustainable development. Table 1   provides a summary of hypotheses. Demographic characteristics, including age, gender, educational level, and income level can, to a certain extent, effect on the behaviors of stakeholders with respect to sustainable development (BSDC, 2017 ; Gifford and Nilsson, 2014 ; Jones et al., 2017 ; Rosati and Faria, 2019 ). An increasing number of studies have explored the relationships between demographic characteristics and environmental attitudes or concerns. These studies have shown that pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors correlate with different individual characteristics (Brick and Lewis, 2014 ). For example, Ruegger and King (1992)  showed that age is associated with ethical decisions. However, Rosati et al. (2018)  observed that age has no significant effect on an employee’s feelings regarding CSR. Recent studies have shown that younger individuals may be more attracted to companies that contribute to sustainable causes than their older counterparts (BSDC, 2017 ; White et al., 2019 ). Gender also explains the heterogeneity of preferences towards corporate behavior. Women tend to be less likely to trust in and be satisfied with CSR than men (Rosati et al., 2018 ). Although the results of previous studies claim that a gap exists between the environmental attitudes and behaviors of consumers, this gap can be explained by gender, considering that women have a smaller gap between attitudes and behaviors than men (Jones et al., 2017 ). Studies on pro-environmental behavior have shown that women are more likely to report stronger environmental attitudes, concerns, and behaviors than men (Gifford and Nilsson, 2014 ). In contrast, a study by Pérez and Rodríguez del Bosque (2013)  illustrated that gender is not associated with the formation of favorable CSR perceptions. Reportedly, the educational level of respondents has no effect on the CSR attitudes of bank customers in Spain (Pérez and Rodríguez del Bosque, 2013 ) or employees in Turkey (Akman, 2011 ). However, a study on employee attitudes towards aspects such as CSR level of commitment, trust, and satisfaction demonstrated that more educated employees have a more positive attitude towards CSR than their less educated counterparts (Rosati et al., 2018 ). In addition to demographic characteristics, studies aimed at clarifying the relationships between pro-environmental behaviors and personality traits have also been conducted (Brick and Lewis, 2014 ; Pavalache-Ilie and Cazan, 2018 ). A particular study revealed that personality traits, such as honesty, agreeableness, openness, and proactiveness, have an effect on environmental behavior (Pavalache-Ilie and Cazan, 2018 ). In a study of the greenhouse gas emission reduction behavior of adults in the United States, Brick and Lewis (2014)  suggested that openness, conscientiousness, and extraversion are strong predictors of pro-environmental behavior. In a more recent study, the role of core values and personality traits in an individual’s support for a broad set of corporate sustainability practices, including economic, social, and environmental actions, was investigated, and it was observed that some personality traits are associated with these sustainable practices (Marcus and Roy, 2019 ). Additionally, these previous studies suggest that personality traits are one of the critical factors that predicts sustainable behavior; however, to the best of our knowledge, little research has been conducted in the context of the SDGs. Furthermore, the relationships between consumers’ purchasing behavior and their environmental concerns and values have been investigated in several previous studies (Buerke et al., 2017 ; Farrow et al., 2017 ; Gonçalves et al., 2016 ; Lin and Huang, 2012 ). Lin and Huang (2012)  confirmed that a high environmental concern positively influences green purchase decisions. A functional value (i.e., one of the five values defined in the theory of consumption values) is necessary to predict green buying; however, combining emotional, conditional, and social values is also necessary (Gonçalves et al., 2016 ). Both consumer awareness and pro-sustainable attitudes positively correlate with responsible consumer behavior (Buerke et al., 2017 ). Based on the discussion of the abovementioned literature, which explore of the effects of personal characteristic on stakeholder preferences for corporate sustainable behavior, we developed the following hypothesis:H1 Personal characteristics—(a) demographics, (b) personality traits, and (c) sustainable behavior—are associated with stakeholders’ preferences for companies that contribute to the realization of the SDGs.    2.2 Effects of sustainable development-related information on individual stakeholders Around the world, studies have been conducted regarding the influence of available information on sustainable purchase decisions for different products and contexts. Specifically, in a study conducted in Germany, the effect of information on purchase decisions related to dairy products was explored, and it was observed that the welfare of animals had the greatest influence among environmental protection and human rights (Hasanzade et al., 2018 ). Another study in Germany showed that if information, e.g., on the environmental impact and employee working conditions behind products is provided, consumers may base their decisions on this information, and the influence of this information is approximately the same as the influence of the product’s price (Stöckigt et al., 2018 ). A study of the furniture industry in the US and China argued that consumers preferred the companies with a high level of CSR to companies that did not provide their CSR activity information (Cai and Aguilar, 2013 ). However, in the context of electric vehicles, Shao and Ünal (2019)  investigated purchase decision in different parts of Europe and concluded that the awareness of sustainable performance was not necessarily associated with behavior, although they acknowledged its importance. Studies in France showed that advertising the green benefits of products did not significantly affect on the decision to purchase products (Grolleau et al., 2019 ). In addition to purchase decisions, other behaviors, such as job-seeking and investing, have been investigated. Some studies conducted in Turkey (Alniacik et al., 2011 ) and the US (Sen et al., 2006 ) showed that providing information on a company’s CSR activities increases the support for that company with respect to the three areas of consumer behavior. With respect to providing information to stakeholders, we developed the following hypothesis:H2 Providing SDG-related information has heterogeneous effects on stakeholders with different personal characteristics—(a) demographics, (b) personality traits, and (c) sustainable behavior.   As discussed above, information generally plays a positive role in the sustainable development-related decision-making of individual stakeholders; however, the amount and form in which the information should be provided needs to be carefully examined. Previous studies have provided a theoretical framework on the relationship between information strategy and pro-environmental behavior, and claim that decision quality and the quantity of information made available to stakeholders create an inverted U-curve, where the former increases to a certain point and then decreases (Bougherara et al., 2007 ). Several recent studies have added empirical evidence regarding the effect of the quantity of information given. Labeling, which is a source of pro-environmental information, is commonly used to influence consumers’ decision-making. A study in Germany revealed that certified sustainable investment products have higher stated preference among private investors (Gutsche and Ziegler, 2019 ). However, increasing the number of sustainability labels, such as fair trade or organic food, did not influence the consumers’ decision-making (Tebbe and von Blanckenburg, 2018 ). A study on sustainable lifestyle in the U.K. revealed that providing more knowledge can be a source of dilemma, tension, and paralysis (Longo et al., 2019 ). With respect to the quantity of information provided to stakeholders, we developed the following hypothesis:H3 Providing additional SDG-related information has additional effects on the support of stakeholders with different personal characteristics ((a) demographics, (b) personality traits, and (c) sustainable behavior) for companies that contribute to the realization of the SDGs.     3 Materials and methods 3.1 Data collection and sampling We conducted a nationwide online survey in Japan. Rakuten Insight, Inc., one of Japan’s largest research companies, with a pool of 2.2 million panelists across the country, sampled Japanese respondents aged between 18 and 74. To ensure that the final data matched the population distribution, the recruitment of respondents considered the age and gender of the respondents as well as regional residential quotas. Data collection was conducted for five days in March 2019 using an online survey system, Qualtrics. Participants were requested to perform several tasks, including reading short texts and answering a wide range of questions. An invitation e-mail was sent to approximately 60,000 panelists, 8957 individuals participated, and a total of 6043 of them completed the entire survey.  3.2 Conjoint survey with the information treatment experiment We used the conjoint survey proposed by Hainmueller et al. (2014)  to request the 6043 respondents to evaluate 71,920 hypothetical profiles of companies’ SDG contributions.1  1 Some of the respondents answered the questions only five times because the first question for the consumer group was not set as a required question. The exclusion of these respondents would have unbalanced the sample groups, and the missing sample was a small portion (298 out of 6043). Therefore, these respondents were included in our analysis.   The experiment included seven sets of attributes: six SDGs and an economic return directly earned from SDG-related activities. Table 2   provides the conjoint attribute design, and Fig. 1   provides a sample of the conjoint experiment questions. In the supplementary material, Fig. S1  presents the overall survey flow, and Table S6  presents descriptive statistics of the respondents. Before commencing the conjoint experiments, respondents were randomly assigned into one of four groups: 1) control, 2) T1, 3) T2, and 4) T1&T2. The control group received no treatment information. The first treatment group (T1) received information, which stated that the businesses in question are expected to incorporate sustainability into their usual practices, that they must make those activities profitable, and that these activities must extend beyond charitable aids. The second treatment group (T2) received information, which stated that there are significant gaps in the progress towards achieving the SDGs between developed and developing countries. The first and second information treatment group (T1&T2) received information corresponding to both the T1 and T2 groups. The respondents in the treatment groups were requested to read the provided information, take a quiz to confirm their understanding, and reread the same information if they failed the quiz. Original and translated information and quizzes used in the survey are provided in Figs. S2–S4  in the supplementary material, and original scenarios given are in Fig. S5 . We then randomly assigned all the respondents to one of three primary stakeholder groups: consumers, investors, and job-seekers, considering that an individual can have multiple stakeholder relationships with a given corporation (Sen et al., 2006 ). Each respondent was shown two randomly assigned hypothetical companies, with characteristics that differ along a set of attributes (Table 2 ). Further, the respondents were shown three choices on their screens, which they ranked in the order of preference as if they were to choose a company to purchase a product, invest or work for. From the three choices, the respondents were required to select either of the hypothetical companies or choose neither of them. They performed this task six times. After the conjoint tasks were completed, all the respondents were then assigned the same questions on personal characteristics, personality traits, and pro-sustainable attitudes. Table 3   describes the variables measured in the survey.  3.3 Information treatment According to a survey conducted by Nikkei, a major Japanese newspaper, approximately 60% of Japanese companies embedded the SDGs into their corporate strategies in 2019 (The Nikkei, 2019 ). However, only 6.702% of our study participants reported strong familiarity with the SDGs, indicating awareness was low during our study. Therefore, we used two pieces of information for the test. The criteria for selecting these pieces of information are discussed in the following paragraph. The SDGs bring opportunities for businesses (BSDC, 2017 ) along with the expectation that these businesses will embed sustainable development into their core corporate strategies (Ohno et al., 2019 ; SDG Compass, 2015 ; United Nations, 2015 ). Therefore, we argued that SDG-related practices must be profitable and should extend beyond charitable aid. Ensuring economic value creation can motivate businesses to promote the realization of the SDGs. However, the Japanese are reluctant to support companies that obtain profits from social causes (Kim, 2018 ). Considering this local context, we supplied the respondents in the T1 treatment group with information that economic value creation through SDG implementation is important, and we included the attribute, direct economic return from SDG-related activities in the experiment. In addition, considering that individual goals and targets may be conflicting (Barbier and Burgess, 2019 ; International Council for Science, 2017 ; Mainali et al., 2018 ), understanding the tradeoff system among the SDGs is essential in advancing their implementation (Pradhan, 2019 ). Therefore, we supplied the respondents in the T2 treatment group with information illustrating that different goals are achieved differently.   4 Empirical strategy To investigate the heterogeneous effects of personal characteristics on stakeholder support for companies contributing to SDG implementation, we estimated the overall support rate for the most SDG-minded company using the estimation model:l o g i t ( Y i t j   ) = β 0  + ∑ l = 1  7  ∑ r = 1  4  ∑ h = 1  2  β l r h   S D G i t j l   R C T i r   H E T i h   + u i t j   ,    where Y ∈ { 0,1 }     is a binary choice outcome for company j   in task t   of respondent i  ; is equal to 1, if the preference rank of a company is higher than both the status quo (choose neither of the companies) and an alternative company; otherwise, it is equal to 0; S D G i t j l      is a dummy variable for attribute l   (one of two levels in each attribute is the baseline level, and no SDG contributions  and no profit  are excluded from the regression expression); R C T i r     is a dummy variable for information treatment r   , which is randomly attributed to respondent i   ; H E T i h     is a dummy variable for personal characteristic h    of respondent i  ; β l r h      is a parameter of attribute l  , information treatment r   , and personal characteristic h   ; β 0    denotes a constant term; and u i t j      denotes the error term. Using interaction terms in the logistic regression, we predicted support for all the possible combinations separately for each personal characteristic presented in Table 3 . In particular, we calculated the heterogeneous effect of information treatment on support for the most SDG-minded company, which is defined in Table 2 .  5 Results  Figs. 2–5  show the estimated overall support for the most SDG-minded company. Detailed results regarding the conditional treatment effects estimated using LASSOplus proposed by Ratkovic and Tingley (2017)  are presented in Fig. S7  of the supplementary material. The estimated overall support of different stakeholder groups is also presented in Figs. S8–S10 . These results showed that the individual features of the contribution of companies to the realization of the SDGs received positive public support, and information treatment generally had positive effects on stakeholder support for companies that contribute to SDG realization. As our objective was to investigate the heterogeneous effects of information treatment, we do not discuss stakeholder support for the individual features of a company’s contribution to the realization of SDGs here and instead focus on the company as a whole. For the same reason, we do not discuss the types of stakeholders here and instead focus on the stakeholders as a whole. Support rates estimated using the pooled data showed that providing one piece of information (T1 and T2 groups) has positive effects relative to the control group, and providing two pieces of information (T1&T2 group) has an additional treatment effect (see Fig. 2 ). In the following sub-sections, the heterogeneous effects of personal characteristics are discussed, and a summary of the results is presented in Table 4  . 5.1 Demographic characteristics Fig. 3   shows the treatment effects of demographic characteristics on stakeholder decisions. With respect to gender, support rates were similar without information provision; however, as more information was provided, women’s support rate increased. In the control group, the support rate was slightly higher for women than men. In the treatment groups, women were more responsive to information, as indicated by the widening gap between support rates (Panel 1). With regard to educational level, there was a large gap between support rates in the control group. Specifically, in the control group, respondents with a higher educational level showed a significantly higher support rate than their counterparts with a lower educational level. Further, in the treatment groups, the respondents with a lower educational level were responsive to information, whereas those with a higher educational level did not respond to information provision (Panel 2). Regarding income level, the respondents with a higher income level showed a higher support rate, and it was also observed that both high- and low-income respondents were responsive to information provision (Panel 3). With respect to generation, older respondents showed higher support rates than their younger counterparts. Both were responsive to information provision (Panel 4).  5.2 Personality traits To examine the treatment effects of personality traits, we employed the Japanese version of the Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI), which is employed to assess the Big Five personality dimensions (TIPI-J; Oshio et al., 2012 ), which include extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to experience. Fig. 4   shows the estimated results for the five different personality traits, demonstrating that personality traits have various effects on stakeholder decisions. The support rate was higher among respondents with higher extraversion, neuroticism, or openness personality traits compared with those who were on the lower end of the scale. Additionally, both respondents with high and low measures were responsive to information treatment (Panel 1, 2, and 5). The respondents with high agreeableness showed high support rates compared to lower agreeableness respondents, even without information provision. However, the support rate increased for low agreeableness with information provision, whereas no effect was observed for high agreeableness respondents (Panel 2).  5.3 Daily pro-sustainable behavior Fig. 5   presents the estimated results corresponding to daily pro-sustainable behavior. We used two indicators ((1) pro-globalization behavior and (2) pro-environmental behavior) to measure the heterogeneous effects of such behaviors on the support rate for companies that contribute to achieving the SDGs. Respondents with high pro-environmental or pro-globalization behavior showed higher support for the most SDG-minded company. Overall, both groups were responsive to the provided information. In the T1 and T2 groups, except for high globalization behavior, the support rate was the highest relative to other groups, indicating that providing two pieces of information induced more positive effects than providing just a single piece of information. However, in the T1&T2 group for high globalization behavior, the support rate was lower than in other treatment groups, indicating that providing two pieces of information induced negative effects.   6 Discussion and conclusions In this study, we explored the effects of raising awareness of SDG-related information on stakeholder support for companies that contribute to SDG realization. Thus, we provided information to respondents and examined how raising awareness affects their support for such companies. Further, we determined how information treatment is perceived by individual stakeholders with different personal characteristics. When respondents were provided with sustainable development-related information, they generally showed a positive attitude towards sustainable development. The results suggest that raising stakeholder awareness of sustainable development can influence them to be more sustainability- conscious and leads to responsible behavior, which refers to supporting companies engage in SDG implementation in this study. However, the results indicated that stakeholder preferences as well as effects of the information provided to them were heterogeneous, suggesting, that the impact of raising awareness on behavior transformation can be complex. Our results demonstrated one general pattern; the control group showed heterogeneous effects, the T1 or T2 groups showed positive treatment effects, and the T1&T2 group showed additional treatment effects. Overall, differences among the heterogeneous groups remained similar. Another pattern observed was that one heterogeneous group was not responsive to the provided information, and this resulted in a widening or narrowing of the support rate gap. As more information was provided, support rates for women increased, whereas men were relatively unresponsive to the provided information, resulting in the widening of the support rate gap between genders. Gifford and Nilsson (2014)  reviewed studies on pro-environmental behavior and claimed that women tend to report stronger environmental attitudes, concerns, and behavior than men; however, our study showed more complex results. Torelli et al. (2019)  showed that gender did not significantly influence the overall perception of environmental responsibility and corporate greenwashing; however, our result demonstrated that gender affects perceived information. High agreeableness respondents were highly supportive towards the most SDG-minded company; however, information treatment did not affect them, resulting in a narrowing of the support rate gap. Respondents with higher educational levels were not responsive to the provided information, whereas the support rate increased for respondents with a lower educational level when they received the information. These results indicated that promoting sustainability awareness using the information on the nature of the SDGs generally has positive effects on the pro-company behavior of stakeholders. Companies usually advertise their involvement in social causes; however, they do not address the social issues themselves (Du et al., 2010 ). Therefore, when communicating via social issues rather than via product-specific or company-specific information, favorable CSR consumer ratings increased, especially when the issues were not related to corporate activities (Menon and Kahn, 2003 ). Therefore, we suggest that companies should be responsible for promoting social issues in addition to reporting their contribution to sustainable development. The results of this study will assist corporate managers in the development of a strategy for effective communication with stakeholders to create value through achieving the SDGs. Furthermore, the findings of this study provide useful evidence for businesses to form a strategy to develop relationships with stakeholders; however, such strategies should not be used for SDG washing. Considering that MNEs have substantial global influence through their subsidiaries and value chains, they are responsible for utilizing the SDGs to raise awareness to advance a sustainable society. This study provides further insight into stakeholder preferences based on the analysis of the heterogeneous effects of personal characteristics. It also examines the personal factors that are most associated with stakeholder decisions to support companies that contribute to SDG-realization. Further, it provides preliminary but vital insights into the contribution of businesses in creating value towards achieving sustainable development. However, several important limitations need to be considered. This study was not specifically designed to evaluate the factors related to information communication channels or instruments; however, as a study by Lazaric et al. (2020)  demonstrated that communication channels are essential in stimulating sustainable consumption, considering the means of communication may be useful in future studies. In addition, the scope of the study should be broadened to other countries to increase knowledge on effective SDG implementation.
