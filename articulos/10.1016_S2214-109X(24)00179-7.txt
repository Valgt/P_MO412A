This is an Open Access article under the CC BY 4.0 license Analysis and Interpretation  Comment    Panel How a focus on unimplementability strengthened a polio vaccination project in Nigeria6    As late as 2012, over half of known global polio cases occurred in Nigeria. By 2020, the country was celebrating a landmark victory, having been declared free of wild polio. This change was catalysed by a combination of political, religious, and cultural dynamics. A notable dispute emerged in 2003 between the Nigerian Federal Government and some northern regional governments and religious leaders over the safety of the oral polio vaccine, causing a cessation of vaccination efforts in those areas.7   Gradually, a broad coalition formed, including religious leaders, governmental figures, health-care professionals, and international entities, to tackle the issue. This coalition's efforts were marked by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative's massive social mobilisation campaign, one of the most extensive in African public health history. Through open dialogue, these stakeholders identified and addressed the underlying reasons for the vaccine resistance. Religious leaders who once opposed the vaccine became advocates for it, addressing misconceptions and promoting vaccination on the basis of shared community values.8   This collective effort began not with consensus but with diverse opinions and disagreements. The goal of polio eradication in Nigeria was achieved by harnessing these disagreements to build a vibrant, questioning, and passionate community movement that not only challenged received wisdom and top-down directives but shaped and improved the shared goals and the collective effort needed to achieve them.

As Richard Horton1   critically observes, what was meant to be a “manifesto to create a better, safer, and more resilient world” has not materialised as planned, emerging instead as a “promise without a plan”. A high-level meeting linked to the 78th UN General Assembly in September, 2023, painted a bleak picture: not a single one of the 17 SDGs is on course to reach its target, with SDG3 (dedicated to health and wellbeing) being no exception.2   Examining the cases in which key SDGs have been achieved is worthwhile. These are not, in general, cases in which stakeholders were aligned and implementation followed a textbook protocol. On the contrary, such cases were characterised—as in all complex projects—by diverse viewpoints, multiple interests and conflicts of interest, little agreement on goals, and even overt hostility among stakeholders.3   But these cases seem to have one unique and salutary feature: conflicts were actively harnessed to strengthen the project rather than glossed over or denied.4,5   For example, instead of lamenting implementation failure, the many stakeholders in the Nigerian polio eradication effort transformed their differences, initially seen as obstacles, into valuable resources (panel  ). Rather than attempting to erase disputes over interpretations, values, and priorities, these differences were embraced as constructive disagreements to be confronted and used as catalysts for change.4   The Nigerian example illustrates an important theoretical point. If we approach the SDGs as fixed goals to be addressed through programmes and plans to be implemented and cascaded at national, regional, and local levels, we create a paradox of unimplementability. Framing an SDG in terms of a plan to be implemented overlooks the reality that conflicts and contradictions are inherent to all complex initiatives. There is never an uncontested shared vision. Rather, there are multiple versions of the problem, multiple perspectives on the solutions, and multiple vested interests. One person's (or group's) successful delivery of the plan is another's painful compromise. Indeed, laying out one plan (singular) necessarily raises some stakeholder perspectives to the status of legitimate voices and renders other perspectives invisible simply because, in the name of coherence, dissenting views are not mentioned. Briggs9   explores the paradox of incommunicability, highlighting the widespread belief that communication breakdowns, such as those between doctors and patients, originate from the inability of some individuals or groups to assimilate “medical, educational, and other rationalities”, leading to their categorisation as poorly behaved or non-compliant patients. Ironically, this perspective itself fosters further incommunicability, resulting in increased disagreements and misunderstandings. Building on Briggs's concept, we challenge the paradox of unimplementability, which marginalises specific individuals and groups by labelling them as unable to undertake actions in line with contemporary, rational, and liberal ideals. Unimplementability is viewed as a failure of the people expected to carry out the implementation. Instead, we see unimplementability as a potentially productive concept. Rather than assuming that implementation will succeed if people merely follow a predetermined plan, we should view the process as inherently contentious, with such contestation offering opportunities for transformation. Instead of trying to eliminate conflicts over meanings, values, and misunderstandings, these differences should be made explicit and examined to influence and shape—and indeed enhance and enrich—collective progress in the direction of an SDG.
