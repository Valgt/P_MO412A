                  ‘There is no planet B!’ This sentence is commonly used every day, partially because of the current model of the linear economy. The unlimited use of natural resources and generation of by-products as discards disregards the fact that the available source materials are limited. In contrast, the circular economy brings a new perspective of food development to minimize food waste and/or reintroduce food by-products in the production chain. The generation of by-products enriched in bioactive compounds during food processing is a reality, along with the demand for natural additives and/or functional food development with bioactive compounds. Looking into this context, the aim of this mini review is to briefly summarize the missing points to ‘close the circle’ regarding natural phenolic antioxidants.

The unlimited use of natural resources and generation of by-products as discards disregards the fact that the available source materials are limited. In contrast, the circular economy brings a new perspective of food development to minimize food waste and/or reintroduce food by-products in the production chain. The generation of by-products enriched in bioactive compounds during food processing is a reality, along with the demand for natural additives and/or functional food development with bioactive compounds.

All rights reserved.      Introduction Beginning in the 18th century, the industrial revolution has brought major productivity improvements, but also an economic model based on extraction, transformation, use, and disposal, that is, “converting natural resources into waste during the production chain”.  This linear model has caused resource overexploitation and pollution on a planetary scale, with consequences for both economic and social developments as well as for agricultural production. In fact, we continue considering practices that fall back on the 18th century, and therefore do not respect the limits of natural resources [1] . The first contemporary environmental movements began in the 1960s with the publication of the book ‘Silent Spring’ written by Carson [2] . The author questioned the indiscriminate exploitation of resources, monocultures, and the excessive use of toxic substances in the environment. In this stage, the concept of ‘sustainable development’ was created, emphasizing the importance of managing natural resources today to ensure future generations’ quality of life [2] . As opposed to the linear economy, the concept of circular economy appeared in 1989, in a book written by British economists and environmentalists David W. Pearce and R. Kerry Turner [3] . More recently, Deutz [4]  described the circular economy as “an economic system designed with the intention that maximum use is extracted from resources and minimum waste is generated for disposal”.  From the 1990s onward, the concept of sustainability began to influence society and to be understood as the integration of economic, social, and environmental prosperity. Within the same context, the Food and Agriculture Organization brought three principles of circular economy: Efficient use of primary resources; Eco-design; and Reuse/recycling [5] . In parallel, with a more informative language, the 9R framework — refuse, rethink, reduce, reuse, repair, refurbish, remanufacture, repurpose, recycle, and recover — was created as a circular strategy within the production chain. In this scenario, scientists can interact with companies and consumers as well as participate in industrial symbiosis in which wastes or by-products from one industry become the feedstock for another one, being crucial actors in this economic model [6] . The reintroduction of waste into the production chain is one of the most important fields of action of circular economy. The downcycling phenomenon is characterized by “quality reduction of materials reprocessed from waste relative to their original quality” , while upcycling can be a creative practice to enable waste valorization [7] . As an example, using food waste to produce fertilizer (downcycling) contrasts with using agro-industrial waste as a source of functional ingredients, bioactive, and/or nutraceutical compounds (upcycling). One of the main benefits from an economic point of view is the low cost of waste or by-products compared with other raw materials. However, the nature of the by-product may also bring together several hurdles in terms of safety/toxicological issues. In parallel to such scenario, it is already well-recognized that oxidative stress is common to several chronic diseases (e.g. cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and obesity) and that antioxidant intake, such as vitamins A, C, E, selenium, and carotenoids can reduce redox imbalance. However, according to the literature [8] , phenolic compounds may be responsible for more than 90% of the antioxidants ingested daily. There is a clear call to increase and promote phenolic antioxidant intake, along with major potential use of agro-food industry wastes by upcycling them as rich sources of phenolic acids, flavonoids, and tannins, to name a few. The concentration of phenolic antioxidants from different commodities and by-products is widely studied and compiled in different databases and/or review articles [9–11] . Nevertheless, considering that insoluble-bound phenolics (IBPs) can be the most biologically relevant fraction for phenolics from plant foods and their by-products and IBPs are the key to zero waste, some questions remain: are insoluble data accurate and updated? What is the current status for nonextractable/IBPs? Aiming to summarize such scenarios, the present review considers gaps and opportunities to close the circle and move toward a zero-waste processing with upcycling views in mind.  Insoluble-bound phenolics Phenolic compounds are secondary metabolites present in plant materials. The soluble fraction is currently defined as those extracted in water or using mixtures containing water and organic solvents (e.g. ethanol, methanol, and acetone). Soluble phenolics can be further subdivided into free or conjugates. Within conjugated phenolics, these natural molecules can be found as esterified and/or etherified forms. In these forms (esterified and/or etherified), phenolics may be linked to carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, organic acids, and other phenolic compounds. Because they are also linked to soluble macromolecules, they can also be defined as soluble macroantioxidants. In contrast, IBPs (also known as nonextractable phenolics) may be linked to cell wall components such as cellulose and lignin as well as structural proteins, among others. In this case, they can also be defined as insoluble macroantioxidants. In terms of recovery, soluble esterified phenolics are released by alkaline hydrolysis, while the etherified ones are extracted with acid hydrolysis at high temperatures. Likewise, IBPs are usually extracted under alkaline conditions [12] . Between 2013 and 2023, roughly 115 thousand articles were published in the phenolics field, according to a quick search of ‘phenolics’ on the Web of Science. Likewise, around 119 thousand articles were found in Scopus. Besides some recent advances, as written recently by Vilas-Franquesa et al. [13] , the same is not true when the term ‘insoluble-bound phenolics’ is used as the keyword of search. In fact, according to this result (249 articles from Web of Science and 166 from Scopus), only about 0.1–0.2% of the studies on phenolics emphasized the contribution of IBPs in different materials. This is an important detail, since IBPs, specifically referring to insoluble compounds linked to the cell wall of the plant material, “account for 20 – 60% of the total phenolics in food matrices and can exceed 70% in leaves, flowers, peels, pulps, seeds, and other counterparts of fruits and vegetables, and up to 99% in cereal brans ” [10] .  Table 1  summarizes the data for the IBPs’ distribution in different food matrices along with their most associated bioactivity — the antioxidant potential. IBPs showed up to 13.4 times higher content of total phenolics. Furthermore, IBPs contributed up to 85.6% to the antiradical activity against peroxyl radicals using the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay, and significant reducing power (up to 95.3%). IBPs also play significant roles in modulating microbiota and intestinal inflammation [11]  and presents a promising anticancer and antidiabetic activity [13] . Therefore, this fraction not only contributes to phenolics’ quantity, but also to samples’ bioactivity.  Table 2  provides some examples of its bioactivities. Furthermore, the presence of metabolites from IBPs (‘so-called’ macroantioxidants) in plasma as well as their antioxidant and/or anti-inflammatory action may last 3–4 days after consumption [14] . Therefore, consumption of IBPs from food by-products may be a sustainable way to deliver antioxidants with a controlled release over time.  The recovery of antioxidant phenolics from by-products: the main missing point to close the circle of circular economy It has been estimated that 25% of the feedstock from the agro-food industry becomes a by-product. In this scenario, it is important to highlight that fruits, vegetables, grains (cereals and legume seeds), and nut by-products generated by industrial processes are rich sources of bioactive compounds such as phenolic antioxidants. Thus, corroborating with circular economy, which falls within the Sustainable Development Goals, the use of plant food by-products is deemed necessary to achieve a more sustainable industry [22] . In summary, in the ideal scenario regarding circular economy and the use of antioxidant phenolics, maximizing of the use of agro-food industry resources should include: 1. the final ‘primary product’ and 2. a possibility to make better use of by-products generated from the primary product, such as functional ingredients — both of them directed to final consumers. With wine production, for example, the wine reaches the final consumer, while the by-products generated, after a full characterization and quantification, may be applied for food products (e.g. yogurt, meat products, and antioxidant extracts) to decrease or inhibit oxidation, which will also reach final consumers.  Figure 1  illustrates this scenario, and each point will be discussed subsequently. It is important to observe that a more detailed description of the whole chain is necessary, such as carbon footprint, transport, production, distribution, and other activities, that should also be sustainable in terms of the energy use and the environment.  The other missing points Full matrix characterization: insoluble-bound phenolics in epidemiological studies and sustainable innovation Within the context mentioned, it is crucial to characterize the source material — the by-product and its characteristics, since the application options are closely related to chemical and functional properties [23] . Several studies have shown that the content of some bioactive compounds has been largely underestimated, mainly because insoluble-bound phenolic antioxidants are neglected, such as those from apple peel, apple pomace, pomegranate peel, pomegranate seed, chestnut shell, and black carrot pomace [9] ; IBPs from cereal grains, fruits, legumes [11] , and raspberry pomace [24] ; and vegetable and herbs [10] . Rice and wheat, two of the most important crops grown worldwide, are great examples of insoluble-bound phenolic overlook. Many studies have demonstrated that phenolics in those cereals (mainly phenolic acids) are primarily concentrated in this fraction [12] . Also, grape by-products' phenolics, mainly proanthocyanidins, were present up to 79% in insoluble form [25] . The presence of IBPs and insoluble-bound alkaloids (e.g. theobromine, trigonelline, nicotinic acid, and paraxanthine) in raw cocoa nibs and husk as well as raw and traditional chocolate was only reported some years ago for the first time [15,26] . The authors demonstrated that some bioactive compounds (phenolic acids, catechins, and alkaloids) from cocoa and its by-products are largely underestimated, and up to 40% of the antioxidant properties of those materials are derived from the contribution of their insoluble-bound fraction [15] . Arruda et al. [27]  showed that IBPs were the major contributors to total phenolics in the edible part of Annona crassiflora  Mart., a native fruit of South America, commonly known as araticum. All this evidence clearly indicates that IBPs are ignored in medical research, yet it does not respond to the question: why are they ignored? Insoluble-bound antioxidants must be considered by physicians and nutritionists, but do they have the necessary information? It is clearly different consuming five times more phenolics than one would think, which could be the case of having a dietary supplement made from grape by-products. In short, by quantifying the soluble phenolics alone, one would know that only 20% of the real dietary phenolics intake, which is quite relevant for intervention and/or epidemiological studies, has been considered. There may also be underestimations of soluble compounds’ quantification. Some classic cases demonstrate that not paying attention to the recovery processes of soluble compounds can lead to a high underestimation of the real content. Even for highly studied raw materials such as wheat and other cereals, the ideal is that each research group or laboratory carries out its in-house validation. For example, based on the literature, one would keep working with aqueous mixtures of methanol (previously reported as the best solvent). However, it was found that mixtures containing acetone may be more efficient [28] . The previously mentioned partial characterization can bring some problems to the epidemiology area, among others. In this type of study, researchers usually collect their data from databases such as the phenol explorer (http://phenol-explorer.eu/ ) and USDA databases (https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/ ) with trustable values and which must be updated, or new sources of phenolics, such as guarana (Paullinia cupana  Kunth) powder as a source of insoluble-bound proanthocyanidins [29] .  Table 3  reports examples of some insoluble-bound phenolic antioxidants from different materials that are not considered in the USDA reports. It is also relevant to consider that in many cases, there are no quantification data available for some specific phenolics in the USDA database, such as phenolic acids and ellagitannins, which can appear in pomegranate and walnuts [30,31] . These factors are important in terms of sustainable innovation. For example, enzyme-assisted extraction is considered a green extraction method to improve the recovery yield of phenolics, as demonstrated by pineapple peel [32] . The cell wall from the plant material and by-products contains mainly polysaccharides, lignin, and structural proteins. The phenolic–carbohydrate complex could thus be released by carbohydrases, alkaline, and acid hydrolysis, depending on food type and the amount of IBPs present [12] . It remains to be seen whether enzyme application is always necessary. One should make a careful study about the contribution of insoluble-bound phenolic antioxidants to make decisions in terms of economic viability. The question of how much more could be obtained via different methods should be asked if one decides to use ultrasound-assisted extraction, supercritical fluid extraction, pressurized liquid extraction, and/or microwave-assisted extraction to release the IBPs. Actually, the recovery of bound phenolics should be carefully evaluated considering the appropriate technique and the food matrix ( Table 4 ), as described by Dzah et al. [40] . However, besides enzymatic hydrolyses aforementioned, other methods such as fermentation or even germination could be considered.  By-products’ safety The literature reports a range of data about phenolic antioxidants or other valuable bioactive compounds from by-products [9,15,24,31,32,45] , while the number of microbiological and toxicological studies related to plant foods’ antioxidants or functional ingredients containing them is quite limited. Recent studies containing microbiological assessment of food by-products and proposed solutions to mitigate issues related to microbial contamination are shown in  Table 5 . The lack of reference values for by-products’ microbiological and toxicological standards as natural carriers of phenolic antioxidants only lead to a worse scenario. In terms of microbiological/toxicological safety, the main challenges are: 1. intrinsic microorganisms of the original raw material; 2. the ability to differentiate intentional use of specific microorganisms in by-product processing and unacceptable conditions. The presence of contaminants such as pesticides and mycotoxins is another consumer security concern when by-products are the main feedstock. The perspectives to consider include: 1. the generation of toxic substances during food processing; 2. the transfer or concentration of natural contaminants from raw material; 3. the higher accumulation of some toxic substances in by-products — seeds or peel from fruits than the raw original material [46] . Despite a few functional properties of by-products allied with safety issues for their use, some works bring information in this regard. De Toledo et al. [45]  demonstrated that the use of passion fruit by-products in drinkable yogurt improved its functional properties, but it was also associated with the growth of yeast and mold in the final product. Patulin, a mycotoxin commonly present in apple and its products, can also be a source of contamination when its by-products are used to enrich foods, hence some pretreatments are strongly recommended [47] . Ochratoxin A, biogenic amines, and pesticides were found in extracts from grape by-products [48] . Likewise, wheat bran, a by-product rich in phenolic acids, may be contaminated by zearalenone and deoxynivalenol [49] . By the other side, some already-used techniques such as irradiation and heat treatment could be used to fill up the microbiology safety gap [50] . Another point is the presence of antinutritional compounds such as condensed tannins, saponins, trypsin inhibitors, phytates, and isoflavonoids that are commonly associated with digestion inhibition or interference in proteins, carbohydrates, and minerals' digestibility and bioavailability. However, some bioprocesses such as fermentation can decrease their presence in food [51] .  Issues surrounding by-products’ incorporation into food Incorporating a new ingredient into some food matrices ( Figure 2 ) requires certain issues to manage: formulation, regulatory framework, processing, compatibility and suitability with other ingredients, recovery of nutrients, addition level of by-products, use of technologies involved, sensory acceptability, changes in color, texture, shelf life, and nutritional characteristics. It is important to observe that each bioactive compound and/or functional ingredient has different outcomes in each food matrix, and the challenges faced may be quite significant [52] . As an example, despite the functional improvement observed in yogurt fortified with fruits, vegetables, cereals, honey, and by-products, some challenges arise, including shelf life, rheological and sensory issues, and microbial characteristics [53] . Sensory changes were also noticed when bread was fortified with grape pomace powder [54] .  Nutritional aspects involving bioactivity challenges Besides the product formulation and the challenges mentioned, the evaluation of phenolics’ bioacessibility or bioavailability is crucial and determinant in the field of functional food development, and to move toward achieving a zero-waste processing strategy. Without knowing phenolics’ behavior through digestion, there is no complete bioactivity study. Clinical trials are the most effective way to measure phenolics’ impact on individuals’ health. However, due to their costs, time, and ethical issues, simulated digestion studies such as harmonized INFOGEST have emerged as an important option. Despite digestion methods' harmonization, the calculation of phenolics’ bioacessibility involves different challenges such as the physicochemical characteristics of phenolic compounds; individual physiological parameters; time of ingestion; assay conditions (particularly extraction); processes employed; units and formula for calculation; food matrix analyzed, and phenolics fraction [55] .  Table 6  summarizes the bioaccessibility of phenolic acids from dietary fiber concentrates (DFCs) obtained after pressing vegetables (artichoke, red pepper, cucumber, and carrot). It is notable that the release of phenolic acids upon simulated colonic fermentation may be as significant as the content that may be released in the small intestine, but the percentage of phenolic acids upon the action of microbiota from fecal samples of healthy donors also varies greatly (0.3–52.7%), depending on the study material [56] . As an example of complexity, thermal pasteurization improved phenolics’ bioaccessibility from apple juice [57] , but anthocyanins from dark-purple eggplant were degraded with thermal process and digestion [58] ; both studies used the INFOGEST protocol. As mentioned, this is a harmonized digestion protocol created by a group of researchers to standardize in vitro  digestion procedures and make it comparable between different laboratories. On the other hand, varying behavior by soluble/insoluble phenolics fractions was observed in germinated mustard grains following INFOGEST [59] . Drinking wine after a meal showed better phenolic bioaccessibility values than before a meal [60] , but the aqueous extract from white wine Pinot noir  grape pomace provided a higher bioaccessibility of macromolecular complexed phenolics after simulated digestion by INFOGEST than the flour from the same material [61] . A simulated gastrointestinal digestion/Caco-2 cell model to predict bioaccessibility and intestinal permeability is also strongly encouraged, and although some studies report phenolics’ behavior through this system [62–64] , those data are usually scarce.   Conclusion Achieving zero-waste processing involves some further points that must be considered to close the circle within a circular economy framework: 1. the recovery of natural antioxidants from by-products is one of the starting points; 2. despite the range of research involving antioxidant phenolics, IBPs and antioxidants’ quantification and identification are still mostly neglected; 3. there is little available data about by-products’ safety, and data should be provided to make further advancements possible; 4. technological incorporation of such material is a challenge that has to be faced for functional food development; 5. some difficulties, including evaluation methods of IBPs’ bioaccessibility and biodisponibility, should also be considered. Zero-waste production strategy could be achieved if interdisciplinary efforts are seriously considered to make sustainable development objectives a reality.
