                  The public and the private sectors play fundamental roles in mobilizing capital to achieve the 2030 Agenda of Sustainable Development. In particular, developing countries can benefit from foreign direct investment (FDI) as a source of external financing in the private sector. This study aims to investigate whether FDI contributes to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Africa. We analyse a sample of 44 African countries regarding their SDG scores and apply a multivariate analysis and an ordered probit model. Our results indicate that the presence of foreign investors positively influences SDG scores. However, although FDI has a positive impact in areas such as basic infrastructure, clean water, sanitation, and renewable energy, some adverse environmental consequences may occur for host countries. In fact, the relationship between FDI and the probability of achieving SDG13 (Climate action) is negative. This study contributes to the literature on sustainable development and can be useful for decision-makers in developing investment plans to support the achievement of SDGs. Furthermore, we provide evidence of a positive influence of FDI on the SDGs, which might encourage further investments in Africa.

Despite being aware of the importance of this source of funding for developing countries, we have chosen to focus on FDI for several reasons. First, in our sample, FDI is of greater importance as a source of financing than ODA (41,772 vs. 23,332 million USD in 2017). Second, the Millenium Declaration encourages the increase in FDI, particularly in Africa, as FDI is fundamental for developing countries as it has positive effects on technology and employment creation (Asiedu, 2006; Martin and Anguelov, 2018). Finally, several studies have questioned the effectiveness of ODA in achieving economic growth due to corruption and poor governance in recipient countries (Martin and Anguelov, 2018).The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from FCT- Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (Portugal), national funding through research grant UID/SOC/04521/2019.

T he colours of the Africa SDG dashboard (SDGs Center for Africa and SDSN, 2018 , Figure 11) were converted into numbers: 3 for green (SDG achievement), 2 for yellow, 1 for orange, 0 for red (major challenges). All variables are means. Bold numbers show higher or equal mean variables compared to the African all sample mean. The SDG score represents the percentage of achievement for each SDG achievement. FDI is the average inflow of foreign direct investment over the 2014–2017 period. GDP is the real rate of gross domestic growth. POP is the natural logarithm of the population. GOVCONS is the final consumption expenditure of the general government as percentage of GDP. HEALTHEXP is the domestic health expenditure of the general government as a % of its total expenditure.

Charbel Jose Chiappetta Jabbour The public and the private sectors play fundamental roles in mobilizing capital to achieve the 2030 Agenda of Sustainable Development. In particular, developing countries can benefit from foreign direct investment (FDI) as a source of external financing in the private sector. This study aims to investigate whether FDI contributes to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Africa. We analyse a sample of 44 African countries regarding their SDG scores and apply a multivariate analysis and an ordered probit model. Our results indicate that the presence of foreign investors positively influences SDG scores. However, although FDI has a positive impact in areas such as basic infrastructure, clean water, sanitation, and renewable energy, some adverse environmental consequences may occur for host countries. In fact, the relationship between FDI and the probability of achieving SDG13 (Climate action) is negative. This study contributes to the literature on sustainable development and can be useful for decision-makers in developing investment plans to support the achievement of SDGs. Furthermore, we provide evidence of a positive influence of FDI on the SDGs, which might encourage further investments in Africa.   Graphical abstract Image 1       Keywords Foreign direct investment  Sustainable development goals  Africa  Developing countries    1 Introduction In 2015, the United Nations (UN) targeted 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) to be achieved by 2030: ending poverty; protecting the natural environment; and ensuring inclusive, just, and peaceful societies with prosperity for all by forging partnerships with people and the planet at its core (United Nations, 2015 ). The adoption of the 17 SDGs will require considerable investment needs that will create several challenges to the international community. While the public sector should play a fundamental role in mobilizing capital for investment in the SDG project, the private sector, including foreign direct investment (FDI), constitutes a fundamental source of external finance, although mostly for developing countries (UNCTAD, 2014 ). In particular, less developed countries (LDC) might have difficulties in achieving the SDGs because of their low level of socioeconomic development. Two-thirds of the LDC (34) are African countries. These countries lack financial resources to plan and carry out the SDGs; some of them are damaged by war; face natural occurrences, such as droughts; and show high levels of corruption. For those countries, FDI might be an opportunity to achieve the SDGs. FDI inflows to Africa were $42 billion in 2017, which was a 21% decline from 2016. This trend was mainly due to weak oil prices, deterioration of macroeconomic fundamentals, and the political uncertainty in certain countries. However, a recovery in commodity prices as well as advances in interregional cooperation through the signing of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement generated a slight recovery in FDI flows that reached $48 billion in 2018 (UNCTAD, 2018 ). FDI is perceived by developing countries as a source of economic development and modernisation and income growth and employment (OECD, 2002 ). While the majority of studies show a positive relationship between FDI and income growth, some authors provide evidence that FDI may have negative effects that lie mainly in social and environmental development (Iamsiraroj and Ulubaşoğlu, 2015 ; Reiter and Steensma, 2010 ). In this context, the concept of “Sustainable Investment” (SI) (Narula, 2012 ) should play a fundamental role in achieving all 17 SDGs. According to Narula (2012) , SI argues that FDI should comply with high environment, social, and governance standards to achieve sustainability in the three fundamental pillars of development: economic, social, and environmental. Although the existing research investigates the key role played by FDI on economic growth or environmental pollution, there is still a gap in literature regarding the influence of FDI on all the three pillars of sustainability simultaneously in order to guarantee a global sustainable development (Bebbington and Unerman, 2018 ; Hazelton, 2015 ; Christ and Burritt, 2017 ). In addition, our research respond to a call for a better understanding of the ability in achieving SDGs in less developed countries. Africa continues to be well behind the majority of most of the world regarding socioeconomic development and achievement of SDGs (SDGs Center for Africa and SDSN, 2018 ). The influence of FDI in these countries have been one of the main drivers of Africa’s growth (Kaulihowa and Adjasi, 2018 ). Therefore, our study help governments and policymakers in understanding the role that the presence of foreign investors may have on the achievement of SDGs in developing countries. Considering the above-mentioned motivations, the aim of this study is to address these gaps and provide evidence on the role of FDI in the achievement of SDGs in Africa and how this influence may differ among the 17 SDGs. With this aim in view, we analyse the SDG scores and trends of 44 African countries by region. In a first step, we conduct multivariate analyses to investigate the influence of FDI on the achievement of SDGs. In a second step, we apply an ordered probit model to examine the influence of FDI on the trend to achieve each SDG. The paper is organized as follows: first, we review the relevant literature; second, we introduce the research design; third, we present and discuss the empirical results of the descriptive statistics, multivariate analysis and the implications for future research. In the last section, we make our conclusions.  2 Literature review 2.1 African sustainable development Few studies exist that focus on sustainable development in Africa. In Sub-Saharan Africa, genuine savings, which is an indicator of national wealth, are negative in 49 out of 54 African countries. This is an unsustainable path with negative effects on welfare and development in the long run (Hamilton and Clemens, 1999 ; Bissoon, 2017 ). Also, after including education investments, the genuine savings remain negative or close to zero for African countries (Hamilton and Clemens, 1999 ). De Soysa and Neumayer (2005)  and Bissoon (2017)  find that higher levels of FDI result in higher growth rates in genuine savings. Furthermore, in Sub-Saharan Africa countries the growth in genuine savings is negatively influenced by income inequality, poor institutional quality, and wars as well as an overdependence on exports of natural resources such as oil (Bissoon, 2017 ). Dartey-Baah (2014)  links leadership with sustainable development and finds that in Africa sustainable development depends on effective leadership. More effective leadership in Africa would mean correcting various weaknesses in the political and administrative systems (Dartey-Baah, 2014 ). Dartey-Baah (2014)  describes transformational leadership as long-term oriented, visionary, and ethical process that involves stakeholders in the governance and that manages resources. Therefore, the three indicators of sustainable development are economic efficiency, social cohesion, and environmental responsibility (Dartey-Baah, 2014 ; World Bank, 2005 ). Since 2016, the aim of the Africa SDG index and dashboards report is to “help each African country identify priorities for action, understand key implementation challenges, and identify the gaps that must be closed to achieve the SDGs by 2030” (SDGs Center for Africa and SDSN, 2018 ). National and regional discussion and planning are key to achieving the SDGs. In many African countries, the economic and demographic data are collected with the help of international organisations, in particular household surveys and censuses (SDGs Center for Africa and SDSN, 2018 ). With only 37.8% of the data on official SDG indicators being available to African countries, there is a problem with the availability of data in Africa that points to the need for an Africa only report (UNECA, 2017 ). The results in the Africa report are therefore not comparable to the global SDG index report. For Africa, there are specific indicators but the overall 17 SDGs are named the same. In 2018, 51 African countries scored in 97 indicators across 17 SDGs between 0 and 100 (the worst and the best). Taking Ghana as an example, its 2018 Africa SDG score of 62 signifies that it is about 62% of the way to achieving its SDGs. The Africa SDG dashboard uses colours from green (achievement) to red (major challenges) to explain the SDG scores. Furthermore, the Africa SDG report includes a trend that is based on time series data and uses the same colours as the dashboard. On average, all countries show flat trends, which means little progress is being made in achieving the SDGs. Hereby the question arises what the key challenges are for African countries. In African countries, these are not only the lack of quality data or civil, governmental, and political coordination as well as service and support, but there is also a lack of adequate dedicated financial resources. However, the biggest challenge in Africa is the lack of political support (SDGs Center for Africa and SDSN, 2018 ).  2.2 Foreign direct investments and the SDGs According to the OECD (2008) , FDI includes initial transaction and subsequent capital flows between a resident entity in one economy and an entity in another economy. It provides a vehicle for creating direct, stable, and long-lasting links between economies (OECD, 2008 ). A large body of literature has investigated the impact of FDI on economic growth, but with mixed results. According to the neoclassical theory, FDI will benefit economic development in the host country through the inflow of capital, growth in the labour force, and enhancement of technological progress (Iamsiraroj and Ulubaşoğlu, 2015 ; Reiter and Steensma, 2010 ; Malikane and Chitambara, 2017 ). The majority of empirical studies provide evidence of a positive influence from FDI on economic growth. Using a sample of 69 developing countries over two decades, Borensztein et al. (1998)  show a positive effect from FDI on economic growth when the host country has a minimum threshold of human capital. More recently, Zhang (2014)  concludes that FDI has had large positive effects on China’s industrial performance. Using a panel of eight Southern African countries, Malikane and Chitambara (2017)  find a direct positive relationship between FDI and economic growth. However, some studies point out that FDI can also have negative consequences for the economy such as the crowding out of domestic investment or supporting an unfair competition that the foreign entities dominate (Kardos, 2014 ; Reiter and Steensma, 2010 ). Borensztein et al. (1998)  argues that when FDI inflows are motivated by profit from opportunities created by distorted incentives, the investment does not correspond to higher efficiency. Reiter and Steensma (2010)  conclude that there are several factors that can interact with FDI to determine its effect on economic development. With regard to the impact of FDI on environmental pollution, the literature also presents mixed results. The commonly known Pollution Haven Hypothesis  considers that the investment of high-income economies in countries with relatively weak environmental policies may be prejudicial for host countries as it transfers polluting technologies, goods, and services to those countries (Sarkodi and Strezov, 2019 ). With a case study in Pakistan, Khan et al. (2019)  confirm that higher economic growth involves dirty polluting industries. For the MENA region, Abdouli and Hammami (2018)  conclude that FDI can have a negative impact on environmental quality by accelerating economic growth. In contrast, according to the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis (Grossman and Krueger, 1995 ), economic growth originates in the first phase of environmental deterioration followed by a subsequent phase of improvement. Sarkodi and Strezov (2019)  confirm the validity of both hypotheses, but they depend on the groups of countries analysed. Bokpin (2017)  finds that FDI inflows contribute to the environmental degradation in Africa but that the role of governance and institutional policy prescriptions are fundamental in reducing this negative impact. In contrast, Ridzuan et al. (2017)  conclude for a sample based on Singapore that FDI inflows lead to higher economic growth and better environmental quality. While there is a large number of studies that investigate the impact of FDI on the economic development and environmental sustainability, less research is done with regard to the relationship of FDI and the achievement of SDGs with their three pillars: economic, social, and environmental. However, the establishment of SDGs requires a commitment at these different levels through evolving global partnerships between all countries and stakeholders who need to be together to achieve these goals and targets (Caiado et al., 2018 ). These goals set several challenges to governments as they aim to fight extreme poverty while ensuring economic, environmental, and social sustainable development (Choi et al., 2016 ). In order to achieve these goals, each nation has the primary responsibility of mobilising and raising financial resources, which in turn will promote new partnerships between the private and public sectors (Jayasooria, 2016 ). In this context, FDI plays a fundamental role in sustainable development and the achievement of SDG. Sachs (2012)  states that it is critical to involve the private sector in the process of achieving the SDG project. The FDI role gains importance in developing countries, as it is the largest source of external finance for these countries (UNCTAD, 2017 ). A significant partnership between low- and high-income countries is fundamental to effectively achieve sustainability challenges (Caiado et al., 2018 ). Developing countries are characterized by weak corporate governance mechanisms, high political and economic instability and a high degree of corruption, which constrain these countries from profiting from their natural resources (Iamsiraroj and Ulubaşoğlu, 2015 ). As the 17 SDGs aims to create the first global set of goals addressing all three pillars of sustainability (Horne et al., 2019 ), this study aims to extend previous literature in examining the influence of FDI on the SDG achievement in a holistic way, including the three dimensions of SDG project; the environmental, social and economic dimensions. Therefore, we address the following questions:- How does FDI influence the achievement of the SDGs in Africa?  - How does the influence of FDI differ among the 17 SDGs?    In addition to FDI, the United Nations  has long supported an increase in the Official Development Assistance (ODA) as a form of financing to promote economic growth in developing countries, with a particular focus on Africa (Addison et al., 2013 ; Martin and Anguelov, 2018 ). Despite being aware of the importance of this source of funding for developing countries, we have chosen to focus on FDI for several reasons. First, in our sample, FDI is of greater importance as a source of financing than ODA (41,772 vs. 23,332 million USD in 2017). Second, the Millenium Declaration encourages the increase in FDI, particularly in Africa, as FDI is fundamental for developing countries as it has positive effects on technology and employment creation (Asiedu, 2006 ; Martin and Anguelov, 2018 ). Finally, several studies have questioned the effectiveness of ODA in achieving economic growth due to corruption and poor governance in recipient countries (Martin and Anguelov, 2018 ).   3 Research design and data 3.1 Sample selection and data The original sample comprises information about FDI and macroeconomic variables from 54 African countries over the period from 2014 to 2017. Nevertheless, due to the lack of information for explanatory variables for all countries, our multivariate analysis decreases to 44 countries (Table A  in appendix). The FDI time series data is based on the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD) database. Regarding the SDGs, we use the Africa SDG index and the dashboard report from 2018 in three ways. First, we use the Africa SDG score as a general rank for the countries (SDGs Center for Africa and SDSN, 2018 , Table 6). A score of 66.1 out of 100 means that a country is 66.1 percent of the way to achieving their SDG. As this is already a scoring model, we furthermore transform the Africa SDG dashboard and the Africa SDG trends dashboard into a scoring model. Second, we transform the colours of the Africa SDG dashboard (SDGs Center for Africa and SDSN, 2018 , Figure 11) into numbers: 3 for green (SDG achievement), 2 for yellow, 1 for orange, 0 for red (major challenges) and no number for grey (no information). The SDG dashboard highlights the SDG, which performs worse and requires more actions by the countries. This data was used in Table 1  , for the descriptive statistics analysis. This coding helps us to understand the countries’ SDG index, because we measure the progress in each of the 17 goals. Third, we transform the trends dashboard (SDGs Center for Africa and SDSN, 2018 , Figure 12) into a scoring model: 4 for green and maintaining achievement of SDG (“score is level and trend remains at or above the level to achieve SDG”), 3 for green and on track (“score is increasing at the rate needed to achieve the SDG by 2030”), 2 for yellow meaning moderately increasing (“score is increasing at a rate above 50% of the required growth rate (between 2010 and 2030) but below the rate needed to achieve the SDG by 2030)”, 1 for orange meaning stagnating (“score remains stagnant or is increasing at a rate below 50% of the growth rate (between 2010 and 2030) needed to achieve the SDG by 2030”), 0 for red meaning decreasing (“decreasing score, i.e., country is moving in the wrong direction”), and no number for grey meaning no information about a trend (SDGs Center for Africa and SDSN, 2018 , p. 35). The trends are based on time series data between 1990 and 2018 but there is no data available for SDGs 10 and 12 (SDGs Center for Africa and SDSN, 2018 , Table 9). Regarding the data collection of the other variables, we used the World Bank database and information published by Freedom House (2018) .  3.2 Methodology To investigate how FDI contributes to the achievement of SDGs in Africa, we estimate the following model:(1) S D G  i   = β  0   + β  1   F D I  i    + β  2   G D P  i   + β  3   P O P  i   + β  4   G O V C O N S  i   + β  5   H E A L T H E X P  i   + β  6   M I L E X P  i   + β  7   F R E E I N D E X  i   + β  8   D R E G I O N S  i   + ε  i       in which i refers to the African country. FDI is the natural logarithm of the average inflow of foreign direct investment (Sarkodie and Strezov, 2019 ). Because the majority of existing literature considers FDI as relevant to sustainable development, we predict a positive coefficient for the variable FDI (β  1     >0). GDP is the average of the real rate of gross domestic growth. As economic development is positively related to sustainable development (Mainali et al., 2018 ), we predict a positive relationship between GDP and SDG. POP is the natural logarithm of the population for each country. Since higher population is negatively associated with GDP, we predict a negative relationship between POP and the achievement of SDGs (Aisen and Veiga, 2013 ). GOVCONS defines the final consumption expenditure of the general government as the percentage of the GDP. HEALTHEXP is the domestic health expenditure of the general government as the percentage of the total expenditure of the general government. MILEXP is the military expenditure as the percentage of the total expenditure of the central government. As the achievement of SDGs requires a substantial financing effort from the public sector, we include variables related with government expenditures and predict a positive relationship between these variables and the SDG index. FREEINDEX is the freedom rating obtained from the data on political and civil rights published by Freedom House (Malikane and Chitambara, 2017 ). The FREEINDEX is defined as the aggregate score that ranges from 0 (least free) to 100 (most free) (Freedom House, 2018 ). As a higher score indicates more freedom and civil rights, we predict a positive relationship between the FREEINDEX and the SDGs. DREGIONS are dummy variables for African regions that equal one by region: North, Central, West, East and South Africa. We use the annual average over the period from 2014 to 2017 for our macroeconomic variables (FDI, GDP, POP, GOVCONS, HEALTHEXP and MILEXP). This average helps to analyse the influence of these variables on the SDG score in 2018 (Malikane and Chitambara, 2017 ). Additionally, we estimate an ordered probit model with TREND as the dependent variable to analyse the influence of FDI on the progress of African countries in achieving each SDG (Williams, 2006 ).(2) P ( T R E N D  i   > j  )  = g ( X  i   β  j    )  = e x p ( α  j   + X  i   β  j    )   1 + e x p ( α  j   + X  i   β  j    )     j = 0,1,2,3,4     in which i refers to the African country, and X  i      is the vector of predictor variables used in equation (1)  and is described above (FDI, GDP, POP, GOVCONS, HEALTHEXP, MILEXP and FREEINDEX). TREND is an ordinal variable between zero and four that indicates whether countries are achieving each SDG. This variable is obtained from the transformation of trends dashboard into a scoring model from the lowest (0) to the highest (4) trend in achieving SDGs as follows:- 0: decreasing score, i.e. country is moving in the wrong direction;  - 1: score remains stagnant or is increasing at a rate below 50% of the growth rate (between 2010 and 2030) needed to achieve the SDG by 2030;  - 2: score is increasing at a rate above 50% of the required growth rate (between 2010 and 2030) but below the rate needed to achieve the SDG by 2030;  - 3: score is increasing at the rate needed to achieve the SDG by 2030;  - 4: score is level and trend remains at or above SDG achievement.    Equation (2)  is estimated for each goal, except for SDGs 10 and 12 for which there is no information.  3.3 Descriptive statistics In Table 1 , we provide descriptive statistics for FDI and the SDG scores as well as the real rate of gross domestic growth (GDP) and the control variables in equation (1) . We present the statistics by regions in Africa to understand the achievement of each goal by region. North Africa is the region that presents simultaneously the highest percentage level of achievement (61%) and the highest value of FDI (13,190 million USD). FDI in Morocco was up 23% in 2017 due to investment into new car technologies which contrasts with declines in FDI to the rest of North Africa (UNCTAD, 2018 ). North Africa has dominated FDI inflows in recent years, but with a general declining trend (Anayanwu and Yaméogo, 2015 ). Central Africa is the region that registers the lowest percentage of achievement (46.0%) and the lowest real rate of gross domestic growth (2.1%). The top investor economy in Africa has been the United States in the last few years (UNCTAD, 2018 ). In North Africa, all SDGs except 5 (Gender equality) and 12 (Responsible consumption and production) are above the African mean. However, SDG5 is above the African mean in East and South Africa and the results for SDG12 are the best in South Africa with a 31% achievement rate. “No poverty”, “Zero hunger”, “Good health and well-being”, “Gender equality”, “Affordable and clean energy”, “Industry, innovation and infrastructure”, “Life below water”, and “Peace, justice and strong institutions” are overall below 20% and therefore the SDGs with the most problems in being achieved by 2030. The mean for SDG3 (Good health and well-being) is under 10% in Central, West, and East Africa. North and South Africa show higher results for SDG 3 but also have higher expenditures in health (HEALTHEXP) than other African regions. South Africa scores very low in SDG1 (No poverty) and SDG2 (Zero hunger) and is furthermore above the African mean in SDG10 (Reduced inequalities), SDG13 (Climate action), and SDG15 (Life on land). In particular, SDG13 (Climate action) shows achievement above 50% in all African regions except for South Africa. However, in South Africa SDG4 (Quality education) and SDG11 (Sustainable cities and communities) are above the African mean. Central Africa scores over 50% in SDG15 (Life on land) and under 10% in SDGs 1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 16 and 17. West Africa scores even worse with achievements under 10% in SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9 and 14. East Africa only scores low (under 10%) for three SDGs (3, 7, 9). Comparing the SDG results to the expenditures, we can see that higher FDI and higher consumption and expenditure by the government lead to better results in North and South Africa. Fig. 1   denotes the results from the SDG trend points and SDG trend percentages for the achievement of all regions. All African regions seem to work on SDG13 (Climate action). In addition, North Africa shows positive trends for SDGs 1 (No poverty), 3 (Good health and well-being), 9 (Industry, innovation and infrastructure), and 15 (Life on land). East and West Africa also show positive trends for SDG15 (Life on land). South Africa improves SDG5 (Gender equality) and SDG9 (Industry, innovation and infrastructure), while East Africa also focuses on SDG5 (Gender equality) and SDG8 (Decent work and economic growth). Furthermore, South and West Africa seem to develop a partnership to reach the goals (SDG17). The average African percentage of achievement by points in the scoring model is: 1-No poverty (41%), 2-Zero hunger (39%), 3-Good health and well-being (44%), 4-Quality education (34%), 5-Gender equality (48%), 6-Clean water and sanitation (29%), 7-Affordable and clean energy (32%), 8-Decent work and economic growth (44%), 9-Industry, innovation and infrastructure (47%), 11-Sustainable cities and communities (23%), 13-Climate action (86%), 14-Life below water (29%), 15-Life on land (50%), 16-Peace, justice and strong institutions (28%), 17-Partnership for the goals (43%). The trends are based on time series data between 1990 and 2018 but there is no data available for SDGs 10 and 12 (SDGs Center for Africa and SDSN, 2018 , Table 9). Table B  (in appendix) shows the Pearson correlations between the SDG score and the different variables. As predicted, FDI and FREEINDEX are positive and significantly correlated with SDG. The correlation values between POP and FDI and HEALTHEXP and GOVCONS are above 0.50. To control for multicollinearity, we compute the variance inflation factors (VIFs) and find that they are less than 3.55, which means that there is no problem at this level.   4 Results and discussion Table 2   provides the results from the multivariate analysis regarding the influence of FDI on the achievement of SDG. Our results show that an increase in FDI leads to an increase in the SDG scores that indicates foreign investors play a fundamental role in the achievement of SDG in developing countries. The coefficient for the variable FDI is positive and statistically significant at the 5% level (β1 = 0.015). Regarding the variables related to public financing such as GOVCONS, HEALTHEXP, or MILEXP, we conclude that these variables do not have a significant effect on achievement, which reinforces the role of foreign investors in ensuring sustainability in developing countries. Our findings also indicate that in countries with greater political and civil rights (FREEINDEX), the SDG score is higher. The coefficient for FREEINDEX is positive and statistically significant at the 5% level (β7  = 0.131). This coefficient might indicate that in more stable countries it is possible to achieve greater economic, social, and environmental sustainability. Regarding the differences between regions, we can conclude that the role of FDI on SDG achievement is higher in North Africa. Despite the decline of FDI in Africa, countries such as Egypt and Morocco continue to be important recipients of FDI in Africa (UNCTAD, 2018 ). In contrast, the role of FDI is lower in East Africa, because the coefficient for the interaction between FDI and EASTAFRICA is negative and statistically significant at the 1% level. East Africa presents the lowest level of FDI for the period from 2014 to 2017. Fig. 2   shows that about 81% of the countries are at or above SDG 13 Climate action, consistent with the importance given currently to this SDG. For SDG 7 (Affordable and clean energy), SDG 14 (Life below water) and SDG 16 (Peace, justice and strong institutions), African countries are performing above the rate needed to achieve the SDG by 2030. 0 is decreasing score (country is moving in the wrong direction); 1 is when score remains stagnant or is increasing at a rate below 50% of the growth rate (between 2010 and 2030) needed to achieve the SDG by 2030; 2 is when the score is increasing at a rate above 50% of the required growth rate (between 2010 and 2030) but below the rate needed to achieve the SDG by 2030; 3 is when score is increasing at the rate needed to achieve the SDG by 2030; and 4 is when the score is level and trend remains at or above SDG achievement. Table 3   presents the results for the ordered probit regression on the influence of FDI on the SDG trends. The results in Table 3  indicate that FDI increases the probability of better trends for SDG 1 (No poverty), SDG 7 (Affordable and clean energy), SDG 9 (Industry, innovation and infrastructure), and SDG 14 (Life below water). These findings are in line with the literature that provides evidence of a positive influence from FDI on economic growth (Borensztein et al., 1998 ; Zhang, 2014 ; Malikane and Chitambara, 2017 ). These results also show the importance of FDI in developing countries for the investment in economic transformation such as basic infrastructure, clean water, sanitation, and renewable energy (UNCTAD, 2014 ). Regarding the trend for SDG 16 (Peace, justice and strong institutions), our results show that FDI has a positive influence. This is in line with the evidence that the presence of foreign investors promotes good governance among governments and domestic sectors, which Mathur and Chatterjee (2003)  discussed at the Global Forum on International Investment. In contrast, the relationship between FDI and the trend for SDG 13 (Climate action) is negative. This finding is consistent with the commonly known Pollution Haven Hypothesis  that says that the investment of high-income economies in countries with relatively weak environmental policies may be prejudicial to the host countries as it transfers polluting technologies, goods, and services to those countries (Sarkodi and Strezov, 2019 ). Finally, as an additional test, we add the control variable ODA to both equations. Untabulated results show that our prior findings remain unchanged and the variable ODA is not statistically significant. Mobilizing capital for investment in the SDGs constitutes a huge challenge for all nations in order to achieve the 2030 agenda, especially in developing countries. Beyond the public investment, the private sector, including FDI, is a fundamental source of external finance. Kardos (2014)  highlights the importance of FDI for sustainable development; Melane-Lavado et al. (2018)  point out that there is a lack of knowledge regarding the FDI-sustainability relationship; and Shahbaz et al. (2019)  conclude that the relationship between FDI and CO2  emissions is in line with the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis. Our paper contributes to this strand of literature by analysing the impact of FDI on green growth and sustainable development (Kardos, 2014 ). Beyond the economic dimension, we also analyse the influence of FDI on environmental and social aspects. Considering that the SDG score is a global measure, our findings emphasize the importance of the three pillars needed to achieve sustainable development (economic, environmental, and social dimensions). Our results show policymakers that FDI has a positive impact on developing countries in areas such as basic infrastructure, clean water, sanitation, and renewable energy. Therefore, in order to maintain the continuous improvement of those SDG, it is essential for African countries to open to outside world and formulate policies to attract foreign investment. However, the potential environmental consequences of such investments should be carefully considered in government policy. Our findings have profound implications for countries, in general, and for African countries, in particular, in their intention to balance between economic development and environmental sustainability. On the other hand, considering that the actions each country have taken to achieve the SDGs are country-specific (Salvia et al., 2019 ), our results highlight the importance of the presence of foreign investors in promoting good governance in host countries, especially in emerging markets. Finally, this study should be also helpful for international organisations that promote foreign investment. Our results highlight the need to create better policies and to promote investment for SDG achievement in a holistic approach.  5 Conclusions Bebbington and Unerman (2018)  underline the role of research in the pursuit of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and in the promotion of the accounting for sustainability. Because FDI has a decisive role in achieving transformational global development, we analyse whether it influences the achievement of SDGs in a sample of 44 African countries. The results show that foreign investors play a fundamental role in this achievement in African countries, and in particular in North Africa. The level of political and civil rights is relevant to explaining SDG scores as more stable countries can achieve greater economic, social, and environmental sustainability. Our results further indicate the importance of FDI for SDGs in developing countries in relation to basic infrastructure, clean water, sanitation, and renewable energy. However, these investments may have some adverse consequences regarding climate actions. This paper contributes to the global debate on the SDGs in developing countries in several ways. First, as far as we know, this is the first paper to analyse the role of FDI on the achievement of SDGs in general, and on the achievement of each SDG. Second, our sample is based on African countries. Studies about Africa offer both context-specific and context-bound research, which may be useful not only in the African context, but also in other emerging countries (Kolk and Rivera-Santos, 2016 ). Our study is subject to some limitations. The non-availability and reliability of the data on African countries not only reduced our sample from 54 countries to 44 countries but also did not allow the estimation of equation (2)  for SDGs 10 (Reduced inequalities) and 12 (Responsible consumption and production). Furthermore, we can expect that FDI is more likely to flow to countries that score higher on the SDG index and that have more data available.
