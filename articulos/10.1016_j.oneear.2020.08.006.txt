                  The diversity of local conditions across regions has led to numerous challenges and opportunities for the implementation of global sustainability frameworks such as the Sustainable Development Goals. A grassroots transformative change led by local communities, cities, and businesses can offer a promising approach for achieving sustainability, tailored to the unique conditions of each context. Drawing on a systematic review of scientific and policy experiences, we explore some of the major challenges in local sustainability such as disagreements on local priorities, competing interests among various cohorts of stakeholders, and the risks posed by future uncertainties. We propose a transdisciplinary agenda based on the effective integration of computational approaches with genuine stakeholder engagement to mitigate these challenges. The proposed agenda is crucial for mobilizing collaborative efforts that enhance co-learning between scientists and stakeholders in the pursuit of sustainability across scales.

Figure 1 The Nine Top Areas in Publications Related to Achieving Sustainability at a Local Scale (2015–2019) Word clouds represent the frequency of the top 50 words allocated to each area. The areas are named on the basis of the most descriptive (often the most frequent) words in relation to the 17 SDGs (e.g., “water” is related to SDG 6). There are also less frequent (descriptive) words in each area whose associated SDGs were not included in the area name as they were less significant. The size of each word-cloud is proportional to the share of publications related to the respective area. The (rounded) percentage of the share of publication in each area is shown in area names. The font size represents the frequency of the word within each area. Words are color-coded according to the SDG legend bar (e.g., “energi,” related to SDG 7, is gold). Generic words that can be related to multiple SDGs (e.g., environment, resource) appear in gray. The SDG icons are the courtesy of the UN SDGs Communications materials.    Figure 2 The Three Conceptual Pillars in Our Proposed Transdisciplinary Agenda for Localizing Sustainability The pillars show the aims (bold font) and the questions to address (same color, at the bottom). The pillars also embody the processes to be in place for each aim. The small arrows show how the pillars are inter-related.    Figure 3 An Example of an Adaptive Plan for Localizing Sustainability The roadmap represents adaptive pathways to achieve the localized goals under uncertainty. The right–hand side SDGs represent the priorities of the local region. The timelines at the bottom show three major uncertain driving forces of the future that might disrupt the effectiveness of pathways from now to 2050. The envelope plot in the background shows the exploration of driving forces, with increasing uncertainties from now to the future.    Figure 4 A Tally of the Votes for the SDGs of Greatest Importance to the Community from the Listening Post Activity The number of the votes for each SDG is shown inside each column. Grayed out columns are the SDGs that received fewer votes and are therefore of lower local priority. SDGs 10, 14, 16, and 17 received no votes and are omitted from this figure.

A grassroots transformative change led by local communities, cities, and businesses can offer a promising approach for achieving sustainability, tailored to the unique conditions of each context. Drawing on a systematic review of scientific and policy experiences, we explore some of the major challenges in local sustainability such as disagreements on local priorities, competing interests among various cohorts of stakeholders, and the risks posed by future uncertainties. We propose a transdisciplinary agenda based on the effective integration of computational approaches with genuine stakeholder engagement to mitigate these challenges. The proposed agenda is crucial for mobilizing collaborative efforts that enhance co-learning between scientists and stakeholders in the pursuit of sustainability across scales.   Graphical Abstract       The Sustainable Development Goals represent humanity's shared ambitious aspirations in the age of Anthropocene. The successful attainment of these goals goes beyond national and international efforts. We discuss that grassroots sustainability initiatives are great opportunities that can give effect to the global and national initiatives through addressing place-specific needs. We propose a transdisciplinary agenda for localizing sustainability in the pursuit of global goals.   Keywords sustainability  adaptation  uncertainty  city  participatory  model  local scale  transdisciplinary    Introduction The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) under the UN 2030 Agenda represent a shared vision for global development toward a sustainable economy, society, and environment.1   Governments have started to coordinate national efforts and evaluate performance against the SDGs.2   Recent studies, however, have recognized how challenging it is to meet the SDGs at the national level,3  , 4   especially without active engagement with subnational stakeholders.5   Public participation and collective action by local stakeholders (e.g., city councils, community groups, individuals, private businesses, local authorities, civil society organizations) have long been recognized as key determining factors in achieving inclusive sustainable development across almost all major global agendas.1  , 6–8   Despite this, we argue that the level of adoption and effectiveness of local, bottom-up initiatives must be urgently and rapidly increased if we are to meet the ambitious 2030 targets defined by the SDGs. Connecting the broad and abstract global SDGs with locally specific actions requires tailored sustainability programs that better account for the local environment, socio-economic circumstances, and a mosaic of diverse aspirations and interests of social groups, organizations, and individuals.9   A bottom-up, grassroots engagement with the SDGs, whether it is through local communities, cities, or businesses, can be an opportunity to enable synergies and mutual benefits between global and national aspirations, with place-based needs and priorities. We previously termed this as Local Agenda 2030.10   Given the criticality of such local agendas, a nuanced and systematic investigation of the role of grassroots initiatives in achieving the SDGs from the bottom-up is still underexplored.5  , 11   We present a systematic analysis of influential attempts to promote local sustainability, framed by the SDGs. From a critical analysis of recent trends in the literature, we then identify and synthesize a transdisciplinary research agenda for accomplishing the global SDGs from the bottom-up. This agenda aims to promote co-learning across scientific disciplines to better incorporate (potentially divergent) stakeholder views and values and to better cope with the future uncertainties in localizing sustainability. We support the proposed agenda by several examples from successful case studies.  Local Sustainability in Research and Policy Local initiatives have tackled the issue of sustainability in a variety of diverse and innovative ways.5   Understanding the way forward for local sustainability action requires learning from these past experiences and their challenges and opportunities.12   We synthesized the extensive literature of this area in the following overviews of key scientific research and policy initiatives for localizing sustainability. Overview of the Scientific Research To better understand the diversity of local sustainability in the research arena, we undertook a systematic search of scholarly publications from the initiation of the UN Agenda 2030 in 2015 up to and including the year 2019 in the Scopus database. The search resulted in a total of more than 7900 articles, books, and book chapters (Experimental Procedures ). We used a text-mining algorithm called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)13   to create a meta-synthesis of qualitative insights across the abstracts of the documents into multiple areas. Each area contains correlated keywords that can be linked to the SDG goals and indicators (Experimental Procedures ). The areas and their keywords (Figure 1  ) reveal the extent that local sustainability has been discussed in the context of different SDGs. While text mining is useful for obtaining an overview of many publications, it does not provide detailed insights about their aim, research methods, and results. The latter requires an in-depth but unavoidably selective literature review approach.14   Nine areas emerged from our analysis that can be described based on their keywords in relation to the 17 SDGs. Each area has a certain share of publications (percentages in Figure 1 ), with different frequencies of descriptive keywords (represented by word size in Figure 1 ). The emerging areas can lead to two insights about the state of local sustainability in research. First, keywords related to sustainable cities (SDG 11) are widely present across three popular areas with a 20%, 15%, and 13% share of publications. This shows that local sustainability has been discussed much more in cities and urban areas, focusing on the role of inclusive and sustainable cities and reducing the environmental impacts of cities (e.g., through expanding public transport networks15  ). The SDGs can inform public participation in cities and urban communities by providing a common framework through which locally meaningful and legitimate actions can be connected and contribute to national and global agendas. An example is the way in which clean energy for vulnerable suburban communities can improve air quality in cities, while contributing to a reduced risk of non-communicable diseases, such as lung and heart disease (SDG 3) and its associated economic burdens at the national scale (SDG 1).16   Second, supporting institutions, policies, and strategic partnerships with stakeholders (SDGs 16 and 17) are other crucial keywords that are present in multiple popular areas, with 20%, 15%, and 14% share of publications. SDGs 16 and 17 can play a key role in promoting sustainable development through local initiatives.17   Effective and just policies and multi-stakeholder partnerships can underpin a sound governance structure for a balanced realization of other goals. The literature in this part has extensively discussed the expansion of participatory, inclusive, and representative approaches for engaging citizens in decision making and developing more effective and just institutions in sustainable development.18  , 19    Overview of Policy Initiatives In addition to the scientific literature, an active role for local stakeholders in achieving sustainability has been advocated in policy initiatives since the late 1980s.9   One of the earliest and most widely known is Local Agenda 21,20   which was a key component of the UN global action plan for sustainable development. The extensive adoption of Local Agenda 21 in more than 6400 local authorities spanning 113 countries21   demonstrated how local multi-stakeholder groups can facilitate the implementation of global goals through intermediary institutions, and how cities, businesses, and communities—as a level of governance close to the people—can contribute significantly in raising awareness and promoting sustainable development. The initial experience with Local Agenda 21 was followed by many globally initiated attempts for local sustainable development. We showcased a selection of key initiatives, identified through a snowball search procedure (S5) in the public domain. We divided the identified initiatives on the basis of their focal point at the local scale that could be communities and local governments, cities, and businesses (Table 1  ). For each initiative, we summarized the purpose, approach, intended local impact, time frame, original geography, and an example of their outreach to better understand the evolution process of policy initiatives in different dimensions. From Table 1 , we can conclude that past policy initiatives have evolved over time in multiple dimensions. The first evolving dimension has been around the level of resources for implementation. Early initiatives mostly remained at a high level, highlighting the urgency (e.g., Local Agenda 2120  ) and navigating the overarching process (e.g., Planning for Climate Change30  ) to localize sustainability endeavors. This was followed by initiatives that attempted to respond to this urgency through supporting elements, such as implementation toolkits (e.g., Toolkit for Millennium Development Goals [MDGs] Localization,23   SDG Local and Urban Governance Dashboard27  ) for local-level data access, local financing, and knowledge sharing. The second dimension has been the evolution of their agendas, that is the priorities of initiatives and the way to achieve them. Early initiatives (e.g., Local Agenda 2120  ) often proposed non-binding, collaborative frameworks for integrating global agendas into existing local government development plans, serving mostly socio-economic-political priorities. This gradually changed to bottom-up initiatives that were initiated from grassroots businesses and communities, with a balanced representation of not only socio-economic-political priorities, but also environment goals (e.g., UN Global Compact,37   SDG Compass35  ). The third dimension has been around the expansion of the sectoral scope from capacity building in local authorities and government agencies (e.g., Local Agenda 2120  ) to facilitating multi-sectoral collaborations across scales with communities (e.g., Local, 203025  ), cities (e.g., The New Urban Agenda8  ), and businesses (e.g., SDG Compass35  ).  Lessons Learned The overview of previous scientific research and policy initiatives can help identify gaps and opportunities for local sustainability. First, although local sustainability has been widely acknowledged in past research (>7,900 publications found), the overview of the literature in Figure 1  shows that this topic has not been adopted equally across all SDGs. For example, clean energy (SDG 7) has been more successful than others (9% of publications) in defining and incorporating effective bottom-up initiatives (e.g., through promoting investment mechanisms in renewable energy and energy efficiency in cities). However, topics such as access to basic services within households and empowering the marginalized members of communities in sustainability (SDGs 3, 5, and 10) has been less discussed (7% of publications). This suggests a need for an effective approach to incorporate and operationalize local sustainability, more consistently across all SDGs. There is an important role for institutions, policies, and strategic partnerships in shaping this approach, which highlights the importance of transdisciplinary efforts that can incorporate different views and perspectives and connect various (academic and non-academic) stakeholder groups through effective partnerships. Second, global frameworks and their downscaled regional and local guideline materials were essential for creating the inspiration, capacity building, partnerships, and learning at the local level (e.g., Local Agenda 2120  ). Downscaling of global frameworks, however, needs to be supported by empowering local actors (e.g., communities, cities, and businesses) to act on their own terms, as observed in more recent initiatives.8   This could eventually lead to locally supported and meaningful goals and indicators, in moving toward sustainability. Successfully downscaling global frameworks and empowering local actors is not easy in practice because of multiple knowledge gaps and practical challenges. In the following section, we analyze some of these critical knowledge gaps and challenges to improve the design and empowerment of local sustainability aligned with global agendas.   Practical Challenges and Knowledge Gaps We analyzed some of the key challenges that have led to unsuccessful implementations of local sustainability. We started by looking at previous evaluations12  , 38  , 39   of Local Agenda 21 as a widely adopted program across many local governments and communities. It was instructive to revisit these past evaluations and to learn from them in identifying current challenges. We then went beyond case-specific evaluations and generalized the knowledge gaps and challenges to a broader local sustainability context. The clarification of these gaps and challenges revealed a series of research priorities toward a transdisciplinary agenda for local sustainability in the next section. Dealing with Goals Insensitive to Local Priorities Most of the global goals and indicators, such as the SDGs are formulated at a highly aggregated level and are often measured with national and transnational targets. These high-level goals and indicators are less sensitive to specific contextual priorities and can be ambiguous or insignificant for measuring and monitoring the achievement of success at the local level.40   The challenge of high-level goals can be compounded by top-down approaches in the implementation of plans and programs where the initiation process is largely centrally coordinated. This challenge was observed in the initiation process of Local Agenda 21, which was largely technocratic, with most of the responsibility to design and implement the programs falling into a specific department within local authorities.39   This led to a lack of genuine participation from community members throughout the implementation efforts.41   For example, in implementing Local Agenda 21 in Malaysia,42   the over-reliance on external consultants and the lack of transparency of the consultation process significantly hampered genuine public participation. Consultation meetings were also primarily organized by invitation rather than by voluntary participation, leading to the wider public remaining uninformed about the program and the ways in which they could contribute. The result was an imbalanced representation by government officials dominating the community members, and limited buy-in and engagement from community members throughout the process. Downscaling of global frameworks, such as the SDGs, should be instead participatory and based in communities. A bottom-up approach can ensure a more nuanced investigation of the diverse priorities within different regions and can better reflect on local contextual variations in defining goals, targets, and their indicators.9   The downscaling of global goals should also go beyond their disaggregation into component parts on the basis of spatial location, age cohort, socio-economic status, or gender. For instance, the explicit incorporation of indigenous knowledge and input is key to devising goals.43   A meaningful downscaling should entail identifying, prioritizing, and translating global (or national) priorities into a set of locally relevant goals and targets with measurable indicators.44   Such localized and measurable goals, targets, and indicators can create clearer benchmarks for formalizing commitment and enabling local government and institutional arrangements to monitor the progress.  Disagreement on What Is to Be Achieved Community is not a homogeneous and cohesive social unit. There are diverse and often competing social, economic, and environmental priorities among stakeholder groups within local regions and between local and national (or global) players.45   This is equally evident in both a developed and developing world context, albeit with unique and diverse challenges depending on the specific country and institutional context.46   The case of Local Agenda 21 in Vienna39   was an example of how the differences gave rise to political dynamics and power/resource imbalances at the local level. Vienna's Local Agenda 21 Project Group's plan to preserve a public recreation area was met with opposition from a group of city officials, national ministries, and private development companies who were involved in the redevelopment of the area. Consequently, the implementation of the initiative consciously avoided difficult deliberation of trade-offs within the community and settled for compromised programs that did not adequately address the tensions between priority issues of different cohorts. The diversity and competition in this case and other similar local examples can be compounded by the divergence between local governance processes and aggregated, homogenized national (and international) institutional arrangements.47   Such divergent priorities and arrangements create a collective action dilemma where local actors cannot easily work with each other, let alone with national and global authorities, toward a shared desired future. Coping with this challenge requires difficult deliberation for compromising between multiple agendas and moving toward consensus on issues that matter most to communities. Consensus, however, is an ideal that is unlikely to be fully reached in the context of the SDGs. We therefore need tools that help us navigate diverse agendas, tensions, struggles, and controversies, not with a view of resolving them, but with a view of ensuring all voices are heard equally.48   This requires, first of all, a shift from a state-centric approach in decision-making processes to multi-stakeholder and cross-scale cooperation and participatory planning, using tools such as community needs analysis, community visioning, and round table discussions.38   The human analytical capacity obtained through these participatory processes might overlook complex interlinkages between the environmental, economic, and social aspects of sustainability and can also fail to comprehend the broader effects of actions, often leading to sub-optimal outcomes.49   Therefore, the robust trade-offs among competing priorities also require effective coupling of participatory with novel computational approaches that can simulate and reproduce the interactions of conflicting, inter-connected priorities in highly complex socio-ecological systems.50   Past research has studied complex trade-offs through a range of computational techniques, such as network analysis,51   dynamic modeling,4   and exploratory modeling.52   These and other similar techniques need to be further used and tested within the SDGs framework to enhance robust local-scale decision making.  Lack of Preparation in the Face of Future Uncertainties The future is uncertain,52   and this is reflected in global (e.g., socio-economic, climatic) trends as well as in local factors (e.g., the continuity of financial resources, the stability of state political support, the negotiation around what matters in local contexts53  ). Under these uncertainties, local sustainability plans developed with a limited monitoring of ongoing change and a static set of actions that are based on future predictions would fail to deliver their intended outcomes and could potentially result in undesired consequences.52   Past local initiatives have been largely unprepared for coping with uncertainty and adequately monitoring changes for contingency response. In the example of Local Agenda 21, the pressure applied to local authorities from central and regional governments to produce local programs was not accompanied by adequate resources and support to maintain the effectiveness of actions in the long term. In other words, there was a disproportionate emphasis on the design and preparation phase of the initial programs, compared with those of monitoring and responding to potential uncertainties during implementation.41   An effective approach to coping with uncertainty should question local actors' well-established assumptions and account for future contingencies. Here, computational and simulation models within an exploratory setting54   have assisted decision making under uncertainty for decades. The exploratory approach can enable the investigation of transient future scenarios that are sampled systematically across uncertainties.50  , 55   Coping with uncertainties also requires the evaluation and monitoring of change unfolding over time, offering cues to stakeholders about when the plan might diverge from the targets, and anticipating actions to respond to potential divergences. Such an adaptive approach has been widely discussed and implemented in the context of backcasting, experimenting, and monitoring to ensure that all necessary measures are taken for achieving long-term goals.56     A Transdisciplinary Agenda for Local Sustainability What roles can researchers play in helping local communities, cities, and businesses accomplish their sustainability ambitions in the face of existing challenges? In the light of existing literature, we propose a transdisciplinary agenda supported with examples of the successful development and empowerment of local sustainability initiatives. Our proposed agenda is designed to promote co-learning and collaboration across different scientific disciplines, and among science, decision making, and the public (Figure 2  ). Conceptual Pillars in Localizing Sustainability Localizing sustainability requires transformative change which can overcome the tendency for incrementalism that perpetuates the status quo. The transformative change should be navigated through long-term goals, reflecting desired outcomes (i.e., the successful future for a community, city, or business). Such goals represent collective social, environmental, and economic ambitions of a society toward which local actors should be transitioning.57   Transformative change could be realized through a series of short-term (low regret) and long-term (high investment) actions to achieve ambitious goals. Framing goals and actions in a local context is a process fraught with tensions and divergence of priorities to be negotiated in terms of power relationships between various stakeholders.58   This requires researchers to engage in a deliberative learning process with societal actors to reflect on existing goals and current actions, as well as to jointly frame new ones via genuine stakeholder engagement from the bottom-up.59   The joint framing of context-specific goals and actions helps to mobilize coordinated efforts that are aware of environmental limits as well as being socially desirable and actionable. The effectiveness of actions and the achievement of localized goals are likely to be disrupted under potential future instabilities (e.g., technological disruption, political volatility, ecological disasters). These uncertainties need to be carefully factored into decisions.52   Going forward in time, knowledge about future events can become even more contested, and therefore uncertainty around these events and their consequences for the achievement of long-term goals can be exacerbated. Localizing sustainability requires the evaluation of disruptive scenarios through a careful consideration of influential but uncertain factors—whether at local, national, or global level—some of which can be informed through deliberation with stakeholders.60   The evaluation also needs a systematic investigation and analysis of the efficacy of actions in the attainment of long-term goals and for making difficult trade-offs between conflicting priorities. A priori  assessment of uncertainties and their disruptive consequences can pave the way for understanding the causes underlying potential failures (i.e., stress testing) and identify ways to mitigate their impacts in the future.61   Achieving long-term goals under uncertainty needs beyond single, one-off actions and requires an adaptive plan, i.e., a roadmap of time-specific, bounded actions that can guide local actors over time. Such a roadmap can inform which actions to implement, when to implement them, and how to support them with additional contingency measures to survive future instabilities. Sustainability science and development studies have proposed the concepts of pathways62   and adaptability63   to enhance the capacity for adjusting responses under changing conditions through deliberation, learning, and negotiation.64   Accordingly, pathways entail effective sequences of short- and long-term actions that can shape the desired future, given differing local contexts.62  , 65   Pathways can also be adaptive to future uncertainties. They include signposts to monitor changing circumstances and signal when the system nears a tipping point. Tipping points represent both negative (e.g., an environmental disaster) and positive (e.g., a transformative discovery or solution) thresholds66   where the current actions are no longer effective and new actions are required.56   As time progresses, and as local actors' knowledge or the surrounding environment changes, an adaptive plan can help them to proactively navigate alternative courses of actions toward achieving long-term sustainability goals. The outcome of this process is an adaptive plan for localizing sustainability. As an illustrative example of an adaptive plan, we consider a hypothetical regional agricultural community, evaluating the implementation of the SDG framework over the 2030 and 2050 time horizons. In this community, localizing global SDGs leads to the identification of three major local priorities: the improvement of agricultural productivity (SDG 2), sustainable irrigation water-use (SDG 6), and maintaining regional ecosystems (SDG 15). Unpredictable futures might disrupt the achievement of these goals. The major influential but uncertain driving forces are frequent droughts, increasing bushfires, and improving agricultural productivity. The exploration of these driving forces leads to the discovery of future scenarios and potential vulnerabilities that lie ahead of the community's actions. The knowledge obtained from goal setting and uncertainty analysis is carefully factored into the development of a roadmap pathway that can guide local actors along their way in achieving sustainability (Figure 3  ). Starting from the current situation, goals begin to be missed after a few years (the first tipping point) because of disruptive environmental events (i.e., prolonged drought). Following the current plan, there are four options. The use of “climate resilient crops” or taking “reforestation and conservation” measures could achieve the goals by 2030 and 2050 in all drought, bushfire, agricultural productivity scenarios. However, these are long-term solutions with high upfront investment, which do not necessarily meet the community's immediate needs. A short-term, low regret action supported by the local community is implementing a “payment incentive” for the adoption of resilient agricultural crops. With this decision taken, a tipping point will be reached by 2030 and a shift to an alternative option will be needed. If “reduce water demand” is chosen after 2030, there will need to be another shift to other actions by 2040 in the worst-case scenario. In all other scenarios, the local goals will be achieved by 2050 through the combination of pathways that can remain adaptive to future potential instabilities, signaled through the monitoring of the environment. The conceptual pillars of local sustainability, leading to an adaptive plan, should be co-created in a transdisciplinary effort67–69   and via genuine engagement of researchers with local stakeholders. Through co-creation, researchers can combine participatory human deliberation with computational analytical modeling70   and can integrate the nuances of human factors55  , 71   into processes for localizing sustainability. In the following subsections, we explain how this co-creation can be operationalized through transdisciplinary innovation with supporting examples from real-world case studies.  A Participatory Downscaling of Global Goals Stakeholder engagement through participatory processes, such as workshops can have an important role in defining and opening up inclusive dialogues, translating global goals (e.g., the SDGs) at the local level,11   and enabling state and non-state stakeholders to capitalize on synergies and negotiate trade-offs among their divergent priorities.72   Existing global agendas, such as the SDGs, could inform this process by framing what sustainability could mean to societal actors. These high-level agendas can help in leveraging internal resources and capacities by guiding the alignment of the local needs with national and global priorities. To further explain the downscaling of global SDGs at the local level, we use a successful case study in an Australian post-agricultural community. The case study is about a philanthropically supported program, called the Local SDGs, aimed at developing robust pathways toward future-proofing Australian communities and enabling people and nature to thrive. One of the case studies of the program is Forrest, a small rural township on the border of the Great Otway National Park in Victoria, southern Australia. This study area had recently transitioned from an economy structured around forestry and dairy farming to one based on eco-tourism. This transition increased pressure on local housing and highlighted inadequacies in local waste management and sewage treatment. Researchers, in collaboration with the community and local government facilitators, used a range of engagement activities to discover the sustainability ambitions of the local residents, their concerns, and their ideas for locally specific ways to achieve their objectives, aligned with the global SDGs. To effectively engage with the local community, a stall was set up outside of the township's General Store to canvass local residents' opinions and conduct a poll on which SDGs were most important (Figure 4  ). This participatory activity, called a listening post, introduced the public to the concept of the SDGs and polled those most important for the future of their community. A participatory activity involving a range of community stakeholders called a kitchen table discussion, facilitated a reflection on the collected votes from the public and further expressed their hopes and fears for the future. A community open house event was hosted to present the findings to the public and broaden the scope of their ideas for solutions based on the themes identified. This activity used a local venue as a drop-in center for residents to gather information (presented via posters) and share their views. Drawing on the localized SDGs, a visioning and ideas workshop with key stakeholders formed a shared understanding for a sustainable future for their community on the basis of the earlier results. The outcome was a future picture of a bushfire-adapted community (SDGs 13, 15) in a beautiful, thriving natural landscape (SDG 6, 15), a leader in sustainable energy (SDG 7) and food sharing (SDG 2), caring for all its citizens (SDGs 1, 3, 4, 5, 10), and supported with a diverse and successful economy (SDG 8). The community also articulated secondary goals of a solar power energy grid (SDG 7), a reticulated sewerage system (SDG 6, 9), community gardens (SDG 2), and land-use planning, which allows for a range of inclusive housing options (SDGs 9, 11). The results of this transdisciplinary process informed the community strategic plan, aligned with the shared vision of localized SDGs, to support potential investment by local governments and agencies.  Stakeholder Engagement for Effective Local Actions Genuine engagement through participatory processes can also help in defining meaningful actions for the attainment of sustainability goals. Stakeholder consultation can build trust, a sense of belonging, and ensure more inclusive decisions that better suit the local social, economic, and environmental context.73   Engagement with stakeholders can inform resource gaps and therefore help in the efficient allocation of resources (e.g., via tax schemes, budgeting) in ways that serve local priorities.74   This can pave the way for an improved dialogue and decision-making alignment within and between local and national institutions. To further elaborate on participatory processes for the local initiation of context-specific actions for the attainment of national sustainability goals, we use the case study of village-based peatland restoration in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Massive peat and forest fires in Indonesia in 2015 caused considerable social, economic, and environmental damage.75   The burning of peat and forests emitted enormous amounts of greenhouse gas emissions and toxic air pollutants, causing major public health problems (SDG 3) and contributing to global warming (SDG 13). The fires have also left long-term destructive impacts on the biodiversity and wildlife habitats of the affected regions (SDG 15). One of the key policy responses to the fires was the establishment of a national body called the Peatland Restoration Agency in 2016 to coordinate the ecological restoration of 2.5 million hectares of peatlands and forests across local communities in Sumatra, Kalimantan, and Papua regions. The Peatland Restoration Agency aims to restore ecosystems through grassroots transformative change. One of the crucial steps in achieving this aim was the initiation of village-level peatland restoration programs known as “The Peat Care Village” (Desa Peduli Gambut [DPG]).76   The DPGs became the key institutional enabler, helping to align and operationalize national-scale restoration ambitions with village-level development goals. The DPGs enabled peatland restoration programs to be integrated and contribute to the acceleration of village socio-economic and environmental development, in addition to achieving restoration goals. This integration led to a wide community acceptance of restoration, indicated by the establishment of at least 394 contextualized local DPGs across seven prioritized provinces within 3 years.77   In most of these villages, DPG restoration programs were formally integrated into the village's local government mid-term development plans.76   From the experience of one of these programs in Kubu Raya District (West Kalimantan), it was evident that trust-building and genuine community engagement were the key factors in ensuring participation of local actors and the success of restoration efforts. To promote genuine partnership, before and during the program local facilitators from the Peatland Restoration Agency engaged with villagers to discuss their problems and aspirations and to collaboratively develop a plan for peatland restoration. Collaboration promoted co-learning between villagers and facilitators about what works and what does not work, leading to several demonstration plots (i.e., a field that can be used to experiment and showcase agricultural practices) for zero-burning agricultural techniques. Agricultural products (e.g., vegetables, coffee) harvested from demonstration plots were sold at local markets, providing economic incentives and sustaining the restoration program in the community. The DPGs also established local (and nationally aligned) peatland monitoring systems to track the progress of peatland restoration across the country. Local peatland restoration through the DPG programs was a successful local sustainability initiative whose impacts went beyond the local scale. DPGs accelerated and contributed to the achievement of national (and international) goals, such as poverty eradication (SDG 1), improving public health in Indonesia and in neighboring countries in the region that were affected by the smoke (SDG 3), climate change mitigation (SDG 13), sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems (SDG 15), and partnerships for sustainable development (SDG 17).  Modeling in Support of Stakeholder Engagement Models can complement and support the engagement processes in operationalizing local sustainability. Influential but uncertain drivers (e.g., improving agricultural productivity, frequent drought, increasing bushfires) could impact the future effectiveness of local actions and the achievement of sustainability goals. Computational modeling techniques can help in capturing and exploring these uncertainties4  , 78  , 79   through systematic computer simulations. For example, the use of a model-based scenario discovery approach80   can enable researchers to investigate potential vulnerabilities of local actions proposed by stakeholders and stress test their effectiveness in achieving the desired outcomes. The knowledge obtained from the exploration of uncertainties and their vulnerabilities can subsequently inform where the tipping points are and can guide the development and evaluation of adaptive pathways.81   Stakeholder engagement, guided by a priori  analytical scientific assessments, can contribute to the success of pathways in practice. Local actors tend to have an understanding of the knowledge requirements necessary to make the right decision at the right time and then for carefully monitoring and responding to the changing environment on the ground. Active participation of societal actors is also helpful for enhancing the institutional capacity to adapt to changing circumstances. This is particularly important in the context of the SDGs, which requires differentiated institutional capacities and governance strategies at different levels of society to drive transformative change.82   To further elaborate on the interactions of modeling and participatory approaches in adaptive planning, we briefly discuss the case study of the Rhine delta management in the Netherlands. The Delta Programme83  , 84   in the Rhine delta region of the Netherlands is a successful example of adaptive planning, targeting multiple SDGs, such as the secure supply of freshwater water (SDG 6), flood risk management (SDG 13), and nature protection (SDG 15). The Delta Programme was informed by a series of adaptive pathways62  , 85   to achieve the sustainability targets for the next 100 years, supported by comprehensive model-based and participatory processes. Modeling informed the evaluation of the efficacy and vulnerabilities of pathways to sustainability, surrounded by the uncertainties of socio-economic conditions (e.g., population growth, economic development) and global climatic change (e.g., increasing temperature, sea-level rise). In one example in the context of flood risk management, Kwakkel and colleagues86   illustrated how computational support could help in identifying the most promising pathways under uncertainty. For a given a set of actions (e.g., flood prevention measures, raising dikes), a prohibitive number of pathways can be constructed from the combinatorial sequence of these actions for minimizing objectives, such as flood costs, potential causalities, and damages. The creation and evaluation of many pathways can be manually impractical or even infeasible. Kwakkel and colleagues used a computational search technique (i.e., many-objective robust optimization) to generate and evaluate different possible pathways over many transient uncertain futures. The results informed the most effective design of pathways with their respective tipping points that could meet the intended long-term objectives. Participatory processes complemented the modeling in the design and implementation of adaptive pathways.87   In one example, Haasnoot and colleagues56   showed how they co-created a monitoring system for flood risk management on the basis of a long-term collaborative learning between stakeholders at different scales. They used an expert group of stakeholders with a diverse knowledge of climatic, water, and socio-economic conditions.83   Together, they identified future trends and developments (e.g., enhanced knowledge, innovation, or climate change) that could impact the implementation of pathways. They specified what combination of signposts and signals should be monitored to provide a timely and reliable alert to the need for adaptation (e.g., sea-level rise as a signpost for climate change impact). Haasnoot and colleagues showed how the interactions between researchers and stakeholders in the identification of signposts provided a sound and integrated monitoring plan.  Challenges Can Still Remain in Practice Despite the strengths of participatory and modeling approaches in coping with previous limitations in local sustainability, the combined use of the two can still face multiple practical challenges. Researchers can face dilemma in terms of when to choose which method for implementation and how to apply them through effective facilitation. The choice of methods and the extent of stakeholder engagement can be influenced by several local factors (e.g., data availability, stakeholder participation interest). This requires a careful consideration of local conditions and a custom set of methods and approaches suited to the local context.88   Participatory processes are also exposed to the risk of a premature judgment biased to past experiences, values, and strategic motives of a dominating stakeholder group.55   This necessitates engagement with stakeholders across sectors and scales to capture the diversity of ideas before narrowing down on actions. Participatory processes can face other practical barriers too, such as the lack of a willingness to participate, conflict of interests among cohorts, and stakeholder fatigue,89   which all need customization of methods for successful implementation. Modeling and computational approaches can have limitations in practice too. For example, although a computational exploratory approach can help in the investigation of a wide range of assumptions about future scenarios, it also generates large datasets of results. The analytical processing of large datasets can be computationally prohibitive for local practitioners who might have limited access to required infrastructures. This high computational cost can become even more problematic with increases in complexity, levels of agent representation, and (temporal and spatial) resolution of the systems under study.90   To overcome these barriers, state-of-the-art research has suggested efficient algorithms, parallel processing, and high-performance computing to reduce the computational costs.91   However, human cognitive capacity for analyzing multi-dimensional data remains limited. Large datasets can impose barriers on the communication and interpretation of the results with stakeholders in participatory decision making. Understanding the results from the exploration of uncertainties often requires advanced visualization techniques92   for viewing highly multi-dimensional data and the use of statistical and data mining algorithms for summarizing and clustering data.93   Despite these challenges, we are hopeful that by working toward the effective application of novel computational techniques and genuine stakeholder engagement processes, researchers will be able to work toward locally contextualized, transformative change across sustainability goals. Such transdisciplinary innovation will foster co-learning and collaboration between scientists and stakeholders for generating socially robust pathways that are not only salient and credible at a national or global scale, but also maintain their legitimacy and accountability at grassroots levels.

Data and Code Availability The datasets/code generated during this study are available at GitHub. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3992381 .   Systematic Search Procedure We initially undertook a systematic search to identify the most recent literature related to local sustainability. We created a database of 7900 publications, retrieved from Scopus with the following search string in the title, keyword, or abstract: ("Sustainable Development" OR "SDG") AND ("Local communit∗" OR "Sub∗national" OR "cit∗" OR "rural"). We considered the keyword "Sustainable Development" in addition to "SDG" to avoid the exclusion of other frameworks related to sustainability development (e.g., Millennium Development Goals) rather than the Agenda 2030’s SDGs. We did not include the keyword “regional” as it can make the results biased to region as a super-national scale (e.g., the European Union). We limited our search to articles as well as books and book chapters (that often contain pertinent examples) published in English between 2015 (when the SDG agenda was launched) and 2019 (the most recent year to the publication of this article). The search was conducted on 07 April 2020 with the following query string: TITLE-ABS-KEY (( "sustainable development" OR "SDG") AND ("local communit∗" OR "sub?national" OR "cit∗" OR "rural")) AND (LIMIT-TO (PUBYEAR, 2019) OR LIMIT-TO (PUBYEAR, 2018) OR LIMIT-TO (PUBYEAR, 2017) OR LIMIT-TO (PUBYEAR, 2016) OR LIMIT-TO (PUBYEAR, 2015)) AND (LIMIT-TO (DOCTYPE, "ar") OR LIMIT-TO (DOCTYPE, "ch") OR LIMIT-TO (DOCTYPE, "bk")) AND (LIMIT-TO ( LANGUAGE, "English")).  Meta-Synthesis Approach for Literature Review The choice of systematic literature review method depends on several factors, including the purpose of the review, number of publications, the type of information (qualitative or quantitative studies) being reviewed.14   We chose meta-synthesis given the large number of publications that we had and because we aimed to obtain high-level insights from qualitative studies. Meta-synthesis is a frequently used systematic approach94   in literature reviews for aggregating primary qualitative studies from different but inter-related sources to develop a deeper understanding of a phenomenon, and to create new high-level conceptual knowledge or a theory of different areas discussed among studies.  Topic Modeling for Identifying Priority Research Areas We used topic modeling for a meta-synthesis of the collected publications. Topic modeling involves the automated identification of the main areas in a large database of documents.95   In latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA),96   the number of areas is pre-specified by the analyst, and the algorithm assigns each document to an area based on the area probability of the document (i.e., the frequency of document words within each area). We used the Python implementation of the LDA.13  , 97   The result of this process are matrices of document-area (i.e., distribution of areas per document) and area-word (i.e., distribution of words per area) across all documents. The documents can be shared between multiple areas, and areas can also share words. Topic modeling enables an exhaustive literature review by revealing the main clusters of work and their relationships in the body of knowledge. However, given the statistical distributions of areas across documents and words across areas, topic modeling can only provide high-level insights and it is not expected to provide accurate information based on exact words of individual publications. In this article, we identified the principal areas across abstracts of publications by taking the following steps: First, we imported the database from the systematic search into Python and pre-processed the raw text of abstracts to create a corpus text. The pre-processing involves tokenization (i.e., splitting sentences into words, lowercasing words, and removing punctuation), lemmatization (i.e., harmonizing words to first person and to present tense), and stemming (i.e., reducing words to the root form). We also removed all stopwords and irrelevant words with no relevance to our study (e.g., years, some verbs). Second, we converted the corpus text to a bag of words to represent the frequency of occurrence of words in each publication (in the format of a dictionary in Python). Third, we pre-specified the number of areas among which the publications and words are expected to be distributed, and we applied LDA to the bags of words. A large number of areas makes the words within each area more homogeneous. However, it also increases the overlap between multiple areas and makes the extraction of conclusions difficult. In an iterative trial-and-error process, we found that nine areas were enough for making meaningful conclusions with minimum overlaps. Finally, we created word clouds displaying the frequency of words allocated to each area. We then named the area based on the most frequent (with relevant meaning) words in relation to the description of the 17 SDGs. Because we covered publications related to SDGs across disciplines (as we aimed to be multi-disciplinary in our review), our interpretative approach for naming areas based on keywords can be limited in that sometimes words might be taken out of their context and can have a different meaning. For example, a word like “poverty” or “mobility” can have different meanings in the social sciences versus engineering. Future research can search for publications within individual disciplines and test the sensitivity of topics across disciplines. The current matching between the descriptive words (keywords) and the SDGs are as follows (see the code in Resource Availability):SDG 1: “rural,” “poverti.”  SDG 2: “soil,” “crop,” “irrig,” “organ,” “yield,” “fertil,” “agricultur,” “plant.”  SDG 3: “health,” “care,” “mortal,” “child,” “death.”  SDG 4: “educ,” “knowledg,” “student,” “tourist,” “school.”  SDG 5: “women,” “gender.”  SDG 6: “water,” “groundwat,” “surfac,” “treatment,” “river,” “flood,” “basin,” “sourc,” “wastewat,” “sanit.”  SDG 7: “energi,” “effici,” “electr,” “gener,” “renew,” “solar,” “fuel.”  SDG 8: “tourism,” “econom,” “import,” “economi.”  SDG 9: “industri,” “compani,” “busi,” “sector,” “mine,” “infrastructur,” “technolog,” “financi,” “innov.”  SDG 10: “access,” “servic,” “household,” “inequ.”  SDG 11: “urban,” “citi,” “commun,” “region,” “transport,” “space,” “heritag,” “smart,” “network,” “hous,” “mobil.”  SDG 12: “product,” “wast,” “consumpt,” “materi,” “market.”  SDG 13: “chang,” “climat,” “risk,” “impact,” “coastal,” “protect,” “emiss,” “resili,” “adapt.”  SDG 14: “speci,” “biodivers.”  SDG 15: “land,” “forest,” “ecosystem,” “conserv,” “green,”“ecolog,” “protect,” “natur.”  SDG 16: “nation,” “institut,” “plan,” “decis,” “strategi,” “polici,” “govern.”  SDG 17: “public,” “action,” “stakehold,” “particip.”     Selection Procedure of Policy Initiatives We identified a list of key policy initiatives through a snowball search. A snowball search is a systematic process in literature review for identifying emerging sources as the study unfolds.98   We took the following steps in implementing a snowball search: Initial Set We initially identified a tentative list of a few major websites and reports on local sustainability. We used this initial list as the starting point. We then set our critical keywords (sustainability, region∗, communit∗, SDGs, business∗, cit∗) to point us to relevant references on local sustainability as we defined in this article.  Snowballing The initial list of websites and reports was used to identify other relevant sources linked to the critical keywords through backward snowballing (i.e., using the reference list to identify new sources) and forward snowballing (i.e., identifying new sources based on those sources citing our initial list). This resulted in an extended list of 41 initiatives (e.g., policy reports, toolkits, websites) that can be relevant to the topic of local sustainability. See this list in Table S1  and their summary from https://www.localsdgs.org/initiatives/local-sustainability-initiatives .  Inclusion and Exclusion We reviewed all collected initiatives to decide which new source to include or exclude in our review using three selection criteria. The first criterion was to focus on those initiatives that are related to local scale as communities, cities, or businesses rather than those with a sectoral (e.g., energy and natural resource) focus or those that are broadly related to the SDGs at national scale. The second criterion was to focus on frameworks for local initiatives with global applications (e.g., UN programs) rather than individual case studies which report on the implementation of an existing framework in a specific context. The third criterion was to prioritize those well-established initiatives that have been initiated by a legitimate body (e.g., the United Nations), extensively reported and described, and have been adopted broadly (e.g., in case studies).  Analysis We categorized the refined list into different groups (communities, cities, businesses) and summarized the contents according to Table 1  in the article's main text.
