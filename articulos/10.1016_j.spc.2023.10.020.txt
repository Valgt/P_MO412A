                  The interconnected and interdependent nature of water, energy, and food (WEF), called the WEF nexus, is essential for achieving long-term sustainability in producing and consuming of these three resources. Coupling and coordination degrees, which describe the intensities of interdependence and cooperation between different system components, are convenient for evaluating and managing the WEF nexus for a region or a nation. Although coupling and coordination of WEF nexus evaluations are essential for sharing knowledge about WEF security challenges, none of the studies has examined how coupling and coordination of WEF nexus based on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) affects a country's regions. This study developed a Coupling Coordination Degree Model to examine the WEF nexus at India's sub-national (States/Union Territories) level for 2011 and 2021 and address the SDGs. The comprehensive evaluation index and coupling degree, representing the progress score of WEF security and interaction between the WEF security, respectively, were first determined for the core WEF nexus using 29 indicators based on SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) and SDG 7 (cheap and clean energy). Subsequently, the degree of coordination reflecting the level of coordinated development on WEF sectors considering the governance, collaboration, and cooperation among stakeholders from different sectors was obtained. The results show that WEF components are strongly coupled with each other in all the Indian States/Union Territories. The results also show that the comprehensive evaluation index increased in 2021 compared to 2011, reflecting improved WEF security. However, the coordination degree of WEF security varied spatially and temporally, reflecting the variations in the coordination among the water, energy and food sectors in various Indian States/Union Territories. However, the coordination degree improved over the years, and consequently, 39 % of the States/Union Territories advanced from intermediate development in 2011 to good development in 2021. This study also identified the States/Union Territories of India that need improvement in the coordination degree of WEF security and suggested different WEF-related policies and programs for improvement. Results also identified that the development in the food sector (SDG 2) is superior to the water (SDG 6) and energy (SDG 7) sectors in most Indian States/Union Territories. This study may help administrators and policymakers identify the States/Union Territories requiring greater attention for implementing the existing or new policies to attain specific resource security.

Editor: Prof. Chao Zhang The interconnected and interdependent nature of water, energy, and food (WEF), called the WEF nexus, is essential for achieving long-term sustainability in producing and consuming of these three resources. Coupling and coordination degrees, which describe the intensities of interdependence and cooperation between different system components, are convenient for evaluating and managing the WEF nexus for a region or a nation. Although coupling and coordination of WEF nexus evaluations are essential for sharing knowledge about WEF security challenges, none of the studies has examined how coupling and coordination of WEF nexus based on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) affects a country's regions. This study developed a Coupling Coordination Degree Model to examine the WEF nexus at India's sub-national (States/Union Territories) level for 2011 and 2021 and address the SDGs. The comprehensive evaluation index and coupling degree, representing the progress score of WEF security and interaction between the WEF security, respectively, were first determined for the core WEF nexus using 29 indicators based on SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) and SDG 7 (cheap and clean energy). Subsequently, the degree of coordination reflecting the level of coordinated development on WEF sectors considering the governance, collaboration, and cooperation among stakeholders from different sectors was obtained. The results show that WEF components are strongly coupled with each other in all the Indian States/Union Territories. The results also show that the comprehensive evaluation index increased in 2021 compared to 2011, reflecting improved WEF security. However, the coordination degree of WEF security varied spatially and temporally, reflecting the variations in the coordination among the water, energy and food sectors in various Indian States/Union Territories. However, the coordination degree improved over the years, and consequently, 39 % of the States/Union Territories advanced from intermediate development in 2011 to good development in 2021. This study also identified the States/Union Territories of India that need improvement in the coordination degree of WEF security and suggested different WEF-related policies and programs for improvement. Results also identified that the development in the food sector (SDG 2) is superior to the water (SDG 6) and energy (SDG 7) sectors in most Indian States/Union Territories. This study may help administrators and policymakers identify the States/Union Territories requiring greater attention for implementing the existing or new policies to attain specific resource security.   Keywords WEF nexus  Coupling degree  Coordination degree  Sustainable Development Goals  Policy  Indicators    1 Introduction Water, energy, and food (WEF) security are essential to people's well-being and sustainable development. The availability and accessibility of these resources directly affect people's livelihood and health, besides governing the overall resilience of communities and countries. The concept of the WEF nexus has evolved as a valuable framework for understanding the intricate relationships and trade-offs among these vital resources (Kurian et al., 2018 ; Srigiri and Dombrowsky, 2022 ). For instance, water is required for irrigation in agriculture and energy production, while energy is essential for pumping, treating, and distributing water. Similarly, agriculture relies on both water and energy inputs for production. Changes in one sector can have cascading effects on others. Failure in these sectors can lead to vulnerabilities and crises regarding water scarcity, energy shortages, or food insecurity (Al-Saidi and Elagib, 2017 ). The interconnection and interdependence between WEF systems have gained significant attention recently due to their critical role in sustaining human societies and ecosystems (Stephan et al., 2018 ). During the Bonn Summit in 2011, the WEF nexus method became popular (Hoff, 2011 ). Since then, it has evolved into a widely known paradigm for integrated and sustainable resource planning and management (Kurian, 2017 ). The WEF nexus is a novel approach to resource management that ensures WEF security and improves production and utilisation efficiency in social, economic, environmental, and health sectors through cross-sectoral management and cooperation (Jing et al., 2023 ). The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and economic growth of a nation can be attained with the help of the WEF Nexus. To foster multidimensional, balanced development and attain sustainability for human society, the United Nations put forward 17 SDGs and 169 associated targets (Lee et al., 2016 ). Three SDGs, i.e., SDG 2 – zero hunger, SDG 6 - clean water and sanitation, and SDG 7 - cheap and clean energy, are directly associated with the WEF nexus. Understanding and managing the WEF nexus aims to promote sustainable production and consumption of these resources to ensure long-term environmental, social, and economic stability. However, due to a lack of knowledge about the present state of WEF security, particularly accessibility and availability, attempts to accomplish SDGs are being dented more and more. Many researchers have conducted theoretical and empirical research on the WEF nexus at various scales, analysed the nexus from various theoretical and methodological angles, and created several tools and techniques for simulation and quantitative assessment (Mohtar and Daher, 2016 ; Yan et al., 2020 ; Huang et al., 2020 ; Caputo et al., 2021 ; Wu et al., 2021 ; Wen et al., 2022 ; Mondal et al., 2023a ). Furthermore, using the Pardee RAND WEF nexus method, Mohammadpour et al. (2019) , Nkiaka et al. (2021) , and Mondal et al. (2023a)  have assessed the WEF security quantitatively and spatially (national and subregional level) and quantified measures that work across different spatial scales. They concluded that national statistics exaggerate regional similarities under specific WEF nexus metrics. However, there is disagreement on the optimal spatial scale in WEF nexus investigations (Naidoo et al., 2021 ). Concurrently, several studies have been conducted on the external mechanism of the WEF nexus, i.e., how the WEF nexus interacts with policy changes (Gain et al., 2015 ; Albrecht et al., 2018 ; Mondal et al., 2023a ), climate change (Li, 2023 ), land use land cover change (Wolde et al., 2021 ), the economy of a country (Taheripour et al., 2014 ), and monsoon (Barik et al., 2017 ). The WEF nexus model promotes resource efficiency by optimising water, energy, and food resources. However, coupling and coordinating these sectors enable the identification of potential efficiencies and opportunities for resource optimisation. The coupling and coordination in the WEF nexus are essential for achieving SDGs and ensuring the availability of these critical resources for future generations. Li et al. (2012)  proposed a Coupling Coordination Degree Model (CCDM) for measuring the coordination level between different sectors or elements in complex systems, particularly in regional sustainable development. The CCDM has been widely applied in various fields, including urban planning, transportation, environmental management, and economic development (Xing et al., 2019 ; Lu et al., 2021 ; Liu et al., 2022 ; Ma, 2022 ). In the context of the water-energy-food nexus, coupling refers to integrated planning, management, and decision-making across these sectors (Qi et al., 2022 ). It involves recognising the dependencies and trade-offs between WEF systems and taking a holistic approach to their development and use. On the other hand, coordination in the WEF nexus refers to the collaboration and cooperation among stakeholders from different sectors and levels of governance. It involves bringing together policymakers, researchers, practitioners, and communities to work towards common goals and address the challenges and trade-offs in the nexus. The integrated approach of coupling and coordination can help address the challenges of population growth, climate change, water scarcity, energy security, and food security while promoting economic development and environmental sustainability. However, only a limited number of studies have examined the coupling and coordination of the WEF nexus. Xu et al. (2019)  and Qi et al. (2022)  evaluated the degrees of coupling and coordination within the core WEF nexus, focusing on spatial and temporal scales in China. Their findings emphasised the importance of designing synergistic development plans for WEF systems while highlighting the need for further research to comprehensively understand the coupling and coordination degrees within the WEF nexus. Additionally, Cheng et al. (2023)  analysed the coupling and coordination degrees of the WEF nexus in China at the national level, using SDGs as a basis. They recommended conducting studies at the regional level, based on SDGs, to pursue SDGs within a country effectively. Despite significant advances in theory and application for studying the WEF nexus, earlier studies on its interaction still have gaps. In summary, the existing research still lacks the following: (1) None of the studies have connected the concept of WEF nexus indices with the Coupling Coordination Degree Model. (2) None of the studies have analysed the coupling and coordination of WEF nexus based on SDGs at the regional level of a country. (3) None of the studies have analysed the coupling and coordination degree of the WEF nexus at India's spatial scale (States/Union Territories (States/UTs) level). The present study focuses on the following goals to address the research gaps mentioned earlier: (1) Analyse the WEF nexus indices at India's sub-national scale (States/UTs) using 29 indicators based on SDGs 2, 6, and 7 for 2011 and 2021. (2) Formulate a Coupling Coordination Degree Model using the WEF nexus indices and (3) Analyse the degree of coupling and coordination of WEF nexus at India's sub-national scale (States/UTs) to provide valuable insights into the interconnections between goals, regional disparities of resources, policy effectiveness and state of resource management. This study will be helpful in policy-making and integrated planning, information and knowledge sharing, and resolving conflicts or competing demands among sectors.  2 Methodology 2.1 Study area and data The study area covers India's 28 states and seven Union territories (as of 2011), situated between latitude 6° N to 37° 6′ N and longitude 68° 7′ E to 97° 25′ E. Fig. 1   shows the study area map. According to the most recent estimation of the United Nations (UN DESA, 2023 ), India is now the world's most populous nation. Except for the northern Himalayas and the western desserts, most Indian states have very dense populations. However, access to essential services such as water, energy and food remains limited for most of the Indian population. Presently, 13 % of households lack access to electricity (NITI Aayog, 2020 ), 91 million people in India lack a primary water supply (WHO and UNICEF, 2019 ), and 189.2 million people do not get enough food to eat (FAO, 2020 ). The population is expected to be 1.62 billion in 2050, with a projected additional demand of about 30 % and 32 % for food and water, respectively (OECD, 2017 ). Additionally, over 880 Giga Watt (GW) of additional power will be required by 2040 to meet the demand (IEA, 2015 ). Table 1   shows the secondary data used in this research. Additional data like precipitation and evapotranspiration are collected from the Indian Meteorological Department (https://mausam.imd.gov.in/ ) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Web Enabled Landsat Data (WELD) products (https://appeears.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/ ), respectively. The current study analyses the coupling coordination degree of the WEF nexus for 2011 and 2021 to see the decadal changes in WEF security over Indian States/UTs.  2.2 Analysis of Water-Energy-Food Nexus Indices WEF nexus indices, like Water Sub-index (WSI), Energy Sub-index (ESI), Food Sub-index (FSI) and WEF nexus index (WEFNI), are calculated using modified Pardee Rand WEF nexus (MPR-WEFN) method (Mondal et al., 2023b ). WSI, ESI and FSI are the evaluation indices of SDG 6 on water security, SDG 7 on energy security and SDG 2 on food security, respectively, which depend on accessibility and availability of WEF resources. We have used 29 indicators concerning SDGs 2, 6 and 7 to calculate the WEF nexus indices. It is necessary to normalise the availability and accessibility index value once it has been calculated to eliminate the dimensionality and scale effect. To normalise the availability and accessibility indicators, we employed the min-max technique (Eq. (1) ) (Iyengar and Sudarshan, 1982 ; Singh and Alka, 2019 ; Jatav et al., 2022 ). With this method, all data is scaled between 0 and 1. Table 2   displays different indicators and corresponding equations for calculating the WEF nexus indices.(1) I scaled  = I actual  − I minimum   I maximum  − I minimum        2.2.1 Water Sub-index (WSI) The Water Sub-index (WSI) concept is central to our understanding of water resources management. WSI serves as a critical measure to assess and ensure water security. This index is calculated using a geometric mean, as denoted by Eq. (4), which combines two key components: water accessibility and water availability. Under the WSI, the water accessibility index is an essential aspect. It is calculated as a geometric mean of the percentage of the population that has access to an adequate supply of water for sanitation and improved drinking water and the percentage of farmers who have sufficient access to water resources for irrigation (Eq. (3)). In addition to water accessibility, the Water Availability Index plays a significant role in assessing overall water security. This index is determined by comparing the total available water resources to the total water requirement (Eq. (2)). Notably, this study considers a comprehensive range of water needs, encompassing domestic use and demands for crop, meat, milk, egg, and electricity production. One noteworthy assumption in this analysis pertains to the calculation of total available water. It is assumed that a substantial portion of water is naturally lost through evapotranspiration. To determine the total annual available water, the study subtracts the estimated total annual evapotranspiration from the recorded total annual rainfall. This step helps arrive at a more accurate understanding of the available water resources for various purposes, thus contributing to a more precise evaluation of water security.  2.2.2 Energy Sub-index (ESI) The Energy Sub-index (ESI) is critical to our energy security assessment. It is calculated as the geometric mean of two fundamental factors: energy availability and accessibility, as expressed in Eq. (8). Energy accessibility involves various aspects, including the percentage of the population with access to electricity for households, the percentage of households with access to modern fuel sources, the percentage of farmers equipped with modern farming machinery, and the percentage of farmers with sufficient electricity for irrigation (Eq. (7)). This comprehensive approach ensures a holistic evaluation of energy accessibility. On the other hand, energy availability is determined by the ratio of the total available energy resources to the energy requirements (Eq. (5)). The calculation of total available energy takes into account diverse energy sources such as thermal energy, solar energy, hydropower energy, and wind energy (Eq. (6)). Additionally, the study considers human labour energy and machinery in the total available energy calculation, acknowledging the energy required per unit of food grain production, from cultivation to harvest. Furthermore, the energy requirements encompass domestic needs, crop production, meat production, milk production, and egg production, ensuring a comprehensive analysis of energy security.  2.2.3 Food Sub-index (FSI) The Food Sub-index (FSI) is pivotal in evaluating food security. It is calculated as the geometric mean of food accessibility and availability (Eq. (11)). The geometric mean of ‘one minus fraction of the hunger index’ and the reciprocal value of the Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI) is used to calculate food accessibility (Eq. (10)). ‘One minus fraction of the hunger index’ represents the per cent of the population not included in the calculation of the hunger index and provides insight into the affordability and accessibility of food. The yearly total food available relative to the food required is known as food availability (Eq. (9)). This assessment includes major food grains such as paddy, wheat, and maize, as well as vegetables like potatoes, meat production (poultry, sheep, buffalo, and pig), eggs, milk, and fish production. The food requirements are determined by considering age-group-wise dietary requirements and age-group-wise population figures, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of food security. Finally, the Water-Energy-Food Index (WEFNI) is a holistic measure of overall WEF (Water-Energy-Food) security. It is calculated as the geometric mean of the three sub-indices: WSI, ESI, and FSI (Eq. (12)). The interconnectedness of water, energy, and food systems is visually represented in the (Fig. 2  ), highlighting the complex relationships considered in this study. The WEFNI provides a comprehensive assessment of the overall security of these critical resources, recognising their interdependencies and collective impact on sustainability and human well-being.   2.3 Development of Coupling Coordination Degree Model Coupling and coordination within the WEF nexus are crucial for sustainable resource management and addressing the challenges associated with water scarcity, energy security, and food production. A Coupling Coordination Degree Model (CCDM) for the WEF nexus has been developed using the WEF nexus indices. Subsequently, the model has been employed to examine the level of coupling and coordination within the WEF nexus at the States/UTs level in India for 2011 and 2021. The methodological framework for developing the CCDM is depicted in Fig. 3  . Firstly, the WEF nexus indices are obtained using the MPR-WEFN method. These indices then determine the comprehensive evaluation index (T). Afterwards, the WEFNI and T values are employed to calculate the coupling degree (C). Subsequently, the coordination degree (D) is determined based on T and C. 2.3.1 Comprehensive evaluation index The comprehensive evaluation index (T) is a way to assess how well different sectors are working together. It considers multiple WEF nexus indices to give an overall picture of the coupling and coordination among these sectors. It is calculated using Eq. (13) . In the equation, α, β and γ represent the weights of the security of water (SDG 6), security of energy (SDG 7), and security of food (SDG 2), respectively. According to van Leeuwen (2017) , all the SDGs given by the United Nations are equally important; thus, the value of α, β, γ is 1/3 each.(13) Comprehensive evaluation index  T  = α × W S I + β × E S I + γ × F S I = W S I + E S I + F S I  3       2.3.2 Coupling degree The coupling degree quantifies the interdependence and interconnectedness between the water, energy and food subsystems. It reflects the level of interaction between subsystems, where a higher degree indicates more robust interconnection and vice versa (Luo et al., 2023 ). Drawing upon sustainable development and coupling coordination theories (Qi et al., 2022 ; Wang et al., 2023a ), we have developed the coupling degree relationship as the CCDM component based on WEF nexus subindices. The relationship is as follows:(14) Coupling degree  C  = 3 × WSI × ESI × FSI  3   WSI + ESI + FSI   = WSI × ESI × FSI  3  W S I + E S I + F S I   3    = WEFNI T      Moreover, based on the literature (Qi et al., 2022 ; Luo et al., 2023 ), we have classified the coupling degree into six classes (Table 3  ).  2.3.3 Coordination degree The coordination degree (D) provides insight into how well the water, energy and food sectors are coordinated or integrated within a particular region or context. It is calculated using Eq. (15)  and used as the CCDM component. The value of the coordination degree ranges over [0, 1], with a higher value of D indicating increased subsystem coordination and D = 1 being the ideal coupling coordination state (Hu et al., 2022 ; Luo et al., 2023 ).(15) Coordination degree  D  = T × C   = WEFNI      Using the rectangle distribution function principle, we have further classified the degree of coordination into four types (Table 4  ) (Zhang and Chen, 2021 ; Cheng et al., 2023 ).  2.3.4 Comparative analysis of WEF security based on SDGs 6, 7 and 2 Water security (SDG 6), energy security (SDG 7) and food security (SDG 2) are all connected. They do not exist separately, and they have a complicated relationship with one another. If one goal changes, it will impact the other two. During the pursuit of SDGs by countries, the goals can exhibit synergistic or antagonistic relationships with one another. These interactions among the goals, influenced by various external factors, form complex networks and affect the entire socioeconomic and environmental system (Cheng et al., 2023 ). We have calculated the comparison coefficients using Eqs. (16)–(18)  to understand the interplay among these three goals. Furthermore, the comparison coefficient has been classified into five types (Table 5  ) (Cheng et al., 2023 ).(16) Comparison coefficient between Water and Energy  l we   = WSI ESI     (17) Comparison coefficient between Energy and Food  l ef   = ESI FSI     (18) Comparison coefficient between Food and Water  l fw   = FSI WSI         3 Results and discussion 3.1 WEF nexus indices The initial step of the WEF nexus CCDM involves calculating WEF nexus indices. Table 6   presents the values of the Water Security Index (WSI), Energy Security Index (ESI), Food Security Index (FSI), and WEF Nexus Index (WEFNI) for various Indian states and Union territories. Fig. 4   illustrates the spatial variation of India's water, energy, and food sub-indices for 2011 and 2021. The indices are classified into five distinct levels, namely: very low (ranging from 0.00 to 0.30), low (ranging from 0.31 to 0.50), medium (ranging from 0.51 to 0.70), high (ranging from 0.71 to 0.90), and very high (ranging from 0.91 to 1.00). Table 6  shows the values of WEF nexus indices, and Fig. 4  shows the spatial variation of the WEF nexus indices at Indian States/UTs. This variation in WEF nexus indices across Indian states can be attributed to the differences in implementing various WEF-related policies. Examining Table 6  reveals that in the case of 2011, Dadra and Nagar Haveli have the highest Water Sub-index (0.77), indicating 77 % water security. In contrast, Lakshadweep has the lowest Water Security Index (WSI) of 0.39, indicating a lack of water availability and universal access. Dadra and Nagar Haveli, located on the mainland of India, may have better access to freshwater sources than Lakshadweep, a group of islands in the Arabian Sea. The geographical isolation of islands like Lakshadweep can make water resource management more challenging. Dadra and Nagar Haveli has the highest WSI due to the higher value of the water accessibility and availability index. On the other hand, in 2021, Delhi had the highest (0.98), and Lakshadweep had the lowest (0.41) WSI. Regions with significant investments in water infrastructure development, including improved water supply systems and sanitation facilities, will likely have higher WSI values. Delhi's high WSI in 2021 may be due to ongoing efforts to improve water infrastructure in the city. Except for Lakshadweep in 2011 and Chandigarh and Lakshadweep in 2021, all States/UTs have a WSI above 0.50, indicating progress towards achieving water security. All the States/UTs have improved WSI during 2021 compared to 2011, except Chandigarh, Rajasthan, Sikkim and Uttarakhand. Moreover, the variation in water accessibility and availability due to the lack of institutions capable of delivering and maintaining water infrastructure, the lack of financing and political priority and the mismanagement of policies in these states (Water Aid India, 2018 ). Around 57 % of the States/UTs have a medium WSI, while 40 % have a high WSI in 2011 (Fig. 4 (a)). In contrast, 72 % of States/UTs have high, and 22 % of States/UTs have medium levels of WSI in 2021 (Fig. 4 (b)). Moreover, India's overall water security underwent an 8 % increase, rising from 0.67 to 0.75. This improvement is due to increased water accessibility and availability over time. According to NITI Aayog, the percentage of Indians with access to basic water improved from 85.73 in 2011 to 97.7 in 2020, while per capita total water availability decreased from 1545 m3  in 2011 to 1486 m3  in 2021 (Ministry of Jalsakti, Government of India, 2021 ). Fig. 4 (a, b) also indicate that most states experienced a shift from lower to higher levels of water security over time. This variation in water security changes across Indian states can be attributed to the differences in implementing various water-related policies, like Jal Jivan Mission (JJM), National Water Quality Sub-mission (NWQSM) and Jal Sakti Abhiyan (JSA) (Mondal et al., 2023a ). These policies cover water accessibility (JJM and NWQSM) and availability (JSA), focusing on providing safe drinking water to each household while increasing the groundwater level. However, most of the States/UTs have higher accessibility to basic water for domestic purposes, but irrigation water accessibility is less (Mondal et al., 2023a ). Water being a State subject, steps for augmentation, conservation and efficient management of water resources are primarily undertaken by the respective State Governments (Ministry of Jal Sakti, Govetment of India, 2021 ). Therefore, there is a spatial variation of policy implementation in Indian States/UTs, The Energy Security Index (ESI) values observed across different Indian states and union territories (States/UTs) in 2011 and 2021 reflect significant variations in energy security levels. In 2011, Goa stood out with the highest ESI of 0.64, indicating insufficient energy security, while Lakshadweep had the lowest ESI at 0.32, primarily due to limited energy accessibility and availability. However, by 2021, there was a notable shift in these dynamics, with Delhi recording the highest ESI of 0.88 while West Bengal had the lowest at 0.72. This transition underscores the progress made in enhancing energy security across the country during this period, as the ESI increased on average by 20 % in all States/UTs. Positive changes in ESI due to the implemented policies are working adequately, leading to increased energy accessibility and availability (Majid, 2020 ). According to the World Bank (2020)  report, electricity access increased in India from 67.6 % in 2011 to 99 % in 2020, while electricity production using coal and gas increased from 818 TWh in 2011 to 1335 TWh in 2021. An interesting trend emerges from the distribution of States/UTs across ESI categories. In 2011, more than three-quarters of the States/UTs fell within the medium ESI category, while the rest had a low ESI (Fig. 4 (c)). In contrast, by 2021, a significant shift occurred, with most States/UTs now categorised as having a high ESI (Fig. 4  (d)). This transformation aligns with the broader efforts to improve energy accessibility, availability, and sustainability in the country. The Ministry of Power, Government of India (2011)  had previously highlighted the inadequacy of per-capita energy supply in most Indian States/UTs in 2011. However, the subsequent shift towards higher ESI values suggests that comprehensive energy-related policies and initiatives have been implemented over the years. These policies include but not limited to the Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (PMSBHGY), Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), and Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha Utthan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM), have played a pivotal role in elevating energy security levels (Mondal et al., 2023a ). The significant improvements in India's overall energy security and transition of States/UTs towards higher ESI categories, reflect the positive impact of strategic policy implementation and targeted initiatives. These efforts have not only enhanced energy accessibility and availability but have also contributed to a more sustainable and secure energy landscape across the country. Additionally, in 2011, Himachal Pradesh achieved the highest Food Sub-index (FSI) of 0.92, indicating better accessibility and availability of food, while Chhattisgarh had the lowest FSI of 0.59 (Table 6 ). States with higher agricultural productivity often have better access to food. Himachal Pradesh, for instance, has favourable hilly terrain and climate conditions conducive to agriculture. This can lead to increased production of food crops and a better food supply. Moreover, due to the lower population, the food grain supply and requirement ratio was higher, so the food availability index was higher. By 2021, Andhra Pradesh has taken the lead with the highest FSI of 0.98, while Delhi lags with the lowest FSI of 0.46 (Table 6 ). According to the NFSA report (Puri, 2022 ), Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh emerged as the top three states in the State Ranking Index for ensuring food security. Moreover, Delhi has the lowest FSI due to less food production but higher demand. According to Rautela et al. (2020) , Delhi has experienced significant food insecurity. Food insecurity is highly prevalent among the poorest households in Delhi and is associated with the intake of many unhealthy dietary items. However, it is noteworthy that all States/UTs in 2011, and all States/UTs except Delhi in 2021, exhibited FSI values above 0.50, signifying substantial progress towards achieving food security. Furthermore, Fig. 4  (e) reveals that approximately 70 % of States/UTs had a high FSI, 22 % had a medium FSI, and 8 % had a very high FSI during 2011. Yu et al. (2015)  also reported that India did not have 100 % food security in 2011–12 and had trouble with food instability. Conversely, in 2021, 90 % and 8 % of States/UTs attained a high and very high FSI, respectively, as depicted in Fig. 4 (f). Furthermore, India's overall food security showed a notable improvement, with a 7 % increase from 0.73 to 0.80. An estimated 514 g of food grain was available per person for each day across India in 2022. This figure has increased significantly since 2011 (Keelery, 2023 ). Fig. 4 (e, f) also highlight a trend where most States/UTs, except Delhi and Himachal Pradesh, shifted over time from a lower to a higher level of food security. This results from the improved food accessibility and availability across most states in 2021. Nevertheless, certain states face reduced food security due to diminished food accessibility and the absence of advanced post-harvest technology, which, coupled with a 10 % post-harvest loss, leads to per capita food supply falling short of demand in India (IGMRI, 2019 ). The discrepancies in food security levels among Indian states can be linked to the variances in how different food-related policies, such as Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY), National Nutrition Mission (NNM), Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) and PM Kisan SAMPADA Yojana (PMKSY), have been executed (Mondal et al., 2023a ). Food-related policies increase the food supply, but the main determinants of food accessibility are price and socioeconomic factors (Jatav et al., 2022 ). The overall WEF security, represented by WEFNI, was highest in Himachal Pradesh (0.74) and lowest in Lakshadweep (0.44) in 2011. However, in 2021, the highest WEFNI was in Andaman & Nicobar (0.89) and the lowest in Lakshadweep (0.63) (Table 6 ). Most States/UTs had a medium WEFNI during 2011 and a high WEFNI during 2021 (Fig. 4 (g, h)). India's overall WEFNI showed a 5 % increase, rising from 0.63 to 0.68.  3.2 Comprehensive evaluation index The comprehensive evaluation index (T) mainly depends on WEF subindices (Eq. (13) ), and a higher T shows a greater overall WEF security (Qi et al., 2022 ). Table 7   presents the comprehensive evaluation index for the Indian States/UTs in 2011 and 2021. It is clear from the table that Himachal Pradesh had the highest comprehensive evaluation index (0.76) primarily because of its higher WEF subindices. At the same time, Lakshadweep had the lowest comprehensive evaluation index (0.47) in 2011. In contrast, in 2021, Andaman & Nicobar recorded the highest comprehensive evaluation index (0.89) due to the higher value of WEF nexus indices, while Chandigarh had the lowest (0.65). The comprehensive evaluation index displayed substantial variation across the Indian States/UTs, with an average T of 0.64 in 2011 and 0.76 in 2021 for India. All the States/UTs had improved their comprehensive evaluation index in 2021 compared to 2011.  3.3 Coupling and coordination degree analysis The degrees of coupling and coordination of the WEF Nexus in Indian States/UTs have been calculated using the CCDM and included in Table 7 . Table 7  shows that the coupling degree across Indian States/UTs is above 0.90 in both years. The high coupling level suggests a strong correlation between the three resources, i.e., WEF (Qi et al., 2022 ; Luo et al., 2023 ). The variation of coupling degree across Indian States/UTs is significantly less. The strong correlation between water, energy, and food in India results from the complex and intertwined nature of these resources in the context of agriculture, economic development, climate change, and policy decisions. Fig. 5   presents the coordination degree of various Indian States/UTs, classified from ‘primary development’ to ‘quality development’ level. In 2011, the coordination degree of various Indian States/UTs varied from ‘primary development’ to ‘good development’ (Fig. 5 (a)). Fig. 5 (a) also revealed that around 60 % of the States/UTs had ‘good development’ coordination in 2011. Himachal Pradesh has the highest coordination degree at 0.86, showing good coordination development (Fig. 6  ). This high value is due to the higher interconnection between SDGs 6, 7 and 2 (WEF security), policy implementation, and stakeholder participation. In contrast, Lakshadweep has the lowest coordination degree at 0.67, reflecting a ‘primary development’ coordination stage, which suggests that in terms of the water-energy-food nexus, Lakshadweep faced challenges in coordinating and managing these resources effectively, possibly due to limited infrastructure and development in these areas. Besides Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Kerala, Karnataka and Andaman and Nicobar have an ‘intermediate development’ coordination degree, which implies that they were making progress in coordinating and managing water, energy, and food resources, but they still faced developmental challenges in these areas. On the other hand, during 2021, the coordination degree of various Indian States/UTs varied from ‘intermediate development’ to ‘quality development.’ This suggests that over the decade, there have been improvements in coordinating and managing resources related to the water-energy-food nexus. Around 83 % of States/UTs had good development, and 14 % had ‘quality development’ coordination degrees (Fig. 5 (b)), indicating that most regions were progressing in efficiently managing these critical resources through policy implementation. Besides, Andaman & Nicobar had the highest coordination degree at 0.95 (Fig. 6 ), showing a ‘quality development’ coordination degree. In contrast, Kerala had the lowest coordination degree at 0.79, reflecting an ‘intermediate development’ coordination stage. Besides, Andhra Pradesh, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Goa, Haryana and Puducherry had quality development, and the rest of the States/UTs had ‘good development’ coordination degrees. Moreover, from the Fig. 6 , we can clearly discern that the Andaman & Nicobar Islands experienced the most significant growth in coordination degree, with an impressive increase of 20.25 % during 2021 compared to 2011. Conversely, Chandigarh exhibited the lowest growth rate, showing a decline of −3.25 % in coordination degree during the same period. This reduction in coordination degree in Chandigarh can be attributed to challenges stemming from inadequate and conflicting regional policies and regulations. Moreover, as populations continue to expand, the heightened demand for WEF resources intensifies competition for these limited assets, leading to potential conflicts and a diminishing willingness to engage in cooperative coordination efforts. Fig. 5  (a & b) also reveals that the level of coordination degree in Indian States/UTs improved in 2021 compared to 2011 due to increased stakeholder and policymakers participation in WEF-related policy implementation. While WEF nexus indices provide an ordering of States/UTs based on security, the degrees of coupling and coordination offer a quantification of the level of development in WEF security. Therefore, the degrees of coupling and coordination are more prominent in assessing WEF security than the WEF nexus indices. Notably, the coordination degree is likely determined by a combination of factors, including economic development, infrastructure, policy implementation, and resource management. Regions that invest in infrastructure, adopt effective policies, and prioritise sustainable resource management are more likely to progress from lower development stages to higher ones over time. It is clear from comparing the coupling and coordination levels that in all Indian States/UTs, the coupling degree is greater than the coordination degree. The values indicate that the level of interaction between water-energy-food is stronger than the quality of coordinated development (Wang et al., 2022 ). Therefore, governmental organisations, stakeholders, and decision-makers must concentrate on enacting new policies and programs to improve coordination and growth of the WEF nexus throughout most Indian States/UTs, especially in the States/UTs with low to intermediate development. In the long run, implementing actions that prevent ineffective and unsafe utilisation of water, energy, and food resources is essential, as this could negatively impact the system's security, coupling, and coordinated development (Wang et al., 2023b ).  3.4 Comparative relationship analysis of WEF security The comparative relationship analysis between Water-Energy (W-E), Energy-Food (E -F) and Food-Water (F-W) examines the interactions and trade-offs between WEF systems in different contexts (Fig. 7  ). Fig. 7  (a) shows the spatial variation of the comparison coefficient between W-E security in the Indian States/UTs for 2011. From the figure, it is evident that all the States/UTs have l we  > 1  , indicating better development of the water system (SDG 6) than the energy system (SDG 7), mainly due to the higher amount of water availability. Meghalaya, Odisha, and Andaman & Nicobar have l we  > 1.50  , reflecting an ‘especially adequate’ level of W-E comparison coefficient, suggesting these areas effectively managed their water resources. On the other hand, in 2021, around 64 % of States/UTs have l we  > 1   (Fig. 7 b). Fig. 7 (b) also shows that Lakshadweep has l we    lower than 0.60, reflecting an ‘extremely hand-impaired’ condition in managing water and energy resources. In contrast, Chandigarh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Nagaland, Puducherry, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu and Uttarakhand have l we    varying between 0.81 and 1.0, suggesting a ‘more shortage’ type of W-E comparison coefficient and energy security is more prominent to water security. Fig. 7 (c) shows the comparison coefficient between E-F, varying from ‘extremely hand-impaired’ to ‘more shortage’ level in the Indian States/UTs. When comparing the food system (SDG 2) and the energy system (SDG 7), all the States/UTs have l ef  < 1  , suggesting that the food system is further along in its development. While Jammu & Kashmir, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, and Sikkim have l ef    varying between 0.81 and 1.0, suggesting a ‘more shortage’ type of E-F comparison coefficient. Bihar, Meghalaya, and Andaman & Nicobar have l ef    lower than 0.60, reflecting an ‘extremely hand-impaired’ condition. On the other hand, in 2021, most of the States/UTs (88 %) have l ef  < 1   but Daman and Diu, Delhi, Lakshadweep, and Puducherry have l ef  > 1 ,   revealing that the progress in the energy system (SDG 7) outperforms that of the food system (SDG 2) (Fig. 7 d). Further, the E-F comparison coefficient varies from ‘severely impaired’ to ‘especially adequate.’ Most States/UTs are under the ‘severely impaired’ (22 %) and ‘more shortage’ (61 %) type of E-F comparison coefficient. Only Delhi is under the ‘especially adequate’, and Daman and Diu, Lakshadweep and Puducherry are under the ‘more adequate’ type of l ef   . Regarding the F-W comparison coefficient in 2011 (Fig. 7 e), approximately 80 % of States/UTs, and in 2021 (Fig. 7 f), around 67 % of States/UTs, exhibit l fw  > 1  . It indicates that the development of the food system (SDG 2) surpasses the water system (SDG 6). Most States/UTs in 2011 show ‘more adequate’ condition, except Jammu & Kashmir, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Daman & Diu, Sikkim and Dadra & Nagar Haveli. However, in 2021, 55 % and 25 % of States/UTs have a ‘more adequate’ and ‘more shortage’ type of F-W comparison coefficient, respectively. Therefore, from the comparison coefficient, we can infer that food security in most Indian States/UTs is the most stable (although insufficient), followed by water and energy security in both years. Further, we have also identified that the development of WEF security and the level of comparison coefficient has changed over time. Although there is an interconnection among the three SDGs, the linkages between SDG 6 and 7 and SDG 2 and 7 need special attention (Cheng et al., 2023 ), as energy is necessary for food production and water usage. Therefore, focusing on the development and efficient use of energy for long-term sustainable development is essential. However, the food and water sectors should also have sustainable development strategies. All three SDGs must work as an integrated whole to minimise the adverse effects on others.  3.5 Policy recommendation to achieve WEF security The degrees of coupling and coordination of the WEF nexus indicate the development level within the WEF system, specifically related to SDGs 6, 7, and 2, in Indian States/UTs. The analysis of the coupling and coordination degree of Indian States/UTs for 2011 and 2021 shows that the progress of WEF security (i.e., SDGs 6, 7, and 2) over time has improved in most States/UTs but is still insufficient. In order to attain sustainable development of WEF resources in the country, States/UTs with high coupling and coordination degrees must participate and contribute actively. Their active involvement is essential for achieving the desired outcomes regarding the sustainable development of WEF resources. In regions characterised by limited or inadequate water resources, such as southern (Kerala, Lakshadweep and Tamil Nadu), western (Rajasthan), Northern (Chandigarh), central (Uttarakhand) and north-eastern (Nagaland and Sikkim) States/UTs of India, it is imperative to enhance investment in scientific and technological advancements to bolster water security. The development of large-scale water harvesting structures, design of low-cost water harvesting structures for rural households, use of water-saving technology for agriculture (e.g., drip and sprinkler irrigation), reuse of household and industrial water, the establishment of wastewater treatment plants, installation of solar lift irrigation, deep tube wells, household tap water connection and sanitation could be the viable options (Ashoka et al., 2015 ; Islam et al., 2017 ; Tortajada, 2020 ; Cheng et al., 2023 ). In urban areas, implementing individual rooftop rainwater harvesting and wastewater recycling for vehicle washing, gardening, and agriculture could enhance water security (Chapagain et al., 2022 ). The States/UTs with insufficient energy resources, especially Jammu & Kashmir, Maharashtra, Mizoram, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Haryana, West Bengal and Assam, need energy security-related policy intervention. The energy requirements may be met by increasing solar energy output by installing solar panels in institutions and office buildings and using solar streetlights in rural and urban regions (Mondal et al., 2023a ). In addition, infrastructure should be put in place across the country to maximise the generation of hydropower and wind power. Promoting nuclear power plants, installation of biogas power plants in rural areas, providing electricity and LPG gas connections to each rural household, providing solar lift irrigation setup to farmers, installation of solar power drip irrigation, accessibility of affordable farm equipment and machinery to farmers through Farmers Producer Organisation (FPO) and custom hiring centres may also be included in the long-term strategy to address energy issues (Alaofè et al., 2016 ; Dawn et al., 2019 ; Majid, 2020 ; Vijayakumar, 2020 ; Sanchez et al., 2023 ). Moreover, all the States/UTs except Delhi have a high and very high level of food security but not a hundred per cent sufficiency. Therefore, the government has to focus on improving food security in these States/UTs by implementing different policies focusing on improving agricultural production, formation of FPOs on the regional scale, introducing high-yielding crop varieties through FPOs, popularising modern farm equipment and micro-irrigation, accessibility of affordable irrigation water for farmers, enhancing food stock by developing cold storage in villages and expanding the network of fair-prices food stores (Pandey, 2015 ; Devkota et al., 2020 ; Vijayakumar, 2020 ; Wang et al., 2021 ; Jatav et al., 2022 ; Mondal et al., 2023a ). Moreover, the government should optimise energy output and increase renewable energy R&D to address and strengthen food-energy and W-E relationships. Additionally, it is crucial to focus on reducing energy-related environmental damages by adopting cleaner and more sustainable energy sources, implementing energy-efficient technologies, and implementing environmental regulations (Cheng et al., 2023 ). Solar power-based or solar power IoT-based drip irrigation systems could be propagated to enhance food and energy security (Burney et al., 2010 ; Barman et al., 2020 ).   4 Conclusions The WEF nexus is critical in sustaining human life, and its interconnection and interdependence are crucial for achieving SDGs. Based on SDGs 2, 6, and 7, the study created a Coupling Coordination Degree Model (CCDM) to measure the amount of coordinated development and the quantitative and qualitative aspects of WEF security. Evaluation of the WEF Nexus at the sub-national level in India in 2011 and 2021 has yielded valuable insights into the degrees of coupling and coordination across the WEF sectors. The results indicated that there are varying levels of WEF security in the Indian States/UTs. Nonetheless, the coupling degree of the WEF nexus remained relatively uniform throughout the Indian States/UTs, as all regions exhibited a high level of coupling. In contrast, the coordination degree varied among the States/UTs, ranging from ‘primary’ to ‘good’ in 2011 and ‘intermediate’ to ‘quality’ in 2021. Approximately 60 % and 83 % of the regions demonstrated ‘good’ coordinated development in 2011 and 2021, respectively, while the remaining regions showed ‘intermediate’ development. Understanding the interconnectivity among the energy, water, and food sectors and placing sustainable development at the forefront of these systems are essential to reduce any detrimental impacts they may impose on each other. This holistic perspective promotes resource efficiency and aligns with India's commitment to achieving its SDGs. Assessing coupling and coordination degrees within the WEF nexus provides a valuable framework for evaluating and managing these critical systems. It highlights the importance of integrated methods, emphasizing that addressing WEF security issues requires a comprehensive approach. Moreover, by fostering greater collaboration among stakeholders, including government bodies, researchers, and local communities, regions within India can collectively work towards adopting more sustainable and resilient resource management methods, ensuring the well-being of current and future generations while safeguarding the environment for years to come. The limitation of this study is that equal weight has been given to all indicators to calculate the comprehensive evaluation index. Subsequent research has utilised the entropy method alongside hierarchical analysis to assign weights to indicators for analysing the coupling coordination degree within the WEF nexus. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis can determine the optimal weight allocation for each sector over a range of years, particularly in cases where specific sectors exhibit strong interdependencies. This analysis will help refine the weighting of individual indicators. However, only two years (frequency ten years) of data have been used in this study to analyse the coupling coordination degrees of the WEF nexus, thus ignoring the development trend over time. Future studies should overcome this limitation by analysing the coupling and coordination degrees for multiple years (frequency one year), considering the direction of development in the WEF system, which may help policy implementation towards achieving the SDGs.
