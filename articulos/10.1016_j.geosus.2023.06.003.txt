                  Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires effective national initiatives and resource allocation. Yet, the simultaneous attainment of all goals is hindered by constraints such as limited budgets and resources, varied national priorities, and the intricate nature of the goals. As we approach 2030 and beyond, an urgent need for an effective, data-driven prioritisation system exists to optimise what can be accomplished. A considerable knowledge gap persists in identifying the priority areas that demand concentrated attention and how their improvement would propel overall sustainability goals. To bridge this gap, our study presents a prioritisation approach that identifies significant SDG indicators based on urgency and impact, utilising Benchmarking, Bivariate, and Network analysis. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative Impact Index (IMIN) to assess an indicator’s extensive effect on the SDG network. This system carries significant international relevance by establishing a robust framework to identify key, potent, and interconnected indicators. It supports decision-makers worldwide in comprehending their nation’s SDG performance and promotes efficient resource allocation. In the specific context of Australia, our analysis spotlights several impactful, yet underperforming SDG indicators. These include the protection of Freshwater, Terrestrial, and Mountain Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), the share of renewable energy and energy intensity level of primary energy, targeted research and development, gender equality in national parliaments, and carbon-efficient manufacturing, amongst others.

Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires effective national initiatives and resource allocation. Yet, the simultaneous attainment of all goals is hindered by constraints such as limited budgets and resources, varied national priorities, and the intricate nature of the goals. As we approach 2030 and beyond, an urgent need for an effective, data-driven prioritisation system exists to optimise what can be accomplished. A considerable knowledge gap persists in identifying the priority areas that demand concentrated attention and how their improvement would propel overall sustainability goals. To bridge this gap, our study presents a prioritisation approach that identifies significant SDG indicators based on urgency and impact, utilising Benchmarking, Bivariate, and Network analysis. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative Impact Index (IMIN) to assess an indicator’s extensive effect on the SDG network. This system carries significant international relevance by establishing a robust framework to identify key, potent, and interconnected indicators. It supports decision-makers worldwide in comprehending their nation’s SDG performance and promotes efficient resource allocation. In the specific context of Australia, our analysis spotlights several impactful, yet underperforming SDG indicators. These include the protection of Freshwater, Terrestrial, and Mountain Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), the share of renewable energy and energy intensity level of primary energy, targeted research and development, gender equality in national parliaments, and carbon-efficient manufacturing, amongst others.   Graphical abstract Image, graphical abstract       Keywords Sustainable development  SDGs  National prioritisation  SDGs prioritisation  Network analysis  Australia’s SDGs    1 Introduction The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a global framework that serves to balance the main objectives of sustainability, including environmental protection, economic development, and social well-being. A group of 17 non-legally binding global goals has been proposed by the United Nations (UN) that fall under the responsibility and goodwill of nations to achieve by 2030. Despite countries’ commitment to meet the SDG targets, the requirement to implement it as a whole makes it implausible that all goals will be attained by the designated year (Allen et al., 2019 ; Collste et al., 2017 ). A recent study argues that in the ‘best-case’ situation achieving all SDGs by the intended year is far from reality even for a high-income and developed country (Allen et al., 2019 ). This situation becomes more complex when we consider how SDGs can both support and conflict with each other. The complexity lies in the fact that the 17 SDGs and their 169 targets are interconnected and interdependent (Nilsson et al., 2018 ), making it difficult to address one goal without considering its impact on others. Achieving a goal related to one aspect of sustainability, such as preserving natural resources, can be linked to both social and economic aspects as well, such as promoting good health and climate action. This gets more complicated when both synergies and trade-offs existing within and amongst the goals (Alcamo et al., 2020 ; Dalampira and Nastis, 2020 ; Weitz et al., 2018 ). This means outcome of a policy can hamper another policies impact (Zhou and Moinuddin, 2017 ). This implies that achieving goals in isolation or a traditional top-down or bottom-up approaches to attain a specific goal can have negative consequences on others and add more complexity to the process. In addition, as Lomborg (2015)  noted, “some targets could accomplish a great deal, while others may yield little. Spreading resources and efforts thinly amongst them reduces the overall benefit”. This sentiment underscores the major challenge of resource allocation that has been mentioned in literature for achieving SDGs (Biermann et al., 2022 ). Considering that countries have limited budgets and resources, and other national priorities, it is complicated to attain all goals simultaneously. In this regard, prioritising SDGs has been identified as a crucial step to improve the overall SDGs attainments (Asadikia et al., 2021 ; Huan et al., 2022 ). However, governments may prioritise certain SDGs over others based on their national or political interests (Horn and Grugel, 2018 ). This may potentially lead to overemphasis on particular goals and may compromise the overall achievement of SDGs (Forestier and Kim, 2020 ). Additionally, the UN has warned countries regarding this potential political bias that could have a negative impact on the integrity of the SDGs ultimate objectives (United Nations, 2018 ). This should also be considered that using a non-scientific system for prioritising goals without taking into account their positive or negative impacts on each other may cause more harm than good (Forestier and Kim, 2020 ; Scharlemann et al., 2020 ). The question we must address is how this prioritisation can be conducted to positively influence the overall achievement of goals? Despite the importance of SDGs prioritisation, only 20% of studies have focused on prioritisation efforts (Bennich et al., 2020 ). The most frequently used factors for SDG prioritisation in literature are often based on SDGs interrelationships (e.g., Asadikia et al., 2022 ), performance (e.g., Krishna et al., 2020 ), and alignment (e.g., Al-Saidi, 2022 ). There are also studies which use a mix of factors such as interrelationships and performance (e.g., Yang et al., 2020 ), interrelationships and alignment (e.g., Lyytimäki et al., 2021 ), alignment and performance (Allen et al., 2020 ). Only a handful of studies have conducted prioritisation considering all three factors at regional and sub-national levels (Allen et al., 2019 ; Tremblay et al., 2021 ). However, it remains a noticeable lack of comprehensive prioritization at the national level that takes all these factors into account. Given the challenges outlined and the identified research gap, this study aims to develop a comprehensive prioritisation method at the national level that encapsulates all SDGs, while reducing potential judgmental, subjective, and political biases. To actualise this goal, we adopt a systematic and empirical indicator-based prioritisation approach that combines Benchmarking, Bivariate, and Network analysis techniques. This approach is intended to promote data-driven decision-making at the national level, thereby providing a solid foundation for effective strategies aimed at fulfilling the SDGs.  2 Materials and methods To conduct this study, we performed a multiple-criteria analysis to categorise SDG indicators into transitional, high, or low performers, and determine whether they are influential in the SDGs network. Subsequently, we outline a sequence of targeted actions, which, when implemented, will enhance the achievement of SDGs in the designated country. This approach focuses on improving underperforming yet positively influential indicators to maximise overall progress towards sustainability. Fig. 1   provides a summary of the methodology applied in this article, while a detailed explanation is provided in this section. 2.1 Contextualisation In this study, Australia is selected as a case study to prioritise the SDGs at the national level. Like many nations, Australia grapples with challenges in achieving the SDGs (Allen et al., 2020 ). While progress has been noted in some areas (e.g., SDG 1 and SDG 2), difficulties persist in others. For instance, Australia’s per capita carbon dioxide emissions rank amongst the highest of OECD countries due to its heavy reliance on coal for electricity generation (World Bank, 2019 ). The country’s unique biodiversity and ecosystems are under substantial stress, exhibiting high extinction rates for numerous species (World Bank, 2021 ). Adding to these concerns, Australia’s current SDG achievement level falls below the OECD regional average score, trailing behind other developed nations in terms of SDG progress (Allen et al., 2020 ). This discrepancy is particularly stark considering that Australia ranks amongst the world’s top 20 countries in various aspects like economic development and human development. However, it falls short of being a leader in environmental matters specifically its SDG achievement (see Table S1 in supplementary material). This highlights the necessity for rigorous focus and strategic interventions to improve Australia’s SDG performance.  2.2 Data collection The important role that time-series-cross-sectional data plays in empirical research is undeniable. This study uses the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) database1 https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/ .  1   which incorporates more targets and indicators that other SDG databases (Warchold et al., 2022 ). Additionally, this database provides SDG-related indicators for countries across the globe for more than 20 years and clearly classifies them based on the related target. As the “country’s relative position” for SDGs depends almost entirely on the selection of indicators (Miola and Schiltz, 2019 ), using UN original indicators framework helps to ensure consistency in our analysis. It is essential to highlight that although the SDGs global indicator framework currently has 231 unique indicators (UN Statistical Commission and UNSD, 2020 ), some are further divided on factors such as demography or characteristics2  2 For example, Goal 12, “Ensure sustainable consumption and production”, Target 2 relates to sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources. One indicator in this target is “12.2.2. Domestic material consumption, domestic material consumption per capita, and domestic material consumption per GDP”. In the UNSD database, this indicator is sub-divided, measured, and reported with 51 individual indicators based on the different material, measurements (tonnes, kilograms), per unit of GDP or per capita.   resulting in more than 231 indicators reported for a country. In this study, we have compiled a total of 1,379 indicators and sub-indicators spanning the years 2010 to 2022. For this research, both indicators and their sub-indicators will be uniformly referred to as ‘indicators’. Since the number of indicators incorporated in each analysis varies, we elaborate on the filtering process in the respective subsections of each analysis.  2.3 Performance analysis To identify priority areas for SDG achievement, researchers often evaluate current progress to identify underperforming SDGs (e.g., Allen et al., 2017 , 2020 ; McArthur and Rasmussen, 2019 ; Apollonia Miola and Schiltz, 2019 ; OECD, 2019 ). This study focuses on indicator-level assessment since it can provide detailed information about the areas requiring attention as well as identify relevant stakeholders and decision-makers at national and sub-national (Allen et al., 2017 ). To examine a country’s progress towards SDGs, one of the commonly used methods is benchmarking (Allen et al., 2019 ). To render the analysis more relevant, we perform benchmarking against higher-ranked SDG countries with similar characteristics including the level of development and income level. To avoid bias that might favour one country, we compared Australia’s SDG progress against that of Sweden, Denmark, and Finland. These three countries are top SDG achievers since 2017 (Sachs et al., 2017 ) and still are frontiers (Hametner and Kostetckaia, 2020 ). Moreover, all four countries (Australia, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland) are members of OECD countries classified as having high incomes, developed economies with high Human Development Index (HDI) (World Bank, 2021 ), similar life satisfaction score (above 7), and sharing a high number of characteristics (Kubiszewski et al., 2022 ). Additionally, the government system for all these countries is parliamentary democracy, with further similarities in the type of constitutional in Australia, Denmark, and Sweden. To perform benchmarking we used Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Kruskal Wallis test which can confirm if there is a statistical evidence that the associated population means between more than two independent groups are significantly different (Heiberger and Neuwirth, 2009 ). As comparing groups with equal sample sizes increases the statistical power of a hypothesis test (Uttley, 2019 ), we calculated the desired minimum sample size with a less than 3% margin of error using the “sample size for estimation” function in the Minitab software. To include as many indictors as possible, authors evaluated indicators with less than minimum sample size and retained those that can be assessed. For example, indicator “10.7.2 Countries with migration policies to facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, by policy domain (1 = Requires further progress; 2 = Partially meets; 3 = Meets; 4 = Fully meets)”, has only one data recorded for 2019. However, it can be judged as whether Australia is performing better (higher number) or worse (lower number) than top-ranked SDG countries. To assess if an indicator is underperforming or not, the first step is to determine whether the trajectory of an indicator is positive or negative. For instance, while a higher value for the “3.1.2 Proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel” indicator is more advantageous for sustainability, a higher value for “11.6.2 Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter” is harmful. To achieve this, the authors carefully reviewed the indicators’ descriptions and classified them as positive (referred as I  +  )     or negative (referred as I  −  )    . We then categorised indicators into three groups: “Transitional”, “High Performer”, and “Low Performer”. These categories are defined based on the following definitions: Definition:  Indicator i   is Transitional  if the following expression would be True :( A i  = S i  = D i  = F i   )   ∨  ( 1 p ( A i  ,  S i   )  > α   +  1 p ( A i  ,  D i   )  > α   + 1 p ( A i  ,  F i   )  > α   ≥ 2  )      where A , S , D , F    is a vector of indicator values between 2010 and 2022 for Australia, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland, respectively. p   represents p-value  where significance level ( is set at 0.05. 1 condition    is a function which becomes 1 when condition  is True, and zero otherwise. Definition:  Indicator i   is High Performer  if the following expression would be True :  ( 1 p ( A i  ,  S i   )  ≤ α   +  1 p ( A i  ,  D i   )  ≤ α   + 1 p ( A i  ,  F i   )  ≤ α   ≥ 2  )        ∧ ( ( 1 ( i ∈ I  +  ∧  M i A  > M i S  )   +  1 ( i ∈ I  +  ∧  M i A  > M i D  )   + 1 ( i ∈ I  +  ∧  M i A  > M i F  )   ≥ 2  )         ∨  ( 1 ( i ∈ I  −  ∧  M i A  < M i S  )   +  1 ( i ∈ I  −  ∧  M i A  < M i D  )   + 1 ( i ∈ I  −  ∧  M i A  < M i F  )   ≥ 2  )  )         where M  represents mean (median) of indicator values when they are (or not) normally distributed. Definition:  Indicator i   is Low Performer  if the following expression would be True :  ( 1 p ( A i  ,  S i   )  ≤ α   +  1 p ( A i  ,  D i   )  ≤ α   + 1 p ( A i  ,  F i   )  ≤ α   ≥ 2  )        ∧ ( ( 1 ( i ∈ I  +  ∧  M i A  < M i S  )   +  1 ( i ∈ I  +  ∧  M i A  < M i D  )   + 1 ( i ∈ I  +  ∧  M i A  < M i F  )   ≥ 2  )         ∨  ( 1 ( i ∈ I  −  ∧  M i A  > M i S  )   +  1 ( i ∈ I  −  ∧  M i A  > M i D  )   + 1 ( i ∈ I  −  ∧  M i A  > M i F  )   ≥ 2  )  )          Definition:  Indicator i   is Not Evaluated  if none of the above conditions are met. Classifying the indicators in these categories also provides an opportunity to define the level of urgency.  Indicators with higher level of urgency  requires further attention in terms of planning and resource allocation to be improved towards sustainability objectives. The level of urgency can be defined as (i) High (for low performers), (ii) Medium (for transitional), and (iii) Low (for high performers). To perform a comprehensive analysis, data for all indicators relating to 4 countries (total of 1,379 indicators) are collected from 2010 to 2022. We then filtered indicators (a) that are not relevant to a country level, (b) have insufficient data, and (c) are duplicated. This assessment is conducted using a combination of IBM SPSS Statistics and Python scripts. Fig. 2   displays the final decision tree and the number of indicators involved in each step.  2.4 Impact analysis SDGs prioritisation is practical when it embraces and incorporates associations between goals (Allen et al., 2017 ). Although interlinkages between SDGs propose implementation challenges, they can also provide opportunities to maximise achievement by promoting synergies between SDGs. Hence, it is crucial to understand how the SDGs influence one another (positively or negatively) (Pham‐Truffert et al., 2020 ). Here we perform a quantitative and empirical approach that relies on actual indicator values to identify the impact of SDGs indicators. 2.4.1 Bivariate analysis A substantial number of recent studies performed statistical analysis to assess interaction between SDGs (Anderson et al., 2022 ; Baffoe et al., 2021 ; Bali Swain and Ranganathan, 2021 ; Dawes, 2022 ; Miola et al., 2019 ; Pradhan et al., 2017 ). For this study, we performed Correlational Bivariate Analysis based on indicators data’s distribution type. Bivariate analysis is a statistical technique that explores the relationship between two variables. It measures association or correlation and can involve various combinations of independent, dependant, continuous, or categorical variables (Pallant, 2020 ). In the context of the SDGs, we use bivariate analysis to identify the relationships between different SDG indicators and to understand the extent to which progress in one SDG may be related to progress in another. In this part of the analysis, the hypothesis is being tested as: “Is there a statistically significant relationship between a pair of indicators?”. Next, strength of relationship between each pair of indicators is determined based on the range of corresponding pairwise correlation coefficient: Low [(>= 0.6 AND < 0.7) OR (<= −0.6 AND > −0.7)]; Medium [(>= 0.7 AND <0.8) OR (<= −0.7 AND > −0.8)]; High [>= 0.8 OR <= −0.8]. To determine if a relationship between a pair is beneficial or detrimental, it is essential to consider the trajectory of the indicator. To elaborate, a positive correlation between a set of I  +    and I  −    such as “9.5.1 Research and development expenditure as a proportion of GDP” and “3.2.2 Neonatal mortality rate” is unfavourable towards sustainability objectives (trade-off) and it should not be interpreted as a synergy. Table 1   presents the method that categorises the synergy and trade-off between a pair of indicators3  3 The assumption is based on the impact of an indicator (i ) on another (j ) when it is improved towards sustainability objectives.   followed by the mathematic notations that is used in the coding of the impact analysis in Python. In Table 1 , synergies (S ) and trade-offs (T ) are identified based on the correlation coefficient (cc  )   , and the trajectory of indicators ( I  +  , I  −   )   , where threshold for positive and negative correlation is set at ≥ 0.6    (L  +  )    , and ≤  − 0.6   ( L  −  )   , respectively. Considering the associations which are provided in Table 1 , the impact type is defined positive (synergetic) when:S i  = S 1  ∪ S 2  ∪ S 3      and negative (trade-offs) when:T i  = T 1  ∪ T 2  ∪ T 3       We then combined the result based on the range of corresponding pairwise correlation coefficient and impacts type (Table 1 ) to categorise interactions in two groups of positive and negative with three levels of strength for each group as High Positive Interaction (HPI), Medium Positive Interaction (MPI), Low Positive Interaction (LPI), High Negative Interaction (HNI), Medium Negative Interaction (MNI), and Low Negative Interaction (LNI).  2.4.2 Network analysis To identify most forceful indicators, we suggest analysis of indicators network. The method of network analysis is one of the prominent and widely applied techniques to identify relationships between SDGs (Baffoe et al., 2021 ; Dawes, 2022 ; Dörgo et al., 2018 ; Laumann et al., 2022 ). Network analysis deals with the assessment and interpretation of complex interconnected systems and assists researchers to study the patterns of relationships and connections between the elements of a network (Freeman, 1978 ). This method is popular for its ability to visualise and conceptualise interlinkages, but also for the measurements such as degree, betweenness, closeness, and eigen centrality that it can provide. The degree centrality of a node represents the number of connections it has with other nodes in the network (Freeman, 1978 ). In our study, we utilised this measure to identify highly connected indicators . Additionally, we calculated the betweenness centrality of each node by quantifying the extent to which a node functions as a bridge between other nodes. Nodes with high betweenness centrality have significant influence within the network, as they control the flow of information between nodes (Freeman, 1978 ). We employed this measure to identify the top bridging indicator . Similarly, closeness centrality measures the degree to which a node is located near all the other nodes in a network. The higher a node’s closeness centrality, the more focal it is in the network. We used this measure to identify the top focal indicators . Unlike degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality measures, the eigen centrality (or eigenvector centrality) of a node considers both the number of neighbours and the importance of those neighbours to measure a node’s level of influence in the network (Freeman, 1978 ). A node with a high eigen centrality is connected to many highly influential neighbours, and we used this measure to identify the most eigen-central indicators . To achieve an effective prioritisation, it is important to not only identify critical indicators but also to evaluate the type of influence that an indicator can have on other indicators. While centrality measures can reveal structurally key indicators, they do not capture the nature of the connections and the overall impact of an indicator on the entire SDG network, whether positive or negative. To address this limitation, we introduce the indicator Impact Index (IMIN), which considers the type of interactions between nodes in the network. This index quantifies the density of a node by computing its average adjacency in the entire network, thus capturing the strength and nature of its connections. By including the values of S i    and T i   , IMIN for each i   calculated as:IMIN = |  S i   |  − | T i  |      where i   is each indicator and higher positive IMIN means higher positive influence on the entire network. To determine the impact level of synergetic indicators, we sorted them in descending order based on their IMIN values. We then divided those indicators with the positive IMIN to five groups, ranging from Strong to Low positive influence. To perform the impact analysis, all SDG indicators reported for Australia in UNSD are collected (total of 875 indicators). We then excluded indicators (a) which are not relevant to a country level, (b) with insufficient data, (c) relating to the means of implementation, (d) duplicated, and (e) those with the standard deviation of zero. To prevent double counting, indicators which are multi-purpose (repeated in different goals) are retained only for one goal, for example, “12.2.2 Domestic material consumption per capita, by type of raw material” which is reported by 12 sub-indicators, are also listed in SDG 8. Those types of indicators are only maintained for one goal. To carry out the network analysis, we use a combination of Python programming and Gephi software.   2.5 Priority indicators and actions list To prioritise the high-impact indicators, we considered their performance as well as the outcome of the impact analysis, specifically those that showed a high level of urgency with positive IMIN. We then present a list of actions that are derived from changing indicator wordings into a form of an act that can enhance them towards sustainability objectives.   3 Results 3.1 Data overview Despite extensive efforts to track SDG progress, a substantial number of indicators lack data and require data collection (listed in Table S4 and Table S5). Regarding the SDGs’ indicators of Australia, SDG 3 has the highest number of indicators with available data while SDGs 4, 5, and 14 feature a substantial number of indicators that lack data. It is also noteworthy that, although SDG 7 has a small number of indicators, data are available for all of its indicators. In the performance analysis, 1,379 indicators were collected (listed in Table S3), but 689 lacked data for Australia. We excluded country-irrelevant and duplicate indicators, leaving 280 for evaluation. For the impact analysis, 875 indicators were collected, with 186 excluded due to data unavailability. We also removed country-irrelevant and duplicate indicators, as well as those related to means of implementation. This resulted in a total of 108 indicators used in the impact analysis. 3.2 SDGs performance The performance analysis enabled us to categorise the indicators into three levels of urgency: High for low performers, Medium for transitional, and Low for high performer indicators. The results of performance analysis presented in Fig. 3   with the detailed information in Table S2 (see supplementary material) reveal several key findings. To begin with, certain goals such as Goals 3, 8, 14, and 16 exhibit a greater number of indicators with higher or transitional performance compared to low performers. Next, a high number of underperforming indicators are observed in SDGs 9, 12, 13, and 15 compared to high or transitional indicators in those goals. It is worth noting that SDGs 14 and 1 lack indicators with a high level of urgency, while all SDG13 indicators fall under the category of low performers. Additionally, SDG1 shares the most similarities with top-ranked SDG countries. SDG 9 (Industry, innovation, and infrastructure), on the other hand, has all indicators of at least three targets under the low performer category (targets T9.2, T9.4, and T9.5). Finally, the majority of low performing indicators in SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) are related to one target each (target 12.2 for goal 12 and target 2.1 for goal 2, respectively), where one indicator is reported by several sub-indicators, all of which are low performers (refer to Table S2) Note that for governments, the priority of attention to each pillar of sustainability (economy, society, and biosphere) may be different. The bolded goals in Fig. 4   represent top two SDGs with a high number of low-performer indicators categorised in each pillar of sustainability. Regarding goals under Economy category, Australia is in underperforming position in SDGs 9 and 12. Similarly, under Society category, significant number of assessed indicators for SDGs 4, and 5 show unfavourable progress. With respect to Biosphere category, it can be observed that the current status of SDGs 6 and 15 indicates that their progress is behind the planned target. Our analysis indicates that using only targets to design a prioritisation system may not be enough. We found some targets with a mix of low, high, and transitional performers across their indicators (as shown in Fig. 5  ). For instance, target 8.8 has several indicators with different levels of urgency and performance. Interestingly, indicator 8.8.1 consists of two sub-indicators, fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries, with different performance levels. While the former is a high performer, the latter is transitional.  3.3 SDGs impact While it is important to recognise underperforming indicators, it is also necessary to identify the level of association of each indicator with others.  3.3.1 SDGs relationships The present study conducted a bivariate analysis of 108 SDG indicators, resulting in 5,778 potential pairs. As described in the methodology, interactions between pairs classified into three categories (positive, negative, and no significant interaction), and six sub-categories (high, medium, and low for positive/negative). Fig. 6   illustrates the findings of the analysis, which include several notable observations. Evidently, almost half of the pairs (47.48%) did not show significant association, and the proportion of positive (26.63%) and negative (25.89%) associations is almost equal (less than 1% difference). Additionally, there were more pairs with a high level of association (14.86% for positive and 14.41% for negative) than those in the low (6.82% for positive and 6.77% for negative) and medium (4.95% for positive and 4.71% for negative) categories. While Fig. 6  offers useful insights into the overall strength and significance of associations, a more detailed analysis is required to understand the distribution of these associations for each goal. Fig. 7  (a), presents the results of a significance and strength analysis for each goal, revealing that SDGs 2, 7, and 12 have the highest number of negative interactions, while SDGs 1, 5, and 15 have the highest number of positive associations with other goals. Additionally, SDG 14 has the minimum number of negative interactions with other goals. Fig. 7 (b), illustrates the net effect for each goal, which represents the difference between the number of positive and negative relationships between the indicators of the current goal and/or indicators of other goals. The results show that for half of the goals (SDGs 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 14, 15, and 16), the proportion of synergistic relationships is higher than negative interactions, whereas the obtained insight shows the opposite direction for the other half (SDGs 2, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13). It is also evident that SDGs 5, 14, 15 have the highest net positive interactions with other goals. Comparatively, SDGs 11, 12, and 13 have the highest net negative relationships with other goals. While the knowledge of SDGs interactions at the goal level aids effective strategic planning, it fails to account for potential interactions amongst indicators. For instance, although SDG 15 has more positive than negative interactions, it does not specify which indicators are more synergistic. Therefore, impact analysis at the goal level might not be adequate for decision-makers to develop an effective improvement plan at the operational level.  3.3.2 SDGs network In Section 2, the need for a network analysis approach to fully capture the complex, multi-level interactions between indicators in the SDG network is emphasised. After removing insignificant relationships, we conduct a network analysis on the SDGs network consisting of 108 nodes and 3,012 interactions. The full descriptions of indicators are provided in supplementary material (Table S3). Centrality analysis provided a list of highly connected, eigen-central, bridging, and focal indicators (Table 2  ), which are visualised in Fig. 8  . Reviewing Table 2 , we observe that the top indicators remain consistent across all three centrality measures, except for indicator 16.1.1.b. While this particular indicator is highly connected, it is not amongst the top eigen-central or focal indicators. The network diagrams in Fig. 9   clearly illustrate the complexity and high-density interconnection between indicators. In some literature, key indicators are identified using only centrality measures. Although, these measures provide useful insights into the network structure and node positioning, they do not consider the type of relationship between indicators. Essentially, in computing centrality measures, the positive or negative nature of each relationship is ignored and while these measures can identify critical and influential indicators, it is unclear whether the overall influence is positive or negative. As an example, according to network analysis and centrality measures, SDG 2 has several top indicators from the centrality perspective. However, the result of bivariate analysis (Fig. 7 ) shows that the net impact of this goal is negative and unfavourable. It is apparent that in operational planning at the indicator level, insight into the influence of improving an indicator on overall sustainability objectives is critical. Therefore, association types (positive or negative) between indicators that are structurally influential cannot be ignored. To illustrate, we focus on a critical indicator identified with centrality measures, “9.4.1.a Carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion”. Fig. 9  demonstrates the interactions of this indicator. While many indicators are positively associated with this indicator, there are also trade-offs, which can hinder progress towards the SDGs. This adds complications and difficulty to advance progress towards the SDGs. Hence, it is crucial to prioritise influential indicators with a predominantly positive impact on the overall SDG achievement. In this study as a complementary decision driver to the centrality measures, we have introduced the Impact Index (IMIN). In an efficient prisonisation system, there is a need to identify the indicators which are currently low performing  yet have a synergetic  impact on the SDGs network. Based on the value of IMIN which is computed for all 108 indicators, Table 3   lists those that are synergetic (positive IMIN), classified into five categories of Strong, High, Moderate, Fair, and Low positive impact level. By simply reviewing Table 3 , several immediate insights can be gleaned. For instance, SDG14 has a significant number of influential indicators that have a positive impact on the overall SDG progress, while SDG12 has no positively influential indicators. Additionally, the results indicate that the majority of Goal 15’s indicators have a strong positive impact on Australia’s SDG network. It is interesting that less CO2  emissions per unit of manufacturing value added (9.4.1.b) is a synergetic indicator, while indicator 9.4.1.a (less carbon emission from fuel combustions) has more negative than positive interactions. This finding emphasises the importance of indicator-based analyses to gain comprehensive knowledge about each indicator and make optimal resource allocations based on the potential benefits of improving a particular indicator. It is notable that the result also identified not only positively influential indicators but also those that are highly connected, focal, and eigen-central. Table 4   lists those indicators.   3.4 Indicators with high level of urgency and positive influence In the previous section, a list of synergetic (positively influential) indicators have been identified. As explained earlier, to optimally allocate resources for any improvement initiative, there is a need to identify the synergetic indicators which are low performing (high urgency). In this section, we use the findings presented in Table S2 (list of low performing indicators) and Table 3  (list of synergetic indicators) to identify the positively influential but low performing indicators. After identifying these indicators, a list of actions is provided (Table 5  ) as a set of recommendations for decision makers on how to maximise the progress towards the Agenda 2030.   4 Discussion This study has contributed to the literature by (a) proposing a comprehensive benchmarking analysis which provides a clear understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of a country’s performance across all SDG indicators; (b) enabling policymakers to identify areas of overlap and conflict between different indicators using a bivariate analysis; (c) highlighting the key indicators critical to the success of a country in achieving SDGs through conducting a network analysis; and (d) introducing a new index for estimating the overall influence of an indicator on others, aiding in understanding the impact of each indicator on the entire SDG system. The outcome of this assessment can be utilised to optimise resource allocation and ensure efforts to advance one SDG do not undermine progress towards others. In this investigation valuable insights into Australia’s SDG indicator performance and associations is provided by systematically assessing them using Benchmarking, Bivariate, and Network analysis based on SDG data collected from 2010 to 2022. Our findings revealed that at least one-third of assessed SDG indicators in Australia have a high level of urgency and exhibit complex associations, including synergies and trade-offs. This finding underscores the need for the Australian government to adopt a well-formulated, systematic prioritisation plan for improving these indicators. Without such a plan, it is difficult to envision Australia meeting the SDG targets by 2030. The bivariate analysis of SDG indicators revealed a nearly equal distribution of positive and negative associations amongst the pairs, highlighting the complex nature of SDG interactions. Contrary to some studies (Bali Swain and Ranganathan, 2021 ; Kostetckaia and Hametner, 2022 ) suggesting that synergistic interactions outperform trade-offs in several high-income and developed countries, our analysis indicates that this conclusion may not be accurate for Australia. This discrepancy highlights the importance of understanding the unique context and challenges faced by individual countries in their pursuit of the SDGs, rather than relying on generalisations. The facts that a higher number of indicators with trade-offs can slow down progress towards SDGs (Kostetckaia and Hametner, 2022 ) has significant implications for Australia’s SDG efforts. With a high number of unfavourable interactions, the country faces a challenging pathway to achieve its SDG objectives. This could partly explain why Australia’s rank has been below the OECD average since 2015. Australia has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 as part of its whole-of-economy Long-Term Emissions Reduction Plan (Australian Government, 2021 ). While the commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 is commendable, our findings highlight the need for a more nuanced approach in addressing different emission sources and their potential impacts on broader sustainability objectives. By demonstrating the interactions of lower carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion we revealed that this particular indicator exhibits more trade-offs than synergies in regard to the overall achievement of SDGs in Australia. Conversely, findings also confirmed that reducing carbon emissions from manufacturing is favourable to other sustainability indicators. This implies the significance of carefully designing and implementing policies and strategies that target specific emission sources to minimise trade-offs and maximise synergies with other SDGs. We also discuss that while the centrality measures for a network can identify important nodes, it ignores the type of associations between those nodes. The proposed method in this study covers the shortcomings of just using the centrality measures. The Impact Index (IMIN) assists to estimates the total impact of an indicator on the entire SDGs network by rewarding synergetic interactions and punishing trade-offs. Since the type of associations between SDGs can vary depending on the context (Kostetckaia and Hametner, 2022 ), it is recommended that each country assesses the IMIN for their SDG indicators. By doing so, they can gain a better understanding of the unique interactions within their SDG network and develop tailored strategies to maximise positive impacts and minimise trade-offs. 4.1 Policy implication The insights derived from this study present a series of substantial policy implications related to the SDGs in Australia and potentially for other countries as well. Firstly, the necessity for a well-structured and targeted prioritisation plan is underscored by the findings of this research. With at least a third of assessed SDG indicators in Australia presenting a high level of urgency and complex associations, the formulation of comprehensive strategies to address these critical areas becomes paramount. Policy-makers should concentrate efforts in these domains, striving to bridge the gaps and foster advancement towards the SDGs. Secondly, our study reveals the intricate nature of SDG interactions, underlining that national strategies must acknowledge and navigate these complexities. Recognising that synergies and trade-offs may differ substantially depending on the specific national context is crucial. Thus, policies need to be tailored to effectively mitigate negative interactions and leverage positive ones. This becomes particularly relevant in the context of carbon emissions, where different emission sources may have varied impacts on broader sustainability goals. Finally, the study’s findings should be leveraged to inform policy decisions and planning, ultimately aiding Australia and potentially other nations in making strategic strides towards achieving the SDGs.  4.2 Limitations & uncertainties This study provides significant insights into understanding the SDG priorities and performance of Australia, yet there are a few limitations to acknowledge. One key limitation is the reliance on available data from 2010 to 2022, meaning that the current performance on certain indicators might have evolved since the latest data point. Regular updates are essential to keep the results relevant. Additionally, the study is based on the UNSD SDG indicators; different indicators or data sources might lead to different results, so the outcomes should be interpreted in light of these indicators. It’s worth noting that in this study, we employ Benchmarking analysis to identify underperforming indicators. However, this method might not yield precise results for targets or indicators with measurable objectives, such as “Target 1.3: By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women, and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions, according to national definitions”. Further limitations include the absence of scenario modelling and causal analysis in the current study. Future research could improve the findings by modelling various policy scenarios and identifying the most effective actions for achieving the SDGs. The study’s methodology and results are specific to Australia, which might not be directly applicable to other countries due to differences in context, priorities, and SDG performance. Countries should consider evaluating the IMIN for their SDG indicators to understand the unique interactions within their SDG network. Future research is encouraged to address these limitations, enriching the robustness and comprehensiveness of this work.   5 Conclusions Formulating strategic and operational improvement plans rooted in a well-structured prioritisation system can optimise achievements relating to SDGs. In crafting such a system, several factors must be taken into account. These include the network structure of the SDGs, the effect of improvement on the overall progress of SDGs, and the current performance of these goals. This research introduces a new prioritisation scheme at the national level that scrutinises the intricate network of SDGs indicators. The proposed system provides numerous advantages, including utilising a data-driven approach, analysing the most detailed layer of information (indicators), and merging performance and impact analyses to detect poorly performing yet synergetic indicators. The result of using the suggested system is to obtain clear recommendations and actions in the operational level to improve overall SDG progress of a country. Once a prioritisation framework has been established, it provides a solid basis for scenario modelling, which involves developing plausible and alternative future scenarios based on different assumptions, drivers, and policy interventions. By using an evidence-based approach to prioritise SDGs, decision-makers can optimise resource allocation to ensure that their efforts to advance one SDG do not undermine progress towards others.
