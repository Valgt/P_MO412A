Since the inception of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, the Earth has been continued to be damaged year by year. So, advanced materials are important to develop future innovative technologies and processes highly concerned with environment-ecofriendly approaches. In particular, the use of biomass and recycled waste sources is making innovation and technology greener [1 ]. Since there are interactions between human and earth systems [2 ], the Sustainable Development Goals are important for understanding the sustainability of recycled biomass, biorefineries, energy-related materials, and also their green technologies. It is no longer possible for countries to develop in isolation: innovations have to be developed and used worldwide, regardless of borders. Asia is taking the lead in this: in Japan, China, India, and other ASEAN countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Vietnam, people have built deep relationships and strong networks across borders to develop low carbon technologies, methods for recycling plant waste, biorefineries and other technologies through education and cooperation between researchers [3 ], leading to a symbiosis between human and nature to develop green innovations [4 ] using sustainable materials. This series of articles are written by researchers coming from the Asia network and describes recent progress in green technology and process relating to advanced materials. This article collection for Current Opinion in Green and Sustainable Chemistry  introduces efficient green innovation materials utilizing biomass and waste and classifies advanced materials and their processes for environmental conservation and electric energy technologies, which strongly support a sustainable society. This section has been organized into three subsections: (1) Biomass waste reuses and biomass functional materials, (2) Green chemical refinery, and (3) Sustainable green technologies and processes with advanced materials. Those subsections contain the following mini-reviews: Sustainable development goals for advanced materials provided from industry wastes and biomass sources ( https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/ ). This review highlights advanced materials developed for sustainable green technologies and processes as a key to a sustainable society in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Advanced Cellulose Cosmetic Facial Masks Prepared from Myanmar Thanaka Heartwood . Cho et al.  (Myanmar) describe how waste bark from thanaka wood is recycled to produce cellulose films and their application for cellulose cosmetic facial masks. Application of phenolic compounds in plants for green chemical materials . Okumura (Japan)  reviews plant phenolic compounds of condensed tannins and hydrolyzable tannic acid and their application to adsorbents and recovery/separation agents for the green conservation technologies. Chitosan and its biomass composites in the application for water treatment . Trang et al.  (Vietnam) describe green chemical materials of chitosan and their composites for application in water treatment, especially as eco-friendly adsorbents. Renewable biomass feedstocks for the production of sustainable, biodegradable polymer . Siti et al.  (Malaysia) highlight the uses of renewable biomass feedstocks of whey, molasses, glycerol, cellulosic material, and waste oil via bacterial fermentation for the production of biodegradable plastics based on polyhydroxyalkanoates and their derivatives. The usefulness of microalgal biorefinery into chemical products and recent technology in the automatic evaluation of microalgae . A microalgal biorefinery could be an alternative to petrochemical refineries. Takahashi  (Japan) introduces automatic monitoring systems for the evaluation of microalgal by automated cell counting with fluorescence detection. Study on modification methods to improve Li-ion storage capacity of carbon black . As demand for electrical energy increases, carbon black (CB) use as a battery material for improved electrochemical performance is reviewed by Zhou et al.  (China). Sustainable electroactive materials for energy storage . Okhawilai and Pattananuwa  (Thailand) describe biomass sources, their eco-friendliness, safety, and cost-effectiveness, which can be used to produce carbonized materials for batteries, supercapacitors, and separators for a sustainable energy supply. Supercritical CO 2  -assisted fabrication of advanced two-dimensional materials and their heterostructure . By using, a so-called ‘green solvent’, supercritical CO2 , Xu et al.  (China) review the fabrication of two-dimensional materials with unique structural features, their fascinating physicochemical properties, and their applications. Ionic liquids based aqueous biphasic systems as sustainable extraction and separation techniques . New processes for green and sustainable extraction and separation continue to be developed. Ramesh et al.  (India) review ionic liquids-based aqueous biphasic systems (ABS) and their use for the extraction and separation of materials. Sonochemical green technology using active bubbles: Degradation of organic substances in water . Yasuda  (Japan) reviews recent studies on the sonochemical degradation of organic substances applied for not only water treatment but also food processing concerned with the degradation of aromatic compounds, organic halogens, biomass polysaccharides, and microorganisms using sonochemical cavitation bubbles. We hope that these short reviews give you an idea of the range of new techniques being studied and developed in Asia. Declaration of competing interest Nothing declared.
