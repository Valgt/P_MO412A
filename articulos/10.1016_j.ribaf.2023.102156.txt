                  The present study aims to answer the question of the effectiveness of information and communication technologies (ICT) and financial development in achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). Specifically, it examines the joint effects of ICT (mobile phone and internet use) and eight financial sector development indicators on achieving economic, social, and environmental sustainability in light of the SDGs using data from 48 Sub-Saharan African countries. Using the system Generalized Method of Moments, we found that (i) the four dimensions of financial development and both indicators of ICT increase economic, social, and environmental sustainability, (ii) increasing the access to mobile phones and the use of Internet contributes to the development of the financial sector, (iii) the contribution of financial sector development on the achievement of the SDGs increases with the presence of ICT. The study calls on policymakers to consider the diffusion of ICT and the advantages they offer in elaborating measures for achieving sustainable development goals.

The present study aims to answer the question of the effectiveness of information and communication technologies (ICT) and financial development in achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). Specifically, it examines the joint effects of ICT (mobile phone and internet use) and eight financial sector development indicators on achieving economic, social, and environmental sustainability in light of the SDGs using data from 48 Sub-Saharan African countries. Using the system Generalized Method of Moments, we found that (i) the four dimensions of financial development and both indicators of ICT increase economic, social, and environmental sustainability, (ii) increasing the access to mobile phones and the use of Internet contributes to the development of the financial sector, (iii) the contribution of financial sector development on the achievement of the SDGs increases with the presence of ICT. The study calls on policymakers to consider the diffusion of ICT and the advantages they offer in elaborating measures for achieving sustainable development goals.

The SDGs are more ambitious and detailed than the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to improve current and future generations' living conditions (WCED, 1987 ; UN General Assembly, 2015 ). The 17 SDGs revolve around three main economic, social, and environmental sustainability dimensions (Purvis et al., 2019; Dhahri et al., 2021 ). Therefore, achieving them requires a partnership between the political planner, the public and private sectors, and the urban civilization that could ensure a better planet for future generations. Nevertheless, Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries still face many SDG-related challenges. Income inequality has increased due to job shortages, food price shocks, slower boom informal activity compared to informal ones, and weak social protection (ILO, 2020 ; World Bank, 2020 ). Indeed, the labor market situation is dramatic in this region (Sumberg et al., 2021 ; Cieslik et al., 2022 ). Socially, the latest estimates show that the poverty rate in SSA countries represents around 40.2% of people living on less than US$1.90 per day in 2018, which is estimated to double by 2030 (World Bank, 2020 ). Thus, SSA is squeezing to be among the world's poorest populations if the current economic challenges will not be directly resolved (World Bank, 2020 ). Environmentally, SSA countries face serious climate changes and global warming added to many social and economic facts. According to Edziah et al. (2022) , SSA countries experienced a significant increase in CO2 emissions of 15.48% between 1995 and 2017. Leimbach et al. (2018)  project that carbon dioxide emissions in SSA may increase by 50% by 2050. On the one hand, SSA has been marked by a massive increase in digital connectivity (International Monetary Fund, 2019 ). In 2019, 272 million people were connected to mobile and Internet services in SSA (International Telecommunication Union, 2021 ). In addition, the region has also developed digital innovation in financial technology, causing new services and various applications to be created (International Monetary Fund, 2019 ). On the other hand, SSA received 60% of the inflows from advanced economies (International Monetary Fund, 2021 ). Recently, resource-backed loans, mainly used for infrastructure development, represent 164 billion dollars: 66 billion dollars allocated to SSA and 98 billion dollars allocated to Latin American countries (World Bank, 2022). Thus, policymakers in this region must implement “the urgently needed bold and transformative steps to shift the world onto a sustainable and resilient path ” (UN General Assembly, 2015 ). This is what this current study seeks to achieve. Recently, many scholars have widely viewed the link between financial and sustainable developments as a controversial issue (Abbasi et al., 2021; Hunjra et al., 2022 ). Thus, there is a growing consensus among researchers that the financial sector helps attain economic, social, and environmental sustainability. In this context, several studies have intensely discussed the impact of financial development on economic growth (Schumpeter, 1934; Ruiz, 2018 ; Cheng et al., 2021 ). They have proclaimed that financial development is one of the key determinants of economic growth as it efficiently increases resource allocation for productive activities, enabling savings allocation for people and supplying credit and insurance. For instance, using data from 47 SSA countries, Abeka et al. (2021)  asserted that the impact of financial development on economic growth would be efficient if it had strong information communication and technologies. There is now considerable attention in the literature related to the impacts of financial development on social sustainability (Zhang and Naceur, 2019; Alam et al., 2021; Khan et al., 2022 ). Recently, Khan et al. (2022)  found that financial inclusion reduces poverty and income inequality and improves financial stability in 54 African countries. The literature about the impact of financial development and environmental sustainability is divided on the validity of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) phenomenon, ranging from supportive to unsympathetic. Some studies found that financial development mitigates climate change. For example, referring to data from 88 developing countries, Khan and Ozturk (2021)  highlighted that financial development reduces CO2  emissions. Nevertheless, the impact of financial development on CO2  could produce mixed results depending on the indicators of financial development (Acheampong, 2019 ). Raheem et al. (2020)  reveal that the interactive term between ICT and financial development negatively affects environmental quality. Additionally, empirical studies dealing with ICT's role in economic, social, and environmental sustainability have drawn the attention of many scholars. Some relevant studies have highlighted that ICT diffusion increases a nation’s wealth by developing skills and facilitating the exchanges between public and private management (Hong, 2017; Shetewy et al., 2022 ). There is also considerable literature on the link between ICT and social sustainability (Bouzguenda et al., 2019; Nandelenga and Oduor, 2020 ). Most of these researches show that ICT is the key to citizens' development. Indeed, many studies have examined the impact of ICT on pollutant emissions (Wen et al., 2021 ). For instance, Wen et al. (2021)  have investigated the relationship between industrial digitization and the environmental performance of Chinese manufacturing enterprises. They found that industrial digitization penetration reduces manufacturing emissions and encourages green product innovation. Recently, technological progress has enabled major transformations in the financial and banking sectors in SSA (International Monetary Fund, 2019; Cheng et al., 2021 ). It has also facilitated financial operations flexibility at the bank branch and guaranteed the banking sector's safe functioning through banking risk disclosure (Alshubiri et al., 2019 ). As far as we know, no previous study has examined the ICT role in supporting the financial sector to achieve the 17 SDGs in SSA countries at both aggregate and disaggregate (economic, social, and environmental sustainability) levels. This paper tries to fill this gap using the system General Method of Moment method (system GMM) for panel data composed of 48 SSA countries during the 2000–2018 period. This study has at least three main contributions. First, this paper is devoted to how African decision-makers can achieve sustainable development in line with the United Nations SDGs. As an extension of Das et al. (2018) , who only examined the joint effect of ICT and financial development on economic growth, we seek to extend previous literature on achieving the SDGs by demonstrating how ICT supports financial sector development for attaining sustainable development in SSA countries at both aggregate and disaggregate levels. Specifically, by relying on the works of Costanza et al. (2016)  and Dhahri et al. (2021)  related to the theoretical classification of the 17 SGDs, we are studying the joint effects of ICT (mobile phone and Internet use) and eight financial sector development indicators on achieving the three dimensions of sustainability (economic, social and environmental). They especially suggested that Goals 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12 are related to economic sustainability (1); Goals 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 16, and 17 revolve around social sustainability (2); Goals 6, 13, 14 and 15 represent environmental sustainability (3). Based on this division and using principal component analysis (PCA), we have created three sustainability indicators corresponding to the economic, social, and environmental dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, this inquiry is the first to examine the link between financial development, ICT, and three dimensions of the 17 SDGs in an integrated framework. Secondly, previous studies such as Abeka et al. (2021)  have examined the impact of ICT and financial development, measured by domestic credit to the private sector, on economic growth in SSA. However, this measure may have limited any ability to capture the financial development multidimensional aspect. This study tries to fill this gap by proposing three composite indexes of financial sector development considering its four dimensions. Third, in terms of results, we found that the contribution of financial sector development to achieve sustainable development goals increases with the presence of ICT diffusion. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2  briefly reviews the related literature. Section 3  describes the econometric methodology and data sources. Section 4  presents and discusses the empirical findings. The last section is devoted to the conclusion and implications.  2 Literature review We divide this section into three subsections. The first subsection provides an overview of SDGs' definitions and dimensions. The other ones present the theoretical arguments and empirical evidence on the role of ICT and financial development in achieving the SDGs. 2.1 Sustainable development goals (SDGs) In recent decades, numerous definitions have been proposed for sustainable development and sustainability because of their complexity (Lozano, 2008; Wuelser et al., 2012 ). In 1980, the International Union first used the term “sustainable development ” for Nature Conservation (IUCN, 1980 ). The World Commission on Environment and Development (1987 , p.15) has defined sustainable development as "ensuring that [development] meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs ." This definition has been developed to embrace the environmental, economic, and social dimensions, recognized as the triple bottom line (e.g., Choi and Ng, 2011 ). According to the United Nations (1992) , the 17 SDGs, comprised of 169 targets and 232 specific indicators, seek to eliminate poverty, promote social and economic inclusion, and mitigate environmental degradation. Indeed, it is important to measure the SDGs to facilitate monitoring the 2030 Agenda's effectiveness (Swain and Yang-Wallentin, 2020 ). There is now considerable attention in the literature regarding SDGs measurement (Spaiser et al., 2017 ; Dhahri et al., 2021 ). In this study, we followed Dhahri et al. (2021)  to calculate the scores for each SDG using several observed indicators, then its overall index using the principal component analysis (PCA) method. The social, economic, and environmental dimensions of sustainability help highlight the current state of sustainability and suggest directions for policymakers to formulate policies and programs that could stimulate countries to achieve sustainability.  2.2 Theoretical arguments Three main theories were used to explain the relationship between ICT, financial development, and the SDGs: the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC), Schumpeter's Theory of Economic Development, and the Diffusion of Innovation Theory. Regarding the EKC theory, Grossman and Krueger (1993)  confirmed that economic growth increases with environmental degradation; however, up to a certain turning point, economic growth reduces environmental degradation. This observation is indicated by the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis, which symbolizes an inverted U-shaped relationship between economic growth and environmental degradation. Therefore, in the early stage of economic growth, using inefficient technologies by industries with high-energy consumption and long equipment life in production leads to environmental degradation and pollution. Besides, at the turning point, financial development encourages companies to take action to reduce CO2 emissions by investing in environmentally friendly technologies in the industrial sector (Adams and Klobodu, 2018; Renzhi and Baek, 2020 ). Thus, financial development is useful for promoting efficient technology and sustainable development. Moreover, Schumpeter’s Theory of Innovation (Schumpeter, 1939 ) discussed how innovation in the financial sector affects growth and development. Schumpeter asserted that financiers or financial intermediaries rely on high technology to provide funds to stagnant and risky companies to help them develop new ideas and expand their operations (Schumpeter, 1939 ). Hence, Schumpeter believes that expanding corporate business through these funds will help raise employment and income, allowing people to save children's education and access to necessary health care. Finally, Rogers (1962)  developed the diffusion of innovation theory, which states that innovation in the financial system is accepted when it is widely diffused. This can happen when residents have more access to the financial system. As a result, innovation is critical to achieving sustainable economic development (Kardos, 2012 ). According to these theories, financial development and ICT can improve sustainability in three areas: economic growth, environmental protection, and social sustainability.  2.3 Empirical literature and hypotheses development 2.3.1 Financial development and SDGs We have divided this section into three strands: the first presents the impact of financial development on the economic dimension, whereas the second focuses on the impact of financial development on the social dimension. The last one reflects the impact of financial development on the environmental dimension. Firstly, pioneers who have worked in economic growth widely considered financial sector development as one of the main factors for national economic growth (Schumpeter, 1911; McKinnon, 1973 ). Nevertheless, many controversial results have surrounded the existing literature on the relationship between financial sector development and economic growth, as no consensus has been reached among scholars. Accordingly, we divided the empirical results into two broad groups. The first group has asserted that the development of the financial sector has a positive effect on economic growth (Assefa and Mollick, 2017 ). In this context, Cheng et al. (2021)  claimed that developing the financial markets makes it possible to accumulate savings, direct resources towards more productive investments, reduce transaction and information costs and promote the trade industry. In contrast, the second group has criticized that the development of the financial sector has a positive effect on economic growth only under threshold factors presence (Taiwo, 2021; Karim et al., 2022 ). For instance, Aluko and Ibrahim (2020)  have examined the effect of financial development on economic growth by considering the institution level as a threshold variable in 28 SSA. They revealed that the financial sector promotes growth in highly institutionalized countries. Recently, Karim et al. (2022)  found that financial inclusion is beneficial and positively affects economic growth at lower or upper-bound levels in a different system. Moreover, they found a positive impact of financial inclusion on promoting growth among least developed and emerging countries compared to developed countries. Secondly, many scholars, such as Kaidi et al. (2019) , Tchamyou et al., 2019 , among others, view the financial sector development as a solution to several common social issues in SSA. Nonetheless, Rashid and Intartaglia (2017)  claimed that the effect of financial sector development in reducing poverty varies depending on the proxies used to measure financial sector development. Using data from 46 SSA countries, Chireshe and Ocran (2020)  have shown that financial sector development positively affects health expenditure. Recently, Gallego-Losada et al. (2023)  consider that economic inclusion represents the cornerstone of social development by lowering poverty, enhancing incomes, and permitting sound economic choices that contribute to growing financial savings and reducing gender inequality. Finally, previous studies have discussed the importance of financial development to enhance environmental quality. Tamazian et al. (2009)  have argued that increasing the allocation of credit at low-cost facilitates purchasing energy-efficient technologies, which in turn leads to reduced carbon emissions. Overall, the link between financial sector development and environmental quality has shown three contradictory results: (i) financial sector development promotes the quality of the environment (Nasir et al., 2019; Zaidi et al., 2019 ); (ii) financial sector development destroys the quality of the environment by increasing carbon emissions (Ali et al., 2017; Baloch et al., 2019; Murshed et al., 2023 ); (iii) financial sector development has an insignificant effect on environmental quality (Ozturk and Acaravci, 2013 ). In sum, empirical studies on the effect of financial sector development on environmental quality remain rare and controversial in SSA. Abid (2016)  has found that the advancement of financial resources is negatively correlated with CO2  emissions in 25 SSA countries. Adams and Klobodu (2018)  have asserted that the development of the financial sector has an insignificant impact on environmental quality in 26 African countries. More recently, Omri et al. (2021)  revealed that financial sector development decreases carbon emissions in the presence of solid institutional and political governance. Numerous studies found a positive impact of money supply on environmental sustainability. For example, Vo and Zaman (2020)  found that increasing the money supply helps reduce CO2  emissions in the long term using a large panel of 101 global economies. Additionally, Mahmood et al. (2022)  found that money supply, which represents both liquid cash and financial sector deposits, negatively affects territory-based CO2  (TBC) and consumption-based CO2  (CBC) emissions in the long term and positively affects it in the short run. They explained this result because the money supply caused foreign direct investment and expansion in the short term; however, it raised cleaner technologies in the long term. The present study follows the work of Ben Youssef et al. (2020) , who investigated the impact of financial development on achieving sustainable development in14 the Middle East and North African countries (MENA), and they found that financial development has a small impact on sustainable development in the long term. However, two large gaps characterize this study of Ben Youssef et al. (2020)  and the above-discussed studies on the relationship between financial development and sustainable development, especially in the case of SSA countries. On the one hand, they did not specify the effects of financial sector development on the three dimensions of sustainable development in an integrated framework and in line with the 17 SDGs. Accordingly, we divided the 17 SDGs into three economic, social, and environmental dimensions, where each one is associated with specific goals: the economic dimension includes goals 7, 9, 11, and 12; the social dimension incorporates goals 1, 5, 10, 16 and 17; environmental dimension encompasses the goals 6 and 13–15. On the other hand, when examining the effects of financial development, their study uses only one indicator of financial development, whereas the nature of financial sector development is multidimensional. This study fills this second gap by considering various indicators of financial development (including depth, inclusion, efficiency, and stability) to examine their effects on the three dimensions of the 17 SDGs at the aggregate and disaggregated level in SSA countries. Based on this discussion, we expect that financial sector development is relevant for achieving the SDGs in SSA countries at both aggregate and disaggregate levels. As a result, we provide the following hypothesis:Hypothesis 1 Financial development positively contributes to achieving the SDGs in SSA at both aggregate and disaggregate levels.    2.3.2 The role of ICT We divide this subsection into two strands. The first one reviews the role of ICT in the three dimensions of sustainable development. The second strand highlights the role of ICT in financial sector development. Many academics have assessed the effect of ICTs diffusion on the economic dimension of sustainability. Accordingly, Ben Youssef et al. (2018)  have contended that a higher level of innovation and good institutional quality is a driving force for achieving a higher level of entrepreneurship and sustainability. Yet, few studies have studied the impact of ICTs on economic growth in SSA. Donou-Adonsou et al. (2016)  have examined the role of telecommunications infrastructure in SSA economic growth. They have confirmed that both mobile phones and the Internet boost economic growth. Using information from 40 SSA countries, Haftu (2019)  investigated the effect of mobile phone and Internet use on GDP per capita from 2006 to 2015. They revealed that a 10% increase in mobile phone penetration contributed to a 1.2% rise in GDP per capita. They claimed that boosting mobile phone service has a favorable influence on per capita income, reducing the number of impoverished individuals in the region. They have asserted that promoting access to cell phones positively impacts per capita income, thus lowering the number of poor people in the region. Many studies believe that ICT is crucial for promoting many social problems. First, it supports gender empowerment (Ojo et al., 2013; Asongu et al., 2021 ). Second, it helps to improve health care and education (Haluza and Jungwirth, 2018 ). Third, it reduces inequality (Adams and Akobeng, 2021 ). Moreover, the impact of ICT on environmental sustainability has also received great attention in the literature and has come up with mixed results. Some authors have found that ICT significantly reduces CO2  emissions (Park et al., 2018 ; Ozcan and Apergis, 2018 ). Others have claimed that the effect of ICTs on environmental quality varies depending on the development degree of a country degree. (Al-Mulali et al., 2015; Danish et al., 2018 ). Besides, Higón et al. (2017)  and Shahnazi and Shabani (2019)  have confirmed a non-linear relationship between ICT and CO2  emissions, which supports the environmental Kuznets curve. Recently, Amri et al. (2019)  found an insignificant impact of ICT on carbon emissions. In the case of SSA, Asongu et al. (2018)  have evaluated the influence of rising ICT penetration, as measured by mobile phone and Internet penetration, on CO2  emissions. They have found that Internet adoption has increased per capita CO2  emissions from liquid fuel consumption. However, mobile phone harms it. Meanwhile, Danish et al. (2018)  successfully identified that the interaction effects between ICT and economic growth decrease CO2  emissions in SSA. Moving to the second strand of studies about the effect of ICT on financial sector development. Since the turn of the century, the adoption of ICT has steadily increased. Thus, several studies have examined its benefits, particularly on financial sector development. Choi et al. (2014)  have indicated that Internet service availability enhances capital flow across borders by reducing information asymmetries and transaction costs in the financial markets. For those reasons, the World Bank (2017)  has established cooperation with its clients to support the ICT industry through technical assistance and business loans. This has underpinned many financial industries to integrate ICT while modernizing internal processes and providing advanced mobile phone services such as bill payment, remittances, and cash transfers. Pellegrina et al. (2017)  have proposed that increasing the Internet prevalence allows small businesses to access credit facilities from various financial institutions. Likewise, Boateng et al. (2018)  have supported that ICT increases the likelihood of information flows in the financial marketplace between lenders and borrowers. Recently, Gallego-Losada et al. (2023)  argued that the rapid development of ICT is the backbone of these transformations in the banking and financial sectors. However, limited studies examined the impact of ICTs on the financial sector development in the case of SSA. Subsequently, Shamim (2007)  examined the impact of ICT on financial sector development for 61 countries over the 1990–2002 period. They found that mobile phones and Internet subscriptions have a strong positive effect on financial depth. Using a sample of 72 countries, Cheng et al. (2021)  investigated the relationship between financial sector development, ICT, and economic growth over the 2000–2015 period. They have demonstrated that the interplay between ICT and financial sector development positively impacts economic growth in middle and low-income-level countries. Recently, Abeka et al. (2021)  have argued that developing the financial sector stimulates economic growth in SSA since it has a robust telecommunication infrastructure. A closer look at the link between ICT, sustainable development, and financial development reveals certain shortcomings. On the one hand, we observed a large body of literature about the impact of ICT on economic and environmental sustainability. Yet, its effect on social sustainability seems rarely addressed in the literature. In addition, the results about the ICT impact on environmental sustainability look inconclusive. Thus, it is important to carry out another study in this field, especially in SSA. Furthermore, the question about the impact of ICT on the three dimensions of the 17 sustainable developments has never been addressed in any integrated study. On the other hand, the impact of ICT on financial sector development remains limited. This could be explained by the fact that the ICT revolution was still in its infancy when their study was conducted. The above-discussed theoretical arguments show that ICT is a crucial correlation between financial sector development and sustainable development. To our knowledge, no prior study has analyzed the joint effects of ICT and financial development on the three dimensions of the 17 SDGs in SSA at both aggregate and disaggregate levels. To fill these gaps, we assume that ICT promotes financial sector development, which in turn makes sustainable development. Hence, we propose the following hypothesis:Hypothesis 2 ICT boosts financial sector development for achieving the SDGs in SSA at both aggregate and disaggregate levels.   In light of the above arguments and hypothesis, we propose the following conceptual model of study:    3 Data and methodological approach 3.1 Data Based on the two hypotheses mentioned above, this research uses annual and unbalanced panel data to examine the role of ICT in developing the financial sector to achieve the SDGs at the aggregate and disaggregate levels (economic, social, and environmental sustainability) in 48 SSA countries during the 2000–2018 period.1  1 The choice of period and the number of countries were determined by the availability of data.   More details about the list of countries will be presented in Table A in the appendices. The datasets were gathered from the World Development Indicators (WDI), The World Bank’s Global Financial sector development Database (GFD), and the Standardized World Income Inequality Database (SWIID). We have divided this subsection into three parts for more details about the construction and the used variables. First, we describe the construction of the sustainable development indices. Second, we outline the construction of the financial sector development indices. Finally, we present the ICT indicator and the control variables. 3.1.1 Construction of the sustainable development index (SDI) We calculated the three dimensions of sustainability based on the 17 SDGs using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA).  Table 1  shows all of the 17 SDGs indicators' measurements and sources. A composite index is a group of indicators with no standard unit of measure or a clear way to assign their weights (Dhahri et al., 2021 ). The construction of each composite indicator must have a well-defined objective by following a generally accepted set of measures (Dhahri et al., 2021 ). These steps are structured as follows: • Theoretical framework formulation : In 2012, at the UN Rio+ 20 Summit, governments decided to develop an integrated set of SDGs to close the gaps of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In 2015, the UN General Assembly officially endorsed the “2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development , " including 17 SDGs (UN, 2015). From this perspective, Costanza et al. (2016)  have classified the 17 SDGs under three dimensions to provide an overall measurement and understanding of sustainable development (see Table 1 ). Barbier and Burgess (2019)  argued that choosing an appropriate indicator for each objective is difficult. • Missing data calculation:  A composite indicator must have complete data to be robust. There are three possible imputation techniques to fill the missing data: (i) omitting observations with missing data; (ii) substituting individual imputation with mean or median or regression; and (iii) multiple assumptions. The missing data for this study were completed using a simple mean-replacement imputation. • Data standardization : the standardization of indicators is crucial because some of them can be positively or negatively correlated with the measured phenomenon. There are also many data standardization methods. In this study, we applied the MIN MAX method to solve this issue. The data standardization (Min-Max) is presented in Eqs. (1) and (2)  as follows:(1) X  t , i , j   = X ′  t , i , j   − X ′  t , min , j    X ′  t , max , j   − X ′  t , min , j         (2) X  t , i , j   = 1 − X ′  t , i , j   − X ′  t , min , j    X ′  t , max , j   − X ′  t , min , j         where X  t , i , j     is the observed value for the variable i measured on the spatial unit j in the year t, X′  t , min , j    , X′  t , max , j    , which represent the minimum and maximum values for the variable i measured in all the spatial units j, respectively. We applied Eq. (1)  to variables that positively relate to sustainability. However, Eq. (2)  was applied to variables that negatively relate to sustainability.• Weighting and aggregation of the composite index:  we used the principal component analysis to reduce a large set of correlated variables to a small set of uncorrelated ones, known as the principal components. This process aimed to explain the variance of observed data across linear sets of the original data (Abou-Ali and Abdelfattah, 2013 ).    The general form of the principal component is presented in Eq. (3)  as follows:(3) PC  p   = b  1  p   X  1  p   + … + b  n  p   X  n  p       where PC  p     is the P principal component, b  n  p      is the regression coefficient of the n variables of the P  th     component, and X  n  p     is the value of the n variables. There are two steps before the PC's storage for PCA analysis adequacy. The first one is to estimate representative data adequacy using two statistical tests: (i) the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test, which allows testing the sample adequacy with any value greater than 0.50. (ii) The test of Bartlett's Sphericity, where the level of significance must have a value less than 0.5 (p-value < 0.5) (Abou-Ali and Abdelfattah, 2013 ). The second step is to choose the number of principal components using two criteria: (i) the cumulative variance explained at least 60–70% of the total information; (ii) the principal components that have an eigenvalue higher than one (Kaiser, 1960 ).2  2 After we identified the number of components to be extracted for the three dimensions of sustainability, we rotate them using the Varimax rotation with Kaiser Normalization to correct the cross loading only for the components 1 and 2 of economic dimension, for the components 1,2,3,4 of the social dimension, and for the components 1 and 2 of the environmental dimension.    Table 2  presents the construction of the Sustainable Development Index (SDI ). The economic dimension is calculated using two selected PCs (economic1 and economic2), which explained 61.319% of the total variance. The social dimension is examined using four selected PCs (social1, social2, social3, and social4), which accounted for 61.399% of the total variation. The environmental dimension is evaluated using two PCs (envirnmt1 and envirnmt2), which explained 69.016% of the total variance. We calculated the weighted average of the selected PCs using Eq. (4)  as follows:(4) I  p   = ∑ i = 1  m   F  Pi   * λ  i     ∑ i = 1  m   λ  i          Where Ip  is the sustainability index, which represents the weighted average of m PC values for the unit p. Fpi  indicates the value of the I  th     PC for the unit p, while λ  i     denotes the Eigenvalue of the I  th     PC. The SDI is calculated for each country as the simple arithmetic mean of the three indices (Sagar and Najam, 1998; UNDP, 2008 ). The SDI  formula of the three indices (economic, social, and environmental dimensions) is presented in Equation (5) as above: The calculations of these indices are presented in Eqs. (6), (7), and (8) , respectively, as follows: SDI =  1/3 *economic dimension+ 1/3 * social dimention+ 1/3 *environnemental dimension (5). Where,(6) Economic dimension = (1·530* economic1+ 1·036* economic2)/2·566   (7) Social dimension = 1·982*social1+1·762*social2+1·168*social3+1·015*social4)/5·927   (8) Environnemental dimension = (1·563*envirnmt1+1·198*envirnmt2)/2·761)     3.1.2 Construction of the financial sector development indices As the financial sector development has multidimensional aspects, we used eight financial indicators, reflecting the four financial dimensions, i.e., financial depth, financial inclusion, financial efficiency, and financial stability. The financial depth is measured by four indicators which are the domestic credit to the private sector (DC ), deposit bank assets (DB ), money supply (MS ), and liquid liabilities (LL ). These are expressed as a share of GDP. Financial inclusion is measured by the number of automatic teller machines per 100,000 adults (AM ). Financial efficiency is measured with the bank's net interest margin as a percentage (BM ). Financial stability is measured with two indicators: the bank's Z-score (BZ ) and the bank's ratio of non-performing loans to gross loans in percentage (BL ). These variables have been gathered from the World Bank’s Global Financial Sector Development Dataset. We followed the same approach by Kassi et al. (2020)  to construct the composite financial sector development indices.3  3 For more details about the definition, justification and description of the different financial variables (see Kassi et al., 2020 ).   Their technique has been adopted by several studies thanks to its relevance in analyzing complex, correlated, and multidimensional variables (Asongu and Odhiambo, 2020 , among others). Thus, following Cheng et al. (2021) , we constructed three composite financial sector development indices using the PCA method. The first composite index of financial sector development (FSI 1 ) represents the financial depth, which is composed of the variables DC , DB , MS,  and LL . The second composite index of financial sector development (FSI 2 ) includes a financial depth indicator DC , a financial inclusion indicator AM , a financial efficiency indicator BM  and a financial stability indicator BL . The third composite index of financial sector development (FSI 3 ) comprises the bank's Z-score financial stability indicator, a DC  indicator, an AM  indicator and a BM  indicator. The results in  Table 3  about the construction of the financial sector development indices show that the first component (PC1) is the only component retained for FSI 1 , FSI 2 , and FSI 3  because their cumulative variance represents more than 60% of the total information, respectively. Moreover, following the Kaiser-Guttman rule, the first component for the three financial development indices has an eigenvalue greater than one.4  4 After we identified the number of components to be extracted for the three indexes, we rotate them using the Varimax rotation with Kaiser Normalization to correct the cross-loading only for component 1 for the indexes 1, 2 and 3 of the financial sector development.    3.1.3 ICT and control variables In this study, we used mobile phone and Internet use subscriptions for 100 people as a proxy of ICT . We have also included a set of control variables to reduce the concerns about the omitted variable bias. These variables are GDP growth, which is measured by annual percentage (GDP ); foreign direct investment, which is measured by net inflows as a share of GDP (FDI) , remittances measured as a share of GDP (R ); trade openness, measured by total imports plus exports of goods and services as a share of GDP (TO ), and rule of law (RL ). All these variables were collected from the WDI statistics except RL, gathered from World Wide Governance Indicators (WGI). Overall, we expect a positive impact of ICT  on the financial sector development to achieve the 17 SDGs. Besides, we assume that the impact of the control variables on the three dimensions of sustainability could be mixed at the aggregate and disaggregate levels. The summary statistics of the variables using the global panel are provided in  Table 4 . The sustainable development dimensions statistics show that the average value of economic sustainability represents about 40%, social sustainability accounted for about 30%, and environmental sustainability represents about 30%. The ICT  statistics reveal that the average rate of mobile phone use is about 51 per 100 people. However, the use of the Internet represents about 10 per 100 people. The financial sector development statistics indicate that the average DC  represents about 22% as a share of GDP, the average DB  represents about 25% as a share of GDP, the average MS  represents about 13% as a share of GDP, the average LL  represents about 31% as a share of GDP, the average AM  represents about 9.4% per 100,000 adults, and the average BM  represents about 6%, the average BZ  represents about 10.5%, and the average BL  represents about 4.2%. . Generally,  Fig. 2  shows increased ICT  diffusion in SSA countries during the 2000–2018 period. Specifically, we have noticed that mobile phone subscriptions appear superior to internet use subscriptions, where about 4.5% of 100 people have access to mobile phones. Nevertheless, about 3% of 100 people have access to the Internet.  Fig. 3  shows the evolution of financial development indices using the same sample. Therefore, we have noticed that FSI 2  has a higher level than FSI 1  and FSI 3 . FSI 2  increased by approximately 0.44% in 2000 to around 0.47% in 2018. However, financial development indexes 1 and 3 have decreased from around 0.43% in 2000 to approximately 0.35% and 0.38%, respectively, in 2018.  Fig. 4  demonstrates the evolution of SDI . Accordingly, we have noticed that SDI  decreased from 0.44% in 2000 to 0.32% in 2017, but after that, it reached around 0.37% in 2018.  Fig. 5  represents the evolution of the three dimensions of sustainable development. We have observed a decrease in economic sustainability from 0.41% in 2000 to about 0.32% in 2018, a decrease in social sustainability from 0.46% in 2000 to 27% in 2016, and a decrease in environmental sustainability from 0.43% in 2000 to 0.36% in 2017. The details on the description, abbreviations, and sources of the used variables are presented in Table B in the appendices.   3.2 Methodological approach 3.2.1 Model specifications We have proposed the following model to investigate the role of ICT  in developing the financial sector for achieving the SDGs at the aggregate and disaggregate levels for 48 SSA countries during the 2000–2018 period. More formally, Eq. (9)  presents the specifications of the proposed model:(9) Y  it   = α  0   + α  1   FS  it   + α  2   ICT  it   + α  3   FS  it   * ICT  it   + α  4   ∑ j = 1  K   δ  j    X  jit  ′   + τ  i   + ε  it        where Y  refers to the sustainable development dimensions (economic, social, and environmental sustainability). FS  is the financial sector development, represented by the financial depth (DC , DB , MS , and LL ), financial efficiency (BM ), financial inclusion (AM ), and financial stability (BZ  and BL ), respectively. ICT  is represented by mobile phone and internet use subscriptions. ICT*FS  is the interaction between ICT  and the financial sector development. X  is the vector of control variables (GDP, FDI, R, TO, RL ). Where i = 1,.,48 for each country in the panel, t = 2000;…;2018 refers to the period, α 0  is the constant, τ  i     is the country-specific effect, and εit  represents the white noise stochastic disturbance term. The coefficients α 1 , α 2 , α 3 , and α 4  are the long-run estimated coefficient of FD  it   , ICT  it   , FD  it   * ICT  it    and X  jit  ′     , respectively. We used logarithmic transformations for all the variables except for sustainable development, financial sector development, and the rule of law. Therefore, we expect that the eight variables representing the four dimensions of FS  will have opposite spillover effects on the three dimensions of sustainable development. For the ICT  coefficient, we expect that mobile phone and Internet use seem to encourage sustainable development dimensions. For the interaction effect between FS  and ICT , measured with a coefficient, we expect that mobile phone and internet use will increase FS , which, in turn, boosts economic, social, and environmental sustainability. Furthermore, we expect that the effect of the mobile phone will promote FS  more than internet use in achieving sustainable development.  3.2.2 Estimation procedures Before estimating our empirical mode, we must check the presence of cross-sectional dependence in our model using Breusch-Pagan (1980) , Friedman (1937) , and Pesaran (2004)  tests first, which allow us to choose between the first and the second-generation panel unit root tests. According to the results in Table C in the appendices, the null of cross-sectional independence has been accepted for all the variables in the estimated model of SSA. In this case, we applied the first-generation panel unit root tests, LLC (Levin et al., 2002 ) and IPS (Im et al., 2003 ). These tests are based on the ADF principle statistics. Nonetheless, LLC assumes homogeneity in the autoregressive coefficients dynamics for all panel members. Yet, IPS admits to heterogeneity in them. The null hypothesis has drawn that the whole series is non-stationary versus the alternative hypothesis that only a fragment of the series is stationary. The results of these two tests are reported in Table D in the appendices showing that all the used variables are integrated at order one (I), which allows us to test the long-run equilibrium relationships among variables using Kao (1999)  and Pedroni (1999, 2004)  panel cointegration tests. Table E in the appendices has reported the results of these no cointegration tests, which cannot be rejected, indicating that the variables included in the models are not cointegrated, so we cannot run the long-run estimates. Therefore, we suggest using the System Generalized Method of Moments (sys-GMM) method to test our model to demonstrate the importance of ICT in developing the financial sector for sustainable development in SSA countries. Indeed, three main reasons lead us to use the sys-GMM technique. First, the number of countries (N = 48) is greater than the number of years in each country (T = 18). This condition is satisfactory in our case (N > T). Second, Sys-GMM estimation addresses the heteroscedasticity issues, while difference-GMM is consistent with homoscedasticity. Additionally, the Sys-GMM makes combining the equations in first differences and levels possible so that the variables will be instrumented econometrically by their first differences. Third, this technique addresses the endogeneity problems produced by the causality of reservations between variables, especially when the independent variables are macroeconomic and institutional. For example, two-way causality may exist between economic growth and financial sector development (Fowowe, 2011; Guptha and Rao, 2018 ), education and financial sector development (Hatemi-J and Shamsuddin, 2016; Zaidi et al., 2019 ), CO2  and financial sector development (Xu et al., 2018; Shahbaz et al., 2020 ), economic growth and ICT (Pradhan et al., 2021; Appiah-Otoo and Song, 2021 ), health and ICT (Flick et al., 2020 ), CO2  and ICT (Shehzad et al., 2020 ), ICT and financial sector development (Pradhan et al., 2015 ). Subsequently, Sys-GMM is the ideal technique to deal with these problems and ensure the reliability of our estimate. To account for the possibility of endogeneity, we used Eq. (1) . Thus, Eq. (10)  of the standard Sys-GMM models in level and Eq. (11)  of the difference-GMM are represented as follows:(10) Y  it   = α  0   + α  1   Y  it − 1   + α  2   FS  it   + α  3   ICT  it   + α  4   FS  it   * ICT  it   + α  5   ∑ j = 1  K   δ  j    X  jit  ′   + µ  i   + τ  i   + ε  it       (11) Y  it   − Y  it − 1   = α  1   ( Y  it − 1   − Y  it − 2   ) + α  2   ( FS  it   − FS  it − 1   ) + α  3   ( ICT  it   − ICT  it − 1   ) + α  4   ( FS  it   * ICT  it   − FS  it   * ICT  it − 1   ) + α  5   ∑ j = 1  K   δ  j    ( X  jit  ′   − X  jit − 1  ′   ) + ( τ  i   − τ  i − 1   ) + ε  it − 1       where Yit-15  5 To select the appropriate lag for our model we run the VAR model. However, we found that the financial sector development and ICT would affect sustainable development dimensions after one year.   represents the lagged value of the dependent variable for country i over the period t. Still, including a lagged dependent variable Yit-1 as an independent variable violates the orthogonality assumption between the error term and the lagged dependent variable, both at the first difference and a level. To address this issue, Arellano and Bond (1991)  have advocated using the standard or Diff-GMM estimator. This technique proposes differencing Eqs. (10) and (11)  to eliminate the country-specific effects. However, the correlation problem between the error term and the lagged dependent variables requires instrumental variables (Arellano and Bond, 1991 ). Blundell and Bond (1998)  have indicated that the lagged value of an independent variable is a weak equation instrument in first differences. Furthermore, the intra-country variations were not taken into consideration in this differentiation. Blundell and Bond (1998)  have suggested using the Sys-GMM method to solve these problems. In the GMM framework, post-estimation diagnostics require a set of tests to check the overall validity of instrumental variables and serial correlation and examine the accuracy of the GMM estimation, especially with the lagged regression coefficient and relative to pooled OLS and within-group (fixed effects) estimates. Therefore, to demonstrate the robustness of the system's GMM estimates, it is necessary to report the Pooled OLS and the fixed effect model estimates about the impact of ICT and eight financial sector development indicators on SDI and the economic, social, and environmental sustainability of the 48 SSA countries. The parameter estimate of the lagged dependent variable must fall between the values of the Pooled OLS and the fixed-effect model.    4 Empirical results and discussions 4.1 Results at the disaggregated level   Tables 5 and 6  present the results of the moderating effect of two ICT types (mobile phone and internet use) on the relationship between financial sector development dimensions and economic sustainability. Hence, four main results could be derived. First, as expected, most of the estimated models show that both types of ICT  have significant positive effects on economic sustainability. For example, economic sustainability is positively affected by mobile phone and Internet use, going from 0.037% to 0.337% for mobile phones and from 0.169% to 0.303% for Internet use. These results align with the finding of Donou-Adonsou (2019) , who argue that mobile phones and Internet use significantly impact economic growth. Second, regarding the financial sector development indicators, only lnDB,  lnLL,  and lnBZ  are relevant in increasing economic sustainability in the mobile phone model. However, in the model of internet use, lnDB, lnLL, lnBM, lnAM, and lnBZ  drive the empirical association between financial sector development and economic sustainability. These results are in line with Hussein et al. (2020) , which found that liquid liabilities to the private sector have a direct positive effect on economic growth in the long term and a negative effect in the short term. These results suggest that policymakers need to increase liquidity by offering electronic banking services to increase substantial private investment and encourage long-term economic growth. In addition, a positive relationship was found between economic development, digital financial inclusion, and bank stability (Z-score) (Chinoda and Kapingura, 2023 ). These authors have shown that promoting digital financial inclusion and financial stability in a country plays a crucial role in achieving the SDGs and higher economic growth. Thus, financial depth and financial stability increase economic sustainability from 0.013% to 0.387% for the mobile phone model. However, for the Internet use model, financial depth, efficiency, inclusion, and stability are from 0.012% to 0.623%. Similarly, Cheng et al. (2021)  document that the financial sector can gather savings, allocate resources to the most productive investments, reduce information and transaction costs, and foster inter-industry trade. Third, we emphasize an interesting gap in the prior literature on the financial sector development-sustainable development nexus, which examines the net impact on economic sustainability from the interplays between ICT and economic sustainability. On the one hand, the net effects of the interactions between mobile phones and the dimensions of financial sector development on economic sustainability are computed. Since only the proxies lnDB, lnMS, lnAM, lnBL, and lnBZ  are significant. We computed the net effects only for these five indicators. For example, the second column of Table 5  shows that a 1% increase in lnDB  marginally raises economic sustainability around 4.131% [i.e., (0.162 ×24.844) + 0.106] at the average value of a mobile phone. In this computation, 0.162 is the conditional impact from the interaction between lnDB  and the mobile phone, 24.844 is the mean value of lnDB , and 0.106 is the unconditional impact of the mobile phone. For each regression, a positive net impact means the complementarity hypothesis between mobile phones and financial sector development in promoting economic sustainability is validated. In contrast, a negative net impact indicates that the tested hypothesis is rejected. It is evident from Table 5  that the net impacts on economic sustainability from the interplays between mobile phones and five out of eight indicators of financial sector development are positive. This result indicates that increasing mobile phone boosts financial sector development (financial depth, financial inclusion, and financial stability) in SSA countries (Evans, 2018; Abeka et al., 2021; Ejemeyovwi et al., 2021 ), which, in turn, encourages economic sustainability (Taddese Bekele and Abebaw Degu, 2023 ). On the other hand, net effects from the interaction between Internet use and the dimensions of financial sector development on economic sustainability are computed to measure the global effect of this interaction. Since only the indicators lnDB , lnBM , lnAM , and score are significant, we computed the net effects only for these four proxies. For instance, the second column of Table 6  shows that a 1% increase in lnDB  marginally raises economic sustainability around 3.11% [i.e., (0.113 ×24.844) + (0.303)] at the average value of Internet use. In this computation, 0.113 is the conditional impact from the interaction between lnDB  and Internet use, 24.844 is the mean value of lnda, and 0.303 is the unconditional impact of Internet use. For each regression, a positive net impact indicates that the complementarity hypothesis between Internet use and financial sector development in promoting economic sustainability is validated. In contrast, a negative net impact indicates that the tested hypothesis is rejected. A positive net impact means Internet use complements financial sector development to increase economic sustainability. It is clear from Table 6  that the net impacts on economic sustainability from the interplays between Internet use and four out of eight proxies of financial sector development are positive. This result indicates that increasing Internet use in SSA countries leads to more financial sector development (depth, efficiency, inclusion, and stability) (Owusu-Agyei et al., 2020; Chien et al., 2020 ) which, in turn, encourages economic sustainability. Finally, regarding the control variables, economic sustainability is positively influenced by the growth of GDP, FDI, R, TO, and RL.   Tables 7 and 8  report the interaction effects of two types of ICT and financial sector development indicators on social sustainability. Four main results could be derived from these tables. First, as expected, most of the estimated models show that both types of ICT have contradictory effects on social sustainability, i.e., social sustainability is affected positively by mobile phones and negatively by Internet use, going from 0.018% to 0.327% for mobile phone indicators and from − 0.114 to − 0.008% for the Internet use indicators. These results confirm the findings of Adams and Akobeng (2021) , who argue that Internet and mobile cellular subscription directly reduce inequality in Africa and that good governance indicators can strengthen the ICT and inequality relationship. Second, regarding the financial sector development indicators, only lnDC lnDB, lnAM, lnBL, and lnBZ  are respectively pertaining. Thus, financial sector development increases social sustainability from 0.045% to 0.269% for mobile phones and from 0.008% to 0.066% for Internet use. Thus, lnDC, lnDB, lnAM, lnBL, and lnBZ  drive/lead the empirical association between financial sector development and social sustainability for the mobile phone mode. This result is consistent with the findings of Asongu et al. (2021) , who found that financial stability represented by Z-Score modulates inclusive education for women to empower female employment in industrial distribution. Thus, financial stability appears as a policy perspective that can address gender economic exclusion and promote inclusive development in SSA countries. Moreover, Ozili (2023)  found that non-performing loans (NPLs) are positively associated with the level of sustainability measured with the sustainability index (SDI). They found a significant positive relationship between NLPs and the SDG10 of “reducing inequalities” in African countries. The authors claimed that banks lend to high-risk SDG10-related activities to signal their commitment to the SDGs, which in turn serves to increase non-performing loans. Nonetheless, lnDB , lnMS , and lnBM  drive the empirical association between financial sector development and social sustainability for the Internet use model. Third, we emphasize an interesting gap in the prior literature on the financial sector development-sustainable development nexus, which examines the net impact on social sustainability from the interplays between ICT and social sustainability. On the one hand, net effects from the interactions between mobile phones and the indicators of financial sector development on social sustainability are computed. Since only the proxies lnDB, lnDC , lnBM , lnAM , lnBL,  and lnBZ  are significant, we computed the net effects only for these indicators. For example, the fifth column of Table 7  shows that a 1% increase in lnBM  marginally raises social sustainability around 0.453% [i.e., (0.062 ×5.865) + 0.09] at the average value of mobile phones. In this computation, 0.062 is the conditional impact from the interaction between lnBM  and the mobile phone, 5.865 is the mean value of lnBM , and 0.09 is the unconditional impact of the mobile phone. This result is in line with the findings of Claeys and Vennet (2008) , who found that a high net interest margin reflects low banking efficiency and an uncompetitive banking market. Banking sectors in Sub-Saharan Africa remain concentrated with limited competition, hence low bank efficiency and high net interest margins (Sarpong-Kumankoma et al., 2020 ). To solve these issues, Saksonova (2014)  recommended that the net interest margin may decline with great competition or financial and technological innovations that increase banking efficiency. For each regression, a positive net impact means the complementarity hypothesis between financial sector development and mobile phone in promoting social sustainability is validated. In contrast, a negative net impact indicates that the tested hypothesis is rejected. It is apparent from Table 7  that the net impacts on social sustainability from the interplays between mobile phones and six out of eight indicators of financial sector development are positive, indicating that increasing mobile phone leads them to attract more financial sector development (depth, efficiency, inclusion, and stability) in SSA countries which, in turn, encourages social sustainability (Tchamyou, 2020 ; Omar et al., 2020 ). On the other hand, net effects from the interaction between Internet use and the indicators of financial sector development on social sustainability are computed to measure the global effect of this interaction. Since only the indicators lnDB , lnLL , lnBM , lnBL , and lnBZ  are significant, we have computed the net effects only for these five proxies. For instance, the fifth column of Table 8  shows that a 1% increase in lnBM  marginally raises social sustainability around 0.06% [i.e., (0.012 ×5.685) + (−0.008)] at the average value of Internet use. In this computation, 0.012 is the conditional impact from the interaction between lnBZ  and Internet use, 5.658 is the mean value of lnBM  and − 0.008 is the unconditional impact of Internet use. For each regression, a positive net impact means that the complementarity hypothesis between financial sector development and Internet use in promoting sustainable development is validated, whereas a negative net impact indicates that the tested hypothesis is rejected. A positive net impact means Internet use complements financial sector development to increase social sustainability. It is clear from Table 8  that the net effects of social sustainability from the interplays between Internet use and five out of eight proxies of financial sector development are positive, indicating that increasing Internet use significantly annihilates the harmful effects of financial sector development (depth, efficiency, and stability) in SSA countries which, in turn, support social sustainability (Kelikume, 2021 ). Finally, regarding the control variables, financial sector development is positively influenced by the growth of GDP, FDI, R, and the RL, while TO negatively impacts social sustainability.   Tables 9 and 10  present the interaction effects of both types of ICT and the indicators of financial sector development on environmental sustainability. Four main results could be derived from these tables. First, as expected, we found that both types of ICT exert contradictory spillover effects on environmental sustainability, i.e., environmental sustainability is influenced negatively by mobile phones and positively by Internet use. This finding is in line with Asongu et al. (2018) , who find that environmental sustainability is influenced positively by Internet use and negatively by mobile phones. Second, regarding the impacts of financial sector development indicators, only lnDB , lnMS , and lnBM  increases environmental sustainability, going from − 0.626 to − 0.038% for the mobile phone model. However, for the impacts of financial sector development indicators, only lnDC , lnMS , lnAM , lnBL , and lnBZ  increase environmental sustainability, running from − 0.466 to − 0.031% for the Internet use model. Third, we concentrate on another gap in the existing research, which analyzes the net impacts on environmental sustainability from the interplay between ICT and financial sector development. For the mobile phone model, net effects from the interplays between mobile phones and the five indicators of financial sector development on environmental sustainability are computed to measure the overall impact of these interactions. Since only the models are respectively related to lnDB , lnMS , lnBM , lnBL , and lnBZ,  we computed the net effects only for these five models. For instance, the fifth column of Table 9  shows that a 1% increase in lnBM  marginally raises environmental sustainability around 0.376% [i.e., (0.094 ×5.865) + (−0.175)] at the average value of the mobile phones. In this computation, 0.094 is the conditional impact from lnBM  and mobile phone, 5.865 is the mean value of lnBM , and − 0.175 is the unconditional impact of the mobile phone. For each regression, a positive net impact signifies that the complementarity hypothesis between mobile phone and financial sector development in promoting environmental sustainability is validated, whereas a negative net impact indicates that the tested hypothesis is rejected. Our results show that the net impacts on environmental sustainability from the interplays between mobile phones and five out of eight indicators of financial sector development are positive, indicating that better financial sector development (depth, efficiency, and inclusion) wipes out the detrimental effects of mobile phone in SSA, which, in turn, encourages environmental sustainability (Avom et al., 2020 ). Regarding the Internet use model, net effects from the interplays between Internet use and the indicators of financial sector development on environmental sustainability are computed to measure the global impact of these interplays. Since only lnDC , lnDB , lnMS , lnLL , lnBM , lnAM , and lnBL  are significant, we computed the net effects only for these seven models. For instance, the seventh column of Table 10  shows that a 1% increase in lnBL  marginally raising environmental sustainability is around 0.770% [i.e., (0.169 ×4.299) + (0.043)] at the average value of Internet use. A negative net impact means Internet use complements financial sector development to increase environmental sustainability. We can see from Table 10  that the net effects from the interplay between Internet use and seven out of eight indicators of financial sector development on sustainable development are positive, indicating that increasing Internet use leads to increase financial sector development (depth, efficiency, inclusion, and stability) in SSA (Owusu-Agyei et al., 2020 ), which, in turn, encourages environmental sustainability (Park al, 2018 ). Finally, regarding the control variables, the rate of environmental sustainability decreases with the increase in the rate of GDP, FDI, and TO, while it only increases with the rise in R and the RL.  4.2 Results at the aggregated level The interaction impacts of two types of ICT and three financial sector development indices on the sustainable development index are presented in  Table 11 . In addition, four main results could be derived. First, as expected, most of the estimated models show that both types of ICT have positive effects on the sustainable development index, i.e., the sustainable development index is positively affected by mobile phone and Internet use, going from 0.051% to 0.231% for mobile phone indicators and from 0.021% to 0.028% for the Internet use indicators. In this context, scholars such as Appiah-Otoo and Song (2021)  argue that ICT increases economic growth, but poor countries benefit more from the ICT revolution than rich countries. Asongu and Odhiambo (2020)  found that mobile phone and Internet penetration rates mitigate low-quality education. Khan et al. (2020)  found that ICT reduces CO2  emissions. Second, regarding the financial sector development indicators, only financial sector development indexes 1 and 2 are pertaining, respectively. Therefore, financial sector development increases the sustainable development index from 0.117% to 0.694% for mobile phones and from 0.004% to 0.183% for Internet use. The authors document that financial sector development indexes 1 and 2 drive the empirical association between financial sector development and sustainability. Similarly, according to Tchamyou et al. (2019) , financial depth and size are established to alleviate inequality dependent on ICT. Aluko and Obalade (2020)  state that increased financial development improves environmental quality (CO2  emissions reduction). Third, we emphasize an interesting gap in the prior literature on the financial sector development and sustainable development nexus, which examines the net impact on the sustainable development index from the interplays between ICT and financial sector development indexes. On the one hand, the net effects of the interactions between mobile phones and the indicators of financial sector development on the sustainable development index are computed. Since only all of the proxies FSI 1 , FSI 2,  and FSI 3  are significant; we computed the net effects for these indices. For example, the first column of Table 11  shows that a 1% increase in FSI 1  raises the sustainable development index around 0.074% [i.e., (0.065 ×0.351) + 0.051] at the average value of the mobile phone. In this computation, 0.065 is the conditional impact from the interaction between the mobile phone and FSI 1 , 0.351 is the mean value of FSI 1 , and 0.051 is the unconditional impact of the mobile phone. For each regression, a positive net impact means that the complementarity hypothesis between mobile phone and financial sector development in promoting sustainable development index is validated, whereas a negative net impact indicates that the tested hypothesis is rejected. It is apparent from Table 11  that the net impacts on the sustainable development index from the interplays between mobile phones and the three financial sector development indexes are positive, indicating that increasing mobile phone leads them to attract more financial sector development (depth, efficiency, inclusion, and stability) in SSA countries (Chien et al., 2020; Owusu-Agyei et al., 2020; Asongu et al., 2021 ), which, in turn, encourages sustainable development index (Kirikkaleli and Adebayo, 2021 ). On the other hand, net effects from the interaction between Internet use and the indexes of financial sector development on the sustainable development index are computed to measure the global effect of this interaction. Since all the indices of financial sector development are significant, we computed the net effects for all of them. For instance, the fourth column of Table 11  shows that a 1% increase in FSI 1  raises the sustainable development index around 0.356% [i.e., (0.246 ×0.351) + (0.27)] at the average value of Internet use. In this computation, 0.246 is the conditional impact from the interaction between Internet use and FSI 1 , 0.351 is the mean value of FSI 1 , and 0.27 is the unconditional impact of Internet use. In this computation, 0.246 is the conditional impact from the interaction between Internet use and FSI 1 , 0.351 is the mean value of FSI 1 , and 0.27 is the unconditional impact of Internet use. For each regression, a positive net impact means that the complementarity hypothesis between Internet use and financial sector development in promoting sustainable development index is validated, whereas a negative net impact indicates that the tested hypothesis is rejected. A positive net impact means Internet use complements financial sector development to increase the sustainable development index. It is clear from Table 11  that the net effects from the interplays between Internet use and the three indices of financial sector development on sustainable development are positive, indicating that increasing Internet use significantly raises financial sector development (depth, efficiency, and stability) in SSA countries (Evans, 2018; Ejemeyovwi et al., 2021 ) which, in turn, encourages sustainable development (Aluko and Obalade, 2020; Bolarinwa et al., 2022 ). Finally, regarding the control variables, the financial sector development is positively influenced by the growth of GDP, FDI, R, and the RL, while TO shows a negative impact on sustainable development.  4.3 Robustness check As a robustness check of the obtained results and to deal with cross-country heterogeneity in our sample, we also estimated our empirical model for two sub-samples: low- and middle-income countries. The joint effects of two types of ICT and three financial sector development indices on the sustainable development index in low and middle-income SSA countries are reported in   Tables 12 and 13 . Four main results could be derived from Table 12 . First, as expected, most of the estimated models show that both types of ICT have positive effects on the sustainable development index in low-income countries, i.e., the sustainable development index is positively affected by mobile phone and Internet use, going from 0.099% to 0.046% for the mobile phone indicators and from 0.348% to 0.067% for the Internet use indicators. Second, regarding the financial sector development indicators, only financial sector development index 2 is pertaining. Thus, financial sector development increases the sustainable development index, from 0.171% for mobile phones to 0.09% for Internet use. On the one hand, the net effects of mobile phone contacts with financial sector development indicators on the sustainable development index are computed. Since only all the proxy FSI 2  is significant, we computed the net effects for these indices. For example, column 1 of Table 12  indicates that a 1% rise in FSI 2  raises the sustainable development index around 0.114% [i.e., (0.036 ×0.405) + 0.099] at the average value of the mobile phone. In this computation, 0.036 is the conditional impact from the interaction between the mobile phone and FSI 1 , 0.405 represents the mean value of FSI 1 , and 0.099 is the mobile phone's unconditional impact. For each regression, a positive net impact means that the complementarity hypothesis between mobile phone and financial sector development in promoting sustainable development index is validated, whereas a negative net impact indicates that the tested hypothesis is rejected. It is noticeable from Table 12  that the net impact on the sustainable development index from the interplays between mobile phones and the financial sector development index 2 is positive, indicating that increasing mobile phone leads them to attract more financial sector development (depth, efficiency, inclusion, and stability) in low-income SSA countries, which, in turn, encourages sustainable development index. On the other hand, net effects from the interaction between Internet use and the indexes of financial sector development on the sustainable development index are computed to measure the global effect of this interaction. Since financial sector development 2 is significant, we computed the net effects only for it. For instance, column four/4 of Table 12  shows that at the average value of Internet use, a 1% rise in FSI 2  boosts the sustainable development index by 0.076%/ % [i.e., (0.023 ×0.405) + (0.067)]. In this computation, 0.023 is the conditional impact from the interaction between Internet use and FSI 2 , 0.405 represents the mean value of FSI 2 , and 0.067 indicates the unconditional impact of Internet use. A positive net impact for each regression shows that the complementarity hypothesis between Internet use and financial sector development 2 in boosting sustainable development index has been verified, whereas a negative net impact implies that the tested hypothesis has been rejected. A positive net impact means Internet use complements financial sector development to increase the sustainable development index. It is clear from Table 12  that the net effects from the interplays between Internet use and the index of financial sector development 2 on sustainable development are positive, indicating that increasing Internet use significantly raises financial sector development (depth, efficiency, and stability) in low- income SSA countries, which, in turn, encourages sustainable development. Finally, regarding control variables, the financial sector development is positively influenced by the growth of GDP, FDI, R, and the RL, while TO negatively impacts sustainable development. Four main results could be derived from Table 13 . First, as expected, most of the estimated models show that both types of ICT have positive effects on the sustainable development index in middle-income SSA countries, i.e., the sustainable development index is positively affected by mobile phone and internet use, going from 0.031% to 0.07% for the mobile phone indicators and from 0.03% to 0.057% for the internet use. Second, regarding the financial sector development indicators, only financial sector development index 2 is pertaining. Thus, financial sector development increases the sustainable development index from 0.102% to 0.326% for mobile phones and from 0.027% to 0.061% for internet use. On the one hand, the net effects from the interactions between mobile phones and the indexes of financial sector development on the sustainable development index are computed. Since only all the proxy FSI 3  is significant, we computed the net effects for these indices. Table 13 's third column shows that a 1% rise in FSI 3  boosts the sustainable development index by 0.084%/% [i.e., (0.036 ×0.391) + 0.07] at the average mobile phone value. In this computation, 0.015 is the conditional impact from the interaction between the mobile phone and FSI 3 , 0.391 is the mean value of FSI 3 , and 0.07 represents the mobile phone's unconditional impact. For each regression, a positive net impact means that the complementarity hypothesis between mobile phone and FSI 3  in promoting sustainable development index is validated, whereas a negative net impact indicates that the tested hypothesis 3 is rejected. It is apparent from Table 13  that the net impact on the sustainable development index from the interplays between internet use and the financial sector development index 3 is positive, indicating that increasing mobile phone leads them to attract more financial sector development (depth, efficiency, inclusion, and stability) in low-income SSA countries, which, in turn, encourages sustainable development index. On the other hand, net effects from the interaction between internet use and the indexes of financial sector development on the sustainable development index are computed to measure the global effect of this interaction. Since financial sector development 3 is significant, we computed the net effects only for it. Table 13 's sixth column demonstrates that a 1% rise in FSI 3  boosts the sustainable development index by 0.05% [i.e., (0.002 ×0.391) + (0.049)] at the average value of internet use. In this computation, 0.002 is the conditional impact of the interaction between internet use and FSI 3 , 0.391 represents the mean value of FSI 3 , and 0.049 indicates the unconditional impact of internet use. For each regression, a positive net impact means that the complementarity hypothesis between internet use and financial sector development 3 in promoting sustainable development index is validated, whereas a negative net impact indicates that the tested hypothesis is rejected. A positive net impact means Internet use complements financial sector development 3 to increase the sustainable development index. It is clear from Table 13  that the net effects from the interplays between Internet use and the index of financial sector development 3 on sustainable development are positive, indicating that increasing Internet use significantly raises financial sector development (depth and stability) in low-income SSA countries, which, in turn, encourages sustainable development. Finally, regarding the control variables, financial sector development is positively influenced by the growth of GDP, FDI, R, and RL. In contrast, TO shows a negative impact on sustainable development.   5 Conclusions and implications This study seeks to extend the previous literature on achieving the SDGs by demonstrating how ICT supports financial sector development for achieving sustainable development in this region at both aggregate and disaggregate levels. Specifically, using data from 48 SSA countries, we investigate the joint effects of ICT (mobile phone and internet use) and eight financial sector development indicators on achieving economic and social sustainability in light of the 17 SDGs. We find three main results using the system GMM method: (i) the four dimensions of financial development and both indicators of ICT increase economic, social, and environmental sustainability, (ii) increasing the access to mobile phones and the use of internet contributes to the development of the financial sector, (iii) the contribution of financial sector development on the achievement of the SDGs increases with the presence of ICT. Overall, we show that ICT diffusion strengthens financial sector development for achieving the 17 SDGs in SSA countries. In addition to these contributions and findings, this study provides some policy and practical implications. Our findings show the significance of ICT in the process of reaching SDGs. For this reason, more ICT diffusion is required to ensure financial systems in SSA, hence realizing SDGs. In this direction, the World Bank (2016)  has argued that digital adoption is not fruitful unless countries pursue “analog complements.” However, the internet and mobile phone depend largely on their users’ skills, levels, and quality of education. As a result, policymakers in SSA should modernize educational institutions by lowering the cost of the internet and mobile phones, for example, to enhance ICT education among young people (Adeleye and Eboagu, 2019; Hasbi and Dubus, 2020 ). Learning in the technical, scientific, and technological fields may guide and structure the students to better use technologies. SSA countries need to give more importance to ICT development through subsidies and supplies for IT manufacturers or by strengthening the necessary infrastructure to develop this sector. To expand the volume of credit, the weight of banking assets, and the size of African financial markets, technology must be deployed in the financial services sector. Significant investments must be made in the construction of bank branches and the proliferation of automated teller machines, which may promote the efficiency of the financial system, thereby improving economic productivity, social welfare, and environmental quality. Hence, financial resources should be allocated efficiently to encourage green technology innovation projects and friendly technologies, despite their expensive costs for a better future. Finally, SSA countries should also consider the role of the institutional environment in promoting ICT, as a well-developed legal system and property rights tend to encourage risk-taking and innovative behavior, and any strategy in this regard can support sustainable development. Thus, a good political connection can enhance a local government's ability to motivate companies to innovate for sustainability (Wu et al., 2022 ). Despite these recommendations and findings, our research still suffers from certain limitations that must be considered. Firstly, we employed mobile phones and internet use as ICT proxies due to data constraints. However, the tremendous acceleration of the ICT revolution has produced many new technologies, such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, social media, 5 G, Artificial Intelligence, and electronic commerce (Vu et al., 2020 ). Thus, considering these new forms is worthwhile in this field, particularly their effects on the three dimensions of sustainable development. Secondly, we only conducted our analysis based on the data of SSA countries and their distribution according to their low and middle-income levels, without highlighting the heterogeneity in sustainability. Future research should look into the role of financial sector growth and ICT in achieving the SDGs, considering the diversity of SSA countries' sustainability. Finally, the interaction term in our model pushes the effect of ICT on sustainable development to monotonically increase (or decrease) with the financial sector development level. Yet, the effectiveness of ICT in financial sector development may require a certain level to affect sustainable development. Therefore, future studies can apply a regression model based on the concept of threshold levels to identify the existence of contingency impacts.
