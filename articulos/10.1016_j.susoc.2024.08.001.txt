                  This study is an exhaustive investigation into the role of additive manufacturing in achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). Due to its compatibility with intricate structures, additive manufacturing is widely utilised in a variety of industry sectors. This paper intends to examine the various opportunities and significance of additive manufacturing for the advancement of the SDGs. In addition, a number of engineering materials referred to as metals and alloys, ceramics, polymers, and composites are the subject of extensive research to enhance the role of additive manufacturing in the attainment of SDGs. This study demonstrates that sustainable development via additive manufacturing can be achieved through the route of: (a) circular economy, (b) life cycle assessment, (c) environmental aspects, and (d) recycled materials. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analysis (PRISMA) framework is utilized to perform a systematic literature review. Despite the fact that the research demonstrates a clear improvement in waste reduction, environmental friendliness, and energy consumption reduction, it cannot be denied that significant progress remains to be made in these areas.

This study is an exhaustive investigation into the role of additive manufacturing in achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). Due to its compatibility with intricate structures, additive manufacturing is widely utilised in a variety of industry sectors. This paper intends to examine the various opportunities and significance of additive manufacturing for the advancement of the SDGs. In addition, a number of engineering materials referred to as metals and alloys, ceramics, polymers, and composites are the subject of extensive research to enhance the role of additive manufacturing in the attainment of SDGs. This study demonstrates that sustainable development via additive manufacturing can be achieved through the route of: (a) circular economy, (b) life cycle assessment, (c) environmental aspects, and (d) recycled materials. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analysis (PRISMA) framework is utilized to perform a systematic literature review. Despite the fact that the research demonstrates a clear improvement in waste reduction, environmental friendliness, and energy consumption reduction, it cannot be denied that significant progress remains to be made in these areas.   Keywords Additive manufacturing  Sustainability  Environmental aspects  Circular economy  Life Cycle Assessment  Recycling    1 Introduction Sustainable development (SD) is a doctrine for achieving contemporary human development goals alongside economic development without compromising environmental quality for future facets [1 ,2 ]. However, since the beginning of the industrial revolution, energy consumption, material utilisation, and recycling have been recurring obstacles in the implementation of this organising doctrine. The sustainable development goals (SDGs) are the blueprint to attain an improved and sustainable future for all. In 2015, the United Nations (UN) approved a set of eighteen global objectives known as the Sustainable Development objectives. The SDGs acknowledge that economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability must all be integrated for sustainable development [3 ]. Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, was invented by Charles "Chuck" Hull in 1983 using stereolithography method. It is a transformative approach to industrial production that creates three-dimensional objects through precise layer-by-layer depositions [4 ]. It can produce low-cost, complex 3D parts at a reduced lead time for product manufacturing [5 ]. It has changed the traditional way of making things, which is called subtractive manufacturing, and has become an important part of industry 4.0 [6 ,7 ]. In the fourth stage of industrialization, this technology creates a new way for mass and batch production of a wide range of products to be customised [8 ]. As shown in Fig. 1  , Additive Manufacturing is primarily divided into three categories: liquid bed, solid bed, and powder bed. These three categories are further subdivided into seven technologies: Vat polymerization, Binder Jetting, Directed Energy Deposition, Material Extrusion, Powder Bed Fusion, and Material Jetting Sheet Lamination. Moreover, these forms encompassed all types of complexity, material characteristics, and object intricacy [9 ,10 ]. This method of 3D printing produces complex shapes from a variety of materials, including metals and non-metals, alloys, polymers, composites, and ceramics [11 ,12 ]. These new technologies covered almost every aspect of engineering in the aerospace, defence, marine, medical sector, and sport sector [13 ,14 ]. Despite the numerous advantages and diversity of AM, it is critical to consider sustainability through 3D printing [16,17 ]. AM contributes to sustainability by allowing maximum material utilisation, which results in lower operational costs, energy conservation, resource conservation, and waste reduction [18,19 ]. For this, circular economy (CE), life cycle assessment (LCA), environment aspects of manufacturing, and recycling of materials are just a few of the critical factors that are getting more attention than traditional manufacturing approach [20–22 ]. AM contributes in reducing environmental impact through waste reduction or energy efficiency by achieving several SDGs i.e., Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG-7), Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG-12), Climate Action (SDG-13), and Life on Land (SDG-15). Meanwhile, recycling of materials covers (SDG-7, Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG-8), Industry Innovation and Infrastructure (SDG-9), Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG-11), SDG-12, SDG-13, Life Below Water (SDG-14)). Furthermore, circular economy and life cycle assessment impact on (SDG-7, SDG-8, SDG-9, SDG-11, SDG-12, SDG-13, SDG-15). As mentioned above, this new AM approach assists to attain the circular economy, life cycle assessment, environmental aspects, recycling of materials. These four factors significantly cover SDG-7, SDG-8, SDG-9, SDG-11, SDG-12, SDG-13, SDG-14, SDG-15 through the route of AM. The circular economy and life cycle assessment are highly associated with the SDGs viz. responsible consumption and production, decent work and economic growth, industry, innovation, and infrastructure, climate action [23 ,24 ]. In addition, several of the SDGs are directly or indirectly related to environmental concerns since they focus on the need of preserving natural resources and minimising human impact on the environment [25,26 ]. The affordable and clean energy, responsible consumption and production, life below water, and life on land are the highly associated SDGs with the environmental aspects [27,28 ]. Lastly, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, industry, innovation, and infrastructure, climate action, life below water and on land are significant SDGs linked with recycling of materials [29–31 ]. Over the past decade, significant advancements have been made in understanding how additive manufacturing contributes to sustainability. However, research has been somewhat fragmented, with limited focus on the cumulative potential of different AM approaches in achieving SDGs. This study aims to provide a comprehensive review of four key routes-circular economy, life cycle assessment, material recycling, and environmental aspects-highlighting how AM supports sustainability and guiding future research. The specific research questions (RQs) are as follows: The focus of this research is to explore additive manufacturing in order toRQ 1:   Exploring different routes to achieve the SDGs in the framework of AM?  RQ 2:   What are the different engineering materials and their manufacturing approach and environment assessment in regards to AM?  RQ 3:   What are the existing research gaps and future scope to achieve sustainability through AM?    The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2  presents the review approach used in this study. Section 3  gives the findings. Section 4  discusses the findings. Section 5  concludes this paper (Fig. 2  ).  2 Review approach PRISMA framework is used to perform a systematic literature review (SLR) [32 ]. The SLRs follow concise approach to identify the scattering and synthesize apprehension on a specific concern [33 ,34 ]. The relevant articles were collected from the Scopus database using a set of keywords as ‘additive manufacturing’ and ‘sustainable development’ or ‘circular economy’ or ‘life cycle assessment’ or ‘recycled materials’ or ‘environmental’ published between the years 2012 to 2022 as shown in Fig. 2 . The keyword search resulted in 1353 articles including research article, conference paper, review article, conference review, book chapter, and book as shown in Table 1  . As shown in Table 1 , the initial search for sustainable additive manufacturing yielded a total of 1353 documents. In addition, the role of circular economy in achieving sustainability through AM is depicted in the least number of 102 publications and 781 of which were categorised as environmental aspects and AM. In addition, 255 and 225 documents, respectively, pertain to recycled materials and life cycle assessment. These keywords are investigated in this article in terms of how the AM enables them to achieve sustainability. In Fig. 3  , PRISMA flow diagram for the review process showed the identification, screening, and including parameters for the literature review.  3 Findings 3.1 Circular economy The CE reduces the global challenges of waste, environmental degradation, biodiversity catastrophe. As depicted in Fig. 4  , the seven 'R's of the circular economy include reuse, recycling, remanufacturing, rethinking, and repurposing. These R's ensure the long-term viability of additive manufacturing from the perspective of sustainability [35 ]. Despeisse et al. [36 ] studied the six potential areas, i.e., design, information flow, entrepreneurship, supply chain, education, and business model, to allow the circular economy concept with 3D printing. Nascimento et al. [37 ] investigated that obstacle to the changeover of circular economy onward with additive manufacturing. Moreover, developed a business model platform to recycle electronic waste or scrap integrated with additive manufacturing and reverse logistics. Matsumoto et al. [38 ] showed that remanufacturing is one of the potential aspects for the circular economy and additive manufacturing is the tool for remanufacturing to achieve this concept. Several studies in this review concentrated on the various engineering materials and manufacturing approaches that contribute to the circular economy. Voet et al. [39 ] proposed renewable materials, i.e., biobased acrylate photopolymer resins for additive manufacturing to transition respecting circular economy. The biobased ranges from 34 to 67 % through stereolithography printing approach helped for the new sustainable products. Leino et al. [40 ] introduce how additive manufacturing, precisely direct energy deposition, helped the circular economy through repair, remanufacturing, and regeneracy. Van et al. [41 ] showed that different materials, i.e., metals, composites, ceramics, polymers, living cells, can be obtained in the 3-dimensional shape through AM. Moreover, using biomaterials for AM realize a step towards the circular economy. Fig. 5   shows the recent publication trend related to sustainability of AM through circular economy. Saboori et al. [42 ] proposed a widely used AM called direct energy deposition (DED) that is suitable for the circular economy in the automotive and aerospace industries. Furthermore, when compared to conventional tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding, DED approach of AM is far superior in terms of heat affect zone, repair quality, and metallurgical bonding. It was concluded that DED has significant aspects for repair and remanufacture in order to achieve sustainability through a circular economy. Fig. 6   depicts the layout of the circular economy. The different additive manufacturing approaches for sustainable goals with circular economy are showed in Table 2  . Several researchers proposed a new design planning with AM to attain the circular economy. Giurco et al. [43 ] define CE as a new approach to manufacturing, consumption, and its application based solely on the circular flows of several resources, with a focus on the two trends of mineral supply chain and additive manufacturing. Navarro et al. [44 ] developed a method solely for reducing CO2  emissions and motivated the transition to CE from the traditional economy approach. AM contributes to CE by reinforcing multiple product life spans. Sauerwein et al. [75 ] used an interview approach to gather information from additive manufacturing designers. Furthermore, AM collared through a new circular design approach to improve product life span and repair issues. Turner et al. [76 ] created a business approach for redistributed manufacturing (RdM) based on an Icam definition for functioning model (IDEF) to implement in the customer industry via additive manufacturing as part of the circular production integration. The model's main advantage in the domains of transportation, involvement, customer involvement, and circularity is the improvement in customer involvement and reduction in transportation. Rahito et al. [45 ] reviewed the metal additive manufacturing approaches of cold spray, powder bed fusion, and direct energy deposition for product remanufacturing (restoration and repairing). Sauerwein et al. [75 ] discussed the improved approach of using locally available recycled materials (mussel shell waste) for additive manufacturing to provide a focal point for the circular economy. Romani et al. [77 ] compared end-of-life glass fibre reinforced composites to virgin glass fibre reinforced composites and investigated a significant improvement in mechanical properties of the end of life reinforced composites. Cruz et al. [78 ] employed the novel concept of distributed recycling via AM (DRAM), which employs thermoplastic recycled material in the AM process chain. Furthermore, various stages, such as recovery, compounding, preparation, printing, feedstock, and quality, help DRAM to sustain a circular economy. Depalma et al. [46 ] compared the AM printing approaches of selective laser sintering and fused deposition melting for plastic waste. Rashid et al. [79 ] comprehensively studied the circular economy model for AM of recycled materials based on the previous studies. This study includes several polymers and their applications, challenges in recycling methods, and a circular economy route for AM. Giglio et al. [80 ] examined that circular design approach with the route of AM. It has been evaluated that adoption of biopolymers in building design provided better strength and improve the project in terms of benefits i.e., energy savings, lead time, and cost savings at all life cycle stages. Chowdhury et al. [81 ] integrated the circular economy with AM. Furthermore, it has been elucidated the compliance to attain the SDGs in order to ease the pathway toward promoting sustainable development through the route of AM. This literature review revealed that several researchers investigated various domains, such as materials, new AM technology, metallic and plastic waste, and so on, in order to achieve the new economic concept known as CE. However, obstacle in incorporating additive manufacturing (AM) into a circular economy for sustainable development is the limited access to recyclable materials suitable for AM processes. Another one is the energy-intensive aspect of certain AM techniques, potentially offsetting environmental gains if not handled effectively. Moreover, the need for specialized skills and infrastructure with AM technologies creates barriers to widespread adoption in specific areas. Maintaining consistent quality and performance of recycled materials in AM processes remains a technical challenge. Lastly, establishing efficient collection and recycling systems for end-of-life AM products is crucial for a fully circular approach.  3.2 Life cycle assessment LCA is a comprehensive approach that assesses the environmental impact of a product and quantifies the impact of each component on the environment. Fig. 7   depict the life cycle assessment flow chart. The different additive manufacturing approaches for sustainable goals with life cycle assessment are showed in Table 2 . The in-depth assessment of raw materials extraction to end-of-life integrates climate change, ecosystem change, human health, and conventional sources (renewable sources) to assist decision-makers in reducing deteriorating aspects of the product's various components [82 ]. Fig. 8   shows the trend in LCA publications between 2011 and 2022. Saade et al. [83 ] studied that LCA played a significant role in assisting the optimal manufacturing approach. Meanwhile, contribution analysis has been studied between production processes vs. materials contribution in the life cycle global warming potential loads of systems manufactured with AM and conventional machining. Ma et al. [84 ] created an LCA model to assess the long-term viability of additive manufactured products (AMP). The investigation intends to concentrate on AMP design, usage, and product end of life (EOL). Using the LCA methodology, Rodrguez-Alloza et al. [85 ] concentrated on warm mix asphalt's impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, this warm mixed asphalt (WMA) method produced notable results in terms of energy conservation and greenhouse gas emissions. Faludi et al. [86 ] compare AM machines (Fused deposition modelling and Connex 350 polyjet) to a conventional computer-operated milling machine (Haas VF0 CNC) using life cycle analysis. Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene is used as the functional unit for life cycle assessment. The AM approach of fused deposition modelling was found superior in all aspects, including machine utilisation and environmental impacts; however, polyjet and CNC milling are similar in some parameters. Huang et al. [87 ] studied that the net changes in life-cycle primary energy and greenhouse gas emissions associated with AM technologies for lightweight metallic aircraft components by the year of 2050, to enhance on the environmental benefits by shifting from conventional manufacturing to AM processes in the United States aircraft industry. In addition, AM as an energy-saving method in lightweight AM components in aircraft by integrating various factors such as life cycle data, fleet stock, and fuel consumption. It is predicted that a significant amount of energy will be saved in the range of 70 to 173 million GJ per year by 2050. Tang et al. [88 ] laid the groundwork for the most significant environmental estimation model known as life cycle assessment of computer numerical control machine and binder jetting (BJ). The BJ reduced energy consumption and CO2 emissions while serving as a focal point for sustainable development. Paris et al. [89 ] proposed the LCA method for assessing the environmental impact of subtractive manufacturing (milling machines) and additive manufacturing (electron beam melting). The Electron beam melting approach of AM is extremely useful for the production of complex shapes and is more environmentally friendly than subtractive manufacturing. Agust-Juan et al. [90 ] used LCA approach to introduce the concept of digital fabrication (DF) and its environmental impact. The DF is a new construction methodology that saves materials and reduces environmental degradation when compared to traditional construction methods. Through the use of LCA methodology, Böckin et al. [91 ] examined the impact of the powder bed fusion (PBF) approach of additive manufacturing (AM) and conventional manufacturing technology on the metallic parts in the light truck engine. The PBF has been found to lessen environmental deterioration by redesigning a number of lightweight truck engine components. Bours et al. [92 ] studied about the environmental implications and potentially hazardous waste of the AM material. Green Screen and other hazard techniques identify and evaluate hazards all across the manufacturing and printing processes. Using LCA, Ingarao et al. [93 ] suggested comparing the effects of selective laser sintering (SLM), machining, and forming on aluminium alloys. Their goal is to provide the best method for producing aluminium components that benefits the environment. The findings revealed that SLM offers greater advantages in complex shapes, issues with transportation systems, and weight reduction. Li et al. [94 ] investigated the energy consumption and environmental aspects of natural fiber-reinforced composites (NFRC). The LCA methodology for plant-based natural fibre manufacturing via AM was designed for the automobile industry. Bekker et al. [95 ] developed an LCA methodology for stainless steel 308I that included wire and arc AM (WAAM), sand casting, and CNC milling. WAAM and sand casting have similar environmental impacts, according to the ReCiPe LCA approach. Landi et al. [96 ] investigated one of the most distinctive methods of additive manufacturing, laser additive manufacturing (LAM), which has grown in popularity in the metal-processing industry and offers a variety of opportunities for making customised components or lightweight structures. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) technique investigated the sustainability of laser-engineered net shaping by comparing it to CNC machining (LENS). However, in terms of material utilisation, WAAM and CNC milling are roughly equivalent. They concluded that using wire and arc additive manufacturing reduced the significant problem of SS308I known as material waste. Life cycle assessment through materials, such as polymers, metals, and alloys, and various techniques, as opposed to the conventional approach of AM, has been studied in this literature article. It has been discovered that environmental and ecosystem waste is reduced in this new approach to 3D printing via the LCA route. Jones et al. [97 ] studied the LCA of tall concrete wind turbine towers comparing AM to conventional manufacturing. Furthermore, LCA reveals that the 3D printed concrete tower manufactured with nominal strength concrete has lower global warming potential while the steel tower and the 3D casted tower have similar global warming potential. Kumar et al. [98 ] investigated the LCA of conventional machining and cold spray additive manufacturing (CSAM) of aluminum alloy. LCA should be conducted to evaluate the economic benefits and energy utilization of CSAM technology over other CM processes. Erdmann et al. [99 ] evaluated LCA of traditional and additive Remanufactured Electric Bicycle Motors. Moreover, the traditional approach of electric bicycle motors has a higher climate warming potential as compared with AMed and provides sufficient environmental savings. Concisely, several challenges and limitations facing LCA in sustainable development through AM include the intricate task of accurately modelling AM processes in LCAs, leading to uncertainties in assessing environmental impacts. Additionally, LCAs struggle with the dynamic nature of AM technologies and their rapid changes, affecting long-term sustainability evaluations. Integrating social and economic factors into AM-LCAs presents another challenge, as these elements are vital for comprehensive sustainability assessments but can be challenging to measure accurately.  3.3 Environmental aspects Additive manufacturing is one of the prominent manufacturing approaches capable of producing a wide range of metallic, composites, ceramics, and polymer products. When compared to the traditional production processes, AM is by far superior. Moreover, the material and energy consumption are decreased by the approach of AM. Fig. 9   showed environmental impact through publication trends from 2012 to 2022. The different additive manufacturing approaches for sustainable goals with circular environmental aspects are showed in Table 2 . It has been found that several polymers and metals helped improve the environmental issue by reducing the scrap waste of the industries. Meteyer et al. [100 ] proposed a material reduction approach to decreasing the environmental impact using the binding jet process. Wojtyła et al. [101 ] studied the mass production or commercialization of low-cost desktop printers using polylactic acid (PLA), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), nylon, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The ABS is found highly toxic than PLA meanwhile, approximately 30 % of a volatile organic compound from styrene has been noticed from ABS. Deng et al. [102 ] studied the emissions of ABS and PLA particles from the filaments of 3D printers under loading to unloading, including heating and printing steps. The PLA filament is found more significant to ABS either in the case of low surface roughness or temperature variation. Byrley et al. [103 ] investigated that ABS and PLA particles released from the filament are in the size of 100 nm and cause inhalation of this fine particle by the operator of 3DP and causes high risk of severe health issues. Generally, PLA is extracted from a renewable source called corn and has good mechanical properties, is cheaper, and provides the better ability to reduce greenhouse gases [104 ]. Furthermore, ABS is thermoplastic or petrochemical obtained by polymerizing acrylonitrile and styrene in the medium of butadiene, which is highly used in electronic and automobile parts due to its good mechanical and chemical properties [105 ]. Zontek et al. [106 ] proposed that due to the rise in the market of low-cost desktop with 3D printing, the risk of health degradation is a prominent issue during manufacturing due to the lack of ventilation and inadequate safety control guidelines. The assessment of these issues helped in the deep understanding of the emissions of high concentrations of ultrafine particles (UFP) and its results in several cardiovascular diseases. Yi et al. [107 ] investigated the elements that influence PLA particle emissions in a 3D laser printer. It has been determined that the operator's safety is provided by proper ventilation (directly or indirectly) and maintaining the appropriate standoff. Mami et al. [108 ] investigated the idea of green manufacturing by using environmentally friendly design in the aviation industry. The AM is far superior to various conventional approaches in terms of its positive effects on the environment and decreased financial burden. Balubaid et al. [109 ] studied AM as a route of sustainability under analysis by its enablers. This study significantly contributed to an insight understanding of AM and adoption in the manufacturing sector and benefits environmental perspectives. The environmental challenges and limitations in sustainable development through AM involve the high energy consumption of certain AM processes, leading to increased carbon emissions and environmental harm. Disposing and recycling waste materials from AM, particularly hazardous and electronic waste, is another obstacle for healthy environment. Additionally, efficiently managing water and energy usage in AM operations to reduce environmental impact remains a significant challenge. Ensuring significant management steps for AM products and components is equally essential for sustainable development.  3.4 Recycled materials Due to the limitations of engineering materials, a tremendous amount of utilisation has driven the concept of recycling materials in recent times. However, millions of tonnes of waste are discarded in the environment each year. As a result, there is a massive burden on industries and the earth's ecosystem. The different additive manufacturing approaches for sustainable goals with recycled materials are showed in Table 2 . Various technologies and approaches have emerged to recycle waste materials in order to reduce overall strain in manufacturing units [110–112 ]. Fig. 10   depicted the trend in the publication of recycled materials from 2012 to 2022. Recycling plastic materials to be used as raw materials for new items has recently become very important to AM in order to achieve sustainability. Several polymers are used in the commercial and industrial sectors. Hundreds of researchers are studying the PLA among these materials to determine its recyclability [113 ,114 ]. AM is one of the effective approaches that use waste materials and recycled them to produce new products. Several AM approaches i.e., binder jetting, direct energy deposition (cold gas dynamics spray), powder bed fusion (direct laser metal melting, direct laser metal sintering, and selective laser melting), and direct energy deposition are recently used. Zander et al. [115 ] studied waste materials using polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles for the fused filament fabrication (FFF) approach of AM. Reused PET, showed approximately similar tensile strength as commercial (COTS) pellets. Meanwhile, for the sustainable approach, recycling has the potential of green manufacturing and reducing the overall burden on the economy. Mohammed et al. [116 ] demonstrated the prospective of AM for 100 % recycled waste of ABS for the filament formation under two-loop manufacturing. Either one or two-loop concepts both have lower tensile and compressive strengths in contrast to the base material. On the contrary, the two-loop approach showed enhanced properties as compared to single ones. Reich et al. [117 ] studied that recycled polycarbonate 3D printed with open-source Gigabot X gave higher tensile strength than commercial filament printed on desktop. Furthermore, 3D parts are for high-temperature applications along with better heat resistant properties. Medina et al. [118 ] studied that recycled rubber should be used as a reinforcing agent or binder that associates several usages in the construction sector. It has been concluded by analyzing the properties of rubber helped in manufacturing several composites for industrial and construction purposes. Singh et al. [119 ] investigated the thermal and mechanical testing of recycled ABS, PLA, and polystyrene. It is found that young's modulus is high in the case of ABS however, lowest for PLA. Meanwhile, PLA has the most significant peak load compared to polystyrene that has the lowest value. The AM method offers a wide range of material utility that is beneficial for industrial applications. Recycling of metals and alloys, such as aluminium, copper, magnesium, stainless steel, titanium, nickel, and their alloys, is investigated in the bibliographic study [120 ]; Al [121 ,122 ]. Furthermore, several studies on engineering materials have been conducted to aid in the achievement of sustainability [123 ,124 ]. Harooni et al. [125 ] proposed and investigated the mechanical properties and microstructure behaviour of recycled earth metals. Maamoun et al. [126 ] investigated the use of fresh and recycled AlSi10Mg powder in sample preparation AM approach viz. selective laser melting (SLM). It has been discovered that both new and recycled materials exhibit nearly same crystal size and phase compositions; this is an alternative approach to SLM part forming. Mogas-Soldevila et al. [127 ] investigated how AM can be used to regenerate biodegradable composites, such as natural hydrogels. They concluded that fabricated parts are stabilised and dissolve in water in less than a minute. Composite materials are widely used in the current fourth industrial revolution because of their low weight, long life, and high strength, among other benefits. Due to their numerous advantages, composite materials are currently replacing traditional materials in the selection process. Rusu et al. [128 ] investigated recycled PET composites with AM approach. The compressive strength revealed low values for recycled PET however, its compressive strength increased. Romani et al. (2023) explored the AM approach to recycled glass and carbon fibers in the automobile field. Moreover, AM approach implemented for customizable components for the batches near 100 automotive vehicles. The recycled materials faced several challenges and limitations in sustainable development through additive manufacturing (AM) include variations in material properties due to recycling processes, impacting product quality and performance. Furthermore, limited and inconsistent availability of recycled materials suitable for AM, which hinders growth potential and widespread use. Ensuring compliance with regulations and quality standards for recycled AM materials is also difficult but crucial for maintaining reliable manufacturing. Efficient collection and recycling systems for AM materials are essential for effectively supporting a circular economy model.   4 Discussion on findings This research indicates that life cycle analysis, circular economy, environmental concerns, and recycled materials can all be used to accomplish sustainable development through additive manufacturing. Furthermore, several research showed different paths to accomplish the sustainable development objectives within the framework of AM. In addition, various functional materials, manufacturing approaches, and environment aspects in relation to AM have been studied. Several studies showed materials i.e., metals or polymers that can be recycled several times for a healthy environment, ecology, and circular economy. Despite the research clearly illustrating and addressing various SDGs including accessible and renewable energy, quality employment and financial progress, technological advancements and infrastructure development, resilient urban areas and societies, accountable resource use and manufacturing, climate initiatives, aquatic ecosystem preservation, and terrestrial biodiversity conservation—through diverse approaches within the context of AM, it remains evident that substantial efforts are still required in minimizing waste, enhancing eco-compatibility, and curtailing energy usage. 4.1 Exploring different routes to achieve the SDGs in objective-1 Precisely, first objective of this literature review is to explore several paths to accomplish the SDGs through the route of AM. Moreover, different routes i.e., circular economy, life cycle assessment, recycled material, environmental aspects have been reviewed in detail to achieve sustainable development goals. Meanwhile, these paths conveyed optimal direction to achieve the first objective of this research. This comprehensive literature review uncovers various interlinked ways in which AM supports the achievement of SDGs. A prominent approach is the circular economy, where AM technologies facilitate more efficient use of materials, minimize waste, and prolong product lifespans. Furthermore, employing LCA highlight the potential environmental advantages of AM processes, particularly in reducing material waste and enabling more sustainable product designs. Incorporating recycled materials in AM further enhances sustainability, though issues with material quality and consistency remain. The environmental implications of AM, including energy use and emissions, offer both opportunities and challenges that require thorough examination. The review finds that AM most significantly impacts SDGs related to sustainable consumption and production, industrial innovation, and climate action. However, the efficacy of these approaches varies based on specific applications and contexts. Implementing AM for sustainable development faces obstacles such as technological limitations, material constraints, and the need for standardized practices. Future studies should aim to address these challenges and explore how emerging AM technologies can further contribute to SDGs. The findings emphasize the importance of inter-disciplinary approaches, integrating AM with other sustainable technologies and practices to maximize its impact on SDGs achievement. Moreover, the global context is crucial, as AM's potential impact on sustainable development differs across regions and economic settings. In conclusion, while AM shows considerable promise in advancing sustainable development, fully realizing its potential requires addressing current limitations and carefully considering the broader implications of its implementation.  4.2 Engineering materials and environment assessment in objective-2 Effectively meeting the second research objective, several engineering materials i.e., aluminium, copper, steels, PLA, PET, and ABS etc. which have been recycled and significantly used as feed stock materials in several AM techniques are studied. Consequently, reduces the scrap and waste of the industries and in turn minimize the burden on the industries as well as ecosystem. Each material offers distinct advantages in AM applications, with metals providing durability and electrical properties for industrial use, while polymers offer flexibility in design for various consumer products. The recyclability of these materials varies, with some, like PLA, being more easily reprocessed than others. Studies have demonstrated that incorporating recycled materials in AM can significantly decrease environmental footprints compared to using virgin materials, though the extent of this benefit is application-specific. From an economic perspective, the use of recycled materials is becoming increasingly viable as recycling technologies improve. Ongoing advancements in material science continue to enhance the quality and performance of recycled materials in AM, addressing previous limitations. This approach aligns with key SDGs, particularly those focused on responsible production and industrial innovation. While challenges persist, such as maintaining consistent quality across recycled material batches, the trend towards sustainable AM practices is expected to accelerate, driven by environmental concerns and technological progress, paving the way for more sustainable manufacturing methods in the future.  4.3 Objective −3 of research gaps and future scope The last research objective of the literature review, determines that additive manufacturing gets over the drawbacks of conventional techniques that prevent developing sustainable characteristics. It has been reviewed that several metal and their alloys, ceramics, composites, and polymers etc., used in AM are being recycled to reduce the environmental burden and improving the circular economy in order to ultimately attain the SDGs. However, recyclability is still needing further research to explore some other aspects using AM techniques. Improving the recyclability of materials used in AM is a critical research area. While various materials are currently being recycled, there's a need to enhance recycling efficiency and maintain material quality through multiple use cycles. This includes developing AM-specific recycling techniques and studying the long-term performance of recycled materials in AM applications. Another aspect requiring further investigation of the energy efficiency of AM processes. While AM can reduce material waste compared to traditional subtractive manufacturing, some AM techniques are energy-intensive. Future research could focus on developing more energy-efficient AM technologies or optimizing existing processes to reduce overall energy consumption.   5 Conclusions In this study, a thorough review of the literature regarding three research questions focussed on the sustainability aspect of additive manufacturing (AM) was conducted. The review explored circular economy, life cycle assessment, environmental aspects of manufacturing, and material recycling approaches. These routes within the AM framework provide a better understanding of how to achieve sustainability. The field of AM has received significant attention with research publications setting new standard over the past decade. This study also highlights the limitations and drawbacks of traditional manufacturing compared to AM. By focusing on 100 % waste or recycled materials as feedstock for AM, this review openes a new window for sustainability. The analysis revealed clear evidence of relationship between AM-related areas and the achievement of long-term sustainability goals. This path helps AM meet the objective of green manufacturing, cleaner production, and overall sustainability. In terms of environmental impact, several researchers have developed an alternate approach to manufacturing via AM that aided environmental and ecosystem prosperity. There has recently been a significant increase in research articles focusing on the potential of AM for sustainable development. It has been determined that AM overcomes the limitations of traditional methods that hinders the achievement of sustainable goals. Metals, composites, and ceramics can be reused with minimal deterioration in their properties. However, when recycled polymers are used as raw material with various additives, it remains unclear how many times they can be recycled without compromising their thermal and mechanical properties. More research is needed to identify materials that can be recycled multiple times while maintaining a healthy environment, ecosystem, and circular economy. The field of novel technology remains open for the development of models and new approaches for the mass production of intrinsic parts with additive manufacturing technology.
