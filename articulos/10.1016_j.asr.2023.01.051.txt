To meet these goals requires essential strategies that build on economic growth and a range of social needs including education, health, social protection, and job opportunities, while addressing issues with climate change and environmental protection. The recent developments on Earth Observation and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies provides a great opportunity to develop indicators and reliable solutions to achieve the outcomes mentioned by SDG’s. New technologies and innovative approaches are highly beneficial for representing and assessing the human environment. As highlighted in the recent SDG report 2020, that for most of the goals less than half of the countries of the world have comparable international data. This special issue is committed to all SDGs mainly Climate Action, Life on Land, Sustainable Cities and Communities focusing on taking urgent action to combat global warming, climate change and their impacts in order to fight against global threats on ecosystems which result in long-term serious socio-economic effects on nature and human life. This Special Issue contains a collection of peer-reviewed contributions that build on the recent advances in deep learning and environmental monitoring-based studies such as building extraction from high-resolution aerial images, glacier monitoring from remote sensing data, multi-seasonal forestry monitoring, sea surface temperature monitoring, precipitation data analysis, agricultural assessment from optical/radar remote sensing data, sea level monitoring in the Antarctic, wildfires and biodiversity measurements. This Special Issue has tremendously benefited from the help, guidance and incredible effort by Dr. Peggy Ann Shea, ASR Co-Editor for Special Issues. I would like to express my gratitude to the authors, who contributed to this Special Issue for sharing their highly valuable scientific results. I would also like to acknowledge the voluntary reviewers, whose professional reviews contributed to the further improvement of the submitted papers.
