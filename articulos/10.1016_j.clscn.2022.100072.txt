                  Warehouse management will be the focus of this article, which aims to examine the benefits and issues & challenges of using Industry 4.0 technologies to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the United Nations (UN). We conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) evaluation of the published literature from credible peer-reviewed journals in the major databases Scopus and Web of Science. The analysis of literature will be a frequency analysis of the literature by considering the year of publications, the contribution of leading journals and publishers, and the methodology adopted and the content analysis of literature to get the benefits, issues & challenges of the implementation of industry 4.0 on warehouses in accordance to SDGs that were identified from the literature. Industry 4.0 research on logistics and supply chain management, as well as warehouse management, showed a significant increase in research papers in the past two years. But, the study on industry 4.0 in warehousing toward SDGs is still in its early stages, with just a few articles contributing to sustainable practices. Our findings from the literature reveal that the major benefits of implementing industry 4.0 in warehouse management as per SDGs are “SDG – 2 (Zero Hunger)”, “SDG – 4 (Quality Education)”, “SDG – 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy)”, “SDG − 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure)”, “SDG – 12 (Ensure Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns)”, and “SDG – 13 (Climate Action)”. Lack of government support, legal issues, lack of skilled manpower, political issues, and old/traditional warehouses are the major issues & challenges of industry 4.0 in warehouses to avert the deed of achieving SDGs in developing countries. This study is one of those that apply industry 4.0 in the context of warehouse management, thus it will reveal insights and implications for future research.

Warehouse management will be the focus of this article, which aims to examine the benefits and issues & challenges of using Industry 4.0 technologies to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the United Nations (UN). We conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) evaluation of the published literature from credible peer-reviewed journals in the major databases Scopus and Web of Science. The analysis of literature will be a frequency analysis of the literature by considering the year of publications, the contribution of leading journals and publishers, and the methodology adopted and the content analysis of literature to get the benefits, issues & challenges of the implementation of industry 4.0 on warehouses in accordance to SDGs that were identified from the literature. Industry 4.0 research on logistics and supply chain management, as well as warehouse management, showed a significant increase in research papers in the past two years. But, the study on industry 4.0 in warehousing toward SDGs is still in its early stages, with just a few articles contributing to sustainable practices. Our findings from the literature reveal that the major benefits of implementing industry 4.0 in warehouse management as per SDGs are “SDG – 2 (Zero Hunger)”, “SDG – 4 (Quality Education)”, “SDG – 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy)”, “SDG − 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure)”, “SDG – 12 (Ensure Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns)”, and “SDG – 13 (Climate Action)”. Lack of government support, legal issues, lack of skilled manpower, political issues, and old/traditional warehouses are the major issues & challenges of industry 4.0 in warehouses to avert the deed of achieving SDGs in developing countries. This study is one of those that apply industry 4.0 in the context of warehouse management, thus it will reveal insights and implications for future research.   Keywords Industry 4.0  Warehouse management  Systematic literature review  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  Issues & challenges  United Nations (UN)    1 Introduction The implications of industry 4.0 technology have transformed the manufacturing industry and created economies of value creation during the past four years (Ching et al., 2022 ). Industry 4.0 has a more positive impact on product innovation in the service sector than in the manufacturing industries in German companies (Sarbu, 2021 ). According to (Calış Duman and Akdemir, 2021 ), the benefits of industry 4.0 in business yield profitability, improvement in sales and production speed, increase in productivity and quality, and efficiency of the firms. There is a dynamism in the production line that makes it easier to integrate industry 4.0 in warehouses and logistics, thanks to the company's increased global competitiveness in IoT, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Augmented Reality (AR), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain Technology, big data, self-driving robots, and additive manufacturing are all part of Industry 4.0′s concept (Beltrami et al., 2021; Kerin and Pham, 2019; Wankhede and Vinodh, 2021 ). This different technology is helped managers in making the right decisions by monitoring the real-time tracking of materials in warehouse management (Carvalho et al., 2018 ). It is essential for the manager while considering the whole complete supply chain, which includes the warehouse, must be able to deliver the proper information about the product's identification, location, and other tracking information at each level of the supply chain (Ganesan et al., 2016 ). The research on the integration of industry 4.0, especially in the field of logistics and Supply Chain Management (SCM) is minimum and it is still in the initial phases of development. Examples include an assessment of published research on the influence of industry 4.0 on sustainability activities and performance (Beltrami et al., 2021 ). A bibliometric and SLR on the categorization of industry 4.0 design principles to determine the factors of digital transformation success has been conducted by (Ghobakhloo et al., 2021 ). (Birkel and Müller, 2021 ) has reviewed on industry 4.0 context contributes to the cleaner supply chain by achieving triple bottom layer i.e., social, economic, and environment. The study on the Internet of Things (IoT) in logistics and supply chain management has been examined by (Abderahman Rejeb et al., 2020 ). The trends, advancements, and gaps in the research in their assessment of the literature on the implementation of industry 4.0 in logistics and supply chain management are reviewed (Abdirad and Krishnan, 2021 ). A synopsis of industry 4.0 on SCM studies is expressed by (Chauhan and Singh, 2020 ). In our context, we explore an SLR on the benefits and issues & challenges of Industry4.0 in warehouse management. Earlier, the systematic literature review on warehouse management is conducted by (Staudt et al., 2015 ) on warehouse performance measurement, (Shah & Khanzode, 2017 ) on warehouse operational issues, (Bartolini et al., 2019 ) on green warehousing, (de Koster et al., 2007 ) on warehouse design for order picking, (Gong and de Koster, 2011 ) on stochastic models and analysis of warehouse operations, (Masae et al., 2020 ) on order picking routing in warehouses, (Custodio and Machado, 2020 ) on flexible automated warehouse management, (Jaghbeer et al., 2020 ) on automated order picking systems on warehouse design and performances, (Melacini et al., 2018 ) on e-fulfillment and distribution in omnichannel retailing, (Boysen et al., 2019 ) on warehousing in the e-commerce era, and (Kumar et al., 2021b ) on revisiting the warehouse research. Table 1   shows the existing reviews on logistics & SCM using industry 4.0 and the evolution of warehouse management. According to (UN, 2016; United Nations, 2015 ), “The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by all United Nations (UN) members in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. The focus is on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by all countries – both developing and developed – in a global partnership. They recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must be closely linked to policies to improve health and education reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests”. Many research works on the integration of SDGs on Logistics and SCM during the COVID-19 pandemic period. (Zimon et al., 2020 ) has outlined the barriers to implementation of SDGs in the SCM, (Cai and Choi, 2020 ) has persuaded 3 SDGs are highly attention towards textile and apparel SCM, (Pohlmann et al., 2020 ) have pointed out the SCM in the Brazilian food poultry is needed guidelines to achieve SDGs, (Centobelli et al., 2020a ) has analyzed the green practices in European Logistics Service Providers (LSPs) to achieve SDGs, (Jouzdani and Govindan, 2021 ) has pointed out 7 SDGs are contributed in the perishable food SCM, (Zarbakhshnia et al., 2022 ) has analyzed the logistics operations based on circular economy to achieve SDGs. The research works on the integration of SDGs on warehouse management is minimum. Hence, this paper aims to examine which SDGs are involved in the implementation of industry 4.0 on warehouse management. For this purpose, we defined SLR on industry 4.0 in the administration of warehouse review as guided by the following research questions:RQ1: In what ways might warehouse management benefit from the deployment of industry 4.0 under SDGs?  RQ2: What are the Issues & challenges of integrating Industry 4.0 and Warehouse Management in the context of SDGs?    To the best of the authors' knowledge, no literature review publications on industry 4.0 in the context of integration of warehouse management and SDGs have been discovered. Thereby, we then conduct an SLR that categorizes and analyses previously published publications from credible peer-reviewed journals in the most popular databases. This justifies leads to the study of the present research work.  2 Methodology of the study SLR always creates the foundation stone for all academic inquiries (Xiao and Watson, 2017 ). It will play an important role in systematically collecting available literature and provides descriptive analysis like journal publications, their trends, and potential to create insight on implementation, barriers, future direction, and the development of existing knowledge base on any topics (Briner and Denyer, 2012; Seuring, 2013 ). Based on industry 4.0 in warehouse management, we conducted the study using SLR to examine our research questions. We follow the steps prescribed by SLR processes which are outlined by (Govindan and Hasanagic, 2018; Mathiyazhagan et al., 2021 ) for this study. The different stages of SLR of industry 4.0 in warehouse management are shown schematically in Fig. 1  . Electronics bibliography databases such as Scopus and WOS were used in the initial phase of this research to gather relevant articles. After reviewing multiple combinations of keywords, Stage 1 as shown in Fig. 1  was found as the most suitable keyword to explore the considered theme. There was a search for these terms in the paper's title, keywords, and abstract using the database's search feature 920 papers were retrieved from the two databases. This keyword search work is done on 7th February 2022 and considered the full paper publication year up to 2021. In the second stage, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to get the most relevant papers according to our review theme is shown as Stage 2 in that Fig. 1 . Based on the language of the paper, the exclusion of duplicates, the inclusion of peer-reviewed journal articles alone, and the inclusion of publications based on the subject in two databases (Scopus and WOS), we obtained 97 papers. In the third step, we assessed whether the complete article focuses on industry 4.0 technologies and one or more areas of warehouse management, and warehouses as the primary factors in logistics and supply chain management were selected for our study. After analyzing the 97 papers, finally, 63 articles were selected for the final study. Fig. 2   displays the literature analysis based on the final 63 articles in the sample. Individual peer-reviewed articles were the focus of the literature analysis following (Denyer and Tranfield, 2009 ), and their core parts were described in terms of their relationship with one another. The review findings are in two steps according to (Tranfield et al., 2003 ), the analysis of literature will be a frequency analysis of the literature by considering the year of publications, the contribution of leading journals and publishers, the methodology adopted and the content analysis of literature to get the benefits, issues & challenges on the implementation of industry 4.0 on warehouses that were identified from the literature.  3 Analysis of literature 3.1 Frequency analysis 3.1.1 Year-wise publications The publication trend of the papers on industry 4.0 in warehouse management is shown in Fig. 3  . The publication period was not restricted but considered up to 2021, the first relevant paper was published in 2008 by (Khojasteh-Ghamari et al., 2008 ) deals with automation in warehouses. But industry 4.0 was first coined by the German in 2011 with the classification of different technology (Rojko, 2017 ). From 2012 to 2016, only 6 papers out of 63 (9.52 % of the sample) during the introduction stage of industry 4.0 in 2011. After 2016, the trend in the publication has started to increase strongly. Especially in 2021, the majority of papers i.e., 26 papers out of 63 (41.26 % of the sample) were published. As a result of COVID-19′s surge in online sales, individuals are taking advantage of the technological advancements, which is likely due to an increased focus on the selection of items available or the storage in the warehouses (Srivatsa Srinivas and Marathe, 2021 ).  3.1.2 Journal-wise publications The distribution of papers by the journal is provided in Table 2  . Industry 4.0 and warehouse management have been extensively covered in academic journals. The International Journal of Production Economics, the International Journal of Production Research, and IEEE Xplore contributed 17 papers (26.98 percent of the sample). The next eight journals produced 16 articles (25.39 % of the sample) each of them published two articles. Most of the papers i.e., 30 articles (47.61 % of the sample) are published with only one article each on industry 4.0 and warehouse management.  3.1.3 Individual publisher-wise publications Table 3   shows the number of articles published according to individual publishers. Elsevier (Science Direct) was on the top list of individual publishers with 13 articles (20.63 % of the sample). Taylor & Francis and Emerald Insight were on the second top list of individual publishers contributing 11 articles each. Next to the top two lists, IEEE Xplore and Springer were on the third and fourth top list of individual publishers contributing 6 and 5 articles respectively.  3.1.4 Nature of the study Table 4   and Fig. 4   show an overview of the different categories of research methodology for industry 4.0 with warehouse management. As evident from Table 3 , over 32 articles (50.79 % of the sample) in our study are related to analytical modeling. The majority of the papers were analyzed by mathematical modeling equation to resolve the challenges faced by industry 4.0 in warehouse management. Next to analytical modeling, empirical/case study research methods were contributed to 23 articles (36.50 % of the sample). Industry 4.0 in warehouses can be sufficiently precise with case study approaches in implementing industry 4.0 in warehouse management. A lesser number of publications were contributed from literature review and Delphi methods.    4 Content analysis 4.1 Benefits of emerging trends in different industries 4.0 in warehouse management The transformation of logistics centers has changed during the emergence of the industry 4.0 era (Yavas and Ozkan-Ozen, 2020 ). Awareness of the negative consequences of industrial activity 4.0 is rapidly being used in logistics operations by both practitioners and academics in engineering and operations management (Nantee and Sureeyatanapas, 2021 ). Using webs, sensors, objects, and appliances in a smart warehouse may be monitored and controlled the warehouse operations (Jabbar et al., 2018 ). Fifth Generation (5G) Internet-based technologies including warehouse robots, IoT, Internet of Services (IoS), and cyber-augmented collaboration will transform the traditional/old warehouse to considerably increase its performance (Dusadeerungsikul et al., 2021 ). The warehouse can benefit from 5G technology resulting in scheduling and vehicle routing (Dolgui and Ivanov, 2021 ). Integrating real-time location systems into warehouse management has the potential to increase safety and efficiency in forklift placement and tracking, as well as order processing in inventory (Halawa et al., 2020 ). An integrated warehouse management system enables order to demand information and customer location makes it easy for shipment of delivery (Lim et al., 2020 ). To keep up with the ever demands of customers and technological advancements, warehouse operations must be adaptable. When it comes to manufacturing, however, the old manual warehouse operation is no longer appropriate (Lee et al., 2018 ). (Zhou et al., 2019 ) emphasized the importance of modern distribution centers utilizing mobile computing technology to store warehouse data for order picking, real-time communication systems, order position in real-time, store relevant data, and gather orders on time, all while lowering operating costs. (Upadhyay et al., 2021 ) has said that the benefits of industry 4.0 in green practices like green procurement, green production can use of natural resources in the best possible manner in logistics - warehouse infrastructure will bring customers together at a single platform and make ease of business by creating a positive image in the form of social responsibilities. Industry 4.0 in warehouse management helps to save direct inventory costs and enhance improvement in integrating with other manufacturing companies in entire supply chains (Barbalho and Dantas, 2021 ). Automation of warehouses (AS/RS) using industry 4.0 might help to reduce cycle times and energy usage, especially in big distribution centers (Yetkin Ekren, 2021 ). IoT, big data analytics, cloud computing, and cyber-physical systems like autonomous warehouse trucks will be critical to a manufacturer's long-term competitive advantage (Gružauskas et al., 2018 ). (Nantee and Sureeyatanapas, 2021 ) have urged the Thai government to support their industry 4.0 policies at the national level, citing the necessity for government assistance. Under the “SDG − 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy)” by the UN, all developing countries must implement the policies on installing solar roof-top in every warehouse's buildings as an alternate energy resource that provides a roadmap for building climate resilience, clean and energy-efficient warehouses to get sustainable and green practices in their respective countries (Centobelli et al., 2020b ). Table 5   shows the benefits of different Industry 4.0 technology in the warehouse. (A Rejeb et al., 2021 ) has said that the emergence of industry 4.0 has transformed advanced computer vision techniques like AR. Product visualization and identification, greater visual control and monitoring of items in inventory, reduction of search time, mis-picks, fatigues, and mistakes are all important advantages of AR in warehouse management. Also, AR has an impact on warehouse management to increase productivity by making it easier for managers to pick and sorting the right goods in the best possible order, identifying and alerting damaged goods when distribution, and providing faster access to data and information (Husár and Knapčíková, 2021 ). The convenience of AR with IoT facilitates a cost-effective order picking system that is scalable and can be used in warehouses of all sizes which helps in reducing the cognitive load on the picker by providing information for each item on the packing list (Nagda et al., 2019 ). Thus, AR implementation in warehouse management reduces the adverse effects of economic activities and positively impacts the reduction of emissions during handling operational activities in the warehouse to obtain “SDG − 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy)”. (Kumar et al., 2021b ) has conducted literature on how warehousing research has changed from a traditional godown to an automated warehouse management system leading to better efficiency and effectiveness. Increasing and continuous production in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) has resulted in an accumulation of work-in-process materials, resources, space congestion, and time loss, resulting in missing pallets and components required for subsequent manufacturing operations. To overcome these issues, the usage of the Quick Response (QR) code in warehouses has benefited the improvement of the high flow of materials in SMEs (Vukićević et al., 2021 ). Connecting online and offline customer services are made easier by the use of QR codes in automated storage sorting. (Chen et al., 2019 ). Under “SDG – 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure)”, the government in developing countries must offer an incentive to SMEs to update QR codes and make necessary in their entire warehouse operations to achieve sustainability. The impact of an automated warehousing system on two warehouse companies is improved their sustainable performance in productivity, air emission, the safety of personnel, and visibility (Nantee and Sureeyatanapas, 2021 ). (Gružauskas et al., 2018 ) has proposed a model on trade-offs between sustainability and cost-effective performances. The result shows that by using autonomous vehicles in warehouses, CO2 emission is reduced by 22 %. Thus, an automated warehouse has improved the environment by reducing emissions and thereby produces clean energy as prescribed by the “SDG − 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy)”. (Zhang et al., 2021 ) has observed that the IoT-enabled tracking system is useful in the warehouse and can significantly reduce the total cost, increase space utilization, and greater visibility. The use of customized middleware to monitor real-time analytics of warehouse activities provides considerable economic benefits, increasing total warehouse efficiency (Arumsari and Aamer, 2021 ). IoT helps in decentralized decision support in warehouses by integrating resources (Stock Keeping Units, pallets, shelves) and streamlining both inbound and outbound activities with more accuracy (Yangke et al., 2021 ). Operational managers in logistics can assess the contribution of IoT in the performance evaluation of sustainability in inventory, warehouse, and order fulfillment aspects (Keivanpour, 2021 ). The ease of IoT can maximize warehouse space, monitor the warehouse environment, and optimize the product management process as business and technology develop. (Song et al., 2021 ). Consumers have the option of picking up their food straight from a distribution center or central warehousing or retail location when they place an online order for it (Oeser et al., 2018 ). (Lin et al., 2019 ) emphasizes the importance of food safety issues that we will take more seriously as they continue to threaten public health. As a result, it is critical to track the safety of food across the whole supply chain, from growers to processor to warehouses to distribution centers to retail. There are several problems in the agro-logistics business that may be addressed using a hybrid model of IoT and cloud computing, including perishable items, supply fluctuations, and stringent food safety and sustainability standards (Verdouw et al., 2018 ). IoT time–temperature indicator (TTI) based cold-chain system is based on international food standards to collect temperature data of food products (Shih and Wang, 2016 ). IoT is useful for perishable goods in cold chain warehouse storage and it alerts when the temperature or humidity of perishable goods is abnormal (Luo et al., 2016 ) also in agro-logistics it allows to replenish the inventory in warehouses; and enables users' insight into the quality of food (Bogataj et al., 2017 ). Improved perishability performance in the food retail industry may be achieved through the combination of IoT, automated inventory control platforms, and AS/RS (Maheshwari et al., 2021 ). Before and following the introduction of IoT in cold chain logistics, (Sun et al., 2020 ) tested a cost-profit model on the preservation rate, product quality, and warehousing and transit costs. As a result, product quality has improved and storage and transportation costs have decreased. Through the use of IoT-enabled monitoring, it is feasible to gather quality metrics and collected information for improving transparency, minimizing the risk of food losses, and regulating the safety of frozen shellfish (Feng et al., 2020 ). These parameters involve product safety aspects such as temperature, humidity, and lighting intensity status (Tsang et al., 2018 ). (Zhao et al., 2021 ) has stressed the importance of safety management in logistics since two recent fatal accidents that happened in cold storage have become more complicated and dangerous. Thus, IoT has controlled the safety aspects (Trab et al., 2017 ). Safety aspects of materials and machinery from theft in the warehouse area are of paramount interest in implementing IoT to monitor the warehouse. If any intruder arrives in the warehouse, the multiple cameras immediately capture the image and send the message through the SMS gateway (Akhil et al., 2019 ). The use of IoT in grocery store operations is focused on security to increase confidence in the business model and attract more consumers (Kaur and Kaur, 2018 ). The rise of the Internet of Things will provide a solution for warehouse and industrial businesses to achieve real-time visibility and information exchange, as well as a level of intelligence (Qiu et al., 2015 ). To minimize total supply chain costs, enhance fill rate, and reduce CO2 emissions, manufacturing facilities and warehouses will leverage the IoT to tackle the issue of location-allocation in a multi-tier supply chain network (Doolun et al., 2018 ). IoT-enabled manufacturing logistics procedures and cost-effective solutions may be developed by using Industrial IoT technology (Qu et al., 2017 ). It is simple to monitor operational and emergency care in public warehouses with the help of the IoT (Y. Zhang et al., 2017 ). Port warehouses are run by multiple organizations, and the privacy of precise product information must be well-maintained. Since, IoT may help to address scalability, fault tolerance, and privacy (Goudarzi et al., 2016 ). IoT infrastructure based on RFID technology enhances the development of decentralized warehouse management to improve the competitiveness of warehouses in a dynamic environment (Reaidy et al., 2015 ). Thus, IoT is an important aspect of industry 4.0 and nearly 84 % of this can be addressed in all SDGs. IoT implementation in warehouse management has the potential on creating sustainable aspects on three bottom layers i.e., economic, social, and environmental (Jouzdani and Govindan, 2021 ). For instance, IoT can reduce economic losses by monitoring inventory items, reducing CO2 emissions through the real-time detection unit, and creating human values by restricting major accidents. In terms of SDGs, IoT can achieve SDG in various goals. They are 1. Implementation of IoT in cold-storage facilities achieves by restricting wastage of foods, monitoring the perishable level of food items, and keeping the frozen level of food items thereby helping in achieving sustainable growth as prescribed in “SDG – 2 (Zero Hunger)”. 2. Implementation of IoT in the industrial warehouse helps in a cost-effective solution, energy-efficient, and healthy lives for workers which enhances the sustainable growth as prescribed in “SDG – 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy)”. 3. Implementation of IoT in warehouse management helps to combat climate changes by controlling the emissions from the warehouse through proper measurement of pollutant emissions thereby it helps in achieving sustainable growth as prescribed in “SDG – 13 (Climate Action)”. 4. Implementation of IoT by the Government in creating multi-modal logistics parks to achieve sustainable growth as prescribed as “SDG − 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure)”. (Khalifa et al., 2021 ) has stressed the importance of AI in warehouse management will benefit improved the data collection and inventory process, maximum revenue growth, and cut down operational expenditures. The use of chatbots in procurement is proven the ultimate benefit to the operators. In the present era of AI in logistics, its benefits are in improving the overall efficiency and service quality of the distribution network (Bu, 2021). (Ellefsen et al., 2019 ) emphasizes the importance of AI in logistics and warehouses for timely delivery, decreasing the damage of products in the warehouses. When it comes to logistics, AI can help discover and resolve problems at several levels. SCM has been substantially improved due to robotic sorting and AI-powered visual inspection (Khalifa et al., 2021 ). The implementation of AI in warehouse management creates an exact number of items available, restricts damage to goods, and reduces raw materials overuse thereby it achieves minimal loss of economics and environmental front to achieve sustainable growth as prescribed in “SDG – 12 (Ensure Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns)”. The increased use of AS/RS driven by embedded computers is created to support the scheduling and picking decisions in the warehouse (Khojasteh-Ghamari et al., 2008 ). The integration of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) and information technology has provided a potential mechanism to enhance material handling in warehouse management to be collision-free and more efficient (Dharmasiri et al., 2020 ). AGV in a warehouse helps to find and detect the pallet structure in an industrial environment that is accurate and suitable for the direction of moving objects (Syu et al., 2017 ). It has been observed that autonomous cars are increasingly being used in the automobile industry's warehouse process, which is advantageous to the flow of materials in the manufacturing line (Tubis and Poturaj, 2021 ). A methodology for creating a warehouse management system that reacts to real-time events to minimize the effect of operational issues on product flow and order fulfillment was created (Binos et al., 2021 ). Using an autonomous robot as a coworker, researchers in the paint industry evaluated the selection process for materials and the decrease in exposure time to raw materials, as well as the process automation and improved process tracking and human safety industry has been performed in a warehouse at paint industries (Rey et al., 2021 ). Maintenance costs, security, material handling, on-time delivery, and sustainability characteristics of AGVs, autonomous trains, and drones are major considerations in logistics and the supply chain (Perussi et al., 2019 ). The induction of AGV in warehouse management generates seamless movement of items through automation and continuous process, prevention of accidents, reduces operational costs, and more importantly reduces the negative impact of environmental aspects thereby it contributing the sustainable growth as prescribed in “SDG – 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy)”. A model has been proposed by (Mishra and Maheshwari, 2021 ) that blockchain technology may be used in the Indian Public Distribution System (PDS) to avoid food grain theft, diversion, and leakage at the central warehouse management. This helps to provide transparency and accountability. Using blockchain technology, warehouse management uses drone-collected inventory data to secure the integrity of the information and make it available to interested parties. (Fernández-Caramés et al., 2019 ). Thus, Blockchain technology in warehouse management provides accountability and transparency from food grain theft and leakage of food grains, and the avoidance of fraudulent smart packaging of food grains. It creates to optimize efficient supply–demand of food grains and enables efficient energy use of renewable resources thereby it achieves the sustainable growth as prescribed in “SDG – 2 (Zero Hunger)”, “SDG – 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy)”, and “SDG – 12 (Ensure Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns)”. Real-world Radio-Frequency-Identification (RFID) object tracking system that maintains track of inventory entering and exiting a warehouse (Cheng et al., 2012 ). RFID in warehouse utilize access control, indoor localization, automation, stocktaking, and automatic inventory models which will help in the identification of the labeled objects (Gareis et al., 2021 ). It would be possible to scan multiple labels at the same time, interrupt broken or wrinkled labels with ease, enhance picking accuracy, and track inventory across various floors of a distribution hub using video and scanning software such as barcode or RFID (Kembro et al., 2017 ). WMS can improve order fill rates and accuracy, increase packaging efficiency, and track inventory with the help of RFID (Lee et al., 2018 ). IoT developments in smart inventory management are made possible by RFID technology, which provides a rapid and low-cost method of counting or positioning objects in the warehouse (Li et al., 2020 ). (Tu et al., 2021 ) suggested a pick-and-pass algorithm that may be translated into a cyber-physical system in warehouse order fulfillment to choose the workload balance between picking lines and emergency replenishment is beneficial in enhancing the efficiency of picking operations. The induction of RFID in the warehouse management provides replenishment of items, a low-cost method of tracking items, and increases packaging efficiency thereby it creates sustainability as prescribed in “SDG – 12 (Ensure Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns)”. For all industry 4.0 technologies, proper education and skills are necessary to the young minds and the workers provided by the government in the Higher Educational Institutes (HEIs) in the developing countries to update enhanced learning emerging technologies like IoT, Blockchain, AI, QR, AGV, and RFID to make sustainable growth for all as prescribed in “SDG – 4 (Quality Education)”.  4.2 Issues & challenges in implementation of industry 4.0 in warehouse management Table 6   shows the various issues and challenges in Industry 4.0 while implementing warehouse management in the context of SDGs. Warehouse 4.0 systems are extremely reliant on the internet devices like IoT, GPS, etc., and the supply of electricity. If any of these devices are not working properly, the interruption will occur in the entire supply chain network which will stop the entire activities and eventually occurred huge financial losses. Therefore, the companies should aware of and prepare strategic planning to avoid those disruptions during uncertain situations. (Nantee and Sureeyatanapas, 2021 ). The application of industry 4.0 in developing countries like India is less due to fragmented warehouses as more warehouses are used a little bit of technology, especially in small and medium-sized warehouses are traditional warehouses, poor customer engagement, and waste management, and not utilizing fully automated operation as the many companies are not much interested in investing the latest technology (Binos et al., 2021 ). The implementation of the tradeoffs model between sustainability and cost-effective performance is not initiated due to major infrastructure and legal issues occurring in many countries (Gružauskas et al., 2018 ). Social factors like human health, movement of employees, and fatigue are not considered of prime importance in many developing countries (Dolgui and Ivanov, 2021 ). There is a lack of awareness about the government's policies for the benefit of human health and the environment in various developing countries (Upadhyay et al., 2021 ). This is due to there being a lack of interest among top management, politics, and legislation in every developing country (Perussi et al., 2019 ). In addition to a lack of government assistance, a lack of vision and goal, and a shortage of experienced labour, small and medium-sized warehouses face further challenges in adopting smart and sustainable supply chain processes (Kumar et al., 2021 ). While implementing Industry 4.0 in warehouses, layoffs, Information & Communication Technology (ICT) competency, tax policy, increasing electricity bills, and maintenance cost are the main problems (Nantee and Sureeyatanapas, 2021 ). In many countries, they are not aware of the latest technology to know how to design large distribution centers to reach maximum benefits (Dusadeerungsikul et al., 2021 ). (Yangke et al., 2021 ) has stressed that the problem will occur in storage allocation, strategy section, and indoor optimizing while implementing IoT in large warehouses. This is due to when the forklift operators, who are often confused and eventually do not fulfill First-In-First-Out (FIFO) practices operating in high frequency and workload resulted in misallocated pallets (Vukićević et al., 2021 ). Complex operation procedures accelerated the operating pace, and the high labor intensity is an important barrier in modern warehousing to keep the perishable goods to be fresh (Zhao et al., 2021 ). It is difficult for RFID testing in small and medium warehouses to obtain fast testing speeds as well as highly accurate results. (Cheng et al., 2012 ). Also, IoT implementation in warehouses possesses a maximum investment in starting stage but while considering the long-term plans, the entire operations will be more profitable (Sun et al., 2020 ). The initial investment makes a challenge for many warehouse industries. The main important issue from the safety aspects of workers is the usage of Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) in the warehouse has been harmful to the human eye in the form of smart glasses. Safety precautions are needed as there is limited research on the negative impact of smart glasses (Herzog et al., 2018 ). The issues & challenges faced by the implementation of industry 4.0 on warehouse management in its initial stage in many developing countries. The government and the industrial consultant need to prepare proper guidelines to resolve the issues faced by the industries in their respective countries to achieve SDGs by 2035.   5 Managerial and practical implications In the last two years, the research in industry 4.0 on logistics and supply chain management, and warehouse management saw tremendous growth in terms of research articles. According to (Chauhan and Singh, 2020 ) the firm’s reputation depends on industry 4.0 where the main priority towards data security and confidentiality. But, still, industry 4.0 in the context of warehouse management lacks in defined structure since most of the studies are deals with manufacturing and cold chain logistics. There is a depth of knowledge studies on mathematical/ analytical modeling research studies that can provide major benefits, issues & challenges of industry 4.0 in warehouse management but lack empirical results. Many countries throughout the globe are starting on a journey to accomplish the UN SDGs which aim to provide a better and more sustainable future for all nations (Voola et al., 2022 ). Developing countries like the Saudi Arabian government, Indian government, Australian government, etc. are working on environmental legislation towards sustainability to ensure the organizations are committed to International Standard Organization (ISO) practices to minimize air pollution and clean energy. The COVID – 19 crisis has the potential to drive SDG growth in all areas, making it better prepared to combat future epidemics. (Kumar et al., 2021a ). According to (Upadhyay et al., 2021 ), the importation of consumer products in Saudi Arabia results in greater transportation and warehousing expenses than in other countries. This is because these commodities are not produced in the area. When these commodities are manufactured locally, CO2 emissions are significantly reduced, enhancing the circular economy. Similarly, the Indian government has taken measures like AatmaNirbhar Bharat Abhiyan to promote local goods globally by manufacturing local goods as global standards and stored in a warehouse thereby it will reduce warehousing and transportation costs and achieving SDGs by reducing CO2 emissions. While the International Solar Alliance (ISA) promotes ''bringing together a collection of states to endorse renewable energy, sustainable environment, public transit and climate,''(Ghosh and Chawla, 2021 ). With this measure, India and associated countries will be built warehouse buildings used as renewable energy like solar installation on the rooftop to minimize the cost of electricity and cleaner logistics and supply chain. Warehouse management strategies that combine industry 4.0 practices will provide a more environmentally friendly logistics and supply chain across the globe. Only a few papers have been published on sustainable objectives by integrating industry 4.0 with warehousing, logistics, and SCM (Nantee and Sureeyatanapas, 2021 ), (Gružauskas et al., 2018 ), (Kumar et al., 2021b ). There are very few studies looking at the effects of industry 4.0. The majority of these studies concentrate on warehouse management's operational, security, and safety aspects. Further research on empirical data might explore to know the real status of quality, performance measurement, and major improvements. Our review of the literature will assist warehouse managers in better understanding the benefits, issues & challenges of industry 4.0 in warehouse management to achieve SDGs. Management and academics may utilize this review to jump-start their warehousing, production, and research insights into industry 4.0. To attain the SDGs for cleaner logistics and supply chains, both scholars and managers must regard sustainability as a string of opportunities in the form of industry 4.0.  6 Conclusions and limitations of the study A few studies have focused on the impact of industry 4.0 in warehouse management by achieving overall efficiency, security, safety aspects of products, and reducing overall costs. Establishing industry 4.0 in warehouses remains elusive. The present study comprehensively analyzed the benefits, issues & challenges of industry 4.0 in warehouse studies on achieving SDGs by adopting SLR-based research and providing the variables for future research to further development in this field. Our SLR of 64 articles reveals that operational efficiency, monitoring and tracking of the product, safety aspects of the product, and personnel are the key variables for the benefits of industry 4.0 in warehouses. Lack of government support, legal issues, lack of skilled manpower, political issues, and old/traditional warehouses are the major issues & challenges of industry 4.0 in warehouses management to prevent the success of achieving SDGs. From the literature analysis, the major benefits of implementing industry 4.0 in warehouse management as per SDGs are “SDG – 2 (Zero Hunger)”, “SDG – 4 (Quality Education)”, “SDG – 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy)”, “SDG − 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure)”, “SDG – 12 (Ensure Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns)”, and “SDG – 13 (Climate Action)”. This study contributes to the warehouse, logistics, and supply chain management sector by giving insights into the benefits, issues & challenges of industry 4.0 in warehouse management in a variety of technical areas. This study has some limitations that must be considered. Title, Abstract, and Keyword searches in the world's most prestigious scientific databases, Scopus and Web of Science, supported the whole review. A second limitation is that the selection of articles for review is considered as English as the language, only peer-reviewed articles, and publication is up to 2021. Other sources of relevant articles such as book parts, chapters, conference proceedings, Ph. D. theses, and non-English language publications were not considered. In the future, additional insights may be taken from other scientific databases like EBSCO, PROQUEST, and google scholar for further analysis. Despite these limitations, we feel our analysis is comprehensive and helps the progress of industry 4.0 in warehouse management technology.
