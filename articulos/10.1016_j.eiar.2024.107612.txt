                  As emphasized by the challenging sustainable development agenda, countries are facing a complicated combination of environmental stress and social challenges, leading the Earth system towards an unsustainable path. Therefore, it is crucial to accurately assess past fluctuations contributing to current situations and apprehend plausible future implications. This study integrates safe and just operating space (SJOS) with Sustainable Development Goals to depict multiple “windows” of environmental and social evolution in different historical periods, with 31 provinces in China as a case study. Then, we track the spatiotemporal evolution trajectory of environmental performance and social well-being in each province from 2012 to 2021. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is utilized to capture the temporal relationships between various indicators and to forecast the spatial trends of SJOS in the provinces from 2022 to 2030. Research findings indicate that: (1) over the 2012–2021 period, the environmental performance of the majority of provinces far exceeds the warning thresholds, with no province falling within all threshold boundaries simultaneously. The phosphorus cycle is the most challenging boundary, with only 6.8% of provinces within the safe boundary over the past 10 years. In comparison, freshwater use performs the best, with 80% of provinces staying within the threshold. (2) Social well-being generally improves across all provinces from 2012 to 2021, but the spatial and temporal trajectories are more varied. All provinces meet the thresholds for the food security and employment indicators. However, none of the provinces meet the standard for the social equity indicator. (3) Over the 2022–2030 projection period, environmental performance and social well-being trend in opposite directions across provinces. This culminates in no province being entirely within the safe and just space by 2030. Sanitation shows the most significant change compared to other indicators. Xinjiang had the largest improvement at 59.12%, while Tianjin had the most significant downward trend at 53.88%. Adjustments in national policies and priorities are essential if China wants to accomplish the sufficiency of biophysical resources whilst ensuring social equity in the access and exploitation of these resources.

As emphasized by the challenging sustainable development agenda, countries are facing a complicated combination of environmental stress and social challenges, leading the Earth system towards an unsustainable path. Therefore, it is crucial to accurately assess past fluctuations contributing to current situations and apprehend plausible future implications. This study integrates safe and just operating space (SJOS) with Sustainable Development Goals to depict multiple “windows” of environmental and social evolution in different historical periods, with 31 provinces in China as a case study. Then, we track the spatiotemporal evolution trajectory of environmental performance and social well-being in each province from 2012 to 2021. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is utilized to capture the temporal relationships between various indicators and to forecast the spatial trends of SJOS in the provinces from 2022 to 2030. Research findings indicate that: (1) over the 2012–2021 period, the environmental performance of the majority of provinces far exceeds the warning thresholds, with no province falling within all threshold boundaries simultaneously. The phosphorus cycle is the most challenging boundary, with only 6.8% of provinces within the safe boundary over the past 10 years. In comparison, freshwater use performs the best, with 80% of provinces staying within the threshold. (2) Social well-being generally improves across all provinces from 2012 to 2021, but the spatial and temporal trajectories are more varied. All provinces meet the thresholds for the food security and employment indicators. However, none of the provinces meet the standard for the social equity indicator. (3) Over the 2022–2030 projection period, environmental performance and social well-being trend in opposite directions across provinces. This culminates in no province being entirely within the safe and just space by 2030. Sanitation shows the most significant change compared to other indicators. Xinjiang had the largest improvement at 59.12%, while Tianjin had the most significant downward trend at 53.88%. Adjustments in national policies and priorities are essential if China wants to accomplish the sufficiency of biophysical resources whilst ensuring social equity in the access and exploitation of these resources.

Certain critical thresholds in resource utilization and environmental degradation are being approached or even transgressed (Steffen et al., 2015a ; Abdollahzadeh et al., 2021 ; Sakariyahu et al., 2024 ). There are looming signs that the Earth System is moving towards an unsustainable trajectory (Fang and Liu, 2024 ). A new paradigm is therefore urgently needed to assess current risks and pressures on the Earth system and to apprehend plausible future consequences. The transition towards sustainability is desperately needed and a pivotal challenge (Han et al., 2023 ). Given the immense pressure on resources and the environment, it is pivotal to accurately assess whether human activities fall within the carrying capacity of natural ecosystems. Academics have extensively researched this issue and proposed various concepts, including limit to growth (Durand et al., 2024 ), safe minimum standard (Gomez-Jaramillo et al., 2024 ), carrying capacity (Shen et al., 2022 ), ecological footprint (Syrovátka, 2024 ), tolerable window (Bruckner et al., 2003 ), and the precautionary principle (Villagómez-Márquez et al., 2023 ). However, controversies over the measurability of carrying capacity have prevented breakthroughs in theoretical and methodological advances, prompting a shift in attention to adaptation (Parry et al., 2009 ). Against this backdrop, Planetary Boundary (PB) framework emerged as one of the most iconic achievements for quantifying the carrying capacity of global resources and environment, which sparking great academic interest and discussions (Heffernan, 2009 ; Downing et al., 2019 ). However, scholars pointed out that focusing only on environmental protection may lead to neglect of extreme poverty and other social injustices (Raworth, 2012 ; Jiang et al., 2024 ). Therefore, Raworth (2012)  reframed PB framework as safe and just operating space (SJOS) by adding 11 social dimensions of the “social foundation”. Recently, there have been progress and breakthroughs of SJOS framework in assessing sustainability (Hossain and Ifejika Speranza, 2020 ; Han et al., 2023 ). Some scholars also point out that since social policies are mainly formulated based on the regional scale by national or sub-local governments, global-scale assessments cannot serve as an effective indication of environmental policies in different countries and regions. Therefore, in order to improve the effectiveness of the SJOS framework in environmental management services, it is necessary to perform a scale transformation, matching the boundaries from the global scale to the regional scale where these decision-making and management are implemented (Dearing et al., 2014 ; Cole et al., 2017 ; Raworth, 2017 ; Han et al., 2023 ). Although the above research demonstrated the meaningfulness of the SJOS framework at a global sub-scale while maintaining its original design, it is primarily based on the analysis of short-term, relatively static indicators. Social-ecological systems are complex and dynamic systems, so scientifically describing the long-term dynamic changes of ecosystems is crucial for predicting future trends and key state transitions (Huang et al., 2024 ), thereby laying the foundation for ecosystem-based environmental restoration and sustainable development management (Wang et al., 2024 ). To the best of our knowledge, provincial-scale SJOS has not been widely practiced, and few studies predict future SJOS, let alone by the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. Therefore, there is a pressing need for further investigation to address these gaps in the existing literature. To address the knowledge gaps, this study examines the 31 provinces in China to address the following questions: Is it possible to maintain a secure ecological environment alongside socio-economic development? If not, is it possible in the future to achieve human well-being while keeping the negative ecological impact on the planet within acceptable limits? To answer these two questions, this paper (1) integrated the SJOS and SDGs frameworks, with five environmental performance and ten social well-being indicators and thresholds selected to emphasize environmental risks and unacceptable social deprivation; (2) drew the spatiotemporal evolutionary windows of ecological degradation and social progress and tracks their trajectories in three regions by identifying and quantifying environmental ceilings and social foundations in China's provinces; (3) innovatively utilized the LSTM model to forecast the environmental and social indicators, further clarifying whether each province will be within SJOS by 2030 and whether the 2030 Agenda  can be achieved. The contributions are as follows: (1) environmental performance and social well-being in China's 31 provinces are revealed on the basis of the latest statistical data; (2) the difference of two dimensions is discussed to offer valuable guidance for the transition to sustainability; (3) detailed analysis of whether China's provinces will be within SJOS by 2030 are discussed.  2 Methodology 2.1 Study area This study applies the SJOS framework to sustainability assessment, with a focus on China, a key player in global sustainable development. The value of choosing China as the study area lies in the following: (1) China has undergone over 30 years of sustainable development practices (Han et al., 2023 ). This has provided abundant data and illustrative case for the empirical testing and application of the SJOS framework, enhancing its ability to better serve the localization implementation of SDGs. (2) China exhibits significant spatial heterogeneity in resources, environment, and social inequality (Wen et al., 2022 ). Additionally, as one of the world's largest economies, China wields significant global influence (Chen et al., 2023 ). Exploring the application of the SJOS framework in complex and diverse countries is important not only for China itself, but also for other developing countries and emerging economies around the globe. (3) Its history of socio-economic development at the expense of environmental degradation, creating a conflict between economic growth and ecosystem management (Bryan et al., 2018 ). Therefore, studying China is beneficial for gaining insight into the strategies required to achieve sustainable development in the context of significant environmental challenges.  2.2 Research framework The framework of SJOS emphasizes both environmental security and socio-economic development, providing a visual tool for achieving sustainable development. SJOS combines two concentric radar charts to depict the two boundaries-ecological and social (Fig.1  ). The outer boundary is an environmental ceiling, which representing thresholds for key biophysical processes of the planet. Exceeding these thresholds may potentially result in negative or even catastrophic impacts. The inner boundary is social foundation, representing the expectations for achieving human well-being, reflecting the minimum standards for societal development. In other words, surpassing environmental ceiling could lead to ecological destruction, while failing to meet the minimum standards of social foundations could jeopardize the healthy development of human societies. If the country or region wants to achieve sustainable development, social systems must operate within SJOS. Furthermore, while Transforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development  (United Nations, 2015 ) does not straightforwardly mention PB, it already covers all nine systemic processes of PB. Some of these processes are the focus of a goal (water, land use, climate change, and biodiversity), while others are included in particular targets (ocean acidification, air quality, biogeochemical cycles, ozone depletion, and chemical pollution). It can be argued that the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) incorporate the notion of a biophysically safe operating space into the wider framework of sustainable development (Häyhä et al., 2016 ). Therefore, referring to Han et al. (2023) , this study integrates the concept of SJOS and SDGs to examine regional sustainability.  2.3 Environmental ceiling and environmental performance Defining stringent global, national, and local environmental boundaries is a significant challenge (Cruz et al., 2009 ; Jo, 2011 ). Numerous methods of allocating emissions budgets have been proposed, including equal individual rights (per capita approach), historical rights (i.e. grandfather rights), historical responsibility (i.e. calculating cumulative emissions), and sufficiency (i.e. ensuring a decent standard of living) (Cruz et al., 2009 ). However, these allocations have yet to be agreed upon due to the ethical complexities surrounding allocation (Xia et al., 2023 ). Our study adopted a top-down approach that allocated the share of each PB among countries according to their present populations. This selection was decided by the specific question: What quality of life could be widely achieved if resources were evenly allocated? Allocating planetary boundaries to countries based on per capita equivalence could normalize resource endowments and reconcile comparative advantages between resource-rich and resource-limited countries (Fang et al., 2015 ). Furthermore, compared to the global scale, the SJOS framework at the regional scale needed to consider the variability of indicators for different key environmental-ecological processes more thoroughly (Cole et al., 2014 ; Dearing et al., 2014 ). In this research, four PBs (climate change, biogeochemical flows, freshwater use, and land system change) were downscaled to per capita equivalents, reference to Dao et al. (2015)  and Algunaibet et al. (2019) . Considering biogeochemical flows included two PBs (nitrogen and phosphorus cycles), five indicators were selected in environmental dimension (Table 1  ). The selection of these indicators was based on the subsequent reasons: (1) they covered the major components of the Earth system (atmosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere, biosphere, and cryosphere) and their interrelated processes (carbon, water and nutrient cycles) (Nakicenovic et al., 2016 ); (2) they had implications for policy-relevant timelines; (3) they faced threats from human activities; and (4) they might influence the stability of the Earth system and global future development (Rockström et al., 2023 ). 2.3.1 Climate change The PB for climate change has been set as a maximum of 350 ppm of atmospheric CO2  concentration, or 1 W per m2  of energy imbalance at top of atmosphere (Steffen et al., 2015b ). Since there was strong scientific evidence for the link between CO2  emissions and atmospheric CO2  concentrations (Steffen et al., 2015c ), annual CO2  emissions were chosen as the control variable in this study to assess this threshold. The global warming target could be translated into per capita emissions.  2.3.2 Freshwater use The original PB for freshwater use considered that a critical threshold would typically be exceeded if >40% of the basin's renewable water resources were withdrawn (Rockström et al., 2009 ). To downscale this PB, freshwater use was chosen as the control variable. The safe amount of freshwater that humans can consume globally is 4000 km3 , which is equivalent to 40% of total global renewable water resources (Han et al., 2023 ). The per capita boundary was calculated by dividing this PB by the world population.  2.3.3 Land-system change The PB for land-system change is defined as a maximum of 15% of the ice-free land used for cropland. Based on this threshold, the proportion of anthropogenic land to ice-free land area was selected as the control variable. The surface of anthropized land considered in this study covered agricultural land and urbanized land.  2.3.4 Biogeochemical flows Biogeochemical flows were measured by two indicators: phosphorus and nitrogen cycle. The PB for phosphorus cycle was 6.2 Tg/year phosphorus mined and applied to erodible (agricultural) soils (Steffen et al., 2015a ). Agricultural phosphorus fertilizer application was chosen as a control variable. The nitrogen cycle's initial PB was 62 Tg/year, which contained anticipated biological and chemical nitrogen fixation (Steffen et al., 2015b ). According to Algunaibet et al. (2019) , the nitrogen cycle's PB was reduced from 62 to 39.7 Tg/year. Agricultural nitrogen fertilizer application was chosen as a control variable. To evaluate biogeochemical flow, we divided them by the global population to obtain a standardized annual boundary.  2.3.5 Other planetary boundaries Biosphere integrity was not included in the analysis because of the difficulty in measuring and downscaling diversity (Han et al., 2023 ).Ocean acidification is mainly driven by climate change. If the climate change boundary of 350 ppm CO2  concentration is respected, the ocean acidification boundary would not be exceeded (Steffen et al., 2015b ). Since climate change indicator was fully considered in the analysis, ocean acidification was not included as a separate boundary. It is uncertain about how the stratospheric ozone depletion boundary was developed. In addition, as the minimum O3  concentration stabilized for about 15 years and the ozone hole was repaired after the phase-out of ozone-depleting substances (Han et al., 2023 ), this PB is not included in our research. Two of nine PBs have yet been quantified, i.e., novel entities and atmospheric aerosol loading boundaries.   2.4 Social foundation and human well-being Based on the targets of the SDGs of the UN and China's national conditions, 10 indicators of social foundations were selected to measure human well-being (Table 2  ). 2.4.1 Food security Regarding Han et al. (2023) , achieving universal access to food is a challenge for at least 5% of the population. Therefore, the threshold was set at 95%. The study selected the proportion of children under 5 with severe malnutrition as the food security indicator.  2.4.2 Income To estimate performance relative to this social well-being, we use the share of people living on the minimum subsistence level as an income indicator. According to O'Neill et al. (2018) , the threshold was set at 95%. It was assumed that values above 95% indicate the eradication of extreme poverty.  2.4.3 Water The choice of urban water penetration as the indicator was based on data availability. A threshold value of 95% was selected due to the challenge of extending the penetration rate to the remaining 5% of the population (Han et al., 2023 ).  2.4.4 Sanitation The indicator used in our study was sanitary toilet density. As per the Urban Sanitation Facilities Planning Standard  (GB/T 50337–2018), the recommended installation density of urban public toilets is 3 to 5 seats per square kilometer of planned construction land. We assumed that 3 represented 60%, 5 represented 100%, and 60% was the threshold.  2.4.5 Health care Due to the limitation of data availability, we measured health care in China by using the healthcare management rate of children under 7 in each province. Similar to the other indicators, a threshold of 95% was selected.  2.4.6 Energy The indicator was selected as urban gas penetration. Similar to the other indicators, a threshold value of 95% was used.  2.4.7 Education Due to the availability of multi-scale data, the literacy rate of the population aged 15 and over was selected as the indicator. A threshold value of 95% was set, considering the difficulty of providing universal education to at least 5% of the population (Han et al., 2023 ).  2.4.8 Gender equality The Transformed Gender Parity Index (TGPI) proposed by UNESCO is used as an indicator of gender equality. It is calculated by dividing the gross enrollment rate of females by that of males when there are fewer females than males in education, and by dividing the gross enrollment rate of males by that of females when there are fewer males than females. Thus, TGPI is presented from a gender equality perspective, and is an important indicator that directly responds to equal access to education for both genders. A threshold value of 1 was chosen for this indicator.  2.4.9 Social equity The Gini coefficient was selected as a measurement indicator (Fang et al., 2021 ). The threshold for the Gini coefficient was set at 0.3, referring to O'Neill et al. (2018) . To maintain the convention that higher values of the social indicator represented better performance, the threshold was set to one minus the Gini coefficient, which was 0.7.  2.4.10 Jobs Jobs were measured by one minus the unemployment rate. According to O'Neill et al. (2018) , the threshold for this indicator was set at 94%.   2.5 LSTM model Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) represents a progression from Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Unlike traditional neural networks, RNN excels in handling sequential data, showcasing a complexity that surpasses that of Artificial Neural Network (ANN). RNN was first researched in the 1980s by Rumelhart et al. (1986) . The final output of RNN depends not only on the current input but also on the information contributed by previous moments (Zhao et al., 2017 ). LSTM, while structurally similar to RNN, incorporates memory units to its architecture to mitigate the issue of vanishing gradients, thus adding to its complexity. LSTM was designed to process time-series data, and found successful applications across various fields such as environment, public health, and finance (Cao et al., 2019 ; Shahid et al., 2020 ; Wei et al., 2021 ; Yan et al., 2021 ; Zhang and Li, 2022 ). Given their proven track record, this paper selected the LSTM model, a classical algorithm within the realm of sequential neural networks, to capture the interconnections between different temporal sequences of environmental and social indicators. The aim was to forecast the trends of SJOS in each province by 2030. Fig. 2   illustrates the four key components of LSTM: cell state, forget gate, input gate and output gate. The cell state retains important information from each time step. The forget gate removes unrelated information from the previous time step. The input gate chooses related information from the cell state of the previous time step. The output gate selects the information to be output to the cell state in the next time step. The following equation can describe the flow of LSTM.(1) i t  = ∂ W xi  x t  + W ui  h t − 1   + b i       (2) C ∼  t  = tanh W xc  x t  + W uc  h t − 1   + b c       (3) o t  = ∂ W xo  x t  + W uo  h t − 1   + b o       (4) f t  = ∂ W xf  x t  + W uf  h t − 1   + b f       (5) C t  = f t  · C t − 1   + i t  · C ∼  t     (6) h t  = o t  · tanh C t      f t   ，i t   ，o t    represent the forget gate, input gate, and output gate at time t, respectively. x t   ，h t   ，C ∼  t   ，C t    represent input values, output values, update gates, and the final cell state. ∂  ，tanh   represent the activation functions. W  ，b   represent the weight matrix and error.  2.6 Data source See Table 3  .   3 Result 3.1 Environment performance and social well-being To clearly outline the temporal and spatial evolution of ecological degradation and social progress in China's provinces, the spatio-temporal evolutionary trajectories of environmental performance and social well-being from 2012 to 2021 were characterized (Fig. 3   and Fig. 4  ). The results indicated significant spatial difference across provinces. 3.1.1 Environment performance The ratio of actual environmental indicators to environmental thresholds could be used to measure environmental performance. Fig. 3  shows that in most provinces of China, per capita resource use levels greatly exceed environmental limits. The phosphorus cycle presented one of the most challenging boundaries, with 6.8% of provinces exceeding the average per capita boundary over the 10 years. Furthermore, the majority of provinces had surpassed the ceilings of the nitrogen cycle, climate change, and land system cycle. The ratios of provinces within the boundaries are 11.6%, 17%, and 19.4%, respectively. In contrast, freshwater utilization was better, with 80% of provinces remaining within the ceiling. It was noteworthy that no province operates within all biophysical boundaries simultaneously. All provinces had shown an upward trend in climate change over time. By 2019, 30 provinces (excluding Tibet due to lack of data) exceeded the ceiling. In terms of freshwater use, the number of provinces exceeding the boundary increased from 7 in 2012 to 9 in 2021. Regarding land system change, Inner Mongolia, Tibet, Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang were all below the boundary over the 10-year period. However, Fujian and Sichuan started to exceed the boundary in 2017. The phosphorus cycle exhibited an overall decreasing trend, with Beijing and Shanghai remaining below the boundary and Zhejiang falling below it in 2021. Similarly, the nitrogen cycle also showed an overall downward trend, with six provinces falling below the boundary. Overall, environmental performance varied significantly across indicators, depending on the type of environmental indicator, such as resource-based indicators (e.g. freshwater use, land system change) and pollution-based indicators (e.g. climate change, biogeochemical flows). This indicated the need for tailored policies for each type of indicator, considering their unique characteristics and importance.  3.1.2 Social well-being The results for the spatial pattern of social well-being were quite complex (Fig. 4 ). China's provinces performed well overall in food security and jobs, with all provinces meeting the thresholds (except Tibet, which did not meet the standards in 2012). Provinces performed better in water, education, energy and income, with an average of >50% meeting the threshold. The percentage of provinces that met the baseline for sanitation, health care, and gender equality was 35.2%, 26.8%, and 13.9%, respectively. However, no province met the threshold for social equity. In terms of changes in social well-being over time, China's provinces generally improved their social foundations and developed in all areas between 2012 and 2021. The majority of provinces experienced an increase in income and health care, with the number of provinces meeting the income threshold rising from 13 to 23, and those meeting the health care threshold increasing from 7 to 12. Additionally, the compliance rate in water exceeded 90% in 2017 and reached 100% in 2021. In terms of sanitation, many provinces made significant progress due to the “Toilet Revolution” action plan from 2018 to 2020  launched by the National Tourism Administration. The number of provinces meeting the threshold increased to more than half by 2021. Additionally, provinces showed an upward trend in energy, increasing from 12 to 25 provinces meeting the threshold. Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai had achieved 100% coverage since 2012, and Zhejiang had achieved 100% coverage since 2018. In 2021, 25 provinces met the education threshold, while Anhui, Guizhou, Tibet, Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia did not meet the threshold during the study period. Inner Mongolia had shown the best performance in gender equality, consistently meeting the threshold since 2014.   3.2 Trends in changes After examining the spatial distribution of environmental performance and social well-being, we proceeded to examine the temporal evolution from 2012 to 2021. To emphasize regional differences, we divided the 31 provinces into three regions: eastern (12 provinces), central (9 provinces), and western (10 provinces) region (Wang and Zhang, 2022 ). 3.2.1 Trends in environmental performance The analysis indicated notable variations in the number of provinces adhering to the boundary, ranging from 0 to 4 (see Fig. 5  ). Overall, environmental pressures had increased over time, resulting in a decline in environmental performance away from the SJOS. The eastern region had the best environmental performance, while the central region had the worst. Jiangsu in the eastern region, Jiangxi in the central region, and Ningxia in the western region all exceeded five PBs. Specifically, in the eastern region, only Tianjin saw an increase in the number of boundaries respected, while the numbers in Hebei, Liaoning, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Shandong remained unchanged, with the rest of the provinces experiencing a decrease. No provinces in the central region showed an increase. In the western region, Qinghai showed an increase in the number of boundaries respected. It was worth noting that the decrease in environmental performance was mainly concentrated in the central provinces of China, with a decrease of 6.  3.2.2 Trends in social well-being Notably, no province achieved all 10 social thresholds (see Fig. 6  ). The number of social foundations achieved in each province ranged from 2 to 9. Overall, there was an upward trend in social well-being across provinces over time. The eastern region had the highest social well-being, averaging 7.25 completions per province by 2021. The central region had a medium level of social well-being, with an average of 6.56 completions per province. The western region had the lowest social well-being, with an average of 5.6 completions per province. Among the three regions, only Qinghai in the western region maintained the same number of completions, while the remaining 30 provinces saw an increase. Jiangsu in the eastern region performed the best, achieving 9 thresholds. Provinces that achieved 8 thresholds include Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Fujian, and Guangdong in the east, Henan in the center, and Shaanxi in the west.   3.3 Prediction results 3.3.1 Robustness test We use RMSE to test the robustness of the LSTM model. The results are shown in Fig. 7  . Occasionally, a few provinces have RMSE values above 1 (4.09%), mainly due to the high variance of the raw data. However, overall, the robustness is in a manageable range.  3.3.2 Changing trends of sustainable development performance Based on the prediction results of the LSTM model, we compared the sustainable development performance of each province in 2030 with that of 2021 to analyze their changing trends (Fig. 8  ). The results indicated an overall improvement in environmental performance across provinces, while social well-being showed a declining trend. Specifically, regarding climate change, Gansu showed the most significant increase at 65.87%, whereas Qinghai exhibited the largest decrease at 97.14%. Regarding freshwater use, Tianjin had the most significant decrease at 67.02%, while Guangdong showed the largest increase at 29.16%. In terms of land system changes, Shanghai experienced the most significant decrease at 50.07%, whereas Zhejiang showed the highest increase at 33.20%. Tibet and Qinghai were the provinces with the highest increases in phosphorus and nitrogen cycle, respectively, with Hebei performing exceptionally well in both dimensions. In terms of social dimensions, the provinces with the most significant changes in food security and energy were consistent. Heilongjiang showed the highest increase, while Guizhou experienced the most significant decrease. Hainan showed the best performance in water, gender equality, and social equity, with increases of 1.69%, 0.47%, and 19.72% respectively. In terms of water, Tianjin, Hebei and Shanghai had all reached 100% completion during the research period. Hence, no changes were recorded. Similarly, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Zhejiang had shown the same situation in terms of energy. Notably, Hunan was particularly interesting, with the most significant upward trends in health care and jobs, while experiencing the most significant declines in income and gender equality. Compared to other indicators, sanitation was the most variable and diverse indicator, with Xinjiang showing the highest increase at 59.12% and Tianjin the highest decrease at 53.88%. In education, Tianjin showed the highest increase at 1.69%, while Ningxia experienced the most significant decrease at 4.48%.  3.3.3 Provincial SJOS in 2030 The SDGs established by the UN in Transforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development  are set to be achieved by 2030. Therefore, we aimed to investigate further whether Chinese provinces could achieve sustainable development in SJOS by 2030. Using the natural breaks method, we divided the number of underperforming indicators in each province into 4 groups (Fig. 9  ). According to the forecasted data, the best-performing provinces were Beijing and Shanghai, with only 3 indicators falling short. The worst-performing group of provinces included Guangxi, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Gansu, and Ningxia. It was evident that, overall, provinces in the eastern region exhibited better performance, while those in the western region showed poorer performance. Overall, the performance regarding climate change was poor, with only Guangxi, Hainan, Sichuan, Qinghai, and Xinjiang meeting the safety boundary, while the other provinces exceeded the threshold (Tibet did not have data for this indicator). In terms of social equity, only Tianjin and Hainan met the threshold, with the rest of the provinces falling short in this indicator. It was worth noting that Jiangsu, Heilongjiang, Jiangxi, Hunan and Ningxia surpassed all environmental performance boundaries. Provinces with poor social performance included Sichuan, Guizhou, Tibet, Gansu (with 7 indicators failing to meet the thresholds), Henan, Guangxi, Yunnan and Qinghai (with 6 indicators failing to meet the thresholds).    4 Discussion China, the world's most populous country, accounted for approximately 17.90% of the world's population and 7.23% of its land area in 2021. Additionally, it contributed 28.06% of global CO2  emissions and 14.59% of global freshwater consumption in 2020, as well as 83.4% of fertilizer consumption in 2020 (World Bank, 2023 ). China is considered a major contributor to global pressures on the PBs and it is closely linked to other countries that have significant global impacts. Therefore, China is an appropriate subject. 4.1 The interaction between environmental performance and social well-being indicators The relationship between economic development and the environment, or among environmental factors, may be linear, parabolic non-linear, threshold non-linear or hysteretic non-linear (Schreckenberg et al., 2018 ). A multitude of environmental earth system processes that exceed thresholds have the potential to jeopardize other system processes (Raworth, 2012 ). The SJOS framework elucidates the intricacies of the interactions that exist between the various system elements. Socio-economic and environmental dimensions are inextricably linked. They can directly and indirectly compliment the implementation of SDGs by strengthening synergies and creating cascading effects (Su et al., 2023 ). Nevertheless, there are also negative trade-offs among some environmental and social indicators. For instance, increases in per capita GDP may contribute to chemical pollution in the land and other problems (Su et al., 2023 ). Consequently, the absence of management safeguards may result in a situation where increased social well-being will jeopardize ecological security (Opoku, 2019 ).  4.2 Policy recommendations The complex relationship between multiple environmental factors and the level of social welfare achievement within the SJOS framework indicates that besides continuously improving the socio-economic development level and meeting people's daily needs, it is imperative to decelerate the environmental system processes that exceed environmental limits and promptly reverse the trend of environmental degradation, such as climate change and biogeochemical flows in the region. Given the intricate interconnections among the elements within the SJOS, it is crucial to consider whether a particular process will inhibit the development of other processes in pursuit of maximizing social foundations and ensuring ecological safety. For instance, the approaches taken to eradicate poverty should avoid exerting pressure on the development of the ecological environment. In order to achieve high-quality socio-economic development within the limited environmental boundaries, regions should focus on both controlling resource-environmental scales (such as minimizing the increase in carbon emissions, reducing the application of agricultural nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers, and strict controlling of freshwater usage), and upgrading resource-environmental efficiencies (mainly referring to the efficiency of utilization, in order to alleviate the degree of dependence of socio-economic development on the resource-environment). Finally, a systematic guarantee system should be constructed to ensure the effective optimization of environmental sustainability and the orderly allocation of environmental elements.  4.3 Limitations Undeniably, the study has limitations. There is a missing of required data during the study's indicators collection (e.g. CO2  emission data in Tibet), which may challenge indicator selection and constrain subsequent analysis. Another limitation is related to the inherent uncertainties in the SJOS framework and downscaling methodology. The downscaling methodology used in this study is similar to most studies (Dao et al., 2018 ), i.e. based on the fair share principle according to population size. However, it is fundamentally policy-oriented and may cause ethical implications. So far, scholars have yet reached a consensus on how to distribute equitably. Future research could combine top-down and bottom-up approaches to better address the narrowing of PBs, which will contribute to advancing the SJOS framework. Moreover, as the atmospheric aerosol loading boundary, one of the planetary boundaries, has not yet been quantified, the environmental performance indicators in this study are all green development or environmental pressure indicators. Consequently, no environmental quality indicators (e.g., air quality) are addressed. Future research could try to quantify this boundary and thus expand the dimension of “environment”.   5 Conclusion The objective of this study is to examine the possibility of maintaining a safe ecological environment while simultaneously pursuing socio-economic development. If this is not feasible, it will be necessary to determine whether it is possible to achieve human well-being while maintaining the planet's ecological integrity within acceptable limits in the future. To address these two questions, this paper presents a study of the application of the SJOS framework on a provincial scale, using 31 Chinese provinces as test cases. A decision-based methodology is developed that reflects the ecological state of each region and the current state of social development by identifying and quantifying environmental ceilings and social foundations. In addition to shedding light on the situation of sustainable development associated with SJOS, this work also employs an innovative approach by integrating LSTM and SJOS to predicting future environmental performance and social well-being. The study's results revealed marked regional differences in China's sustainability performance in terms of environmental performance and social well-being, as well as significant changes over time. Generally, the eastern provinces tended to operate in more eco-friendly contexts and reach more social foundations. Regarding environmental performance, the per capita resource consumption in most provinces of China significantly exceeded environmental ceilings. The trend of increasing environmental pressure across provinces resulted in a decline in environmental performance, moving away from SJOS. Regarding social well-being, 31 provinces generally performed well in food security and jobs, but poorly in social equity. Over the study period, social well-being in the provinces exhibited an upward trend. The forecast results indicated that no province would be in a SJOS by 2030. Environmental stress had decreased, while social deprivation had increased. Generally, the eastern region showed higher completion levels than the western and central regions (refer to Fig. 8 ). This study connects SJOS with SDGs, making it significantly relevant for the implementation of the SDGs proposed by the UN. For the time being, there is a considerable distance to traverse before the SDGs can be achieved. Unless we act now, the 2030 Agenda  would become an epitaph for a world that might have been.

Appendix A Global warming was assumed to be no >2 °C above pre-industrial levels, roughly equivalent to 350 ppm (IPCC, 2014 ). However, the latest research argued that global warming cannot exceed 1 °C above pre-industrial levels - even though it is clear that this limit has long since been exceeded (Rockström et al., 2023 ). As an alternative boundary, we assumed that global warming should be limited to no >1.5 °C. Studies showed that about 1900 GT CO2  had been emitted by 2011 (IPCC, 2014 ). Remaining cumulative CO2  emissions for a “medium” probability (50%) to stay below a 1.5 °C increase from 2011 to 2100 compared with pre-industrial level are approximately 550Gt CO2 , as shown in Table A1 Table A1 Cumulative CO2  emissions from 2011 in GtCO2 .
