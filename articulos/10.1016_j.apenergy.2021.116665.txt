                  The United Nations (UN) have formulated seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and thus, humans were trying to traverse the sustainable path. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged and forced out the ephemeral conventional approaches. Thus, the post-COVID world indicates the need for sustainable development and strategies in par with the ecosystem. The authors propose this study as a guide to direct the post-pandemic scenario into the sustainable pathway by prioritizing energy sustainability to engage the actions for achieving the SDGs. The analysis in this study commences with the investigation of pronounced impacts in the energy sector with its influence on the progress towards sustainability. To pursue the path of energy sustainability, a qualitative analysis is performed in a parallel approach from the key viewpoint of the renewable and sustainable energy transition, digital transformation of the energy sector and energy affordability in the post-COVID world. A SWOT-AHP hybrid methodology is employed to identify the significance of each strategy or issues to be focused on immediately in the post-COVID world. The study also discusses energy sustainability from political bodies and policy makers’ perspective, and the actual scenario where we are headed is revealed with the aid of process-tracing method. Furthermore, a novel quantitative analysis is established to represent the SDG’s interaction and the result shows that the SDG 7 is the underpinning goal in relative to other SDGs. In context with it, the mapping of energy sustainability to the sustainable world is accomplished. The ultimate inference from envisioning the SDGs through energy sustainability shows that a sustainable world would result after the pandemic. However, the changes in the energy market, investment preferences and more importantly, the decisions influenced by the political bodies in the post-COVID-world is decisive in achieving the same in a stipulated time frame.

Technical challenges  Description of observed technical challenges  Adopted strategies to overcome the challenges    Voltage increase Utilities in North America reported overvoltage due to load reduction during COVID-19 [7] . A utility in Oceania observed high voltage due to low demand [7] . Some utilities observed overall 6% to 9% drop in energy usage compared to the typical pattern [9] .  Utilities used automatic under-frequency load shedding (AUFLS) to address overvoltage problem [7] . Utilities used automatic voltage control systems (AVCs), STATCOM, UPFC and switched off capacitors to reduce reactive power injection [7] . In some cases, the 500 kV and 200 kV transmission lines were switched off during the low load period as a preventive measure [7] .  Change in load pattern Due to the COVID-19, utilities such as; New York ISO (NYISO), California ISO (CAISO) have experienced a reduction in demand between 10:00 AM and 6:00 PM and some utilities experienced a shift of morning peaks to later hours [9] . Utility in South America increased the spinning reserve at large hydroelectric facilities [7] . Utilities in North America used short-term load forecasting during COVID, which performs better in some cases [10] .  Network infrastructure risk Renewable Energy (RE) integrated network has the increased likelihood of reverse power flow and impacts in the protection system due to the change in load pattern [7] . Utilities and system operators in North America studied the loading pattern and forecasted the feeders to determine if the new load patterns presented any risk [10] .  Increase RE in energy mix RE output in the energy mix increases due to demand reduction. In Peru, due to COVID-19, 30% reduction in load demand was observed due to the suspension of mining works which increased the RE mix from wind, solar and hydro [7] . The California grid operator CAISO curtailed the solar output during daylight hours due to low electricity demand to manage the grid operation effectively [11] .     Table 2 Assessments tools to measure the SDG’s progress.     Tool  Description and application  Reference    IRENA FlexTool It performs flexibility assessments of power systems based on national capacity investment plans and forecasts. It is a data-driven assessment tool which takes input data from the user and then simulates according to the instructions made. [52]   SDG Impact Assessment Tool The SDG assessment tool helps the SDG stakeholders to develop strategies towards attaining the goals. [53]   UNDP Climate Action Impact Tool The target customers are the different stakeholders who would like to track the progress of their actions towards the commitments of the Paris agreement. The national contribution and actions towards the Paris agreement are a contribution to mitigating climate change and ultimately promote sustainable development. [54]   SDG Compass The SDG Compass act as a guide to companies to direct their strategies to align with SDGs and also, to manage and measure their contribution. [55]   Toolbox for Learning for Sustainable Development “Toolbox for Learning for Sustainable Development” developed by KTH, Sweden, has prepared this to help learn the SDG goals and learn the examples for the integration of sustainable development into teaching. [56]   Localizing the SDGs The UNDP, UN-Habitat & Global Task Force have initiated this toolbox and library, and this is helpful for those who are in need of pragmatic methods to focus on SDGs at the local level. [57]   SDG Toolkit The SDG Toolkit aims to engage European NGOs at National and European level on the SDGs. [58]      Table 3 SWOT-AHP analysis for achieving SDG 7.

Strategies and policy guidelines  Objectives  Achievements and challenges    Europe   European Union (EU)    European Green Deal (2019) [89]     The National Energy and Climate Plans (2020) Elimination of greenhouse gases emissions by 2050 Several EU members states’ have already adopted very ambitious targets for climate neutrality. For instance, Germany’s Energiewende strategy is aimed primarily at phasing out nuclear power and expanding the use of renewables [90] . France chose to give its highly technologically competitive clean energy sector a vital role in national economic growth. Sweden, Switzerland and Finland lead the rankings for most successful countries in terms of energy transition [91] . However, some Central and Eastern European (CEE) member states (e.g. Estonia, Poland, Czech Republic) are facing difficulties in meeting ambitious environmental goals since they still rely heavily on fossil fuels, while renewables and biofuels are less prominent in their energy mixes compared to the EU average [92] . Although the EU generally makes notable advances towards achieving environmental goals of energy policies, much remains to be done. In 2018, most of the Union’s energy mix (51%) was made up of petroleum products and solid fossil fuels, while renewables constituted only 15% [93] .  Asia   Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)    Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation (2016–2025) [94]  Non-binding target of 23% share of renewables in the total energy supply in 2025, compared to 9.4% in 2014 [95]  The ASEAN’s energy mix is dominated by coal, with an installed capacity of 62.7 GW as of 2018. On the other hand, its member states have a considerable renewable energy potential and plenty of room for improving energy efficiency. A number of large-scale investments have been initiated. For example, in 2019 the number of operational solar installations in Vietnam reached 102, with a total installed capacity of 6,314 MW [96] . In 2015, Malaysian government launched its Large Scale Solar Photovoltaic Plant action plan [97] . As a result, by the end of 2019 the country boasted 882 MW of solar capacity. Thailand’s solar manufacturing industry has also seen a significant increase in investments. The main challenges that remain are bureaucratic overregulation, insufficient coordination amongst government agencies and the private sector as well as insufficient capital.  China    13th Five Year Plan on energy development (2016 to 2020) China aimed to increase non-fossil primary energy consumption up to 15% by 2020 and up to 20% by 2030. From 1990 to 2018, China increased its coal consumption from 0.99 billion tons to 4.64 billion tons and coal made up 59% of China’s energy use in 2018 [98] . Despite signing the Paris Agreement, China remains committed to support the coal industry, which is inconsistent with its objectives. State authorities would need to phase out coal before 2040 under 1.5 ˚C compatible pathways, but it appears to be progressing in the opposite direction. By mid-2020 China had permitted more new coal plant capacity than in 2018 and 2019 combined, bringing its total coal capacity in the pipeline to 250 GW, and brought 10 GW of new plants online [99] . However, China is increasingly looking toward sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels, being a world’s largest investor in clean energy and largest world’s market for renewable energy. Between 2013 and 2018, the country’s investments in renewables grew from $53.3 billion to an impressive peak of $125 billion. This figure has fallen in recent years, but in 2019 China’s investments still stood at $83.4 billion – roughly 23 percent of global renewable energy investment [98] .  Oceania   Council of Regional Organisations of the Pacific (OCEANIA)    Framework for Action on Energy security in the Pacific (2010–2020) [100]  Secured supply, efficient production and use of energy for sustainable development On one hand, 85% of the regional Pacific islands states consumption comes from fossil fuels, which are mostly imported [101] , on the other, the region is extremely vulnerable to climate change which affect the sustainable development (rising sea level, more intense cyclones and drought). This creates favourable circumstances for renewable energy sector development. Moreover, the region is rich in renewable energy resources (hydropower, solar, and, to a lesser extent, wind). In May 2012, the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) agreed to the Barbados Declaration, which included a declaration on renewable energy targets by Pacific Island Countries (PICs), seven of which declared an ambitious target to generate 100% of their electricity from renewable technologies [102] . Meanwhile Australia despite adopting Paris Agreement in 2015, has not made a commitment in relation to carbon neutrality for the second half of this century.  Africa   The African Union (AU)    Programme on Climate Action in Africa (2015) [103]     Africa Renewable Energy Initiative (2016) [104]   Deliver at least 10 GW of new and additional electrical installed capacity by 2020. Deliver at least, 300 GW of new and additional capacity by 2030 Oil products account for only 15% of electricity generation across the Sub-Saharan part of the continent - this fact may help Africa to become the global hotspot for clean energy production [105] . Some clean energy projects have already been implemented. Significant potential for producing both solar and wind power has led to some promising cooperation between African governments and several companies which invest in renewables, including Siemens, Vestas and GE Energy. AU and the IRENA collaborated on Clean Energy Corridors initiatives in East, West and Southern Africa, with the view to advance the deployment of renewables [106] . Moreover, in Senegal, the first utility-scale wind farm, Parc Eolien Taiba N'Diaye (PETN) is scheduled to start producing 158.7 MW of energy for over 2 million people in 2020. Therefore, governments would be well advised to base their strategic planning on embracing renewables-heavy energy mixes, backed up, where necessary, by natural gas. One example of such a direction is Ghana, where multiple large-scale investments in gas-fired plants are made by METKA. In Nigeria, a number of smaller-scale solar projects are being implemented [107] . The Grand Inga Dam, to be located on the Congo river in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is the world’s largest proposed hydroelectric power station. The major challenges that African countries face in pursuing SDG 7 are high costs of necessary large-scale infrastructure investments [108]  and a still limited access to capital. In that sense, political, economic and legal instability creates risks for potential investors.  North America   United States    Energy Policy Act (2005) [109]     Strategic Vision  (2018–2022) [110]  Develop fossil energy technologies and usage of own strategic reserves Promote exports of domestically produced hydrocarbons and fossil energy technologies Most of the energy used in the U.S. comes from coal, oil and natural gas. In 2018, fossil fuels fed about 80% of the US’s energy demand [111] . In 2017 US president announced US its intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, effective in 2020 [112] . However, increasing availability of cheap natural gas and renewable energy, led to a decline in the share of U.S. electricity generated from coal—from 51.7% in 2000 to 27.4% in 2018 [113] . Renewable energy consumption is growing, but still constitutes a small portion of the U.S energy mix (11.4% in 2018), reaching of 11.5 quadrillion Btu, compared to 6% in 2005.     Table 5 Elucidation of Scenario A and B in line with political responses and policy implications.       Level of analysis  Political responses  Policy implications   Scenario A  Scenario B  Scenario A  Scenario B    Intra-state level • Reinforcement of market mechanisms and instruments.    • Regaining of control over the energy sector by governments.    • Liberalization of states' energy policies.    • State intervention on the energy market.  • Limitation of free competition principles.     International level • Reinforcement of international cooperation and harmonization of national energy policies’ international strategic objectives.  • Political support for a global green energy transition.    • Domination of rivalry and unilateral actions (actions without reference to the multilateral order and internationally agreed objectives (e.g. the Paris Agreement)).  • Green Deal contestation.  • Preference for interest-driven cooperation rather than common value-oriented cooperation.    • Further institutionalisation and consolidation of international energy cooperation  • Emergence of a new model of energy transition management.    • Redefining of the objectives of global energy interactions (departure from environmentally-oriented goals towards fast growth based on fossil fuels).

The United Nations (UN) have formulated seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and thus, humans were trying to traverse the sustainable path. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged and forced out the ephemeral conventional approaches. Thus, the post-COVID world indicates the need for sustainable development and strategies in par with the ecosystem. The authors propose this study as a guide to direct the post-pandemic scenario into the sustainable pathway by prioritizing energy sustainability to engage the actions for achieving the SDGs. The analysis in this study commences with the investigation of pronounced impacts in the energy sector with its influence on the progress towards sustainability. To pursue the path of energy sustainability, a qualitative analysis is performed in a parallel approach from the key viewpoint of the renewable and sustainable energy transition, digital transformation of the energy sector and energy affordability in the post-COVID world. A SWOT-AHP hybrid methodology is employed to identify the significance of each strategy or issues to be focused on immediately in the post-COVID world. The study also discusses energy sustainability from political bodies and policy makers’ perspective, and the actual scenario where we are headed is revealed with the aid of process-tracing method. Furthermore, a novel quantitative analysis is established to represent the SDG’s interaction and the result shows that the SDG 7 is the underpinning goal in relative to other SDGs. In context with it, the mapping of energy sustainability to the sustainable world is accomplished. The ultimate inference from envisioning the SDGs through energy sustainability shows that a sustainable world would result after the pandemic. However, the changes in the energy market, investment preferences and more importantly, the decisions influenced by the political bodies in the post-COVID-world is decisive in achieving the same in a stipulated time frame.   Keywords Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  Energy sustainability  SDG 7  Renewable energy transition  Energy policies  Energy affordability  Digitalization  SDG interaction    1 Introduction Humans thrived in this world through significant developments such as globalization, industrialization, green revolution, urbanization and is heading towards digitalization. But in most of these developments, the sustainability approaches aren’t incorporated and as a result of which planet reflected its vengeance in plentiful ways. Now, humanity being well-advanced, as they are nearing Type-I civilization, are in need of a matured development that imparts sustainability into their actions. This prompted the emergence of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as defined by the United Nations [1]  that directs humans’ action such that the humanity and the ecosystem evolve as a single self-sustainable system. Regarding the fixed targets by SDGs within 2030, it seems that the progress is not in par with the plan and necessitates much focus towards SDGs to cope with it. Despite the insufficient progress towards sustainability, humanity has to face an unprecedented time with the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a chain of impacts to humanity in every possible way [2] . Concerning the impact analysis, a study investigates the changes that have occurred in the society to tackle the pandemic and also, discusses various ways to fight against it with emerging technologies [3,4] . Also, with the current technological advancement, the prediction of COVID-19 cases is accomplished and many practical applications have been framed [5] . The post-COVID world necessitates the development of a resilient society that works in par with the environment. Hence, prioritizing the most vulnerable industrial and societal operations, and ensuring the planetary health and sustainable resource management are critical for overcoming the pandemic impacts [6] . In context with it, this study aims to provide a direction to the research community, policy makers, investors and government authorities to promote sustainability and to achieve the SDGs. As SDG 7 is the central hub to promote sustainable development which ensures energy sustainability, reliability and affordability for all, this study provides specific focus towards SDG 7 in the post-COVID scenario. The correlations used in this study to suggest a better direction towards energy sustainability involves a qualitative analysis of various impacts that occurred within energy sector. After which the energy sector is peculiarly focused to identify the grey areas for imparting sustainability in every aspect. Moreover, the view of energy sustainability in the post-pandemic era from the political world is presented in this study. Further, the connections between energy sustainability (SDG 7) and a sustainable world are deep-rooted. The hallmark of this study is that it encompasses the multidimensional approaches for achieving energy sustainability from energy production-end, consumer-end, social aspects, government and policy makers’ perspective. These multidimensional approaches are also backed up with further analysis via SWOT-AHP hybrid methodology, process-tracing method, scenario analysis and a novel quantitative analysis for SDG interaction. The novelty of this study is as follows:• Investigating the various impacts in the energy sector and correlating them with the degree of hindrance in energy sustainability progress.  • Detailing the key aspects of SDG 7 and approaches to consider in the post-COVID world – From energy transition and digitalization to energy affordability accompanied by SWOT-AHP meta -analysis.  • Presenting holistic approaches and operational recommendations towards energy sustainability from governments and law-makers’ outlook where process-tracing and scenario analysis methodology is employed to grasp the changes incurred by the pandemic.  • Mapping of SDG 7 to other SDGs – Nexus of SDGs interaction and strategies to effectively use the SDG interactions to promote a sustainable world with a novel quantitative analysis to establish SDG interaction.     2 Framework In this study, the overall approach to promote sustainability can be broadly classified under three categories namely, pandemic impacts, energy sustainability and sustainable world. Section 3  comprises of technical challenges and energy market impacts. For identifying the technical issues and mitigation measures, literature survey, and discussion among authors (technical experts) and utility authorities is carried out. Then, a robust survey of pandemic impact on energy sector which is obtained either from the reputed online sources such as World Economic Forum, International Energy Agency (IEA), IRENA or from journal publications such as Elsevier, IEEE, and MDPI. Apart from the obtained specific piece of information, sorting the impact data and eliminating the minor impacts is considered as a sequenced process to filter the impacts. Initially, the authors outlined that the best pathway to achieve SDGs is through energy sustainability since the energy sector was relatively remained unscathed compared to the impacts experienced by other promising sectors. So, to provide direction to SDG 7 or energy sustainability, three parallel approaches are presented which includes energy transition, digitalized energy sector and energy affordability. These approaches are proposed by investigating the changing issues in the energy market, energy production and consumption corners, investor nature and energy-related policies. Also, the role of emerging technologies in energy transition, digitalization and affordability is figured out and their influence to drive energy sustainability is detailed. Further, the strength, weakness, opportunities and threats for achieving energy sustainability in the post-pandemic world are analyzed and quantized using SWOT-AHP method in Section 4.4 . To be more pragmatic, one has to observe these approaches from political bodies and policies viewpoint. Hence, a general approach towards energy sustainability in the pre-COVID period from political bodies across Europe, Asia, Oceania, Africa and North America are analyzed. By utilizing process-tracing method, the changes in terms of political preferences fueled by the pandemic is traced and subsequently with the aid of scenario analysis, the authors conceptualized two extreme possible scenarios in the post-pandemic world. Section 6  explains the foundation that energy sustainability can offer to other SDGs which is accomplished by quantifying the complex SDG interactions. This interaction has resulted from a thorough analysis of SDG’s targets and indicators. Thus, multidimensional linkages are established to explain the journey from energy sustainability to a sustainable world. This study would act as a backbone to support the post-COVID approaches through all the analysis and investigations combined, especially for policy makers, investors, and political bodies. Fig. 1   represents the complete framework of this study.  3 Global pandemic impact on energy sector The pandemic due to COVID-19 clearly affected the humanity in all aspects of life such as; health, psychology, social condition, education, economic and also affected various supporting areas such as; technology, infrastructure, energy and operational processes. Hence, analyzing the impact of pandemic specifically in terms of energy sector would help humanity to thrive similar futuristic impacts and figure out the pathway for refocusing the sustainability goals. 3.1 Technical challenges, and strategies adopted to overcome them The energy sector directly faced various technical challenges including reduction in energy demand and variation in demand pattern. It eventually affected the utilities in terms of revenue generation and delayed their development projects. The peak energy demand significantly reduced due to the COVID-19 lockdown measures, and closure of the commercial and industrial (C&I) facilities have direct implications in revenue and capital investment projects [7] . The peak demand dropped in the range of 3–4% as in Italy to about 26% in India and the demand dropped in other countries as well such as; Spain (15%), Australia (6.7%), Bangladesh (20%), France (14.8%), Portugal (6.4%), Belgium (6.1%), Netherland (5%), Germany (4.9%), UK (6%), Singapore (8%) and China (7.8%) [8] . The change in load demand and deviation of usual load pattern has a significant challenge in network operation and different utilities managed these challenges in various ways during the COVID-19 period as summarized in Table 1  . In addition to the above specific challenges, the grid modernization effort also gets challenged. The grid modernization is essential to handle the bidirectional power flow introduced by the RE based distributed generators. Due to COVID-19 restriction, a large workforce is working from home using digital technologies, which increases the risk of potential cyberattacks on networks, substations, and control centers. This was also reported by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in US and National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) in UK [7] . The good side of COVID-19 related restriction is found in the temporary emission reduction. Due to COVID-19, the air traffic almost stalled and the road traffic also significantly dropped, therefore a preliminary forecast expects a 9% reduction (or 400 million tons of CO2 ) of EU’s cumulative 2020 emission target [7] . However, to keep the pollution levels lesser in the post-pandemic period, immediate responses such as; reducing the dependency on fossil fuels and enhancing energy efficiency would be highly beneficial [12] . The policy and decision-makers, the authorities in the energy sector should carefully examine these circumstances such that the development appeals more promising to support sustainability.  3.2 Impact on global energy market The energy demands and prices of energy resources (especially fossil fuels) have declined. According to the IEA Oil Market Report – April 2020, global oil demand is expected to fall by a record 9.3 million barrels per day (mb/d), year-on-year in 2020. To add upon it, demand in April 2020 was estimated to be 29 mb/d lower than a year ago, down to a level last seen in 1995 [13] . Thus, the oil export-dependent economies have particularly become vulnerable to COVID-19, suffering not only from price reductions but also from the disruptions of the labor market caused by the lockdown [14] . Fig. 2   shows the price drop and fluctuations incurred in West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent Spot prices in 2020 [15] . The oil market stakeholders took certain steps such as cutting the oil production unilaterally as an immediate response to the COVID-19 crisis (e.g. the OPEC + agreement). This may serve as a new coordination practice for the global energy market to attain the global energy transition objectives [16] . The pandemic also resulted in a substantial reduction of coal extraction in the long run [17]  and the governments may choose to exploit the circumstances to speed up the energy transition by reducing the share of coal in the country’s future energy mix. COVID-19 has stalled the whole renewable energy sector’s progress through a wide range of menaces caused in manufacturing facilities, supply chains and thus, significantly slowed down the shift towards the renewables. For example, in Australia, the progress upto 3GW of renewable energy projects have been stalled or deferred and in India, 21% or 3GW of wind and solar projects also faces a similar situation [18] . The IEA has forecasted that the net expansion of renewable electricity capacity will fall by 13% in 2020 compared to 2019 [19] . Fig. 3   depicts the impact of COVID-19 on renewable growth market. While all energy market sectors have been affected by the pandemic crisis, the consequences were different for each branch. Surprisingly coal was the least hit from fossil fuels. The intensity with which the COVID-19 crisis impacts the energy markets is being shaped by the degree of political stability in specific states and regions which is greatly dependent on their internal coherence and capabilities [21] . To boost the growth of renewables, incentives and low-interest rates for implementing new projects would help in maintaining the pace of renewable energy sector growth in the post-COVID world. The impact of pandemic on the energy sector was initially observed as temporary, which may indicate that the progress towards SDG 7 by the nations is not profoundly affected. However, the short-term management of a crisis doesn’t reveal the reality as the SDGs are much interdependent and are affected in unprecedented ways [22] .   4 Journey towards SDG-7 in the post-COVID world The post-COVID world demands sustainable development but the recovery period requires economy oriented approach [23] . This dilemma makes us to promote energy sustainability since the benefits get align with both economical and sustainable developments. In this Section, the factors influencing the energy sustainability from post-COVID scenario aspects are discussed. 4.1 Renewable and sustainable energy transitions – An indispensable way to go in post-COVID scenario It is well known that harnessing renewable energy is the cleaner and greener approach that will turn the table in favor of both humanity and the ecosystem. The technological assessment indicates that the transportation and building sector has huge opportunities to reduce emissions [24] . Buildings can be employed with energy-efficient technologies and depending on various geographical regions, retrofits of heat-pump or cooling systems with efficient thermal management and smart systems can be installed which would ultimately lower the energy consumption [25,26] . Innovations on building energy storage systems and improving passive cooling systems can also help in minimizing the power consumption. Also, thermal storage tanks integrated with renewable-based heating for a community could pave the way for economic viability to spend as a group rather than individual facilities and would make fuel switching more appealing. If the post-COVID world sees a spike in Electric Vehicle’s market in the transportation sector, it would hasten the digital revolution in wide-field ranging from smart grid to autonomous vehicles. This also drives the innovations required in the battery systems to improve efficiency and energy density, which will also favor fuel cell penetration in the transportation sector. Huge investments and development progress are required for the large-scale production and storage of hydrogen so as to see a change in terms of pollution mitigation in both lands and oceans [27,28] . Meanwhile, the focus should shift from fossil fuel based hydrogen production to renewable energy based green hydrogen production [29] . Nevertheless, this would also induce renewable energy-based grid expansion. Regarding the investments, attention should be given to improve energy efficiency and direct use of renewables in both the industrial sector and building sectors. The increasing preferences and investment trend in wind and solar PV technology should face pronounced acceleration. On the other hand, risk mitigation investments would attract specific instrumentation and technologies that would encourage developing and emerging markets in the post-COVID world [30] . The investments in energy transition would give positive impacts throughout 2030 and trigger the additional GDP growth through changes in policy, consumer behavior, price effects, and other induced effects and trade [30] . When considering the employment opportunities, an analysis by IRENA comprehends that the job gained from the energy transition outpaces (three times more job opportunity) the job lost in fossil fuels globally [30] . Fig. 4   represents the employment potentiality of the energy transition. The employment intensity varies from one technology to the other. However, to enjoy the employment benefits of the energy transition, a holistic approach is required in policy-making so as to change the labor market dynamics through reskilling for distributing the skilled and unskilled workers across all the fragments of the value chain. Moreover, the transformed energy sector necessitates improved market design that favors flexibility in the short-term through appropriate price signals [31] . And electricity trading across boundaries is a preferred upgradation to enhance market stability. Moreover, the energy transition would ensure the climate goals and to aid in such progress, governments and energy policies have bigger roles to play. Installing carbon capturing systems would be capital intensive and it is practically not feasible to promote immediately in the post-COVID world [32] . But it is possible to reduce the sources that generate huge carbon emissions by incorporating an eco-friendly approach and in such cases, integrated modelling assessment would be helpful [33] . As a strategy, multiple industries can form a cluster to achieve a specific target. This approach would be more effective to stimulate socio-economic benefits, yields prioritized targeted supply chain and improves national and regional partnerships which all eventually favor sustainability. For example, Germany and the Netherlands have focused on developing national hydrogen supply chains [33] . In line with the lack of capital and renewable resources, alternate sustainable ways for producing bio-fuels or renewable natural gas from waste can be explored [34] . Besides, the accelerated transition would also encourage the research community to engage with much more pragmatic resources for research analysis that ultimately strengthens the renewable energy sector. Also, assessing the geographical renewable energy potential by the research community would be of great contribution. One such approach was conducted in studies for India, and their states along with challenges and policy requisites [35–39] . Expediting the process of innovative project evaluation and approval processes, and issuance of permits would boost the confidence of pioneering startups or companies. Further, COVID-19 completely disrupted cross-border supply chain. Hence, it is essential to diversify the supply chain based on geographical criteria apart from economic criteria alone. Also, easing entry barriers for newcomers would foster the energy transition phase and revert numerous socio-economic benefits [40,41] . Furthermore, from policies perspective, we are in need of innovative policy mechanism that aids sustainable development in a cost-effective manner [42] . A study highlights such policies that include fossil-fuel subsidy swap to promote clean energy transition, distributing the renewables to rural and remote areas and applying carbon tax [43] . All these policies would prompt the development in renewable and sustainable energy domains. Fig. 5   summarizes the aspects of renewable and sustainable energy transition and strategies to achieve the same. Furthermore, to nurture sustainability to the nature of energy sector, the developmental approaches in various energy applications should be narrowed such that it necessitates or supports renewable energy transition. However, the transition in the energy sector is expected to follow the overall economic recovery and the native players in the energy sector will also act as a detrimental factor to shape the fortunes of energy sector. The neoteric oil price reduction and the uncertainties in the investment returns on fossil fuels could shift more attention to the renewable energy business. But the influence of economic impact, policies and governmental roles in developing and developed countries in the post-COVID-19 era is much complicated that would ramify different perspectives on oil and gas price mitigation and reverberate different degrees of influence on renewables notably by the type of renewables and geographically available energy potentials.  4.2 Digital energy sector – A promising transformation to sustainability With the advances in information and communication technologies within the last decade, the global investment in digital energy solutions has raised by 20%, year-on-year, since 2014 and it has exceeded US$50 billion [44] . According to a report from the IEA, modern digitalization may save around US$80 billion per annum or about 5% of total annual power generation costs [45] . The integrated management incorporating distributed energy resources (DER), energy storage systems, microgrids, plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), demand-side management (DSM), transmission system, energy efficiency measures and cybersecurity of the grid infrastructure requires the processing of massive amount of data using various intelligent software tools in a real-time environment, which would only be possible with the existence of a digital infrastructure [7] . 4.2.1 Aspects of the transformation The integration of renewable energy resources into the energy system requires analysis of technical and non-technical challenges and optimization studies which is expedited by the computer-aided software analysis. Application of real-time data loggers and continuous software simulation enables optimal system performance. The pre-feasibility and techno-economic analysis of a renewable energy-based hybrid system also requires data-driven decision-making capability. The recent machine learning methodologies, deep learning and camera-based imaging are assisting to produce precise forecasting of the resources. This enables the system to operate more efficiently. Advancements in digital technologies are also enabling the concept of the virtual power plant (VPP). VPP needs the digital platform, which allows consumers to aggregate several DERs that dispatches like a single conventional generator. Smart Grid is a gradual development process that nurtures innovations in technologies that yields optimized and efficient energy utilization and management. The smart grid links various customers, market equipment and assets together with intelligent sensors to create a smart platform. Smart Grid makes the power system secure and reliable, economical in operation, interactive and real-time responsive [46] . As the communication infrastructure is a vital element of smart grid; coordinated measures are needed to ensure data safety, data protection and interoperability of the systems [47] . To add upon it, recent trends follows the smart grid associated digitalization approaches in some of the European countries [47] . Emerging blockchain technologies would make the energy sector more secured, economic, data-driven, transparent, capable of customer-oriented decision-making ability, which in the long run, makes the system more sustainable. It would facilitate an open marketplace to coordinate energy sources and loads, storage devices, electric vehicles, variable renewable energy resources, and microgrids in real-time. Blockchain offers innovative solutions to consumers and renewable systems to actively take part in the energy market. The implementation challenges would be to overcome the current ingrained situation by proposing the new outline of data standard and policies for the regulators and energy network stakeholders and continuously adapting to evolving cybersecurity measures [47] . During any unforeseen pandemic event like COVID-19, these data-driven technologies would ensure a well-organized operational strategy of the sustainable power and energy system. Cointelegraph has presented an example of VeChain’s success in using blockchain technology in Shanghai Gas, China [48] . Thus, a multi-stakeholder innovation ecosystem and coherent management systems would prevail as an understructure to support the blockchain technology [49] . In the energy sector, the Internet of Things (IoT) solutions incorporate machines and data analysis to help improve decision making, reduce susceptibilities and thus improve operational efficiency [50] . IoT facilitated sensors and devices can provide minute-level resource data, market dynamics and monitor system equipment to increase safety and reliability. By 2020, around 50% of the US$5 billion worth of manufacturing companies in the world would adopt a digital twin technology facilitated by IoT and machine learning mechanism to model their production and monitor the key performance indicators [50] . Some of the application areas and benefits of IoT applications are [51] : (i) Remote asset monitoring and management (ii) Integrate more distributed energy resources in the Smart Grid environment (iii) Autonomous monitoring and tracking of the energy supply stream (iv) More consumer-oriented billing and financing system (v) Improved network management. Artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are the technologies that would revolutionize the power and energy system by analyzing massive amount of data to facilitate the decision-making for the generation, transmission and distribution of energy. It is essential that the power and energy utilities and operators and policymakers recognize the contributions of these remarkable technologies that would turn the entire sector digital and facilitate the nations to achieve the UN SDG targets well ahead of time. Fig. 6   depicts the barriers currently faced by the energy sector in order to modernize along with the recommendations to overcome these barriers.  4.2.2 Assessment tools Many countries are targeting to achieve the SDG goals well ahead of time despite the challenges they are facing. The digitalization approach has enabled the society to employ few assessment tools to measure the success of achieving the goals. Table 2   provides a brief introduction to these tools.  4.2.3 Financial modelling Experts working in the power and energy sector expect that the existing business model would transform in future. The role of analysts in terms of providing recommendations to the corporate field is significant in shaping the financial model to adopt SDG compass [59] . If digitalization is well-established, complex decisions could also be accomplished through decision analysis for a sustainable and efficient finance model even under uncertainties [60] . The technological developments of energy efficiency, demand-side management, blockchain, smart grid and the like, would significantly impact the market. However, new fossil fuel technologies such as shale oil, tight oil are creating influences in the energy market. The geopolitics and energy security of nations will play a vital role in deciding the world’s energy resource front-runner. Hence, financial and business models of energy initiatives need to consider all these unforeseen situations and the governments need to make investments by keeping in mind the role of energy security [61] .   4.3 An outlook on energy affordability The energy sector is currently facing a ‘trilemma ’ between cleaner energy, energy access and security,  and energy affordability . A little importance is dispensed for energy affordability in relation to the need for cleaner energy and energy security. Indulging public in the energy transition is a great way to hasten the sustainability progress but it is possible only through highlighting the affordability factor at the consumer-end. Often, energy affordability is perceived from an individual’s perspective rather than societal aspects [62] . From energy production end, affordability is seen as the potential economic profitability in context with investments received. On the other hand, governmental approaches and energy policies can be effective in cleaner energy objectives while they remain ineffective with uncertainties involved in promoting energy affordability. Thus, as a whole, energy affordability is a complex factor that requisites multidimensional strategies and favorable scenarios in both production and consuming corners. The energy companies need to adapt the perception of energy affordability and understanding the various beliefs that drive consumer communities through valid research would force out the gap between the energy sector and the consumer end [62] . Affordability also influences the global electrification rate. Electrification offers multifold benefits to both production and consumer ends. Menghwani et al. details the aspects of electricity affordability and its influence to hasten the progress for achieving SDG 7 with two principle approach of justice – equality and equity [63] . On the other hand, fuel affordability is well diverse from householder’s perspective and how to approach such diverse and complex problem through policies effectively still remains a big question [64] . Affordability at the consumer-end is possible only when either the cost per watt decreases or the economic status of the consumer increases. Thus, eradicating poverty will also contribute in solving these complex affordability issues. To add upon this, a study indicates that the households having higher housing costs, could not afford the electricity bills [65] . Hence, poverty and living environment can influence energy affordability in multiple views. At this point, SDG 7 works along with SDG 1 without which, energy affordability would pertain to be an arguable issue. There also exist many well-known energy affordability measures such as Ten Percent Rule (TPR), Low Income High Cost (LIHC) indicator, Minimum Income Standard (MIS), two times median expenditure share (2 M), Relative income Poverty Line (RPL) [66–71] . Peter and Rudolf [72]  analyzed the dynamic behavior of a number of affordability measures and infer that modified LIHC indicator combines several defining characteristics of energy affordability that can be incorporated for controlling the outcome of implemented measure whereas policy decisions can be influenced by TPR for its simplicity. The social acceptance of energy vision is purely dominated by energy affordability together with sustainability. But affordability is a much preferable characteristic than sustainability at the community level. And even trust at the consumer-end influences the development, energy research and policy implications [73] . Thus, the energy market should see a plethora of changes to impart affordability during the progress of energy transition. Only when the technologies yield a prospective profit to support the economy, the factor of affordability can be driven to the end-users. The economic constraints include life cycle cost, investments and operational cost. A study reveals that the calculated economics of scale factor for RE-based microgrids is 0.9 (out of 1.0), which implies a very weak economy of scaling, meaning a less profitable investment [74] . Moreover, the operating cost of RE-based microgrids is significantly higher than non-conventional energy based microgrids (but it is expected to be competitive by 2025) and the investment cost increases with the increased share of renewable energy usage [74] . The investors may invest only based on technical profitability and in such cases, microgrids might be less preferable from investing point of view. But, when considering a PV, diesel generator and battery energy storage system as a coherent unit, it acts as a feasible cost-effective solution for supporting hybrid renewable energy microgrids [75] . Hence, it is recommended to promote production-based governmental policies in the case of high market entry barriers while investment-based governmental polices is effective in market places with fewer entry barriers. In future trends, decentralized energy generation and management might prevail and, in such a case, the customers also act as investors, which induces different effect on energy affordability [76,77] , notably favorable. Local RE generation, regional energy storage and the development of efficient technologies are crucial in favoring the progress in the track of energy affordability [78] . Structuring the market dynamics and investment scenarios in appropriate technologies would yield better outcomes. Further, improving the competition in the energy business would ultimately benefit us with better strategies to achieve the goal. Besides, policies should account the views from various energy bodies and the outcomes should be evaluated and a closed-loop policy approach is substantial.  4.4 SWOT-AHP analysis for achieving SDG 7 in post-pandemic scenario The previous sections provided the key insights for directing the measures towards SDG 7 in the post-pandemic world. Besides, the strategies or issues for which the experts, policy makers and researchers need to prioritize their attention demands further analysis. To identify the critical factors from the discussed issues and strategies, SWOT (Strengths, Weakness, Opportunities and Threats) analysis can be applicable. Moreover, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) can be used to rank the list of factors. The hybrid SWOT-AHP analysis is used in this study to summarize the qualitative analysis and also, to quantitatively represents the importance of the considered factors. Such methods are already well-established in areas such as; agricultural biogas plants [79] , energy management in companies [80] , photovoltaics in energy transition [81]  and photovoltaic diffusion studies [82] . The authors have selectively chosen the most crucial strategy or issue from the discussions in Sections 4.1 –Section 4.3  and is represented as SWOT factors. The AHP analysis is performed among the factors within each category of SWOT such as Strength, Weakness, Opportunity and Threat, which is treated as local level analysis. In AHP, a n × n    matrix is formed in which n number of factors is allocated in both row and column. The pairwise comparison score between the i th  row factor and the j th  column factor is assigned in the matrix element ‘aij  ‘. A nine-step scale demonstrated by Saaty [83]  is employed for assigning the weightage to each pairwise comparison as shown in Table A2  (Appendix). This weightage is provided from the viewpoint of the most important strategy or issues that requires to be focused in the post-pandemic situation. And according to the AHP methodology, the value of aji   element should be the reciprocal of aij   element [83] . The weightage column matrix is obtained by normalizing the matrix. Then the eigen value is found from which the Consistency Ratio (CR) for the assigned weightage (pairwise comparison score) is derived. The CR should be lesser than 0.1 or 10% to substantiate the AHP analysis. Meanwhile, the AHP is also performed among the four categories of SWOT (global analysis). The resulted weightage for each category is multiplied with the local priority to obtain the global priority weightage, corresponding to each factor. The SWOT factors for directing post-pandemic period towards SDG 7 and their AHP results of local priority as well as global priority is represented in Table 3  . The detailed reason for weightage assumed for each factor (Table A1 ) and sample calculation is shown in Appendix A. Fig. 7   depicts the priority of each factor under the SWOT categories. From Table 3  and Fig. 7 , we can infer that the increasing preferences for harvesting solar and wind energy is a highly favoring approach for progressing towards SDG 7 and accelerating it further would drive other strength factors too. Among the weaknesses, the reskilling of workers prevails as the priority issue since the world is undergoing a digital transformation and moreover, energy transition with renewables needs different skills. Creating favorable environment for EV penetration is the best opportunity that humans can utilize to revamp the energy transition and emission reduction. On the other hand, the major threat to SDG 7 would be government investments in fossil fuels, and lack of sustainability as well as affordability focus in the energy business.   5 The perception of energy sustainability in the political world amidst pandemic This section highlights the various approaches adopted by the political bodies in pre-COVID period and provides insight into where we are headed in the post-COVID scenario. The section utilises the process-tracing methodology which involves an in-depth analysis of a sequence of events, also referred to as causal process observations to map the possible outcomes [84] . It is particularly important for examining the actors’ expectations and strategies related to energy sustainability as well as structural conditions that affect the decision-making processes. Following Beach and Pedersen’s distinction of types of process-tracing, the ‘explaining outcomes’ variant is found to be most relevant to this study [85] . Process-tracing contributes heavily to the description of relevant phenomena and the evaluation of causal claims [86] . In line with this approach, the section consists of three parts. First, we define approaches adopted by national and international policy bodies towards the SDGs in the pre-COVID era. Then, we capture the changes caused by the pandemic and trace the causalities between specific pandemic-related phenomena and immediate policy responses. These changes are then, elucidated with the aid of scenario analysis. Finally, we attempt to identify how international actors may change their strategic approach to achieve SDG 7. 5.1 Holistic approaches from international bodies and national governments in pre-COVID scenario The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2030 ASD), adopted by all UN member states in 2015, lists 17 SDGs. The issues of 'clean and affordable energy' (SDG 7) as well as 'combating climate change' (SDG 13) were named among urgent global challenges. Even before the pandemic started, most signatories had failed to meet the agreed targets [87] . The extent to which they have so far been able to comply with the agreement varies substantially. The contributions from the US, Russia, Turkey and Saudi Arabia are considered to be 'critically insufficient'. China, Indonesia, Japan, Argentina, Chile and RSA have contributed 'highly insufficiently' [88] . A majority of European states have performed 'insufficiently'. Only a handful of countries, including India, the Philippines, Kenya, Bhutan, Costa Rica, Morocco, Gambia and Ethiopia, have been able to curb the warming to below 2 °C and engaged in efforts to meet the 1.5 °C goal [88] . As a generalised category, the various approaches adopted by various political bodies are discussed in regional contexts in Table 4  .  5.2 COVID-19 pandemic as a game changer: Immediate responses and the changes in states’ operating strategies in the light of achieving SDG 7 While the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement provides certain widely accepted policy guidelines, the unilateral contestation of multilateral order (US or China position), encourage us to conceptualise alternative scenarios enabling a better understanding of dynamic situations and directions of change. These scenarios presented in the following paragraphs relies on the qualitative approach and the foresight methodology known as scenario analysis [114] . The scenarios described here include the pandemic’s implications for political stability, as considered both at the domestic (intrastate) and the international (global) level [115] . However, we are aware that the diversity and complexity of the international reality means that the actual course of events might fall somewhere in between the two extremes (Scenario ‘A’ and Scenario ‘B’) rather than strictly follow the lines suggested in Table 5  . Scenario 'A' represents possible governments' and lawmakers' responses to the pandemic crisis and reflects the principles of market-oriented economy juxtaposed with an environmentally-minded energy transition. It entails multilateral international cooperation which may lead to the emergence of a new model of energy transition management. Meanwhile, Scenario 'B' assumes the primacy of unilateral, interest-driven actions taken by states over international interactions. The economically demanding energy transition is being contested. 5.2.1 The changes that promotes Scenario A There are voices that a shock of COVID-19 has become another threat to the stability of the global system and, therefore, the post-COVID mandates the sustainability plan [116] . This section tracks the developments which are assumed to be conducive to the realisation of 'Scenario A'. Following the pre-COVID approaches, it may be claimed that the changes in social and environmental realities provide an opportunity to redesign the energy market and explore new opportunities. A clean energy transition may become an essential part of the post-COVID recovery process. It is already being projected that by 2050, 25.6 million people will be employed in the renewable energy sector worldwide – in 2017, that estimate stood at 12.3 million [117] . The casual mechanism involved in the process-tracing method for tracing the changes that results in Scenario A is elucidated in Table 6  . In reaction to fluctuations and changes caused by the pandemic, both national governments and international organisations declared their intent to utilise the new circumstances to strengthen the renewable energy sector, increase the overall energy efficiency of economies and pursue greenhouse gas emission targets [118] . However, actors have differed widely in terms of directions, scale and complexity of specific proposed actions. The greatest determination in continuing the green energy transformation has been shown by the EU. The €750bn post-COVID recovery package is designed to comply with the Union’s objective of achieving climate neutrality by 2050 and reaching new 2030 climate targets. The COVID-19 crisis has not really slowed down the European Commission’s efforts to push out the new binding legislative initiative, the European Climate Law, as a core element of the European Green Deal. Energy transition has been announced as one of the top priorities of Africa’s COVID-19 response. In May 2020, the African Union (AU) Energy Ministers agreed on a common strategy to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. This declaration opened the door for a wider dialogue between the AU and other multilateral organisations (e.g.: IRENA), with the view for supporting the development of innovative renewable energy technologies, improving access to energy across the region, building more resilient energy system and, finally, mobilising international financial support (including from the private sector) for creating more robust power markets and encouraging cross-border trade in renewable power [106] . Although in response to COVID-19 crisis, the leadership of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) reaffirmed its commitment to enhance energy security in the region [119] . However, the experts also noted that the regional response to recover from the pandemic shock was not fully aligned with the organisation’s general energy targets. Crucially, ASEAN has not openly acknowledged that clean energy transition was key to enhance the region’s energy security and access to energy in the time of COVID-19 [120] . Changes in consumer behaviours, market turbulences and rapid adaptive changes made by businesses pushed governments to redefine their operating strategies. While some countries (e.g. France, Germany or China) have recently committed even more to support clean energy transition through new or amended policies, others (e.g. the US, Russia, Turkey and Indonesia) have opted to throw massive support behind the fossil fuels sector [121] . Such a move is a first step towards the realisation of ‘Scenario B’.  5.2.2 The changes that promotes scenario B This section takes a closer look at the developments that are identified as being closer to the framework of 'Scenario B', where the key roles are played by national governments opting for goal-oriented cooperation rather than value-driven actions. The casual mechanism involved in the process-tracing method for tracing the changes resulting in Scenario B is elucidated in Table 7  . The case of the Saudi-Russian oil price war is a clear example of how political players take advantage of international turbulence in order to strengthen their own position vis-a-vis their major rivals. For the other actors, mainly importers of energy resources, the lesson from the story can be summarized as follows: in order to preserve one's own energy security and facilitate economic and social development, one needs to address international interdependency and avoid pure dependency. Therefore, one critical issue in states' energy security strategy remains the diversification of both energy mixes and directions of supplies (or delivery). Of no less importance is the use of their own resources. As economists predict that up to 750,000 people could lose paid work over the next two years, the governments argue that their moves can save domestic labour markets. Another example came in March 2020, when the Chinese government approved the 8GW capacity of new coal-fired power plants [122] . In Australia, the Federal and State governments are favouring the expansion of fossil fuel usage, without any acknowledgment that the world has to move away from them. Another manifestation of growing competition, nigh on rivalry, is governments' decisions favouring the economic growth based on heavy industry. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has moved to roll-back the Obama-era fuel efficiency standards for new cars and dropped a raft of anti-pollution regulations that affected the automotive industry. New regulations require 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026 - a far lower target than the 5% envisioned by the discarded rules [123] . In late March 2020, the US Senate approved a US$2 trillion rescue package for automakers and a massive bailout to its oil and gas industry [124] . In another part of the globe, the South Korean government is planning US$825 million bailouts of Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction Co., with no attached requirements related to promoting renewables [125] . Meanwhile, the Russian Federation’s economy is expected to decrease by over 4% in 2020, as energy revenues have collapsed and economic activity has suffered severe interruptions. Furthermore, the Caucasus and Central Asian countries, being dependent on Russia (economically and, to a great extent, politically), are suffering from mobility restrictions and a shrinking domestic consumption. The economic crisis which followed pandemic-related restrictions and lockdown will continue to increase the interdependency among states. What can already be observed and will likely continue to happen are the changes in power distribution among key energy market actors. These, in turn, may have serious geopolitical implications. COVID-driven developments question the potential of the emerging energy markets of the Eastern Mediterranean. The trust in the energy sector is damaged. The future of international energy infrastructure investment (e.g. EastMed) is now unclear, as is Turkey’s position. Ankara seeks to become an energy hub situated between Russia, Iran, energy-rich countries such as Azerbaijan and Europe [126] . When analysing the big picture, one should not overlook the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the position of Iran – a country which holds some of the world's largest deposits of proven oil and natural gas reserves (10% of oil and 15% of gas). The coronavirus and low oil prices have had a powerful impact on Iran's economy – a fact that only exacerbated the struggles caused by US sanctions in place since mid-2018. Iran has been the Middle East’s hardest-hit country. Its international isolation has increased. For instance, China's official purchases of Iranian oil are now at a record low [127] . The worsening social and economic situation has led some commentators to suggest that the crisis may lead to mass protests, domestic unrest and, possibly, even the destabilisation of the entire region. Several crucial energy market players (governments and energy giants from the private sector) see a fossil fuel-powered economic development as a key concept in their strategic planning for recovery. The vast majority of COVID-19 stimulus around the world, totalling US$509 billion, has been rolled out to finance high-carbon industries [128] . Therefore, it is possible that global fossil fuel consumption will not decrease but instead continue to grow [129] , which is a potential threat to sustainable development and achieving the UN SDG 7 within the specified time frame. Tracing the pandemic’s impact on the energy sector allows us to gain insight into novel causal mechanisms. For instance, states’ preference to favour fossil-fuel based industries and increasing competition may not only hinder the reduction of CO2  emissions, but also lead the governments to contest or even delegitimize the Paris Green Deal. What makes this scenario conceivable is the fact that G20 economies are responsible for 79% of global emissions [130]  and their approach will be crucial to the pursuit of the Paris Agreement goals. Paradoxically, an overly radical push to reduce emissions and force climate-related actions may also have adverse effects without due consideration for other SDGs. The less economically and technologically advanced states are often unable to influence global policy changes advocated by the more powerful actors. In order to reach international policy objectives, most countries need to enter into cooperation with technologically more advanced partners, which in turn increases their dependency on foreign, better developed and therefore, more influential players. In that sense, energy transition may consolidate the division of the global political arena into at least two camps: creators and imitators, or leaders and followers. This hierarchical/vertical order, in which dependency drives relations between countries, will undoubtedly impact the distribution of costs and benefits stemming from the transition, most likely in favour of those states which are better positioned to cope with energy revolution.   5.3 Steering the multilateralism in the post-COVID world To promote multilateralism, the bureaucratic politics mechanism to achieve the climatic goals should be flexible enough to include the essence of multilateralism. The conceptualized bureaucratic politics mechanism is represented in Fig. 8  . Here, the actor’s (country’s) preferences can vary from country-to-country and is also influenced by leadership and many other political factors. In this stage, the mechanism to include environmental and societal benefits to the climatic goals is crucial to engage the sustainable development. The action frame defines the multiple targets to the goal as well as the stipulated time frame for each target. This stage involves every action that is required to frame sound policy and political approaches before implementation. Further, this stage has many possibilities to engage multilateralism approach into the policy framework. Numerous support such as technological coopetition, trade market induced benefits, and improving the competencies in the action frame can be well-established. The execution stage should be focused on achieving the targets, gaining the civilians support, and monitoring the progress with the data collected. Further, a proper feedback mechanism to reshape the strategies and to improve the effectiveness in implementation is needed. In this way, the operational strategies in a political world can be shifted towards multilateralism, especially by tuning the actor’s preferences and designing a stable action frame to impart multilateralism characteristics. When interpreting with the pandemic situation, the governments and state agencies' immediate reaction to the pandemic and its economic and environmental consequences has shown the weakness of multilateralism and a general preference for unilateral, interest-oriented actions. Tracing the immediate responses of key world energy players points to tendencies closer to scenario 'B'. However, in the post-COVID situation, multilateralism approach should be practiced in order to develop a sustainable society for the future. More international communication and joint horizontal, holistic actions are needed if we are to preserve the consensus on the need for green energy transition and enhance regulatory strategies for meeting the Paris Agreement objectives. The role and position of international organisations have to be reinforced, as the return to the multilateral model for dealing with global challenges seems to be the most reasonable way to proceed. The said organisations themselves should properly utilise their institutional resources in order to work on detailed, practical solutions addressed at governments, private sector actors and energy consumers [131] . Of crucial importance is the rebuilding of trust in multilateralism, not only as a means for consensus-building and strategy conceptualization but also as a long-term practice for the operationalisation of balanced and comprehensive, common goals. National-level green stimulus packages in response to the COVID-19 pandemic seem to be a necessity. Governments may take advantage of the ongoing crisis and revise their carbon development operating strategies and policies. This, however, should be done with an awareness of the economic and social consequences of such a transition. Investments in green energy infrastructure - including energy efficiency, as well as low- and zero-carbon energy supply technologies - need to be carried out along with efforts to protect jobs and/or gradually offer alternative occupations. When it comes to investing in the renewable energy sector, some of the most relevant risk factors are detrimental, frequently changing policies, the lack of clear financial support scheme and deficiencies in the legal framework (its relevance, timeliness, precision etc.) [132] . The development of renewable energies and energy efficiency improvement are two significant components of any strategic energy policy shifts. Transnational companies are an essential target group since their activities have worldwide consequences and impact. Experts name some international corporations – such as Patagonia, Tesla, IKEA or Alphabet/Google – among leaders in combating climate change, pointing to their ambitious goals and efforts to provide technological solutions [133] . However, to make individual states' post-COVID responses more relevant and efficient, a greater extent of international cooperation is required [134] . There is a clear need for long-term institutional initiatives equipped in management and evaluation mechanisms, preferably under the umbrella of well-established international organisations.   6 Mapping the SDGs – The linkages from energy sustainability to a sustainable world Apart from achieving energy sustainability, analyzing its influence in fostering sustainable development would induce the actions of political bureaucracy. In context with it, this section is dedicated to investigate SDGs interaction and the supportive role of SDG 7 to other SDGs. Table 8   highlights the reverberations of pandemic impacts on 17 SDGs together with the energy-related solutions offered to overcome the post-COVID challenges. It can be observed from Table 8  that almost in most SDGs, energy sustainability would mean a significant support. Generally, there exists a complex interaction between various SDGs in which one influence the other to have a synergic effect or a trade-off effect [135] . Thus, understanding such interactions among the SDGs is pivotal to figure out the pathway to achieve the goal with fewer efforts. To present the SDGs interaction, a novel quantitative analysis is performed by the authors. SDG interaction can be interpreted in two ways. The progress in one goal can influence other goals while the progress in one goal can also depend on the progress in the other goal. In other words, the former means that the goal exerts an influence on  other goals and the latter means that goal is influenced by  (dependent on) other goals. And the influence or dependency can be either be synergic or trade-off in nature. Therefore, the interaction between the goals can be figured out by analyzing the targets and indicators of the goals to obtain an appropriate score (pairwise comparisons). This score ranges from −3 to +3 to depict the extent of influence or dependency and also, the synergic or trade-off nature. Table 9   shows the interaction score and the corresponding scoring criteria. The greater the value, the higher is the influence or dependency and the negative sign represents the trade-off effect while the positive sign shows the synergic effect. This is a simplified ranking method for exemplifying the interaction between various goals. Table 10   represents the pairwise comparison between 17 SDG goals. In the Table 10 , the left to right values corresponds to the representation of influence of the goal on the other goal. The top to down values corresponds to the depiction of dependency of the goal on the other goal. The cumulative influence score and dependency score for the considered goal is obtained by the summation of scores across the row and column, respectively. To map the interaction between all the goals and to find the most influential goal, the authors propose a new index termed as “SDG interaction index”.  The SDG interaction index is defined as the ratio of influence score to dependency score. The mathematical formulation is as follows.( I n f l u e n c e  s c o r e )  n  = ∑ i = 1  17  a in       ( D e p e n d e n c y  s c o r e )  n  = ∑ i = 1  17  a ni       where n is the goal under consideration and ain  is the interaction score corresponding to ith  row and nth  column for influence score while ani  is the interaction score corresponding to nth  row and ith  column for dependency score. The SDG interaction index for a given goal (n) is mathematically represented as follows.SDG  n   I n t e r a c t i o n  I n d e x = ( I n f l u e n c e  s c o r e )  n  ( D e p e n d e n c y  s c o r e )  n        From Table 10 , it can be observed that the SDG 13 has highest influence score while SDG 11 possesses the highest dependency score which indicates that SDG 13 can foster the progress in many goals and the progress in SDG 11 is dependent on the progress of other goal. Overall, when analyzing the SDG interaction score, SDG 7 tops among the 17 goals. Though the SDG 7 does not have higher influence score as SDG 13, it has higher SDG interaction score owing to its lesser dependency on other goal's progress. Thus, it can be inferred that focusing on SDG 7 will underpin the sustainable developments in the post-pandemic world. Fig. 9   represents the SDG 7 interaction with other goals. The energy transition is the first and foremost step in achieving SDG 7. This creates enormous job opportunities even if the fossil fuel-based power plants are outpaced and it lessens the energy importation which would also help in boosting the economy. As renewable energy penetration increases, industries would face more demand for supporting the energy transition and innovations would have piled up in renewables with the improved collaborative circles during an accelerated transition period. Besides, if clean energy dominates in society, then the necessary climate action and clean infrastructure will prevail in the society. All these fosters the required progress in SDG 1 (No poverty), SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth), SDG 9 (Industry, innovation and infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and communities), SDG 13 (Climate action), SDG 15 (Life on Land) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the goals). Apart from the SDG 7 interaction with other SDGs, there are also interactions within other SDGs which is elucidated in Table 10 . Thus, the influence of SDG 7 on other goals, in turn, be experienced on the goals which are not influenced by SDG 7 directly through various interaction mechanism. For example, the interaction of SDG 7 with SDG 9 is pivotal and SDG 9 is a crucial area of focus where most of the developments with comparatively much environmental constraints should occur. In such a case, clean energy penetration would help in revamping the environmental focused development in SDG 9 which ultimately helps the progress in environment-centered goals. This is also depicted in Fig. 9 . However, certain SDG’s progress would have a trade-off effect on the progress in SDG 7. To be clear, if the selected site for installing the renewables obstructs the ecosystem process, for instance, placing windmills in the bird migration routes, installing solar farms in a fertile region, deforesting and installing other power plants would mean none to sustainability. Hence, it is critical to consider the influence of trade-off effects especially by the SDGs 12, 13 and 15 while progressing towards a goal. In other words, effectively utilizing the resources, mitigating pollution in the value chain and supply chain and promoting the life on land should be prioritized in SDG 7. This is something that most of energy policies and strategies adopted by the authorities fails to address. A particular direction for the research community is emerging while considering this trade-off effect. Driving the innovations in recycling the solar panels and e-waste would greatly help to satisfy SDG 12 during energy transition. On the other hand, a well-established decentralized power generation scenario would eliminate the need for specific locations for power plants which all contribute to SDGs 12 and 15. As a summary, a promising way for achieving all the SDGs is mapped from SDG 7 which originates from energy transition. Focusing on energy transition with environmental constraints would create a pollution-free energy generation and create employment opportunities and boost the economy. This also means, solving poverty issues to some extent through which energy access and affordability problems can gradually eliminated together with the influence of quality education. With the rapid expansion of clean energy scenario, green approaches in SDG 9 will be well-established and innovations, especially in recycling, reusing, converting waste energy to useful energy, improving efficiency would all play its part in imparting sustainability in every action. Other changes that the world needs, revolve around plastic usage and disposal [137] . Such problems even require each individuals’ habitual change and preferably be substituted by eco-friendly products. Finally, promoting equality in all aspects and enforcing laws, policies, strategies to achieve the same would empower the sustainable cities which on overall builds an essential structure for a sustainable world and the system becomes self-sustainable to support the rest of the goals through the best possible efforts executed on each goal.  7 Discussions and conclusions In the wake of the pandemic, the whole sustainable development progress has been stalled and significant problems have been raised. It is evident that many solutions would emerge at this stage, but the solution which has the most sustainable characteristics should be prioritized and implemented. In this study, the global pandemic impacts are analyzed in energy sector and are correlated with their influence on sustainability progress. The technical challenges and issues faced by the energy sector include resource management, reliability and resiliency challenge on critical electrical infrastructure, variations in energy demand, change in energy consumption pattern, generation mix and market reliability, grid development/modernization work and carbon emissions. It is also observed that the fossil fuel price has fallen and it would influence energy transition at a certain level in the post-COVID scenario, especially in developing countries. Currently, the energy sector faces a dilemma either to follow the sustainable path or an economical path. It is destined to choose a sustainable path but the surrounding factors should be in a place to support such way, for example, the ultra-low interest rate for loans in developing countries to focus on renewables, tax exemption for renewable-based start-ups and the like. All the impacts and solutions infer that the investments in the post-COVID world have a huge role in shaping the futuristic world. In the post-COVID world, to achieve SDG 7, a parallel approach is considered from the vision of renewable and energy transition, digital transformation and energy affordability. The renewable and sustainable energy transition is now needed the most than ever as such a transition would also aid in expanding the employment opportunities and drive the market dynamics in a unique way. The strategies to accelerate the transition are presented from the lens of the power plant sector, transportation sector and building sector. The direction for where prioritized investment is needed and the employment scenario as well as labor market changes that are deeply driven (positively) with the energy transition is highlighted. Digital transformation of the energy sector supports the sustainable energy sector in many ways. The need for transformation is deep-rooted and the aspects of transformation are discussed from various corners such as DER, smart grid, blockchain technology, the role of AI, ML and IoT. Then, a prominent aspect of SDG 7 dealing with energy affordability is discussed from various perspectives such as production-end, consumers-end, investors end, government and policies. All the crucial approaches derived from qualitative analysis to achieve SDG 7 is subjected to a further meta-analysis via SWOT-AHP methodology to figure out the prioritized strategy in line with current pandemic impacts. From the analysis, it can be inferred that increasing the preferences to install solar and wind energy-based projects, reskilling of labors, promoting EV penetration and decoupling the investments in fossil fuels is the priority measures that underpin the energy sustainability vision. On the other hand, when investigating the favorability of energy sustainability in the political world, diversified approaches are carried out in both developing and developed countries. By observing the pre-pandemic political approaches and on interpreting the pandemic impact from political aspects, the post-pandemic approaches can be traced between two possible extreme scenarios as elucidated by process-tracing approach. One extreme scenario represents unilateral approaches while other extreme highlights multilateral approaches. The study claims that if the economic recovery is prioritized and renewable energy transition is avoided, then sustainability cannot be achieved in less efforts. Besides, the reality seems less promising with the weak responses to the pandemic and also with the plan for the rapid expansion of fossil fuel usage even in developed countries which exposed the weakness of multilateralism and highlighted a general preference for interest-oriented actions. To tackle this, the operational recommendations to shift the approaches towards multilateralism is also elaborated. This necessitates a paradigm shift of approaches from governments and state agencies to attain a state of balance between economic and environmental actions so as to impart the essence of multilateralism in the post-COVID recovery period. It would create a better world than a pre-COVID period or else much worse scenarios would arise if observed constraints are ignored. The significance of achieving SDG 7 lies in hastening the progress in other goals as it possesses the highest SDG interaction score. It means that the prerequisites to support other SDGs would be well-established when the sustainable world is built with SDG 7 as a foundation. A detailed discussion of how SDG 7 would foster sustainable developments in other SDGs through SDG interaction is quantitatively presented. The post-COVID world remains uncertain with a severe dilemma between sustainable development and economic development. Identifying common grounds and executing them remains effective in the recovery period while when a normal situation regains, much focus is required to be given for sustainable development. Whether achieving the SDGs within 2030 is possible or not, putting maximum efforts to attain them is what matters the most and should be the prioritized goal. Through this study, the authors suggest to vision sustainable development through the lens of energy sustainability .

Appendix A    AHP analysis for Strength factor (Detailed calculation)  The increasing trend of installing solar and wind-based projects (S1) is essentially important than collaborative sustainable approaches from industries and energy sector (S2), thus the comparison score yield 5. This is represented as (see Tables A1–A7 ) S1 – S2 : 5 Similarly, other comparison scores are S1 – S3 : 2 S1 – S4 : 7 S2 – S3 : 1/3 S2 – S4 : 2 S3 – S4 : 5 The remaining elements are reciprocal to the above non-zero values according to AHP method (aij  = 1/aji ).
