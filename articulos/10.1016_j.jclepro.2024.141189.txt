                  The adoption of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is expected to grow exponentially, especially as it offers efficient and cost-reducing options in an increasingly competitive business environment. The emergent business environment is facing increasing scrutiny and new regulations pertaining to sustainability. Hence, manufacturing in I4.0 is expected to contribute significantly to upping the sustainability quotient of businesses. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) based regime, articulated by the United Nations, provides directions for assessing business performance on the sustainability yardstick. It is therefore imperative to understand and delineate the implications of I4.0 in the attainment of specific SDGs. The current research explores extant literature on this theme along with interaction with expert focus groups, composed of practitioners and researchers. An Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) approach has been used to identify eight key SDGs relevant and applicable to manufacturing. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), was applied thereafter, using the Super-Decisions software to understand the relationships between the I4.0 technologies (I4.0T) and the SDGs. The final synthesized outcome from AHP prioritized eight I4.0 building blocks. Digitalization of processes and systems; additive manufacturing; big data analytics; cloud computing and artificial intelligence; and machine language were identified as the top five drivers facilitating sustainable manufacturing. Together they account for 80 percent of the sustainability effort in manufacturing. The study proposes a metric called the Technology Driven Sustainability Index (TDSI) for measuring and tracking the progress of the impact of I4.0 on sustainability in the organization's I4.0 transformation journey.

It includes Radio frequency identification (RFID) too. - With real-time processing of data, information availability, and transparency are ensured.  - The data facilitates greenhouse emission tracking and triggers actions on environmental issues.  - It ensures a better resource (material, machine, product, process etc.) utilization and thereby triggers scalability and cost reduction.  - It has the potential for predictive machine maintenance, end-of-life assessment, and customer data application.  - It has the capability to optimize/reduce energy consumption during the idling state of operation.  - The extensive use of electronic parts is likely to generate high levels of e-waste.  - It has an unfavorable impact on the low-skilled employment market.     Augmented reality (AURE)  Bai et al. (2020)  Human perception improvement through virtualization and exchanging information using ICT for manufacturing process enhancement. - It facilitates first-time-right designs and delivers robust manufacturing processes.  - High energy consumption coupled with high e-wastes are two major challenges.     Additive manufacturing (AMFG)  (Godina et al., 2020 ; Beier et al., 2018 ) Production of complex items using the layering process of the material. It is a digital resource-efficient technology. - It optimizes resource consumption, reduces no of sub-parts, provides new shapes, reduces inventory, customizes designs, improves throughput, and hastens new product development.  - It leads to low logistic costs due to its entirety of in-house production and facilitates a circular economy.  - High energy consumption, end-of-life processing, and waste management are critical issues to address.     Cyber-Physical System (CPSY)  (Ahmed et al., 2021 ) It is a system that integrates physical and computational elements to process data on a cyber network to monitor and control the physical processes in a seamless manner. - Application of CPSY can provide huge data to improve efficiency.  - It has the capability of reducing waste in the entire manufacturing value chain.  - It has huge potential in the circular economy application of cradle-to-cradle material flow.  - It can consume large energy and create disruption in the employment market.  - It can generate large quantities of e-waste.     Cloud computing (CCOM)  (Tim and Rana, 2022 ) Cloud computing is about providing a comprehensive computing environment that consists of analytics, relevant software, networking, large databases, and storage space with servers, to provide speed, agility, operational economics, and scalability. - It has the application of energy management systems software, e.g. - SaaS (software as a service) thereby supporting environmental sustainability.  - Application of IaaS (Infrastructure as a service) has resulted in making operations quicker, simpler, more  - It is adaptable and more cost-effective.  - It provides a plethora of real-time customer behavior data for designing new products and/or processes.  - Large network access and negligible maintenance make it affordable and cost-effective.  - Security risk and hidden costs when resources of underutilized.  - Lack of expertise in cloud computing is a sustainability issue. The large consumption of electricity demand for information and communication technology is a concern.     Artificial intelligence and Machine language (AIML)  (Vinuesa et al., 2020 ) Creation of machines and processes having human intelligence-related ability to recognize, react, classify, predict, learn, plan, and execute operations - These intelligent machines are expected to facilitate resource utilization, material, and energy resource consumption, circular economy, etc.  - It is likely to exacerbate inequality because of the old job replacement with technology-enabled skill jobs and the earnings, thereafter.

Handling Editor: Giovanni Baiocchi The adoption of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is expected to grow exponentially, especially as it offers efficient and cost-reducing options in an increasingly competitive business environment. The emergent business environment is facing increasing scrutiny and new regulations pertaining to sustainability. Hence, manufacturing in I4.0 is expected to contribute significantly to upping the sustainability quotient of businesses. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) based regime, articulated by the United Nations, provides directions for assessing business performance on the sustainability yardstick. It is therefore imperative to understand and delineate the implications of I4.0 in the attainment of specific SDGs. The current research explores extant literature on this theme along with interaction with expert focus groups, composed of practitioners and researchers. An Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) approach has been used to identify eight key SDGs relevant and applicable to manufacturing. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), was applied thereafter, using the Super-Decisions software to understand the relationships between the I4.0 technologies (I4.0T) and the SDGs. The final synthesized outcome from AHP prioritized eight I4.0 building blocks. Digitalization of processes and systems; additive manufacturing; big data analytics; cloud computing and artificial intelligence; and machine language were identified as the top five drivers facilitating sustainable manufacturing. Together they account for 80 percent of the sustainability effort in manufacturing. The study proposes a metric called the Technology Driven Sustainability Index (TDSI) for measuring and tracking the progress of the impact of I4.0 on sustainability in the organization's I4.0 transformation journey.

However, the expectations from the accelerating transformation of traditional manufacturing to technology-driven factories taking place across the manufacturing business world are high in terms of sustainable development (Bonilla et al., 2018 ). Technological advancements are becoming a major source of environmental deterioration, climatic shifts, and frequent catastrophes. Besides, research also shows that I4.0 technologies’ have the potential to impact sustainable development by offering sustainable industrial value creation across social, economic, and environmental dimensions (Vinuesa et al., 2020 ). For instance, I4.0 can drive innovation across sectors and create opportunities for better business management and building smart cities (T.E Dantas et al., 2021 ). I4.0 can also facilitate the government in horizontal and vertical integration that in turn will ensure the effective delivery of public services (Ajwani-Ramchandani and Bhattacharya, 2022 ). In fact, more recently I4.0 and sustainability are intertwined in sustainable manufacturing literature (Sharma et al., 2020 ; Bai et al., 2020 ). For instance, I4.0 technologies like IoT (Internet of Things) are utilized for low-carbon product innovations (Vinuesa et al., 2020 ), carbon-neutral infrastructure (Quafiq et al., 2022), e-waste management (Kurniawan et al., 2022 ), etc. As per World Economic Forum (WEF) founder Mr. Klaus Schwab, “Industry 4.0 technologies are rapidly changing the way humans create, exchange, and distribute value” (Nadkarni, 2021 ). Acknowledging the I4.0 potential, developing countries like India are also trying to address concerns and improve quality of life by creating sustainable products and services. In the year 2015, the United Nations adopted an agenda for Sustainable Development, which has become the lighthouse guiding the global economy with social equality and ecological balance in its radar (Tolettini and Eleonora, 2023 ; Spaiser et al., 2017 ). The agenda for sustainability was composed of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which had 168 targets (Collste et al., 2017 ) (Refer to Table 1   for details of SDGs). I4.0 Technological interventions have the influence of varying degrees on each of these 17 SDGs (Refer to Table 2   for I4.0T impact). For instance, Augmented reality (AURE) facilitates the designing by keeping the need for physical products, packaging, and transportation to a minimum (Bai et al., 2020 ), thereby contributing to SDG 12 of sustainable consumption and production; and SDG 15 of life on land. Similarly, Cyber-physical systems (CPSY) also improve efficiency by optimizing resource consumption, waste reduction, and ecological real-time monitoring and control thus SDG 7 (affordable and clean energies) attainment has potential in circular economy application leading to SDG 11 on Sustainable cities and communities (Ajwani-Ramchandani and Bhattacharya, 2022 ; Chunguang et al., 2022). In addition, I4.0 technological solutions can influence different SDGs because of sequential effects. An apt example is ensuring access to education and information which are critical for eradicating poverty, ensuring food security for everyone, and reversing climatic change (Frank et al., 2019 ). Scalability, cost reductions, and business process reengineering through communication technologies and scientific research are necessary for generating social and economic benefits (Khan et al., 2023 ). I4.0 technological advancements through renewable resources, sustainable public infrastructure, increased food availability, and eco-friendly products are a few ways that can help in the achievement of SDGs (Ghobakhloo, 2020 ; Ajwani-Ramchandani and Bhattacharya, 2022 ). To ensure that technological advancements and industrial transformations are harnessed to advance sustainable development, minimize unintended consequences, and promote inclusive, equitable, and environmentally responsible progress. It is crucial to study the effects of Industry 4.0 on various aspects of the SDGs. In fact, SDGs should become an integral part of I4.0 for ensuring sustainability throughout the technological innovations’ lifecycle. In this regard, the UNIDO (United Nations Industrial Development Organization) report highlights “I4.0 offers implications for both transforming and leapfrogging”. The technologically advanced sectors can “retrofit present systems to I4.0 for more sustainable solutions without repeating the mistakes of traditional development”. So, by embedding SDGs in I4.0 from inception to application; ethical, environmental, and societal considerations can be prioritized to create a sustainable state (Berawi, 2019 ). Thus, there is an imperative need for educators, researchers, social scientists, economists, policymakers, and industry leaders to understand this complex influence to facilitate the creation of a sustainable society. It is essential to investigate the extent to which sustainability aspects are reflected in various I4.0 technologies. Hence, the following research questions (RQs) can be formulated.RQ1: Are the growing Industry-4.0 technologies creating a significant impact on the 17 SDGs?  RQ2: Which are the vital few SDGs driving manufacturing sustainability in industries?  RQ3: How to prioritize I4.0 technologies in the industry 4.0 transformation journey?    There are many studies individually exploring I4.0 and sustainable development goals (Ching et al., 2022 ; T.E.T Dantas et al., 2021 ; Müller, 2021 ). However, only a few are exploring the combination of the two (Beier et al., 2021 ; Mubarak et al., 2021 ). In fact, literature on the impact of I4.0 technologies on sustainability is also rare (Piccarozzi et al., 2022 ). Research outcomes and studies related to the relationship between I4.0, organizational processes, and product innovations including diverse viewpoints on the implications of sustainability are widely available. However, there is a lack of research on the integrated interactions between I4.0 innovation and sustainability as well as systematic analysis of I4.0 innovation outputs with reference to sustainability consequences. To fill such research gaps, the present study aims to first explore the literature to identify I4.0 technologies (Beier et al., 2018 ; Bai et al., 2020 ; Godina et al., 2020 ; Ahmed et al., 2021 ; Tim and Rana, 2022 ; Vinuesa et al., 2020 ) and its impact on SDGs. Thereafter, the identified I4.0 technologies are studied to investigate the key manufacturing relevant technologies from them (Ahmed et al., 2021 ; Hassani et al., 2021 ; Guenat et al., 2022 ; Harris et al., 2020 ; Mattila et al., 2022 ). Moreover, the SDGs that are relevant to manufacturing are also filtered using Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM). The manufacturing relevant I4.0 technologies are then prioritized using an Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) with respect to their influence on filtered SDGs and eventually sustainable manufacturing. Based on the outcomes of the AHP application, a useful and novel sustainability metric called Technology Driven Sustainability Index (TDSI) is developed. SDGs are comprehensively targeting all sectors, but the authors, for this research, have limited their study to resource-intensive and global innovation for local market categories of manufacturing due to the following reasons: futuristic scalability needs, use of high natural resources, a wide range of customers, potential for technology intervention and relatively more sustainability focus requirement.  2 Background and literature 2.1 Industry 4.0 technologies The Fourth Industrial Revolution (I4.0), originally introduced by Germany in 2011 is an advanced manufacturing system driven by Information Technology (Khan et al., 2023 ). I4.0 utilizes technologies like big data (BD), the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, cyber-physical systems, 3D printing, etc. (Frank et al., 2019 ; Zhang and Chen, 2020 ). I4.0 elevates smart industrialization and advances digitalization through the Internet and communication technologies (Sanchez et al., 2020 ). The I4.0 technologies offer flexibility, efficiency, mass customization, effective resource sharing, leverage competitiveness, and innovative products and services (Oztemel and Gursev, 2020 ). I4.0 has immense potential to create sustainable value for social, economic, and environmental dimensions (Bonilla et al., 2018 ). For instance, I4.0 technologies leverage sustainable economic development through a reduction in set-up time, labor and material cost optimization, more flexible production, and increased productivity with customization (Sharma et al., 2020 ). Besides, I4.0 technology also has the potential to reduce energy and material consumption through robust production and supply chain networks (Sharma et al., 2023 ; Kamble et al., 2019 ). I4.0 technology further boosts sustainable environmental development by reducing carbon footprints through data-centered footprint analysis (Sarkis and Zhu, 2018 ). Furthermore, from the social development point of view, I4.0 technology supports its few aspects like employee health and safety by eliminating task repetitiveness and monotony (Muller et al., 2018). On the contrary, I4.0 poses certain disruptive effects on society and ecology (de Sousa et al., 2018), such as data security, e-waste generation, physical and cyber effects, and mental health issues (Mathekga and Sekudu, 2019 ). Based on the existing literature on I4.0 potential, integration of sustainability in the I4.0 technologies can possibly mitigate most challenges by shifting from a conventional approach to a more holistic approach i.e., from ‘doing things better’ to ‘doing better things’ (Khan et al., 2021 ).  2.2 Industry 4.0 technologies and sustainable development goals (SDGs) The modern world is characterized by climatic crises, loss of biodiversity, ecological imbalance, pollution, inequality, and social isolation (Tolettini and Eleonora, 2023 ; Sabau, 2020 ). Among all, the ecological imbalance is at its peak for the third consecutive year (WEF, 2019 ). Humans have exploited earthy resources for economic growth (Kopnina, 2020 ) leading to imbalances in the supply chain and social degradation (Sharma et al., 2023 ; Osten et al., 2017 ). Experts in this regard highlight the integration of sustainability across diverse disciplines (Bergman et al., 2018 ; Kohler et al., 2019 ). The Global resolution “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” aims to build an inclusive and sustainable future by the year 2030 (UN, 2015 ; Castro et al., 2021 ). In 2015, this aim was visualized in the form of 17 goals called Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (refer to Table 1 ). These goals were based on 3 pillars of sustainability i.e., economic, social, and environmental; and encompass planet, people, peace, prosperity, and partnership (EU, 2019 ) by building “a sustainable world leaving no one behind”. The realization of SDGs calls for cooperation at the global level and requires the formulation of interventions and policies and the mobilization of resources (Dalby et al., 2019 ). Existing literature shows a significant influence of I4.0 technologies on the attainment of SDGs (Celok et al., 2022; Chunguang et al., 2022; Khan et al., 2023 ). For instance, the advent of I4.0 has assisted in the creation of work opportunities in different sectors, especially Information Technology, hence contributing to SDG 8 of work and economic growth (Sabau, 2020 ). In addition, with increased globalization, developing nations are now moving and enlarging their research and development base to home cities because of the availability of low-cost raw materials and labor (Bergman et al., 2018 ; Manyika et al., 2012 ). Such change is not only incentivizing rural or suburban areas with work opportunities but also contributing to the SDG of equality. Several innovative and clean technologies have contributed to industry innovation and infrastructural development i.e., SDG 9 (Khan et al., 2023 ). Besides, the increased adoption of data analysis and artificial intelligence by the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) sector have supported streamlining warehouse operations and thereby improvising work-specific skill development with augmented precision (Kohler et al., 2019 ). This in the long term would result in transformation of work and business practices. Cloud computing technology can allow the government to implement e-service delivery by optimizing information and communication technology (Tim and Rana, 2022 ). IoT has multiple implications for the economy, especially for the agriculture sector because of digitalization and GPS-enabled tractors that optimize the routes during harvesting (Beier et al., 2018 ). Besides, the use of drones has proved to be a major strategic move that allows monitoring and regulated treatment of crops which significantly increases the agricultural output (Guenat et al., 2022 ). That is how I4.0T contributes to SDGs 1, 2, and 15. The Defense industry has benefited from 3D printing which allows exploring new design engineering opportunities. Additionally, the healthcare sector is also using 3D printing for creating prosthetic body parts, dental implants, and other human organ transplants. I4.0 is also contributing to SD 3 by nurturing habitat and energy conservation. I4.0 technology innovations are discouraging the use of environmentally damaging chemicals (Godina et al., 2020 ). This is made possible because I4.0 technologies optimize process, facilitate predictive maintenance, and make real-time monitoring a reality. Furthermore, data-driven insights and supply chain transparency of I4.0 encourage the adoption of environmentally friendly methods and products by lowering waste, improving regulatory compliance, and encouraging the choice of safer substitutes (Sharma et al., 2023 ; Beier et al., 2018 ). The concept of a green model town and urban greenery will result in urban prosperity and a better standard of life i.e., SDG 11 (Godina et al., 2020 ). The above research clearly shows the impact of I4.0T on SDGs. Besides, a detailed account of the impact of I4.0 technology (I4.0T) on manufacturing is compiled in Table 2 . According to current research trends, there is substantial overlap and connection between I4.0 and numerous organizational processes and product innovations that include multiple viewpoints on the implications of sustainability. However, there is a lack of research on the integrated interactions between I4.0 innovation and sustainability as well as systematic analysis of I4.0 innovation outputs with reference to sustainability consequences. This study evaluates a substantial corpus of scholarly literature to close the aforementioned gaps and identify future research directions. By obtaining the current state of I4.0-enabled inventions that promote sustainable development, it accomplishes this. The conceptualization of this paper is based on the Legitimacy theory emphasizing that organizations shall undertake all their affairs within the norms and values of the society (Archel et al., 2019 ). The rationale behind this theory is that the organization is also part of society and is extracting resources from it (Mahmud, 2019 ). Therefore, it is their moral obligation to not deteriorate society and try to give it back in any form (Chariri and Ghozali, 2019 ). Furthermore, there is a persistent pressure to conform to societal norms, values, and expectations to be seen as legitimate and justified entities (Archel et al., 2019 ). Thus, the mere incorporation of technology in the systems and processes may hamper the reputation and credibility of the organization. Organizations commonly employ various strategies to keep up legitimacy including transparency, corporate social responsibility (CSR) drive, and public engagement. Along the same line, this paper is conceptualized on the grounds that incorporating SDGs in technological upgradations can be an attempt to shape an organization's legitimacy and hold it accountable for its actions.   3 Research objectives The four objectives of the research study are.(i) Develop a qualitative understanding of the impact of the building blocks of Industry-4.0 on the 17 SDGs defined by the UN from the literature review.  (ii) Identify the vital few driving SDGs facilitating sustainable manufacturing using the Interpretive Structural Methodology (ISM) approach.  (iii) Compute the weights of the influence of the building blocks of Industry 4.0 on sustainable manufacturing and prioritize them by the Analytic Hierarchical Process (AHP).  (iv) Based on the analysis and results, suggest a sustainability index that can be used to assess and track sustainability improvement level by manufacturing industry leaders.    The objectives are well aligned with the three research questions defined in the Introduction section.  4 Research methodology The aim of this paper is to analyze the influence of I4.0 technology factors in achieving United Nations Sustainable Development Goals which in turn will help achieve sustainable manufacturing. To accomplish this, a qualitative understanding of the impact of the building blocks of Industry-4.0 on the 17 SDGs is done from the literature review. The structured methodology involved in the research is depicted in Fig. 1  . The three key approaches applied in the research are the focus group approach for expert inputs in the domain of I4.0, Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) for identifying the key driving SDGs in manufacturing, and the Analytic Hierarchical Process (AHP) for identifying the weights of I4.0 building blocks in terms of its impact on key driving SDGs. 4.1 Details of the focus group approach used in ISM and AHP The focus group approach is adopted for understanding the I4.0 impact on manufacturing sustainability and then scoring processes in the ISM and AHP methodologies. The focus group method allows for an in-depth examination of expert viewpoints and attitudes on I4.0 and SDGs linkage, which justifies it for the current research (Halliday et al., 2021 ). It encourages conversational interaction and the production of rich qualitative data (Malhotra and Dash, 2020 ). This method offers insights into participant experiences, attitudes, and preferences, within optimal money and time (Halliday et al., 2021 ). The demography of the five domain experts (I4.0 and Sustainable growth in manufacturing) considered in the research has been provided in Table 3  . The selection of the experts was based on the following two key factors: (a) in-depth academic and research-related knowledge of I4.0 and SDGs and (b) practical implications of the effect of I4.0 on SDGs in manufacturing industries and society. There were two rounds of group discussions with the experts which facilitated the ISM and AHP applications.  4.2 Identification of the critical I4.0 technological factors in sustainable manufacturing Firstly, potential I4.0 technologies for sustainable manufacturing are identified from multiple literature sources. All eleven I4.0 technologies are then thoroughly investigated in terms of their direct contribution towards SDGs. The process involved a rigorous review of the literature on sustainable applications of I4.0 technologies and expert advice on the same (refer to Table 3  for expert details). The 11 I4.0 building blocks have influence on the 17 SDGs with varying degrees, some have a significant influence, while some have no influence. There are some which have an indirect but supportive influence, while a few have a negative influence. Careful assessment of the I4.0 technologies with respect to (w.r.t) SDGs has eliminated the following three I4.0 blocks- Augmented reality (AURE), Simulation systems (SIMS), Blockchain technology (BCTE), and the remaining eight I4.0 technologies for further study and analysis. AURE was filtered as it had little relevance to direct manufacturing. SIMS can be considered to be a part of BDAN, while BCTE is still in the nascent stages of application.  4.3 Interpretive Structural Modelling application in the identification of critical SDGs for sustainable manufacturing The United Nations’ sustainable development goals offer a common yet comprehensive model for goal setting by organizations of any level (Spaiser et al., 2017 ). There are 17 SDGs on diverse concerns such as poverty, hunger, health, education, equality, clean water, etc. The SDGs ground our study for assessing the I4.0 contribution to sustainable manufacturing. Here, it is imperative to understand and analyze the relevance of all SDGs in sustainable manufacturing. The SDGs that have a very limited and indirect contribution to the manufacturing process are scrutinized in this step. Interpretive Structural Modelling has been applied for filtering the manufacturing relevant SDGs. The interpretive Structural Modelling approach (Ojha and Vrat, 2016 ), provides a useful understanding of the interactions between factors.1. First A 17 × 17 matrix (refer Table 4  ) is created for studying the variables under study. Expert opinion was solicited to prepare VAXO for the Structural self-interaction matrix (SSIM)  and subsequent Initial reachability matrix  (IRM) by replacing VAXO with 0 and 1 (Agarwal and Vrat, 2017 ).  2. Thereafter, the inherent transitivity in pairwise relationships between factors using Malone's approach (Malone, 1975 ) is studied. As per the approach, multiply the IRM by itself, and replace all figures ≥1 with 1. If the resultant matrix is identical to the initial matrix, reachability has been arrived at. If not, the process is repeated on the new matrix. If the matrix, so obtained, is identical to the previous matrix, transitivity has been arrived at. If not, continue the process till the penultimate and final matrices are identical. This is the Final reachability matrix  (FRM) (refer to Table 5  ).  3. Based on this computation FRM for the current research was developed and is shown in Table 5 . Define the ranking of each factor in FRM based on its driving power (adding all ‘1’ entries row-wise) and dependence power (adding all ‘1’ entries column-wise). The last column and row in Table 5  indicate the driving and dependence power of the SDGs.  4. Based on the driving and dependence scores, the factors are systematically structured using the MICMAC (‘Matriced Impacts croises multiplication applique and classment’  meaning ‘Cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification’). The factors find their position in one of the four quadrants referred to as Autonomous, Dependent, Linkage, and Driving. Each quadrant is identified by its unique characteristic. Fig. 2   depicts the MICMAC analysis of the interactions between the SDGs.    In summary, the application of the ISM approach has categorized the set of 17 SDGs into four quadrants: one in Autonomous, eight in the dependent quadrant, none in Linkage, and eight in driving quadrants, respectively. The MICMAC graph shown in Fig. 2  has identified the following eight driving SDGs- SDG4, SDG7, SDG8, SDG9, SDG12, SDG13, SDG15, and SDG17 as the critical few driving goals relevant to manufacturing.  4.4 Application of AHP in computing weights of I4.0 building blocks in achieving SDGs This paper has highlighted the contribution of I4.0 technologies to the achievement of SDGs for sustainable manufacturing. So, it is essential to analyze the influence of potential I4.0 technologies (from step 1) on relevant SDGs (from step 2) w.r.t sustainable manufacturing. The Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) process has been applied to calculating the weights of the I4.0 technologies SDGs (Thanki et al., 2016 ). The use of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) for decision-making is justified by its capacity to methodically organize complicated issues, rank criteria and options, lessen subjectivity, and produce quantifiable outcomes. AHP's consistency checks increase the outcomes' dependability, and its adaptability supports various choice settings (De Felice and Petrillo, 2010 ). It is a useful tool for this study as well since it ensures transparent, impartial, and informed decisions (Kutlu and Ekmekçioğlu, 2012 ). The steps followed in the AHP application are (refer Fig. 3   ).1. The first step is structuring the hierarchy of goals, its criteria/sub-criteria, and the alternatives (Ikram et al., 2020 ). So, the first level of the hierarchy contains the goal, i.e., ‘Sustainable manufacturing’. The next level depicts criteria that contain eight ‘SDGs’ identified in the previous step using ISM. These SDGs contribute to sustainable manufacturing goals at the macro level. The last level shows the alternatives that comprise eight ‘I4.0 technologies’ that are relevant to the achievement of the eight SDGs (Refer to Fig. 4 )   2. A pairwise comparison of all SDGs with respect to the goal i.e., Sustainable manufacturing is first done. Thereafter, pairwise comparisons of each alternative i.e., the eight Industry 4.0 technological factors are done corresponding to each SDG separately. The purpose of separately computing the relative weights of the I4.0 technologies is the varying importance of the same I4.0 technological factor for different SDGs. For instance, artificial intelligence and machine learning might bear higher importance for SDG7 than SDG4. A focused group approach is used for collecting responses from experts (Malhotra and Dash, 2020 ). A questionnaire was designed which consisted of all elements of the three levels of the AHP model. The questionnaire was mailed to the experts who were approached for preparing ISM-related VAXO.  3. Finally, the model is synthesized by accounting for the objective and subjective judgment of the experts, and the ranks and importance of each alternative i.e. I4.0 factor towards sustainable manufacturing (the macro goal) is determined (Sharma et al., 2020 ; Wan et al., 2021 ). This involves normalizing the local priority weights of all I4.0 building blocks combined together with respect to each SDG to obtain the global composite priority weights of all I4.0 blocks shown in the third level of the AHP model.  4. The software package called Super Decisions is used to determine the normalized priority weights. The consistency ratio (CR) of each criterion and alternative is calculated. As a rule of thumb, the CR value should be less than 1. The CR value indicates the consistency in assigning pair-wise judgments by the expert respondents (Saaty, 1990 ).      5 Results and discussions The application of the ISM approach has categorized the set of 17 SDGs into four quadrants: one in Autonomous, eight in the dependent quadrant, none in Linkage, and eight in driving quadrants, respectively. An empty Linkage quadrant indicates that there are no unstable variables having high driving and dependence characteristics needing high focus. Furthermore, there is just one variable (SDG16) with weak driving and dependence characteristics in the autonomous quadrant. The remaining variables are all either strong in driving or dependence characteristics. Most of the results in the literature from the ISM approach have indicated variables falling in the driving and dependent quadrants The MICMAC graph shown in Fig. 2  has identified the following eight driving SDGs- SDG4, SDG7, SDG8, SDG9, SDG12, SDG13, SDG15, and SDG17 as the critical few driving goals to manufacturing. Besides, the results from the application of the Super decision software show an acceptable inconsistency ratio for all comparisons. They are below the threshold limit of 0.1 and are shown in the respective tables. Further, the outcome of pairwise comparison of all SDGs w.r.t. Sustainable manufacturing nodes in the criteria cluster is shown in Table 6  . It shows the relative weights of SDGs w.r.t the goal of achieving the goals of sustainable manufacturing. The higher the weight of an SDG, the greater significance that SDG would have in sustainable manufacturing. The weights in Table 6  highlight that the three dominant SDGs facilitating the macro goal of sustainability in manufacturing are SDG8 (Decent work and economic growth), SDG9 (Industry innovation and infrastructure), and SDG12 (Responsible consumption and production), with each having approximately the same weight of 25%. The weights of the remaining SDGs are fairly low. Intuitively too, the outcomes look meaningful for the manufacturing industry. Sustainable manufacturing is closely related to SDG 8, “Decent Work and Economic Growth,” since it encourages job creation, ethical labor practices, and economic inclusion supported in the literature (Sabau, 2020 ) too. By creating green jobs, enhancing working conditions, and encouraging innovation, sustainable manufacturing advances both environmental sustainability and economic growth is ensured. Sustainable manufacturing is closely related to SDG 9 – “Industry Innovation, and Infrastructure,” which emphasizes the value of technical innovation, infrastructural growth, and advancement, among other things (Khan et al., 2023 ). By supporting innovation in environmentally friendly processes, encouraging infrastructural upgrades that support sustainable production, and encouraging research and development for cleaner and more effective manufacturing technologies, sustainable manufacturing supports SDG 9 (Amjad et al., 2023 ). A more resilient and ecologically conscious industrial sector results from this synergy. Sustainable manufacturing is dependent on SDG 12 - “Responsible Consumption and Production,” which places a strong emphasis on lowering waste, preserving resources, and limiting environmental effects. This has been substantiated in the literature (Ajwani-Ramchandani and Bhattacharya, 2022 ). By encouraging environmentally friendly production methods, effective resource usage, and the creation of products that satisfy customer demand while having the least possible impact on the environment, sustainable manufacturing supports SDG 12. The environment and society gain from this as production becomes more sustainable and accountable. The importance of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) like SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) in the field of sustainable manufacturing lies in fostering environmentally friendly production methods, the advancement of technology, and the creation of meaningful employment opportunities with respect for workers' rights. This dual emphasis promotes a balanced and sustainable approach to industry by guaranteeing that production contributes to economic growth while reducing its environmental impact. The results of pairwise comparisons of each I4.0 technological factor corresponding to all SDGs are exhibited in Table 7  . It shows the relative weights of the I4.0 technologies for each SDG separately. The highlighted figures in Table 7  depict that two I4.0 building blocks – Digitalization of processes and systems (DIPS) and Additive Manufacturing (AMFG) have high (a value > 0.3) and, together, encompass 7 out of the 8 SDGs. Hence, it would be advisable for the manufacturing industry leaders to consider prioritizing the implementation of these two building blocks as a crucial part of their transformation journey. Digitalization (DIPS) coupled with real-time data access through e-gadgets has the potential to significantly improve decision-making, operational efficiency, and innovations in the manufacturing supply chain (Song et al., 2023 ; Sharma et al., 2023 ). The layered manufacturing process of AMFG with negligible material waste has made a favorable impact on virgin material extraction from the earth, improved responsiveness to customers, and lowered carbon footprints (Godina et al., 2020 ). This is theoretically and intuitively true too. Therefore, quicker adoption of these two technologies in manufacturing can possibly influence the SDGs. Furthermore, three building blocks- BDAN, CCOM, and AIML in Table 7  have also shown high enough weights (value > 0.1) in relation to the SDGs. Hence, the next group for prioritization can be these three I4.0 blocks. Table 8   shows the results from the model synthesis. It shows the normalized priority weights of all I4.0 blocks, combined together, with respect to all SDGs. The final AHP outcome, after synthetization, shown in Table 8  has indicated that four dominant building blocks – DIPS, AMFG, BDAN, and CCOM have a significant influence on the manufacturing sustainability goal (macro level). Together, they have a significant weight of 68%. The research paper by Kurniawan et al. (2022) , has distinctly indicated the growing importance of digital technologies which is in line with the results obtained in this analysis. This is possible because by streamlining production procedures, cutting waste, and increasing resource efficiency, AI technologies like DIPS (Digital Industrial Platform Solutions), AMFG (Additive Manufacturing Workflow Software), BDAN (Big Data Analytics for Manufacturing), and CCOM (Cognitive Computing in Manufacturing) have a significant impact on manufacturing sustainability. They improve supply chain management, predictive maintenance, and decision-making, which eventually results in cost savings and a smaller environmental impact, in line with the objectives of sustainable manufacturing. Clearly, the focus of manufacturing leaders, policymakers, and researchers can be on the implementation of these four I4.0 building blocks. Besides, the outcomes of the synthesized model also indicate that two building blocks of I4.0 – CPSY and IIOT have a low influence on attaining the SDGs. Due to issues like high implementation costs, restricted accessibility in some areas, and potential environmental issues with their deployment, AI technologies like CPSY (Cognitive Process and Systems Integration) and IIOT (Industrial Internet of Things) may have less of an impact on the SDGs. Furthermore, their widespread use and potential impact on sustainable development goals may be hampered by the requirement for specialized knowledge and worries about data privacy. However, these technologies indirectly facilitate efficiency, scalability, and growth of the other building blocks. It's critical to approach the deployment of CPSY, IIOT, and comparable technologies strategically, considering the unique context and difficulties associated with each SDG, while also addressing potential barriers and ensuring responsible and inclusive implementation. The weights of I4.0 building blocks can be used for developing a simple, effective, and meaningful metric named the Technology Driven Sustainability Index (TDSI). 5.1 Technology Driven Sustainability Index (TDSI) The results of AHP can be utilized for evaluating the sustainability indices of an organization in Industry 4.0 technologies adoption. Considering the application, it is named as Technology Driven Sustainability Index (TDSI). To compute the sustainability indices following steps shall be followed.1. Self-evaluation of the organization by rating the sustainability level achieved in the eight I4.0 building blocks adoption on a scale of 1–5 (1 being the lowest scale and 5 the highest).  2. The total score will be calculated by using the following formula:    Technology-Driven Sustainability Indices Wi equation 1 = ∑ i = 1  n  ( W i  .  r i   )   x  100      n = number of I4.0 technologies, i = 1to 8. Wi  = relative weight of each I4.0 technology (derived with AHP). ri  = response on a scale of 1–5 for ith building block.3. Wi  i.e., the relative weight of each I4.0 technology which is derived with AHP shows the importance of a specific I4.0 technology. This weight is multiplied by the degree of sustainability (1–5 scale) attained for the respective I4.0 T. Thereafter, the sum of the product of all individual I4.0 technology weight with the response score by the sustainability stakeholders is computed, which represents the overall Technology-driven sustainability index of the industry. The value so arrived, signifies the equivalent technology-driven sustainability impact of the manufacturing company.  4. Interpretation of the score can be done as per the guidelines in Table 9   to plan further actions.    The application of TDSI by industry practitioners can be in assessing the status and also in tracking the trend of sustainability improvement in the I4.0 transformation journey of a manufacturing setup. A periodic assessment of the metric can facilitate sustainability-related decision-making and provide the right focus by the top management in the I4.0 transformation journey. This index can also facilitate in designing schemes by policymakers.   6 Limitations and future scope This research work is very topical as it addresses only certain aspects of sustainability in manufacturing, such as the consumption of resources, the environmental impact of technology adoption, and the benefits of Industry 4.0 technologies. This brings out the need for further research in other clusters of manufacturing. The weights obtained for the building blocks of I4.0 in achieving the SDGs are based on the ongoing I4.0 transformation of the manufacturing industries perceived by academia and industry experts. Significant implementation of I4.0 in most parts of the world is still to be witnessed. Further, the study can also be extended keeping Industry 5.0 characteristics with greater collaboration between humans and machines as the technology-driven I4.0 cannot be human-less. Besides, the two methodologies adopted in this research, i.e., AHP and ISM involve subjectivity and complexity that might lead to data sensitivity and inconsistent results. Future studies can explore the integration of AI for improved data processing and reduced subjectivity. Therefore, a real-time smart manufacturing industry case study can serve as a validation methodology for the model. Also, the application of AHP in real-time decision-making, such as on the Internet of Things and dynamic environments is also recommended in future studies.  7 Research implications The research has enriched the literature in terms of the impact of I4.0 on manufacturing sustainability which is a critical subject for industry leaders and policymakers today. The structured research framework and useful insights which are based on the AHP methodology and realistic inputs from experienced academic and industry practitioners have provided a robust theoretical foundation. This research is among the few offering the relation of Industry 4.0 building blocks with United Nations SDGs. Besides, the Legitimacy theory has been applied for the conceptualization of the paper, which is unique in the present literature. Additionally, the research has identified important technologies like DIPS, SMFG, BDAN, and CCOM as key technologies for achieving sustainable manufacturing in the technologically advanced period. These technologies have the potential to increase productivity, accommodate environmental concerns, and spur innovation, which makes them crucial tools for firms to connect their production methods with sustainability goals. The contribution of the research in developing a simple by effective sustainability metric – TDSI has significant practical application to measure and track the impact of the I4.0 transformation journey. The insights from the analyses and the applicability of the sustainability impact metric are useful directional points for manufacturing industry leaders and policymakers to consider in their decision-making and policy design processes, respectively. They are likely to make better-informed decisions that advance sustainability and digital transformation in the industry by taking these findings into account. The capacity to prioritize projects that support technological developments and environmental and social sustainability is expected to be encouraged in the industrial development journey.  8 Conclusions With the rapid intervention of Information and communication technology in the manufacturing industries and growing concern for sustainability understanding the influence of I4.0 building blocks towards sustainability using the SDGs has become imperative for industry practitioners. The research has culled out the interrelationship details between I4.0 and SDGs from an extant literature review, and interaction with focus group members. The Interpretive Structural modelling (ISM) approach was applied to identify the key driving SDGs in manufacturing. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), thereafter, was applied using the Super-Decisions software to understand the relationships between the I4.0 technologies (I4.0T) and the SDGs. It has highlighted the priorities (weights) of the I4.0 building blocks. The outcomes from these have significantly facilitated the industry leaders and policymakers in the decision-making process of building a sustainable business world for tomorrow. Digitalization of processes and systems, Additive manufacturing, Big data analytics, and Cloud computing are the top four critical I4.0 building blocks for facilitating sustainability in manufacturing. This research, thereby, has provided some useful insights to industry leaders, policymakers, and researchers. Another significant contribution of the research study to the industry practitioners has been in providing a simple-to-compute but effective metric, referred to as the ‘Technology Driven Sustainability Index’. This can facilitate measuring and tracking the progress of sustainability impact in reference to SDGs in the I4.0 transformation journey of an industry. The current research has been carried out with a specific cluster of manufacturing industries, which is a limitation. This paves the way for further research on the impact of I4.0 in other manufacturing clusters to enhance SDGs-based sustainability in manufacturing.
