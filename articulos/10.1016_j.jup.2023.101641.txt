Table 1   Cultural Controls Cultural controls refer to using organizational values, clans, and symbols to shape employees' behavior. They focus on establishing a shared culture and ethical standards within the organization to guide decision-making and actions.  Planning Planning involves the process of setting organizational goals. A distinction is made between long-range planning and action planning. It includes defining objectives, allocating resources, or formulating action plans.  Cybernetic Controls Cybernetic controls include budgets, financial and non-financial measurement systems, and hybrid measurement systems. They use performance measurement systems and metrics to compare actual results with the desired. Where deviations are identified, corrective actions are taken to bring performance back on track.  Reward and Compensation Reward and compensation systems are designed to motivate employees by providing rewards for reaching desired outcomes.  Administrative Controls Administrative controls include governance and organizational structures as well as policies and procedures. They refer to the use of rules and hierarchical authority to control activities.     Table 2 Overview of municipal utilities.

Keywords Content analysis  Management control  Municipal utilities  Sustainable development goals  Sustainable value   Data availability Content analysis of public available reports   1 Motivation and research question Although reporting on the contribution of public sector organizations (PSOs) to sustainable development (SD) has increased over recent decades, and the topic has thus increasingly found its way into academic discourse as well (e.g., Imperiale et al., 2023 ; Valenza and Damiano, 2023 ; Ligorio et al., 2022 ; Nicolò et al., 2021 ; Manes- Rossi et al., 2020 ; Traxler and Greiling, 2018 ), knowledge of how PSOs are managing or controlling their sustainability performance to create sustainable value (SV) remains very limited. Although no uniform definition of SV can be identified in the literature to date, many approaches to SV agree that it is a holistic concept that considers value in all dimensions of SD and thus the interests of a variety of stakeholders (e.g., Bocken et al., 2015 ; Hart and Milstein, 2003 ). In this vein, it can be understood as organizational contributions to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In 2015, all United Nations (UN) member states committed to the 2030 Agenda and, thus, the 17 SDGs (United Nations, 2015 ). The SDGs are considerably more challenging than the Millennium Goals since they require a commitment from developed and developing countries (Sachs, 2012 ). The European Union's political program has put the SDGs at the heart of the Commission's policymaking, proposals, policies, and strategies and embraces the entirety of government approaches (European Commission, 2020 ). On the nation-state level, the overall responsibility for implementing the SDGs lies on the federal level, but implementing the SDGs calls for a multi-governance approach within each country. The focus countries of our study, Austria and Germany, have three-tier governments: the federal state, regional states, and local governments. Much more than in prior UN Agendas, Agenda 2030 pursues a partnership approach. Adequate reporting is also needed to evaluate implementation progress. Thus, it is hardly surprising that reporting on SDGs is becoming increasingly relevant at the level of individual organizations. A recent KPMG (2022)  study, based on a sample of companies from more than 50 countries, shows that voluntary SDG reporting has increased substantially. However, the KPMG study (2022) and academic scholars showed that there is still room for improvement in reporting (e.g., Bose and Kahn, 2022 ; Pizzi et al., 2021 ). While the SDG reporting of large companies is gaining momentum in practice and academic discourse, much less is known about the implemented measures regarding the SDGs of PSOs (e.g., Kuswantoro et al., 2022 ; Nicolò et al., 2020 ). Although reporting can contribute significantly to PSOs from a public accountability or legitimacy perspective, reporting that is not followed by adequate measures to manage or enhance SV is insufficient (Lueg and Radlach, 2016 ; Maas et al., 2016 ). In addition, appropriate control instruments or mechanisms, which bring the level of talk and the level of action closer together by helping to increase the SV created, are needed (Schaltegger et al., 2022 ; Traxler et al., 2020 ; Lueg and Radlach, 2016 ). While there is a growing body of literature on sustainability management control practices (e.g., Schaltegger et al., 2022 ; Crutzen et al., 2017 ; Lueg and Radlach, 2016 ), PSOs in general and in the public sector, municipal utilities (MUs) in particular, have not received sufficient attention to date. The limited literature is surprising given that MUs play a crucial role in SD and achieving the SDGs. They provide services essential to the transformation toward a sustainable economy and society. In providing their services, they are much closer to citizens than regional and national PSOs. This is particularly interesting from a stewardship perspective, as the mission of MUs is focused on local public interests, which sometimes differ significantly from regional and national ones. Against this background, the paper addresses the following research question.RQ How do Austrian and German municipal utilities manage and control their sustainable value?   The remaining parts of the paper are organized as follows. Section 2 , Conceptual and Theoretical Background,  provides an overview of the concepts used and develops a theoretical perspective for our study. Section 3 , Methodology and Sample,  describes the sample and the methodology applied before presenting the results of our study in section 4 , Results . This is followed by a discussion and conclusions in section 5 Discussion and Conclusions .  2 Conceptual and Theoretical Background The literature on management control proposes several distinct approaches to systematization that attempt to show the different control practices organizations can use (e.g., Merchant and Van der Stede, 2017 ; Malmi and Brown, 2008 ; Simons, 1995 ). Malmi and Brown (2008)  follow a holistic view, distinguishing between cultural controls, planning, cybernetic controls, reward and compensation, and administrative controls (see Table 1  ). Their management control system (MCS) view encompasses formal and informal controls as well as institutional and procedural elements, thus consolidating other MCS approaches. Consequently, it can be considered one of the most comprehensive MCS understandings to date (Guenther et al., 2016 ). In their systematic literature review, Lueg and Radlach (2016)  highlighted the different possibilities within the control types, according to Malmi and Brown (2008) , that organizations can use to manage their SV. Within the control options via organizational culture, they distinguish between control based on values and control intended to trigger intrinsic motivation and aspiration of the employees. Within planning, a distinction is made between strategic and action planning, whereas no further differentiation is made in the control type reward and compensation. The greatest differentiation, however, is found in the cybernetic and administrative control types, with a distinction being made within cybernetic control between corporate performance management, reporting, balanced scorecard, accounting, individual performance management, and budgeting. In the case of administrative control options, the authors mention leadership, management, and structure, as well as policies, guidelines, and codes of conduct. In addition, the following are also mentioned: communication, discussion, feedback, engaging and empowering employees, vision and mission statement, cross-functional teams, and resource allocation (Lueg and Radlach, 2016 ). Regarding the motivations that might move MUs to implement control practices to manage their SV, it can be argued that MUs that provide a range of services of general interest (e.g., water supply, energy supply, public transport) directly to citizens as customers are under particularly high pressure of legitimation and faced with various signaling needs, since they must serve not only the market logic but also the state logic (Argento et al., 2019 ; Saz-Carranza and Longo, 2012 ). However, from the perspective of strategic stakeholder agency, to ensure ongoing success, MUs should address sustainability issues deemed important by strategically relevant stakeholders with appropriate management control practices and communicate this to them in an appropriate manner (Garcia et al., 2016 ; Özsözgün Caliskan, 2014 ; Freeman, 2010 ; Freeman et al., 2004 ; Donaldson and Preston, 1995 ; Hill and Jones, 1992 ). Regarding the design of a sustainability management control system (SMCS), this means that a selection is made and that only those control instruments or mechanisms are implemented that are necessary to manage the concerns of the strategically relevant stakeholders. However, limiting the SMCS to the requirements of the strategic stakeholders also limits the SV created since contributions to the achievement of the SDGs are only made in individual areas and not in all potential ones. To move beyond the selective approach suggested by the strategic stakeholder agency perspective, MUs would need to improve their stakeholder engagement processes on SDG implementation. So far, stakeholder engagement processes that lead to materiality matrices required for non-financial reports are often criticized for being far from a holistic stakeholder engagement. How companies should collect essential stakeholders’ interests concerning the SDGs has not yet been established. From a theoretical point of view, a more holistic SMCS design could be argued for MUs building on stewardship theory. In line with Voorn et al. (2017) , MUs are examples of the local dimension of hybrid companies. Stewardship theory builds on PSOs' community logic and public value orientation (Greiling and Spraul, 2010 ). It proposes that managers act not individually and self-interestedly but collectively and prosocial (Davis et al., 1997 ). Regarding the organizational behavior perspective for SV creation, stewardship theory suggests that SDG issues are not only selectively reflected in the SMCSs after weighing their strategic relevance. Instead, a more holistic view is taken, considering all possible issues in which a contribution can be made to SD (Farneti and Dumay, 2014 ; Swilling, 2010 ). Such a collective, prosocial approach is essential for MUs that take their public mission and social mandate seriously. Although such MUs must also serve the market logic, the community logic must not be neglected. It is expected that a SMCS will be implemented that considers this holistic SV view in meeting this requirement.  3 Methodology and sample The most recent sustainability reporting of 21 Austrian and German MUs was examined utilizing a content analysis to gain initial empirical insights into which control instruments or mechanisms MUs use to manage their SV. A joint study of the two countries regarding this question is obvious for several reasons. In Austria and Germany, MUs in this form exist nationwide, whereas, in other European Union (EU) countries, such as Belgium or France, they are found only in specific regions. In addition, the institutional frameworks of the two countries are very similar in governance structures, legal systems, and regulatory environment. Accordingly, this research focuses on Austrian and German MUs. As the first step, Austrian cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants and German cities with more than 200,000 inhabitants were identified. As the second step, all MUs of these cities that report on sustainability and refer to the SDGs in the report or on the website were selected. The sample did not include MUs that did not refer to the SDGs in the report or on their website. Hence, the selected MUs can be considered pioneers in this field, at least regarding SDG reporting. Although there are no legal obligations to do so, they already refer to the SDGs as part of their disclosure practices. Table 2   provides an overview of the MUs included. Subsequently, the reporting of these MUs was subjected to content analysis, systematically analyzing the reporting content to obtain information about which control practices are being used. The content analysis of the sustainability reports was carried out using both a deductive and an inductive approach. The MCS package by Malmi and Brown (2008)  was used for the deductive analysis. That is, all textual information regarding the use of the different control types disclosed within the reporting was assigned to the specific categories of the framework. This approach follows Lueg and Radlach (2016) , who also applied this framework in their systematic literature review to develop the categories or clusters for the analysis. In the second step of the analysis, subcategories were developed inductively from the text material of each control type.  4 Results 4.1 Cultural control 4.1.1 Vision, mission, and corporate policies Specific reference to the SDGs is anchored in the mission of only one MU (14). More frequently, the topic of sustainability or SD, in general, is anchored in the vision (1; 7; 8; 9; 10; 13; 16; 17; 20; 21) and mission (1; 7; 8; 12; 14; 15; 16; 18; 20; 21), for example “[…] it remains a continuous management task to always keep the individual target categories in economic, ecological and social balance with each other.”  (1). In addition to vision and mission, the contribution to SD is also a topic within the statutes (7; 17). Through the vision and the mission, the MUs try to convey all values and attitudes, and thus also those related to sustainability. Furthermore, the mission statement provides the basis for all actions in the company and explicitly expresses what the MUs are pursuing (1; 2; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 14). One MU points out that its mission statement has shown considerable continuity over the years (1). The mission statement of another MU refers to a traditional understanding of its role on the path to SD, the principle of the “honorable merchant”  (5). Several MUs adopted a corporate governance code that describes the essential principles for management and supervision, considering internationally and nationally recognized standards (4; 6; 8; 10; 16). The codes of conduct also refer to laws, principles and standards that are essential for SD (1; 4; 7; 8; 16; 19). One MU emphasizes that its code of conduct is constantly revised to raise awareness and train employees in responsible behavior (17).  4.1.2 Values and attitudes Within the vision and mission, central values and attitudes are defined that should fundamentally shape the behavior of the employees and lay the foundation for the organizational culture (11; 17; 20). As expressed by one report, “[o]ur shared values form the basis for an open corporate culture […]”  (9). The values and attitudes are not specifically linked to the SDGs but generally support SD. Values or attitudes such as a sense of community (2; 4; 6; 8; 14; 19; 21), responsibility (2; 11; 14; 20), environmental responsibility (2; 5; 6; 8; 10; 11; 14; 21), social responsibility (1; 2; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 10; 11; 21), diversity, and equality (1; 4; 9; 10; 11; 14), transparency (6; 11; 14; 16), fairness (4; 5; 6; 14; 19) as well as appreciation (6; 11; 15; 16; 21) are frequently mentioned. In addition, responsible leadership (1; 2; 11; 14; 15) and sustainable leadership (6; 8; 9; 11) are mentioned. Explicit references are often also made to the economic efficiency of service delivery (2; 5; 6; 8; 10).   4.2 Planning 4.2.1 Strategic planning Topics with links to sustainability are considered within strategic planning. Many MUs have established an explicit sustainability strategy to promote SD (1; 2; 5; 7; 8; 9; 11; 13; 14; 15; 16; 18; 19). A major goal within strategic planning, addressed in many respects, is decarbonization, as expressed by one MU: “As an innovative and future-oriented company, we aim to become completely climate-neutral, and even CO 2  -negative in the long term. For us, climate neutrality is not an end but our entrepreneurial response to these challenges.”  (21). Many MUs are documenting their path toward climate neutrality, although the time perspectives vary. While some MUs state 2030 (1; 6; 8; 13; 17), others want to reach this target by 2040 (14; 18), 2045 (5; 21) or 2050 (4). However, they mention not only when this goal should be reached but also present different approaches to reaching this goal, such as complete energy self-sufficiency (2; 14). To this end, many MUs strive to expand renewable energies (4; 5; 8; 11; 16). In any case, it will take a significant CO2  reduction over the next few years, which many MUs explicitly state (1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 8; 9; 11; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 21). As one report expressed, “[t]he goal is to save up to 150,000 t of CO 2  per year […]”  (14). One MU also specifies interim goals for this path: “Interim targets are to reduce CO 2  by 65% by 2030 and 88% by 2040”  (5). In addition to decarbonization, a further strategic goal concerns the duty of MUs to safeguard services of general interest for generations to come (1; 2; 14; 15; 19). Additionally, as part of their long-term staffing policy, the aim is to retain employees in the utilities for as long as possible and enable them to contribute their expertise efficiently (2; 8). Furthermore, the proportion of employees with disabilities should be further increased in the coming years (19). Many MUs also want to increase the proportion of women in leadership positions (5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 13; 16; 19), which is expressed, for example, as follows: “Another focus is on increasing the proportion of female managers as part of our 2019–2024 women's advancement plan, in which we aim to specifically increase the proportion of women in areas where women are currently underrepresented”  (10). In strategic planning, many MUs express their commitment to achieving the SDGs in general and regarding particular SDGs (4; 5; 6; 8; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18; 19; 20). However, the coverage of the SDGs is unbalanced. Thereby, the most frequently mentioned SDGs are SDG 7, “Affordable and Clean Energy”  (15 MUs), 11 “Sustainable Cities and Communities”  (14 MUs), 13 “Climate Action”  (14 MUs), 12 “Responsible Consumption and Production”  (12 MUs), 9 “Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure”  (12 MUs), 6 “Clean Water and Sanitation”  (12 MUs), and 8 “Decent Work and Economic Growth”  (11 MUs). The remaining 10 SDGs were mentioned in the reports of fewer than 10 MUs or, in the case of SDG 2, “Zero Hunger,”  by none.  4.2.2 Action planning In addition to strategic planning, SD issues are also considered in action planning. Action goals refer to the implementation of workshops on “Urban gardening”, “Flowering meadow”  or workshops for new trainees on the topic of sustainability (9). The introduction of a CO2  road map (6) and a greenhouse gas balance (8) are also mentioned as short-term goals. Another short-term goal is also defined in employment regarding the ability to employ adequate personnel in sufficient numbers and in a timely manner to counteract or mitigate the shortage of skilled workers (11; 15; 20). As part of employer branding, new employees are to be attracted to the company through various initiatives (8; 19; 20).   4.3 Cybernetic controls 4.3.1 Management systems, certifications, and audits The MUs relied on systems to manage and enhance SD, as expressed by one report. “Our sustainability management system systematically records all measures that contribute to sustainability or social responsibility and specifies concrete targets, enabling progress in sustainability to be regularly reviewed, made demonstrable, and developed further”  (5). Generally, a management system describes how companies organize their complex structures and requirements to act systematically, ensure smooth operations, and achieve planned results. To ensure the system's effectiveness, it relies on structured and optimized processes and control mechanisms (7). Organizations use management systems for different areas, such as compliance (1; 7; 10; 19), quality (1; 8; 7; 11), environment (1; 2; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 10; 11; 19; 21), risk (4; 7; 8; 15; 16; 19; 20), occupational health and safety (1; 3; 5; 7; 8; 10; 11; 15; 16; 19), complaints (19), energy (2; 4; 8; 11), waste (5) and customer issues (20) to ensure compliance with regulatory and corporate requirements and improve SD. Through energy management, in addition to major programs such as decarbonizing district heating, many smaller efficiency measures are continuously planned, audited, and implemented (4). One MU, for example, reports on the successes achieved using an energy management system: “With the help of the energy management system, we were able to reduce the total energy consumption by 8.8% in 2021 compared with 2020”  (2). The MUs use certifications in some areas. For example, the ISO 50001 energy management system has been introduced and certified by some MUs (2; 4; 5; 8; 11; 15). Such a system systematizes all initiated activities and makes them measurable and transparent. It is reviewed annually and recertified every three years (2). Occupational safety management systems are certified in accordance with ISO 45001 (1; 8; 11). The ISO 9001-certified quality management system continuously supports and improves product and process quality (1; 7; 8; 11). Decarbonization targets were verified as compatible with the 1.5-degree target defined by the Science-Based Target Initiative in 2021. Furthermore, several utilities are certified following the environmental management systems ISO 14001 or EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme) (1; 4; 7; 8; 10; 11; 15; 19). Two MUs have also implemented and certified an information security management system in accordance with ISO/IEC 27001 to manage IT security (7; 11). Compliance and data protection audits and energy audits (DIN EN 16247) are carried out approximately once or twice a year to facilitate internal improvements (8). In addition, one MU has attained the audit certification “work and family”  (7).  4.3.2 Reporting Of the 21 MUs in our sample, 18 (1; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 18; 19; 20; 21) have published a separate sustainability report. The remaining three companies (2; 16; 17) have decided to integrate the information into their annual report. Ten of the 21 reports were prepared following the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines. In sustainability reporting, the issue of climate neutrality or greenhouse gas emissions takes up substantial space. Climate-relevant emissions are recorded utilizing a greenhouse gas balance or a carbon footprint (1; 4; 8; 9; 11; 13; 16; 17; 19) to create the information basis required for monitoring the goal achievements towards climate neutrality. According to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, the carbon footprint includes direct emissions (Scope 1) and energy-related emissions (Scope 2). The results “[…] were used to create a separate climate protection path until 2025. This covers the areas of mobility management, electricity procurement, operating materials, and employees, and includes preparations for the switch to e-vehicles”  (19). Additionally, a sustainability index was developed to increase the contribution to SD. This index comprises key figures from the central fields of action in sustainability. The goal is to increase this sustainability index continuously (16).   4.4 Reward and compensation The basic remuneration system is not yet linked to achieving sustainability targets or SD for employees. Rather, pay systems based on a collective agreement are common practice in the MUs (1; 2; 4; 5; 7; 8; 11; 15; 16; 19). Part-time employees receive the same additional benefits as their full-time counterparts, adjusted by a percentage based on their part-time factor (8). MUs are also committed to gender-neutral remuneration (1; 7; 10; 11). Remuneration is based on pay grades, work performance, the qualifications required for the job, and the employees’ experience (1; 7). Variable components have been agreed upon for some senior employees and the executive board, some of which are also linked to sustainability parameters or indicators (1; 7; 17). A leave of absence is granted to employees who volunteer in non-profit organizations such as the fire department (2). Additional company benefits also include supplementary health insurance (1; 16; 21), retirement provision (1; 5; 8; 11; 13; 16), sports and health offers (1; 11; 16; 20), as well as participation in seminars and training programs (4; 5; 10; 11; 15; 16; 17; 20; 21). Long-serving employees are seen as deserving of thanks and recognition. Accordingly, 25-, 40- and 50-year anniversaries are celebrated with employees. At such celebrations, they are honored by the executive board and receive a certificate, an anniversary bonus, and a day off (5). Other offers include part-time work for older employees and the opportunity to take additional leave in return for reduced pay (8). Benefits that promote climate protection include access to stationary bicycles or e-bikes, free use of city bikes (17), and subsidies for tickets for local public transport (17). In addition, electric charging stations have been set up where employees can charge their cars (3; 10; 11). Furthermore, through idea and innovation initiatives, MUs encourage employees to develop new product ideas, new services, or work processes, which can also improve sustainability performance (1; 8; 11; 13; 14; 16; 19). Innovative suggestions are rewarded (8; 11) as reported, for example, by one MU. “25 suggestions were  awarded within the scope of the company suggestion scheme in the business year 2021. The total  award payout was € 44,915.00 […]"  (8). "The occupational safety  award - a challenge cup and a travel voucher - was raffled off among the winning occupational safety suggestions for the fourth time in 2021”  (11). One MU plans to set up an idea platform explicitly for sustainability via the intranet (1).  4.5 Administrative controls 4.5.1 Organizational structures and responsibilities The MUs anchor the issue of sustainability studied at several hierarchical levels, as is strikingly disclosed by one of them: “We achieve our diverse objectives best through decentralized sustainability management. At the same time, we ensure central relevance by placing responsibility for sustainability with our management. Where appropriate, it delegates tasks to experts, for example in energy or environmental management. Group officers oversee our strategic alignment with regard to energy consumption, emissions, and other environmental issues; the divisions then implement them […]”  (7). The concrete designations, responsibilities, and tasks vary between the individual MUs. Many MUs have officers or managers responsible for sustainability and/or environment (1; 5; 7; 8; 9; 10; 14; 16; 17; 18; 19). In addition, officers are appointed for specific topics such as compliance (1; 2; 5; 6; 8; 10; 15; 19; 21), data protection (1; 5), risk management (5; 20), waste (5), water protection (1; 5) and energy efficiency (5; 8; 9). Moreover, various staff units and teams are being developed to promote SD. While MUs established staff units for sustainability management (2; 3; 4; 9; 11; 15; 17), quality and environmental management (8), or occupational health and safety as well as corporate rules and compliance (8), others created working groups for the fields of water, emission, and incident protection or waste and hazardous substance management as well as climate change and climate neutrality (10; 16). One MU also set up a sustainability steering committee to coordinate operational measures (16). Another MU also established a sustainability board, which consists of the board and representatives of the division heads (21). At the top management level, sustainability management is often assigned directly to the entire management board or individual board members (2; 4; 8; 9; 16).  4.5.2 Policies, guidelines, and programs The policies, guidelines, and programs mainly refer to ethical principles, applicable regulations, and laws in general. To meet all legal requirements and to avoid corruption and misconduct, most MUs have adopted compliance guidelines (1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 15; 16; 17; 19; 21). Principles of conduct describe the essential rules for responsible action (2). In one MU, the code of conduct serves as a means of orientation for legally compliant, integrity-oriented, and responsible conduct; it is substantiated by many other regulations, such as company and service agreements and organizational or work instructions (1). Other guidelines relate to group directives (4; 7; 8; 9; 13; 15; 16; 19), competence regulations (8), representation directives (8), company agreements (1; 7; 8), rules of procedure (5; 7; 8; 19; 20), business allocation plans (8), the directive on the resolution and organization of management (8) as well as directives for financial transactions and investment management (8). In the context of SD, sustainable supplier management is increasingly focused on by the MUs (4; 5; 9; 15; 16). Three MUs have an explicit supplier code (3; 8; 15). “With our Supplier Code, we specify the minimum requirements for human rights, labor practices, climate and environmental protection, and ethical business practices to be observed by all contractors as well as their subcontractors”  (15). As part of the supplier management system, all suppliers must provide information on whether they have compliance or anti-corruption regulations and a code of conduct and whether they are committed to the UN Global Compact (3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 10; 11; 15).“We require our suppliers and other external business partners to recognize or meet certain ethical, environmental and social standards that are consistent with our understanding”  (5).  4.5.3 Communication and empowering employees Values are not merely written down. Through active communication, MUs try to communicate their values (1; 6; 11; 14; 17; 19). “Our corporate values are not meant for paper. They are meant to be lived - whether in the office, on the canal network, or while working from home. Our managers act as a link between the management, our employees, and partners and make our values and guidelines tangible in their daily actions. But only those who talk about and discuss their corporate values can keep them alive. That's why we maintain an open dialog and continuously develop our corporate culture and values.”  (6). Moreover, the values are disseminated throughout the MUs through various workshops where employees from all company areas can participate (9; 11; 15; 16). MUs also provide company-wide training on compliance basics. The training raises awareness of pitfalls in everyday life and can thus help protect both employees and the company (3; 4; 6; 10; 11; 15; 19). By communicating and transporting the values, all employees should be encouraged to include the idea of sustainability in their decisions. They should also be encouraged to adopt a sustainable attitude and thus act for the benefit of people and the environment. The aim is to mobilize employees and use their valuable knowledge and ideas for sustainable action (14). One MU emphasizes that, under the guidance of the defined attitudes, employees contribute to achieving the goals and continuously develop new contributions from their area of responsibility (5).    5 Discussion and conclusions Regarding our research question – How do Austrian and German municipal utilities manage and control their sustainable value? –  the findings of our study reveal that the investigated MUs have not only started to report the SV they create but have already acted beyond the talk level. As part of their sustainability or SDG reporting, these companies also provide information on how they manage it or try to increase it. To control their SV, a wide range of different control instruments or mechanisms are used, which can be assigned to different control types, according to Malmi and Brown (2008) . Table 3   shows how the control practices used by the investigated MUs can be assigned to the package. In some cases, the package thinking of the MCS literature is taken up by using different approaches to controlling (Malmi and Brown, 2008 ). For example, values relating to sustainability are not only written down in the vision or mission statements to create an organizational culture in which sustainability is given a specific space as a foundation of control but an attempt is also made to convey them utilizing corresponding administrative measures. Moreover, our study shows that control instruments or mechanisms in use at MUs draw on different types of control and already consider environmental, social, and economic aspects of SD and, thus, a range of SDGs. In addition, a link between the strategic and operational levels has already been established in some cases. For example, many of the MUs studied stated that they intend to achieve climate neutrality in the coming years or decades. The reduction of CO2  is not only postulated as a strategic goal but individual steps on this path or actions are also planned. Thus, strategic and operational planning are combined, and different types of control provided that the achievement of the planned values is closely monitored and appropriate measures are taken in case of deviations. Commitment to the 17 SDGs should also be emphasized in the MU strategic planning context. More than half of the MUs studied refer to SDGs in their reporting or link activities to them. However, the consideration of the individual SDGs is unbalanced. SDG 7, “Affordable and Clean Energy,”  11, “Sustainable Cities and Communities,”  and 13, “Climate Action,”  are considered particularly frequently. Even though, from a holistic perspective, it would be desirable to address all SDGs to which a contribution can be made in principle, such focus within the SDGs is obvious, given the underlying business areas and the associated impact on SD. Our findings show that cybernetic controls are also very often implemented. The vast majority of MUs have published separate sustainability reports. Management systems focusing on compliance, environment, risk, and occupational health and safety are frequently used. Particular attention is paid to the ISO 50001 energy management system and the ISO 14001 and EMAS environmental management systems, which are also certified. With the help of certifications, the companies send a signal, which in turn may increase their reputation. The area of compliance is represented not only in cybernetic controls. In administrative controls, compliance guidelines are often used in conjunction with training programs. More than half of the studied MUs have adopted compliance guidelines. In addition, a compliance officer responsible for this topic is often appointed in this context. In general, the results show that the MUs have, in many cases, taken structural measures to define responsibilities regarding sustainability and institutionalize the topic. Furthermore, the findings of our study show that sustainability issues are not only considered in the organizational culture, planning process, cybernetic systems, or administrative structures but that a steering effect is also to be achieved through incentives. However, the setting of incentives for promoting sustainable behavior plays a subordinate role compared to other types of controls, even though our research found some incentives. Although our analysis of the reports revealed that various management control instruments or mechanisms that address different SDGs are already in use, a closer look shows that these focus particularly on the strategically relevant issues or the issues that are important for the market logic, especially for tangible goals. From a theoretical perspective, this suggests that the MUs studied are not fully utilizing the potential that holistic engagement with the SDGs offers to position themselves as local stewards (Greiling and Spraul, 2010 ; Davis et al., 1997 ). In contrast, the findings indicate that the interests of the strategically most relevant stakeholders are currently being prioritized in the control practices as suggested from a strategic stakeholder agency perspective (Freeman, 2010 ; Freeman et al., 2004 ; Donaldson and Preston, 1995 ; Hill and Jones, 1992 ). In this context, however, it must also be mentioned that these are often the topics or SDGs where the MUs have special leverage due to their activities. Because of this, the SV created by MUs is limited. To move beyond this limited view, MUs must expand their stakeholder engagement processes to identify sustainability aspects that make sense not only from a strategic stakeholder perspective but also from the legitimate demands of other stakeholders. Thus, the community logic is considered in addition to the market logic, and the MUs meet their public value orientation. In such an understanding of their role, MUs act as locally embedded stewards, broadening their focus on where societal value can be added. Regarding the SDGs, this leads to a more holistic consideration, extending beyond the goals necessary to satisfy the strategically relevant stakeholders. In summary, the MUs studied have recognized that mere reporting is insufficient. In order to move beyond reporting, it is necessary to embed or adequately address the issue of SDGs in existing MCSs by implementing appropriate control instruments or mechanisms. Although our study showed that MUs have already begun to do so, there is still room for improvement, especially regarding a holistic consideration of the SDGs. From a managerial or practical point of view, broadening the perspective and thus taking a holistic view of the SDGs increases SV and, consequently, helps MUs position themselves as stewards in the local community, which can result in numerous benefits. From a political or societal perspective, assuming a pioneering role in this context can trigger a certain role model function, generating multiplier effects that extend far beyond the scope of MUs’ activities. From a theoretical perspective, the results show that theories that identify rational or commercial motives as drivers, or suggest a dominance of the market logic regarding integrating the SDGs into MCSs, can describe the observed behavior better than those based on normative or moral considerations. Like any study, ours has specific limitations. The main limitations are due to the methodology used, the content analysis of reports, and the sample selection. Future studies could use interviews to investigate whether there are other control practices that MUs do not report on but have in place. In addition, interviews might help to gain a more in-depth understanding of the reported control approaches and help to clarify motives.   Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
