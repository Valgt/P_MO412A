                  The United Nations set “The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,” which includes the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a collection of 17 global goals designed to be a “blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all”. Although only mentioned in one of the seventeen goals (goal 3), we argue that drugs in general, and growing drug pollution in particular, affects the SDGs in deeper, not readily apparent ways. So far, the emerging problem of drug pollution has not been sufficiently addressed. Here, we outline and discuss how drug pollution can affect SDGs and even threaten their achievement.

Although only mentioned in one of the seventeen goals (goal 3), we argue that drugs in general, and growing drug pollution in particular, affects the SDGs in deeper, not readily apparent ways. So far, the emerging problem of drug pollution has not been sufficiently addressed. Here, we outline and discuss how drug pollution can affect SDGs and even threaten their achievement.   Graphical abstract Unlabelled Image       Keywords Sustainable development goals  Drug pollution  Water-reuse  Eco-pharmacovigilance  Pharmaceuticals in the environment    After the devastating consequences of World War II, The United Nations was created to maintain international peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations and achieve international cooperation. Seventy years later, in 2015, this organization set “The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,” which includes the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a collection of 17 global goals designed to be a “blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all ” (United Nations (UN), 2015 ). Only five years after setting the SDGs, the world is suffering from a devastating pandemic caused by a zoonotic coronavirus, the third in the last two decades (Banerjee et al., 2019 ), highlighting the importance of the interconnection between people, biodiversity, and our shared environment in the Anthropocene. But while multiple contributions have focused on biodiversity and ecosystem services, we want to highlight a critical link between human and animal health and the environment: the one mediated by drugs. Higher frequency of pandemic events due to reduced biodiversity is expected in the immediate future (Austin, 2021 ). While the COVID–19 pandemic has been construed by many as a “One Health” problem, highlighting the need to promote health across all biodiversity (Bonilla-Aldana et al., 2020 ; Letko et al., 2020 ), few have considered emerging risks from widespread chemical pollution. Some authors have argued that pollution, with growing diversity and quantity of synthetic chemicals, has so far been an underestimated factor for global change (Bernhardt et al., 2017 ). Although great efforts are underway to curb some contaminants, such as persistent organic pollutants (Fiedler et al., 2019 ), pollution by pharmaceuticals has been identified as one of the main hazards for ecosystems. However, restricting the use of pharmaceuticals is difficult since pharmaceutical use has brought undeniable benefits to human health and life expectancy. In fact, the strategic approach set by the European commission states that “actions to address the environmental risk do not jeopardise access to safe and effective pharmaceutical treatments for human patients and animals ” (European Commission 2019 ). Although the challenge of pharmaceutical pollution is probably greater in lower-middle income countries (LMIC), there has been less concern about environmental impact of drugs in those settings (Fekadu et al., 2019 ). Data on pharmaceutical environmental loading from consumption and manufacture in those countries is scarce (Lees et al., 2016 ), and regulation regarding environmental issues of drugs is often lacking (Lees et al., 2016 ; Nature Editorial, 2015 ). Although only mentioned in one of the seventeen goals (goal 3), we argue that drugs, and growing drug pollution in particular, may affect SDGs in deeper, not readily apparent ways. So far, the emerging problem of drug pollution has not been sufficiently addressed. Here, we outline and discuss how drug pollution can affect SDGs and even threaten their achievement. 1 Goal 2: zero hunger Agriculture, including aquaculture, supplies most of the food required by the increasing world's population to survive. Hence, bacterial diseases affecting crops can create food shortages, resulting in malnutrition, and even famine. But years of antibiotic use in the prevention and treatment of these infections in humans and farm animals have contributed to the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria (Sieiro et al., 2020 ), with even treated wastewater becoming a source of both antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistant genes, which could be horizontally transferred to new microorganisms (Ju et al., 2019 ; Pazda et al., 2019 ). Considering water's importance, it is not surprising that a large fraction of global water withdrawals is used for agriculture (Land and Water Division, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 2005 ). Thanks to climate change, a shift towards irrigation for agricultural production is underway. If current irrigation distribution is maintained, some experts expect a decline in productivity in the next years because of reduced and erratic precipitation (Poustie et al., 2020 ). Changing precipitation patterns will increase the need to obtain water suitable for irrigation from wastewater treatment systems. Because of urban proximity (i.e., wastewater availability), decreasing and more variable precipitation, and an increasing need to boost food production as the global population grows, agricultural irrigation with wastewater will increase globally (Poustie et al., 2020 ). In LMIC, guidelines on the safe use of wastewater were introduced in the 1970s (Lees et al., 2016 ). As the concern regarding pharmaceuticals is recent, regulatory frameworks for controlling their loadings in soils and waters are still rare in LMIC (Lees et al., 2016 ). Even in high-income countries, relevant guidelines are only emerging now. On the 13th of May of 2020, The European Parliament approved the new law for reuse of reclaimed water. This new regulation defines minimum requirements for treated wastewater to be used safely for agricultural and other purposes (Regulation (EU), 2020 ). Wastewater reuse will enable limiting draws from water bodies and groundwater. Besides the potential for seeding antibiotic resistant bacteria, treated wastewater contains numerous substances, including many pharmaceuticals that may end up accumulating on different plant compartments (Poustie et al., 2020 ). Although current evidence does not show these cause apparent phytotoxicity, future changes in wastewater flow because of climate change or increasing use of pharmaceuticals may change this assessment (Poustie et al., 2020 ). We argue, however, that authors suffer from an “anthropocentric bias”, since they measure phytotoxicity as “growth inhibition and a decrease in yield productivity”. We still know little about the fate in the environment for most of the thousands of different pharmaceuticals in use. Although healthcare professionals might not reflect much about it, some drugs may have unexpected pharmacological effects on plants. For example, the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) participates in amino acid signaling across kingdoms, including plants (Ramesh et al., 2015 ). In humans, this pathway is modulated by benzodiazepines, a widely used class of pharmaceuticals released to the environment following wastewater treatment. Some studies have revealed these substances bioaccumulate and participate in plant metabolism, potentially analogous to the known metabolic transformation pathway of benzodiazepines in humans (Carter et al., 2018 ). This highlights the need for further assessment of the potential for biological activity of benzodiazepines (and other substances) following their plant uptake (Carter et al., 2018 ). There are indeed, many other potential examples as plants share many phylogenetically highly conserved signaling systems with animals (Iriti, 2013 ; Wessler et al., 2001 ; Lan et al., 2020 ). Critical gaps in our knowledge about the potential consequences of pharmaceuticals present in irrigation water in agriculture need to be addressed. While the recently approved European law does not currently set any concrete limits to the presence of any pharmaceutical in reclaimed water/wastewater, this might change in the future as new evidence emerges. Similarly, the current scientific literature suggests that application of biosolids to agricultural soils can be sustainable and economical based on recycling of nutrients from sewage sludge (Clarke and Cummins, 2014 ). However, and as with treated wastewater, it also has potential risks with respect to the occurrence of pharmaceuticals present in the sludge. Another issue of concern is the rise in the use of antimicrobials in livestock, which leads to the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria with dramatic public health implications. A study projected a 67% increase in antibiotics administered to livestock animals in feed worldwide by 2030 (from 2015 levels), with most of the increase in emerging economies (Boeckel et al., 2015 ). At the same time, aquaculture has developed rapidly and become an important pillar industry of economic development in some countries (Zhenxiang et al., 2016 ). In some instances, aquaculture production output even exceeds fishery catches. Products from China and Vietnam are exported to the USA, Japan and the EU area. But pharmaceuticals (especially antibiotics) are widely used in aquaculture, with the potential to cause serious pollution in coastal environments (Gaw et al., 2014 ).  2 Goal 3: good health and wellbeing Drugs have been indispensable to improve human health and wellbeing. In fact, in the last few decades, the WHO has promoted strategies like mass drug administration to control or eliminate many neglected tropical diseases that cause devastating consequences worldwide. This strategic approach, in which thousands or even millions of doses are administered simultaneously, has produced unquestionable benefits. However, the ecotoxicological aspects (in which drugs with proven ecological damage like ivermectin or azithromycin are used) of such programs and drug use may not have been sufficiently considered (Orive and Lertxundi, 2020 ). We believe the “One Health” approach should be applied to all drug classes, and not just antibiotics (Orive and Lertxundi, 2020 ). Antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria are matters of great concern and deserve all the attention they are given. Despite a current focus on zoonotic emerging diseases, growing antibiotic resistance is the world's main public health issue, threatening both gains in treating bacterial infections and the ability to conduct surgeries safely (World Health Assembly (WHA), 2015 ). But little is known about the consequences of antivirals on ecosystems, even as they are widely found in every environmental matrix (Nannou et al., 2020 ). The urgent need to treat patients infected with SARS-CoV2 has driven health care professionals to desperately administer drugs such as the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine, the antiviral lopinavir/ritonavir and the anti-parasitic ivermectin to patients suffering from COVID-19 (Palomar-Fernández and Álvarez-Díaz, 2020 ). Sadly, we have learned these are of little, if any benefit, to combat the disease, which has already caused more than a million of casualties (Lane et al., 2020 ; López-Medina et al., 2021 ). In some cases, like hydroxychloroquine, these drugs may have been deleterious to patients without any clear clinical benefit (Singh et al., 2021 ). In addition, in the heat of the battle, with some exceptions, the potential detrimental effects on the environment of these drugs have been generally ignored (Race et al., 2020 ; Tarazona et al., 2021 Mar ; Comber et al., 2020 ; Domingo-Echaburu et al., 2021a ). Crucially, when the environmental risk assessment (ERA) is presented by the manufacturer to healthcare authorities (EMA), off-label drug use (unapproved use of an approved drug) is not considered, even if it sometimes entails the main use of a certain product (Golocorbin Kon et al., 2015 ). The guideline states: “The Phase I decision tree concludes with the calculation of a Predicted Environmental Concentration in surface water (PECSW), based on the predicted use  of the product. When this PEC is ≥ the action limit of 0.01 μg/L, a Phase II assessment (section 4.2) ” (European Medicines Agency (EMA), 2018 ). In other words, to estimate PEC, the prevalence of the disease for which the drug is authorized is taken into account. Of course, such regulation does not account for pandemics! We believe these drug policy issues need to be updated in the near future (Wess, 2021 ). Besides, many of these drugs are “old”, so they lack a proper environmental risk assessment, as drug ERAs have been mandatory only since 2006. Drugs are present in every environmental matrix, including some drinking waters. A technical report carried out by the WHO published in 2012, stated that “Current observations suggest that it is very unlikely that exposure to very low levels of pharmaceuticals in drinking-water would result in appreciable adverse risks to human health ” (World Health Organization (WHO), 2012 ). Yet, drugs present in the environment could be a hazard for our health in more subtle and indirect ways. Potential effects of both chronic exposure and completely new mixtures of pollutants also remain unknown. Growing use of pharmaceuticals is projected with economic growth, ageing populations and advances in healthcare (The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2019 ), and we predict this will increase pharmaceutical water pollution. Therefore, societies will need to strengthen post-marketing surveillance mechanisms, also with regard to environmental effects, i.e., eco–pharmacovigilance (Jose et al., 2020 ).  3 Goal 4: quality education Organizations such as the Higher Education Sustainability Initiative (HESI) (Higher Education Sustainability Initiative (HESI), 2020 ), the recently created Global University Network for Innovations group of experts on SDGs and Higher Education (GUNI) (Global University Network for Innovation, 2020 ), and the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) (Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE), 2020 ) are initiatives that try to incorporate SDGs philosophy in universities. Although there is a vast literature concerning the presence of pharmaceuticals in the environment (Daughton, 2016 ), healthcare professionals prescribing, dispensing and administering drugs are likely unaware of the deleterious impacts these substances may have on wildlife. Schools of Medicine, Pharmacy, and Nursing around the world generally overlook drug's fate once excreted by patients (Lertxundi et al., 2020a ). The European commission, in its strategic approach to Pharmaceuticals in the Environment states that “how environmental aspects could become part of the medical training and professional development programs should be explored ” (European Commission 2019 ). We also believe quality education in the area of drug pollution is going to play a pivotal role in order to effectively fight the problem. We urgently need to incorporate aspects of drug pollution in biomedical, engineering and environmental graduations worldwide. We cannot afford health care professionals unaware of the impact of diclofenac in vultures, or the possible feminization of fish by endocrine disruptors like ethynylestradiol. Yet, a recent study carried examining physicians showed there is vast room for improvement. Of the 262 physicians surveyed, none considered environmental aspects when making prescription decisions (Wang et al., 2020 ).  4 Goal 6: clean water and sanitation Water is essential for life. As water is always present in the flux of pharmaceuticals in nature, it is also the environmental compartment where more drugs and residues are found. As a result, along with water scarcity and floods, water pollution is one of the main water-related challenges. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) do not eliminate all drugs, but the situation is even worse in many countries. SDGs have a special relevance in LMIC, where water is more polluted with drugs (Fekadu et al., 2019 ). Yet over 80% of the world's wastewater is released to the environment without adequate treatment (United Nations (UN), 2017 ). Improving access to basic sanitation will reduce open defecation and subsequently will decrease drug pollution by filtration, improving groundwater quality. Recycling water to cope with water shortages and promote circular economy is probably unavoidable, but water quality must be guaranteed. Therefore, the likely increase in use of wastewater in agriculture will bring new challenges, since accumulation of drugs in crops has been documented (Clarke and Cummins, 2014 ). Interpreting current legislation about drug pollution in Europe, which has been catalogued as the “front runner in eco-pharmacovigilancy”, can be a challenge for the non-experts (Wess, 2021 ). Ecotoxicological assessments based on bioaccumulation tests are essential for the determination of the environmental risk of chemical compounds as part of the European Commission's Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals programme (Consolidated Text: Regulation (EC) No, 2006 ). However, active pharmaceutical ingredients and excipients are subject to REACH but are exempt from registration, evaluation, and authorization if they are already registered with the European Medicines Agency (EMA, former EMEA) as an ingredient of a medicinal product for human or veterinary use. Since 2005, it's mandatory for the marketing authorization holders to send an ERA to EMA for the marketing authorization of o a new human medicine. However, environmental risk assessments for older drugs may not exist. The EMA is making efforts to update the ERAs of pharmaceuticals and the European Parliament considers environmental risks in the risk-benefit authorization of human pharmaceuticals are should be taken into account. Of course, in many other countries legislation is still more relaxed or directly non-existent (Wess, 2021 ). In Europe, the surface water “Watch List” under the Water Framework Directive (WFD) is a mechanism for obtaining high-quality monitoring data on potential water pollutants, to evaluate the risk they pose and thus whether certain limits (Environmental Quality Standards) should be set. This list is intended to be updated every 2 years. To date, many drugs have already been included in the list (Lertxundi et al., 2021 ), although no quality standard has been set so far (European Commission et al., 2018 ). Recently, in China 10 pharmaceuticals were selected as priority compounds, setting the bases for selecting candidate pollutants in future monitoring studies (Yan et al., 2020 ). Table 1   summarizes examples of how drug pollution can affect SDGs.  5 Goal 7: affordable and clean energy As part of the circular economy, correct management of unused medicines could avoid pharmaceuticals from being released to the environment, while energy can be created in the process. There are interesting initiatives already, in which low-risk drugs are destroyed through energy recovery, that is, they are used as fuel in industrial facilities or to produce electrical energy (Sistema Integrado de Gestión y Recogida de Envases del sector farmacéutico (SIGRE), 2019 ). From a life cycle perspective, recycling drug packaging materials is of critical importance. One study estimated that 85% of solid drugs in Europe are sold in pharmaceutical blisters. So the post-consumer management of this waste is drawing increasing attention (Pilchik, 2000 ). These waste packages usually contain both aluminum and plastic layers, which makes them more difficult to recycle. In fact, across Europe, only around 50% of waste aluminum-containing packaging is recycled for this reason. One study proposes using waste medicine wrappers (aluminum) as an efficient low-cost electrode material for microbial fuel cells devices that convert chemical energy to electrical energy by the action of microorganism (Noori et al., 2020 ). Moreover, some studies have successfully used green solvents to recover this metal and plastic form drug blisters (Nieminen et al., 2020 ).  6 Goal 8: decent work and economic growth Sustainable tourism or “green tourism” should be encouraged as it helps create jobs and promotes local culture and products, allowing economic growth. In certain areas, the landscape, wildlife and environment are the main tourist attractions. Indeed, this kind of tourism may be the principal economic activity of the region, i.e. coral reefs in many tropical countries like the Maldives. But drug pollution in these areas could threaten their main economic inputs (Rizzi et al., 2020 ). Thus, drug pollution abatement may indirectly promote green tourism. After experiencing what has probably been the worst recorded environmental disaster caused by drug pollution (the devastation wrought by diclofenac on vulture populations in Asia) the “Saving Asia's Vultures from Extinction (SAVE) programme” was declared. Such sustainable programme, promoted by a consortium of 24 different partners, uses eco-tourism to help the vulture population recover (vulture restaurants that are visited by ornithologists), but also to economically help involved countries/communities (Saving Asia's Vultures from Extinction (SAVE), 2020 ). Vultures have shown important consequences on biodiversity, politics, tourism, the environment, and agriculture (Choisy, 2013 ). A study carried out in Spain (home of 95% of European vultures), estimated that supplanting the removal of dead livestock by vultures with carcass collection and transport to processing plants meant the emission of 77,344 metric tons of CO2 eq. to the atmosphere per year (Morales-Reyes et al., 2015 ). Therefore, preventing mass vulture death by regulating diclofenac will yield better economic and environmental outcomes than the alternative.  7 Goal 9: industry, innovation and infrastructure Direct emission of pharmaceuticals from drug manufacturing can produce very high concentrations in the environment (up to several mg/l) and should be a matter of concern (Larsson, 2014 ). Much of the scarce available data comes from India and China, which have become the “pharmacy of the developing world” (Rewari et al., 2020 ). But there are also studies coming from several countries in Europe, United States among others (Larsson, 2014 ). Investing efficient industrial wastewater technology is going to be essential. However, the generic substitution system for state subsidized medicine that is applied in many countries, such as Spain, focuses on reducing cost and provides little incentive for companies to invest in ‘greener’ technology. Many actors, including regulatory bodies, and healthcare organizations that buy products, have the potential to create incentives and promote more sustainable innovative attitudes. As an example, the Swedish government now considers pollution control during manufacturing when companies compete to obtain product subsidies (Larsson, 2014 ).  8 Goal 11: sustainable cities and communities The United Nations estimates that 68% of the world population will live in urban areas by 2050 (United Nations (UN) Department of Economy and Social Affairs, 2018 ). But over 80% of the world's wastewater is released to the environment without adequate treatment (United Nations (UN), 2017 ). The combination of these two facts makes modern cities an important source of drug pollution. Although the presence of pharmaceuticals in the environment has been less studied in the Global South, concentrations found are higher than in western countries (Fekadu et al., 2019 ). One important source of some specific drugs (contrast media, certain broad–spectrum antibiotics, some cytostatic drug) are hospitals, which are generally located in urban areas. Hospitals' wastewater contribution to the total mass load of pharmaceuticals in WWTP influents is lower than that of urban wastewater. However, certain compounds may exhibit a relatively high hospital contribution (2017). This problem also occurs in LMIC, where hospitals often discard their effluents without any treatment at all (Chiarello et al., 2016 ). There are already initiatives such as the one implemented in the Herlev hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark, in which hospital wastewater treatment is performed in situ to effectively remove all drugs before they reach the municipal wastewater treatment plant (Grundfos Biobooster, 2020 ). However, this kind of “treatment at source” must prove to be a positive cost-benefit alternative. Many believe such “end-of-pipe” measures should only be watched as complementary to source-directed and use-orientated measures. Probably, an over-emphasis on upgrading WWTP infrastructure is not a sustainable, optimal use of limited resources (The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2019 ).  9 Goal 12: responsible production and consumption The European Parliament has recently urged the European Union to take measures towards more sensible use and disposal of pharmaceuticals to prevent risks to the environment and public health (European Parliament, 2019 ). They acknowledge measures to reduce the pollution should not only include end-of-pipe controls (e.g., improved wastewater treatment), but encompass the entire life cycle of drugs, from design and production to disposal. Source–directed approaches are probably the ones that should be more intensively promoted (The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2019 ). Nevertheless, discovering and implementing better technology to eliminate drugs once they have reached WWTP is a good idea. Among other technologies, ozone and activated carbon can aid the process of drug elimination. But the development of cheaper and more sustainable methods is still urgently needed. We cannot export the “Swiss model” (in which every WWTP is upgraded to treat wastewater with ozone) to every country in the world (Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (EAWAG), 2016 ). However, it would be even better to directly design greener, more biodegradable drugs (i.e., “benign by design” concept (Leder, 2015 )). Although we already have some examples of the development of more “environmentally friendly” active pharmaceutical ingredients and green drug delivery systems, more research is needed to scale these efforts (Banik, 2020 ; Dai et al., 2016 ). We also need to promote eco-friendly pharmaceutical packaging or “sustainable packaging” (Kumar and Gupta, 2012 ; Sustainable pharmaceutical packaging, 2020 ). In addition, ecotoxicological concerns may affect not only the drug but also the whole medicine itself. Consider inhaled loxapine, a recent marketed antipsychotic for the treatment of agitation, which requires one lithium battery to be discarded after each inhalation. In another example, the case of Abilify Mycite®, an electronic circuit is excreted with each ingested capsule (Lertxundi et al., 2020b ). Sadly, societies are already using thousands of different active pharmaceutical ingredients, and for many of them we may simply not find a greener alternative. In addition, we probably need a new definition of what is nowadays considered a “rational drug use” (Orive et al., 2021 ). We need to move towards greener prescription. In sharp contrast with what happens in livestock and other farming animals, for which ecotoxicological data is a pivotal part on the benefit-risk assessment for the marketing authorization of a new drug, environmental aspects in the benefit/risk assessment are not considered for drugs intended for human use. We believe this will change in the future (Orive et al., 2021 ). In fact, this measure already appears in the resolution of 17 September 2020 on a strategic approach to pharmaceuticals in the environment of the European Parliament (European Parliament, 2019 ). Further, considering the continuous increase in the number of pets (Statista, 2020 ), neglecting the impact of veterinary products to be used in dogs and cats is also unwarranted (Little and Boxall, 2020 ; Domingo-Echaburu et al., 2021b ). Up to one-third of patients do not use all medication dispensed by their pharmacy, leading to a waste of healthcare resources and potentially environmental pollution. A systematic review on the practice of medication disposal worldwide shows that the most common method in households is disposal in the garbage, and that the practice of flushing drugs into the sewage system still takes place several countries (Kusturica et al., 2017 ). The adoption of take-back schemes is going to be another key element to adequately confront this problem. This is especially important in countries with poorly functioning waste management schemes where improper medication disposal might be expected (Middle Eastern, Asian and African countries) (Kusturica et al., 2017 ). Strict legal frameworks in addition to well organized, cost-effective and easily accessible state-run disposal systems are necessary to improve “environmental friendly” disposal practices (Kusturica et al., 2017 ). Worryingly, the data show improper medicine disposal to be a global issue prevalent among environmentally aware people (Kusturica et al., 2017 ). Therefore, general public´s awareness on the negative effects of the incorrect disposing of medicines is crucial. In this sense, European healthcare, industry and student organizations have created a joint initiative named Medsdisposal: it is a campaign to raise awareness on how to dispose unused or expired medicines appropriately in Europe, bringing information on current disposal schemes in European countries to one place (MedsDisposal, n.d. ). In LMIC the problem may be bigger as stockpiles of outdated donated medicines can build up and leach into the environment when not safely disposed (Nature Editorial, 2015 ). Optimizing package sizes and extending expiry dates for medicines when possible will allow retaining medicines that can still be used safely. It may also be necessary to explore the idea of reusing drugs. In this sense, a survey carried out in the UK found that more than half of respondents intended or wanted to reuse medicines in the future (Alhamad et al., 2018 ), and a recent study anticipates that “although not permitted in the UK, this position will change in the coming years as medication shortages and worries about environmental waste and financial losses from the destruction of unused medicines are brought to the forefront ” (Donyai et al., 2021 ). Medicines reuse schemes successfully operate in the United States and Greece, reducing medicines waste and environmental pollution, as well as saving money and providing drugs to thousands of people who could not otherwise afford them (Connely, 2018 ). One of the main problems linked to drug reuse is the lack of a proper means to validate the quality of returned medicines. This issue is already being assessed, by the study of the required technologies applicable to the design of pharmaceutical packaging (Hui et al., 2020 ). From a regulatory perspective, “eco-labelling” of high-risk pharmaceutical products for the environment should be explored (The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2019 ).  10 Goal 14: life below water Pharmaceuticals are reaching every environmental matrix, including seawater. However, so far, the potential impact of drugs in sea life and coastal environments has received scant attention, even as 41% of world global population live within coastal limits (Gaw et al., 2014 ). There is increasing evidence that drugs are affecting marine and coastal environments. So far, the majority of data reported for pharmaceutical concentrations in marine organisms are for antibiotics used in aquaculture (Gaw et al., 2014 ). There is a less or no data in many regions (Africa, South America and Oceania). For example, a study found several pharmaceuticals (antidepressants like fluoxetine, caffeine) in sponges from coral reefs in the Maldives archipelago (Rizzi et al., 2020 ). The presence of pharmaceuticals in marine biota should be a matter of concern; especially in places were the coral plays a vital role in people´s livelihood and economy. A recent study from Italy has showed that pharmaceuticals were ubiquitously present in tissues of Mediterranean mussels (carbamazepine was measured in more than 90% of analyzed samples). Worryingly, organisms were collected from sites representative of relatively unpolluted marine waters along the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian Sea (Mezzelani et al., 2020 ). Moreover, there are studies showing that drugs do not only reach seawater and related water filtering-organisms, but can bioaccumulate through the food web. In concrete, a study carried out in North-Western Spain showed that tissues of representative seafood species of bivalves, cephalopods, arthropods, and fish of high economic importance contained several compounds. The benzodiazepine alprazolam and the antidepressant citalopram were detected in the tissues of common octopus (Martínez-Morcillo et al., 2020 ). Another study carried out in wild European fish results show that for 2 drugs, fish had plasma concentrations higher than the concentrations reached in blood of human patients taking the corresponding drug (Cerveny et al., 2021 ). The study by Miller et al. reviewed all the data available about bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals in aquatic fauna (Miller et al., 2018 ). Again, so far, these studies warn about possible hazards associated to high consumption of seafood in sensitive population groups. However, the potential impact of these drugs have the potential on ecosystem population dynamics is yet to be elucidated (Saaristo et al., 2018 ).  11 Goal 15: life on land Ordinarily, healthcare professionals, generally suffering from an anthropic bias, do not pay much attention to the phylogenetic origins of dopamine or serotonin, or if plants may be somehow affected by the benzodiazepines they accumulate. But, of course, as many environmentalists know well, therapeutic targets wherein human and veterinary drugs act are not human-specific. For example, biogenic monoamines and their respective receptors are found in amphibians, fish, insects and echinoderms (Bauknecht and Jékely, 2017 ; Turlejski, 1996 ). Consider the novel tank test, which is used as a sensitive and efficient behavioral assay in basic psychopharmacology studies for drugs to be used in humans, which uses zebra fish (Stewar et al., 2011 ). Indeed, some of these substances operate on evolutionarily ancient pathways, even found in organisms outside the animal kingdom. For example, acetylcholine is present in fungi, plants and bacteria (Horiuchi et al., 2003 ) and serotonin in plants (Mukherjee, 2018 ). Recently some authors have highlighted the importance of using proper behavioral endpoints in the regulation of chemicals, including pharmaceuticals (Ford et al., 2021 ). Until recently, most of the attention about the consequences of pharmaceuticals in the environment has been devoted to aquatic wildlife. Nevertheless, the most remarkable example that best represents the consequences of pharmaceuticals in the environment was the near extinction of several species of vultures in Asia due to the nephrotoxic effects of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac, used widely in livestock (Oaks et al., 2004 ). Very recently, the first case of diclofenac intoxication of an avian scavenger in Europe has been documented (Herrero-Villar et al., 2021 ). Recently a few additional studies show drugs have the potential to bio-magnify beyond aquatic organism, in terrestrial arthropods. In particular, the accumulation of ivermectin used in veterinary in dung beetles was shown in a study in which the authors present a terrestrial test system that considers the dietary pathway from livestock feces to organisms for the first time (Verdú et al., 2020 ). A study performed in five rivers in Australia showed that drug contamination was not limited to the stream channel, as emerging adult insects transferred pharmaceuticals into adjacent terrestrial ecosystems (Richmond et al., 2018 ). More recently, a study has shown bioaccumulation patterns and trophic cross-ecosystem transfer of pharmaceuticals from aquatic primary producers to terrestrial predators (Previšic et al., 2021 ).  12 Goal 17: partnership for the goals One of the objectives of this goal is to enhance international support for implementing effective and targeted capacity-building in LMIC to support national plans to implement all the SDGs. In this sense, we highlight the need for global cooperation between countries to better understand the impact of pharmaceuticals in the environment (Lees et al., 2016 ). More than ever, both biomedical and environmental scientific disciplines should work together to better understand the problem of drug pollution, its consequences and, crucially, possible solutions. A truly interdisciplinary approach, involving all the stakeholders in the complex life cycle of drugs (without forgetting the healthcare sector!) is going to be a key element for success in attaining all SDGs.  13 Discussion Drugs have brought unquestionable benefits to human and animal health, and we envision that their use will continue to be essential to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being. By enabling longer, healthier lives, reproductive control, and reducing risks of infection, drugs can be the Holy Grail for the achieving health-related SDGs. But the growth of drug consumption in the last decades has also led to increased presence of pharmaceuticals in the environment around the world. With still not fully established direct and indirect ecotoxicological consequences in waters and on land, and especially due to bioaccumulation through the food web, pharmaceutical pollution can become Achilles Heel for achieving the SDGs. Tackling this complex problem will need the participation of all the actors that participate in the life cycle of drugs, without forgetting the healthcare sector, which needs to adopt a true One Health approach that needs to go beyond antimicrobial use. In order to effectively fight pharmaceutical pollution, both at source measures, like a more rational use of drugs, will need to be complemented with end of pipe measures that improve wastewater treatment in a sustainable manner. Although drugs are only mentioned in one of the seventeen SDGs (in goal 3, good health & wellbeing), in this article we have shown that pharmaceuticals in general, and drug pollution in particular, can have an impact in at least 12 of the 17 SDGs, in ways that are not apparent at first sight. We therefore believe tackling drug pollution is going to be essential in order to achieve the SDGs.  Funding information None.
