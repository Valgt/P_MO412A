                  Background
                  Climate change, poverty, hunger and complex diseases are just some of the many wicked problems impacting human health. The Sustainable Development Goals aim to alleviate these and many other global issues. Although the nursing profession is paramount to successfully achieving the goals, nurses require increased education to maximise their contributions.
               
                  Objectives
                  The aim of this study was to determine the impact of education on graduate nurses' action towards the Sustainable Development Goals.
               
                  Design
                  This study applied a qualitative case study methodology.
               
                  Setting
                  The study took place within an Australian Higher Education institution. Graduate nurses working in clinical settings were invited to reflect on the Sustainable Development Goals.
               
                  Participants
                  Participants included thirteen graduate nurses (n = 13) working in a variety of clinical settings that had completed the final year capstone subject.
               
                  Methods
                  Individual semi-structured interviews were undertaken with graduate nurses who undertook education on the Sustainable Development Goals in an undergraduate Bachelor of Nursing capstone subject. The interviews were transcribed and thematically analysed.
               
                  Findings
                  Data was analysed through two lens focusing on the barriers and opportunities for action towards the Sustainable Development Goals. Three core barriers were identified as ‘Drowning’; ‘Powerless’; and ‘Invisible’. Three key opportunities were designated as ‘War on Waste’; ‘Front and Centre’; and ‘Revolutionary Leadership’.
               
                  Conclusions
                  Educating undergraduate nurses on the Sustainable Development Goals had limited impact on specific graduate nurses' action towards the goals due to significant barriers within the healthcare system. However, graduate nurses recognised the importance of contributing to the goals and identified opportunities for future action. Education providers and the healthcare industry should work in partnership to create a more sustainable future for healthcare.

World hunger, poverty, the climate crisis, rising costs of living, global pandemics and increasing numbers of communicable and non-communicable diseases are threatening health for both people and planet. The core purpose of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted by the member states of the United Nations (UN, 2015 ), is to take action to solve these and many other wicked problems of the world. In order to take action, research shows that education is key (Fields et al., 2021 ). However, to date there is a deficit in research investigating education for nurses on the SDGs specifically relating to its impact on action in the clinical practice environment.  2 Background Health is impacted by complex problems at both a local and global level. Rising costs of living, unprecedented weather patterns and global pandemics are just some of the many issues causing an increased burden on health (Romanello et al., 2022 ). Of increasing concern, climate change has been labelled ‘the biggest global health threat of the 21st century’ (Watts et al., 2015 , p.1898) with the UN Secretary-General labelling the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report a ‘code red for humanity’ (UN, 2021 ). These compounding global challenges highlight the importance of taking immediate action towards the SDGs, in particular those targeting environmental betterment, which has never been more urgent. As a profession, nursing is recognised as paramount to achievement of the SDGs (World Health Organization, 2020 ). Further, the SDGs offer an important framework to enable nurses to see the interconnectedness of social, economic and environmental issues on health (Dossey et al., 2019 ; Sensor et al., 2021 ). There is also a strong alignment between principles considered fundamental to both the SDGs and nursing including those seeking justice and equity (Gürgen Şimşek and Erkin, 2022 ; Sensor et al., 2021 ). Scholars, however, suggest that nurses are limited in their knowledge of the goals and action towards attainment (Chiu et al., 2022 ; Fields et al., 2021 ). The proposed reasons for this inaction include a lack of awareness about the SDGs, feelings of powerlessness regarding the magnitude of the issues encompassed by the goals and concerns on the relevance of the SDGs to the role of the nurse (Fields et al., 2021 ). Educating nursing students on the goals is recommended as a way to strengthen nursing awareness and contributions (Anåker et al., 2021 ; Fields et al., 2022 ). However, to date there has been limited research exploring the outcomes of sustainability education for nurses. This paper presents the findings of a qualitative case study that sought to educate undergraduate nurses on the SDGs in order to explore the impact of this education on their actionable steps towards the goals in clinical practice.  3 Methods 3.1 Design A qualitative case study design was employed for this research. Case studies are most suited to research involving real-world, contemporary events (Yin, 2009 ). A case study methodology was considered commensurate with the intensions of the study, to generate an in-depth understanding of a complex issue by capturing a range of perspectives within a setting. The main research question guiding the study and data collection was, are nursing graduates taking action towards the SDGs following an educational intervention ? The educational intervention used to inform this study involved embedding the SDGs into a 6 credit point capstone subject1  1 A ‘capstone’ subject, like the subject examined in this study, is a final course taken by students that focuses on building soft skills, summarising the degree, and providing skills for students to use in their transition to the workforce (Pembridge and Paretti, 2019 )   for final year undergraduate nursing students. The subject formed part of the core Bachelor of Nursing program and approximately 450 students undertook the capstone subject. Each week students completed activities, experiences and assessments underpinned by or related to the SDGs. When embedding SDGs in nursing curricular, Fields et al. (2022)  recommend experiential and critical pedagogies (see Freire, 1970 ) which enable reflective and practical explorations of complex issues. The educational intervention was therefore designed along a ‘transformative continuum’ using principles of critical pedagogy. Fields et al.'s (2022)  paper highlights several stages involved in educating nursing students on the SDGs when employing critical pedagogy. The continuum begins with enlightening or raising awareness about the SDGs through critical discussion, debate and reflection. The next stage moves to empowering students to take action in, for example, clinical placements and capstone projects. The overarching aim for the educational intervention was for graduates to be liberated, that is contributing towards the goals as practitioners (Fields et al., 2023 ).  3.2 Participants Of the 450 students educated in the capstone subject, 13 graduate nurse participants were recruited. Each participant had recently graduated from an Australian university (approximately six months post-graduation) and had completed a final year subject which included an educational intervention on the SDGs. Participants worked in a variety of clinical settings including intensive care, coronary care, surgical, medical, general practice, operating theatres, paediatrics, aged care, and emergency. Participants worked across both public and private sectors and metropolitan and regional facilities (see Table 1  ).  3.3 Data collection Data was collected through semi-structured interviews to determine the influence of education on nurses taking action towards the goals. Examples of questions included: what can you recall about the SDGs from your undergraduate education;  and in what ways do you take action towards the SDGs in your current clinical role?  Interviews were conducted via Zoom© and took approximately 60 min.  3.4 Data analysis Qualitative data analysis is concerned with developing meaning from experience. It is an inductive and reflexive process, requiring re-examination and refocusing (Srivastava and Hopwood, 2009 ). For qualitative researchers it is common practice to apply an established methodological framework for data analysis (Pietkiewicz and Smith, 2014 ). Analysis of the data included a systematic and transparent method following Braun and Clarke's (2021)  most recent six-stage process of thematic analysis. Stage 1: becoming familiar with the data; involved transcription of the interviews and each researcher individually reviewing and re-reviewing the transcriptions. Stage 2: generating codes; involved each researcher highlighting important phrases and key messages shared by participants. Stage 3: creating initial themes; involved the researchers coming together and grouping similar phrases and ideas into preliminary themes. Stage 4: reviewing themes; involved the researchers as a group reflecting on the themes to ensure they accurately represented the data presented. Stage 5: defining and naming themes; involved the researchers providing a systematic definition and precise naming of each of the themes to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the data. Finally Stage 6: writing a narrative; involved constructing a narrative that presented the research findings in a clear and meaningful manner, capturing the essence of the identified themes (Braun and Clarke, 2021 ). Data was analysed based on the research question and through the lens of ‘Barriers’ and ‘Opportunities’.  3.5 Ethical considerations Ethical approval was obtained for this study from the University's Human Research Ethics Committee. Each participant was provided with a participant information sheet and signed a consent form prior to data collection. Participation in this study was voluntary. To ensure anonymity any information that may identify participants was removed on transcription.   4 Findings Thirteen graduate nurses participated in this study, 11 that identified as female and 2 as male. The findings yielded two overarching themes (i) ‘barriers’ and (ii) ‘opportunities’ that guide actionable steps towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. 4.1 Theme 1. Barriers The first theme pertained to the barriers graduate nurses experienced in making contributions to the SDGs in the clinical setting. These barriers were grouped into the sub-themes Drowning, Powerless  and Invisible.  4.1.1 Sub-theme 1.1. Drowning Drowning  was noted as a sub-theme to encompass participants' sentiments regarding the overwhelming sense they experience as nurses, attributed to the scarcity of time and staffing, thereby forming a barrier that hinders SDG action. Speaking to the demands of the role and ability to only focus on the immediate work of helping patients, one participant described themselves like a robot on autopilot (Participant 6) . Other participants expressed concerns with being time poor, every level of healthcare does not seem to have enough staffing and all these holes are showing. And we're all too busy. We're all too stressed (Participant 1).  Another expressed,My experience is that it's just so busy… it's just so hectic … I feel like I'm running around like a chook with its head cut off… I don't have time to even think about that kind of stuff (Participant 4).  Participants noted that being able to only manage the bare minimum  reduced the ability to connect with the SDGs, people don't they don't feel like they have time to, you know, recycle the cardboard from the medications and you know separate plastics and paper and all that sort of stuff (Participant 2).  Also highlighted was the unnecessary waste due to the inability to pause and take stock, the complexities of learning a new role and the anxieties or uncertainties that come with it,I have been so kind of flustered and kind of just busy that there will be times where I will put on a pair of gloves - for no reason at all, take them off, go do the thing I was meant to do, come back, put them on and do what I need to do. And then I've just used six pairs of bloody gloves in three minutes for no reason (Participant 1).    4.1.2 Sub-theme 1.2. Powerless Being new nurses, participants reported their perceptions of feeling restricted or disempowered to make any changes, because, for example, I feel like the nurses on the ward would be like you're only new why are you trying to like change things (Participant 3),  or the more experienced nurses would just be like ‘she's still a new grad, what's she on about’? (Participant 6).  One participant expressed being in a stable position could aid intervention on the SDGs,I think, because, I am a new grad and I'm trying to just figure out and, learn so much, and keep my head above water, … I feel like your mind is just so preoccupied with that that you're not even thinking about those sort of things (Participant 8).   Participants disclosed a sense of powerlessness, hopelessness and a lack of autonomy (Participant 2) against ‘the system’. One mentioned, I'm just one person. I'm not going to make a difference, so why would I change what I'm doing? (Participant 3). Another echoed this sentiment, being one person within the larger system,I guess it's hard when you've got kind of systems above yourself that are kind of preventing that. Like the amount of electricity we use, like the amount of plastic, the amount of waste that we produce … we can do our own part, but I don't know if we could prevent the amount like the wide scale that we actually have of it (Participant 13).   Several participants expressed hesitation when it came to suggestions for implementing change for fear of stepping on people's toes (Participant 8)  and hostility (Participant 5).  One participant described themselves as fresh meat (Participant 6) , while another pointed out a lot of new grads are hesitant to bring up change because they feel like questioning that hierarchy… they feel like they might experience some backlash. (Participant 9).   4.1.3 Sub-theme 1.3. Invisible Apart from one participant, graduates shared they had no further exposure to the goals since commencing as nurses in the clinical setting. A participant reflected,That's your barrier. Nobody talking about them. Nobody references them… not that I ever noticed anyway, so nobody talking about them how are you supposed to implement them if you don't know they exist (Participant 1).   Participants felt that a lack of exposure to the goals since commencing in clinical practice was the reason they were able to recall so little about the goals and therefore articulate action taken towards them, they're not exposed enough, so I don't think about them, because I don't see them. (Participant 5)  and I feel like it is that lack of visual … there is no reminder of the Sustainable Development Goals, of them existing and it can lead to people forgetting that it's actually a thing (Participant 9).  Participants suggested that the reasons the SDGs were not visible in the clinical environment were because this was just not their priority  (Participant 10) and also felt many of their colleagues, particularly those that had graduated several years earlier, had never heard of the goals: if I said the sustainable goals, they wouldn't have an idea what they are or how many there were (Participant 3).    4.2 Theme 2. Opportunities The second theme expands on opportunities nurses identified that could increase nursing action towards the goals. These opportunities relate to three sub-these War on Waste , Front and Centre  and Revolutionary Leadership.  4.2.1 Sub-theme 2.1. War on waste Participants in this study expressed concern for environmental aspects of sustainability (which may encompass SDG6, SDG12 and SDG13 for example) and a strong desire for future contributions towards these goals. Participants recognised the consequences of inaction and the impact of problems such as climate change on health and the importance of mitigation, I just think if we don't address the goals, we're stuffed (Participant 10).  All participants were vocal in their concerns about the fact that there's so much waste (Participant 3)  in the provision of healthcare. Accounts from participants were emotional when referring to waste, it just saddens me… just seeing the amount of waste that hospitals produce and the amount of times the cleaners have to change each of the garbage bags (Participant 9).  Throwing out materials were met with understanding but contention, I feel so bad, every time I do something. I'm just chucking out plastic syringes left, right and centre (Participant 8)  and it's just chucked out, which is understandable, but it still is an amount of waste (Participant 13).  Participants raised concerns with the norms many nurses have established with disposing of drugs reflecting that most of the time they do go down the sink  (Participant 11). One remarked, there's nothing to say don't put it down the sink. There's no signs… and you've got like all these drugs going down the sink (Participant 8).  Examples of this practice included:I remember the first day that I had to discard the rest of a fentanyl syringe. There was probably like 30mls of fentanyl in there, so quite a decent amount. I remember saying to the other RN that I had to check it with to discard, this is such a waste and … they were like you can put it in the sharps bin or give it to the fishies and I was like, well, let's  not give it to the fishies (Participant 3).    Having visual cues was mentioned by several graduates as a useful reminder to raise awareness. One stated, maybe there should be a little sign on the tap of the sink, saying no drugs down here (Participant 8)  while another suggested, put a poster on the store room door saying stop and think like what are you gonna use and why (Participant 3).  Several other participants noticed that being sustainable required cognitive pauses to increase mindfulness of their practice, I always have to stop and think about, maybe even write down and look at the policy every piece of equipment that I need so I know I'm not unnecessarily wasting things (Participant 3).  Although pausing mid-practice is not always easy, I just feel like if I wasn't quite as under the pump… I'd have a minute to be like OK what do I need to do here and take that minute now (Participant 1) . Participants recognise the need for this change and further advocated for increasing the visibility of the SDGs as a further opportunity for action.  4.2.2 Sub-theme 2.2. Front and centre To raise the visibility of global and local sustainability concerns, participants suggested in-services, ward initiatives, such as SDG of the month, and posters to place the goals front and centre. One participant identified that it is likely the UN purposely designed the goals to be visually capturing, reflecting, to bring awareness to the daily and plaster it all over the walls… They made it look pretty to make it attractive… . Let's let it do what it was supposed to do (Participant 1).  Some participants suggested practical group training to raise awareness, like a few in services… so instead of just like sitting there and listening to it, giving some ideas and implementing it (Participant 8).  However, others cautioned against training, especially when mandatory,We are already bombarded with all this… mandatory training and things we have to do, that I feel like nobody is going to want to do any more than they have to… I feel like making them sit and click through on my health learning module about the Sustainable Development Goals isn't going to ignite anything in anybody. It's not going to make them want to really pay attention to it and I don't think that's the way to bring awareness to it. I think it needs to be done in a way that you know grabs people's attention… and gets them interested (Participant 2).   Suggestions were made to embed education on the goals from the beginning of the degree (Participant 13)  rather than just in the final year as a way to improve awareness and recall. For example, If you bring it up in every subject for three years, it is going to be ingrained (Participant 1) , and at the start of each subject, you know, these are the specific aims towards the SDGs that this subject focuses on… then that's at the back of your mind as you work your way through the subject (Participant 10).  Several participants also suggested the need to align education on the SDGs more strongly to clinical placement to support students to link theory to practice such as doing something hands-on while they're on placement (Participant 5).  Practical application of the SDGs was recommended as a way forward,Because if you can use it in a practical setting and understand how to use it more in that … I'm thinking this is something that I can do, you know, don't put my antibiotics down the sink, and I'm going to remember I can help the environment by just doing this one simple little step (Participant 7).   Highlighting the SDGs throughout the degree including on placement was underscored as an opportunity for increasing awareness, maybe we start introducing it first year … and then you can keep an eye out for how the development goals were in our placements, and what changes we could make (Participant 11).  4.2.3 Sub-theme 2.3. Revolutionary leadership Participants recognised there are small actions that we can make (Participant 2)  to create a wave of change, noting that even one person can have that impact (Participant 1).  Participants reflected on the impact they could have, Even one person can probably do something that achieves the Sustainable Development Goals… one small change could develop into a major change if everyone starts doing it (Participant 9).  Taking action locally was recognised as productive of bigger change, like a ripple effect they probably all link up with each other at some point, but it's just about doing one, and then each one will like will have an effect on something else (Participant 8).  Participants also described the need for a sustainability champion to drive change. One stated, definitely someone needs to just like, you know, be a good lead, lead a good example for others (Participant 7)  and other echoed these sentiments, we probably need someone to come in and say, so these are the goals this is what we're gonna try and change (Participant 3).  While another had reservations for SDG training, they also noted the champion as a potential approach for ongoing action, but then is it going to be something that just gets fizzled out? You know you need someone to keep up on it that's the issue (Participant 8).  Despite seeing the hierarchy as a barrier, participants also acknowledged the need for positional power for the most impact. Most participants felt that as newly graduated nurses they were not in the best position to implement action towards the SDGs and instead a top-down (Participant 1)  approach was recommended, you'd need somebody higher than you telling you this is what we expect (Participant 6)  and, a top-down approach needs to happen. I think that's where the biggest change would actually come from (Participant 1) . One participant reflected on nursing leadership, people in leadership positions definitely do have that ability through changing policy, recycling and, changing the way we source our resources to more environmentally friendly things (Participant 2).     5 Discussion The global healthcare system is under constant scrutiny due to persistent nursing shortages, inadequate staffing ratios, heightened stress levels, and an overwhelming workload for existing staff (Tamata and Mohammadnezhad, 2023 ). Amidst this backdrop, early career nurses embark on their professional journeys, not only learning the practical aspects of nursing but also assimilating themselves into the intricate fabric of social, power dynamics, and cultural conditions within their workplace. Interestingly, these graduate nurses often express a desire to conform and integrate into established teams, prioritising assimilation over advocating for sustainable practices, even when recognising potential areas for improvement. The findings suggest several reasons for this, including not wanting to ‘step on toes’, to avoid ‘backlash’ and because they see themselves as part of a larger impenetrable system. One potential catalyst for change lies in the emotional concerns of participants regarding waste. Each participant expressed a desire to pursue future action towards more environmentally focused SDGs. All participants had concerns regarding the amount of waste produced in the provision of healthcare and could identify several goals where they may be able to contribute in the future, however felt unsure how. Research has highlighted that individuals experiencing eco-guilt are more inclined to seek pro-environmental actions (Sörqvist and Langeborg, 2019 ). This notion aligns with the ‘revolutionary leadership’ concept defined by Freire (1970) , where leaders take bold and innovative stances, inviting all stakeholders to engage in the societal reconstruction process. Freire (1970)  further asserts that liberation requires awareness and a sense of empowerment to drive action. This assertion holds relevance in the context of SDGs, where every individual should feel empowered to contribute to transformative change. In this study, graduate nurses, while navigating the complexities of their roles, have identified both barriers and opportunities to enhance workplace sustainability. Their insights underscore that while these new nurses possess the ability to recognise waste and avenues for sustainability improvement, the perceived barriers to achieving these goals outweigh other work priorities and external factors. These findings unveil two significant considerations. First, education about the SDGs does influence how student nurses perceive workplace dynamics, enabling them to discern the impact of sustainability and equity goals. Second, while educating graduate nurses is crucial, translating this education into actionable SDG implementation faces challenges due to the multitude of factors influencing new professionals' adaptation to their roles and environments. These findings offer a roadmap for potential policy changes and professional development initiatives in clinical practice. By leveraging opportunities and minimising barriers, incremental yet impactful progress can be achieved, one workplace at a time. This study sheds light on the role of formal SDG education within undergraduate nursing curricula, emphasising the need for a more integrated approach. While educational institutions play a pivotal role in raising awareness and cultivating positive attitudes towards the SDGs among nursing students, the study underscores the critical need for healthcare organisations to take more proactive steps in fostering ongoing sustainability efforts among their workforce. Horizontalism, a concept rooted in mutuality, unity, and trust (Freire, 1970 , p. 165), should serve as a guiding principle to bridge the gap between education and real-world application, creating a seamless continuum of sustainability-focused nursing practice. In essence, while education is essential, the healthcare system must adopt a more holistic and sustained approach to empower nurses to drive tangible change in their clinical environments.  6 Recommendations Several actionable recommendations emerge to propel integration of SDGs into clinical practice. There is a need for enhanced visibility of sustainability through mediums like posters and in-service sessions, emphasising specific goals and possibly adopting a recognition incentive such as “goal of the month”. By facilitating such visual cues, healthcare organisations can amplify awareness and the impact of SDGs. Encouraging healthcare practitioners to pause, deliberate, and consider the implications of their actions is also essential, to consider not only within the immediate healthcare system but also the broader planetary repercussions. Creating purposeful moments for reflection will raise consciousness and stimulate decision-making that aligns with SDGs' principles, fostering sustainable practices. Finally, promoting the role of organisational leadership to discuss and action sustainability could lead to the prominence and visibility of SDGs. Forging stronger clinical leadership advocacy and collaborations between higher education institutions and healthcare facilities are important strategies. When educators and practitioners are on the same page, the integration of SDGs could become more seamless and effective, transcending theoretical concepts into tangible, impactful actions within clinical settings.  7 Limitations Limitations of this research include that it was restricted to one cohort of graduates from one university. The participants were also recently graduated nurses (approximately 6 months in practice). Nurses that have been working clinically for longer periods and are possibly more confident in the role are likely to have differing experiences. Future research should be undertaken with diverse cohorts of participants.  8 Conclusion For transformative change to occur within society, individuals must feel empowered, respected, and believe in the existence of equality (Melling and Pilkington, 2018 ). Ironically, the participants in this study report quite the opposite – a sense of disempowerment, hopelessness, and perpetuating hierarchical power imbalances. Addressing this, it becomes evident that nursing, in its pursuit of promoting social action, must first confront the systemic issues in a ‘culture that had stymied empowerment and creativity’ (Lamb et al., 2020 , p. 120). Despite undertaking education on the SDGs in their undergraduate degrees, this study highlights that as graduates, nurses are taking little action towards the SDGs. The barriers to this action included staffing shortages, competing priorities, feeling overwhelmed and powerlessness and a lack of visibility of the goals in clinical practice. There is, however, hope for future action towards the goals by acknowledging their importance and committing to create change. By leveraging organisational leadership, promoting mindfulness, and fostering collaboration, healthcare systems can take significant strides towards not only advancing patient care but also embracing their role as stewards of a sustainable future.
