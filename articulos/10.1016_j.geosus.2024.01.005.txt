                  The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are significantly off-course as we reach the midpoint of their 2030 deadline. From a scientific perspective, the critical challenge in achieving the SDGs lies in the need for more scientific principles to understand the complex socio-ecological systems (SES) and their interactions influencing the 17 SDGs. Here, we propose a scientific framework to clarify the common scientific principles and the rational treatment of diversity under these principles. The framework’s core is revealing the complex mechanisms underlying the achievement of each Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) and SDG interactions. Building upon the identified mechanisms, complex SES models can be established, and the implementation of SDGs can be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, seeking a compromise in competition between essential costs and desired benefits. Our framework can assist countries, and even the world in accelerating progress towards the SDGs.

The SDGs status and interactions of an SES at a specific scale (SDGs_S&I) are influenced by social-ecological interactions within the targeted SES (I SE ), interactions between this system and other connected SES at the same scale through telecoupling processes (I R ), and cross-scale interactions between this system and SES at other scales (I CS ). These mechanisms exhibit variations under different development modes (M ) and at different development stages (T ).

From a scientific perspective, the critical challenge in achieving the SDGs lies in the need for more scientific principles to understand the complex socio-ecological systems (SES) and their interactions influencing the 17 SDGs. Here, we propose a scientific framework to clarify the common scientific principles and the rational treatment of diversity under these principles. The framework’s core is revealing the complex mechanisms underlying the achievement of each Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) and SDG interactions. Building upon the identified mechanisms, complex SES models can be established, and the implementation of SDGs can be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, seeking a compromise in competition between essential costs and desired benefits. Our framework can assist countries, and even the world in accelerating progress towards the SDGs.    1 Challenges of the Sustainable Development Goals The United Nations (UN) adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development  in 2015, presenting a shared blueprint for joint sustainable actions for all countries (United Nations, 2015 ). At the agenda’s core are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), covering 169 targets and over 230 unique indicators and balancing sustainable development’s economic, social, and environmental dimensions. These goals point out the critical areas for peace and prosperity for people and the planet now and in the future. Regrettably, the SDGs are woefully off-track halfway towards their 2030 deadline. As UN Secretary-General, Mr. Guterres, warned during the SDG Summit 2023 that only 15% of SDG targets are on track, about half are moderately or severely off track, and more than one-third have yet to see any movement or regressed below the 2015 starting line. Urgent actions are required to address the cascading and interlinked crises dominated by pandemics, climate change, and conflicts. Given that the 17 SDGs are integrated, indivisible, and interact in intricate ways, achieving them presents a typical complex system problem involving science, technology, engineering, and policy. No nation or region can isolate itself from this collective challenge for humanity. At the mid-point to 2030, progress towards achieving the SDGs varies significantly across countries and regions, with different strengths and weaknesses (Wu et al., 2023 ). Actions aimed at one goal may reinforce or offset the actions for another, resulting in synergies and trade-offs among the SDGs (Nilsson et al., 2016 ). These interactions and the importance of different SDGs in these synergies and trade-offs also differ among countries (Lusseau and Mancini, 2019 ; Wu et al., 2023 ) and at various development stages (Wu et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, a country’s actions may yield negative externalities for other nations through activities extending beyond national borders, such as trade and other cross-border activities (Fu et al., 2020 ). The cross-scale interactions spanning global, national, regional, and local sustainable development further compound the complexity of achieving the SDGs.  2 Scientific framework for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals From a scientific perspective, the fundamental issue in achieving the SDGs lies in the need for more scientific principles to understand the complex socio-ecological systems (SES) and their interactions that influence the 17 SDGs. Based on these considerations, we propose a framework to clarify the common scientific principles and the rational treatment of diversity under these principles, which is crucial for accelerating the achievement of the SDGs and establishing a sustainable economic and social governance system. The framework’s core is the holistic and dynamic analyses of social-ecological processes and relations underlying the achievement of each SDG and SDGs interactions (Fig. 1  ). Although an increasing number of studies assess the SDG’s status and investigate SDGs interactions at various scales, insights into the diverse mechanisms behind them still need to be explored. These mechanisms should encompass 1) social-ecological interactions within the targeted SES at a specific analytical scale (local, regional, national, global); 2) interactions between this system and other connected SES at the same scale through telecoupling processes (e.g., trade, investment, or knowledge transfer); and 3) cross-scale interactions between this system and SES at other scales (Liu, 2023 ). These mechanisms will exhibit variations across different regions, under different development modes, and at different stages (Wu et al., 2022 ). Based on the identified mechanisms, complex network system models corresponding to different scales (local, regional, national, global) can be established. This necessitates quantitative expressions of interactions between various social-ecological factors and their links to the status of corresponding SDGs, represented by nodes and their linkages within the complex network. Selecting specific nodes to construct the network depends on different regions’ distinct requirements and boundary conditions. The interaction parameters and network structure variations mirror differences in primary status and constraints, such as resource availability, development levels, and demographic composition. With a deepened understanding of the intricate mechanisms influencing SDGs and their interactions, the essential costs (e.g., water, energy, and resources) and desired benefits (e.g., no poverty, health, equal education, and safe society) (Fu et al., 2019 ) can be determined. Their status can be normalized for comparison. Depending on the specific circumstances and requirements of different systems at different scales, the weights of each cost and benefit can be set and adjusted following certain principles. Through the integration of costs and benefits, SDGs can be implemented as a multi-objective optimization problem of reasonable balance between costs and benefits (Huang et al., 2018 ), subject to the constraints of the abovementioned mechanisms. The critical social-ecological factors within the corresponding complex network system models are the regulatory measures for various policies. Effective governance (e.g., building sustainable cities and communities, establishing responsible production and consumption models, and adopting climate-change control standards) (Fu et al., 2019 ) can aid in finding a compromise in competition between essential costs and desired benefits (Chen, 2023 ). Achieving such multi-objective optimization requires transformative actions in governments, civil society, science, and business. The components above form the scientific framework for optimizing the path to achieve the SDGs. This framework provides universal scientific principles for global coordination and considers the diversity across various regions and scales. The complex system model’s interaction parameters and network structure can be tailored to reflect diverse realities. At the same time, the weights of essential costs and desired benefits can be adjusted to address different priorities, thus facilitating the diversity of regulation.  3 Potential research directions within the scientific framework The framework we have proposed for the analysis and synthesis across different scales has the potential to assist countries and the world in navigating their paths towards achieving the SDGs. The sustainable development challenge for humanity calls for global openness, collaboration, inclusiveness, and wisdom. Building upon the framework and relevant scientific principles, we suggest exploring the following potential research directions:(1) Laying the data foundation for understanding the mechanisms.  Despite advancements, substantial data gaps persist in all areas of the SDGs regarding geographic coverage, timeliness, and the level of disaggregation required (United Nations Department of Economic Social Affairs, 2023 ). SDG monitoring must be enhanced by integrating national statistical offices, international organizations, earth observation, spatial data infrastructure, commercial data, and citizen-generated data (Fritz et al., 2019 ).  (2) Revealing the mechanisms.  Analyzing the intricate mechanisms influencing SDGs status and interactions across different regions and scales; identifying critical social-ecological factors and processes and quantifying their complex relations; determining key opportunities and challenges for sustainable development and specifying priorities; identifying boundary conditions whose triggering could severely damage ecosystems and threaten the stability of societies.  (3) Modeling the mechanisms.  Constructing complex SES models for different regions and scales based on the identified critical factors and processes; modeling complex social-ecological processes and their impacts on SDG status and analyzing interactions across different dimensions, regions, and scales; dynamically simulating changes of SES and SDG status under various scenarios.  (4) Regulating based on the mechanisms.  Systematically analyzing typical sustainable development cases at different scales and summarizing regulating or transforming measures; utilizing complex SES models to explore the future attainment of SDGs under different regulating or transforming measures; scientifically optimizing pathways to achieve a compromise in competition between essential costs and desired benefits within a safe and just space.
