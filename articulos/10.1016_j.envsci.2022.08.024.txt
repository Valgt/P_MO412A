                  This paper reflects broadly on how artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) can contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It is argued that overall, the sector will not contribute in any meaningful way towards the SDGs by 2030.

This is because nobody really cares enough about the sector for a number of reasons which the paper outlines. In respect of global policymaking priorities, the impacts of ASM pale in comparison in terms of size and impacts to other much more immediate global social and environmental concerns. Moreover, ASM is a symptom of limited socioeconomic development and not an activity that has proven itself likely to contribute to improved socioeconomic conditions. This makes it an unappealing prospect for global, longer term sustainable development approaches. These higher-level issues percolate down to the national level, where the sector’s negative associations, the complexities of attempting to manage it, and a notable bias towards the easy funds from large-scale extractive industries, combine to make it an easy issue to overlook or avoid altogether. In terms of supply chains that link ASM with the rest of the world, the vast percentage of those buying metals and minerals extracted by artisanal operators have repeatedly proven that they have next to no qualms about the conditions under which they were produced.

Table 1    SDG Relationship to ASM Justification   1 – No poverty Weak ASM is typically cited as offering a potential escape from poverty, providing a lifeline to those in a situation of desperation, and being an engine of rural growth. We could even go so far as to suggest that, in certain contexts, artisanal miners are not members of the poorest segments of society (e.g. some ASM operations in South America). Yet, we often have sector-specific ‘poverty traps’ and hand-to-mouth existence for most miners. In some contexts, and compared to other livelihoods, ASM has reduced (and could further reduce) the number of people living under the US$1.25 a day baseline as per SDG 1.1 by 2030. Formalization efforts could facilitate greater ownership of land and resources as per SDG 1.4. But owing to the finite nature of the extracted resources, neither can be said to be ‘sustainable’, at least in the spirit of the Goals.  2 – Zero Hunger Weak If money can be generated by ASM, positioning people to either buy food or inputs to grow more staples, then fewer people would go hungry, which, in turn, would meet certain targets set under SDG 2. Yet fundamentally, a mushrooming ASM sector is typically symptomatic of wider structural problems that the bulk of SDG 2 aims to remediate: a lack of investment and innovation in agricultural sectors in lower income states, and complications brought about by a protectionist global market (reduced income from agriculture, inequitable distribution of food supplies, and lower yields and wages for farmers), which has led to higher food insecurity.  3 – Health Weak to Negative Less poverty and hunger would, intuitively and hopefully, lead to improved maternal health, healthier babies and reduced infant mortality. It is difficult to see how ASM could contribute in this area, however, given its association with, firstly, hazardous releases of chemicals such as mercury and cyanide (SDG 3.9), and secondly, unhygienic work conditions that spread various diseases (SDG 3.3 & 3.4). These problems are the result of production taking place in make-shift camps populated by transient workers (TB, AIDS and communicable diseases) and causes pronounced land use change which is associated with malaria and waterborne diseases.  4 – Education Weak Those who spend any time in ASM will know that many of the people found working here do so because of their parents or they are students hoping to gather funds to pay for school fees. In locations where there is ‘free’ education (SDG 4.1), many choose to engage in ASM to generate income to pay for books, uniforms and other supplies.  5 – Gender Equity Negative No directly relatable targets to ASM. For those that could  indirectly apply, asYakovleva et al. (2022)  and others have indicated, women remain typically disenfranchised in ASM in terms of economic and social standing within, and opportunities derived from, the sector.  6 – Water & Sanitation Negative Extensive reliance upon, and wasteful use of, water, as well as diversion, pollution and sedimentation of water bodies by ASM make this a firmly negative association with SDGs 6.1, 6.3, 6.4 and 6.6  7 – Energy Not Applicable –  8 – Work & Growth Potentially Positive Potentially positive when weighed against some of the criteria tied to this SDG. The ASM sector is certainly high value added and labor-intensive and has contributed positively to economic productivity in rural areas of lower-income states (SDG 8.1). Formalization, if successful, would certainly position ASM ‘businesses’ to grow (SDG 8.3). Moreover, the sector is known for absorbing large amounts of otherwise-unemployed youth (SDG 8.6). Responsible consumption aimed at minimizing environmental degradation (SDG 8.4), ‘labor rights and promote safe and secure working environments’ (SDG 8.8) and, in the worst contexts, forced labor (SDG 8.7) is less realistic.  9 – Industry & Innovation Not Applicable –  10 – Reduced Inequalities Not Applicable Some indirect association with SDG 10.1 (income growth for bottom 40%), linked with poverty reduction, but otherwise not applicable.  11 – Sustainable Cities Not Applicable –  12 – Consumption Weak to Negative SDG 12 and its targets and indicators are not directly applicable to ASM. The sector obviously is a part of global consumption patterns, being heavily (though often informally) integrated into markets for precious, semi-precious and industrial metals and minerals. With the end consumer of ASM materials being higher-income and industrializing nations, the onus for more sustainable consumption (SDG 12.2) must come from end users (through the ‘3Rs’ – SDG 12.5) rather those based within the locations which contain the production portions of supply chains. The sector’s potential for contributing to ‘sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources’ (SDG 12.2) and ‘environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes’ (SDG 12.4) certainly do not seem promising.  13 – Climate Change Not Applicable Though ASM’s impact on land use and the environment would be of some relevance, SDG 13 is vague and policy-orientated.  14 – Life below Water Weak to Negative Use of mercury in ASM contributes to global marine contamination (SDG 14.1). Otherwise, largely not applicable against SDG indicators.  15 – Life on Land Negative ASM’s ability to cause environmental degradation has been covered extensively within the literature.  16 – Institutions Not Applicable –  17 – Partnership for Goals Not Applicable –     Table 2 Numbers employed and dependent upon ASM compared to overall population (% Pop), overall workforce (WF), agricultural workforce (AWF) and service workforce (SWF) in selected sub-Saharan African countries.

Keywords Artisanal mining  ASM  Sustainable development   Data availability No data was used for the research described in the article.   1 Introduction The original aim of this paper was to reflect on specific ways in which the artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sector might contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Its focus, however, has since shifted. It now examines, more broadly, how ASM could possibly have any connection with sustainable development or the Goals themselves. I argue that ASM cannot contribute in any meaningful way towards the SDGs by 2030. I also maintain that ASM will not contribute towards sustainable development more widely in the future. When we speak about ‘sustainability’ within the realm of extractive industries, itself an inherently un sustainable activity, we are ultimately referring to improvements in the sociological and environmental context of production, as well as patterns of consumption by manufacturers, industry and end consumers (for example, see Addison and Roe, 2018 ; Ayuk et al., 2020 ; United Nations, 2021 ). Prevailing conditions for a more desirable status quo  on these fronts are not favorable for more a sustainable ASM sector in the immediate future. I argue that this is the case because nobody really cares  about the sector at any level or in any part of its network, as much as those who admirably seek to improve its standing perhaps like to think. This, for a number of reasons which I aim to elaborate on below, marginalizes the sector in various ways and at different levels, in terms of the assistance that it would require in order to be conducted more ‘sustainably’, either according to the parameters set by the SDGs or as a more ‘sustainable’ part of the extractive industries as loosely defined above. At the global policymaking level, ASM pales in comparison, in terms of size and impacts, to other concerns that, based on current evidence, are much more pressing in terms of global sustainability agendas and policymaking. Moreover, ASM – at least in its present state – is largely a symptom, or ‘downstream’ manifestation, of limited socioeconomic development, which makes consideration of it as foundation for improving local conditions unappealing for decision-makers promoting sustainable development. At the national policymaking level in countries where ASM is most prevalent, the aforementioned concerns, along with the sector’s negative impacts, the challenges with managing it and governments’ bias towards promoting large-scale resource extraction (because of the relatively easy means through which revenue can be captured), it is routinely overlooked or ignored outright in economic and development planning. In the case of supply chains that connect ASM to markets, the vast percentage of groups and individuals buying extracted metals and minerals (either to process them or end consumers of) have repeatedly proven that they have few concerns about the conditions in which production takes place. Artisanal miners, most of whom are informal and transient, have few opportunities and little incentive to operate in a sustainable fashion, whatever this might mean, in practice. This article elaborates on these points. It does not dismiss the ASM sector as unimportant, unworthy of attention, nor incapable of operating in a more desirable or ‘sustainable’ fashion. It does, after all, employ and support millions of people across the world, is relatively well-embedded in global supply chains (at least in the case of certain minerals), tends to flourish where there are high levels of impoverishment and few alternative livelihood opportunities, and causes significant environmental destruction (see Fritz et al., 2018  for a recent overview of the sector). Any small improvement in its social and environmental performance would make it more ‘sustainable’ when benchmarked against SDG targets and indicators ( Table 1 ), albeit from an admittedly low bar. The article rather seeks to situate ASM, contextually and realistically, in among other sustainable development concerns, something which appears to have been often overlooked in academic research, grey literature and other reports.  2 Global issues and ASM: a small part of a larger picture Mining of any form is unsustainable in the word’s truest sense because it entails extraction of finite (non-renewable) resources for human consumption.1  1 This is despite the rhetoric of what many large-scale extractive companies might be trying to sell (Responsible Mining Foundation, 2020).   ASM is no exception to this finite timeline: in fact, in an illuminating first (but inevitably not the last) paper in this special issue, Pedersen et al. (2021)  consider the multiple implications for increasing exhaustion of artisanally mined gold deposits in Tanzania, and what life after mining - that has kept the worst elements of poverty and livelihood insecurity at bay - may yield in such localities. Within their mining lifetimes, ASM is associated with a range of impacts – that have been extensively covered in the associated literature – that go largely unchecked, adding to the socio-environmental burden of its production. If we accept that ASM’s contribution to a broader international sustainability agenda is open to debate, it brings us to the question that Hirons (2020)  poses: ‘[How does the sector] shape, and be shaped by, the pursuit of the SDGs’? There is, of course, and as the author rightly points out, a difference between what we might see as being  sustainable and what it is represented as  in the SDGs. Even so, ASM’s association with the more specific targets of the SDGs is, in my opinion and as Table 1  aims to highlight, weak at best and more often than not negative. From a very extensive back catalog and ongoing research into the environmental impacts of ASM (see, for example, (Emmanuel et al., 2018; Herman and O’Leary, 2014; Hilson, 2002; Kinyondo and Huggins, 2021; Macháček, 2019; Schwartz et al., 2021 , among many others), we can make a clear case for the sector being antithetical to ‘ecological’ SDGs 14 & 15 (for ‘Life Below Water’ and ‘Life on Land’, respectively). The same is true when numerous other indicators and targets are considered. It is perhaps understandable, then, that Hirons (2020) , De Haan et al. (2020)  and others, find aligning ASM with the objectives and targets of the SDGs a challenge which requires a decent measure of analytical gymnastics and overly positive perspectives if potential contributions of the sector are to be articulated. If ASM’s dynamics make it unconducive to contributing to the SDGs, are there potential pathways within international arenas for it to play a larger role in other existing or future sustainability agendas? As evidenced by more than half of a century of work (see Hilson and McQuilken, 2014 ), ASM’s trajectory towards any (externally-defined) sustainability has been and will be reliant upon the shape and level of outside (bi- and multi-lateral) assistance. Yet, pragmatically, the numbers, evidence and impetus just do not convincingly stack up to make it a priority funding area against other key global socio-environmental issues in development policymaking. In global terms, ASM is a relatively niche activity. Moreover, and as already indicated, it should – at least in its current state – be viewed as a manifestation of stymied socioeconomic development rather than an effective platform for improved social and economic (and certainly environmental) conditions. When we do see some type of intervention, the results are typically underwhelming, owing to the inappropriate approaches adopted to deliver it and failure to understand the dynamics of the ASM operations being targeted. The number of people engaged in ASM, 15–40 million worldwide with 80–150 million supported (Fritz et al., 2018 ), has been consistently creeping up, seemingly based on very little direct empirical evidence (World Bank 2019). Superficially, this seems an impressively high number. This, however, represents a fraction of the global workforce: being at the very most, 1% of an estimated 3.5 billion (ILO 2020). It is even low in many regions where the sector flourishes, such as parts of sub-Saharan Africa, where it employs 5% of the workforce at the very most ( Table 2 ). Agriculture remains the dominant source of livelihood in most countries where ASM is found in any discernable amount. Moreover, what has been lost in terms of agricultural workforce has been almost directly replaced by the growth of the services (tertiary) sector. This is with the notable exceptions of highly unstable and post-conflict settings such as DRC and Sierra Leone, respectively. These numbers for sub-Saharan Africa, which are meant to be indicative rather than definitive, do not, of course, tell the entire ASM story either here or in other regions. There are almost certainly overestimates of people directly involved in ASM: a case in point being Eritrea, where the 400,000 figure provided constitutes a quarter  of the country’s workforce. A large part of such wide degrees of inaccuracy come from the fact that the vast percentage of ASM is informal, so the estimates provided are open to wide degrees of error. Another reason is that the line between larger occupational sectors like agriculture and services (especially petty trading) on the one hand, and ASM on the other hand, is often blurred. As numerous researchers have noted, multiple intersections exist between agriculture and ASM, with erstwhile farmers and agricultural laborers involving themselves in mining seasonally, raising cash to purchase additional inputs or sending remittances back to farm-producing areas (Brugger and Zanetti, 2020; Hilson, 2016; Hilson and Garforth, 2012; Maconachie and Binns, 2007; Ofosu et al., 2020 ). The same is true of petty tradespeople who are trying to supplement their business earnings with income from mining, or students seeking to pay for their school fees (Gatsinzi and Hilson, 2022 ). That is to say, many people who report as their primary occupation, agriculture and/or services-related work, could also be involved in ASM in some capacity. Many of the figures reported, therefore, likely include individuals such as these in order for the calculated percentages to make sense. Even so, on the face of things, we are dealing with an occupation that, if our estimated figures are accurate, typically engages 2% of the population, less than 5% of the workforce (in the case of a region such as sub-Saharan Africa at least) and is almost always significantly overshadowed by other economic sectors in the context of employment. If the interconnections between ASM and other central economic sectors are as important as researchers suggest, and artisanal mining provides support to a range of other (potentially more sustainable) livelihoods, then our ability to capture these nuances must improve dramatically if sector is to have any realistic chance to be included and more effectively nurtured in policymaking. Another factor that marginalizes ASM in global policy debates on sustainability is that it is not, as far as we can reliably tell, a catalyst of national or global economic growth or development. The notable growth (prior to the onset of COVID-19) witnessed in lower to middle income countries in sub-Saharan Africa, South America and Asia with sizable ASM populations has not been due to primary resource extraction but rather secondary and (especially) tertiary sector growth (see Table 2 ). Meanwhile, reliance (economically) on primary industries and exports has not served lower income states well, failing to facilitate significant development (Correa and Kanatsouli, 2018; UNCTAD, 2019 ). The enclave-like nature of large-scale mining operations have failed to produce much in way of downstream complementary economic linkages (Ackah-Baidoo, 2020; Ferguson, 2005 ). Moreover, while it is certainly true that ASM does provide some type of ‘platform’ for diversification of livelihoods and employment (Fisher et al., 2019; Hilson and Hu, 2022 ), it also appears true that economic development associated with the sector is generally highly-localized, tied to the fortunes of those operating, with only a select few benefitting from anything other than the revenue generated from minerals and materials being extracted. That is to say, if ASM is truly an ‘engine of rural growth’ that might facilitate wider development that can be built upon (De Haan et al., 2020; Franks, 2020 ), we currently have not, as Hilson and Hu (2022)  also rightly suggest, dedicated enough time to establishing empirical evidence to support this. The materials that artisanal miners extract are predominantly made up of those that are consumed by wealthier sections of society – namely, precious materials (gold and colored gemstones, for example) – and therefore, do not have any tangibly direct contributions to development, and ultimately, sustainability, at the local level in the ways that industrial or construction minerals potentially do. The production levels attributable to ASM, which again, occurs predominantly in marginalized rural areas of the developing world, are no doubt impressive: it accounts for 20% of the global gold supply, 80% of the global sapphire supply, 20% of the global diamond supply, 25% of global tantalum and tin production, and approximately 20% of cobalt production (Fritz et al., 2018 ). The case for ASM being a significant market force in terms of ‘Development Minerals’2  2 Which the same author defines as ‘minerals and materials that are mined, processed, manufactured and used domestically in industries such as construction, manufacturing, infrastructure and agriculture’ (Franks, 2020 , p. 455).   (Franks, 2020 ), while promising, is still unclear because research on this subject is still in short supply. While it is likely that artisanal mining of important domestic fuel minerals such as coal, particularly in industrializing economies like China, are widely under-reported (Schwartz et al., 2021 ), from a global perspective, all evidence points to ASM-mined metals and minerals being mere supplements (rather than a key part of) supply networks. A possible exception to this argument comes in the form of the – as yet relatively unknown – role that ASM may play in the production of low-carbon technologies. Countries with notable amounts of ASM activities such the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Tanzania, Rwanda, South Africa, China, Brazil and Indonesia, are the locations of high concentrations of reserves of ‘technologically critical elements’ such as coltan, cobalt, lithium and graphite (Sovacool et al., 2020 ). These are used in manufacturing electric vehicles and renewable energy infrastructure (Lèbre et al., 2020 ). Surging demand and prices for such materials may well draw more people into artisanal mining who will undoubtedly be in a position to extract them, whether new entrants to the sector or individuals who have transitioned from prospecting for more traditional precious metals and gemstones. Could transitioning to a low carbon future yield more ‘sustainable’ outcomes, developmentally, for ASM? There seems to be some hope that artisanal operators could carve a niche for themselves in delivering these increasingly important and valuable metals and minerals to world markets (World Bank 2020). While this is an emerging area in need of research, when reflecting on previous experiences, and in line with arguments presented in the sections that follow, I am not optimistic. Much will depend upon artisanal mining being seen and treated as a legitimate enterprise. But for this to happen, the process of formalization (discussed below) will need to be successfully executed by host governments and supported effectively across global supply chains. A much more likely scenario is that concerns around the ‘sustainability’, transparency and ethics of supply chains for minerals (and perhaps even their scale and reliability) used in low-carbon technologies will spawn a new wave of large-scale (presumably, typically foreign-owned) mining operations, much like what is currently unfolding across the DRC. Host governments will, of course, be happy to allocate vast swathes of land currently being worked by informal or quasi-legal artisanal mines, and embrace opportunities to secure easy windfalls. This will form an almost carbon-copy repeat of the ‘large-scale bias’ that Hilson (2019)  describes for the last half century across Sub-Saharan Africa, and has been replicated elsewhere in the world. Similarly, downstream industries and consumers will prefer a more-easily traceable and ‘reputable’ source. It is seen as a preferred option to dealing with hundreds, if not thousands, of small independent operators. Accordingly, while artisanal mining will certainly continue to proliferate around the fringes of their large-scale counterparts and supply a decent proportion of global markets, the sector is highly unlikely to factor into any strategic international decisions made around balancing future ongoing demand for these increasingly ‘essential’ materials against sustainability. Perhaps more importantly, it is challenging to factor ASM within a broad global systems perspective that addresses the urgent sustainability needs that will shape the coming century. I have already made the case that ASM, in its current form, has a large weight of evidence for its adverse environmental impacts and limited evidence for its socioeconomic benefits. In terms of dealing with the concerns surrounding some of the more fundamental human needs our time - poverty and food security - and international strategies to meet them, attempting to align ASM as being capable of tackling them could appear to be relatively shortsighted and even slightly cynical. Yes, ASM certainly plays a notable, and likely under-quantified, role in alleviating poverty, livelihoods vulnerability and general socioeconomic hardship in many contexts (Hilson, 2009; Justice et al., 2017; Laing and Moonsammy, 2021; Schwartz et al., 2021 , among others). It might, therefore, help meet defined SDG targets on poverty and hunger by the end of this decade. But – and to reiterate a point already made – it is also justifiable to suggest that the sector is ultimately a symptom of such forces and not a truly sustainable (i.e. ongoing) escape from them. ASM, which again, is unsustainable , owing to it extracting finite resources, flourishes because of poverty and insecurity, or becomes a preferred income-earning option only when other livelihoods make it a ‘last resort’ (Sippl 2018). Logically, then, the sustainable  outcome is to reduce or eliminate the conditions which have fueled the growth of the activity in the first instance. We can, therefore, perhaps somewhat forgive international development agencies and national policymakers for overlooking ASM – the symptom - in favor of attempting to address the root cause. On the subject of food security, the justification for this line of thinking becomes even more tangible. Significant structural changes within global agricultural systems will be required to feed our growing world population and prevent food insecurity (FAO, 2017, 2020 ; Gladek et al., 2017 ), especially in regions with notable ASM activity, such as sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia – areas of the world which are anticipated to experience significant population growth during this century (Ghosh, 2020 ). If a failing agricultural sector has fueled the growth of the ASM sector (Hilson and Garforth, 2012 ), why would we concentrate on reforming the latter rather than the former as a pathway to sustainability? When used in the context of agriculture, “unsustainable” is typically in reference to its inability to feed a growing population, as well as how it causes land use change and degradation (Borrelli et al., 2017; Hassan et al., 2005; Hertwich, 2010 ). Here, again, ASM is trumped in terms of its international importance. Environmentally, the negative impacts of the sector – deforestation, topsoil removal, sedimentation of water bodies, and mercury and cyanide contamination (e.g. Barenblitt et al., 2021 ; Caballero Espejo et al., 2018 ; Emmanuel et al., 2018 ; Esdaile and Chalker, 2018 ; Macháček, 2019 ; Marshall et al., 2020 ; Rajaee et al., 2015 ; Siqueira-Gay and Sánchez, 2021 ) – are, indeed, eye-catching. But although it certainly contributes in some capacity, ASM’s impact on planetary health is negligible in comparison to agriculture and forestry, which are responsible for far more significant land degradation (Borrelli et al., 2017; Curtis et al., 2018; Mirzabaev et al., 2016; Pendrill et al., 2019 ). Moreover, ASM is not a leading source of the pollution and environmental contamination identified in many of the ‘ecosystem services’-orientated SDGs (SDGs 6 and 12–15) and which is the focal point of many sustainability debates more widely. This is the case even for particularly problematic contaminants such as mercury (and increasingly cyanide), both of which have received a significant amount of coverage in academic, donor and public spheres. The fact that ASM remains the largest anthropogenic source of mercury (Obrist et al., 2018 ) is certainly concerning but is a rather small concern overall when compared to problems linked to other global contaminants to air, water and land. With all of the aforementioned environmental impacts, we again have large degrees of uncertainty around ASM’s role. In global and regional assessments of changes in land use and ‘quality’ (e.g. degradation), artisanal mining operations are often lumped together with agriculture and forestry. This is partly the result of relying on data generated via remote sensing and geospatial exercises. It is also partly pragmatic, as artisanal mining often occurs alongside agriculture, as well as going hand in hand with deforestation. Moreover, although we have an extensive catalog of research documenting the effects of mercury use in artisanal gold mining operations, we still do not (and may never) have a clear idea of the sector’s level of consumption and emissions of the metal, owing to the clandestine nature of its supply chain and the informality of the sector itself. Finally, despite publication of some key studies, the environmental impacts of other notable types of artisanal mining, for example tin, remain largely understudied. All of the above is to say that if we wish for the global artisanal mining sector to have a seat at the table alongside other global environmental concerns, and be allocated the time and resources within international policymaking agendas needed to facilitate it becoming more ‘sustainable’, then we need to be in the position to more readily and reliably quantify and demonstrate the case for the sector, akin to other areas of ecological and environmental concern and their associated research. If ASM is not, then, particularly high on the international development policymaking agenda, we (as those with vested interests) might grudgingly understand, given the arguments above. Another less tangible but almost undeniably significant aspect of ASM’s relationship to global sustainability agendas must also surely come from the lack of progress made with previous interventions. The sector has, sporadically and in different guises, come into the focus of international institutions such as the United Nations, World Bank and other bilateral actors (Hilson and McQuilken, 2014 ). Specific focuses over time have included mapping ASM’s dynamics and quantifying its impacts, examining pathways of mercury contamination, articulating the links between the sector and conflict, ‘Fairtrade’ and ‘ethical’ mining, and ‘Development Minerals’. The push to formalize ASM (Hilson et al., 2018 ), across a swathe of countries in line with the Minamata Convention on Mercury3   3 The Minamata Convention on Mercury is an international treaty aimed at reducing the trade, use and emissions of mercury, which entered into force in 2017. Article 7 of the Convention requires signatory countries with ‘more than significant quantities’ of artisanal gold mining to draft and implement National Action Plans with strategies for reducing emissions from ASM.   represents the latest notable phase of attempting to deal with the specter of social ills and environmental damage that many associate with the sector. What we can firmly say and see is that all previous interventions have had next to no effect on the fundamental dynamics and practices of ASM (Clifford, 2014; Fritz et al., 2018; Hilson and McQuilken, 2014 ). If one visits an artisanal mine site in most parts of the world, it looks almost identically to how it did two decades ago, and operates similarly. This is with the notable caveat that, over time, some accumulation and investment of capital has occurred in certain places and contexts (Hilson and Hu, 2022 ), and machinery such as excavators, generators, pumps and grinders becoming more widely available through the entry of Chinese imports into these markets (Crawford et al., 2016 ).4  4 The availability of more affordable machinery to extract deeper lying deposits is almost undoubtedly something which has extended the operating lifespan of various artisanal operations (e.g. see Pedersen et al., 2021 )   When we consider the well-observed socio-environmental associations of ASM, this lack of change alone carries negative connotations for the sector contributing to sustainable development. This lack of ‘progress’ here is a symptom of the ‘development’ exercise, especially for more niche concerns such as ASM. But it also has ramifications for its continued place within sustainable development policymaking, with issues that do not yield results for donors being far less likely to receive ongoing support. Formalization, as the latest panacea of ASM’s woes, is highly likely to follow the same trajectory as previous and ongoing interventions. Artisanal mining, along with other informal sector activities and ‘livelihood diversification’, was the ‘gig economy’ long before this phrase was used in reference to similar aspects of labor and economic fragmentation in Western economies. In addition to more conceptual and systematic critiques of formalization offered by the likes of Geenen (2012)  and Verbrugge and Besmanos (2016) , it is also pertinent to ponder how attempting to get people to formalize in a sector where most participants of the workforce live almost exclusively hand to mouth, would rather be doing something else, and often leave when and if they can, is likely to practically be approached. We might also ask what ASM practitioners think they are going to do more effectively than, and differently to, past efforts made to regulate other informal sector activities that employ a large percentage of the populations of lower-income states (Bromley and Wilson, 2018 ; IMF, 2021 ; Kus, 2010 ). The many attempts made to formalize ASM over the years (Hilson et al., 2017; Maconachie and Hilson, 2011; Marshall and Veiga, 2017; Van Bockstael, 2014; Veiga and Marshall, 2019 ) have fallen considerably short. In fact, as Hilson et al. (2022)  document, Ghana’s pledge to formalize ASM has now entered its fourth decade , and like elsewhere (e.g. Maconachie and Conteh, 2021 ; Maconachie and Hilson, 2011 ; Van Bockstael, 2014 ; Veiga and Marshall, 2019 ), has been hobbled by a lot of bureaucracy and a lack of resources. As the latest phase of multilateral policymaking intervention aimed at getting to grips with ASM, it is likely that a lot rides on the outcome of renewed efforts at formalizing the sector. Should they prove unsuccessful (again), this would provide further unfortunate evidence of ASM’s unsuitability within broader sustainability efforts and raise even more questions over the viability of channeling any future funding into attempting to remediate its undesirable social and environmental outcomes. When judged against existing evidence, ASM is an activity that is overshadowed on numerous fronts by other concerns deemed more pressing by international policymakers. And given the marred history of engaging with the ASM sector, they are probably justified in thinking that they can achieve more tangible results elsewhere.  3 The ASM sector at a national level: easy to ignore The international policymaking landscape, of course, strongly influences the design of national frameworks, domestic legislation and the direction of assistance for ASM. The latter includes the extension services, development interventions and funding referenced above. As was also previously stated, most countries with sizable ASM sectors have, in fact, seemingly relied upon external support to assist with shifts in their management of ASM, whether it be legislative changes, training exercises, or technological support (Hilson and Clifford, 2010a; Hilson and McQuilken, 2014; Veiga and Fadina, 2020 ). There is nothing in theory that would prevent individual governments from proactively adopting more effective and ‘user friendly’ approaches toward formalizing, regulating and supporting artisanal mining: laws and statutes can be changed at any time in democratic states. Yet, prevailing attitudes and assistance towards ASM is almost universally inadequate, uncoordinated and/or an afterthought. Outside of finite and sporadic injections of donor funding targeting ASM, there appears to be little political appetite for addressing the sector’s ills, and a diminished confidence that anything actually could. This situation has shown little sign of changing in the previous four decades and is unlikely to alter significantly in the future. We might, in fact, be reluctant to blame governments, the agencies dedicated to assisting ASM and indeed rural communities themselves for being skeptical about the feasibility of improving the sector, given the flawed and sporadic nature of previous support-related interventions. We might also excuse the relatively stagnant nature of approaches towards ASM in most countries where it occurs by the fact that (as with at an international scale), it is a relatively confined activity that has seemingly shown that it does not fit into macro-level socioeconomic and development roadmaps and visions. Typically, one will certainly not find ASM as anything other than a footnote, if mentioned at all, in national sustainable development strategies. This is the case even in dedicated industry frameworks like the Africa Mining Vision  (Hilson, 2020; Ushie, 2017 ).  Nearly every country with significant amount of ASM does, however, have at least some  dedicated legislation, albeit varying widely in comprehensiveness from location to location. But anybody who has interacted with the relevant national authorities mandated with implementing such laws and codes will testify to the fact that such departments are, without exception, inadequately resourced and therefore unable to fulfill their everyday mandates. This is asides from pursuing additional activities – such as formalization - viewed as necessary to facilitate a more sustainable artisanal mining sector. Recognizing such ‘inadequate operational resources’, Childs (2008)  and Clifford (2014)  also make the point that the negative relationship between miners and authorities is a self-perpetuating cycle. Artisanal miners do not pay taxes or fees and have little incentive to conduct themselves formally (where they would, presumably, pay taxes) because they receive very little assistance from the authorities. These authorities are, in turn, underfunded and unable to offer adequate assistance because they are seen as supporting an activity that does not pay back. What certainly doesn’t aid existing limitations in dealing with ASM at a national level is the legacy of it being easily dismissed or spun politically to distract from its underlying roots of poverty and livelihood marginalization. The sector’s association with environmental damage, encroachment on to agricultural and protected lands, and informality are common sources of condemnation (Tschakert, 2009; Tschakert and Singha, 2007 ) and political gesturing, even in cases where policymakers and scholars call for more nuanced tact towards the sector. For example, the ban on the ‘menace’ that is ASM in Ghana under the auspices of environmental protection, complete with military enforcement (Eduful et al., 2020; Hilson and Maconachie, 2020 ), is an excellent recent example of this in action. In most countries, prevailing political narratives about ASM are neither indicative of a proactive attitude towards the sector nor conducive to it being accepted in a formal sense. A final factor contributing to this problem is the policy treatment given to large -scale mining, which occurs in virtually every country where its small-scale counterpart is present. Large-scale mining operations provide a reliable source of revenue for governments, in return for little political accountability. As Hilson (2019)  examines in detail, a ‘bias’ towards large-scale mining operations and the substantial windfalls that they offer governments in places such as sub-Saharan Africa (e.g. Sauerwein, 2020 ) and Asia (e.g. Spiegel, 2016 ) has resulted in ASM – as well as other economic activities such as agriculture – being consistently marginalized. This bias has, unsurprisingly, resulted those parties engaged in it receiving preferential treatment when it has come to land allocation and government attention. This is despite the rather ambiguous association of large mining operations with short and longer-term socioeconomic development. We could also add that in most contexts, the existence of legislation and regulations pertaining to ASM in the first instance, and then most of their subsequent evolution, amendments and associated actions were not made with the sector specifically in mind. Rather, they have arisen either as a byproduct of approaches and policy packages focusing predominantly on large-scale mining or externally (multilaterally or bilaterally) funded exercises addressing environmental (e.g. mercury: see Clifford, 2014 ; McDaniels et al., 2010 ; Veiga et al., 2014 ) or socioeconomic (e.g. the current push for formalization mentioned above) concerns within ASM. As is the case at the international level, at the national level, ASM is, therefore, easily – and perhaps justifiably – overlooked as a priority area. It has been condemned for its environmental impacts and the ‘refusal’ of its operators to conduct themselves more responsibly, obscuring the fact that the level of assistance allocated to the sector remains wholly inadequate. The sector has been further marginalized by governments, and fails to receive the necessary support due to the bias shown toward large-scale mining. At the national level, it would also appear that nobody really cares that much about ASM.  4 Markets and consumers: all the power but no responsibility While most ASM initiatives and interventions have targeted miners directly, it is economic actors and consumers directly and indirectly associated with the activity elsewhere in wider networks who have the true power to act. A genuine awareness of, and unwavering demand for, artisanally-extracted minerals and metals, at the (very relative, considering market share) expense of large, industrial mining operations, produced under optimal social and environmental conditions and which are produced paying workers fairly, could be seismic in driving positive reform in ASM, specifically in a more ‘sustainable’ direction (as defined at the outset of the paper). Although, as noted above, ASM as a source of domestically utilized ‘development minerals’ (see Franks, 2020 ) is an interesting – albeit, under-researched – idea, the vast percentage of artisanally mined commodities are high value-to-weight materials, and destined for external markets. As the global report by Fritz et al. (2018)  highlights, aside from tin, which artisanal operators produce an impressive 25% of – the ASM sector is almost entirely absent as a source of ‘traditional’ industrial metals such as iron, lead and copper. Conversely, it is a significant contributor to global supply of valuable commodities such as gemstones and gold (and, as mentioned above, potentially  for ‘technologically critical materials’ in the near future). Efforts made to address undesirable work conditions in ASM, including the US Dodd-Frank Act that targets the ‘3Ts’ (tungsten, tin and tantalum),5  5 Which have become entwined with conflict in places like the DRC.   the EU’s Regulation on Conflict Minerals that cover the three aforementioned metals as well as gold, initiatives such as ‘Fair Trade’ or ‘ethical’ gold, and the Kimberley Process and Diamond Development Initiative for diamonds, are all laudable. They have helped raise awareness of production and supply chain issues within Western consumer circles in terms of demand for environmentally and socially responsibly sourced products. A 2019 survey by the World Gold Council suggested that 70% of gold jewelry buyers said they would like to purchase pieces that are ‘produced ethically’. The Responsible Jewelry Council (RJC), for instance, one of the largest industry bodies which certifies member according to commitment to responsible business practices, had estimated combined annual sales of US$66.8 billion in 2017 (RJC 2017). But this example represents less than a quarter of the global jewelry market, which was valued at US$278.5 billion in 2018. Moreover, ‘ethical’ is often a synonym for avoidance of  rather than proactive engagement with  – in this context – ASM producers. Wanting to avoid supply chains that might contain minerals that were extracted by artisanal operators, many manufacturers of luxury goods in Western countries appear to be moving towards using recycled metals and lab-grown stones. For instance, Pandora, the world’s largest producer of jewelry, announced it was switched to 100% recycled gold by 2025. If unable to secure recycled product, these organizations source materials extracted at large-scale, Western-owned and operated mines. Existing and emerging responsible sourcing efforts are, in their current state at least, unlikely to have much overall impact on the sustainability of international ASM networks, for various reasons. First, regardless of the ethical parameters surrounding production, there will always be demand and supply routes for artisanally mined commodities. Shifting high value-to-weight gold, diamonds, colored gemstones and coltan via illicit networks is commonplace for a sector that is largely-informal (Smith, 2020; Wakenge et al., 2018 ).6  6 In many cases, it has been found that the practical implementation of such initiatives actually worsened conditions for miners and communities within ASM regions (Hilson and Clifford, 2010b ; Rush and Rozell, 2017 ; Stoop et al., 2018 ).   The list of potential buyers seems endless: for example, a Reuters investigation found that, in 2016, some US$15 billion worth of gold was imported by the United Arab Emirates from African states, a figure representing a US$4 billion (677 ton) disparity from the official export records (Lewis et al., 2019 ). Moreover, as large multinationals such as Apple7  7 US Securities and Exchange Commission. Apple Inc. Specialized Disclosure Report for 2021. https://www.apple.com/supplier-responsibility/pdf/Apple-Conflict-Minerals-Report.pdf. Accessed August 17th 2022.   (to take just one example, see Sodhi and Tang, 2019  for more) have discovered, even with the best intentions, attempts to trace and verify the source of various metal and mineral refiners, across the global networks in which they are embedded, are largely-futile. Refined gold, tin, silver or coltan could come from anywhere; and this is the case of a company which has been relatively proactive in attempting to make its supply chains more transparent. The widespread adoption of corporate social responsibility has come about not only to meet a wider remit of legal requirements (such as those discussed above), but also in the economic belief that most people actually care about social and environmental conditions of production beyond sporadic outcries linked to exposes and reports. This belief is typically measured in terms of surveying opinion on different aspects. These, akin to the statistics on ethical jewelry given above, have shown a notable amount of consumer interest in sustainable and ethical corporate practices. For example, the consumer marketing firm Clutch8  8 Clutch Branding & PR Report: ‘How Corporate Social Responsibility Influences Buying Decisions’. January 9th 2019. https://clutch.co/pr-firms/resources/how-corporate-social-responsibility-influences-buying-decisions. Accessed August 17th 2022.   indicates that, for US markets at least, environmentally and socially proactive attributes of a company are, in fact, a more important consideration than price. Among the companies it surveyed, 70% of Gen Xers (and 60% of the total surveyed group) stated they would be willing to boycott brands that adopt practices or positions they are at odds with. Similar views appear to be present in emerging consumer markets as well, as Chaudhary et al. (2020)  and Kaushik and Pandley (2020)  suggest in the case of India, Zhang and Ahmad (2021)  report for Pakistan, and Ramasamy and Yeung (2009)  for China. However, as Kraus et al. (2021)  point out, although there is ‘a theoretical  connection between CSR initiatives and positive consumer reaction’, a reliable empirical  connection to actual buying behavior suffers from ‘a lack of material relevance’ (emphasis added). Growing global demand for commodities the precious metals and stones which ASM operators concentrate on extracting is not, however, driven by increasingly vigilant Western markets. It is rather a result of developments in countries such as the UAE (especially Dubai), as well as China and India, both of which have large, emerging industrial and manufacturing sectors, and consumer markets. According to the European Commission’s Competence Centre on Foresight,9  9 European Commission: ‘Developments and Forecasts of Growing Consumerism’. https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/foresight/topic/growing-consumerism/more-developments-relevant-growing-consumerism_en. Accessed August 17th, 2022.   Asian states will account for 88% of the additional projected 1.3 billion entries to the global ‘middle class’ between 2021 and 2030. This figure has already swelled from 1.9 billion since 2009, surpassing middle class populations in Western economies and with spending power worth tens of trillions of dollars. Moreover, according to the investment firm Sprott, which specializes in market analysis of precious metal markets, both countries display a stronger ‘intent to spend’ on jewelry (which accounts for half of global demand for gold) than on many other discretionary items.10  10 Sprott: ‘Demand for Precious Metals Jewelry Runs Deep’. https://sprott.com/media/3235/sprott-silver-report-demand-for-precious-metals-jewelry.pdf. Accessed August 17th, 2022.   While finished jewelry imported from Western markets may increasingly not be fabricated using product sourced directly from artisanal operators, both China and India were nevertheless active in importing their own gold. The two countries were the third and fourth largest importers of gold, respectively, in 2019, accounting for close to 25% of the world’s imports of the metal that year. This product is not always sourced from ‘sustainable’ or reputable sources: some 20% (US$ 8.11 billion of US$ 41.5 billion total11  11 OEC Profiles: ‘Gold in China’. https://oec.world/en/profile/bilateral-product/gold/reporter/chn?redirect=true. Accessed August 17th, 2022.  ) of China’s gold imports came from Switzerland, and over half of India’s (gold) imports were also from Switzerland or the aforementioned UAE (US$ 16.5 billion and US$ 3.29 billion, respectively, of US$33.8 billion total12  12 OEC Profiles: ‘Gold in India’. https://oec.world/en/profile/bilateral-product/gold/reporter/ind. Accessed August 17th, 2022.  ). Moreover, the UAE is reportedly one of the largest exporters of gold to Switzerland; the origins of this gold are rather dubious (Ummel, 2020 ). China exported just under a quarter of the world’s tantalum/coltan in the same year13  13 OEC Profiles: ‘Tantalum’. https://oec.world/en/profile/hs/tantalum. Accessed August 17th, 2022.   and imports pretty much the entire national jadeite production of Myanmar (Sadan and Lawn Dan, 2021 ), a country with a less than stellar social and political record. From the above, and the numbers of refiners and suppliers ‘removed’ each year from supply chains courtesy of shifts to more ‘responsible’ sourcing by companies such as Apple (in its case, 148 between 2009 and 2020), it is safe to assume that countries with large industrial bases do not exercise much discretion when it comes to sourcing their raw materials. It is also unlikely that many of end users in Western and emerging markets really question, or indeed give up on trying to understand the dynamics of infinitely complex global supply chains, the origins of their products and the conditions under which they were extracted/produced. That is to say, and as I have argued at the international and national policymaking levels, there is a lack of care from companies sourcing and end consumers about how the materials that go into their products are derived for a handful of reasons: responsible sourcing makes up a minor part of a shifting global consumer market for products that might contain artisanally extracted materials: responsible sourcing has increasingly, perhaps justifiably given tangled global supply chains, become a strategy of avoiding rather than actually engaging with ASM sources: and evidence for companies and consumers actually being concerned about where their materials come from (via changes in behavior) is scant. This rather sad state of affairs dictates that networks linking the ASM sector with the global economy will continue operate as they are, with exploitation of typically impoverished workers, poor working conditions, environmental detrimental practices, and informality being pervasive: there is no hard economic incentive or push for change.  5 Conclusions: implications for the ASM ‘Community’ This paper has argued artisanal mining will not contribute to meeting sustainable development agendas because most people do not ‘care’ about the sector, for many different reasons. I suggested from the outset that the sector certainly bears very little relation to the predominant sustainability blueprint of the SDGs. More broadly, when the sector is viewed from a holistic, broad, long-term perspective which discussions around sustainability should force us to adopt, it is also rather difficult to see where ASM fits (if it does or can at all) into such debates and what the sustainable ‘answers’ are to its most challenging aspects, existing as it does as part of a complex set of forces acting at different scales. At the international stage, policymakers are grappling with some of the most alarming environmental and socioeconomic challenges in human existence. Despite its association with impoverishment and livelihood instability, all available evidence indicates that ASM does not count amongst these challenges. In fact, I have made the case that a broad-based approach towards sustainability, including tangible progress in achieving many of the targets linked to the SDGs, would justifiably bypass  ASM and concentrate on addressing the root causes of poverty and livelihood instability that drives the activity in the first place. Similar arguments often emerge on a country level in low-income, mineral-rich states, as ASM again does not align with the broad-based goals of sustainable development strategies that target areas like agriculture, which dominates employment and is a key consideration for food security. More cynically, as a niche activity, ASM has been easy to ignore or even attack, even while promoting large-scale resource extraction. Yet just as the conditions that have created the ‘supply’ increase (numbers involved and levels of production) in artisanal mining are linked to wider socioeconomic, political and environmental dynamics, interconnected conditions of ‘demand’ also do not occur in a vacuum. Despite some commendable efforts made to raise awareness and counteract more questionable supply chain characteristics, there has been a consistent source of buyers for artisanally mined materials, regardless of the potential social and environmental impacts associated with their production. The emergence of burgeoning consumer markets in middle income countries – which has chronologically matched the growth of ASM over the last four decades – that have very few qualms about the origins of the raw materials found within the goods they purchase is matched by the apparent little regard that most people still exhibit in traditional Western markets for the same type of items, or indeed their inability to act more ‘responsibly’ even if they wished owing to the increasing opacity of global supply chains. There is, consequently, very little pressure to improve the social and environmental performance (the sustainability) of the sector from the part of the global connections to ASM that would generally seem to have the power to enact tangible change: we as end consumers. While external economic incentives would perhaps carry the most theoretical influence, thus far in its history, the onus has overwhelmingly been on donors, development agencies and governments, usually in line with academic researchers and practitioners, to facilitate improvements in the ASM sector. On this, we must confront a rather jaded track record: the impact of previous interventions aimed at supporting and/or formalizing ASM have, for the most part, been wholly underwhelming. This is a result of an interrelated mixture of: the types of approaches pursued, which were often imposed, technocratic, short-lived and limited in scope: the fundamental dynamics of the sector, which is informal, highly transient and inescapably complex: and a lack of political will on the part of governments to properly implement existing and emerging policies. As suggested above, the push for formalization is likely to be a litmus test for whether our ability to manage any of these parameters have improved in the fifty or so years since the ASM sector caught the attention of donors and practitioners. The assessment provided above is, admittedly, rather bleak. Yet I have attempted throughout to tease out areas for ASM researchers and advocates to cling to. Using the word ‘caring’ (or ‘not caring’) has been useful, semantically, to guide a broad-based critique of various elements of the sector and surrounding forces. It can certainly be suggested to literally  apply in various contexts. But there is also a difference between not caring and not knowing . There remain many things that we don’t know or can’t readily quantify about the global ASM sector. Actual numbers involved was a very clear example given at the outset of the paper. Our knowledge of ASM is many places where it occurs is, in fact, still fundamentally lacking. Can we prove that mining really is a platform for wealth creation? As Hilson and Hu’s (2022)  contribution to this issue begins to explore, can ASM – if properly nurtured – eventually led onto less resource-reliant, sustainable livelihoods? It is also highly likely we need to provide international policymakers with more comprehensive and reliable data on the sector as a whole. Generally, ASM research been good at localized context but less than comprehensive at an international scale. For example, what percent of global land use change (from agriculture or forest) is ASM accountable for? Our ability to provide broad-based data for the sector will need to change14  14 And be taken on by people much cleverer than myself   if it is to be successfully considered and worked into sustainability agendas that are predicated on global trends and issues. What we do  know in the meantime is that, yes, ASM is not ultimately sustainable; and, yes, it is associated with social and environmental ills. Yet we should also know that the most negative aspects that currently afflict the activity – precarious working conditions for little pay for the average worker, operations that are poorly regulated and reliant upon debilitated support agencies, pervasive environmental degradation, and supply chains complicit in perpetuating these conditions – need not exist. Continued advocacy can potentially make inroads here. I would suggest that the vast majority of people are not aware of the scale of and dynamics underpinning the social and environmental challenges ‘we’, as interested parties, commonly associate with ASM. The hope, of course, is that, with increased visibility within the civic imagination, the pressure on international policymakers, national governments and private companies to do better increases, whether in Western or emerging markets. Combined with an improved ability to demonstrate the interlinkages (where applicable) of ASM with wider concerns, we can at least have some hope of pressing for improvements in the social and environmental conditions with the sector that would constitute a greater degree of sustainability.
