                  The United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agenda has been hailed as the most comprehensive and integrated framework for addressing the twin challenges of global environmental change and global development. This all-encompassing framework has provided a unique intersection for inter- and trans-disciplinary critical research and scholarship aimed at interrogating and improving public policy. Nevertheless, there are crucial premises underpinning the agenda that have rarely been interrogated or subjected to explicit scrutiny. As a consequence, much of the analytical work focusing on the SDGs, their targets, indicators, and the interrelations between these, replicates these premises with problematic implications. We demonstrate that the approach manifested in the SDGs aligns strongly with Ecological Modernization Theory (EMT). It is on the basis of EMT that an integration of ‘environmental’ and ‘developmental’ objectives (goals) is proposed and advanced. We explicate this through a close analysis especially of the four explicitly environment-focussed goals (12, 13, 14, and 15), their “Means of Implementation”, and their overall integration with Goal 17. We apprehend the problems of EMT through this analysis. As we show, there are alternatives to the EMT approach to the environment-and-development constellation. Presenting it as inevitable, and accepting its premises thus turns out to be ultimately an ideological choice. Our analysis of the environment-and-development link under the SDGs makes such choices intelligible, and their implications clearer, irrespective of ideological preferences. Taking these critical insights into account more centrally is imperative for better understanding and responding to the evolving intersections between science, technology, ecology, and social, economic and political change.

Keywords Environment & development  SDGs  Ecological Modernization Theory  Modernization Theory  Means of implementation  Politics of global development    1 Introduction The UN’s SDG initiative has been widely hailed as the most comprehensive global framework for addressing the twin challenges of environmental change and development (Antonio Guterres, Foreword, UN, 2019: 2 ). Since its inception during the final phase of the Millennium Development Goals round, and its subsequent adoption in 2015, it has served as the key frame of reference for international, national, and local research and policy communities (Sachs et al., 2019; McGowan et al., 2019; Nerini et al., 2019 ).1  1 The case for the transformative scope of the SDGs made in such research works from the uninterrogated premise that the SDG Agenda is desirable, and its objectives achievable. For example, Sachs et al focus on how to realize  the implementation of the SDGs, by calling for six transformations, with the aim of underlining intrinsic interconnections between the Goals. However, an approach like theirs fails to appreciate that the SDG Agenda is premised on a Means of Implementation (MoI) Strategy which is integrally built into it. The link between these MoI, and the problems which they think can be solved through the Agenda, is more complicated, and has more pernicious implications than they assume, as we show below.   Increasing concern over climate change, biodiversity loss, bio-sphere integrity more generally, rising inequality and social exclusion, as well as political and economic volatility, have only heightened expectations about the potential of the SDGs to turn things around (see for example Nerini et al., 2019 ). When viewed as a global governance mechanism, the SDGs are indeed unique: The level of support, both inter-governmental and non-governmental in reaching agreement on the agenda has been unprecedented (UN, 2019a, 2019b ). It has also provided a new lease of life to the use of the concepts of sustainability and sustainable development. The recovery of these concepts has been accomplished with the help of the language of goals, targets and indicators that supplements concrete expectations about governance performance and outcomes. This much more tangible conceptualization of sustainability and sustainable development is given additional texture by the differentiation under each Goal between ‘outcome’ targets, and ‘means of implementation’ targets. Intuitively, this congeals with the well-rehearsed distinction known from practical reasoning between ‘ends’ and ‘means’: Both are different logically, but nevertheless co-determine better or worse outcomes. Such features support the general sense of comprehensiveness and inclusiveness for the SDGs, and the pitch towards a ‘constructive’ universalism that has been noted by some commentators (Long, 2015; Scott & Lucci, 2015 ). The SDGs have nevertheless been subjected to critical analytical attention, whether from science and science-based advise, or from social science perspectives (indicatively, Bartram et al., 2018 ; Bhardwaj et al., 2019; Boas et al., 2016, Wanner, 2015 ). Some of this work has engaged specifically with questions over the coherence between specific goals, targets and indicators (Rai et al., 2019; Satterthwaite & Dithal, 2019; Battersby, 2017; Weber, 2017; Weber, 2020 ). Others have subjected the SDG agenda to a more general critical review from the perspective of established research frameworks in critical development studies and political economy (indicatively, Weber, 2014; Sexsmith & McMichael, 2015; Gabay & Ilcan, 2017; Winkler & Satterthwaite, 2017; Suliman, 2017 ). Perhaps surprisingly, however, there are fewer than expected studies focusing specifically on close analyses of goals, targets and indicators with an eye to cycling such analyses back to the overall agenda. Even fewer have explicitly  undertaken to look at the SDGs through the lens of the environment-and-development link.2  2 There are, of course, quite a few studies aimed at criticizing the SDGs for short-comings with regard to this complex; typically, though, they are advanced from particular perspectives: not enough measures directed at environmental protection or conservation (indicatively, Spangenberg, 2017 ; Singh et al., 2018 ); critical identification of individual goals and sectors as virtual ‘stand alone’ concerns (indicatively, Bartram et al., 2018 ); concerns over relative or absolute priorities among the goals (indicatively, Biggeri et al., 2019 ); or considerations of the contributions of the SDGs to cementing imbalances and inequalities in burden-sharing over environment-and-development issues (indicatively, Deacon, 2016 ).   And there is a notable silence around the significance and effects of the “Means of Implementation (MoI)”, whether as expressed in the specific Implementation Goal (17), MoI targets under each of the other 16 Goals, or associated indicators. The lack of engagement with the MoI component of the SDGs comes in two forms, either by way of tacit  omission as in Sachs et al. (2019) , or by way of an explicit  setting aside of it, as for example in Le Blanc (2015) .3  3 The tendency to read, interpret, and assess the SDGs without considering the architectural  function of Goal 17, and the reach of its MoI implications, is again on display in exemplary fashion in Singh et al. (2018) ; see p. 225. The study presents a cross-factor analysis approach for a rapid assessment framework for determining “co-benefits and trade-offs among SDGs”, but excludes Goal 17, or any explicit engagment with the embedded MoI targets and indicators under each goal. For an exception to this general trend, see Weber (2014, 2017) .   The four more prominently environmentally  focused goals of the SDGs have received attention at best independently from either one another, or  the integrative aspects of the SDGs which are crucially articulated, as we show, through Goal 17. This is the case, for instance, in studies on the prospects of maintaining oceanic eco-systems integrity (Goal 14) that do not factor in the significance of Goal 15 objectives and related issues (terrestrial eco-systems) in conjunction with Goal 2 (ending hunger), and the implementation logics for all of them  expressed in Goal 17 (indicatively, Singh et al., 2018 ). Similar cases can be construed for example with regard to Goal 6 (water and sanitation), its correlation with health concerns (Goal 3), marine eco-systems (Goal 14), and Goal 17, as well as the latter’s “localized” cognate implementation targets under each of the goals (indicatively, consider Bartram et al. (2018) .4  4 Bartram et al. (2018)  focus entirely on Goal 6, and the MoIs ‘localized’ under that goal, with only a generic reference to Goal 17 as “how the SDGs will be achieved" (1). That SDG 17 effectively mandates  (by way of the tie-in with WTO agreements and objectives) the privatization of water and sanitation infrastructure and service delivery is overlooked, as well as how MoIs in related Goals with flow-on effects from and to Goal 6 operate with similar implications.   In what follows below, we closely examine the four explicit environmental goals (cognisant of the fact that all  SDGs have environmental implications). A close reading and content analysis of these four, and an immanent critique of how they are conceptualized, prepares the ground for our analysis. We inquire into what makes these goals cohere from the perspective of the objective of integrating ‘environment’ and ‘development’ concerns through the SDG agenda. We demonstrate that the core premises of this integration converge on axiomatic claims that are recognizably associated with Ecological Modernization Theory (EMT). This becomes exceedingly clear in the context of our unpacking of the policy priorities of the approach in general, and of how the ‘environment and development’ link in particular is construed. As we show, these priorities are expressed through the MoI components under both, Goal 17 itself, and in the “localized” expressions of the latter under the specific goals.  2 Theoretical and methodological considerations The analysis we present below draws theoretically from critical approaches to studying the maintenance, functioning and effects of political and ideological hegemony. Associated inter alia with the works of Italian philosopher Antonio Gramsci (1971) , and operationalized in seminal studies such as Edward Said’s Orientalism (1978) , as well as in critical International Political Economy (Robinson, 2005; Morton, 2007 ), this strand of Critical Theory  (Cox, 1981 ) is concerned with investigating common-sense assumptions about rule, hierarchy, competency and legitimacy (‘hegemony’). Like discourse analytically oriented theories (for instance, Adams, 2016 ) and constructivist approaches (indicatively, Bernstein, 2002 ), the approach is focused on the power of ideas, and on how ideational factors shape frameworks for how politics and policy are conceived, legitimized and enacted. However, there is a difference. Both discourse theorists and constructivists generally focus on elaborating that  certain ideational factors have contributed to the consolidation of a particular framework. In addition, they concern themselves with what ideational features this framework exhibits. Bernstein’s book (2002)  on how the ‘compromise of liberal environmentalism’ emerged as the preferred and dominant framing for global initiatives directed at squaring the circle of environmental and developmental objectives in world politics, illustrates such a focus very well. The critical  study of hegemony, however, adds to such reconstructive analytics the objective of disclosing how alternatives (including alternative ideational frameworks) become sidelined or supressed in the process (Bieler & Morton, 2004 ), considering this to be centrally important to understanding the politics  of framework-consolidation. Where constructivists (and discourse theorists) foreground describing and disclosing order, critical theorists thus foreground conflict and political contestation, including regarding inequalities and injustices (Collins, 1994: 43–118 ). The two different analytical orientations are nevertheless complementary: The reconstructive approach to understanding framework-formation which is central to constructivist concerns, is indispensably a component of critical theoretic analytics. The critical orientation, including towards alternatives sidelined or suppressed, shares cross-purposes with what Stirling (2010)  has usefully identified as ‘plural and conditional science advise’ (1030). In his defence of a more robust and democratically accountable conception of science advise in public policy and political decision making (2010: 1029; see also Bhardwaj et al., 2019: 143 ), Stirling stresses the limitations of practices inclined to ‘asserting an apparent consensus, even where one does not exist’ (2010: 1030). Our study of the SDG initiative interrogates it as representing such a consensus, and thus responds to his (and others’) call for a research agenda that makes political premises explicit . We demonstrate that the SDG framework draws its legitimacy from a public appeal to ‘sustainable development’ that disarticulates  deeper political commitments which we extract by way of a hermeneutic analysis focused on disclosing the architectural function of Goal 17. From the perspective of the critical theoretic approach we have sketched here, this allows us to restore two key dimensions to debates about the SDGs: Firstly, our analysis complements those by other critical observers who have concentrated on problems of fragmentation, lack of integration, or potential friction between sectorally defined goals, targets and indicators (indicatively, from different perspectives, Boas et al., 2016; Bhardwaj et al., 2019 ). We show that the key to understanding how the SDGs nevertheless cohere as a framework is to focus on the overlooked ‘means of implementation’ that are mainstreamed into each of the Goals, and integrated by way of the “Implementation Goal” 17, which is structurally and logically different from all others. Secondly, we explicate the ideological core assumptions underpinning and sustaining this integration, and demonstrate its political implications, thus highlighting how alternatives are excluded and ‘democratic accountability’ (Stirling, 2010: 1029 ) withheld. We have operationalized this broad theoretical orientation methodologically in the following ways: Immanent Critique:  The entire SDG framework document has been subjected to a close-read discourse analysis with particular focus on structural similarities and differences between goals, and the construction of linkages between Goals, Targets, Indicators, and the supplemented Means of Implementation. We disclose aspects of this systematic reconstruction by way of examples throughout the paper. Close-reading led to identifying the ‘special status’ of Goal 17, as well as its congregating function for the MoI-rendition under the individual 16 other Goals. Thematic Political Analysis : We selected for special attention those Goals in the agenda that comprise specifically environmental dimensions. Thematically, the SDGs represent a global framework for ‘development’ that is explicitly indexed to achieving environmental objectives (reflected in the revalorization of sustainability). Concentrating in particular on Goals with clear targets and indicators that express envisaged environmental outcomes provided us with the best possible sample for answering the question of how the integration of environmental and developmental objectives is framed in the SDGs, and on what premises and assumptions this framing rests. Together with the background review of the relevant literature, this provided us with the evidence for identifying Modernization Theory (MT) and its green variant, Ecological Modernization Theory (EMT) as the ideological core. Critical Discourse Analysis-Counterfactual Case Sampling.  In order to tease out what the consequences of adopting, promoting, and implementing the MoI logic of the SDG framework might mean, we constructed case-examples for environmental policy implications. For these, we relied on extensive background-reading and literature reviews. Studies and meta-studies reporting on specific environmental challenges (for example, on agricultural biodiversity) have thus been used in our analysis as backdrops to explicating how the SDG agenda shapes responses to these. This approach provides texture to our reconstruction of how the ideological premises underpinning the SDGs foreclose or disarticulate potential alternative policy choices, frameworks or approaches. It should be noted that the ‘counter-factual’ designation is used here in the ‘weak’ sense: the studies we draw on to highlight ecological or environmental challenges that may be framed in politically restrictive fashion under the SDG approach are ‘counter-factual’ in that they were not written or conceived for the purposes of engaging the SDGs. Indicating implications and tensions as we do is therefore speculative (in the sense of not strictly reflecting ‘impact studies’), but plausible, and, for the purposes of identifying the ‘excluded alternatives’ justifiable. In what follows, we disclose this approach in an integrated narrative. We guide our readers to the key analytical points by way of reconstructing the critical literature on the SDGs, introducing our approach and highlighting the contributions our study makes.  3 The four explicit environmental goals and their relation to development objectives Sustainability frames the entire approach of the SDGs, and in that regard environmental objectives are at least implicated  pervasively. Nevertheless, there are also four explicit  Goals specifically about environmental concerns:• Goal 12, “Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns”.  • Goal 13, “Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts”.  • Goal 14, “Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development”.  • Goal 15, “Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss”.    As with all of the goals, these are broken down into numerous targets and correlated indicators, not least with an eye to specific biomes. To its advocates, the SDG agenda is conceptualized in terms general enough to satisfy an aspiration towards non-pernicious universalism (Long, 2015 ). It is anticipated that different biomes require differential approaches to the maintenance or improvement of their integrity. Thus, the language of goals, targets and indicators reflects a ‘weak’ universalism, understood by advocates to guide  action in determined fashion, without over-determining  approaches. For example, under Goal 15, we find target 15.4 “by 2030, ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development”. The correlated indicator is 15.4.1, “Coverage by protected areas of important sites for mountain biodiversity” (UN, 2019: 16 ). A target construed and indexed like this has obvious problems; not among the least is, for example, what may happen to a mountain ecosystem thus protected, when its cryosphere rapidly disappears (hence the link with Goal 13). Likewise, this same problem will not likely be addressed through the only ‘means of implementation’ target that could  potentially apply under Goal 15, namely 15.a “mobilize and significantly increase financial resources from all sources to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity and eco-systems”.5  5 The indicators associated with the targets, unlike the targets themselves, are not  listed under the UN Resolution A/Res/70/1, the resolution establishing the SDGs. The ‘global indicator framework’ was adopted by the General Assembly in July 2017 (A/Res/71/313), and has been refined thrice by the UN’s Statistical Commission, in March 2018, in March 2019, and in March 2020 respectively.   The mobilization of financial resources would not seem to be an adequate response to potentially dramatic fresh-water loss to an alpine ecosystem as a result of the disappearance of glaciers (this disjuncture can be read off work on such ecosystems; indicatively see Loeffler et al., 2011 ). Another example of the problematic implications can be constructed with reference to Goal 12 (Ensure Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns). There is an obvious contradiction, for instance, between a target such as 12.3, “half per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels, and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses”, its indicators 12.3.1 “(a) Food loss index, and (b) food waste index” and Goal 2 “End Hunger”. The implications of this quickly become quite obviously problematic: Under Goal 2, we find a rearticulation of the position associated with classical Malthusian optimism (Sen, 1982: 450-51 ), which strongly correlates hunger with ‘lack of food availability ’, and the latter with the need for rapid increases in food volume production (Florini & Pauli, 2018 ). Target 2.3 reads: “By 2030, double agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers (…)”. Exactly why  both, food waste reduction (12.3) and  the doubling of production are required under the SDG regime to end hunger, can only be made intelligible, if the Malthusian premise is accepted that there is not enough  food being produced, and that hunger is a result of failing to produce adequate volumes.6  6 This observation is aside from the fact that there is ample critical research to dispel these premises and their implications comprehensively. Consider indicatively, Ostrom’s accounts of ‘managing commons’ (1990) ; Pimentel et al. (2005) ; McMichael (2013) .   One upshot of this is a turn towards agri-business, and the pursuit of programmes for ‘sustainable intensification’, which have been shown to be both, ecologically and socio-politically very problematic (Spann, 2017: 366-7 ). Equally unclear in the context of this example is the complex correlation between mandating productivity increases (2.3), and, for example, biodiversity loss (15.9: “By 2020, integrate eco-system and biodiversity values into national and local planning, development processes, poverty reduction strategies and accounts”). Commodity-production oriented farming practices have severely impacted agricultural  biodiversity, not least as a result of battles for market-shares among food-trade aggregators (Wolff, 2004 ).7  7 Of course, one  way to think about such issues is in terms of ‘trade-offs’. Sachs et al. (2019)  raise this, and commendably suggest that such trade-offs are the result of poor policy-design (806); however, they do not inquire into what drives the emergence of situations that present themselves as ‘trade-offs’. In any case, the more important points here would be those raised by Stirling (2010)  that a) the political implications of decision-making should be made explicit, and b) that complexity ought to be acknowledged, addressed and processed transparently. This also congeals with the findings in the Multi-Criteria Decision Approaches (indicatively, see Bhardwaj et al., 2018).   In such a context, MoI-target 2.c, “adopt measures to ensure the proper functioning of food-commodity markets and their derivatives, and facilitate timely access to market information, including on food-reserves, in order to help limit extreme food-price volatility”, reinforces highly problematic trends led by food-commodity market dynamics (UNCTAD, 2009 ). In practice, this simply provides continuity for interested parties such as food-commodity traders and investors in agribusiness concerns. It does not tackle the re- and mal-distribution challenges over hunger, or the increasing commercial pressures experienced by small farm producers (for a critical discussion, see indicatively De Schutter, 2010a, 2010b ). Such problems are in addition to the fact that the ‘food availability’ thesis as the key explanation of experiences of hunger which underpins the Goal 2 approach, has been comprehensively debunked (Sen, 1982; McMichael, 2013; Patel, 2007, Saurin, 1997 ). There is ample scope for constructing further examples along similar lines, specifically with regard to the issues raised for ‘other’ Goals by the four explicitly environmental ones. In order to come to an understanding of what makes the entire edifice cohere despite  such seemingly obvious tensions and contradictions, it is instructive to pursue the question of the premises on which the SDGs rest. We can do so in two steps: Firstly, by expanding the ‘cross-reading’ approach already practiced with the two examples above by considering overlaps with further  Goals; and secondly, by tracing the grammar of the MoIs, which are present in all Goals and expressed as their own targets, in conjunction with a critical reconstruction of premises of Goal 17.8  8 See UN Resolution 70/1, “Transforming our world”, which is explicit on identifying MoI. See Point 17 (6): “It crucially defines means of implementation.” Point 61 (28) elaborates further: “The Agenda’s Goals and targets deal with the means required to realize our collective ambitions. The means of implementation targets under each Sustainable Development Goal and Goal 17, which are referred to above, are key to realizing our Agenda and are of equal importance with the other Goals and targets. We shall accord them equal priority in our implementation efforts in the global indicator process for monitoring our progress.” The final point of the Agenda (prior to moving on to the structuring of follow-on and review processes) reiterates and reinforces the centrality of MoI: “We reiterate that this Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals and targets, including the means of implementation, are universal, indivisible and interlinked.” (Point 71, 31).    4 Overlapping environmental and development goals: Ecological Modernization Theory as the framing discourse The SDGs did not just follow on from the MDGs. Both initiatives are significantly shaped by, and remain enmeshed within parameters of a global governance consensus reaching back to the 1987 Brundtland Report Our Common Future  (UN, 1987 ).  The report, the UN declarations it inspired9  9 Including the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development (see indicatively Thomas 1994).  , and the multilateral agreements and institutions it helped to influence, signified a major shift in how development and environmental objectives would be framed. Analysts in International Relations have pointed out that the governance agenda established in this context constituted a distinctive ‘liberal compromise’ (indicatively, Bernstein, 2002 ).10  10 See more critical contributions that nevertheless came to similar conclusions; see e.g. Paterson and Newell, 2010 ; Dauvergne, 2016 ; Princen, 2005 .   Substantially, this compromise consisted in the agreement reached at the international level that development, guaranteed by the facilitation of economic growth, should be regarded as a critical precondition for achieving environmental protection or restoration objectives (UN, 1987 : Preamble 3).11  11 This same premise was reproduced in the Rio Declaration. See, in particular, Principle 12: “States should cooperate to promote a supportive and open international economic system that would lead to economic growth and sustainable development in all countries, to better address the problems of environmental degradation.”   The report, and the consensus it announced to the world, thus followed effectively the prescriptive implications of Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) theory. EKC adopts Kuznets’ more general economic theorem. He hypothesized that negative trends such as rising inequality and poverty during the process of a country’s economic development are eventually overcome as a function of economic growth. Kuznets hypothesised this tendency for economic inequality, but it was subsequently adapted to the EKC theory, popularly expressed as “the solution to pollution is more economic growth”.12  12 EKC became a framing argument already in the context of the World Bank’s World Development Report (1992: 39) . See also Beckerman (1992) .  Our Common Future  made its axiomatic implications central to the construction of the meaning of sustainability: Economic growth as the precondition for expanding social inclusion is, throughout the report, framed as the necessary precursor to taking pressures off the environment, and for the prospect of successfully arresting or reverting environmental degradation.13  13 The EKC continues to capture the imagination of researchers and policy-makers alike. As our reconstruction suggests, this is not because of its capacity to deliver robust results, or a sufficiently generalized and valid development model. Typically now, researchers ‘test’ the EKC theorem in sector, or factor-specific case studies, and the conclusions are more often than not mixed (see, for just a small sample of recent such studies, Nemati et al., 2019; Kleemann & Abdulai, 2013; Sarkodie & Strezov, 2018 ). A bibliographic and meta-analysis provides a good snapshot of both, the ‘mixed results’ message, as well as the continuing appeal of the EKC; see Sarkodie and Strezov (2019) . This appeal, we argue, is because the theory suggestively formalizes  hegemonic ideas about under-development, development pathways, and environmental change that justify interventions and policies in terms of their conduciveness to the ‘greened’ variant of Modernization Theory, Ecological Modernization Theory. Our assessment here aligns with studies that have subjected the EKC to comprehensive critical review, such as Stern (2004) , who indeed focuses on the generalized  pollution reduction claims associated with the theory originally (unlike the many studies today that seek out the effect in sector-or factor-specific contexts). Stern’s suggestion of an imminent demise of EKC in 2004 did not come to pass despite his thoroughly convincing debunking of the theory, because of the latter’s ideological  appeal and function.   In putting forward this position, Our Common Future  and the governance frameworks it helped to create and sustain, adopted a particular political and ideological outlook, specifically vis a vis political challenges and challengers. On the development-side, the compromise articulated in Our Common Future  represented a dismissal of the calls for more comprehensive, redistributive policies that had characterised South-North relations in the context of calls for a New International Economic Order (NIEO; see Weber, 2016; Thomas, 1985: 122-55 ). On the environmental politics side, it comprehensively pushed aside ‘green’ experimentalism, and in particular innovative approaches to economic organization oriented towards ecological objectives; among the latter were, for instance, precisely ‘zero-growth’ concepts (Offe, 1987; Daly, 1977 ). Our Common Future  also provided a notable integration of environmental and developmental challenges. The nexus between the two is constructed primarily around poverty  (UN 1987, see specifically Preamble 3; and point 8 under the Rubric ‘The Global Challenge’). ‘Development’ conceived of as ‘economic growth’ is in this constellation configured to be the solution to both. Poverty, in turn, is strongly correlated with environmental deterioration, and in some passages the two dynamics of impoverishment and ecological decline are conceptualized as a downward spiral, or a trap. It is important to put these claims into some context. Early work in the then nascent sub-discipline of Political Ecology had already demonstrated that many of the assumptions behind them were fallacious, or even simply wrong (Blaikie, 1985; Peluso & Watts, 2001; Forsyth, 2003 ). Likewise, there was a large body of work in (International) Political Economy and (Critical) Development Studies that was able to demonstrate that the origins of poverty lay not in people living under conditions of a lack of development, but were more often than not attributable to particular  projects of development, including the legacies of colonialism (Rodney, 1972; Mintz, 1986; Davis, 2000; Anghie, 1993 ). By nevertheless persisting with the assumption of a mutually reinforcing dynamic relationship between poverty and environmental decline, the report shores up its account of the overarching importance of achieving rapid (and inclusive) economic growth for development.14  14 The pitch to ‘inclusiveness’ needs to be read as a declaration of intent with heavy qualifications. There have been many decades of ‘official recognition’ that poverty and inequality are linked, and both have to be addressed and altered significantly. Despite such pronouncements, the many critical studies on reasons and causes for the persistence of poverty and inequality, and their relationship to the dominant development model, have not been heeded, let alone integrated into policy approaches. For a critique of the MDGs from such a vantage point, see Amin (2006) . For a general critical account of development, see McMichael (2017) .   This framing of ‘development’ and ‘poverty’ through the prism of economic growth and technological advancement aligns Our Common Future  with what has been the dominant theory of international development, namely Modernization Theory .15  15 The classic statement, including the logic of stages, state-centrism, methodological territorialism, and prescriptive capitalist development, remains Rostow (1960) . For a critical account, including of the continued relevance of Modernization Theory as a frame for contemporary development in the context of the SDGs, see Weber (2014) .   The construal of economic growth as central to achieving ecological objectives, turns the report into an early and comprehensive expression of Ecological Modernization Theory  (Mol et al., 2013 ; for a wide-ranging, critical reconstruction, see Bergius & Buseth, 2019 ). 16  16 Their critique also underscores that while EMT may  be the dominant approach adopted and replicated by key political agents and international institutions, it is neither uncontroversial, nor by any standards a ‘proven’ formula for achieving the squaring of the circle of environmental and developmental objectives.   Common to both is their ideological commitment to liberal capitalist principles generally, and a tendency to embrace within those neo-classical and neoliberal variants in particular (for a critical discussion, see Christoff, 1996: 485  ff). Ecological Modernization Theory (EMT) provides the central organizing grammar for the integration of ecological and development concerns in the SDGs. The use of the concept of ‘sustainability’ in the SDG-agenda converges, on closer scrutiny, with the axiomatic ideas and substantive assumptions underpinning EMT. Specifically, this becomes clear as ‘sustainability’ is supplemented with targets and  MoIs, which articulate very clearly with MT/EMT. We discuss this in further detail below. The SDG initiative also shares with EMT the problematic approach to hierarchising. Most important, at every step on the path to addressing ‘sustainability’ is the maintenance of economic growth through processes that are seen to enhance opportunities for such growth. We can explicate this clearly by cross-reading the more environmentally focused Goals of the SDG with Goal 8, “Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all”. Goal 8 targets express commitments to a) “sustain per capita economic growth in accordance with national circumstances and, in particular, at least 7 percent Gross Domestic Product growth per annum in the least developed countries” (8.1); b) “achieve higher levels of economic productivity” (8.2). Indicators for both are conventional aggregated economic growth measurements (UN, 2019: 8 ). Notably, target 8.4 contains a pitch towards “decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation, in accordance with the 10 Year Framework Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns”(10YFP). The 10YFP approach is premised on the idea  of a de-coupling of economic growth from environmental degradation; however, this ‘target’ of de-coupling (8.4) is not expressed in the indicators supplemented for it (8.4.1 & 8.4.2). The latter merely measure absolute figures of ‘material footprint’ and ‘domestic material consumption’. In any case, this is the only  mention of a potential clash between environmental and economic growth objectives; perhaps the use of the concept of decoupling may suggest intriguing possibilities. However, these are not reflected in the two MoI targets for Goal 8 (a and b). On the contrary, 8.a proposes to increase ‘aid for trade’ support for developing countries (UN, 2019: 9 ). This is a clear articulation of the primacy afforded in the framework to realizing and shoring up the multilateral free trade agenda as reflected prominently in the WTO (but also in regional agreements such as the USMCA/formerly NAFTA). It corroborates with the emphasis on the maintenance and enhancement of the WTO-led multilateral trading system under Goal 17. With regard to the stated objective of de-coupling economic growth from environmental degradation under target 8.4, the supplementation with target 8.a (MoI) is thus problematic.17  17 For the purpose of our argument here, we take the implied positives of the de-coupling agenda at face value. There is good reason to follow analyses of the role and function of the de-coupling imaginary under the SDGs that stress its ideological thrust and political purpose. For an excellent account in this vein that traces the origins of this conception of de-coupling, reports the critiques of it by, inter alia, steady-state critical political economists, and unpacks the ideological cogency with neoliberal precepts, see Fletcher and Rammelt (2017) .   There has been plenty of evidence on negative environmental effects from trade liberalization regimes, and trade-related investment agreements, suggesting that rather than facilitating ‘de-coupling’, trade agreements can have a tendency towards reinforcing  negative envrionmental externalities (Public Citizen, 2003; Weber, 2005; Marden, 1999; Gonzalez, 2011 ).18  18 This is aside from negative socio-political implications, which cannot be ‘de-coupled’ from environmental concerns either. We have included some examples, specifically with regard to agriculture, that highlight this, but it is also plausible to link here to macro-studies about increasing socio-economic inequality such as Piketty (2013) .   While such effects are perhaps not always  inevitable, or could be avoided or mitigated by well-designed framing policies, side-agreements, or supplementary regulation, in practice the correlation between trade-facilitated economic expansion (local and global), and negative environmental trends has been too strong not to cause concern (Conca, 2006; Clapp & Fuchs, 2009 ). A key normative pillar of the WTO’s relationship with environmental international agreements, for example, is that the latter are to be designed on the principle of ‘least trade restrictive’ policy-making (Brunner, 1997 ). Behind this axiom lies the idea that liberalized trade and investment facilitate in approximate fashion the conditions for ‘perfect competition’, and the latter in turn guarantees the most efficient use of resources. From an ecological  perspective, however, ‘efficiency’ so conceived lacks crucial contextual components. To bring different eco-systems into competition with one another with regard to producing a particular commodity (for instance, corn), may lead to the degradation of both (one, as it turns into a monoculture with a wipe-out of prior biodiversity; the other as it degrades while ‘trying and failing’ to compete with the output from the former; see Altvater & Mahnkopf, 1997: 451-52 ). From a critical perspective, the SDGs articulate a comprehensive integration of different goals that comprise highly contradictory and conflictual implications. In order for such substantive problems to not  register in the discourses aimed at advancing the SDG agenda, the master-concept of ‘sustainability’ is deployed to comprise a grammar of cohesiveness and integration. However, it is also effectively deployed to disarticulate how and on what premises cohesiveness is achieved, something that only becomes clearer once the MoI-components and their linkage with the ‘special’ Goal 17 are subjected to critical scrutiny. To the broader public, the SDGs are presented in a normative language of a desirable, pronounced ‘transformative shift’ and inclusivity (UN, 2013 ).19  19 See the executive summary for this point.   The continuities with received preconceptions about ‘development’ and ‘environment’, and the central role assigned to a further entrenchment of capitalist social relations, are neither explicitly disclosed, nor made part of the mobilization drives for the agenda. From our discussion above, and from the examples in the previous section, it ought to be clearer, that the normative grammar underpinning the SDG agenda has been strongly aligned with the premises and mainstays of EMT, the environmentally reoriented restatement of the dominant development theory of the past 60 years Modernization Theory (MT). Without noting this close alignment, studies of the SDGs have focused on the MoIs only as a way to flush out weaknesses or problems with targets, indicators, or the designs these express and authorize. We have concentrated on the commonalities among the MoIs and suggested their cogency with the ideological premises of EMT. To demonstrate this conclusively, we now turn to Goal 17, the Means of Implementation Goal. Of all the 17 goals, it the only one that is both, a goal, and an expression of an overall processual conception of how the other goals are to be realized. In this sense, as the MoI goal, it sits above  the specific MoI targets under the other 16.  5 Goal 17, the core MoI of the SDGs SDG 17 “Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development” comprises five sections considered by the drafters of the agenda to be crucial to enabling the entire approach to global governance. “Finance”, “Technology”, “Capacity Building”, “Trade”, and the somewhat more vague concept of “Systemic Issues” are listed for these, and matched with targets and indicators. Goal 17 is the only  Goal that does not have MoI’s differentiated by alpha-numericals. This is not surprising, in that it is also singled out in the UN Declaration on the SDGs (United Nations, 2015 : §40, 10) as the “Means of Implementation” Goal. Notably, the only explicit reference to environmental  (or ecological) concerns under Goal 17 occurs in the Section on “Technology”, where it is associated with Target 17.7 (“Promote the development, transfer, dissemination, and diffusion of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries on favourable terms, including on concessional and preferential terms, as mutually agreed”). This target echoes well-established policy-language on technology transfers, which have formed parts of many international and multilateral environmental agreements (Prip et al., 2015; Popp, 2011 ). Though the commitments articulated herein are certainly to be welcomed, it is less than clear whether the SDG agenda adds significant momentum to past efforts, and whether mandated action under SDG 17.7 is conceived in a way so as to have to take note of lessons from past problems or failures. The indicator for this target (17.7.1) is the ‘total amount of approved funding for developing countries to promote the development, transfer, dissemination and diffusion of environmentally sound technologies’.20  20 We can certainly think of useful technology in this context, including solar energy (where feasible) which could help with health facilities, education, sanitation, water, for instance. The question of scale comes into view here, not least with reference to how better ‘ecological fit’ may be created by more (and more) de-centralized approaches (see Schuhmacher, 1973 ; see also the ‘Social Ecology’ promoted by Bookchin, 1982 ).   It is less than clear what prescriptive force the wording on ‘environmentally sound’ technologies confers. On one end of the spectrum, this could refer to bilateral or multilateral enabling cooperation for decentralized solar power facilities aimed at supplying, for example, public facilities such as hospitals, schools, administrative complexes, or infrastructure. On the other end of the spectrum, it could involve the transfer of high-end technologies with ‘greener edges’ for fossil fuel extraction projects. “Environmentally sound” could be applied in each case, but with quite different overall ecological implications. It is clear that 17.7 can, in principle, be interpreted in line with the first of these two examples. However, when 17.7 is contextualized with the remainder of the targets (and indicators) assembled under the “Means of Implementation Goal”, its meaning becomes skewed much more decisively towards the second example marking the continuum above. Thus, for instance, under the section on “Finance”, target 17.2 clearly stresses the need to reinforce Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) financing; however, 17.3 and 17.5 focus on investment promotion schemes for developing and least developed countries. Together, these three targets articulate with the objectives stated under target 17.9, the only one in the ‘Capacity Building’ section. Likewise, they are co-conditioned by the targets under the sections on ‘Trade’ and ‘Systemic Issues’. For example, 17.9 (Capacity Building) refers to the support for national plans in order to implement all  SDGs in developing countries. This corroborates with the section on Trade, and specifically with targets 17.10, 17.11, and 17.12, to promote WTO membership and progressive trade and investment liberalization. 17.11 refers to “significantly increase the exports of developing countries, in particular with a view to doubling the least developed countries’ share of exports by 2020” (UN, 2019: 20 ).21  21 To corroborate this with a critical example, consider the short discussion of Goal 2 in the opening parts of the paper.   We can corroborate this again with Goal 2 (“End Hunger”), and the associated MoI indicator, 2.a. The productivist bias, advanced in the logic of progressive commercialization, is put centre-stage here (indicative for this approach, see e.g. Baulcombe et al., 2009 ). We can extend this to include the targets under Goal 9 (“build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation”). Target 9.2 aims to “promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030, significantly raise industry’s share of employment and gross domestic product, in line with national circumstances, and double its share in least developed countries”. This is in keeping with ‘global value chain’ approaches to economic growth as a means to achieve development, and ignores the fact that such conceptions rest on practices of exploitation that have been investigated, for instance, through the critical lens of ‘poverty chains and global capitalism’ (Selwyn, 2019 ). The ecological implications of the SDG agenda’s specific configuration of modernization and progress are much more problematic than the overall deployment of the language of ‘sustainability’ permits one to apprehend. Two illustrations may suffice to make this point: The first can be taken from the context of USMCA/NAFTA, the regional free-trade agreement implemented between two ‘developed’ and one formerly ‘developing’ country partners (under conventional categorisations). In the context of what is best described as investors and corporations capitalizing on races-to-the-bottom, as both production and investment were facilitated by the NAFTA, a large number of environmental problems were introduced alongside (Public Citizen, 2003 ). For example, extant pesticide used to treat mango or tomato-plantations, led to both, significant environmental and labour-health problems (Barndt, 1997; Alvarez, 2001 ). The USMCA/NAFTA prioritizes investor interests and associated rights, and despite the inclusion of an ostensible ‘environmental side-agreement’ lacks serious policy commitments to ‘making trade work for environmental objectives’.22  22 For a critical reconstruction of the weaknesses of the Environmental Side-Agreement approach, see Thomas and Weber (1999) . For an articulation of the notion that trade-agreements will deliver environmental objectives only  if they are “carefully designed to do so’, see Nordstroem and Vaughan (1999) .   Notorious cases that were moved to arbitration under the agreement often went against environmental concerns, leading prominent critics to conclude that ‘NAFTA Chapter 11 provisions have been used to attack environmental and health policies’.23  23 Public Citizen (2003) . The report narrates the outlines of ‘Metalclad v. Mexican Government’, which awarded the company USD 15.6 million in compensation as a result of the Mexican municipal government of Guadalcazar’s refusal to grant a permit for a toxic waste processing plant (p.4). Emblematic older cases like this are in continuity  with more recent assessments. For instance, Labonte et al. (2019)  spell through the negative implications for public health provisions under the new UMSCA agreement that has ‘replaced’ the NAFTA.   The NAFTA provided the blueprint for the institutionalisation of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade-talks in the World Trade Organization, to the point of the latter shadowing versions of the NAFTA side-agreements on Labour and the Environment (Weber, 2001 ). The problematic implications of the USMCA/NAFTA are equally, if not more prominent under the WTO-led trade and investment liberalization approach, specifically in the context of the “Doha Development Agenda” (2000-ongoing).24  24 For a critical analysis of the Doha Development Agenda, see Higgott and Weber (2005) .   To demonstrate this, we draw on two agreements, the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), and the agreement on Trade Related Intellectual Property (TRIPS). Under the GATS, public services such as health, water, sanitation, or transport, are scheduled as sectors, to be treated as any other tradeable commodity. States are, under the agreement, committed to the progressive realization of conditions for offering such services on a commercial basis (Kelsey, 2010; Krajewski, 2003 ).25  25 These two references remain crucial resources in that they provided the most comprehensive interpretations of the GATS from a critical legal studies perspective. The latter has remained central to understanding political contestations around the agreement. Other contributors in that vein include Howse (2005)  and Lang (2013) .   In practice, such policy approaches have led to numerous high-profile failures, including severe social unrest and conflict. Water privatization in European municipalities led to provision-shortfalls, decline in water quality, and public outrage; and large-scale privatization of water infrastructure caused public upheaval in Bolivia and throughout other parts of the world (Morgan, 2011 ). In South Africa, for example, “water supply cut-offs have provoked violent uprisings among the urban poor. Between late-2000 and early 2002, South Africa suffered a severe outbreak of Cholera that was traced to the use of polluted water by poor people in the face of rising water-rates and service cut-offs” (Conca, 2006: 238 ). The ecological credentials of the GATS are similarly problematic. A closer look at the motifs and motivations behind the drive for including environmental services in the GATS, reveals that the main objective was to open markets particularly in developing countries to investors.26  26 See the general reconstruction of environmental services trade in Weber (2005) ; for a more general critique of the GATS, see Krajewski (2003) .   Whatever ecological impact such investments might bring along, is relegated to regulatory responses in the targeted countries (for a critical discussion of implications for regulation, see Howse, 2012 ); that such investment-driven services trade failed to deliver substantive improvements, or made things worse even under conditions of (presumed!) high-standard regulatory regimes (for example in France, or Wales, in the case of water), does little to allay concerns (Morgan, 2011: esp 49–84; Bakker, 2003 ).27  27 It is important to note that the drive towards the privatization of public services predated the implementation of the GATS. Such trends had been under way particularly in developing countries in the context not only of bilateral aid agreements, but also through the mandated reforms under Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) by multilateral development agencies such as the World Bank and the IMF.   Similar issues have frequently turned up in the context of the TRIPs regime. Intellectual property rights, effectively rights to exclude others from the use or replication of ideas embodied in products or designs, thus permitting ‘access’ to these to be contingent on fee-payment, have been used frequently to undermine whatever has remained of commons-type use regimes. A very good example for exploring the ecological implications of this can be found in the context of a global trend in declining agricultural biodiversity. The seed-exchange regimes that facilitated the development over many generations of Mexico’s biodiversity in maize did not rely on IPRs, but instead on purposive, cooperative social exchange mechanisms, using, and networking with, local information.28  28 A good account of the backdrop to Mexican biodiversity in maize, as well as of the negative impact of trade-liberalization for ecological biodiversity in that sector, can be found in Nadal (2000) .   On the other end of the spectrum, we have the intellectual property enabled system of commodity production in agricultural goods. Here, crop-varieties can be bought for exclusive, licensed use, with farmers compensating owners of IPR; these owners, however, also  compete for market-share, leading to incentives to ‘retire’ crop varieties in order to concentrate output and cut overhead costs. A significant component of the loss of agricultural biodiversity can thus be seen to be attributable to incentives associated with the currently dominant IPR regime, and, by extension, to the agenda to deepen the latter’s reach and comprehensiveness under an agreement like TRIPs.29  29 See Wolff (2004) . Other examples include practices of expropriation of long-established ‘commons’, such as the famous Neem-Tree patent case, a stand-in for many other cases of ‘bio-prospecting’; see Marden (1999) . A more recent discussion of the impacts of TRIPS in Indian agricultural relations that aims at a nuanced and well-balanced analysis, nevertheless bears out that without significant push-back from movement-actors and civil society organizations, the regimes implications for farmers and farming communities would be highly problematic (Venkatesan, 2018 ).   In the light of the exemplary reconstructions above, it becomes evident how the meaning of ‘sustainability’, and sustainable development, as operationalized in SDG 17, is conceptually aligned with Modernization Theory, and its ‘greened’ off-shoot, Ecological Modernization Theory. SDG 17 provides an excellent window on what this means. The ‘Means of Implementation’ that it comprises are effectively restatements of orthodoxies derived from Modernization Theory that have been rehearsed for so long that they can be made to appear as common-sensical (and, in that sense, hegemonic). Modernization Theory’s framing of development in terms of the goal of achieving high mass consumption serves as justification for prioritising the facilitation of economic growth as a key objective. This justification extends to the doctrine that such growth depends on private investment. The global development architecture that emerged out of this elevation of commercial relations to the status of the prime objective, co-produced over the 60-odd years of its dominance in international affairs two macro-political challenges with unprecedented implications. On the one hand, we have extreme (and rising) social inequality (with its correlates of poverty and exclusion); and on the other, a global crisis of eco-systemic integrity. Both together are a clear challenge that constitutes a significant legitimacy-problem for MT. Ecological Modernization Theory emerged in the context of such pressures as a way to endogenize the environmental problematique, and suggest that MT could be ‘greened’, ostensibly proving also its capacity to reform. The conceptual vocabulary used to achieve this received its master-concept in ‘sustainability’, a term that could be equally applied to social affairs and  ecological concerns. Sustainable development thus became the conceptual frame that serves to render the ideological nature and substantively contradictory and pernicious implications of MT invisible, at least for the majority of practitioners and analysts. Goals 1–16 may, at a certain level of reading, be uncontroversial: Who, for instance, would disagree with an agenda to ‘end hunger’?30  30 See the parallel critical argument made for the MDGs by Amin (2006) .   The controversies enter as soon as the focus turns critically to the ‘MoI’ targets under each Goal, and their relation to the logically distinct Goal 17 (logically distinct from the other sixteen). In general, even critical studies of the SDGs missed the fact that it is Goal 17, and the extension of the MoI through  the architecture of the SDGs that provide the diverging and sometimes contradictory objectives comprised in them with a sense of cohesiveness, and with a determinate, political ideological thrust. Analyses of the SDGs, specifically when framed predominantly by interests in individual goals and the potential to reform their implementation, miss the overall ideological inflection of the entire project that can be made salient in the context of a close reading of Goal 17, and its implications.31  31 For an exception during the period of the run-up to the SDGs, see Weber (2014) , as well as the follow-up (2017) .   That Goal 17 has not received the same level of attention as the other Goals32  32 It is interesting, for example, that an explicitly conceptual  study of the SDGs, aimed at elaborating logical differences between the Goals listed, such as Camacho (2015) , does not pick up on the special status of Goal 17, and the logic of MoI. This echoes with the omission we alerted to with reference to Sachs et al. (2019) .  , or has in some cases even been deliberately  excluded from analytical concerns (Le Blanc, 2015 ), may hence be attributable to the hold that both, MT, and by extension EMT continue to have on ‘sustainable development thinking’.  6 Concluding observations Our critical examination of the SDGs has disclosed two politically significant aspects of it that have to date not been recognized. Firstly, we have reconstructed the SDG-Agenda’s framing of the environment-and-development constellation with particular attention to the MoI targets, and their framing through Goal 17. This highlighted the architectural functions of Goal 17 and its reach through the MoI aspects of the entire agenda. Research on the SDGs from both, the science and social sciences has not recognized the MoI for what they are and do. Secondly, we have, by way of this critical reconstruction, demonstrated that on closer scrutiny the concept of sustainable development as utilized under the SDG-agenda aligns closely with the premises and mainstays of Ecological Modernization Theory (EMT). This supplements ‘sustainability’ with quite specific meaning and implications. The cohesiveness and integrated nature of the SDG approach is thus achieved on the basis of ideological premises informed by Modernization Theory, and its ‘greened variant’ (EMT). This agenda is inflected with a radical twist. As the tacit priority assumed by Goal 17-related objectives demonstrates, there is a strong bias in favour of further commodification of public services and the commons, of the pursuit of economic growth, of the empowerment of private interests, and against  commons-type understandings, institutions or practices of linking environmental and development objectives. The problems associated with the SDG agenda are thus to a significant extent obscured through the political traction that the discourse of sustainable development has commanded generally. The widespread use of the concept of sustainable development in public discourse is not immediately associated with privileging a narrow development agenda focused on prioritizing economic growth as a precondition of addressing ecological and social objectives. As we have shown, the concept of sustainability under the SDGs is deeply aligned with EMT as an approach to development. Crucially, sustainability in this case rests on privileging economic growth, continuing with a framing that was presented as a ‘consensus’ already in the Brundtland Report and consolidated at the Rio Conference of 1992. This specific supplementation of the meaning and normative force of ‘sustainability’ with the ideological premises of EMT is, however, not immediately accessible if one focusses on the Goals, their stated purposes, or even targets associated with them. Rather, the key to disclosing the political ideological architecture that provides operational cohesion to the SDGs is in the MoI component. We discussed some of the social and ecological implications of this above. As with MT, EMT structures a particular temporalizing development regime. Its upshot is that addressing substantive issues, in our case the environment-and-development constellation, is contingent on the prior realization of economic growth objectives. Addressing development induced deprivation and inequality, as well as repairing or restoring extant ecological damage and destruction, are permanently deferred under this approach to a future when ‘sufficient growth’ has been achieved. The conceptual disarticulation of injustices (social and ecological) from relations of development, by both, MT and EMT is configured through a stages-logic. The consequences of the latter are two-fold: On the one hand it conceptually delinks unequal relations of development in favour of mapping societies and communities onto discrete stages. On the other hand, it sanctions a logic of catch-up that justifies further suffering and ecological degradation as necessary to realizing progress as economic growth. In line with critical studies that have stressed the importance of acknowledging and processing complexity and dissent (Stirling, 2010 ), or highlighted the potentials of multi-criteria decision making approaches (Bhardwaj et al., 2019 ), we have sought to make the politics of the SDGs explicit and more accessible. Rather than providing a framework for addressing the complex and challenging constellation that requires bringing environment-and-development objectives together in integrated, yet differentiated ways, the SDG agenda is conceived on the basis of reinforcing a highly contradictory and problematic ideological paradigm. There are, of course, alternative options to a global governance approach33  33 See, e.g. McMichael (2013) ; or Merino (2016) .   premised on EMT, a justificatory framework with a very problematic track-record. All too often, such alternatives are, however, caught up in pressures generated by the conventional development framework such as the one we have identified with reference to the SDG-agenda (indicatively, see Bebbington & Bebbington, 2011 ). The agenda itself belongs to a broader frame of the politics of global development defined by the iterative reconstitution of neoliberal ideals in line with the long-term premises of Modernization Theory and Ecological Modernization Theory. Studies that have stressed the complexities of working out approaches to integrating ecological, social and economic development concerns are cogent to our purpose of recognizing, explicating and ‘holding accountable’ dominant practices of political communication and decision-making (Stirling, 2010 ). The key objective of the close reading of the configuration of sustainability that underpins the SDG initiative, has been to make the political premises of its environment-and-development discourse explicit and accessible. Understanding the implications of the analysis we have presented ought to assist interlocutors, including from science and technology fields as well as the social sciences aiming to contribute to positive change. It is especially important in a context in which meaningfully addressing both, environmental and social objectives becomes more and more urgent. This demands a more thorough rethinking of ‘sustainable development’, and the political possibilities it promotes or precludes.
