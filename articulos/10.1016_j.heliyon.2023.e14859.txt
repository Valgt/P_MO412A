                  The changes in land use and land cover (LULC) contribute to carbon emissions that lead to climate change and global warming. Obtaining information on LULC change is of necessity to ensure land transformation planning, and anthropogenic and natural impact evaluation. The objective of this study is to analyze the historical changes in LULC in the Tano River Basin of Ghana, to provide scientific information for decision-making on achieving sustainable development. A supervised classification of Landsat images (1986, 2010, and 2020) using the Random Forest algorithm was performed, as well as a post-classification comparison of LULC maps in terms of area and size. A “from–to” matrix was used to identify the changes in LULC that occurred between the periods 1986–2010, 2010–2020, and 1986–2020. The results show an overall classification accuracy of 88.9, 88.5, and 88% for LULC maps for the years 1986, 2010, and 2020, respectively. Between the period 1986 and 2020, there is a conversion of the greater part of dense forest to open forest, and subsequently to settlement and cropland as a major historical LULC change pattern in the Tano basin. Cropland and Settlement increased at the rate of 24.8 km/yr and 1.5 km/yr respectively, while Dense forest and Open forest decreased at the rate of 298.4 km/yr and 173.9 km/yr over the period 1986 to 2020. The study outputs are not only useful for formulating and implementing national policies and programs but also, can contribute to assessing and monitoring progress towards attaining Sustainable Development Goal 13 (climate action).

Cropland and Settlement increased at the rate of 24.8 km/yr and 1.5 km/yr respectively, while Dense forest and Open forest decreased at the rate of 298.4 km/yr and 173.9 km/yr over the period 1986 to 2020. The study outputs are not only useful for formulating and implementing national policies and programs but also, can contribute to assessing and monitoring progress towards attaining Sustainable Development Goal 13 (climate action).   Keywords Land use change  Landsat images  Tano river basin  Sustainable development goals  Ghana    1 Introduction Land use and land cover (LULC) change, an old phenomenon, has gained attention due to unchecked human actions that have altered the earth's biophysical properties over time. According to Lambin et al. [1 ], LULC change is a disjunct process that, if not checked, can initiate other changes in the system. The causes of changes in LULC have been associated with anthropogenic factors such as deforestation, intensification of agriculture, and rapid urbanization that have greatly altered a large proportion of regions [2–4 ]. According to CIESIN [5 ], human activities have affected about 83% of the Earth's land surface. Therefore, obtaining information on LULC patterns is necessary to ensure land transformation planning, anthropogenic and natural impact evaluation [6 ]. LULC change, such as the conversion of vegetation to other land use types, may impact the global carbon cycle due to the addition or removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere [7 ]. Evidence shows that carbon removals and emissions due to changes in forest cover play a vital role in the carbon cycle at global and local scales [8 ,9 ], and their impact has been included in a recent assessment of carbon changes in the tropics during the 1990–2010 period [10 ]. The emission of greenhouse gases due to land use change would lead to global warming and climate change. According to Pongratz et al. [11 ], the changes in LULC can also affect the climate through biophysical effects on surface albedo, evapotranspiration, and surface roughness. In the Tano River Basin (TRB) of Ghana, forest cover plays a vital role in environmental conservation and local climate regulation. The evergreen forest of the TRB, in particular, plays a major role in sequestering carbon and offers tremendous potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, due to human activity over the past few decades, the TRB's primary rainforest and biodiversity have undergone significant and quick changes [12 ]. Logging and timber harvesting within the forest belt has already affected the natural ecosystem to a crucial point [12 ]. In the majority of the forest reserves, there is also extensive and noticeable cocoa farming along with gold mining. All of these human activities not only endanger the TRB's vegetation but also complicate the management of the area's natural resources. Apart from a study by Awotwi et al. [13 ] on tracking land use and land cover changes brought on by extensive gold mining, urban growth, and agriculture in Ghana's Pra River Basin, which is adjacent to the TRB, little is known about past and potential changes in LULC and their effects on sustainable development in the study region. The study aims to analyze the changes in LULC between the periods of 1986 and 2020 and provide scientific information for decision-making on achieving sustainable development.  2 Materials and method 2.1 Study area The TRB with an estimated area of about 15,083 km2  spans between latitudes 50 N - 70 40′ N and longitudes 20 00′ W- 30 15′ W in Ghana (Fig. 1  a). Rainfall at the basin is bi-modal with the major season from March to July, minor season from September to November, with August as a short dry spell month (Fig. 1 b). The mean annual rainfall for the basin is about 1390 mm, the temperature is about 25.9 °C and the Relative humidity ranges between 75% and 85% throughout the year [14 ]. At the spatial scale, the temperature increases from the south to the North, while rainfall decreases from the south to the north [12 ,14 ]. The elevation ranges between 0 m and 774 m (Fig. 1 c), with the basin mainly dominated by forest (76.9%) and agriculture (15.2%), with grassland and settlements covering the rest of the area [14 ,15 ]. Agriculture is the main activity in the basin with extensive cocoa farming taking place in the protected areas. Coconut plantation is also cultivated along the coastal strip of the basin. The basin's population is estimated to be about 2.4 million with a growth rate of about 2.2%/year [12 ].  2.2 Landsat images and reference data United States Geological Survey (USGS) archived Landsat images from 1986, 2010, and 2020 with a 30 m spatial range were used for the classification and change detection. The images that were downloaded are already completely corrected and come from Level 2 collections [16 ]. The characteristics of the Landsat images used in this research are displayed in Table 1  . Additionally, the downloaded images were chosen using a cloud cover threshold of less than 10%. To reduce confusion between cropland and vegetation, all of the images were obtained during the dry season (December–January) [17 ,18 ]. For training and accuracy evaluation purposes during Landsat image classification, ground-truth data from Google Earth (Spot 5, 2.5 m resolution) and field surveys were gathered. The Congalton [19 ] rule-of-thumb theory was applied to ensure that each LULC class received at least 50 points.  2.3 Mapping, accuracy assessment and change detection of land use-land cover The non-parametric Random Forest supervised image classification algorithm, a component of the R program, was used to classify the Landsat images [20 ]. The land use mapping technique is depicted in Fig. 2  . A collection of decision trees that are created autonomously by a machine learning algorithm called a random forest. A random collection of training samples (2/3) is used to create the tree of a random forest. The generalization mistakes linked to a single classification tree are overcome by increasing the number of trees during classification by increasing classification accuracy [20 ]. Based on the researcher's previous study and previous studies e.g. Refs. [18 ,21 ], of the study area, a classification system with five classes was implemented and modified: water bodies, cropland, open forest, settlement, and dense forest (Table 2  ). In this research, the algorithm was trained using high-resolution satellite images from Google Earth and ground truth data from a field campaign in 2019. Two-thirds of the training data are used for classification by the algorithm, and one-third of the leftover training samples are used for internal validation or accuracy evaluation. Using a confusion matrix method, the accuracy of the LULC maps for the years 1986, 2010, and 2020 was evaluated in order to validate the classified images. The kappa coefficient, errors of commission, errors of omission, and accuracy of the producer and consumer could all be evaluated using the confusion matrix formula [19 ]. Using a post-classification comparison of the LULC maps method in terms of area of size, the changes in LULC over the 34 years were assessed. A “from-to” matrix method was used to identify the changes in LULC that happened between the time periods 1986–2010, 2010–2020, and 1986–2020. Additionally, the percentage of LULC change and the rate of change over the past 34 years were calculated.   3 Results 3.1 LULC accuracy statistics Table 3  (a-b)   shows the results for accuracy assessment of the LULC maps with overall classification accuracy of 88.9%, 88.5% and 88% for the years 1986, 2010 and 2020 respectively. The heterogeneity of the region and the misclassification of cropland as grassland as a result of the use of mono-temporal data may be responsible for the acquired classification accuracy. According to Pontius [22 ], the recommended minimum level of accuracy is around 80%, hence in general, the classified LULC maps are acceptable for change analysis.  3.2 Patterns and changes in land use land cover over the period 1986 to 2020 Presented in Fig. 3   are the classified land use/cover maps for the Tano basin produced for the years 1986, 2010, and 2020. The basin was initially predominantly dominated by natural vegetation with several protected areas especially in the southern part, with few settlements and agricultural activities. Presented in Table 4   are the results for the area covered by each LULC type. In the year 1986, about 53.6% of the total area of the basin was occupied by dense forest, followed by open Forest (34.7%), with smaller areas occupied by cropland, water and settlement (Table 4 ). In the year 2020, open forest recorded the highest area coverage (39.2%), followed by dense forest (25.8%), settlement (20.3%) and other classes occupying smaller areas. Table 5   shows the changes in LULC and the rate of change over the period 1986 to 2020. The results show that between the years 1986 and 2010, about 26.5% of the Dense Forest in the basin was lost to open forest and settlement which showed an increase of 9.6% and 265.5% respectively. The southern part of the basin which was mostly covered by Dense Forest has now become Open Forest while settlement also expanded at the extreme north of the basin. During 2010 to 2020 period, a continuous decrease in dense forest (−34.6%) was noticed, especially in the southern and northwestern part of the basin. At the same time, open Forest has also been converted to cropland, while settlement also shows a similar increase (29.6%) at the extreme north of the basin. The decrease in the dense forest between 1986 and 2010 can be partlybe attributed to the increase in cropland. The rate of change in the LULC type was found to be higher for Dense Forest which shows a decrease of −298.4 km2  annually between 1986 and 2020, followed by open forest with an annual rate loss of 173.9 km2 , while cropland shows an increase at the rate of 24.8 km2 .   4 Discussion The LULC patterns and changes over the Tano basin were assessed for the historical period of 1986–2020. In general, the obtained results indicate that there is an increasing human influence in the basin through the development of settlements and cropland, which is causing a decrease in the forest area. According to WRC [12 ], land use in the Tano River basin is mostly agricultural, with extensive cocoa farming taking place in the protected areas. In the basin, Agriculture, particularly cocoa, plantain, cassava, maize and oil palm is the main source of employment accounting for about 70% of the Labour force [12 ]. This confirms the increase in cropland over the last 39 years in the basin, as also found by Awotwi et al. (2018) in the Pra River basin, an adjacent basin to the Tano basin. Another important activity in the basin is logging. This activity is mostly carried out on concessions granted to timber companies located within the forest belt. The people also rely on fuel wood as their main source of energy, which is obtained from the forest. All these human activities have contributed to the loss of dense and open forests in the basin. Previous research in Ghana has demonstrated how unsustainable agricultural methods and the expansion of cropland lead to a rise in CO2 emissions [23 ]. Therefore, the findings of this research can aid in evaluating and tracking the advancement of SDG 13's (Sustainable Development Goals). For instance, the continuous loss of forest cover in the Tano basin, as discovered by this research, is significant information for the development of indicators required to monitor pertinent CO2 emission goals under SDG 13 (climate action). In its current form (i.e., 2020), LULC can help decision-makers create effective forest management plans that will guarantee the achievement of CO2 reduction goals by 2030. The findings of this research will also produce outputs that will aid in the achievement of other SDGs when applied to biophysical models. For instance, earlier research (e.g. Ref. [24 ]) discovered that alterations in LULC (e.g. expansion in cropland and degradation of savanna), increase peak discharge and change people's risk of flooding. These changes can eventually have an impact on water resources in terms of quality and quantity. When suitable steps are taken to control deforestation and land degradation, risks related to climate change, such as floods and droughts, which have been on the rise recently [25 ], can also be reduced. Due to the Tano basin's ongoing population growth and the subsequent expansion of settlements, there will inevitably be a raise in food demand in the near future. To achieve this, policies that will boost agricultural output while preserving forest cover and cutting carbon emissions must be developed and promoted [26 ]. The following, among others, are some of the general areas for policy action in an effort to achieve economic prosperity and sustainable development because of the basin's abundant endowment of natural resources: (1) Natural resource management and mining, (2) Biodiversity management, (3) Protected Areas and Forest Management, and (4) Land Management and Forest Restoration. In this regard, the study will help the relevant national authorities to create the necessary natural resource policies necessary for the sustainable use of resources.  5 Conclusion This study demonstrated the use of remote sensing and Geographic Information System in mapping the LULC conditions of the Tano basin and the application of post-classification change detection technique to assess the changes in LULC between 1986 and 2020. In general, there was a significant decrease in dense and open forests in the basin. The conversion of forest (dense and open) to cropland and settlement is seen as the major historical LULC change that has occurred at the basin. The study's findings support the findings of earlier research that the study region is experiencing deforestation or loss of vegetation cover. The expansion in cropland and settlement in the study area is an indication of the increase in socio-economic activities and population in the area. The decrease in dense and open forests necessitates the use of sustainable agriculture land management (SALM) practice which can intensify production without necessarily converting the basin's remaining forest. This study only looked at the historical changes in LULC without factoring the future changes, which needs to be considered in future studies. Also, spatial changes in LULC was not captured which is also a limitation.
