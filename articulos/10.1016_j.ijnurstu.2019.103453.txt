In Europe, for example, a systematic review of several trials was conducted to compare physician-led-care with nurse-led-care under task shifting model in primary care (Martínez-González et al., 2015 ; Horrocks et al., 2002 ). These trials indicated that nurse led care which is mainly provided by nurse practitioners improved patients health outcomes similar to physician led care (Martínez-González et al., 2015 ; Horrocks et al., 2002 ). The nurse practitioners performed much higher in identifying abnormalities, completing records, communication, following treatment protocols and patients satisfaction as compared with physician led care (Martínez-González et al., 2015 ; Horrocks et al., 2002 ). The World Health Organization formally approved the Addis Ababa Task Shifting Declaration in 2008 as a widely accepted strategy of dealing with critical shortage of human resource for health. Task shifting – also known as task sharing – is the transfer of less specialized skills and tasks to less specialized and/or differently trained cadre of healthcare providers of various disciplines, particularly nurses and midwives (World Health Organization (WHO), 2008 ). The causes for initiation of task shifting and advanced practice role are similar, all including redistribution of tasks for improving healthcare coverage and quality through expanded scope of practice that is tailored to meet the demand for healthcare services. The need for providing primary care including care of acute illness, preventive care counseling and education , and continuing care for chronic disease  also led to the establishment of the advanced practice nursing/midwifery in several countries (Yankauer and Sullivan, 1982 ). Although the roles of advanced practice nurses and midwives are not simply defined by task shifting advanced practitioners like nurse practitioners and nurse midwives are often the first recipients of task shifting. The International Council of Nurses defines Advanced Practice/Practitioner as a registered nurse (at masters level and above) with the expert knowledge base, complex decision-making skills and clinical competencies for expanded practice (International Council of Nurses (ICN), 2008 ). The advanced practice role for nurses and midwives was established in different countries as early as 1940s (albeit informally). Though the roles began as a way to reduce the healthcare costs associated with physician delivered care, increase patient access to care (most often in rural areas), and address acute shortages of physicians (Horrocks et al., 2002 ; Yankauer and Sullivan, 1982 ) it has proved to be lifesaving and important for improving quality of care. The expansion of professional autonomy of nursing/midwifery and recognition of the existing expertise or practice are also crucial reasons for advanced practice. The Advanced Practice/Practitioners are prepared and endorsed by specific national authorities to work autonomously, make independent diagnoses, and decide on the treatment plan to provide patient care in an advanced and extended clinical roles (or other setting-education, research etc.) (Horrocks et al., 2002 ; Dolamo, 2018 ). Task shifting, however, can occur at any level of preparation for a nurse. It could include, but is not limited to, having community health workers conduct patient education for HIV/AIDS prevention or enrolled/practical/vocational nurses assuming responsibility for more complex intravenous infusions and medication administration responsibilities. In many cases, nurses and midwives are already performing various tasks out of their established scope due to the gaps in the labor market. Task shifting can formalize undertaking these tasks and provide nurses and midwives the required support for efficient execution of the roles. East African countries, like other sub-Saharan nations, face a critical shortage of healthcare providers and this problem is predicted to exacerbate (World Health Organization, 2009 ). Also similar to other countries, the acute shortages, the demand for Universal Health Coverage and primary care provision is heading to the redistribution of tasks among healthcare professionals including establishment of advanced practice nursing and midwifery. Both advanced practice nursing and task shifting are currently crucial in the East African region based on the high demand for fulfilling the Sustainable Development Goals and Universal Health Coverage. However, this development requires critical reflection and political positioning in terms of its effect to Nursing and Midwifery practice in East Africa. Nurses and Midwives comprise the largest group of healthcare professionals as in most countries, assume multiple responsibilities, spend more time with patients than most other cadres and, perform more wide range of clinical tasks in healthcare systems (Martínez-González et al., 2015 ). Unfortunately, there is limited evidence in this context about the outcomes of expanded roles to patient care provided by nurses and midwives or the consequences to the practitioners themselves. Although some low-income countries have realized the need for building capacity focused on encouraging evidence-based practice by nurses and midwives (Gray, 2019 ; Ridge et al., 2018 ), there are shortfalls in these nations. Notably, there is a challenge to balance the urgency of implementing the task shifting and health system strengthening, with formal educational preparation for these new roles. In addition, supportive policies to ensure that nurses and midwives in advanced practice are recognized and guided, based on the professional qualifications are lacking (Putturaj and Prashanth, 2017 ; Msuya, 2017 ). So far, only South Africa has well-established programmes in various advanced practice specializations in Africa (Dolamo, 2018 ; Gray, 2019 ). Several low- and middle- income countries are implementing task shifting and advanced practice nursing approaches for achieving Universal Health Coverage whilst also meeting the Sustainable Development Goals without policy frameworks or legislation (Putturaj and Prashanth, 2017 ; Giramonti and Kogan, 2018 ; World Health Organization (WHO), 2017 ). World Health Organization's Global Strategy on Human Resources for Health: Workforce 2030 and the Global Strategic Directions for Strengthening Nursing and Midwifery 2016–2020 is currently working to ensure the availability of quality, cost-effective and acceptable nursing and midwifery care based on community needs (World Health Organization (WHO), 2017 ). The World Health Organization envisaged that a greater political will, effective leadership and an enabling environment is required to ensure that nurses and midwives are adequately motivated, satisfied and empowered to discharge their duties effectively in order to meet the Sustainable Development Goals and Universal Health Coverage (World Health Organization (WHO), 2017 ). An example where this vision applies in the Tanzanian healthcare system is the dominating medical model, where doctors/clinical officers are main decision makers of patients care and leaders in all healthcare facilities regardless of competencies, experience and capacities in leadership. This has negative consequences to nurses and midwives including unnecessary delay in decisions related to care. Subsequently patients are affected by this situation, which may sometimes result into reduced access to care, long waiting time for consultations and denied services. This traditional model undermines the major contributions and capacities, which nurses and midwives have in the Tanzanian health systems. Efforts need to be directed into patient care outcome against power dynamics and protection of professional territories. We propose that the efforts to achieve Sustainable Development Goals and Universal Health Coverage are dependent on the establishment of the advanced practice nursing/practitioners’ role and task shifting in countries that have not officially adapted the system or where the role is in a nascent form (World Health Organization (WHO), 2017 ). The support for development of professional infrastructure and the evaluation of the effectiveness of expanded roles is necessary to ensure patient safety and quality care and a critical part of capacity building in health for the region (Ridge et al., 2018 ). These efforts may include, but are not limited to, standards of legislation, accreditation to institutionalize and acknowledge the services and expertise of advanced practice nursing and all who are involved in task shifting, as well as certification and graduate level education (Putturaj and Prashanth, 2017 ; Dolamo, 2018 ). Standardized educational preparation and adequate training is the cornerstone for meeting these requirements.  2 A case example: the advanced practice nurse and midwife role in East Africa Generally, the task shifting practices are extensive in all health facilities across all cadres of health workers in East Africa particularly in HIV/AIDS and, reproductive and child health services in urban and rural areas (Jonathan et al., 2016 ). In Tanzania, there is a defined scope of practice derived from structured task shifting that has fostered the development of advanced practice nurses and midwives (Tanzania Nursing and Midwifery Council (TNMC), 2014 ). The research evidence and anecdotal data show, however, that nurses and midwives perform several advanced roles including prescribing and minor surgical procedures often without educational preparation and recognition (Msuya, 2017 ). Similar to other low income countries, policy frameworks, legislation, and standards for professional practice in the new roles is lacking and require policy adjustments as well as the development of legal protections in the extended new roles (Jonathan et al., 2016 ). Tanzanian scholars recommended the development of policies and guidelines for structuring the implementation of task shifting in the country. Nonetheless, the necessary work to help with the harmonization of important aspects of the expanded roles including educational programmes/training, mentorship and supervision is still in progress (Msuya, 2017 Jonathan et al., 2016 ). Innovative educational curricula within the context of East Africa are required to equip nurses and midwives in advanced practice roles with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to address healthcare demands and socio-political contextual issues more effectively and efficiently. The potential aspects of the curricula should be considered to focus on building the capacities for: Innovation, Leadership, Politics, Pluralism of thought, theory, Interdisciplinary/Intradisciplinarity within program and Public health. This is also in line with Sustainable Development Goals 3 target 3, which stresses on the development of adequate training, education and skills which are relevant to the needs of the population and the profession (World Health Organization, 2016 ). This investment for better health will contribute to improved economic growth and achievement of other Sustainable Development Goals (World Health Organization, 2016 ). To succeed as a strategy, task shifting and advanced practice role development in the profession must be simultaneously accompanied by curriculum development that is specific to the local context, facilitates knowledge transfer to practitioners in ways that can scale up services as quickly as possible, and is accompanied by policies, regulations, and legislation that protects both nurses/midwives and patients. This will complement the recommendations from research and anecdotal evidence in East Africa, which suggest granting autonomy for practice through legislation for advanced practitioner roles. The training of the advanced practitioners in Nursing and Midwifery will support the efforts in transforming the health system and improve health outcomes.  3 Conclusion Nurses and midwives are critical for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and Universal Health Coverage. While the task shifting may be conceptually impressive both for meeting the health agenda in the region as well as for patients and professionals, performing this informally may be catastrophic in terms of quality of care for patients and the protection of the professionals involved. Put simply: task shifting requires strengthening the non-physical aspects of health system infrastructure in order to optimize its effects on patient outcomes and population health.
