                  Increased policy coherence and integrated implementation are necessary to address pressing development problems that cut across different sectors. Meeting these demands, as called for by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, requires institutional innovation. Based on the comparative analysis of 137 countries, this paper investigates how governments have responded to this call and which contextual factors shape their institutional responses. We propose a four-dimensional typology to analyse the institutional set-ups for implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), focusing on political leadership, horizontal integration across policy sectors, vertical integration across levels of government, and integration of societal stakeholders. We apply this framework to the descriptions of national SDG-implementation bodies provided by governments in their Voluntary National Review (VNRs) and use qualitative directed content analysis and regression modelling to investigate different driving factors of institutional design choices, including socio-economic development and political regime. Besides a strong commitment from the Centre of Government in most cases, our results show that ministries of the exterior and the environment have a dominant role, indicating that sustainability is not yet perceived holistically. Further, we find that the integration of subnational governments and societal actors is often under-institutionalised: while countries with higher levels of socio-economic development appear more likely to set up mechanisms suited to achieving cross-sectoral integration, political regime type seems to have little impact on institutional design choices for SDG implementation. Conceptually, this study offers a theory-led investigation of the institutional mechanisms for integrated SDG-implementation and the factors that drive institutional innovation or inertia. Empirically, by compiling the information in an original dataset, our study paves the way for future cross-national analysis on effective integrated SDG implementation and identifies entry points for inter- and transnational support of integrated SDG implementation in the context of development cooperation.

Increased policy coherence and integrated implementation are necessary to address pressing development problems that cut across different sectors. Meeting these demands, as called for by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, requires institutional innovation. Based on the comparative analysis of 137 countries, this paper investigates how governments have responded to this call and which contextual factors shape their institutional responses. We propose a four-dimensional typology to analyse the institutional set-ups for implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), focusing on political leadership, horizontal integration across policy sectors, vertical integration across levels of government, and integration of societal stakeholders. We apply this framework to the descriptions of national SDG-implementation bodies provided by governments in their Voluntary National Review (VNRs) and use qualitative directed content analysis and regression modelling to investigate different driving factors of institutional design choices, including socio-economic development and political regime. Besides a strong commitment from the Centre of Government in most cases, our results show that ministries of the exterior and the environment have a dominant role, indicating that sustainability is not yet perceived holistically. Further, we find that the integration of subnational governments and societal actors is often under-institutionalised: while countries with higher levels of socio-economic development appear more likely to set up mechanisms suited to achieving cross-sectoral integration, political regime type seems to have little impact on institutional design choices for SDG implementation. Conceptually, this study offers a theory-led investigation of the institutional mechanisms for integrated SDG-implementation and the factors that drive institutional innovation or inertia. Empirically, by compiling the information in an original dataset, our study paves the way for future cross-national analysis on effective integrated SDG implementation and identifies entry points for inter- and transnational support of integrated SDG implementation in the context of development cooperation.

The problem of interlinked development goals has been prominently discussed in relation to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (see Breuer, Malerba, Srigiri & Balasubramanian, 2023 ). To date, however, there are no clear conceptual proposals on how to address the institutional challenges posed by the interlinkages between the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and their targets, nor is there a comprehensive overview of the institutional approaches the agenda signatories have chosen. This paper aims to contribute towards closing these conceptual and empirical gaps. In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic once again cast a spotlight on the fragility of the interdependent global socio-economic and environmental fabric. The numerous interactions between environment, society, and economy give rise to systemic risks (Morton et al., 2017; Nilsson et al., 2016; Pham-Truffert et al., 2020 ). Mitigating these risks and building towards a sustainable future requires effective institutions and governance approaches that integrate the efforts of actors from different sectors , who are active at all levels of government, combined with scientific expertise (de León et al., 2021; Independent Group of Scientists appointed by the Secretary-General, 2020; IRGC, 2018; TWI2050, 2020 ). These are not new revelations brought about by the pandemic. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), adopted in 2000, committed nations to a global partnership to reduce extreme poverty by 2015. While the MDGs led to progress in some areas (e.g. maternal health and access to drinking water), poverty remains a reality for many. Critics point out that the MDGs identified sectoral goals yet paid little attention to the impact that progress on a goal in one sector would have on those in another (Weitz et al., 2014 ). This siloed, sectoral approach undermined the potential to address the drivers of systemic change and to scale impact through more programmatic approaches (Hazlewood, 2015; TWI2050, 2020 ). Another frequently mentioned shortcoming of the MDGs’ process was its lack of legitimacy and ownership, which resulted from the failure to meaningfully include the very constituents that the MDGs sought to address. Establishing the MDGs as shared worldwide goals, with progress measured in mostly nationally aggregated data, failed to pay due attention to individual national and regional needs and obscured inter- and intra-country disparities (Fehling et al., 2013 ). The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted in 2015 as a follow-up to the MDGs, builds on lessons from the MDG process. It recognises the indivisibility of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the related need for integrated implementation approaches (Article 13, 2030 Agenda), as well as for inclusive, participatory, and representative decision-making at all levels (SDG 16.7). The 17 SDGs and their 169 associated targets constitute a complex system of interlinked development objectives. The practical implementation of such an ambitious development vision poses new challenges to political institutions and processes. To simultaneously achieve the SDGs, innovative governance approaches are necessary in order to exploit synergies and mitigate trade-offs between and within the SDGs and their targets (Leininger et al., 2018 ). Although sustainable development and the acknowledgement of systemic risks have been on the international agenda since the 1990s, no substantive progress towards policy integration has been made. Reforms have primarily focused on elements of good governance, such as efficiency and the accountability of state institutions, which are conceived as preconditions for effective development policies (Fukuyama, 2016, p. 91 ). Despite continuing efforts to coordinate policies for national development between sectors and actors, the political and administrative intent to integrate different sectors remains limited (for an overview, see Candel, 2017; Candel & Biesbroek, 2016; Tosun & Lang, 2017; Trein et al., 2018; Ugland & Veggeland, 2006 ). To date, the implementation of development policies in many countries is therefore far from integrated and still characterised by sectoral approaches as well as clearly delineated ministerial responsibilities. The reasons for this institutional inertia are manifold and can include transaction costs, uncertainty of outcomes, path dependence, power of vested interests, and lack of legitimacy (Munck af Rosenschöld et al., 2014 ). Consequently, trade-offs between policy goals are often not dealt with explicitly, sometimes even undermining the achievements of other goals (Breuer et al., 2019 ). The need to minimise trade-offs became evident in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Pandemic control measures, such as stay-at-home orders and the closure of non-essential businesses, proved to be effective in controlling the spread of the COVID-19 virus, thus contributing to the combat of communicable diseases as set forth in SDG 3.3 (Conyon et al., 2020; Dave et al., 2021; Fang et al., 2020; Juranek et al., 2020 ). However, these intervention policies also had a negative impact or even reversed progress on a considerable number of economic and social objectives, such as SDG 1 on combating poverty, SDG 2 on ensuring food security (Sumner et al., 2020; WFP, 2020 ), SDG 4 on providing quality education (Psacharopoulos et al., 2020; UNESCO, 2020 ), SDG 8 on promoting sustained economic growth (World Bank, 2020 ), and SDG 16 on advocating for peace, justice, and strong institutions (e.g. Varieties of Democracy, 2021 ). To address such trade-offs, it is essential to integrate interests and goals in a contextually sensitive manner, not only in the design of post-pandemic recovery plans, but also in future resilience-building strategies and longer-term national planning. Obviously, this can only happen where adequate mechanisms and structures exist to support these efforts. Target 17.14 under Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) of the 2030 Agenda calls on all countries to enhance policy coherence for sustainable development. The agreed global indicator 17.14.1 intends to measure the “number of countries with mechanisms in place to enhance policy coherence of sustainable development” (on the status of the development of the global methodology for this indicator, see UNEP, 2020; United Nations, 2020 ). Countries have been creating national bodies to coordinate SDG implementation since late 2015, but many are yet to transform their newly created legal frameworks into operational institutions. It is thus too early to make empirically substantiated statements about how effective these emerging institutions will be in simultaneously achieving the interrelated SDG, although recent research indicates that the political impact of the SDGs has thus far been largely discursive, whereas more profound normative and institutional impact remains rare (Biermann et al., 2022 ). In a first step, and as a basis for future analyses on effectiveness, it is important gain an overview of the institutional designs currently in place. The institutional challenges associated with integrated SDG implementation have been addressed in several international policy reports (among them CCIC, 2018; GIZ, 2020; Niestroy et al., 2019; OECD, 2016; United Nations, 2018 ), which focus on different selections of countries as well as on different dimensions of policy integration and policy domains. What these reports have in common is that they describe the mechanisms and challenges of SDG implementation from the perspective of governance and policy. However, the comparative evidence presented by them remains either limited geographically, focussing on a subset of countries based on their membership in international organisations or unions (e.g., Bickler et al., 2020; Niestroy et al., 2019; OECD, 2016 ), or limited temporally by focussing on specific years of Voluntary National Review (VNR) submission (e.g., CCIC, 2018; GIZ, 2020; United Nations, 2018 ). Yet gaining the full picture of institutional designs for policy coherence in SDG implementation across different world regions, levels of development, and points in time is highly relevant for two reasons. First, it allows us to establish a baseline for future empirical analyses that assess the effectiveness of different institutional models for integrated policy implementation in development cooperation in general and for SDG implementation in particular. Second, the establishment of a database that compiles systematic information on institutional designs from a sufficiently large sample of countries will also facilitate future quantitative analyses that investigate how contextual factors (such as regime type, state capacity, country income group, level of development, and geographical location) shape governments’ institutional choices vis-à-vis the attainment of SDG implementation. A clustering of countries according to socio-economic and political context factors, for example, would make it possible to develop systematised reform options and recommendations for countries with similar constellations, thereby enabling more efficient and more context-sensitive policy advice (for example, Paasi, 2005 ). This would help to identify entry points for inter- and transnational support to integrated SDG implementation (see, for instance, Tosun, 2013; Tosun et al., 2019; Tosun & Peters, 2018 ). Analysis on the impact of geographical and temporal factors, to give another example, may reveal temporal or geographical spill-over effects indicative of international institutional learning. Such effects could be further supported by peer networks (such as the “UNGA and ECOSOC Group of Friends on VNRs”) or the creation of transnational administrations (for instance, Stone & Ladi, 2015 ). Against this background, the aim of this paper is twofold: 1) to make a conceptual contribution by offering a typology of the institutional designs of national regimes for the integrated implementation of sustainability policies such as the Agenda 2030; 2) to make an empirical contribution by applying this typology to 137 country cases and compiling the information in an original dataset (available from the authors upon request), thus paving the way for future empirical analyses, such as a cross-national analysis on effective integrated policy implementation or qualitative studies on institutional patterns for integrated policymaking. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: in the next (second) section, we introduce a four-dimensional typology of national bodies for SDG implementation and formulate our research hypotheses. In Section 3 , we introduce the data and methods used in the empirical analysis. Section 4  presents and discusses results. Section 5  concludes by summarising major achievements and gaps regarding institutional pre-conditions for integrated SDG implementation, formulating related policy recommendations, and providing an outlook on future research needs.  2 Institutional designs for policy integration: A typology and hypotheses on design choices As outlined in the previous section, the SDGs were established on the central insight from the MDGs process that systemic change cannot be reached through single-sector approaches. Given its indivisible nature, implementing the 2030 Agenda will require the dismantling of traditional silos in order to achieve policy coherence across different policy sectors, government levels, and societal actors (Dodds, 2015; ECOSOC, 2018 ). Overall, there is consensus that a truly integrated implementation of the SDGs will require deep institutional reform and innovative institutional approaches (TWI2050, 2020; United Nations, 2020 ). As countries are still experimenting with the best means of delivering on the 2030 Agenda (Persson et al., 2016 ), there is still no single institutional model that has been empirically proven to be the most efficient with regard to addressing the implementation challenges of the SDGs (OECD, 2016 ). However, previous research on the effectiveness of development policies as well as policy reports and speeches at high-level international events have consistently highlighted four factors as crucial for achieving the SDGs. These are: High-level political leadership (see Abbott & Bernstein, 2015; United Nations, 2018 ). Horizontal coherence across policy sectors (see United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), 2017 ). Vertical coordination across levels of state and government (see International Science Council (ICSU), 2017 ; United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), 2017 ). Multi-stakeholder engagement (Beisheim & Simon, 2016 ; Dodds, 2015; Stafford-Smith et al., 2017 ). 2.1 A four-dimensional typology of national bodies for integrated SDG implementation Building on the above findings and applying common sense in policymaking, we propose a four-dimensional typology for the categorisation of national bodies for SDG implementation that considers four dimensions of policy integration. The rationale underlying the choice of these dimensions is described in the following section. 2.1.1 Political leadership The most important place for horizontal policy coordination and management of horizontal issues is generally assumed to be located at the Centre of Government (CoG), that is, the chief executive and the central agencies serving that executive (OECD, 2016; Peters, 2015 ). However, prime ministers and presidents themselves often merely play a symbolic role in these policy processes. They normally do not possess the capacity to produce effective coordination as they have insufficient time resources to coordinate the numerous activities of the ministries under their oversight. Rather, they establish teams, organisations, or agencies that assist them in this task, such as ministries or general-secretariats of the presidency, offices of the president or prime minister, or cabinet offices. It is important to note that structural definitions of CoG categorise only those institutions as belonging to the CoG that directly and exclusively support the head of government, such as offices of the presidency or prime minister. Functional definitions, by contrast, also categorise institutions as belonging to the CoG if they perform supra-sectoral, whole-of-government functions, particularly in respect of planning, coordination, political management, or monitoring, such as ministries of planning or finance (Alessandro et al., 2013 ). In this paper, we adopt the latter functional approach. Research on the National Councils for Sustainable Development (NCSD), which were created in the follow-up of the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, indicates that support and leadership by the CoG is conducive to effective policy coordination. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) (2017), for example, finds that NCSDs that were located within a specific sector ministry did not often have the necessary political power to effectively coordinate sustainable development matters, whereas countries that located their NCSDs under the Office of the President or Prime Minister ensured effective coordination. In a similar vein, Osborn et al. (2014)  found NCSDs with ministerial members to be a useful means of securing an integrated government approach to sustainable development when led or given strong support by a head of state. By contrast, according to these authors, NCSDs composed exclusively of prime ministers found it hard to develop the necessary longer-term vision that transition to sustainability requires. Another important aspect mentioned in the literature is the key role of finance and planning ministries (Cheru, 2006; Swanson et al., 2004; Whitfield, 2009 ). As these authors explain, the cross-cutting vision and specific objectives formulated in a national sustainable development strategy will likely remain at the periphery of government decision-making if they are not adequately considered in budget planning and fiscal priority-setting. On the downside, relying exclusively on the CoG for policy coordination may produce adverse, centralising effects. Sometimes the source of conflict over certain issues and policies can be more easily identified at lower working levels of government. Where this is the case, by the time the CoG learns about a conflict, valuable information about what actually caused the conflict may have been lost and, with it, the government’s ability to solve the coordination problem that caused the conflict. As Peters (2015)  appropriately puts it: “The top-down approach common to coordination may often not match the bottom-up reality of the problems” (ibid., p. 75). With a view to efficient coordination, it thus appears that national bodies for SDG implementation should enjoy support from the highest level of government while being composed in a way that allows sector ministries and subnational bodies to bring in both their expertise and their practical working experience. Regarding the dimension of political leadership, it is therefore essential to ask the following questions: Where in the executive is the national body for SDG implementation located? Who presides over the body?   2.1.2 Horizontal integration Given the interlinked character of the 2030 Agenda, it is frequently postulated that SDG implementation bodies with an inter-ministerial, cross-sectoral set-up should be better suited to identifying cross-cutting issues and addressing linkages and interdependencies between the SDGs and their targets than those that are located in a single specific ministry (OECD, 2016; UNDESA, 2018; United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), 2017 ). This claim is supported by research on the National Sustainable Development Strategies (NSDS) of the 1990s and early 2000s. In their comparative analysis of 19 NSDS of developing and developed countries, Swanson et al. (2004) criticise that these strategies typically focused on only one or two dimensions of sustainable development. While national environmental strategies were sophisticated in their understanding of sustainability principles, they were usually weak in understanding their linkages with the social and economic dimensions of sustainable development. Similarly, Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP) considered social and economic aspects but generally offered little in the way of environmental aspects. In a similar vein, (2010) Gjoksi et al. (2010) , who compare the NSDS of 29 European countries, find that, typically, ministries of the environment oversaw the implementation and monitoring of these processes. Since they belong to the weaker ministries in many countries, ministries of the environment often found it necessary to court more influential actors to gain support. Consequentially, according to the authors, the disadvantaged negotiation position of environmental ministries often led to a “watering down” of NSDSs (Gjoksi et al., 2010, p. 5 ). These findings suggest that national bodies for SDG implementation will only be able to balance the interdependencies between the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of the 2030 Agenda if they profit from the expertise and experience of the relevant ministries active in these areas. Regarding the dimension of horizontal integration, it is thus essential to ask: How many, and which ministries, are formally represented in the national body for SDG implementation? Which ministry, if at all, has the political power to make decisions?   2.1.3 Vertical integration There is broad agreement in the international policy community that an integrated implementation of the 2030 Agenda will require policy coherence between different levels of government (Pisano et al., 2016 ) (for example, OECD, 2016; UNDESA, 2018 ). The majority of SDGs involve both a subnational and local dimension. Local governments play an important role in formulating, implementing, and providing services (see, e.g., Beck and Ferasso 2023; Beck et al. 2023 ). They are thus crucial in strengthening the ownership and legitimacy of SDG policies, as they link the implementation of the Global Agenda to the needs of the local communities that are affected by and can profit from these policies (UNDESA, 2018 ). For this reason, strategic and effective national action for sustainable development needs to catalyse action at the subnational and local levels and manage interdependencies between these levels (Ongaro, 2015; Swanson et al., 2004 ). However, vertical integration comes at a cost. Decentralising the responsibility for SDG implementation to lower levels of government may require the creation of additional structures, legislation, and regulation, along with monitoring and evaluation. Moreover, it may be difficult to coordinate and align SDG action at different levels of government due to their diverging policy priorities and political agendas; in fact, such an undertaking might even run the risk of diluting the very SDG action it seeks to facilitate (UNDESA, 2018 ). Based on research on national climate mitigation action, Pisano et al. (2016) , for example, caution that vertical integration may not be appropriate in all contexts or at all stages in the design and implementation of sustainability action. Another caveat is related to the integration of subnational institutions in developing countries: since these entities often lack human capacities and the financial resources necessary to fulfil their mandates, their integraton might prove ineffective. These concerns can be reflected in the formal structure of national bodies for SDG implementation. Since national governments may shy away from giving subnational governments a permanent seat at the table, including a formal voice and vote, they might opt instead to collect the input of subnational governments by means of technical working groups without formal decision-making power. Alternatively, they may choose to involve them for a limited period of time or for specific purposes, such as for national consultation processes aimed at prioritising SDG action, to disseminate information and raise awareness, or for monitoring and evaluation. Regarding the dimension of vertical integration, it is thus essential to ask the following question: Are subnational governments formally and permanently represented in the national body for SDG implementation, or are they members of permanent working groups that report to the national body?   2.1.4 Societal integration Throughout the 1990s, growing consensus emerged that traditional governmental approaches were no longer sufficient for managing sustainable development (Dodds, 2015 ). As a result, today, the demand to apply a governance approach and formulate as well as implement the SDGs with the widest possible societal participation – from contestation to decision-making power – is almost ubiquitous in policy reports and government documents dealing with the 2030 Agenda. The rationale behind this demand is that societal participation is indispensable if policy is to be integrated (Nordbeck & Steurer, 2015; Tapaninaho & Kujala, 2019 ). There is general agreement that building the integrated visions and strategies needed to support sustainability transformation requires a broad societal consensus that can only be achieved through the engagement and inclusion of major societal groups, including businesses, trade unions, academics, and civil society organisations. In addition, compliance with the principle of “leaving no one behind” will also require engagement with the full diversity of societal stakeholders, including representatives of marginalised and minority groups (UNDESA, 2018 ). At the most basic level, awareness about and ownership of the SDGs by the whole of society needs to increase if the 2030 Agenda is to succeed. Not less importantly, addressing the investment gap for attaining the SDGs will not be possible without the engagement of the private sector (Sachs & Schmidt-Traub, 2015 ). Clearly, building situations in which public, social, and private stakeholders from the same sectors and across sectors pool their resources and competencies to address the SDGs commonly and effectively will require building institutional frameworks and structures that are able to reconcile and integrate the diverging needs and interests of these stakeholders (Herrera, 2019; Gordon & Johnson, 2017 ). Research on integrated strategies in European environmental policymaking during the 2000s observed considerable variation among institutional approaches to involving stakeholders in sustainable development processes (Nordbeck & Steurer, 2015 ). With regard to timing, for example, stakeholder participation was most common in the phase of formulating national sustainability strategies but often petered out afterwards (Gjoksi et al., 2010; Raggamby & Rubik, 2012 ). While some countries relied on punctual and temporary participation via roundtables and conferences, others opted for a longer-term institutionalisation of stakeholder participation via National Councils for Sustainable Development. Another form of bringing key actors of civil society, governments, and business together is through public–private partnerships (PPP) or multi-stakeholder partnerships (MSP) for sustainable development. A cross-national study by Pattberg et al. (2012)  found that such partnerships were mostly implemented in Organization of Economic Development (OECD) countries, rather than in least developed countries. It is also important to note that multi-stakeholder engagement does not only entail benefits but also comes with certain risks. Most frequently mentioned are the potential negative side-effects that come with private sector involvement (refer to Beisheim & Simon, 2016 ; Pattberg et al., 2012 ). As the authors of ECOSOC (2018, p. 5)  put it: “Private sector financing of the SDGs has its limits in the profit maximising rationale of private sector activities, as ultimately the SDGs are public goods that cannot become bankable projects.”. Regarding the dimension of societal integration, it is thus essential to ask the following questions listed in Table 1   below: The empirical analysis presented in section four of this paper will answer these questions.   2.2 Institutional designs and the political factors that shape them: Hypotheses This analysis presumes that countries have adopted different institutional arrangements to coordinate the different sectoral policies addressed by the SDGs. We contend that these cross-country differences result from deliberate institutional design decisions made by national governments, as postulated by scholars such as Howlett et al. (2015); Chindarkar et al. (2017) and von Lüpke et al. (2022) . Such design choices are interdependent because decision-makers take into consideration the benefits and costs of their actions and act accordingly (North, 1990 ). The literature on policy design offers insightful reflections on the drivers of design-related decisions and stresses that not only functional considerations play a role for them but also political ones. While it would be plausible to hypothesise that political considerations are equally important for explaining national governments’ choices regarding the design of institutional arrangements, we here limit ourselves to the first perspective, which stresses the relevance of functional considerations. We consider this focusis substantiated by two considerations. First, the empirical basis of the present study are VNRs, which are prepared according to guidelines provided by the United Nations. What is more, national governments are aware that the VNRs they submit are reviewed and also need to be updated. We therefore expect countries to present the institutional arrangements for delivering the SDGs in a manner which argues that they are functionally or technically appropriate given their respective level of capacity and knowledge (on the latter see Röser et al., 2020 ). Second, we contend that it is important to first understand the extent to which functional considerations play a role before expanding the underlying theoretical model to include political considerations as well. Thus, our theoretical considerations depart from the assumption that national governments deliberately choose institutional arrangements to deliver on the SDGs and that these considerations are based on functional considerations. Drawing on this logic, we posit that national governments choose to establish an institutional design that prioritises either the national level (horizontal coordination) or the subnational level and non-state actors (vertical and societal coordination). This has been shown, for example, by von Lüpke et al. (2022) , who identified that the institutional arrangements for climate change adaptation focus on policy implementation, while those for climate change mitigation give priority to policy formulation. Adam et al. (2019)  argue that transaction costs are important for explaining coordination arrangements. Transaction costs will always incur with coordination arrangements; this holds particularly true for the SDGs, as the 2030 Agenda explicitly asks for the adoption of an integrated and coherent approach (SDG target 17.4). However, governments can choose whether they (mostly) incur at the stage of policy formulation or policy implementation. Governments who are willing to bear the coordination costs at the stage of policy formulation will adopt institutional designs that focus on the coordination and potentially even cooperation (see Tosun & Leininger, 2017 ) of the pertinent line ministries. Several studies have also shown that coordination between different line ministries entails costs and that these costs increase the greater the number of line ministries (see, e.g., Ssennyonjo et al., 2022; Zubek, 2005 ). Based on these considerations, we postulate a trade-off between horizontal coordination on the one hand and vertical and/or societal coordination on the other. H1a: The greater the number of line ministries involved in the implementation of the SDGs, the lower the likelihood of the involvement of subnational entities . H1b: The greater the number of line ministries involved in the implementation of the SDGs, the lower the likelihood of the involvement of non-state stakeholders.  Conversely, national governments who give priority to policy implementation should choose a design that stresses a combination of vertical and societal coordination. Given that subnational entities often lack capacity, national governments may choose to compensate for this by introducing institutional arrangements that give a stronger role to civil society organisations, thus moving from a government-oriented approach to a governance-oriented one (see, Di Gregorio et al., 2019; Eckersley, 2016 ). Consequently, we expect national governments who attribute a central role to subnational entities to do the same for non-state stakeholders and vice versa. In this way, a more capable institutional arrangement can be achieved without having to invest in the subnational entities. H2a: The inclusion of non-state stakeholders increases the likelihood of involving subnational entities in the implementation of the SDGs.  H2b: The inclusion of subnational entities increases the likelihood of involving non-state stakeholders in the implementation of the SDGs.  The two main hypotheses are represented in Figure 1   below. In addition to the interdependent institutional choices formulated in the hypotheses, we analyse potential alternative explanatory factors of design choices. An argument made frequently is that the design of institutions depends on state capacities (see Chindarkar et al., 2017; Fukuyama, 2017 ). Countries with a well-equipped and capable public administration should be in a position to propose more complex institutional designs that better address the mandate of the 2030 Agenda to pursue cross-sectoral policy integration. Considering again the costs associated with institutional design (see Pierson, 2000 ) and the path dependency of institutional choices (Steinmo, 2008; Thelen, 1999 ), we expect attributes of the political system (government system and political regime) and the state organisation (centralised versus federal) to influence the institutional design choices for SDG implementation. In general, we assume that institutions for SDG implementation are part of the political system and state organisation. As such, their functions, composition, and design are likely to be adapted to the systemic and organisational context of a specific country. However, a systematic analysis of how these factors interact in institutional design choices is beyond the scope of this paper.   3 Data and methods The present analysis focuses on the institutional designs that governments have proposed for national SDG implementation bodies. To collect the necessary data, we conducted a qualitative, directed content analysis of the VNRs presented to the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) between 2016 and 2019. For this, we used the qualitative data analysis software ATLAS.ti. Directed content analysis is an established method for investigating a phenomenon on which prior research is incomplete or which would benefit from further description (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005 ). During this period, just over 70% of UN member states submitted at least their first VNR. Our database is therefore sufficiently broad to allow for the identification of general global trends. The total number of countries covered by our original dataset is 137; for each country we use the latest available VNR (at the time of writing). The VNRs were coded by at least two persons separately and checked afterwards for consistency by a third person. When inconsistencies were observed, a fourth person (who in each case was one of the authors of this study) made an executive decision on the final coding of the data point concerned. In light of the nature of the documents coded, the authors had to make executive decisions regarding ambiguous coding in about 20 per cent of all data points. This is because the wording of the VNRs is more open to interpretation than we had originally anticipated. Nonetheless, the fact that the data were coded by multiple coders, combined with our own expertise regarding the characteristics of the data, makes us confident about the quality of the database. The instructions according to which the data were coded were also subject to iterative processes, whereby the initial guidelines were revised multiple times in order to ensure that they were easy to understand and implement. In sum, the database is likely to represent a solid base for empirical analysis. For the quantitative analysis described below we used the software STATA. Our analysis rests on four dependent variables, which are based on the rationale of the four dimensions of policy coherence introduced in Section 2  (political leadership, horizontal integration, vertical integration, and societal integration). For an overview, see Table 2  . First, political leadership  refers to the mandate of the 2030 Agenda, the establishment of the institutional set-up for SDG implementation, and the responsibility to oversee the implementation of the SDGs. In our coding, political leadership takes the values 0 to 3, indicating whether no leadership of the implementation process is assigned (0), leadership is assigned to the CoG (1), to one or several line ministries (2), or to both the CoG and line ministries (3). In Table 2  we included the political leadership variable just described (0–3), and also the sub-variables for when leadership is assigned to the CoG (Leadership COG) or to one or more line ministries (Leadership Ministry (both sub-variables are dummy variables coded 0–1). Second, horizontal integration  refers to the number and type of line ministries represented in the national SDG-implementation body. Our data differentiate between the categories of economy, the environment, society, and sustainability, as well as between foreign ministries and the residual category of other ministries. In cases where ministries mentioned in the VNR are responsible for two of these six categories, we assigned them to one category only. More specifically, we assigned them to the category that was mentioned first. This was only the case in two instances, where the ministries in charge of environmental issues were also in charge of sustainable development. When the VNRs mentioned any of these ministries as being represented in the national body for SDG implementation, we assigned them the value 1 (and 0 otherwise) and then computed the count variable on that basis. Third, our indicator for the dependent variable vertical integration  is the involvement of subnational entities in the implementation process. Our coding categories differentiate between membership in the national SDG-implementation bodies themselves and membership in permanent working groups or technical committees that report to these national bodies. The variable vertical integration is coded in a binary manner, taking the value 1 if subnational entities are members of the national SDG-implementation body itself and 0 if they were merely organised into permanent working groups or technical committees. Our fourth dependent variable, societal integration , refers to the involvement of non-state stakeholders. Our coding scheme differentiates between stakeholders from the categories of science, business, academia, development cooperation, and intergovernmental organisations. With regard to the latter two categories, considering that we had several least developed countries in our sample, we believed it was important to account for the involvement of this type of actor as well. For the present analysis, we condensed these categories into a single category termed societal integration. As with vertical integration, this variable was coded in a binary manner, taking the value 1 if non-state stakeholder were members of the national SDG-implementation body itself or 0 if they were merely organised into permanent working groups or technical committees. Based on our hypotheses, we identified eight relevant control variables (for some of these variables, the external data used were missing for a few countries). A country’s level of socio-economic development was our first independent variable since we expect this to impact actors’ willingness to accept the financial transaction costs of institutional reform. We use two indicators to measure socio-economic development: the two social dimensions of the Human Development Index (HDI), which refer to education and health. The greater the values reported in Table 2 , the lower a country’s human development level. Furthermore, we use the income categories of the World Bank to measure the level of economic development. The World Bank’s Income Groups differentiate between low-income countries, middle-income countries (lower and upper), and high-income countries. We expect a higher state income to result in more capable and effective institutions. The subsequent variables all refer to political regime. The reasoning here is that democratic political regimes, which by definition open political processes to non-state actors, can be expected to choose an institutional design which allows for civil society participation. Conversely, autocratic regimes are less likely to open their policy processes to societal actors, unless they restrict societal participation. The costs of including societal actors in an open, unrestricted manner are too high in autocratic regimes because opening up the regime might cause changes in the power structures and thus endanger the position of power holders (Olson, 1993 ). The data for our political regime control variable are taken from the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) project (Pemstein et al., 2018 ). The political regime is measured with the Electoral Democracy (vdem_partdem) and Liberal Democracy (vdem_libdem) indices of V-Dem. Similar to the previous measurement, higher values indicate higher levels of electoral or liberal democracy. The data are used as given and not modified by mathematical operations such as natural logarithms. We also use data on government fractionalisation, political stability, government system, and heterogeneity. Among other things, we expect centralised states with no additional autonomous units to be likely to maintain their basic design choice and thus be likely to favour exclusive institutional arrangements. Conversely, systems that are decentralised with autonomous units favour more inclusive institutional designs as they already have such arrangements in place. In addition, autonomous units should have financial resources which are independent from the national units of government. Their resources are, thus, crucial for SDG implementation. In light of the measurement level of the data and their distributional characteristics, we fitted maximum-likelihood-based regression models to test our hypotheses. To examine the determinants of horizontal integration, we computed Poisson regression models for count data. The characteristics of the data allowed us to fit a regular Poisson model and did not require negative binomial models or zero-inflated models. Turning to vertical and societal integration, the binary coding of the dependent variable required the fitting of logistic regression models. Despite the relatively small number of observations, all models performed well. However, we had to adjust the estimation models slightly for the dependent variables in order to optimise the model fits. We ran several regressions using an increasing number of control variables, which were not available for all countries. Therefore, the results of the different models may not be fully comparable.  4 Results and discussion 4.1 Assessment: Types of governance regimes for SDG implementation In this section, we identify the different types of governance regimes for SDG implementation by using descriptive statistics. We start by identifying the composition of national SDG-implementation bodies and its implications for our first dependent variable, political leadership . Figure 2   gives an overview of how often the individual line ministries are mentioned in VNRs as being members of the national SDG-implementation body, as a percentage share of total VNRs. We can infer from the bar graphs that the ministries of foreign affairs and environmental protection are mentioned most frequently. The assignment of responsibility to the ministry of foreign affairs is plausible considering that the SDGs are an international policy agenda, which will require a considerable degree of coordination among implementing states. On the other hand, it raises the question of whether national SDG-implementation bodies represent – to some extent – an effort to showcase activities related to the 2030 Agenda internationally, rather than being an attempt to achieve cross-sectoral policy coordination domestically. The prominent role of environment ministries suggests that the 2030 Agenda is still mainly perceived as an environmental agenda, which is interesting considering the wide range of topics covered by the SDGs. The above identified predominance of the ministries responsible for foreign affairs and the environment even persists when we inspect the descriptive statistics of our dependent variable political leadership, that is, for those line ministries that are indicated as presiding over the national body for SDG implementation. It is worth examining the issue of political leadership  in more detail. In fact, in our sample of 137 countries, 84 assigned the leadership to the CoG, which as per our definition frequently involves national ministries of planning and/or finances, 25 countries assigned leadership to one or multiple line ministries, and 19 assigned it jointly to the CoG and line ministries. The VNRs of 9 countries do not clarify the question of political leadership. Therefore, with regard to our first research question, we can highlight two features of the institutional design of the SDG implementation regime: first, the majority of countries assigned the leadership to the CoG; second, the assignment of leadership to the CoG does not automatically entail that no or only a small number of line ministries are involved. In fact, we observed the involvement of line ministries in about 74 per cent of all cases. In most of these, it was the ministry of foreign affairs and/or the environment ministry that played a key role, but the picture is mixed, with other ministries being relevant as well. We will examine more systematically below whether the assignment of leadership explains the number of line ministries involved. Figure 3   presents the distribution of our dependent variable horizontal integration  as a histogram, that is, the number of line ministries represented in the national body for SDG implementation. We can see that the distribution of the data is skewed, as we have more observations for smaller numbers of ministries than for greater numbers. The category with the highest frequency is the one where no line ministry was involved in the implementation process. This distributional property needs to be taken into account when fitting the estimation models. The mean value of the number of ministries represented in the SDG-implementation body is 2.3 (with a standard deviation of 1.96). In sum, we can state that in the great majority of cases (namely 74 per cent), at least one line ministry was represented. Consequently, we are confident that it is appropriate to concentrate on the line ministries in order to examine the degree of horizontal integration. An even more detailed insight is offered by Table 3  , which gives an overview of the distribution of the individual countries along four dimensions. The first of these is the number of line ministries represented in the national SDG-implementation body, which is shown by the horizontal axis, which captures the dimension of horizontal integration within our typology. The vertical axis then captures different combinations of the remaining three dimensions: the involvement of the CoG (that is, the dimension of political leadership); the involvement of subnational entities (that is, the dimension of vertical integration); and the involvement of civil society (that is, the dimension of societal integration). Given our interest in specific constellations of these three binary variables, we present the eight (23 ) possible constellations in which they can emerge. The most exclusive constellation is one where neither the CoG (=0), nor subnational entities (=0), nor civil society actors (=0), nor any line ministry is represented in the SDG-implementation body (in fact, this would most likely indicate the adoption of a decentralised approach to SDG implementation in which no specific body had been set up or mandated with coordinating SDG implementation). We coded as “0″ constellations in which subnational entities or civil society actors were represented in working groups or committees but not in the national body. We assumed that being represented in the national body makes a substantial difference because subnational entities and civil society actors do not take part in political decision-making over SDG implementation if they are only represented in working groups and committees. The opposite, most inclusive scenario is one where CoG, Vertical Integration, and Societal Integration all have a value of 1 and three or more line ministries are represented. These two constellations can be considered as extreme types of institutional design choices for SDG implementation. The remaining categories are hybrid forms, which tend to be either more exclusive (if it has only one dimension, it takes the value of 1) or more inclusive (if it has two dimensions, it takes the value of 2). It should be noted that a constellation in which only subnational entities were included was not observed in our data. Remarkably, the largest group in our sample by far corresponds to the more exclusive types, where the CoG is involved but neither subnational entities nor civil society organisations enjoy formal decision-making power in the national SDG-implementation body. Within this group, the majority of country cases fall into the group where three or more ministries are involved. The second largest group refers to the constellations in which the CoG as well as non-state stakeholders are represented in the SDG-implementation body. Within this group, we also have the most instances of three or more ministries being involved. Two more constellations are worth mentioning: Switzerland, Canada, and Hungary on the one hand and the Netherlands on the other. In the former case, we observed no formal representation of actors other than line ministries in the national SDG-implementation body.1  1 In both VNRs, the authors state that civil society actors will be represented in the implementation process but do not specify how.   However, in both cases, the number of ministries involved was on the higher end, with three or more. The institutional design in the Netherlands was also interesting, as the VNR neither mentions any line ministry nor CoG institution as a member of the national body for SDG implementation; instead, it gives subnational entities and non-state stakeholders formal representation. Table 3  presents the descriptive statistics of the variables that entered our analyses as dependent or independent variables. The first three variables – horizontal integration , vertical integration,  and societal integration  - serve as dependent variables, but they will also enter the analyses as explanatory variables.  4.2 Driving factors: What matters for horizontal and vertical integration? We would like to begin the discussion by explaining the horizontal integration  of the line ministries involved in the implementation of the SDGs (Table 4   below). To this end, we must inspect the results of the Poisson models fitted. The coefficients are reported as odds ratios and therefore take only positive values. Odds ratios smaller than 1 indicate a negative relationship between a covariate and the dependent variable and odds ratios greater than 1 point to a positive relationship. Leadership is strongly related to the number of line ministries. Compared to a baseline scenario of no leadership, CoG leadership is the one with the smaller effect, though it still has an odds ratio higher than one and is thus statistically significant. Leadership of ministries and joint leadership of ministry and CoG have similar coefficients, higher than 1. All these coefficients are statistically significant. The electoral democracy index has a weak statistically significant coefficient, as it is lower than 1, and therefore denotes a latent tendency of democratic regimes to distribute power across ministries. Being a higher income country increases the odds that a greater number of line ministries are involved, assuming the other predictor variables in the model are held constant. In terms of the HDI, it depends on the controls and the sample of countries used. The other control variables (government fractionalisation, political stability, heterogeneity) are not statistically significant. In sum, these findings show that leadership type plays an important role for the number of ministries involved. Turning to our hypotheses on vertical integration, we obtained the following findings (see Table 5  ). If line ministries are assigned the leadership in the SDG implementation process, the odds of subnational entities being included in the relevant governing bodies are very close to one though not statistically significant. One likely reason for this is that a strong relationship between political leadership and a higher number of line ministries absorbs coordination capacities, which leaves fewer incentives to include subnational units and societal actors. Another reason might be that governments focus on policy formulation in their institutional design choice, which requires a greater involvement of ministries than does SDG implementation. In contrast to Hypothesis 1a, while the number of line ministries involved does not possess any explanatory power for vertical integration, countries that involve civil society have higher odds of including subnational entities. In these countries, the odds of involving subnational entities are between 5 and 9 times higher than in countries that abstain from involving civil society. The other variable that results statistically significant (but just at the 10% level) is liberal democracy and the electoral democracy index: higher values for both indices are related to higher vertical integration of subnational entities. As discussed above and outlined in Table 5 , there is a relationship between vertical and societal integration (hypothesis H2a and H2b). This relationship is confirmed by the analysis of societal integration as presented in Table 6  , since countries that involve subnational entities in the SDG implementation process have about 7.5 times greater odds of involving civil society actors, too. Leadership from a ministry also has a significant (at the 10% level) but negative effect. Although involving civil society should be more likely in democratic regimes given the democratic principles of participation and political equality, regime type had no explanatory power for societal integration in this model. To summarise, the analyses presented in tables 4 to 6  reveal two important insights: first, a national government’s likelihood of integrating line ministries in a broader horizontal manner is most strongly related to the country’s level of socio-economic development and its political stability. With regard to the latter, surprisingly, it is less  stable countries that tend to adopt more extensive horizontal integration. This finding is quite counterintuitive and further research will be required to understand the mechanisms that drive horizontal integration. Second, while there is no relationship between horizontal integration and the other two types of integration, we observed a stable and mutually enforcing relationship between vertical and societal integration. This finding speaks to our hypothesis that national governments who attribute a central role to subnational entities will do the same for non-state stakeholders and vice versa. In this way, by moving from government-oriented approach to a governance-oriented approach, more capable institutional arrangements can be achieved without having to invest in subnational entities with low capacities..   5 Conclusions 5.1 Main findings In this study, we posed two research questions: the first referred to the empirical characteristics of institutional designs for policy integration within the context of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. On the basis of a typology developed by us for this purpose, which we applied to the VNRs submitted to the United Nations from 2016 to 2019, we were able to show that the national governments concerned made various institutional design choices. The largest group of the countries analysed in this study (15) opted for an institutional design that ensured high-level political leadership by the CoG along with horizontal integration through the formal engagement of three or more line ministries. However, subnational units and civil society stakeholders were not formally represented in this approach. With seven years to go until 2030, no single institutional model has yet been empirically proven to address the implementation challenges of the SDGs most efficiently. However, the literature on the effectiveness of development policies and previous sustainability efforts, reviewed in Section 2  of this paper, alludes to the importance of four factors (high level political leadership, horizontal and vertical integration, societal inclusiveness) for successfully implementing the SDGs in an integrated fashion. Our analysis has shown that only a relatively small number of countries (six) opted for a design that complied with all four of these factors. The second research question concerned the determinants of these patterns. Our findings revealed that, first, horizontal integration becomes more likely with higher socio-economic development. Second, when governments operate in a politically stable environment, they are less likely to spread the responsibility of implementing the SDGs across many different line ministries. Third, wertical integration and societal integration are interdependent and mutually enforcing. Overall, we were able to witness some innovative approaches to the challenging task of attaining sustainable development. Evidently, in the present analysis, we were not able to discuss the performance  of the respective institutional models, as the process of adopting and refining the institutional design for SDG implementation is still ongoing in many countries and it is too early to conduct empirical studies evaluating the effects of institutional design on SDG achievement.   6 Limitations It is important to note that as an empirical basis, the VNRs themselves are fraught with certain limitations. Given the voluntary nature of reporting and the lack of thorough accountability mechanisms in the SDG process (see Breuer & Leininger, 2021 ), it is difficult to judge to what degree VNR reporting adequately reflects what is happening on the ground. Through our own field research as well as our experience in consulting with and supporting governments of different countries in their VNR preparation processes, we have learnt that what is stated in these documents sometimes surpasses reality. In some cases, for example, isolated information events staged for a handful of representatives of selected civil society organisations are presented in the VNR as broad-based civil society participation processes. In other cases, we found that the SDG implementation bodies described in the VNRs either met infrequently or were unable to carry out the extensive tasks assigned to them due to their inadequate staffing and funding (Breuer & Oswald-Spring, 2021 ; Srigiri, Breuer & Scheumann, 2021 ). Further limitations of this study include the relatively preliminary conceptualisation of our independent variables. Although we used established indicators for some of them, others, such as state capacity, must be refined for the purpose of answering our specific research questions. Future research and contributions to theory building . Against this background, the typology created for the purpose of this study as well as the original database built upon it lay the groundwork for future research. Such empirical research should seek to verify whether the institutions established to implement the SDGs are also being used to integrate sustainability policies in the longer term, or whether they were in fact “empty institutions” (Dimitrov, 2020 ) whose establishment merely sought to showcase a country’s SDG efforts internationally. Furthermore, our study indicates that financial state capacity is crucial for the establishment of more complex institutional designs. Future research should thus also aim to consider the role that a state capacity exceeding a country’s level of socio-economic development plays in influencing national design choices regarding institutional sustainability architectures.  Another factor worth exploring is a country’s level of dependency on official development assistance (ODA). It cannot be ruled out that there is a connection between the need to attract donor funding on the one hand and the willingness to align national institutional frameworks with internationally set goals on the other. Research in these directions could help to refine governance theories concerned with explaining different governance strategies, such as goal setting. Altogether, rather than offering conclusive findings, this study represents a first venture into the theory-led, empirical investigation of the institutional conditions required for the integrated implementation of SDGs as they are currently emerging, along with the factors that drive institutional innovation or inertia. Policy implications . The findings of the empirical analysis of institutional designs for integrated SDG implementation have various implications for policymaking at the national and global levels. Implementing a global agenda locally requires the careful choice of ministries to lead the process. In 27 of the 62 cases from our sample, ministries of foreign affairs lead SDG implementation. This suggests that although the Agenda 2030 is supposed to be implemented in both domestic and global arenas, nearly half of the governments we analysed perceive it primarily as an international agenda. While international action is crucial for addressing the global problems formulated in the SDGs, the domestic arena must not be left behind for several reasons. First, holding governments accountable for SDG implementation requires strong domestic accountability relations between state and society. Second, a firm implementation of SDG policies is an important element in preparing individuals and societies for an active role in the transformation to sustainability. Sharing responsibilities for SDG implementation between ministries of foreign affairs and ministries dealing with domestic affairs is thus a necessary condition for successful SDG implementation. Choosing lead ministries beyond “the usual suspects” (such as ministries of the environment and foreign affairs) will be necessary in order to address the key dimensions of the 2030 Agenda.  Environment ministries rank second after foreign affairs in leading SDG processes in the countries analysed. Although the high responsibility of environment ministries might increase synergies with the Paris Agreement, there are downsides to this approach. Environment ministries typically belong to the “weaker” ministries, which have to court the support of stronger ministries. This had led, in the past, to sustainability strategies being watered down (that is, less environment, more economics). Ministries should thus be mandated in a way that all three dimensions of the 2030 Agenda (economic, social, ecological) are covered. Consequently, for international development cooperation, negotiations with implementing governments should foster the involvement of particularly relevant line ministries in the national institutional design for SDG implementation. This aligns with the argument made by other authors that the emerging concept of a sustainability state requires new institutions, structures, and policies beyond those of traditional environmental policy institutions (Biermann, 2021 ; Mathis, Rose, Bauer, 2022 ). Make sure relevant non-state and local stakeholders are involved in national decision-making.  A considerable number of countries have chosen an institutional design in which three or more sector ministries are involved in the implementation process. These are, at least theoretically, favourable conditions for horizontal integration. However, a meaningful integration of subnational entities and civil society actors is still lacking. Although these are often integrated in working groups and committees, they have no say in decision-making processes on the national level. Given the high relevance of local solutions for SDG implementation and the constructive role that non-state actors – including epistemic communities – have been playing in formulating and raising awareness for the SDGs, they should be part of the decision-making processes. The emerging trend of the submission of Voluntary Local Reviews (VLR) to the HLPF since 2020 is a welcome development in this direction. However, vertical integration is not only a question of political willingness and power; it also requires improving local capacities. In particular, local institutions in developing countries can often not participate in political decision-making because of a lack of human and financial resources. This recommendation resonates with SDG 17, which calls for multi-stakeholder partnerships for SDG implementation. From the perspective of international development cooperation, it is crucial not only to negotiate and cooperate with governmental bodies on the national level, but also to expand cooperation for SDG implementation to subnational entities and civil society actors. That said, the examples of Switzerland and Chile show that OECD donor countries themselves do not necessarily have a better record in vertical integration than developing countries. Integrating sub-national entities and civil society remains a universal task for all types of countries. Monitor the establishment of institutional designs for integrated SDG implementation.  In many countries, new institutions have been established with the aim of integrated SDG implementation, at least on paper. However, it is too early to tell if these institutions have actually become operational, work effectively and efficiently, and are a relevant point of reference for a country’s policymaking. Given the general consensus that strong institutions are crucial for SDG implementation, it is necessary not only to develop indicators for measuring the achievement of the SDGs themselves but also to assess the strengths of the institutions charged with SDG implementation and whether these institutions actually make a difference. This is particularly salient considering that the national institutional designs for integrated SDG implementation vary with regard to age and level of innovation. In some countries, governments have established new institutions to oversee and coordinate SDG implementation, whereas in others this mandate has been conferred on previously existing institutions whose structure was not (or only slightly) changed. Other countries simply extended the mandate of existing institutions for the purpose of national development planning or implementing national climate strategies. However, literature on economics and natural resource government has shown that institutional path dependence may create rigidity even within new institutional arrangements (see, for example, Godden et al., 2011; Schreyögg & Sydow, 2010 ). In light of this, and given that we still know very little about the effectiveness and efficiency of the various SDG implementation regimes, it will not only be important to monitor their impact but also to investigate the political dynamics, constellations, and logic that led to their adoption.
