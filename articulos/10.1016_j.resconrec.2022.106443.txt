                  Urban society, infrastructures, and their energy and water systems are interconnected, whose performance can be measured by United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 6–13. However, few studies have systematically investigated sustainable development at the city level, especially in China. To fill this gap, we adopted the SDG framework to establish holistic urban metrics tailored to China's context. We empirically examined the city-level scaling effects and found that the urban metrics of China's prefectural cities basically fit into the scaling theory, that socioeconomic attributes are in super-linear relations with population while urban infrastructures show sub-linearity. Moreover, when the effects of per capita built-up area and GDP are controlled, the population still correlates to many metrics. This study provides a more nuanced understanding of urban scaling patterns, considering China's unique city governance regime and land-centered urbanization pathway when evaluating their sustainable development progress, which helps inform custom-fit planning strategies for a better future.

Urban society, infrastructures, and their energy and water systems are interconnected, whose performance can be measured by United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 6–13. However, few studies have systematically investigated sustainable development at the city level, especially in China. To fill this gap, we adopted the SDG framework to establish holistic urban metrics tailored to China's context. We empirically examined the city-level scaling effects and found that the urban metrics of China's prefectural cities basically fit into the scaling theory, that socioeconomic attributes are in super-linear relations with population while urban infrastructures show sub-linearity. Moreover, when the effects of per capita built-up area and GDP are controlled, the population still correlates to many metrics. This study provides a more nuanced understanding of urban scaling patterns, considering China's unique city governance regime and land-centered urbanization pathway when evaluating their sustainable development progress, which helps inform custom-fit planning strategies for a better future.   Keywords Urban scaling  Sustainable development goals  Prefectural cities  China    1 Introduction Rapid urbanization propelled by globalization and the booming population has brought global problems such as climate change, a shortage of natural resources, deteriorated public health, and so forth (Wiedmann and Allen, 2021 ). Among these overwhelming challenges, a major obstacle is meeting the basic needs of increasing urban populations while ensuring the integrity of ecosystems. The United Nations launched the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Transforming our World , a 2015 report set a 2030 deadline to end poverty, hunger, and address environmental problems such as climate change. These SDGs provide a holistic and comprehensive framework including 17 goals, 169 targets, and 231 indicators to benchmark, monitor, implement and evaluate the sustainability progress among nations to the year 2030. However, as this 10-year deadline is approaching, few signs indicate that such goals will be achieved on time. The Global Sustainable Development Report (GSDR) in 2019 pointed out the difficulty in addressing all SDGs simultaneously since many of them are in conflict (Messerli et al., 2019 ). For example, the environmental protections of SDGs are in competition with the gross domestic product (GDP) goals in some cases. Moreover, the world has not yet been systematically on track with the efforts and achievements of these numerous targets that comprise the SDGs, which brings alarm to the international community. The downscaling practices of SDGs to cities have emerged owing to the feasibility of implementation at a more localized scale and the profound influence of cities. Research has projected that cities will accommodate 70% of the world's population and produce 85% of global economic output by 2050 under current trends (Messerli et al., 2019 ). In particular, Goal 11 (Sustainable cities and communities) addressed these opportunities for cities and put urbanization of cities at the heart of achieving SDG goals. Moreover, many other SDGs are highly relevant to sustainable cities, such as water and wastewater treatment (SDG 6), energy and technology development (SDG 7, 8 & 9), inequalities reduction (SDG 10), sustainable consumption and production (SDG12), and climate change actions (SDG 13). Prioritization of the SDGs related to water, energy, infrastructure and society can offer opportunities to achieve sustainability at the city scale with efficiency in consideration of synergies realization and trade-offs avoidance. Moreover, many studies have emerged to explore ways of evaluating city-level sustainable practices. For example,Wiedmann and Allen (2021)  summarized the potential to use city footprints in assessing city sustainability; Jiang et al. (2022)  adopted fine-scale spatial maps to construct Chinese cities’ sustainability indices to capture local and regional variations, etc. However, since the initial SDGs aim to achieve and implement targets at the national level, downscaling SDGs to the city level faces many challenges. First and foremost, cities are complex entities whose social, infrastructural, and economic facets are strongly interconnected (Bettencourt, 2013 ). In this sense, policies and perceptions to treat problems related to urbanization and global sustainable development independently can lead to undesirable, sometimes disastrous consequences (Bettencourt and West, 2010 ). Second, the integrated implementation of city-specific values, goals, and solutions is deficient, albeit indicator sets for measuring sustainable cities are proliferating. Lastly, the scaling effects of urban development add up a new layer of complexity in downscaling SDGs to cities. Unlike SDGs measurement of nations, which can commonly use a unified standard, cities of different sizes exhibit varying inner development logics. For example, the urban population of Beijing in 2015 was 3.32 times that of the people residing in Nanjing City, while the road length of them is only 1.04 times the difference (Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of China, 2015 ). Their relative population and road length are not proportional. Similarly, the larger per capita GDP value of big cities does not suggest that they economically perform better than small or medium-sized cities. Thus, it makes no sense to directly compare the absolute values of SDGs of cities. Instead, the impact of city size should be eliminated when comparing cities’ sustainability progress. Urban scaling theory has witnessed that cities show essentially different agglomeration efficiencies and scaling laws in economic activities, land development patterns, infrastructure construction, and environmental impacts in response to population levels (L. Dong et al., 2017 ). More explicitly, these scaling relations between population and varying urban attributes can be classified into three regimes (Bettencourt, 2013; Bettencourt and West, 2010; Wiedmann and Allen, 2021) . Firstly, the socioeconomic activities show super linear growths with urbanization level, indicating the increasing returns to scale and higher productivity. Secondly, the infrastructural networks such as wastewater discharge, gas supply pipeline length, and the built-up areas, scale sub-linearly with urban population. The sub-linearity means the increase of urban attributes shrinks if the population of a city grows by a unit, thanks to the higher density of settlement and more intense usage of infrastructure. Lastly, individual human needs, such as jobs, housing demands, and water consumption, do not deviate significantly from the linear scaling relationship with population (Bettencourt, 2013) . Urban scaling law has also become a quantitative tool to explore the interdependence of urban organization and its spatial, infrastructural, and socioeconomic components. While urban scaling theory illuminates our understanding concerning the scale effects of different characteristics of cities, how to cohere the scaling patterns with sustainable development indicators as recapped by the SDGs framework can be challenging. In one way, China, in particular, is among one of the fastest-developing and populous nations with a unique urbanization context compared to the rest of the world. China has its distinct city formation mechanism and different definitions of ‘city’ (Lei et al., 2021 ). For the western counterparts, post-industrial cities are defined because of their functions, that a city is a geographically self-organized non-rural economic system comprised of densely populated urban core and the continuous residential and industrial suburbs (Chan and Wan, 2017 ). However, the Chinese ‘city’ is defined as a level of the administrative region within the state hierarchy below the province (Cai and Zhang, 2014 ). The boundaries of cities can be arbitrary, which are set administratively by the governments. Thus, the different definitions of cities in China and the west bring another level of complexity to downscale the SDGs framework from nations to cities and to link the urban scaling theory to evaluate the sustainable development progress of Chinese cities (Cottineau et al., 2017 ) In the other way, China has its unique urbanization process. Researchers pointed out that land use and population are two crucial organs of cities (Lang et al., 2019 ). Accordingly, China has advanced its urbanization level through two main pathways. One is economic development, which is attributed to the rural population flowing into urban areas for jobs. The other is urban spatial expansion dominated by the urban governments to convert massive rural land into urban built-up areas (Feng et al., 2019 ). These two processes usually happen asynchronously. Thus, the scaling factor correlated to the population in scaling theory is a combined coefficient, including the effects of built-up area, the GDP, and population per se . In such a way, the urbanization of a city can be decomposed into socioeconomic activities (reflected by the GDP) and tangible construction (reflected by the built-up area), whose scaling patterns with population have been widely discussed in urban scaling theory. Our research interest is more about the remaining effect of population on the performance of varying urban indicators, independent of the built-up area and the GDP. To fill the aforementioned gaps, this paper aims to answer the following research questions: a) how could we construct indicators to measure SDGs in relation to water, energy, infrastructure, and society for Chinese prefectural cities? b) What are the population scaling patterns of China's city-level sustainable development indicators? c) How could we explain these scaling patterns, and what are the policy implications? We first established metrics focusing on sustainable cities based on SDGs framework goals 6–13 with the reference to the UN SDG dashboard (UNSC), which is one of the most comprehensive and widely used frameworks to quantify SDGs. In total, we drew out 49 urban metrics that are highly relevant to city-level sustainable development for these eight SDGs in China, and that can be downscaled at the prefecture-city level. Each goal contains 2–9 indicators (see details in Materials and Methods). We then collected relevant data for the 297 prefectural cities of China for the year of 2015 (excluding Hongkong, Macau, and Taiwan). To the best of our knowledge, this study is a pioneer in evaluating the baseline city-level sustainability performance, incorporating urban scaling theory with the downscaling of the SDGs framework. In response to the different delineation of ‘city’ in China, we differentiate the urban regions into two types (Qu and Xu, 2021 ). One is Urban Administrative Districts (UADs), which define city in a top-down way and are commonly used in The China Urban Construction Statistical Yearbook. UADs refer to the actual construction within the fixed administrative boundary of cities, under the jurisdiction of a neighborhood committee that is connected to the district or city government's residences. The other is the Highly Urbanized Urban Administrative Districts (Highly UADs) of Chinese prefecture-level cities. They are characterized by a higher urbanization rate and more mature infrastructures (Lei et al., 2021 ). Cities under this definition are comparable to the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) of the United States (Dong et al., 2017 ) and is thus more conformed to the condition of urban scaling law. Correspondingly, we then ran two sets of regression analyses for the two spatial calibers. Methodology and data are presented in Section 2 . Results as shown in Section 3 . Section 4  presents the conclusions and discussions. Then some policy implications in steering sustainable development targeting cities are drawn in Section 5 .  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Establishment of urban metrics for benchmarking China's prefectural-level city sustainability progress Urban metrics were first selected from a range of resources that summarize SDG indicators at the national level, including the United Nations’ official list of global SDG indicators (United Nations Statistics Division, 2017 ), the 2018 SDG Index and Dashboards Report (UNSC) (Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017 ), and SDG indicators and Monitoring Framework from Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) (Schmidt-Traub et al., 2015 )), referring to Xu et al. (2020) . We then screened out city-level indicators based on the US cities Sustainable Development Report from the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) United States (Lynch et al., 2019 ), which is operated under the supervision of the United Nations, aiming to build pathways to achieve the SDGs through collective actions such as research and outreach. These reports provide robust and comprehensive quantitative methods to measure SDGs at the national and city levels and have been widely adopted in peer-reviewed papers. Lastly, we referred to other resources such as the UN Human Settlements Programme (United Nations Human Settlements Programme, 1996; United Nations Centre for Human Settlements 1997) , Urban Sustainability Indicators (USIs)(Huang et al., 2015 ), and so forth (Cohen 2017 ; Giles-Corti et al., 2020 ; Huovila et al., 2019)  to construct as many indicators as feasible from their recommended lists and in consideration of the data feasibilities. Following this approach, we collected 49 urban metrics in total for SDGs 6–13 at the prefectural city level in China. These indicators are listed as E, C, and N, indicating ‘exactly match’, ‘closely match’, and ‘not match’ to reflect how they are matched with SDG indicators in SDG Index and Dashboards (UNSC) at the national level. Exactly matched indicators are collected in round 1, closely matched ones are collected from round 2, and so forth. The list and details of indicators and their matching information are shown in the supplementary spreadsheet.  2.2 Regressions analysis 2.2.1 Regressions for population scaling with SDG indicators To estimate the scaling relation of the city-level urban indicator to SDG Yi  per capita to population Ni , we used the regression equation (a),(a) log  ( Y i  N i   )   =  log Y 0    +  β log  N i   + ε  i       In Equation a, Ni  is the key role to explain a city-level urban indicator Yi . A total of 49 urban indicators are collected in the previous step. The relationship should be Yi  / Ni  = Y0 Ni β , given that Y0  and β are constants. If β = 0, the scaling is simply linear. If β < 0(>0), the scaling is then sub-linear (super-linear); that is, Yi  / Ni  decreases (increases) as the population grows. The error term is represented by ε  i     2.2.2 Regressions for contributions of population, GDP, and built-up area to SDG urban indicators We focus on the Highly UADs for this analysis, where the urban population density is high and is more capable of representing the proper urban environments. Elasticities of the city-level per capita Yi  to per capita GDP and per capita build-up area are estimated from the linear ordinary least squares (OLS) regression Equation (b) with population Ni  controlled. c   is a constant, and the error term is presented as δ i   (b) l o g ( Y i  N i   )   =  c  +  β 1  l o g ( G D P i   N i   )   + β 2  l o g ( A r e a i   N i   )   + β 3  l o g ( N i  )   + δ i        We further decompose the differences of the scaling exponent gained from Equation b from 0 to estimate the effects of the per capita GDP, per capita built-up area, and the population, using the following relationship in regression Equation (c):(c) β ^  Y  = β 1  ^  Y  * β ^  G D P   + β 2  ^  Y  * β ^  A r e a   + β 3  ^  Y        Where β 1  ^  Y   and β 2  ^  Y   are the OLS estimators for elasticities of a city-level per capita urban indicator Y i    to per capita GDP and built-up area from the Equation (b). β ^  Y  ,  β ^  G D P      and β ^  A r e a    are Equation (a)’s estimators for scaling coefficient β .  β 3  ^  Y     is the population estimator in Equation (b). For example, we read from Table 1   that the scaling coefficient of Sidewalk Area (PC) (34) with urban population change is -0.149. This is a combined coefficient including the effects from per capita built-up area, the per capita GDP, and population per se . We then calculate the scaling coefficients of Sidewalk Area (PC) with respect to per capita built-up area, and the per capita GDP are -0.192 and 0.177. Table 2   indicates that the elasticities of per capita sidewalk area to per capita build-up area, per capita GDP, and the estimator for the population term are 0.494, 0.462, and -0.136, respectively. Thus, we calculate the effect of per capita built-up area change due to the population on the sidewalk (PC) by multiplying the scaling coefficient with the elasticity, which is -0.095 (-0.192 × 0.494). Similarly, such effect of per capita GDP is 0.082 (0.177 × 0.462), and the effect of the population is -0.136, independent of the former two factors.   2.3 Data sources Data were mainly obtained from the 2015 China Urban Construction Statistical Yearbook  (2015 ) and the 2015 China City Statistical Yearbook  (National Bureau of Statistics, 2016 ) for 297 prefectural level cities in China. The former, published by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of China, provides data on built-up area, gas supply, water use, wastewater discharge, domestic waste, and pipeline lengths for gas, water, and drainage. The latter is published by the National Bureau of Statistics of China and provides data on GDP, population, land, employment, etc.   3 Results 3.1 Urban sustainability metrics concerning China's prefectural cities and spatial distribution of their sustainability performance The entire established metrics contain 49 SDG indicators in total. Details such as descriptive statistics of each indicator in Goals 6–11 and their definition, calculation, unit, and sources are provided in the supporting spreadsheet. We have collected 2–11 indicators for each SDG 6–13. Remarkably, some indicators that were not included in UNSC but still selected in our metrics were out of concerns such as data availability and their strong relevance to the sustainable development measurement at the city level. SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) has the most indicators (11 in total), while SDG 13 (climate action) has the least (2). The 11 indicators in Goal 11 cover 5 targets, and each target has 2–3 indicators. Among them, 9% are exactly matched with the UNSC List, 73% are closely matched, and 18% are not matched. It is noticeable that data related to Goal 13 is quite limited in China. Only two indicators are closely matched to the UNSC List. The particular reason may lie in the difficulty of data collection concerning Goal 13, which further implies the overall data limitation or even absence in China concerning the measurement of city-level climate action. These findings call for more strict enforcement in data monitoring, collection, and disclosure in the future. Figs. 2 -9 in Supporting Information (SI) present the overall descriptive statistics concerning the different SDGs. The spatial distribution of different SDG indicator values provides a holistic picture of how Chinese cities performed in the varying sustainable development fields in 2015 and how effective our metrics are. We demonstrate two representative indicators in Goal 6 and Goal 13 in Fig. 1  . For example, the spatial distribution maps concerning the two indicators of SDG 13, namely the CO2 emission per capita for both scope 1 and 2, show similar spatial patterns (Figs. 1 (a) and (b)). The conclusion indicates the similarity of these two datasets related to Goal 13, which implies the ineffectiveness of them in portraying a thorough picture of how actions coping with climate change were taken in Chinese cities. Take Goal 6: Sustainable Water and Sanitation as another example. Indicator 4 Water Use per GDP measures the water use efficiency. It is calculated by the Water Supply (10,000 tons) divided by the Gross Regional Product (10,000 yuan). Indicator 7 Water Stress Index is a measure of water resource scarcity. It measures the freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources of a city. It is calculated by Water Supply (10,000 tons) divided by Total Water Resources (10,000 cu.m). As shown in Fig. 1 (c), Northeastern Chinese cities have the largest number of places categorized into the highest Water Use per GDP group (red dots).In the meantime, their Water Stress Index belongs to the lowest category, see Fig. 1 (d) (blue dots). In contrast, some cities such as Beijing and Tianjin in the North China Plain experience high water stress (red dots) while their water use per GDP is moderate to high (blue or green dots). In this sense, we recommend to implement water use efficiency improvement policies in cities located in the North China Plain, considering their more tremendous potential in water conservation.  3.2 Scaling patterns of the different urban attributes with population Major urban indicators are statistically significant in scaling with the urban population  As shown in Table 1 , most urban indicators are statistically significant in scaling with the urban population. 42 out of the 49 indicators show a statistically significant relation with p-values less than 0.05 in at least one regression. These results validate our established indicator metrics for evaluating urban sustainability progress in Chinese cities. Among those 42 indicators with statistical significance, 7 show a robust scaling relationship with urban population, having p-values less than 0.05 in all regressions for both UADs and Highly UADs, and regressions before and after the correction of heteroskedasticity (Indicators 1, 4, 7, 12, 25, 37 and 46). Thus, we are highly confident that these seven indicators of Chinese prefectural cities (that the public service sector of clean water availability and sustainable management of sanitation, and access to affordable and clean energy, etc.) satisfactorily fit urban scaling theory with the expansion of city size measured by the urban population size. Moreover, Chinese cities follow scaling patterns in building infrastructure, promoting economic growth, fostering industrialization, and constructing sustainable cities and communities with at least one robust and reliable significant regression. Urban attributes show different scaling regimes. Among these 42 indicators with significance, 28 urban indicators scale super-linearly (β > 0), and 14 indicators scale sub-linearly (β < 0). The scaling exponents of urban indicators related to socioeconomic activities, such as GDP growth (percentage)(14), Foreign Capital Utilized (PC)(17), Subscribers of the Internet (28), and Cellphone (PC)(29), are positive (β > 0), follow the super-linear scaling relations as proposed by existing allometric scaling researches. This superlinearity indicates a higher return of urban population agglomeration (Arcuate et al., 2015 ). In addition, urban attributes related to energy consumption and pollution generation present sub-linear scaling relations (β < 0), such as Water Use per GDP (4), Electricity Consumption per GDP (12), etc. However, some urban indicators slightly deviate from the predictions of conventional urban scaling theory. For example, indicators related to individual needs, such as Unemployment Rate (percentage)(18) and Household Waste Harmlessly Treated (percentage)(39), should exhibit linear scaling relations(β = 0) (Ortman et al., 2014 ). However, the scaling exponents of these urban indicators are noisy, and no significant linear scaling relations are found. The remaining 7 out of 49 indicators are not well served in fitting urban theory, such as in goals of promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth and inequality elimination(Indicators 5, 11, 15, 16, 39, 42, and 44). The potential reasons vary, including but are not limited to inaccurate data collection, the confusing definition of ‘city’ in different contexts, or other factors. SDGs 7, 9, and 10 perform better in larger cities while others are not  In theory, as the urban population aggregates, the socioeconomic growth rates increase, technological development, and improved energy utilization or consumption efficiencies are also expected accordingly. In addition, the more intense urban form and pipeline networks are also conducive to more efficient natural resource utilization. We label these changes as activities towards sustainability (shaded in green in Table 1 ). In contrast, over-exploitation of natural resources, climate change, and other problems undermining sustainability are shaded in red. As demonstrated in Table 1 , all urban indicators in SDGs 7, 9, and 10 with significance are considered sustainable (shaded in green ). These indicate that Chinese cities did well in accessing affordable, reliable, and clean energy, upgrading industries and infrastructures, improving equality, and other positive changes. For instance, CO2 Emission Per Value-Added for both scope 1(24) and 2(25) scale sub-linearly with the urban population. This phenomenon suggests a faster decrease rate in the environmental pollutant emissions from larger cities, maybe because cleaner energy sources are being adopted in China's urban regions. Therefore, their urban system is moving towards a more sustainable situation. On the other side, some indicators show negative sustainable impacts with significance (shaded in red), and these indicators have not been discussed in previous literature. For example, Land Used for Living (PC)(33) sub-linearly scales with population (-0.136), and regression for Highly UADs confirms the sublinear tendency (-0.164). Similarly, the Public Restrooms (PC)(43) also scales sub-linearly with population. These findings are also supported by Sugar and Kennedy (2020)  about the densification with city growth (). The negative coefficients indicate a more intensive land use pattern in Chinese relatively urbanized regions. It also suggests that people living in developed urban areas tend to live in smaller spaces, and public facilities, such as public restrooms, are deficient in these populous cities. As more people move into the urban centers, their demand and desire for housing escalate, resulting in a more competitive human-land contradiction. In particular, this phenomenon often exists in those first-tier cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, where residential land supply is in shortage to accommodate the increasing population, and public facility provision is also inadequate. In such a way, the rising inflow of migrants is not treated well when the cities get larger. Cities under different definitions behave similarly concerning the urban scaling pattern  UADs and Highly UADs show the same conclusions in their urban scaling pattern, although slight differences are observed. For example, the Water Stress Index (7) is statistically significant in these two regressions for both UADs and Highly UADs, and their coefficients are 0.928 and 0.834, respectively, representing a super-linear relationship with population. Given that the available freshwater resources are definite, this super-linear trend implies that larger cities usually suffer more severe water scarcity. However, the per capita water stress is lessened for highly UADs by actions such as more efficient water usage, improved water productivity, reduced losses in municipal distribution networks, and more industrial and energy cooling processes. This phenomenon also happens to Water Use Per GDP (4), which sub-linearly scales with population size for both UADs and Highly UADs. The sub linearity could be out of the promotion of tertiary industry amid economic structure restructuring, while the water-intensive primary sector was restrained. Moreover, water-saving technology is encouraged in densely populated areas, and water resources management and innovations are promoted (Tong et al., 2011 ). Fig. 2   is a demonstration of Table 1  by plotting some statistically significant indicators (p  < 0.05) and their corresponding confidence intervals for both UADs and Highly UADs and their indications concerning SDG goals. The colors represent the tendency towards sustainability (green) and against sustainability (red). 3.2.1 Robustness of the results The distribution pattern of residuals versus fitted values of both UADs and Highly UADs confirms the existence of heteroskedasticity (Supplementary Figure 1 in SI). Heterosckedaticisty was adjusted by running a Breusch-Pagan test, using robust standard errors. Therefore, to evaluate the sensitivity of our results, we tested the robustness by running four regressions of these indicators in two types: a) UADs and Highly UADs; b) with and without the heteroscedasticity. The reasons why we distinguish UADs and Highly UADs are discussed in the introduction section. The p-het value after correction of heteroskedasticity should be theoretically more accurate, which has rarely been taken into account in previous studies (Qu and Xu, 2021 ). Therefore, indicators whose p-value and p-het are both lower than 0.05 are treated as more robust and reliable. For example, the scaling relation of Recycled Water Production Capacity (PC) (6) is significant for UADs without considering the heteroscedasticity (p  = 0.03) but is not after the correction of heteroscedasticity (p  = 0.08). In this case, we are not sufficiently confident to conclude that the per capita recycled water production capacity of Chinese prefectural cities is against sustainable development with population. Thus, we are still concerned that the rapidly increasing urban population has posited a higher wastewater treatment demand while studies found China's urbanization has evolved from emphasizing quantity to improvements in both quality and quantity (Guan et al., 2018 ).   3.3 Remaining effect of urban population after urban density and per capita GDP are controlled Alternative explanations are provided in measuring sustainable development progress in Chinese cities  We decomposed the potential influencing factors into built-up areas per capita (population density effect), GDP per capita, along with the population effect. We assume the decoupled population effects from GDP per capita and population density can better explain the contribution of unexpected driving factors to urban indicators based on scaling theory. Table 2  is the regression results of urban indicators of SDGs 6–13 with these three factors in Highly UADs of China. 42 out of 49 indicators are statistically significant with either population density effect, GDP per capita effect, or population effect with a p-value lower than or equal to 0.05. In particular, 19 out of the 42 urban indicators are statistically significant (p <=0.05) with the population. Among them, about 68.4% (13) have two statistically significant elasticities, and 31.8% (6) have all three statistically significant elasticities. The results keep consistent with Table 1  that the majority of the urban indicators demonstrate scaling patterns, and one or more factors in population density effect, population effect, and GDP per capita effect can explain those changing urban attributes. Moreover, we may have unobserved factors contributing to their scaling patterns concerning those 19 indicators with significance in population. Notably, SDG 7 (Affordable & Clean Energy) & 13 (Climate Actions) have no significant indicators with population-related scaling effects. The potential reasons vary, which could be due to insufficient indicators under the goal, especially for SDG 13, or because the population itself can hardly affect these urban indicators. For example, Electricity Consumption Per GDP (Indicator 12) becomes only significant to the scaling of GDP, indicating that the vibrant economic activities rather than the increasing population living in larger cities help improve energy consumption efficiency. Among the indicators driven by population with significance, they behave differently towards sustainability. Most indicators in SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), and 12 (Responsible Consumption & Production) lean towards sustainability. We assume the population, excluding built-up areas and GDP per capita, plays a significant role in pulling these goals towards sustainability. However, the population has mixed effects on SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities & Communities). Goal 11 contains multiple significant indicators with unsustainable performance, as shown in Table 1 , such as public restrooms provision. Particularly, the scaling coefficient of Indicator 43 Public Restrooms (PC) was -0.223. However, when we decompose the potential driving forces, it is the built-up area that plays the primary role in explaining the number of restrooms per capita, as shown in Table 2 . The result provides alternative explanations to the previous sub-linear scaling relation between the provided restrooms and population; that is, more intense built-up areas of larger cities tend to significantly contribute to more restrooms provision rather than the urban population. This observation suggests that dense and compact urban forms can help promote the sustainability visions of cities, which should be appreciated in future urban planning. In addition, SDG 6 (Clean Water & Sanitation) and 8 (Decent Work & Economic Growth) are against sustainability with significance. After the built-up areas and GDP are controlled for, the urban population still has a significant effect on indicators such as the Water Stress Index, implying that factors other than GDP and built-up areas may increase the water stress. Reasons could be citizens’ perceptions of the value attached to water. These indicators deserve more attention from policymakers for improving sustainable development at the city level. Population effect, regardless of per capita GDP and population density, is still the major contributor to urban SDG metrics  Fig. 3   plots those urban indicators with significance by revealing the contribution (in percentage) of the three explanatory components. We observed that the population scaling factor (gray box) spares the highest contribution to the most urban indicators than the per capita GDP and population density effect. For example, the population density effect can explain 64% of the Sidewalk Area (PC) while per capita GDP contributes -55%. The remaining impact of population size, independent of the former two factors, contributes to 91% of the sidewalk area (PC). The remaining effect of population implies the complexity of cities that other unexpected urban attributes embodied in population, except for per capita GDP and built-up areas, can essentially influence the SDG metrics.   4 Conclusions and discussions Understanding how various urban attributes scale with the urban population is critical for instructing future sustainable development, especially considering the SDG indicators in realms such as the urban energy and water systems, infrastructures, and society. This paper assessed the sustainable development progress of China's prefectural cities and tried to inform better practical solutions. We found the SDG indicators of cities can be well explained by urban scaling theory, and the SDGs framework is robust and statistically validated to evaluate the city-level sustainable progress in China. However, by analyzing 49 indicators of SDGs 6–13, which is relatively a small portion compared with the full SDGs framework consisting of 231 indicators, we found problems such as data deficiency. The data limitation may lie in the current voluntary data reporting schemes in measuring their SDG goals progress (Messerli et al., 2019 ). Our study implies a necessity to mandatorily collect data at both the city and country levels to monitor the comprehensive progress of sustainable development, especially in countries such as China. In particular, we found data is needed for inequality elimination and climate action for Chinese prefectural cities. Moreover, many SDG indicators’ urban scaling patterns are detected in Chinese prefectural cities. Basically, the urban agglomeration effects of China conform to the urban scaling theory, i.e., the super linearity of socioeconomic outputs and sub linearity of infrastructure with urban population size. Chinese cities perform well in terms of economies of scale, pollution reduction, public service provision, etc. However, some urban indicators are against sustainability trends, such as water stress, water resource scarcity, land used for living, etc. Moreover, alternative explanations are provided when we singled out the population effects; that is, some urban metrics such as public restrooms rely more on intense built-up morphology or economic development in larger cities other than the urban population. Last but not least, we found that population, which substantially interweaves with other urban attributes, is the major contributor to explaining Chinese sustainable development indicators, regardless of per capita GDP and built-up areas per capita. In one way, it explains the complexity of cities, that however cities operate, their interdependencies are beyond our expectations and can't be well-explained by any specific scaling patterns or theories simply. On the other hand, it substantiates the urban scaling theory that city size measured by population can be a crucial characteristic of a city, whereas its distinguished culture, history, geography, and urban landscape, especially in steeringthe sustainable development.  5 Policy implications and future steps The above conclusions can bring about policy recommendations. Firstly, concerning urban attributes that are significantly changed with the population size, i.e., land used for living and public restrooms, urban planning strategies can be differentiated and coordinated by taking the variegated scaling effects into consideration, rather than expecting a one-size-fits-all solution. For example, people in larger and more urbanized cities are suffering from more severe shortages in terms of living space and restrooms, as reflected by the large negative values in scaling coefficients. Their pathway towards sustainable development calls for a more optimized distribution of urban resources, notably the public infrastructures and environmental hygiene facilities, in response to the country's commitments by moving towards more people-orientied urban societies. Therefore, a science-based city development evaluation standard should be incorporated regarding cities of different sizes, not simply based on the conventional per capita values (Chen, 2013 ). Secondly, urban residents in urban, peri‑urban, and rural areas have distinct preferences for their living. Infrastructure construction, restrooms provision in public space, or taxi station arrangement may have a prolonged impact on sustainable development at the city level. In this sense, these facilities should proceed in a well-planned, integrated, and inclusive manner. More importantly, city governments should work together with other stakeholders such as civil society organizations, academia, as well as the central government in drafting effective and tailored policies and keeping updated on the most cutting-edge technologies and knowledge. For example, concerning China's ever-evolving urbanization course, people-centered urbanization has usually been criticized for lagging behind land-centered urbanization. Our regression analysis signifies that extensive land use patterns and land expansion tendencies still prevail in the urban fringes; that is, people residing in the urban centers of Chinese cities have limited living and recreational spaces. This phenomenon impedes large cities’ pace towards sustainability. Therefore, we highly recommend rationalizing land use and restraining the disordered urban sprawling through collective actions among key stakeholders for integrated policies to balance the pace between people-centered and land-centered urbanization. In terms of future steps, this paper admittedly confronted certain limitations, and efforts can be spent on polishing them. Firstly, the quality, availability, and reliability of data may bring certain biases or distortions to conclusions. For example, as shown in Table 1 , the Secondary Industry GDP (PC)(22) scales superlinearly (0.19) with the urban population for UADs (p <0.001), while the scaling coefficient of the population is reversed into sub-linear(-0.206) in Table 2  when we decompose it from the effects of economic activities and built-up areas, and GDP per capita displays a strong super-linear effect (1.247). The potential reason could be the deficiency and inaccuracy in data collection processes. Therefore, one future step to expand the policy implications lie in more comprehensive and accurate datasets. This paper adopted the authoritative resources from China's statistical book for the most recent year, 2015, to provide benchmarking results, given that many urban attributes of SDGs at the city level can be well disclosed by the statistical yearbook with a clear and unified administrative boundary for comparison. We also notice that there are still other data sources related to Chinese sustainable development, especially on fine scales. For example, researchers have demonstrated ways to provide spatial and temporal analysis concerning urban development complemented with more accurate geospatial data through remote sensing techniques and big data diving at various scales (Bettencourt, 2008 ; Jiang et al., 2022 ; Xu et al., 2020) . We expect to apply similar methods in the future to reflect a more dynamic and refined perspective in evaluating Chinese cities' sustainable development progress. Secondly, the interactions, synergies, or trade-offs between the different SDGs, remain to be further evaluated. For example, a recent paper by Zhang et al. (2019)  has connected the water infrastructure planning to the socioeconomic performance to predict the GHG emissions from the water sector under different urbanization scenarios, i.e., compact urban design, improved energy technology, and restricted migration in big cities. In this way, it provides insights concerning the interactions between SDG 6 (Clean Water & Sanitation), 11 (Sustainable Cities & Communities), and 13 (Climate Action) in consideration of the scaling patterns of cities. Our paper treats SDGs independently and evaluates their scaling patterns, and we expect to conduct future research in considering the scaling patterns of the interactions among SDGs. Lastly, a systematic way of thinking in consideration of the complexity of urban ecosystems can be adopted in the future. We found some inconsistencies in the statistical significance of scaling relations between UADs and Highly UADs. Some indicators show significant results in all UADs regression while demonstrating insignificant in Highly UADs regression, such as Secondary Industry GDP(PC) (22). The potential explanation could be the non-linear effect that the Secondary Industry GDP can be affected by the population at the initial stage of urbanization, while it would not be significantly altered after the urbanization level reaches a saturation point. Laborers have been pulled out from the primary industry and absorbed by the secondary and tertiary sectors through economic restructuring in those more developed Chinese urban centers. This phenomenon reflects the complexity of urban systems, whose changes with population may not be linear. Moreover, the fuzzy boundary of cities urges the necessity to consider the complexity of urban cities in the future. Since the city is not a closed system, its boundary is fluid. Their usages of natural resources such as groundwater, agriculture products, and natural gasses lie in the external supply of these resources. In particular, these city-level SDG indicators with scaling effects are highly relevant to their meta-coupled systems, that their consumption in the cities relies on the resource supply of their peri‑areas and distant places, and pollution of the cities needs their meta-coupled systems to digest and alleviate (Liu, 2017 ). Therefore, the fuzzy boundaries bring about more intricate interactions beyond their own complexity. In respect to these phenomena, a fine-scale methodology should be adopted to understand the mechanism of these interactions by tracking how individuals travel across cities, such as from small to bigger ones, and how they experience the urban attributes’ variation. Moreover, a systematic way of thinking should be addressed by linking cities with their meta-coupled human-nature systems, rather than isolating the city itself for analysis. For example, Chung et al. (2021)  linked cities’ water usages with their coupled watersheds and found the interrelationships between built and natural infrastructure in 2113 watersheds for 317 cities worldwide. Sugar and Kenndy (2020)  also viewed the city as a dissipative structure, which exchanges energy and mass with the surrounding environment. Such ways of analysis could be applied in the future to construct a more comprehensive understanding of Chinese cities' SDG progress and help bring better policy implications for decision-makers.
