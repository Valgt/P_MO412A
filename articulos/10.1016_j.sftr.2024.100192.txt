                  The United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted in 2015, are a universal call to action to eliminate poverty, protect the environment, and foster global peace and prosperity by 2030. This paper conducts a crucial bibliometric analysis of research publications related to the SDGs from 2015 to 2022, aiming to assess current knowledge, identify trends, and address research gaps. Using a dataset of 2227 research publications from the Web of Science database, the study reveals a significant increase in research focusing on the SDGs, reflecting growing awareness of global challenges. Moreover, there is a noticeable trend in interdisciplinary research, highlighting the need for collaborative solutions across diverse fields. Encouragingly, developing countries demonstrate a growing interest in the SDGs, indicating a collective global commitment to sustainable development and addressing issues affecting vulnerable populations. The implications of this research are extensive, providing valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders to better understand the current state of SDG knowledge and prioritize future research efforts and resource allocation effectively, ultimately working towards achieving the SDGs by 2030.

The United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted in 2015, are a universal call to action to eliminate poverty, protect the environment, and foster global peace and prosperity by 2030. This paper conducts a crucial bibliometric analysis of research publications related to the SDGs from 2015 to 2022, aiming to assess current knowledge, identify trends, and address research gaps. Using a dataset of 2227 research publications from the Web of Science database, the study reveals a significant increase in research focusing on the SDGs, reflecting growing awareness of global challenges. Moreover, there is a noticeable trend in interdisciplinary research, highlighting the need for collaborative solutions across diverse fields. Encouragingly, developing countries demonstrate a growing interest in the SDGs, indicating a collective global commitment to sustainable development and addressing issues affecting vulnerable populations. The implications of this research are extensive, providing valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders to better understand the current state of SDG knowledge and prioritize future research efforts and resource allocation effectively, ultimately working towards achieving the SDGs by 2030.

Introduction The world faces numerous challenges, including extreme poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, and social injustice. To overcome these challenges and create a sustainable and equitable future, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, social and ensure that all people can enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030. The SDGs outline 17 interlinked goals with 169 targets (see Table 1  ), and it is recognized that action in one area will affect outcomes in others (United Nations [1 ]). In September 2015, all 193 United Nations Member States officially adopted these goals in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) as a part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The SDGs build upon the success of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were adopted in 2000 and had a deadline of 2015, and aim to address MDGs shortcomings by encompassing a broader, more integrated, and interconnected set of objectives. The MDGs were successful in some areas, such as reducing the number of people living in extreme poverty and increasing access to primary education, but they also faced challenges and limitations. One of the key differences between the MDGs and the SDGs is that the MDGs focused mainly on developing countries and addressed several development issues [2 ]. Conversely, the SDGs apply to all countries and address interlinked economic, social, and environmental challenges. The SDGs are designed to be universal, inclusive, and transformative, aiming to reach all people, leave no one behind, and address the root causes of poverty and inequality [3 ]. The first goal of the SDGs is to end poverty in all its forms and dimensions. This goal is paramount, as over 700 million people live in extreme poverty. Building on the poverty eradication goal, the SDGs emphasize addressing inequalities within and among countries, which includes reducing income disparities, improving access to quality education, healthcare, and clean water, and promoting social inclusion for all individuals regardless of their socio-economic status [4–6 ]. The SDGs also recognize the importance of changing unsustainable consumption and production patterns and addressing global environmental challenges [7 ]. Another critical aspect of the SDGs is their emphasis on environmental sustainability, such as climate change, deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and pollution, which pose significant threats to the planet and humanity. To combat these challenges, the SDGs include goals related to climate action [8 ], affordable and clean energy (SDG-7) [9 ], responsible consumption and production (SDG-12) [10 ], and the protection of life on land (SDG-15) and life below water (SDG-14) [11 ,12 ]. Also, SDGs underscore the importance of education (SDG-4) and awareness in empowering individuals to contribute to sustainable development [13 ]. The SDGs also recognize the importance of data and evidence in shaping policy and practice and call for strengthening national statistical systems to support the monitoring and evaluating of progress toward the goals [14 ]. The UN has established a set of measurable targets and indicators to monitor each SDG's progress, and these indicators capture each goal's essence and provide a basis for tracking progress over time (see Table 1 ). The goals recognize that no single organization or country can tackle these global challenges alone. However, the SDGs call for a new, enhanced global partnership for sustainable development based on mutual accountability and cooperation. In recent years, the SDGs have received widespread support from governments, civil society, the private sector, and individuals [15 ]. Still, there are challenges to implementing the SDGs, such as limited resources, lack of political will, weak institutions, conflict and insecurity, and inadequate data and monitoring systems [16 ]. Regular reviews and assessments help identify gaps, challenges, and successful strategies, enabling governments and stakeholders to make informed decisions and adjustments [17 ]. As a result of the intricate interrelationships involved, it holds great significance for researchers to evaluate the current state of SDGs research. This evaluation can map existing knowledge or generate new insights, which can play a vital role in advancing the United Nations’ defined goals. Moreover, such efforts pave the way for surpassing past limited approaches to sustainable development. In recent years, the investigation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has witnessed a steady surge in research endeavors following its approval in 2015. The growing body of knowledge concerning SDGs offers researchers a valuable opportunity to delve into this research domain from diverse perspectives, drawing insights from previous publications. According to the Sustainable Development Solution Network (2023), the period from the onset of the pandemic until now has experienced setbacks, highlighting the urgency of rethinking our approaches by pinpointing emerging research areas and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration to the development of more resilient and adaptable solutions for achieving the SDGs in a post-pandemic world. While it does not directly propose specific alternatives or rethink the goals, it provides valuable insights to inform decision-making and policy formulation, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable and equitable future. Further, this exploration is crucial in unveiling the domain's structure, gaining a deeper comprehension of the current state, identifying future trends in SDG-related topics, and enabling researchers to concentrate their efforts more efficiently. Several studies have evaluated SDGs literature by scrutinizing earlier works. Recently, scholars have been diversifying their approach to studying SDGs research. In addition to traditional qualitative reviews, they have begun incorporating quantitative methods like bibliometric analysis and meta-analysis. Notable latest studies conducted by Yamaguchi et al. [18 ] and Mishra et al. [19 ] focused on bibliometric analysis of the literature published on SDGs from 2015 to 2022, sourced from the Web of Science core collection to evaluate the growth and consolidation of scientific research in this domain. The findings revealed a rapid expansion of the SDGs field, with a noticeable trend toward exploring a broader range of research areas. Similar bibliometric studies focused on SDGs by different researchers [20–24 ]. Similarly, many bibliometric studies are being published on SDGs mainly related to the education, health, business and entrepreneurship sector, and poverty [25–30 ]. Nevertheless, limited bibliometric research has been conducted on the overall concepts of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their development. We are convinced that there is still a requirement for multidisciplinary bibliometric research on the literature about the SDGs. Such research would enable scholars to gather more comprehensive, diverse, and detailed insights into this field. This paper comprehensively explores the SDGs research domain to supplement previous bibliometric studies. This study aims to comprehensively analyze research efforts in the field of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) trends and prospects by the global community from 2015 to 2022, shedding light on the evolution and maturity of scientific research in this domain. Unlike previous bibliometric studies on SDGs, which did not cover the year 2022 entirely, this research addresses this limitation. Employing a novel bibliometric technique, the study aims to identify emerging and declining SDGs structure research areas from static and dynamic perspectives. Driven by the urgency of achieving the United Nations’ ambitious Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, this present study embarks on a systematic bibliometric review of the global research landscape of SDGs to uncover the trends, gaps, and collaborations defining current academic efforts tackling the world's most pressing challenges. By analyzing patterns in publication quantity, authorship networks, and prominent research areas, we seek to provide a clear picture of the scientific community's engagement with the SDGs. Ultimately, this review aspires to inform future research strategies, optimize resource allocation, and guide collaborative efforts toward realizing the transformative vision of Agenda 2030. The investigation encompasses various aspects, including publication growth, identifying top-cited articles, examining international research collaborations, determining leading journals, prolific authors, and institutions, and analyzing hot topics and themes related to SDGs. By doing so, the study seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state of research on Sustainable Development Goals. The study is guided by the following research questions (RQ), which will be answered in the subsequent sections:RQ1 What is the trend in publication growth for SDGs research?  RQ2 What are the most highly cited publications in the field of SDGs research?  RQ3 Who are the SDGs top research publications’ institutions, countries, and authors?  RQ4 What are the international collaborations in SDGs research publications?  RQ5 What are SDGs research publications’ most prolific research subject areas and funders?  RQ6 What are the authors’ typical keywords, trends, and themes in SDGs research publications?     Methods Data collection and data filtration This descriptive study analyzes global research publications on sustainable development goals (SDGs) using bibliometric analysis techniques. The data used in this study was collected from the Clarivate Analytics Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection database, a widely recognized and respected source of scientific information. The database was searched using a specific search algorithm, which involved using Boolean logical search operators to find document titles related to SDGs, i.e., “TITLE = (“Sustainable Development Goals” OR “SDGs” OR “2030 Agenda for Sustainable”).” The search was limited to the period between 2015 and 2022. Certain types of documents, such as meeting abstracts, editorial materials, news items, corrections, letters, book chapters, book reviews, reprints, retractions, and discussions, were excluded. The initial result consisted of 2274 documents, but 47 were found irrelevant after the screening and removed from the analysis (Fig. 1  ). To ensure the accuracy and consistency of the data, the search was conducted on January 05th, 2023, as the WoS database is updated daily. In total, 2227 publications were found to meet the criteria for this study. The data was exported in plain text format (.txt) and then converted into a comma-separated values (.csv) file format for analysis. In this study, three major types of documents were categorized, including articles (1874; 84.15 %), reviews (218; 9.79 %), article-early access (106; 4.76 %), article-proceeding papers (19; 0.85 %), and review-early access (10; 0.45 %). This categorization provides a comprehensive view of the research in this field, enabling a detailed analysis of the various aspects of SDGs research. This study is significant as it provides valuable insights into SDG research and helps identify areas that require further exploration and investigation.  Analysis tool The study of the 2227 retrieved data involved a thorough analysis using various statistical tools and software. To extract the data, bibliometrix R-package Biblioshiny (version 4.1.3) [31 ] and for data cleaning, filtration, and statistical analysis, Microsoft Excel 2019 (version 16.0.14026.20276) were utilized. For mapping and data visualization, VOSviewer (version 1.6.18) was used [32 ]. Moreover, BibExcel (version 2017) [33 ] was employed for further citation analysis. These bibliometric tools are open-source software, user-friendly, accessible, and cost-effective, widely used worldwide for academic and research purposes. Using these tools in this study allowed for in-depth data analysis. It provided insightful results that were easy to understand and interpret.   Results Main information Table 2   provides an overview of the key descriptive information for the study, encompassing the period from 2015 to 2022. The data includes details on the sources, authors, and citations. The study examined 2227 documents published in 624 journals from the Web of Science database. These documents covered research on sustainable development goals and involved 9691 authors using 3361 keywords (“ID”) and 5623 author-specific keywords. The study revealed an impressive annual growth rate of 69.31 %. On average, each document received 21.28 citations, and there were 5.47 co-authors per document, with approximately 44.23 % of these co-authors being international collaborators.  Publications growth and citation trends In 2015, the UNGA laid the foundation for an ambitious transformation of our world by adopting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This visionary initiative seeks to forge a sustainable society where economic prosperity coexists harmoniously with the fulfillment of social and environmental imperatives. Designed to be achieved by 2030, these SDGs are encapsulated within the UNGA Resolution known as the 2030 Agenda or simply Agenda 2030. Since their inception, the SDGs have garnered significant attention from the academic community and experts alike. Scholars and specialists have delved into the details of sustainable development, scrutinized the implementation of SDGs at national, regional, and global levels, and contemplated the role of informality in these endeavors. Their invaluable insights have materialized through numerous scholarly papers, comprehensive reports, and many publications, collectively contributing to the global discourse on sustainable development. Table 3   provides the year-wise growth rate of publications between 2015 and 2022 and their citation metrics, such as citation counts, average citations per publication, h-index, and h-core concerning SDGs. During this period, a total of 2227 research publications were made, depicting a significant increase in the number of publications over time and cited 47,400 times in total. With an annual growth rate of 69.31 %, the number of published research papers increased from 17 in 2015 to 678 in 2022, reflecting an increased interest and progressively more attention has been paid to SDGs. The year 2022 published the highest number of research papers, with a total of 678, followed by 2021 (TP = 518) and 2020 (TP = 399). The annual distribution of citation count has shown a slight fluctuation trend. On the other hand, 2018 received the maximum citation with a TC of 10,124, and 2016 got the highest average citations per publication, i.e., a C/P of 101.37. The year 2019 got the maximum h-index (h-index = 51), and 2018 had the highest h-core of 7670, signifying the importance and impact of research on sustainable development goals. The relationship between the number of publications and citation trends is presented in Fig. 2  , which shows a steady increase in the number of publications, with an R2  value of approximately 1. However, the value of R2  in the case of total citation is inconsistent. Notably, the most recently published papers tend to have lower citation scores, as it takes at least two years to gather substantial data for meaningful analysis.  Highly cited papers Analyzing highly cited papers offers a valuable opportunity to grasp the present state of knowledge in a specific field [34 ]. Table 4   offers an in-depth analysis of the top 10 most cited research papers on sustainable development goals published between 2015 and 2021. The table presents a comprehensive picture of the extent to which the research community has recognized and cited these articles. The data in the table reveals that four of the top 10 most cited papers have received an impressive number of citations per year, with more than 500 citations. This indicates the significant impact and contribution of these articles to the field of sustainable development goals. The total citations (TC) range for the top 10 papers is quite broad, with the lowest being 351 and the highest 1616. The article with the highest total citation among the top 10 is “Global, regional, and national causes of under-5 mortality in 2000–15: an updated systematic analysis with implications for the Sustainable Development Goals ”, authored by Liu et al. [35 ] with a total citation of 1616. This is followed by “High-quality health systems in the Sustainable Development Goals era: time for a revolution ” by Kruk et al. [36 ] with a total citation of 957 and “The significance of soils and soil science towards realisation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals ” by Keesstra et al. [37 ] with a total citation of 761. The table also presents the normalized total citation (NTC) for the top 10 articles. The NTC ranges between 6.48 and 15.94, reflecting the relative citation impact of the articles compared to others published in the same year. This highlights the wide recognition and impact of the top 10 SDG research papers. Notably, 9 of the top 10 most cited papers are articles, and 1 is a review paper, emphasizing the significance of article papers in sustainable development goals research as they thoroughly analyze current research and can steer future studies. Overall, the data presented in the table provides valuable insight into the most highly cited research papers on sustainable development goals, providing a clear picture of how these articles have contributed to advancing knowledge in this field.  Prolific journal Table 5   presents the top 20 journals that have published the most articles in the field of SDGs between 2015 and 2022 is noteworthy. The results indicate that the Journal “Sustainability” holds the top position for publishing the most significant number of articles on SDGs, with a total of 403 articles and receiving the maximum number of citations, which amounts to 4727. Following closely behind is the “Journal of Cleaner Production” (TP = 85; TC = 3149) and “Sustainable Development” (TP = 64; TC = 2152). Similar findings were achieved when reviewing SDGs’ progress, challenges, and opportunities using bibliometric methodologies [19 ]. When considering the average citations per publication (C/P), “Environmental Research Letters” emerges as the clear leader with an impressive average of 82.3 citations per paper. The “Economic Research-Ekonomska Istrazivanja” and the “Journal of Cleaner Production” journals follow suit with 62.9 and 37.05 average citations per paper, respectively. Regarding impact factor, “Nature Sustainability” boasts the highest impact factor (IF) of 27.157, followed by “Journal of Cleaner Production” (11.072), “Business Strategy and the Environment” (10.801), and “Science of the Total Environment” (10.753). Concerning the h-index, the “Sustainability” (32) and “Journal of Cleaner Production” (31) are the most remarkable. This finding contrasts with the results reported in earlier bibliometric studies [18,26 ]. Five of the 20 journals in the table are from the publisher Elsevier, while three are from MDPI and Springer. The leading journal, “Sustainability,” comes from the publisher MDPI, showcasing these publishers’ significant presence in the SDGs field. These findings emphasize the importance of these journals and publishers in promoting research and discussions on sustainable development goals and the efforts made toward achieving a sustainable future. Of the top 20 journals, fourteen are in the first quartile (Q1), five are in the second quartile (Q2), and only one is in the fourth quartile (Q3). These results indicate that most of the top journals in bioremediation research are high-quality and influential, significantly impacting the scientific community. Authors’ research interests can be inferred from the scopes of the widely recognized journals they publish in.  Most prolific author Table 6   showcases the top 10 most productive authors who have published research on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) between 2015 and 2022. These authors have made substantial contributions to the field, as they have produced many research papers, with a range of publications ranging from 8 to 16. The author Walter Leal Filho of Hamburg University of Applied Sciences in Germany stands out as the most productive among the top 10 authors, with a total publication count of 16, and has been active in the research area of SDGs since 2018. He is followed closely by Cameron Allen of Monash University in Australia, Bojie Fu, and Rodrigo Lozano, with 11, 9, and 9 publications, respectively. In addition to the number of publications, the analysis also indicates the number of citations received by the authors. Cameron Allen of Monash University received the maximum number of citations, with 997 citations, Johan Bouma with 977 citations, Walter Leal Filho with 882, and Rodrigo Lozano with 703 citations. Table 6  highlights the average citations per publication for each of the top 10 prolific authors. Johan Bouma holds the highest average citations per publication, scoring 122.13. This indicates that his research has significantly impacted the field and has been widely recognized by the research community. The data presented in the tables reveal that authors from European institutions play a crucial role in the research publication, have made significant contributions to SDGs, and received significant citations for their work, indicating their research's impact. In conclusion, these authors are a testament to the importance of research in advancing our understanding in this field. Fig. 3   presents an overview of the top 10 most productive authors in the last eight years. The size of each circle in the graph corresponds to the number of articles published by the respective author in a given year. The darkness of each circle indicates the number of citations received per year, reflecting the impact of their work. Productivity was assessed based on the total number of articles published by each author during the specified period. On the other hand, the impact of their research was evaluated by considering the annual citation count. In particular, Walter Leal Filho emerges as the most productive author in this analysis. Furthermore, Rodrigo Lozano and Ye Liu are seminal authors on the subject, consistently producing publications from 2015 to 2022. It is essential to acknowledge that while productivity is one aspect of researchers’ output, it does not fully represent the overall quality of their work. Scholars have commonly relied on other indicators beyond the total citation count to assess the significance and relevance of researchers’ contributions to the scientific community.  Prolific institutions and their collaboration The SDGs research publications have been a focus of attention for many institutions worldwide from 2015 to 2022. During this period, 1274 institutions participated in 2227 publications related to SDGs. The research carried out by these institutions aimed to support the implementation of the United Nations’ SDGs and contribute to global sustainability. The efforts put in by these institutions have helped to improve our understanding of the challenges and opportunities that come with achieving the SDGs. Table 7   lists the top 10 most productive institutions in terms of publication. The Chinese Academy of Sciences topped the list with 23 publications, followed by Utrecht University with 19 and the University of Queensland with 15. The top institutions came from nine countries: the UK, China, Australia, Spain, and the Netherlands. Regarding total citations, the University College London received the most with 783, followed by the University of Sussex (TC = 772) and Utrecht University (TC = 603). These institutions have been highly recognized for their contributions to SDG research and have set the benchmark for others. The significant number of publications and citations these institutions receive highlights the importance of SDGs research and its impact on the global community. To gain deeper insights into institutional cooperation, we constructed a cooperation network map comprising 465 institutions that met the minimum criterion of 6 shared documents (Fig. 4  ). This visualization represents the collaborative connections established among these institutions. Each node in the graph corresponds to a unique institution, while the thickness of the connecting lines conveys the level of collaboration and the number of partnerships formed between them. Notably, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in China, the University of Oxford (USA), the University of Queensland, the University of Melbourne, the World Health Organization (WHO), the University of Cambridge, and the University of Utrecht emerged as central hubs within this cooperation network. The weight of a link, represented by the line thickness, signifies the quantity of co-authored papers produced by researchers from the involved institutions. Hence, the thicker the line, the stronger the collaborative bond between the institutions.  Prolific country The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have garnered global interest, with researchers from 150 countries actively contributing to their advancement. Table 8   showcases the top 20 countries based on their total publications (TP) to determine the leading nations in SDGs research. Topping the list is the USA, with an impressive TP of 1136, TC (total citations) of 119,253, and an h-index of 221. This indicates a substantial focus on SDGs research by American scholars. The United Kingdom follows closely with TP = 857, TC = 65,200, and an h-index of 179, demonstrating a significant commitment to the field. China (TP = 610, TC = 23,144 & h-index = 74), Australia (TP = 579, TC = 50,337 & h-index = 175), Spain (TP = 478, TC = 15,217 & h-index = 61), Germany (TP = 396, TC = 23,057 & h-index = 92), and India (TP = 386, TC = 38,261 & h-index = 152) also feature prominently among the leading countries in SDGs research. The high publication output of these countries can be attributed to their strong economic power and substantial investment in research, development, and innovation. Notably, 16 of the top productive countries belong to the significant industrialized G20 nations (Yang et al., 2012), with the majority from European Union countries (09) followed by Asian countries (04). The extensive SDG research is facilitated by robust collaboration among institutions within and across national boundaries. This collaboration is made possible by advanced scientific capabilities, thriving economies, financial strength, technological advancements, and sufficient research funding in these countries. Remarkably, Ethiopia stands out for having the highest average citation per paper (C/P) among the top 20 countries, with a value of 204.31. These findings underscore these countries’ significant contributions and active engagement in pursuing SDGs research. Engaging in collaborative efforts between countries or research institutions in academic activities plays a pivotal role in promoting the dissemination of knowledge and fostering academic exchange among experts [38 ]. Such collaborations, whether within a single nation or across international borders, can profoundly impact research endeavors’ prominence, visibility, and citation impact [39 ,40 ]. Fig. 5   visually represents the world map, illustrating the collaborative relationships between countries in SDG research publications. Collaborative networks are indicated by straight lines connecting two or more countries. Notably, the United Kingdom and the USA emerged as leading countries in the number of publications, collaborating with 11 and 9 countries, respectively. These two nations are also highly active in global collaborations with other countries concerning SDGs research publications. The most prominent collaboration occurs between researchers from the USA and the United Kingdom, with a remarkable frequency of 103 publications. Other significant collaborations include USA-Australia (64), United Kingdom-Australia (55), USA-Germany (55), United Kingdom-Germany (54), and USA-Canada (47). These collaborations predominantly involve developed and developing countries, all working towards achieving the 17 SDGs. The findings help identify potential research partners to advance knowledge in SDGs. By leveraging these findings, stakeholders can promote further cooperative efforts and contribute to the collective pursuit of sustainable development goals.  Subject orientation of SDGs research Table 9   thoroughly analyses the top 10 subject areas contributing to Sustainable Development Goals based on the number of publications. The research analyzed 106 subject areas and found that Environmental Sciences & Ecology had the most publications, with 1101 articles. Science & Technology - Other Topics followed with 866 articles; Business & Economics came in third with 244 articles. The subject area of Environmental Sciences & Ecology also recorded the highest number of citations, with a total of 23,573. Science & Technology - Other Topics followed closely with 18,808 citations. However, considering the average citations per publication, Energy & Fuels took the lead with 32.81 citations per publication, Public Administration with 25.28 citations per publication, and Engineering with 25.25 citations per publication. The research provides a comprehensive overview of the subject areas contributing to Sustainable Development Goals and highlights their impact regarding the number of publications and citations. The results show that Environmental Sciences & Ecology and Science & Technology - Other Topics have significantly contributed to this field's research. Additionally, the average citations per publication indicate each subject area's impact in terms of its influence and significance. The findings of this research will be helpful for researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders to understand the key subject areas contributing to Sustainable Development Goals and their impact.  Thematic map and evolution Thematic maps play a crucial role in scientific mapping, aiding researchers in visualizing and comprehending the conceptual framework of a specific research domain. These maps are classified into four theme typologies, each determined by their quadrant placement [41 ]. The categorization of themes on these maps is based on two fundamental criteria: centrality and density [42 ]. Centrality pertains to the extensive work associated with a specific theme, signifying its prominence within the research field. Conversely, density indicates the importance or significance of a given theme. By carefully considering these two criteria, researchers can gain valuable insights into the underlying conceptual structure of their area of study. Thematic maps thus serve as invaluable tools for researchers, facilitating a deeper understanding and visualization of the intricate relationships within their research domain. In the present study, the authors utilize keywords to identify the underlying conceptual structure of SDGs research, as depicted in Fig. 6  . The themes in the upper-right quadrant (Q1) are denoted as “motor themes.” These themes exhibit both high centrality and density, signifying their remarkable significance and potential for further advancement within the domain of SDGs research. This research field's relevance has recently intensified due to its substantial impact on national economies and the well-being of individuals, communities, and nations. The impacts are evident in the present and are projected to become even more pronounced in the future. The key themes identified in Q1 encompass a diverse range of areas, including food security [43–46 ], ecosystem services [47 ,48 ], poverty [49 ,50 ], agriculture [51 ], biodiversity [52 ], trade-offs [53 ], water [54 ], health, circular economy [55 ,56 ], higher education [57 ], corporate social responsibility [58 ], artificial intelligence [59 ,60 ], citizen science [61 ], sustainability reporting [62 ], and innovation [63 ]. Conversely, in the upper-left quadrant (Q2), referred to as niche themes, we find well-established yet isolated topics, such as monitoring [64 ], health policy [65 ], and global health. These highly specialized themes may not exhibit the same level of centrality and density as those found in Q1. Moving to the lower-left quadrant (Q3), we encounter themes that are characterized as marginal and underdeveloped. These themes include network analysis, millennium development goals, equity, and integration. Their placement in this quadrant indicates their emerging or declining nature, possessing low centrality and density. This suggests that these themes have the potential for significant growth or may gradually fade over time. While they might not currently hold significant influence in the research field, they are worth monitoring as they could become more relevant in the future. Next, we arrive at the lower-right quadrant (Q4), which showcases themes that are both basic and transversal in nature. The themes here exhibit high centrality, meaning they hold substantial influence and prominence within the research field. However, they exhibit low density, suggesting that these themes span various research areas and possess a more fundamental and overarching nature. The themes in Q4 encompass critical topics like sustainable development goals (SDGs), sustainability, the 2030 agenda, climate change, and COVID-19. These themes are foundational in research and provide essential insights across multiple disciplines. From 2015 to 2022, SDGs research's thematic temporal evolution landscape has witnessed noteworthy changes, as depicted in Fig. 7  . In the initial period from 2015 to 2020, the research predominantly revolved around the 17 goals of SDGs, encompassing crucial areas like climate change, food security, health policy, corporate social responsibility, circular economy, business, education for sustainability, tourism, and sustainability indicators. Bangladesh emerged as a central area of interest for SDG researchers throughout this phase. This emphasis on Bangladesh was likely due to its unique challenges and opportunities in achieving sustainable development and its active engagement in addressing various SDG-related issues [66 ]. During 2021, researchers noticed the emergence of new themes and research areas with a specific focus on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as carbon sequestration [67 ,68 ], belt and road initiatives [69] , Iran, non-financial reporting [70 ], motivation, waste management [71 ], and analytic hierarchy process [72 ]. In recent years, a variety of significant themes have emerged in research. These themes encompass agriculture, inequality, indicators, artificial intelligence, corporate social responsibility, sustainable tourism, innovation, and network analysis. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 in late 2019 shifted the primary focus of SDG research towards investigating the pandemic's impact, in line with the 17 goals of SDG [73 ,74 ]. As we moved into 2022, specific topics gained substantial attention. Among these were carbon sequestration and food security, which were strongly emphasized in research areas concerning sustainability, policy, and food security in countries such as India, China, Africa, and Pakistan. Additionally, the spotlight shone on corporate sustainability, renewable energy, industrial ecology, environment, agriculture, and health policy. These themes highlight the ever-evolving research landscape and the need to address pressing global challenges for a more sustainable and equitable future.  Dynamics of authors keywords and trends topics Keywords are crucial in shaping a research study's focus and main themes, facilitating the rapid identification of trends and areas of interest within a specific field [75 ]. This study conducted a co-occurrence analysis on 5623 author keywords from 2227 documents, requiring a minimum of three occurrences per keyword. The resulting map consisted of 579 keywords that met the threshold, forming 10 clusters with a total of 3749 links and a total link strength of 4681. The size of each circle in the map represented the number of occurrences (weights) of the corresponding keyword in the dataset, with larger diameters indicating a higher degree of co-selection (Fig. 8  ). Notably, when examining the keywords of review articles in the co-occurrence map, a large cluster emerged, which, although divided into six main sub-clusters, displayed significant interconnectedness, suggesting a strong relationship among all the keywords. The first cluster (Red) primarily revolved around the thematic core of sustainable development goals (SDGs), specifically SDG 13 (Climate Action), SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), and SDG 1 (No Poverty). The most frequently occurring keywords in this cluster were climate change (57 occurrences), food security (39 occurrences), circular economy (43 occurrences), ecosystem services (28 occurrences), and poverty (26 occurrences). The second cluster (Green) encompassed and reflected the goals of SDG 3 (good health and well-being) and SDG 4 (quality education). The most frequent keywords in this cluster were sustainability (240 occurrences), higher education (41 occurrences), education (36 occurrences), development (24 occurrences), and environment (22 occurrences). The third cluster (Blue) featured keywords such as sustainable development (231 occurrences), 2030 agenda (67 occurrences), COVID-19 (50 occurrences), agenda 2030 (40 occurrences), governance (35 occurrences), network analysis (24 occurrences), citizen science (19 occurrences), and bioeconomy (7 occurrences). This section delves into some prominent trend topics within the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework. Fig. 9   presents a comprehensive analysis of these trends from 2015 to 2022 in the context of SDGs. Notably, the recurring trend topics, like “sustainability,” have been extensively utilized by authors from 2019 to 2022, signifying their enduring relevance. Another topic that gained significant attention, particularly in 2019, is climate change, encompassed by SDG 13. This focus on climate change underscores the growing awareness of its global impact and the urgency for action. Over the years 2018 to 2020, two additional research themes emerged prominently in the scholarly discourse: inequality (linked to SDG 5) and global health (about SDG 3). These topics gained prominence as they represent critical challenges that demand immediate attention for achieving sustainable development. The outbreak of COVID-19 dramatically shifted the focus of research since 2021. The pandemic's unprecedented impact on global health, economies, and social systems became a significant area of concern within the SDGs framework. A noteworthy observation is the surge in emerging research themes and areas of interest that have materialized in recent years. Topics like circular economy, economic growth, and achieving Zero (SDG-Zero Hunger & No Poverty) have attracted increasing attention from the scientific community. This reflects a growing commitment to exploring novel approaches and innovative technologies to ensure effective and sustainable practices aligned with SDG objectives.  Prolific funding agencies Table 10   provides a comprehensive overview of the primary funding agencies that have been instrumental in supporting research related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Notably, the National Natural Science Foundations of China (NFSC) is the most prominent agency in this research field, supporting 78 publications. Following closely are the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) of the UK (with 36 publications) and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) of the UK (with 35 publications). These international organizations have played a crucial role in financing diverse research projects worldwide, significantly contributing to the advancement of the SDGs. Among these leading funding agencies, the research supported by the USA's Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation received the highest number of citations (TC = 4190) across 29 publications. Additionally, it achieved the highest average citations per publication (C/P) of 144.48. These remarkable figures highlight the foundation's substantial impact on research related to the SDGs. The top 10 funding agencies mentioned above have collectively played a critical role in advancing the SDGs by supporting research publications. Their contributions have been pivotal in generating knowledge and enhancing our understanding of SDG challenges. Notably, the World Health Organization (WHO) of Switzerland, with 19 publications, stands out as a leading agency in funding research that addresses the United Nations’ SDGs, underscoring its significant role in this area.   Discussion The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have recently become an essential worldwide plan for dealing with complex social, economic, and environmental problems. As people realize how significant the SDGs are, it is essential to study this topic to understand how well things are going and what challenges are showing up. This present study brings forward a detailed analysis of all the studies done about the SDGs. It helps us see how scholars worldwide look at these important global goals. From 2015 to 2022, there has been a considerable increase in SDG research papers. This growth in research papers shows how urgent it is to find solutions for the many challenging problems the SDGs aim to solve. With only eight years left to complete the 2030 Agenda, researchers are strongly dedicated to using their knowledge and hard work to make these important goals a reality. This study unsurprisingly reveals that SDGs about Food Security (SDG 2), Good Health and Well-being (SDG 3), Climate Action (SDG 13), and Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11) are the ones getting the most attention from researchers. Similar trends were found in both Sweileh [76 ] and Salvia et al. [77 ] using bibliometric methods, with Sweileh emphasizing “good health and well-being” and Salvia et al. identifying high research interest in SDGs 11, 12, 13, and 15, while SDGs 8 and 14 received limited attention. These goals talk about big things, like climate change, ensuring everyone can get good healthcare, planning our cities sustainably, using renewable energy, and eliminating poverty. That is why researchers from all over the world are interested in studying them. Climate change remained a prominent topic, aligning with the overwhelming priority of combating its adverse effects. Healthcare access and equity emerged as crucial subjects, emphasizing the growing awareness of ensuring equal access to healthcare services for all individuals. Sustainable urban planning was another significant theme identified in the analysis. With rapid urbanization becoming a global trend, it is imperative to devise strategies that promote sustainable and eco-friendly urban development. Moreover, the study highlighted renewable energy technologies as a recurrent theme, signifying the increasing emphasis on transitioning to sustainable energy sources to combat climate change. Similar research trends were also highlighted in the study of Marco-Lajara et al. [78 ]. Lastly, poverty eradication was among the prevailing themes in research publications, indicating the enduring and critical focus on addressing economic disparities and promoting inclusive growth [30 ]. These findings underscore the research community's dedication to exploring innovative solutions to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development. These findings highlight the interdisciplinary nature of SDGs research, emphasizing the necessity of collaborative efforts from diverse academic disciplines to address complex sustainability challenges effectively. This research found that most prominent institutions possess the necessary funding to back a wide array of research publications related to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The prevalent discoveries primarily consisted of articles featured in extensively indexed journals. However, the focal point of advanced knowledge appears disproportionately concentrated within certain nations, institutions, and authors, raising a notable concern. The outcomes of the bibliometric assessment reveal a notable concentration of research and advancement concerning the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within developed countries, in contrast to their counterparts in the developing and underdeveloped world [24 ]. The study unveils that countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and Europe, boasting well-established research frameworks and abundant resource accessibility, stand as the foremost prolific contributors to SDG research. This ability has empowered them to formulate invaluable insights and remedies, effectively tackling assorted dimensions of sustainable development. However, the study also highlights a marked surge in research output from developing nations. This ascending trajectory denotes a robust recognition of the significance of SDGs and an acknowledgment of the unique challenges that each region confronts, warranting specialized consideration. As developing nations actively contribute to SDG exploration, it mirrors a promising paradigm shift towards a more all-encompassing worldwide coalition for sustainable development. This inclination underscores the pressing demand for augmented investment and involvement from developing nations in addressing the worldwide quandaries to sustainability that the SDGs present. International collaborations emerged as a prominent feature in SDG research [79 ]. These collaborations between researchers from diverse countries foster knowledge exchange and capacity building. By transcending borders, they enable a more holistic approach to addressing interconnected challenges associated with sustainable development. Such collaborations allow for the amalgamation of expertise, resources, and perspectives, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of SDG-related efforts. Collaboration with researchers from developing nations could enhance the publication of high-impact factor journals and garner financial support for research initiatives on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [80 ]. While the overall research output demonstrates considerable progress, the analysis identifies specific research gaps that demand urgent attention. Notably, technological aspects like renewable energy and sustainable infrastructure have received substantial focus, resulting in a robust understanding of their potential for promoting sustainable development. However, social and behavioral aspects, such as gender equality, poverty eradication, and social justice, warrant greater emphasis. The study highlights the need for a balanced approach that synergizes technological advancements and social equity, as these aspects are deeply interconnected and essential for lasting sustainable development. Implications and future directions This bibliometric analysis offers valuable insights into the advancements and prevailing patterns within Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) research. It demonstrates an escalating global acknowledgment of the vital significance of SDGs and underscores the necessity for collective efforts to tackle urgent challenges. As the world steadily progresses towards achieving the 2030 Agenda, it is imperative for researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders to prioritize research areas exhibiting significant gaps, such as gender equality and poverty eradication, to ensure a comprehensive realization of the SDGs. The examination of bibliometrics reveals the subsequent significant consequences and promising avenues for future exploration:(a) Global Recognition : The increasing focus on SDGs signifies a global consensus on the urgency of addressing sustainability issues. This growing awareness can be leveraged to garner international support and resources for sustainable development initiatives.  (b) Targeted Research Investment : Identifying research gaps, particularly in critical areas like gender equality and poverty eradication, allows for targeted investment in research and innovation, directing efforts toward priority areas and maximizing the impact of resources.  (c) Policy Formulation : Policymakers can utilize the analysis findings to inform evidence-based policy formulation, ensuring that decisions align with the most pressing sustainable development challenges and opportunities.  (d) South-South Collaboration : Encouraging collaboration among researchers in developing countries can foster knowledge exchange, technology transfer, and capacity-building, ultimately strengthening the collective ability to address local and global sustainability challenges [81 ].  (e) North-South Collaboration : Collaborating across national boundaries between developed and developing countries can facilitate the sharing of best practices, resources, and expertise, enabling a more integrated and holistic approach to SDG implementation [82 ].  (f) Monitoring and Evaluation : The bibliometric analysis methodology can serve as a template for ongoing monitoring and evaluation of research trends, enabling researchers and stakeholders to gauge the progress of SDG-related research over time.  (g) Capacity Building : Supporting research efforts in developing countries can lead to improved research infrastructure, enhanced research capabilities, and increased participation of developing nations in global sustainability discourse.      Conclusions This study investigated a bibliometric analysis focusing on the patterns, pathways, and future directions of worldwide Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The analysis used data from the Web of Science core database from 2015 to 2022. Despite the seven years since the initiation of the SDGs, the 2030 agenda continues to exhibit intricate interconnectedness among its goals and excessively ambitious targets. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have gained significant attention in recent years as a global framework for addressing pressing socio-economic and environmental challenges. From 2015 to 2022, the number of publications exponentially increased, reflecting the growing interest and attention given to the SDGs by the academic community. However, the goals themselves were not prominently emphasized cohesively. The results revealed that prevalent themes encompassed climate change, equitable healthcare access, sustainable urban planning, renewable energy technologies, and poverty eradication. These outcomes underscore the interdisciplinary essence of research on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and emphasize the necessity for collaborative endeavors across diverse academic fields in tackling intricate sustainability issues. It was evident that developed countries with established research infrastructure, such as the United States, the UK, China, and European nations, were the most prolific contributors. However, there was also a noticeable increase in research output from developing countries, reflecting a growing recognition of the SDGs’ relevance and the need to address specific regional challenges. The analysis delved into collaboration and co-authorship patterns among researchers. International collaborations were prevalent, indicating that SDG research is a global endeavor that transcends borders. Collaborations between researchers from different countries foster knowledge exchange, capacity building, and a more holistic approach to addressing the interconnected challenges of sustainable development. The analysis also highlighted specific research gaps that require urgent attention. While the technological aspects of achieving the SDGs, such as renewable energy and sustainable infrastructure, have received considerable attention, social and behavioral aspects, including gender equality, poverty eradication, and social justice, warrant greater emphasis. Integrating a holistic approach that synergizes both technological and social aspects is vital for ensuring the effectiveness and sustainability of our efforts. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) do not have a single main idea; they are a global plan for progress comprised of 17 connected goals. To reach these goals, everyone must work together from different areas, using various technology methods and ensuring everyone can access money. We also need to keep checking how things are going. The main lessons from the SDGs are that we should collaborate, use many methods, embrace technology, make sure everyone can access money, and keep a close watch on things. It is hard to find clear advice because the SDGs cover a lot, like getting rid of poverty, making sure everyone is treated somewhat, no matter their gender, taking care of the environment, and making the economy better. We can see progress in making policies, working together on projects, measuring data, and finding ways to fund these plans. Putting the SDGs into action shows that we need many people involved, new ways to get money, and good technological skills to make lasting progress. Studying the SDGs is complicated because they involve many different fields and targets, so we need better ways to measure how things are going. This means using many different sources, like academic papers and reports from governments and groups not part of the government, to understand what is happening. To fill in the gaps in our knowledge, we must keep researching and looking at things from many angles. This SDGs research publications study, while making notable contributions, has limitations. It exclusively relied on the Web of Science database, potentially overlooking relevant citations from other database sources. The manual screening process is time-consuming and challenging, and ongoing research may change citation counts. Addressing issues like author name ambiguity and non-uniform institution names is crucial. Our study identified potential redundancy in published works. While some repetition is normal, addressing this could free up research resources, enabling scholars to explore uncharted aspects of the SDGs. Researchers should adapt methodologies to capture real-time insights, incorporating dynamic data sources like social media and policy documents for a more nuanced understanding. Future studies should leverage AI-powered text-mining tools across multiple databases to overcome these limitations.
