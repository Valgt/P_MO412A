                  As the path of industrial eco-efficiency (IEE) needs to be re-examined from a multi-dimensional perspective, this research opens the internal “black box” of China's industrial eco-economic system driven by sustainable development goals (SDGs) and decomposes IEE into industrial production and sustainable development stages. It further divides the industrial production stage into two parallel subsystems of water use efficiency (WUE) and energy efficiency (EE) and derives SDG6 efficiency (SDG6E) and SDG7 efficiency (SDG7E) in the sustainable development stage respectively. The paper proposes a meta two-stage parallel entropy dynamic DDF-DEA model to re-measure IEE of 30 provinces in China from 2015 to 2021, discusses the relationship between overall efficiency and stage efficiency, and by using the Tobit model explores various types of influencing factors by subregion. The results show that the modified DDF-DEA model can explore China's IEE more accurately under SDGs. China's IEE is more stable from 2015 to 2021, with the efficiency value always fluctuating between 0.59 and 0.64, the overall level is low, and there is more room for improvement. There are significant inter-provincial differences in IEE and efficiency inertia. In more than 75% of the provinces SDG7E constrains IEE improvement, while the dynamic evolution of IEE and its subsystem efficiency varies across regions. Environmental regulation is a common factor affecting IEE across the country and in the east, central, and west regions, whereas the level of economic development, openness to the outside world, and urbanization rate are differential factors affecting IEE across the country and in the three major regions. This study offers new perspectives for exploring the path of IEE enhancement and providing empirical references for the collaborative construction of industrial ecological civilization.

Handling Editor: Jian Zuo As the path of industrial eco-efficiency (IEE) needs to be re-examined from a multi-dimensional perspective, this research opens the internal “black box” of China's industrial eco-economic system driven by sustainable development goals (SDGs) and decomposes IEE into industrial production and sustainable development stages. It further divides the industrial production stage into two parallel subsystems of water use efficiency (WUE) and energy efficiency (EE) and derives SDG6 efficiency (SDG6 E) and SDG7 efficiency (SDG7 E) in the sustainable development stage respectively. The paper proposes a meta two-stage parallel entropy dynamic DDF-DEA model to re-measure IEE of 30 provinces in China from 2015 to 2021, discusses the relationship between overall efficiency and stage efficiency, and by using the Tobit model explores various types of influencing factors by subregion. The results show that the modified DDF-DEA model can explore China's IEE more accurately under SDGs. China's IEE is more stable from 2015 to 2021, with the efficiency value always fluctuating between 0.59 and 0.64, the overall level is low, and there is more room for improvement. There are significant inter-provincial differences in IEE and efficiency inertia. In more than 75% of the provinces SDG7 E constrains IEE improvement, while the dynamic evolution of IEE and its subsystem efficiency varies across regions. Environmental regulation is a common factor affecting IEE across the country and in the east, central, and west regions, whereas the level of economic development, openness to the outside world, and urbanization rate are differential factors affecting IEE across the country and in the three major regions. This study offers new perspectives for exploring the path of IEE enhancement and providing empirical references for the collaborative construction of industrial ecological civilization.

However, the phenomenon of “three highs and one low” (high pollution, high emissions, high energy consumption. and low value-added) still exists in industrial development. The resulting series of problems, such as resource depletion and ecological damage, have seriously affected the healthy development of the economy and society, resulting in a contradiction between economic growth and the construction of an ecological civilisation, which is still prominent. China's industrial added value accounted for 32.6% of GDP in 2021. However, total industrial energy consumption accounted for 65.2% of the total energy consumption of society as a whole, and the proportion of industrial SO2  emissions in total emissions hit 76.2%. Moreover, the comprehensive utilization rate of general industrial solid waste is only 56.4%, as industrial wastewater emissions are increasing year by year. China's sustainable industrial development faces pressures on resource availability, ecosystem restoration, and improving IEE in the future (Zhang et al., 2022 ). SDGs are a system of binding targets and indicators formulated by the United Nations (UN) after the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in the hope of thoroughly resolving multidimensional development problems in the social, economic, and environmental fields. The UN has established an integrated set of SDGs with 17 goals and 169 sub-goals to guide the sustainable development of all regions over the next 15 years (2016–2030), including developed and developing countries. Among them, SDG6 (clean water and sanitation) and SDG7 (affordable and clean energy) deal with the efficient resource use of water and energy, which are particularly relevant to industrial ecosystems. A comprehensive evaluation of IEE is a systematic and complex project involving production, ecology, and life. Methodologically, the IEE literature focuses on the traditional one-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) model, which fails to reflect the internal structure of industrial ecosystems, ignores the fact that industrial ecosystems are complex and composed of multiple subsystems, and fails to take into account the interactions between subsystems within industrial ecosystems. Not only is it prone to ineffective use and serious waste of resources, it is also not conducive to easing the contradiction between supply and demand of resources for industrial production. In the theoretical framework, water and energy, as the two resources necessary for industrial production, jointly provide strong support for the sustainable development of industrial production and at the same time are the main sources of resource consumption and environmental pollution. However, few scholars have included water and energy in the same theoretical framework of analysis and have integrated them with the SDGs. Integrated evaluation of water, energy and sustainable development as a whole can provide new entry points for industrial systems to achieve sustainable and coordinated development. This study therefore utilizes a meta two-stage parallel entropy dynamic DDF-DEA model, using SDGs as a guideline, to explore China's IEE and stage efficiency (Stage 1.1: WUE; Stage 1.2: EE; Stage 2.1: SDG6 E; and Stage 2.2: SDG7 E) status in the new environment from 2015 to 2021. It applies the Tobit model to explore the influencing factors of IEE in different regions. Considering the above background, we hope to address the following questions through the research in this paper. Under the SDGs, how does a country scientifically and reasonably measure the operational efficiency of the total industrial ecosystem and sub-systems in order to better reflect the connotation of high-level synergistic creation of industrial ecological value and economic value? What are the advantages of IEE measured under this goal-oriented approach compared to IEE measured by traditional models? What is the current status of IEE in China by province? What are the subsystems that slow down the improvement of overall IEE? What are the regional differences in the efficiency of the IEE and its phases? Which external factors inhibit or facilitate the improvement of IEE? How can IEE be improved in the future under resource constraints and environmental constraints in order to promote sustainable green development of China's industries? This study has important theoretical and practical significance. Theoretical significance: (1) It broadens the research scope of IEE, expands the research perspective to the concept of sustainable development, which is closely related to all human beings, and further decomposes the IEE into the industrial production stage and the sustainable development stage, and according to the characteristics of the industrial system, divides the industrial production stage into WUE and EE, and extends SDG6 E and SDG7 E, respectively. (2) We enrich the tools for measuring the environment of industrial economy under resource constraints, and propose a meta two-stage parallel entropy dynamic DDF-DEA model for measuring China's IEE in the context of the new era. The network DEA approach is able to uncover more non-effective decision-making units (DMUs) and explore the constraints to IEE improvement from an insider's perspective than the results of a traditional single-stage DEA model. Similarly, the model is applicable to the agricultural sector, transport sector, etc. Practical significance: (1) Localization of the global indicator framework of SDGs to adapt to China's national conditions and combine with China's assessment requirements, and fully connecting with the indicators explicitly assessed in the national major policies and actions and plans, so as to assess the efficiency of SDG6 and SDG7 under SDGs. Of course, the design principles and ideas of the SDGs China localised evaluation indicator system proposed in this paper can also be applied to the other 15 goals. (2) The re-measurement of IEE from a new perspective helps to identify the potential for improvement in industrial ecological development and also helps to gain a more comprehensive and clearer understanding of the reality of industrial production under the new situation. Moreover, comparative analyses by region can provide a comprehensive scientific understanding of the respective advantages and disadvantages of the eastern, central and western regions in terms of IEE and its subsystems. (3) Sub-regional identification of external factors that may affect the improvement of IEE, and the design of supporting policy recommendations to provide data support for the formulation of regional and industrial resource and environmental development strategies to enhance overall efficiency. The rest of this paper runs as follows. Section 2  is the literature review. Section 3  is research methods and data sources. Section 4  is results’ analysis and discussion. Section 5  is conclusions and policy implications.  2 Literature review 2.1 Industrial eco-efficiency IEE is an integrated evaluation of the overall effects of economic growth, resources and environmental benefits by taking into account both industrial development and ecological benefits, and is a centralised expression of the promotion of sustainable industrial development, as well as an important basis for measuring the level of green industrial development (Huang et al., 2014 ; Wang and Yang, 2019 ; Yang et al., 2023 ). The scope of research on IEE is divided into different levels, including national and regional levels (Zhou et al., 2019 ; Matsumoto and Chen, 2021 ), provincial level (Han et al., 2021 ; Huang et al., 2021 ), urban level (Song et al., 2018 ), enterprise or industrial park level (Liu et al., 2020 ), and economic belt level. Examples include the Yangtze River Economic Belt (Liu et al., 2023 ), the Huaihe River Economic Belt (Zhao et al., 2022 ; Zhu et al., 2022 ), and the Songhua River Basin (Guo et al., 2016 ). Scholars mostly use non-parametric DEA to measure IEE, including CCR, SBM and EBM methods, while some scholars also use SFA methods to calculate IEE. Wang et al. (2023)  utilized the CCR model to calculate environmental efficiency of 36 industries in China under energy constraints. Guo et al. (2017)  utilized SBM-based models to evaluate eco-efficiency of coal-fired cogeneration power plants (160 units) in 31 Chinese eco-industrial zone. Jesus Hermoso-Orzáez et al. (2020)  calculated ecological efficiency of 28 EU member states via DEA and found 14 countries had low ecological efficiency. He and Zhu (2022)  advanced a dynamic hybrid two-stage DEA model to access the efficiency of industrial systems. Other methods for measuring IEE include data driven method (Liu et al., 2021 ), spatial interaction model (Han et al., 2021 ), regression analysis (Neves et al., 2022 ), etc. IEE is influenced by a number of factors (Jiang et al., 2023 ). Most scholars noted that R&D expenditure (Dai et al., 2016 ), production technology (Wang et al., 2019 ), GDP (Wang et al., 2019 ; Zhu et al., 2022 ), foreign capital (Dai et al., 2016 ), industrial upgrading (Zhou et al., 2019 ; Han et al., 2021 ; Shah et al., 2020 ), industrial agglomeration (Li et al., 2021 ; Gao et al., 2020 ), and environmental governance (Dai et al., 2022 ) have a certain impact on IEE.  2.2 Water use efficiency Water resources play an essential role in socioeconomic development, affecting all aspects of industry, agriculture, and residential life. Some scholars have devoted their research to the micro-level application efficiency of water resources, specifically analyzing the input and output efficiencies of water resources in specific enterprises or industries (Wang, 2018 ; Ramos et al., 2021 ). In specific measurements, the water resources supportive effect of economic growth is usually taken as the desired output, while the undesired output is the introduction of water environment pollution indicators such as wastewater discharge, chemical oxygen demand or ammonia nitrogen discharge as binding factors (Ma et al., 2022 ; Zhuang et al., 2022 ; Shi et al., 2022 ). Modelling has also started to apply network DEA models more often. Li and Ma (2015)  used meta-frontier SBM-undesirable models to analyze industrial WUE and its interfering factor. Li et al. (2021)  applied an improved dynamic-SBM method to estimate sewage treatment efficiency and sludge management efficiency in China. Zou and Cong (2021)  applied the directional distance function model to assess the efficiency of industrial water utilization in 30 provincial administrative regions (provinces) and influencing factors in China from the perspective of the spatial effect. Liu et al. (2020)  applied an optimized SBM-DEA model to calculate industrial water efficiency in China.  2.3 Energy efficiency With the increasing attention paid to energy saving and emission reduction, EE has also become the key to solving industrial efficiency and sustainable economic and social development. At present, scholarly research on EE mainly has focused on regional scope, measurement methods, influencing factors of energy efficiency, and other analysis. As for the scope of EE research, its research objects are mainly execute from two aspects. The first is the economy, such as the European region (Borozan, 2018 ), and the second is the national level. As far as China's regional EE research is concerned, it mainly focuses at the national and provincial levels (Zhu et al., 2019 ; Peng et al., 2020 ). EE measurement methods include DEA and SFA. The former is especially appropriate for multiple input and output efficiency analysis. Jebali et al. (2017)  used two-stage DEA to calculate EE in Mediterranean countries and Europe. Yang and Yang (2020)  employed a multiplicative network DEA model to analyze network energy efficiency and waste efficiency. Many different DEA models are used for the study of EE in China, such as game cross efficiency DEA (Yang and Wei, 2019 ), meta frontier super SBM (Yu et al., 2019 ), three stage data envelopment (Zhao et al., 2019 ), etc. The SFA method is a powerful technique that is highly sensitive to the choice of function form. It is often used in situations where multiple inputs are involved and a single output is desired. The research on factors affecting EE has focused on technological progress, industrial structure, energy price, economic level, urbanization level, and clean energy (Wang et al., 2019 ).  2.4 Sustainable development Since the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development released its research report "Our Common Future" in 1987, sustainable development has become an important interdisciplinary research field (Brundtland, 1987 ). Over the decades, it evolved into a sustainable science (Bettencourt and Kaur, 2011 ). The global sustainable development goals established in 2015 provide a systematic framework and approach for sustainable development assessment. At present, relevant research mainly focuses on two aspects of sustainable development. One is to analyze the background, process, content, impact on global sustainable development, and related strategic thinking of the promulgation of the 2030 agenda. The second aspect is to establish a system of indicator and method for monitoring sustainable development goals. According to the situation of different countries, the monitoring indicators should be improved locally (Mikulčić et al., 2022 ; Hellegers and van Halsema, 2021 ). For example, indicators that are inconsistent with local indicators should be replaced, yet can be corrected, or one can eliminate those indicators that do not have the conditions for localization at present. As the most commonly-used resources in economic and social development (Li et al., 2022 ; Kh'ng et al., 2021 ), localization of water and energy sustainable development goals and the relationship attract the attention by scholar. The prime target of SDG6 is around water security, which includes access to clean water and sanitation (Nkiaka et al., 2021 ). SDG7 are closely linked to energy. The main task is to achieve reliable and clean energy sources. In terms of exploring the localization of indicators, in SDG6 scholars have determined whether local water resources are sustainable by increasing indicators of environmental water quality, water biocapacity and water ecological footprint (Su et al., 2018 ; Wang et al., 2020 ). They have also considered the equity of water allocation, such as using the Gini coefficient to measure the equity of water allocation (Bajaj et al., 2022 ; Hu et al., 2016 ). In terms of SDG7, scholars mainly have measured the sustainable development goals of energy by studying power access, clean fuel acquisition, sewage treatment rate, and the establishment of innovation methods (Chen et al., 2021 ; Trinh and Chung, 2023 ). The interaction between SDG6 and SDG7 is also the main direction of research. Water and energy are closely linked, energy needs water in industrial production, and water extraction, distribution and treatment also need energy (Bazilian et al., 2011 ). Scholars have explored analytical frameworks such as water energy nexus and water energy food nexus. Yillia (2016)  believes that a large amount of water is needed to cool equipment in thermal power production, and the large amount of water used in thermal power industry affects the rational use of water resources in other industries, resulting in uneven distribution of water resources in the industrial sector. Rasul (2016)  noted that unsustainable use of resources in South Asian countries caused by poor coordination and institutional fragmentation among in the water and energy sectors, that decrease the sustainability of the water and energy security in the region for long-term, and obstacle to achieve the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Cheng et al. (2023)  applied a coupling model to study the relationships among SDG6, SDG7, and SDG2. The results show that the development levels of SDG6 and SDG7 in energy system and water system lag behind SDG2 in the grain system, and so it is necessary to improve the efficiency of water and energy utilization could promote sustainable development. The links between water and energy are embedded in social ecosystems (Liu et al., 2018 ). For example, forest vegetation plays an irreplaceable role in water, food and energy systems, with direct or indirect effects (Landholm et al., 2019 ; Melo et al., 2021 ). The relationship between energy consumption and carbon emissions is also significant, and the increasing energy consumption will lead to the rise of carbon emissions and the intensification of global warming (Wang et al., 2021 ). A small number of studies have begun to apply DEA models to sustainable development evaluation. Sustainable Development Efficiency (SDGE) integrally reflects the intrinsic connection between social development, economic development and environmental protection, and adheres to the sustainable development concept of inclusive growth and coordinated development of economy, society and environment. Some scholars have directly combined SDGs with input-output indicators, such as Issever Grochová and Litzman (2021)  who introduced DEA into the assessment of the level of SDGs realisation and the measurement of national progress. And more scholars actually measure the SDGE of a certain industry from the perspective of sustainable development. e.g. Khan et al. (2021)  used the DPSIR-SBM model to evaluate the SDGE of China's rural areas. Cheng et al. (2023)  used labour, capital and energy consumption as inputs, GDP as desired outputs and CO2  as non-desired outputs, applied the super-efficient SBM-DEA model to compare the SDGE of BRICS and G7 countries.  2.5 Discussion of the literature The literature is extremely fruitful, but there is still room for improvement, mainly in two aspects. On the one hand, IEE research is limited to the production stage, and most studies have adopted the traditional DEA model; i.e., the “black box” approach. The “black box” evaluation method focuses on overall comprehensive efficiency, which cannot reflect the internal structure of the industrial production system and is insufficient to analyze the stage-by-stage origin of the overall efficiency and comparatively analyze the efficiency at different stages. On the other hand, there is a lack of relatively systematic and in-depth analysis of the current situation and characteristics of IEE in China under the new situation. The concept of sustainable development requires industrial production to aim at “efficiency, harmony, and sustainability”. How to integrate SDGs into IEE research could become a new research theme. The research on how to localize SDGs’ indicators in China also has problems such as insufficient theory, insufficient systematicity, and insufficient practicality. This study aims for the following extensions. (1) A theoretical model of IEE assessment that meets China's national conditions is constructed with SDGs in mind (Fig. 1  ). A new theoretical analysis framework considering “production-sustainable development” is constructed, with WUE and EE in parallel as the first stage and SDG6 E and SDG7 E as the second stage. For the first time, both water and energy systems are considered in the industrial production stage, and the new requirements in the concept of sustainable development on industrial production are combined, and the related indicators of economic growth, resource consumption, pollution emission, pollution control, and sustainable development are included in the same model for comprehensive evaluation.(2) The traditional DEA model is improved, and a new dynamic parallel two-stage DDF-DEA model is constructed. It overcomes the weakness of the traditional DEA model that cannot fully reflect the internal structure and interconnection of the industrial production system. Under the premise of satisfying the DEA assumptions, the input and output indicators of the industrial production stage and the sustainable development stage are fully considered, which make the model closer to the actual situation of industrial production.  (3) This paper proposes a framework of a localized indicator system for SDGs in China. Due to inadequacy and imbalanced development, the main problems and concerns of each country and region in implementing SDGs are different. Thus, it is both necessary and challenging to construct a localized SDG indicator system.  (4) We explore the different factors that may affect IEE in the new situation by region. Provide reference support for the government's scientific decision-making, and provide realistic support for the practical work of industry to achieve sustainable development.      3 Methodology and data collection 3.1 Methodology Due to the better evaluation performance of the DDF non-radial distance function, it can provide more reasonable and accurate estimation results. However, the Färe and Grosskopf (2010)  DDF non-radial distance function fails to take into account the inter-period persistence effect, different stages, merged systems, and different production technologies. Therefore, this study modifies the conventional DDF model herein. Combining the Shannon (1948)  entropy model, Kao (2009)  parallel DEA model, Tone and Tsutsui (2014)  dynamic network DEA model, and O'Donnell et al. (2008)  common boundary (metafrontier) concept and proposing a meta two-stage parallel entropy dynamic DDF-DEA model, this model helps explore the SDG6 and SDG7 sustainable development efficiencies of 30 provinces in China. In the following, the entropy method is first introduced. Next, a meta two-stage parallel entropy dynamic DDF-DEA model is discussed. 3.1.1 The entropy method Due to the large number of sub-indicators covered in the model, the problem of not being able to solve the DEA model arises if the sub-indicators are included. Therefore, this model first adopts the Shannon (1948)  entropy method to compute a value by combining water consumption per capita, agricultural value added/total water use, and industry value added/total water use in the output term of stage 1.1. A value is calculated by combining the detailed indicators of wastewater, waste gas, and solid waste in the link items of stages 1.1–2.1. A value is calculated by combining the sub-indicators of wastewater treatment investment and industrial pollution control investment from the inputs of stage 2.1. The energy intensity, proportion of population using gas, and new/total energy indicators in stage 2.2 output are combined to produce a single value. See Table 1   for detailed indicators. Entropy method and steps.Step 1: Data standardization. Calculate the data mentioned in Table 1  above as follows.   (1) r m n   = max m  x m n   − x m n    max m  x m n   − min m  x m n      ( m = 1 , … , 30 ;  n = 1 , … , N  )          Here, r m n      is the standardized value of the n   th  indicator for the m   th  province; min m  x m n      is the minimum value of the n   th  indicator for the m   th  province; max m  x m n      is the maximum value of the n   th  indicator for the m   th  province.Step 2: Sum the standardized values for each variable.   (2) P m n   = R m n   ∑ n = 1  30  R m n      ( m = 1 , … , 30 ;  n = 1 , … , N  )          P m n      denotes the sum of the standardized values of the n   th  indicator of the m   th  provinces.Step 3: Calculate the entropy value (e n  )    of the nth indicator.   (3) e n  = − ( ln  30  )  − 1   ∑ m = 1  30  [ P m n    ln ( P m n   )   ]    ( m = 1 , … , 30 ;  n = 1 , … , N  )          Step 4: Calculate the weight of the nth indicator ( w n  )    .   (4) w n  = 1 − e n   ∑ n = 1  N  ( 1 − e n   )     ( n = 1 , … , N  )           Using the above steps, find the outputs in stage 1.1, the links from stages 1.1–2.1, the inputs in stage 2.1, the weights of the outputs in stage 2.2, and the values of the outputs. Based on the above entropy method, the meta two-stage parallel dynamic DDF-DEA model is introduced as meta two-stage parallel entropy dynamic DDF-DEA model. The model is described as follows.  3.1.2 A meta two-stage parallel entropy dynamic DDF-DEA model The decision-making unit D M U  j    ( j = 1 , … , N  )    under the efficiency frontier chooses the most favorable final weighted output, and so the efficiency of the DMU under the public frontier can be solved by the following linear planning process. The following equations are used to solve for the overall, period-by-period, phase-by-phase, and phase-by-phase efficiencies for each D M U p   . Suppose there are two stages in each t time period ( t = 1 , … , T  )   . In each time period, there are two stages: industrial production and sustainable development. Each D M U    under the frontier chooses the most favorable final weighted output. In each time period, there are two stages in each t    time periods. The first stage includes stage 1.1 (WUE) and stage 1.2 (EE). Stage 1.1 has B1 inputs f 1  b 1 j  t  ( b 1 = 1 , … , B 1  )    , a desirable output q 1  a 1 j  t  ( a 1 = 1 , … , A 1  )  , and  o 1  undesirable  outputs  U 1  o 1 j  t  ( o 1 = 1 , … , O 1  )  .    Stage 1.2 has B2 inputs f 2  b 2 j  t  ( b 2 = 1 , … , B 2  )    , a desirable output q 2  a 2 j  t  ( a 2 = 1 , … , A 2  )  , and  O 2  undesirable  outputs  U 2  o 2 j  t  ( O 2 = 1 , … , O 2  )    . The second stage includes stage 2.1 (SDG6 E) and stage 2.2 (SDG7 E). Stage 2.1 has I inputs  x 1  i j  t   ( i = 1 , … , I  )     to generate K    desirable outputs y 1  k j  t  ( k = 1 , … , K  )  .    Stage 2.2 has R inputs  x 2  r j  t  ( r = 1 , … , R  )     to generate S  desirable output y 2  s j  t  ( s = 1 , … , S  )    . z 1  h 1 j  t  ( h 1 = 1 … . H 1  )     links stage 1.1 and stage 2.1.   z 2  h 21 j  t  ( h 2 = 1 … . H 2  )     are the linkage variables from stage 1.1 to stage 1.2. w 1  v 1 j  t  ( v 1 = 1 … . V 1  )     links stage 1.2 and stage 2.2. w 2  v 2 j  t  ( v 2 = 1 … . V 2  )   are  the    linkage variables from stage 1.2 to stage 1.1.(1) Meta-frontier (MF)    Assume that due to differences in management type, resources, regulations, or environment, all firms (N   ) (j = 1 , . . . , N   ) consist of g    clusters of decision-making units (N = N 1  + N 2  + . . . + N G    ). At the common frontier, DMU p    chooses the final output weight that is most favorable to it and maximizes its efficiency value. Thus, the efficiency of DMU j    at the common frontier can be solved by the following linear programming procedure.(a) Objective function    The efficiency of D M U p    is: max  MFE = ∑ g = 1  G  ∑ t = 1  T  ( w g 1  t  θ g 1  t  + w g 2  t  θ g 2  t   )         Subject to: Stage 1.1: WUE (5) ∑ g = 1  G  ∑ j n  λ g j 1.1  t  f 1  g b 1 j 1.1  t  ≤ f 1  g b 1 p 1.1  t  −  θ  g 1.1  t  D g b 1 p 1.1  t   ∀ b 1 , t = 1 , 2 … .

IEE is a variable with non-negative truncation characteristics between 0 and 1. For an estimation of this type of restricted dependent variable, the OLS method usually yields biased results. Therefore, the panel Tobit model has become the most commonly used model. The Tobit model, also known as the sample model and the restricted dependent variable model, was first proposed by Tobin (1958)  and is a model in which the dependent variable takes on values in a continuous but restricted situation. It is suitable for a situation in which the dependent variable has a value of zero, while the other values are positive and continuous. In recent years, scholars have often used the Tobit model to analyze discontinuous dependent variables, especially those from DEA results (Wang et al., 2019 ; Shuai and Fan, 2020 ). The model set-up is:(14) Y i t  ′  = α 0  + β k  X i t   + ε i t      Y i t   = Y i t  ′   I f  Y i t  ′  > 0    Y i t   = 0  I f  Y  i t  ′  ≤ 0    i = 1 , 2 , … , 30    t = 2015 … , 2020            Here, Y i t  ′     is the explanatory variable; i.e., IEE. X i t      is the explanatory variable; i.e., the influencing factors of IEE. i    and t    denote the i   th  province and the t   th  year, respectively. α 0     is a constant term. β k     is the coefficient of the variable. ε i t      is the disturbance term.   3.2 Variables and data sources 3.2.1 IEE input and output indicators In order to continue the momentum of the MDGs and the unfinished business, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was unanimously adopted by the world's 193 leaders at the United Nations Development Summit in 2015, establishing the SDGs. Therefore, in order to explicitly consider the time-series change characteristics of IEE when SDGs are considered, and taking into account data availability, this paper takes 2015–2021 as the research period. The research objects are 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and cities in China (excluding Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and Tibet). According to the different stages included in the development of industrial ecology, and by referring to the research ideas of Shao et al. (2021) , the following steps are taken to screen the relevant indicators of SDG6 and SDG7 for localization in China (Fig. 2  ) and to construct the evaluation indicator system from the levels of input and output systems (Table 2  ). The relevant data are obtained from the China Statistical Yearbook, China Energy Statistical Yearbook, China Industrial Economic Statistical Yearbook, China Electric Power Yearbook, China Environmental Statistical Yearbook, National Environmental Statistical Bulletin, China Water Resources Statistical Yearbook, and China Regional Economic Statistical Yearbook in the past years. Table 2  shows the descriptive statistical information of the sample, which to some extent reflects the imbalance of development between regions. Detailed information on the indicators is shown below. Stage 1.1: WUE  Input variables: Hydraulic labor force: Employed persons in urban units in the water, environment, and utilities management industry (104  people). Total water supply: Total annual water supply by province (108  CNY). Refers to the gross volume of water, including transmission losses, provided to water users from all water sources. Output variables: Desirable output: GDP: Annual gross domestic product (GDP) of each province (108  CNY). Water consumption per capita (6.1): Annual per capita water consumption by province (cubic meters per person). Agricultural value added/total water use (6.4): Annual value added of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries/total water use in each province. The total amount of water used here refers to the gross amount of water taken by each type of water user, including transmission losses. Industry value added/total water use (6.4): Annual value added of industry/total water use in each province. Undesirable output and linkage variables (from stage 1.1 to stage 2.1): Wastewater: Total annual wastewater discharges by province (104  ton). This data is the sum of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Ammonia Nitrogen discharges, Total Nitrogen, Total Phosphorus, Petroleum Species and Volatile Phenols discharges from wastewater. Waste gas: Annual industrial emissions by province (104  ton). This data is the sum of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and smoke (dust) emissions from exhaust gases. Solid waste: Annual generation of general industrial solid waste by province (104  ton). This refers to the total amount of solid, semi-solid and highly concentrated liquid waste generated by an enterprise during the production process. Linkage variables from stage 1.1 to stage 1.2: Energy water: Total annual industrial water use in each province (104  m3 ). Water used by industrial and mining enterprises for manufacturing, processing, cooling, air-conditioning, purification, washing, etc., in the course of production, based on the amount of new water withdrawn, excluding the amount of water reused within the enterprise. Stage 1.2: EE  Input variables: Energy labor force: Employment in urban units of the electricity, heat, gas, and water production and supply industry (104  people). Energy consumption (7.1): Total annual energy consumption by province (tons of standard coal). It refers to the sum of all kinds of energy consumed by all sectors of the national economy and households in a certain geographical area over a certain period of time. Output variables: Desirable output: Economic benefit: Annual value added of the secondary sector in each province (108  CNY). Undesirable output and linkage variables (from stage 1.2 to stage 2.2): Energy carbon emission: Total annual carbon emissions (104  ton) of raw coal, coke, crude oil, gasoline, paraffin, diesel, fuel oil, natural gas, and electricity in each province based on the IPCC (2007) calculation method. Linkage variables from stage 1.2 to stage 1.1: Hydroelectricity: Total annual hydroelectricity generation by province (billion kilowatt hours). Stage 2.1: SDG 6  E  Input variables: Wastewater treatment investment (6.3): Investment in wastewater treatment projects completed (108  CNY). Industrial pollution control investment (6.3): Completed investment in industrial pollution control (108  CNY). Output variables: Volume of solid waste consolidated: Comprehensive use of general industrial solid waste per year by province (104  ton). Wastewater treatment capacity (6.4): Total annual sewage treatment by province (104  ton). Stage 2.2: SDG 7  E  Input variables: Environmental protection expenditure: Expenditure on it in local finances (108  CNY). Output variables: Energy intensity (7.1): Energy consumption per unit of GDP. Proportion of population using gas (7.1): Percentage of population using gas from non-renewable sources. New/total energy (7.2): New energy generation/total energy generation, with new energy generation being nuclear, wind, and solar combined. Intertemporal carry-over variable: Fixed asset investment: Total annual investment in fixed assets by province (108  CNY). It is a general term for the amount of work done by society as a whole to build and acquire fixed assets and the costs associated with this in a certain period of time, expressed in monetary terms. As the total investment in fixed assets is no longer published in the China Statistical Yearbook from 2018 onwards, the data for 2018–2021 are manually collated based on the growth of investment in fixed assets over the previous year in the China Statistical Yearbook.  3.2.2 Influencing factors of IEE Combined with the reality of industrial production development and after considering data availability, this paper mainly refers to the studies of Fujii and Managi (2013) , Fan et al. (2017) , Zhou et al. (2019) , and Liu and Fang (2022)  to select the following indicators for empirical analysis (Table 3  ).(1) Level of economic development (PGDP), expressed as GDP per capita, is logarithmized to reduce the heteroskedastic effect of economic fluctuations. Many economies tend to neglect environmental protection in the process of development in order to achieve rapid economic growth gains in the early stages of industrial development. The quality of their regional environment thus deteriorates to a certain extent as the level of economic development increases. However, when the level of economic development increases to a degree, sustainable production begins to be valued by all sectors of society, and environmental quality will continue to improve (Shahbaz et al., 2013 ; Shi et al., 2020 ).  (2) Level of openness to the outside world (FDI) is expressed as the ratio of foreign direct investment to GDP. Opening up to the outside world is a double-edged sword for the construction of industrial ecological civilization (Xuan et al., 2020 ). According to the Pollution Paradise Hypothesis, foreign-funded enterprises usually transfer pollution-intensive industries or high-energy-consumption projects to the host country, resulting in the destruction of the host country's ecological environment (Ma et al., 2019 ; Quito et al., 2023 ). According to the Pollution Halo Hypothesis, the entry of foreign capital can bring technological demonstration and generate knowledge spillovers, which help improve environmental quality in the long run (Abbasi et al., 2023 ; Ozkan et al., 2023 ).  (3) Urbanization (URB) is expressed as the proportion of urban residents to the total population. China is in the process of rapid urbanization, and the new opportunities for population migration and industrial change brought about by it also impact water and energy consumption demand and utilization levels (Bahtebay et al., 2021 ; Li et al., 2022 ).  (4) Environmental regulation (ER) is expressed as the share of industrial pollution control investment in value added of secondary industry. From the traditional view of development economics, the environmental protection and economic development nexus is often in a difficult balance (Wang et al., 2019 ). The main reason is that an increase in the intensity of environmental regulation inevitably enhances pollutant emission reduction and raises production costs of industrial enterprises. Relatively high production costs to a certain extent negatively impact the development of enterprises - that is, it is difficult to balance the development of the industrial economy and environmental protection and to achieve a win-win situation (Ye and Wang, 2019 ; Zhang et al., 2020 ).       4 Results and discussion 4.1 Overall efficiency analysis 4.1.1 Comparison of IEE for different models The combined efficiency is IEE. In order to elucidate the advantages of the dynamic parallel two-stage DEA model by considering the SDG case over previous models, we compare its results with those of the traditional one-stage DEA model (Fig. 3  ). Referring to studies on IEE by Wang et al. (2019) , Fan et al. (2017) , and others, this study applies the DDF-DEA model by considering non-desired outputs, with the number of employed persons per urban unit, energy consumption, and the total amount of industrial water as input indicators, industry value added as desired output, total amount of wastewater discharges, amount of industrial emissions, and amount of general industrial solid wastes generated as non-desired outputs, and amount of fixed assets as desired output. Total wastewater emissions, industrial emissions, and general industrial solid waste generation are non-desired outputs. Fixed asset investment is the carry-over. IEE under the traditional model is then calculated. We find from 2015 to 2021 that China's IEE, by considering SDG, is significantly lower than its IEE under the traditional model. The trend of traditional IEE is first increasing and then decreasing, with the highest point occurring in 2020 at 0.985. IEE, by considering SDG, shows an overall "falling-rising-falling" trend with fluctuating development characteristics and with the two high points occurring in 2015 and 2017. In 2017, IEE hit the highest point in seven years, but it was only 0.634. As China enters a new political cycle and a new stage of economic development, the state attaches great importance to environmental protection and industrial green development. While removing production capacity and stabilizing industry growth, it has stepped up its efforts to combat industrial pollution, and energy conservation and the circular economy in the industrial sector are advancing rapidly. However, in this process, IEE fluctuates and efficiency loss occurs due to the sluggish external demand and insufficient kinetic energy of the industrial economy under the constraint of the three-phase superposition. Therefore, IEE of SDG is more in line with the reality of China's industrial development and is also consistent with the government's constraints on carbon and pollutant emissions. The common point of the two types of results is that none of their measured IEE reaches 1, and China's overall IEE still has a large room for improvement. It can be seen that the consideration of SDGs has a significant impact on the measurement of IEE, and the results obtained through the dynamic parallel two-stage DEA model constructed in this paper can avoid the overestimation of IEE, and can improve the accuracy and credibility of the results.  4.1.2 Temporal variation of IEE Fig. 4   shows the trend and mean value of IEE for the 30 provinces from 2015 to 2021 after taking SDGs into account. There are significant differences in IEE among different provinces, with the highest mean values in Shandong and Qinghai. Both are 1, reaching the efficiency frontier, and so they are a target for other provinces to learn from and to catch up with. The third, fourth and fifth highest mean values of IEE are in Hainan, Tianjin and Ningxia, with efficiency values of 0.973, 0.879 and 0.792, respectively. Overall, 60% of the provinces with the top five mean values of IEE are located in the east region of the country. Driven by both location and policy advantages, these provinces have achieved high-quality growth of their industrial economy under the intensive model. At the same time, through the advantages of advanced technology, they have made great progress in optimizing their industrial structure and environmental management and achieved a high level of IEE development. Qinghai and Ningxia, on the other hand, are located in the west region. With the implementation of strategies such as China's so-called Western Development, it relies on its resource advantages, carries out ecological compensation, and drives economic growth through the development of the tertiary industry, thus improving IEE. The last five regions in the ranking of the mean value of IEE are Jilin, Guangxi, Guizhou, Inner Mongolia and Gansu, with the efficiency values ranging from 0.32 to 0.40. They are mainly distributed in the central or west regions. These provinces are constrained by their own resources and location conditions. They have strong resource dependence and uneconomical production methods brought about by high-energy-consuming and high-polluting manufacturing industries, leading to a lack of power in industrial economic efficiency. This causes ecosystem fragility and restricts the process of sustainable development. Provincial IEEs also show varying degrees of trend. Based on the overall trend of the 30 provinces in Fig. 4  over the study period, we can categorise them into three groups: a stable group (Shandong and Qinghai), an increasing group (Tianjin, Zhejiang, Hebei, Henan, Shaanxi, Yunnan, and Heilongjiang), and a decreasing group (Hainan, Ningxia, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Anhui, Liaoning, Fujian, Xinjiang, Hubei, Shanxi, Hunan, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Jilin, Guangxi, Guizhou, Inner Mongolia, and Gansu). The stable group achieves IEE of 1 in both 2015–2021. Some large industrial production provinces have maintained higher IEE or better development trend, which shows that under the construction of industrial ecological civilisation and sustainable development strategy, these provinces pay more and more attention to the overall ecological environmental protection, and continuously strengthen the ecological and environmental pollution control of all aspects of the industrial production process, but there is still a certain gap with the distance of industrial production inputs from the ideal marginal efficiency frontier. There are also some large industrial production provinces that are in an inefficient or declining trend, such as Shanxi and Liaoning, which may be explained by the scale effect of water and energy consumption that has exacerbated the decline in IEE and environmental pollution, coupled with an over-concentration on the immediate resource dividend at the expense of technological and structural upgrading of the industry, as well as the concept of sustainable development, and falling into a "low-level trap".   4.2 Stage efficiency analysis In order to explore the constraints to improving IEE from an internal perspective, this paper opens up the 'black box' and examines which stages in different regions are slowing down the improvement of IEE. Table 4   shows the efficiency values of the first and second phases of parallelism and marks the parts that need to be prioritized to increase the efficiency values in different phases and provinces. 4.2.1 Industrial production stage In the parallel industrial production stage, WUE is higher than EE in most provinces. In this stage, there are 12 provinces with both WUE and EE reaching 1: Shanghai, Shandong, Tianjin, Beijing, Jiangsu, Hainan, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Ningxia, Qinghai and Chongqing. Of these provinces, 75% are located in the east region and 25% in the west region. These provinces represent the most advanced regions in China in terms of industrial water and energy efficiency under environmental constraints and. Provinces with WUE of 1 yet poor EE performance include Hebei and Xinjiang. Xinjiang is an arid region under arid water allocation. As an arid region, its water allocation situation is optimal, and so it is worth learning from its experience in energy and water use, but it needs to focus on improving EE while maintaining the efficient use of water resources. There are 16 provinces where both WUE and EE do not reach 1. Among them, WUE is higher than EE in 11 provinces, such as Liaoning, Shanxi, and Hunan. EE is dragging down the improvement of the efficiency value of the industrial production stage, and these provinces need to prioritize its improvement. For example, Heilongjiang and Shanxi, as the representative regions of China's old industrial bases, are affected by structural and systemic contradictions and other historical legacy problems and have failed to realize the fundamental innovation of the traditional development mode. Hebei, Yunnan, and other regions are more likely to have low EE due to the conflict between economic growth and energy consumption. Provinces with EE higher than WUE, such as Jilin, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei and Shaanxi, have prioritized the need to improve WUE, because it spurs overall efficiency of the industrial production phase, despite the fact that these provinces have initially set up a stringent water resource management system and have piloted the establishment of water rights and water trading. However, these provinces' wastewater discharge has remained high for a long time, which has become the main shortcoming of WUE. There is still a long way to go to strengthen water conservation, emission reduction, and regulation.  4.2.2 Sustainable development stage In the sustainable development stage, over 75% of the provinces have SDG6 E higher than SDG7 E, and the number of provinces (only 2; Shandong and Qinghai) with SDG6 E and SDG7 E both reaching 1 is much less than those in the industrial production stage. These two provinces are able to actively implement the concept of sustainable development, effectively integrate industrial production resources, and maintain balanced development of the industrial sector in terms of production, ecology, and economy. The provinces with SDG6 E of 1 yet low SDG7 E are Tianjin, Beijing, Jiangsu, Guangdong, and Anhui, with Beijing having the worst performance of SDG7 E at 0.093. These provinces have an imbalance in the co-ordination between energy consumption and natural systems and lack the hard support of modern energy sustainability. Only Hainan and Ningxia have SDG7 E of 1, while its SDG6 E does not reach 1 with an efficiency value of 0.890 and 0.169. This means the province has seriously neglected the green and sustainable development of water resources, and that the increase in WUE comes at the expense of environmental sustainability. The number of provinces where both SDG6 E and SDG7 E do not reach the efficiency frontier is 21. Among them, the number of provinces with SDG6 E higher than SDG7 E is 18, including Shanghai, Hebei, Zhejiang, Fujian and so on. In their pursuit of growth, these provinces have neglected quality improvement, resulting in energy being wasted, which runs contrary to China's goal of sustainable development. For example, Chongqing's SDG7 E is only 0.146, and the city's energy consumption has entered a period of rapid growth. The policy of “Sichuan Electricity to Protect Chongqing, Chongqing Coal Self-sufficiency” that has long dominated Chongqing's energy development orientation is no longer applicable. Coal consumption has changed from “supply exceeds demand and slightly exported” to “coal transfer”, and coal and other energy external dependencies are increasing. This paper argues that Chongqing's misaligned energy positioning has delayed the construction of the city's energy system, resulting in a low SDG7 E. Sichuan has the lowest SDG7 E at only 0.080. The SDG7 E values of Gansu, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia are better than SDG6 E's. All three provinces are constrained by unfavorable geographic conditions and water resources and have weak industrial bases. Industrial products are mainly concentrated in the fields of raw materials and low-end manufacturing, and the extension of the industrial chain is restricted, making the transformation and upgrading of industrial structure difficult. Further development and consumption of water come at the expense of the environment, thus limiting the green and sustainable development of industrial water.  4.2.3 Overall perspective The last column in Table 4  shows the stage efficiencies that need to be prioritized for improvement in order to lift IEE of the provinces from an overall perspective. Except for Shandong, and Qinghai, which are at the efficiency frontier, the remaining 28 provinces can improve their IEE by raising the efficiency of their stage. Twenty-three provinces, including Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beijing, need to prioritize SDG7 E, where the sustainable development of clean energy has become a pain point, constraining IEE improvement in these provinces. Hainan, Gansu, Ningxia, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia need to prioritize the improvement of SDG6 E, with clean drinking water, water pollution prevention, and efficient water resource management as their focus for IEE improvement. How to narrow the regional gaps and achieve win-win development are key tasks for the sustainable development of the industrial economy in the future.   4.3 Regional comparative analysis Fig. 5   shows the regional trends in efficiency values in IEE and its different phases. Over the time span, except for SDG7 E, the IEE and its remaining phases have a general pattern of “Eastern Leadership”, but with significant regional differences. Relying on its own resource endowment conditions and diversified ecosystems, the east region has a strong ability to utilize resources and the environment. With the advantages of opening up to the outside world, scientific and technological innovation, and information technology overflow, the east region has become the main support force for China's economic development, and the pressure on resources and the environment has gradually fallen, thus becoming the zone with the highest IEE, WUE, EE, and SDG6 E among the three regions. The evolution of the national efficiency averages shows that IEE, SDG6 E and SDG7 E all show an overall decreasing trend, while WUE and EE show an overall increasing trend. The regional distribution of IEE is "East > West > Central". It is noteworthy that the central region, as the transition zone of China's economy, does not shown a higher IEE than that expected in the west. The main reasons for this are the relatively lagging technological innovation and the high proportion of high energy-consuming industries, resulting in the central region's ability to enhance the conservation and intensification of industrial resource use is limited. On the other hand, the west is driven by policies such as the Western Development Strategy. Although the location advantage, industrial base and the abundance of factors of production are also relatively weak, the main body of the industrial structure in provinces and cities such as Qinghai, Ningxia and other provinces and cities does not rely on industrial growth, but focuses on the development of animal husbandry and tourism. This results in a higher IEE under the input-output framework than that for the central region. The regional distribution of WUE, EE and SDG6 E is similar, with the efficiency values in the study period following a pattern of "first in the east, second and third in the centre and west in phases". Regional distribution of WUE: 2015 and 2018–2021, East > West > Central; 2016–2017, East > Central > West. SDG6 E: 2015 and 2017–2021, East > Central > West, 2016, East > West > Central. Although the industrial economic level of the west region is in a relatively backward state, with the deepening strategy of developing the west region, its resource advantages and the increasingly mature industrial production technology provide strong support for sustainable development of its industrial ecology and industrial water use, enabling it to catch up with the central region occasionally. Regional distribution of EE: 2015–2016 and 2019, East > Central > West; 2017–2018 and 2020–2021, East > West > Central. During the study period, China adopted the ideas of “controlling the east, stabilizing the central region, and developing the west” and “successive construction in the east, moderate construction in the central region, and key construction in the west” in the layout of coal development. The government encourages large energy groups to develop and promote coal and other energy resources in the west region. However, due to capacity and environmental constraints, coal and other production capacities in the west region cannot be released on a large scale in the short term. More coal resources are also consumed and utilized internally in the west region. SDG7 E shows a distribution pattern of “the east and west regions are alternately in first place, with the central being the lowest”. As the state attaches importance to the construction of ecological environment and the requirements of regional sustainable development, the east and west regions by virtue of their advantages of resource endowment, geographic advantages, policy advantages, etc. are able to gradually balance the coordinated development of industrial economy and ecology. The central region is reduced to the "depression" of SDG7 E. It can be seen that the central region has more abundant energy resources, but its latecomer advantage is not as good as the west region, and it has insufficient power to enhance the sustainable development of new energy. On the other hand, the central region's innate advantages are inferior to the east region, and there is a large gap in its scale of industrial economy versus the east region. In order to achieve economic development, the control of energy consumption and carbon emissions will be slightly insufficient.  4.4 Analysis of influencing factors There are some differences in the factors affecting IEE at the national and different regional levels. Moreover, the intensity, direction, and significance of the impacts of the same influencing factors on IEE at the national and different regional levels are different. Therefore, this study carries out Tobit regression analyses for the whole country and the east, central, and west regions from 2015 to 2021. The regression results appear in Table 5  . The impact of PGDP on IEE in the national, eastern and western regions is significantly negative, indicating that the level of economic development inhibits IEE improvement in the national, eastern and western regions. The traditional crude development model has brought about high GDP development in the whole country and in the eastern and western region, but also led to large consumption of fossil energy and water resources. The environmental cost of economic development has been rising, and the high energy consumption characteristics of the economy are clearly highlighted. The shift from a "resource factor-driven" to a "green development-driven" model of regional economic development has yet to be fully realised. Although the coefficient of influence of PGDP on IEE in the central region is negative, this influence is not significant. FDI shows a significantly positive correlation on IEE in the western region, but there is an impediment to the improvement of IEE in the national and eastern regions. On the one hand, the increasing level of external openness helps expand the space of industrial innovation resources in the western region, compensates for the disadvantage of the lack of urban innovation factor endowment, and provides potential room for profit. On the other hand, related technology enterprises can also integrate advanced industrial production technologies from western countries through trade interactions, accelerating the enhancement of the western region's overall scientific and technological capabilities. This will lead to IEE improvement in the western region. In order to pursue economic growth, some provinces in the east region have lowered the threshold of FDI access, over-introduced the quantity of FDI, and neglected the quality. This means that the effect of opening up to the outside world upon IEE is negative. For the central region, the impact of FDI on its IEE is insignificantly negative. URB has a non-significant effect on IEE in the national, east and central regions, with a significant positive effect in the west region. An increase in the level of URB can promote IEE in national, east and west regions. This effect is significant only within the west region and is an important driving force for the improvement of IEE there. The increase in the level of urbanization accelerates decomposition of the urban-rural dichotomy and provides important human and market support for the progress of industrialization and the trading of industrial goods in the west region. Although not significant, URB has a negative effect on IEE in the central region. This is probably because urbanization in the central region as a whole has yet to get rid of the traditional model. Moreover, the process of actively launching new city construction in various regions has eroded agricultural space and green ecological space, expanded industrial development space, aggravated the dependence on the path of crude industrial development, and inhibited IEE improvement, although this role is not obvious. ER exerts a significant negative inhibitory effect on IEE improvement nationally, in the east, central and west regions, and is the primary influencing factor nationally and among the three major regions. Generally speaking, ER can limit and reduce the emission of regional pollutants to a certain extent, which can produce a green effect and promote the Innovation. Appropriate ER can also reduce the additional environmental costs of economic growth and improve inter-regional "race to the bottom". However, excessive environmental regulatory pressure can increase management costs and difficulties. Once beyond the affordability of industrial enterprises will produce negative effects, and even a threat to the survival of enterprises. This paper adopts the method of replacing variables to test the robustness of the main regression results. Given that some scholars use the proportion of completed investment in industrial pollution control and value added of industry to indicate ER (Wenbo and Yan, 2018 ; Xu and Xu, 2022 ), the original indicator is replaced with this indicator, and other variables are kept unchanged, and the specific Tobit regression results are shown in Table 6  . Compared with the main regression results in Table 5 , there is no significant difference in the direction and significance of the role of each explanatory variable on the national, eastern, central, and western regions' IEE in Table 6 , and the size of each regression coefficient is changed, and the conclusions reached are basically the same. The size of each regression coefficient has changed, and the conclusion drawn is basically the same as the previous one. Taken together, the empirical results of this paper are robust.   5 Conclusion and policy implications 5.1 Conclusions and discussion Based on the meta two-stage parallel entropy dynamic DDF-DEA model, this study divides the evaluation of China's IEE in 2015–2021 into parallel industrial production stage and sustainable development stage. WUE, EE, SDG6 E, and SDG7 E are evaluated separately, and the changes in efficiency and the influencing factors are analyzed. The following main conclusions are drawn.(1) The modified DEA model can explore China's IEE more accurately under SDGs. Compared with IEE under the traditional model, this model effectively avoids the bias of efficiency estimation, which is more in line with the reality of industrial production. China's IEE as a whole is characterized by a "falling-rising-falling" shape fluctuating growth, with two high points occurring in 2015 and 2017 respectively. However, during the study period, IEE is always between 0.59 and 0.64, the overall level is low, and there is still much room for its improvement in China. It can be seen that the dual constraints of resources and environment faced by the sustainable development of China's industrial ecological economy are still further tightening as the dual pressures of resources and environment at home and abroad continue to increase.  (2) The inter-provincial differences in IEE are obvious. Only Shandong and Qinghai reached the efficiency frontier in IEE during the study period, while the remaining 28 provinces have varying degrees of room for improvement, with 75% of them in a fluctuating downward trend. Provinces with high IEE efficiency are able to maintain a consistently high level, while inefficient provinces have difficulty in improving rapidly, suggesting that there is efficiency inertia in regional IEE. This may be due to the superior external environment and stochastic factors in high-efficiency regions, as well as the fact that high-efficiency regions have a higher level of management and utilization of factors such as water and energy compared to low-efficiency regions.  (3) When the "black box" is opened, the internal triggers that constrain IEE improvement vary from region to region. EE in 13 provinces, including Xinjiang and Hebei, constrains the improvement of efficiency in the industrial production stage. SDG7 E in 23 provinces, including Shanghai and Tianjin, drags down the improvement of efficiency in the sustainable development stage. SDG7 E in 23 provinces, including Shanghai and Tianjin, is a “sore point” for IEE improvement, while SDG6 E in Hainan, Gansu, Ningxia, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia lowers IEE. Although these areas are the short board provinces and cities affecting national and regional IEE, they are also important driving forces for improving IEE in the later stage, which needs to attract the attention of national and local government departments.  (4) There are significant regional differences in the efficiency of IEE and its different subsystems. The distribution pattern of IEE is "East > West > Central", and the regional distribution of WUE, EE and SDG6 E is similar, with the efficiency value in the study period being "the first in the East, and the second and the third in the central and western regions in stages". The commonality lies in the fact that the central and eastern parts of the country have always been in the "leader" position in the regional distribution pattern. While the spatial distribution of SDG7 E is east > west alternately in first place and the other second, the centre is the lowest. In the formulation and implementation of industrial policies, different regions also focus on the development of industry, and thus this disparity in the level of sustainable industrial development between regions in China has always existed.  (5) The promotion of IEE improvement is the result of the interaction and superimposition of a variety of external factors, and the intensity and direction of the influence of each factor is characterised by obvious regional heterogeneity. PGDP, FDI and ER significantly impede IEE improvement in the whole country. At the regional level, PGDP has a dampening effect on IEE improvement in the eastern and western regions. FDI has a limited constraining effect on IEE in the central region, but can significantly contribute to the improvement of IEE in the western region and inhibit the development of IEE in the eastern region. URB had a positive contributing effect on IEE only in the western regions, with no significant effect in the eastern and central regions. ER had a significant hindering effect on IEE improvement in the eastern, central and western regions. How to improve IEE at multiple scales according to local conditions and time will be the focus of China's high-quality economic development.     5.2 Policy implications Currently facing outstanding problems such as tightening resource constraints and serious environmental pollution, China's industrial ecosystems need to be orientated towards sustainable development, have the operational goal of high-level synergistic creation of economic and ecological values, and continuously improve their operational efficiency. In view of the research status and findings of this paper, the following three suggestions are put forward.(1) Overcoming the problems of low level and slow growth of IEE requires differentiated strategies for filling the shortcomings in each province. For provinces that need to prioritize SDG7 E improvement, it is necessary to continuously optimize the structure of energy consumption, change the mode of “polluting first and treating later”, and take the road of sustainable development, so as to achieve a win-win situation between industrial development and ecological protection. For provinces that have to give priority to improving WUE or SDG6 E, for the former they should pay more attention to improving the mechanism of water resource utilization and optimizing the allocation of resources. For the latter, they should further smooth the flow channels of regional water use, water conservation capital, knowledge and technology, and other basic elements and enhance the virtuous cycle of water ecology, thus contributing to the sustainable use of water resources and sustainable and coordinated development of the industrial economy.  (2) In response to the current situation of unbalanced regional development of industrial production systems, it is necessary to strengthen inter-regional collaboration and form a new industrial pattern of complementary advantages and division of labor. Under the idea of synergistic governance that takes a holistic approach and focuses on breakthroughs, appropriate industrial and environmental policies need to be formulated according to local conditions. The cross-regional transfer of high-quality resources from the eastern coastal areas to the central and west regions should be strengthened. The cross-regional promotion of advanced experiences from efficient regions to inefficient regions can be enhanced. Lastly, governments at all levels can improve regional information exchange and sharing platforms, open up information circulation channels, and form a common and shared industrial ecological green development and sustainable development system.  (3) The authorities should jointly control the key factors affecting a region and take multiple measures to comprehensively promote sustainable development of the industrial ecological economy. They can focus on development quality of the industrial economy, vigorously implement clean production methods, accelerate the transformation of traditional industrial enterprises to digitalization and intelligence, and realize the transformation of the economic growth mode to greening. Further actions can be instituted to improve the appraisal mechanism for local governments and business leaders, to step out of the traditional misunderstanding of “GDP only”, and to focus on strengthening the construction of “green GDP”. A better environment for urban development through top-level design should be created that reasonably guides the concentration level and allocation efficiency of production factors. Lastly, while attracting inflow of foreign capital through the formulation of proactive local fiscal and financial policies is beneficial, it is also necessary to raise the green threshold upon the entry of foreign capital.     5.3 Outlook The research in this paper is to some extent a new understanding of the current industrial sustainable development and industrial ecological civilisation, which opens the “black box” under the traditional IEE model from the SDG perspective, and is innovative in terms of theme and methodology. However, due to data and space limitations, this paper has the following space that can be optimized and expanded: First, the choice of time scale. Considering the time of the proposal of SDGs and the availability of data, this paper chooses 2015–2021 as the research period, while efficiency is a dynamically changing development process, and the data analysis of a longer time period will illustrate a more complete picture. Therefore, we will continue to track the development trend of IEE in the future. Second, the choice of regional division. This paper only focuses on the heterogeneity of IEE among eastern, central and western regions, and subsequent studies should reveal regional differences in IEE from more perspectives. For example, regions divided according to different resource types. Subsequent research could deepen the tracking and refinement around these shortcomings.   Ethical approval 'Not applicable'.
