Edited by Tom Welton  A brief review of Chilean policies on sustainability along with the academic efforts related to green chemistry, in order with this new scenario are discussed. Topics considered are extraction processes, new solvents, CO2  transformation and emerging photovoltaics materials.    Chile is a developing country, its economy despite past efforts; still depends on natural resources such as mining and raw materials exports, with low added value that strongly pressures the environment. On the other hand, Chile as a member of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) faces environmental challenges from its partners in terms of competitiveness, such as the green mining concept . It is certain that Chile will not be a developed country if it does not initiate a technological revolution in the medium term, since no country-in the modern era-has achieved these objectives without generating a change in the means of production of its economy [1] . However, for the twenty-first century scenario, it is no longer enough to improve only technologically but also in terms of sustainability. Fortunately, the National Council for Innovation and Development (CNID for its acronym in Spanish) along with the scientific agencies and the Ministries of Energy, Mining, Environment and Economy have drawn road maps that motivate the use of renewable energies, to replace fossil fuels, on which Chile depends almost entirely, sustainable mining and solar photovoltaics among others [2] . For instance, government agencies launched a contest whose objectives were development of photovoltaic solar technology for desert climates and high radiation, to design new technologies that can be commercialized within a maximum period of 10 years. One of the objectives of the contest is to reduce the level cost (LCOE) of this type of technology to a level of $ 25 USD/MWh per year 2025 [2] . On the other hand, the concept of green mining have been introduced by the relevant stakeholders, where carbon neutral technologies, efficient and sustainable management of tails; and the introduction of H2  in diesel engines and fuel cells as an energy transition vector, among others are the main issues that will be considered in the short term [2] . These guidelines of short and medium term actions places our country in a promising scenario in terms of its future sustainable development by 2050. From the academic point of view, the following paragraphs describe specific advances in the field of Green Chemistry in Chile, along with the policies explained above, which we have identified as significant examples. In the replacement of traditional hydrocarbon-derived toxic organic solvents by solvents less harmful for the environment [3–6] , in Chile supercritical fluids (SCFs) and Ionic liquids (ILs) have been used mainly in extraction processes [7–13] . In addition, ionic liquids and bio-based solvents (BBS) have appeared as the most promising approaches for the replacement of volatile organic solvents (VOS) [14–16] . They have been used as reaction media in several organic processes [17–19] , synthesis [20]  and degradation of toxic compounds [21,22] . For instance, recently Pavez et al., demonstrated the degradation of two organophosphorus pesticides, Paraoxon and Fenitrothion, occurred more efficiently in ILs and BBS as reaction media than in organic solvents or aqueous solution. The degradation of both pesticides is enhanced in terms of velocity and the products obtained in this reaction. The Paraoxon degradation is obtained with efficiency, yielding phosphate products that are less lipophilic and therefore less toxic to humans. On the other hand for extraction processes, the removal of Cu(II) ions from aqueous solutions was reported [23]  using different hydrophobic imidazolium-based ionic liquids such as: 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium hexafluorophosphate [bmim]PF6 , 1-hexyl-3-methyl-imidazolium hexafluorophosphate [hmim]PF6  and 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide [bmim]NTf2  and 1,1,1-trifluoro-2,4-pentanedione (TFA) as extractant. Solutions containing Cu(II) ions were contacted with [bmim]PF6 , [hmim]PF6  and [bmim]NTf2  in presence of TFA. After liquid–liquid extraction, both phases were analysed, verifying the formation of the neutral complex Cu(TFA)2  as the predominant extraction mechanism in [bmim]PF6  and [bmim]NTf2 . Meanwhile, the extraction of Cu(II) in [bmim]PF6  was strongly influenced by the direct interaction between the metal ion and the IL. The ionic liquids were regenerated using supercritical CO2  at 18 MPa and 40 °C. The ionic liquid [bmim]NTf2  showed the highest accumulative extraction percentage (≈80%) after sequential loads of Cu(II) ions. Afterwards the recovery performance in [bmim]NTf2  and TFA as extractant was improved [13] . A modified procedure was proposed, which showed better L–L extraction percentages with a decreasing of the concentration of TFA. This configuration allowed obtaining a stripping percentage higher than that obtained with a previously tested procedure in batch mode with a consumption of CO2  4.3 times lower than the observed one in Ref. [9] . Also, the recovery of Molybdenum (VI), other important metal for the Chilean economy, from aqueous solution by solvent extraction method (SX) was achieved [24] , using two hydrophobic ILs: [bmim]PF6  and 1-octyl-3-methyl-imidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [omim]NTf2 , In this study, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D2 EHPA) was used as the extractant. The use of the selected ILs as solvents involved higher extraction percentages for the entire measured range of extractant concentration and aqueous-organic ratios, decreasing four times the required volume of diluent compared to the experiments performed with kerosene. On the other hand, separation of Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol (ABE) mixtures, which are used to produce biobutanol [25] , from aqueous solution was proposed by sweep gas pervaporation using gelled supported ionic liquid membranes and by membrane evaporation [26] . IL membranes were found to have a great potential for separation of butanol from the ABE mixtures by pervaporation [27] . Since carbon dioxide has an important impact in the global warming and its anthropogenic emission has been sharply increasing in the last century, energetically favourable transformation of carbon dioxide into useful products represents a social and scientific need that must be solved [28] . It is well known that Chile is not a main contributor to the global warming, however what its less known is that Chile is probably one of the most threatened countries in the world because of this climate disruption. Indeed, the impact of this phenomenon is already being felt in the decrease of experienced rainfall, being partly responsible for a situation that is defined as mega-drought between the regions of Coquimbo and Araucanía [2,29] . In this context, different catalysts for carbon dioxide utilization have been designed, such as metal nanoparticles [30] , organic reagents [31]  and macrocyclic complexes [32] . Ionic liquids as solvents for carbon dioxide reduction have been intensively studied worldwide [33–35] , since the wide electrochemical window and higher solubility of CO2  in these solvents make them a good option when greener processes are needed. Quezada et al. in 2014 reported [36]  the electro-catalytic reduction of carbon dioxide using cobalt 5,10,15,20 tetrakis(4- aminophenyl)porphyrin forming a conducting polymer on an indium tin oxide electrode (ITO), using 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate [bmim]BF4  as reaction medium. This was the first example of reduction of carbon dioxide in ILs using a modified cathodic surface finding carbon monoxide as main reaction product at −0.8 V vs Ag/AgCl. Spectroelectrochemical evidence suggested that the reactive species promoting the reaction is an electrochemically generated Co(I) porphyrin. The same authors reported the preparation of zinc (II) and iron (III) poly tetra-amino-phenyl porphyrins on (ITO) in [bmim]BF4 [37] . The authors compared the activity of Fe and Zn modified surfaces, with only the former having considerable activity for carbon monoxide production. Spectroelectrochemical experiments shown intermediary species like Fe–CO2  and Fe–CO at open-circuit potential, indicating CO may be poisoning the surface. Overall, iron-porphyrin conducting polymers have showed a turnover number of 9.18, while the Zn film shows a value of 2.74; both being outperformed by the cobalt complex, which showed a TON of 69. Solutions of macrocyclic complexes in ionic liquids were later reported by Honores et al., in 2017 [38] . In their work, the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide using [Mn+ (cyclam)Cln ] (M = Ni2+  and Co3+ ) as electrocatalysts was studied in [bmim]BF4  and [bmim]NTf2 . Results indicated that both complexes in [bmim]BF4  present faster M(II)/M(I) redox processes, despite its higher viscosity when compared to [bmim]NTf2 . Electrochemical experiments demonstrated that [Ni(cyclam)Cl2 ] is the most active macrocycle towards the reaction under survey, potential controlled electrolysis carried out at −1.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl in [bmim]BF4  yielded only CO as a reaction product, with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.73 h−1 . FT-IR thin layer spectroelectrochemical experiments in CO2  saturated solution in [bmim]BF4  show the formation of [Ni(cyclam)CO]+  as a precursor species, and also the most stable [Ni(CO)4 ]. Theoretical approaches to carbon dioxide activation were designed by Gallardo et al., in their report on the mechanism of CO2  electro-cycloaddition to propylene oxide [39] . The study considered the analysis of mild and sustainable conditions to obtain cyclic carbonates from carbon dioxide. Within the electrochemical approach, the application of an overpotential in the reaction enhances the reaction yield significantly with respect to the thermal pathway. The quantum-mechanical approach provided relevant information about the reaction mechanism. Specifically, the use of the Lewis acid catalyst Mg2+  in the presence of the [bmim]Br IL presented the best condition for the electro-synthesis. In of terms energy, Chile has committed to change its electrical system from thermoelectric to 20% renewable by 2025, where photovoltaics presents one of the most promising opportunities in the world. Indeed, Chile and the associated industrial sector have invested and installed photovoltaics generation plants in the Atacama Desert with a growth from 11 Mw installed in 2014 to 800 Mw at the end of 2016; at present there are under construction or in contract a capacity of 13.3 GW [40] . This scenario pressures for new and sustainable materials with enhanced photo-electrical properties avoiding the use of precious metals, intensive extraction metals or semiconductors. Materials such as kesterite and calcopyrites have been prepared and tested as new sustainable absorbers for solar cells where the work of Henriquez [41]  and Galdamez [42]  is pioneering. Conclusions Several strategies for more sustainable processes were discussed. The replacement of petroleum-derived solvents is reflected in the decontamination of toxic compounds such as organophosphorus pesticides and in extraction processes of metals such as Cu and Mo. On the other hand, the reduction of CO2  in greener solvents has been demonstrated. Also, some advances in solar cells with sustainable materials were mentioned. These academic efforts are in order with new policies in Chile that aim for sustainable development. It is hoped that these efforts will be realized in the coming years.
