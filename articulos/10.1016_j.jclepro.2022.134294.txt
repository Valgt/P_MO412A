                  As the major consumer of resources and energy, the construction industry has been at the heart of the debate on sustainable development. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide the overarching guidance for the construction industry to promote sustainable development from environmental, social, and economic dimensions. Moreover, sustainable consumption and production (SCP) are highlighted in the SDG 12, while Sustainable Procurement (SP) focuses on promoting sustainable development through procurement processes and decisions. However, little has been written about how the construction industry could turn the challenges of SP into opportunities that promotes procurement practices in accordance with national policies and priorities. This study examines the drivers and challenges on the adoption of sustainable procurement in construction and how it impacts the achievement of SDG 12. The quantitative approach using questionnaires identified the drivers and barriers to SP implementation in construction and the SP practices contributing to the realisation of SDG 12 (Responsible consumption and production). The results confirmed that the construction industry should play a significant role in achieving the SDGs and show that construction SP practices contribute to the realisation of 9 of the SDG 12 targets. The results also suggested that governments should play a more active role in partnership with industry stakeholders and that the social and economic dimensions of sustainability deserve more attention. The value of this study is to provide construction industry stakeholder an insight into the drivers and challenges of SP and how to turn SP challenges into opportunities by adopting initiatives that consider the environmental, social, and economic impact of all procurement decisions. It also highlights the important role of the construction industry towards the realisation of the SDGs, particularly the significance of SP practices in the construction industry to the achievement of SDG 12.

Handling Editor: Prof. Jiri Jaromir Klemeš As the major consumer of resources and energy, the construction industry has been at the heart of the debate on sustainable development. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide the overarching guidance for the construction industry to promote sustainable development from environmental, social, and economic dimensions. Moreover, sustainable consumption and production (SCP) are highlighted in the SDG 12, while Sustainable Procurement (SP) focuses on promoting sustainable development through procurement processes and decisions. However, little has been written about how the construction industry could turn the challenges of SP into opportunities that promotes procurement practices in accordance with national policies and priorities. This study examines the drivers and challenges on the adoption of sustainable procurement in construction and how it impacts the achievement of SDG 12. The quantitative approach using questionnaires identified the drivers and barriers to SP implementation in construction and the SP practices contributing to the realisation of SDG 12 (Responsible consumption and production). The results confirmed that the construction industry should play a significant role in achieving the SDGs and show that construction SP practices contribute to the realisation of 9 of the SDG 12 targets. The results also suggested that governments should play a more active role in partnership with industry stakeholders and that the social and economic dimensions of sustainability deserve more attention. The value of this study is to provide construction industry stakeholder an insight into the drivers and challenges of SP and how to turn SP challenges into opportunities by adopting initiatives that consider the environmental, social, and economic impact of all procurement decisions. It also highlights the important role of the construction industry towards the realisation of the SDGs, particularly the significance of SP practices in the construction industry to the achievement of SDG 12.

After decades, the United Nations (UN) set a milestone for the world's sustainable development in 2015. The UN's report Transforming our World: The 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development  consists of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), 169 targets with 231 unique indicators, called “a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity” (UN, 2015 ). The UN measures the progress of the SDGs by focusing on the “5 Ps” of “people, planet, prosperity, peace, and partnerships” (Jayasooria, 2016 ). Thus, the realisation of the SDGs should be the responsibility of all sectors of every nation, state, and governments (Jayasooria, 2016 ). The construction industry should take significant responsibility in contributing to the promotion of sustainable development (Alawneh et al., 2018 ). The construction and building sector accounts for 5–10%of employment and creates 5–15% GDP (UNEP, 2018 ). However, the construction activities considerably lead to the emission of greenhouse gas. For example, steel, cement, paper, plastic, and aluminium creates 55% of CO2  worldwide (Allwood, 2012 ). Furthermore, the construction sector is responsible for 40% of the energy consumed, 40% of solid waste, 12% of water use and almost 30% of greenhouse gas emissions in the world (UNEP, 2018 ; Alawneh et al., 2018 ). It is a significant contributor to economic growth and a primary consumer of energy and natural resources, primarily non-renewable and non-sustainable resources (Khan et al., 2018 ; Alawneh et al., 2019 ). Besides, the construction industry has historically recorded poor performance in human health and safety; it accounts for approximately 20–30% of all reported vocational severe injuries and 40% of occupational cancer mortalities and cancer registrations (Shields, 2015 ; Ruparathna and Hewage, 2015 ; Edet, 2018 ). Consequently, the built environment significantly impacts three critical aspects of sustainable development: social, environmental and economic (Alawneh et al., 2019 ). As mentioned above, the construction industry is related to many serious global issues, such as climate change, resource scarcity, water, and resource use (UNEP, 2018 ; Alawneh et al., 2018 ). From 2010 to 2017, the use of non-metallic minerals went from 34.3% to 40.4% globally, accounting for almost half of all raw material use, indicating the considerable growth in infrastructure and construction (UN, 2020 ). In the construction industry, procurement is the process of acquiring materials and services during the entire lifecycle of construction projects, which increasingly impacts the achievement of the SDGs (Yu et al., 2020 ). The construction industry should take the primary role in waste prevention by reducing, recycling, and reusing resources (WGBC, 2016 ). However, traditional procurement in construction mainly focuses on the rule that the lowest price wins while ignoring the construction activities' influence on society and the environment (Opoku, 2013 ). On the social aspect, buildings provide a place for people to live and conduct a social life. However, various social issues remain prominent, such as unequal treatment of workers, lack of gender and ethnic diversity, and low working environment standards (Worrall et al., 2010 ). SP in construction aims to create social and economic benefits for project stakeholders and minimise environmental damage, which is a process through which project stakeholders can meet design and development needs while realising value for money throughout the project lifecycle (Alkilani and Jupp, 2012 ). Furthermore, SDG 12, which is “to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns” (UN, 2015 ) aims to focus on achieving energy and resource efficiency, developing sustainable infrastructure, and providing essential services and green jobs (WGBC, 2016 ). And SDG 12 target 12.7 is about Sustainable Public Procurement (SPP) promotion (UN, 2015 ). Public procurement is considered a huge contributor to the GDP of many countries (Chiarini et al., 2017 ). There is no doubt that the public sector is taking the primary responsibility in the rise of SP by the selection of stakeholders inside the supply chain in construction, while the private sector adopts SP practices because of the economic and financial benefits for their organisations (Agbesi et al., 2018 ; Chiarini et al., 2017 ). With increasing environmental concerns and resource exhaustion, there is an urgent need for the joint effort of both public and private sectors to apply SP effectively and this may have a more significant impact on developing countries than developed countries (Geng and Doberstein, 2008 ). The UNEP (2018)  argues that the current global consumption and production patterns are impossible to sustain, and that the planet will need 183 billion tonnes of material every year by 2050 if this pattern doesn't change. The adoption of sustainable procurement practices in construction industry for the acquisition of product and services to minimise the negative impact using green initiatives in the construction supply chain should be promoted (Willar et al., 2021 ). The adoption of SP in construction can help achieve the SDGs and address environmental, economic, and social issues by producing and purchasing environmentally friendly services and products. The construction industry is natural resource-intensive and therefore has an urgent role to play in the realisation of SDG 12 which underpins almost all the other SDGs from SDG 1 (Zero Poverty) to SDG 16 (Peace and Justice). However, little empirical research has been written on how the industry can address the challenge of resource use by adopting sustainable procurement practices towards the realisation of SDG 12. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to examine the drivers and challenges in the adoption of sustainable procurement in construction industry and how it impacts the achievement of SDG 12. The next section provides a review of relevant literature, followed by a description of the adopted research methodology in section 3 . Section 4  presents results and analysis followed by discussion in section 5  and conclusions in section 6 .  2 Literature review 2.1 The SDGs and the construction industry Considering the construction industry's impact on the environment, society, and economy, many researchers started to explore the construction industry's role in realising the SDGs since the publication of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development in 2015. By evaluating the relationship between water efficiency, and energy and atmosphere (EA) of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system and the SDGs, Alawneh et al. (2018)  discovered that these two categories play a positive role in the realisation of the SDGs 6, 9, 12, 13 and 15. It suggested that green buildings' water and energy efficiency significantly contribute to those SDGs. Focusing on the realisation of 8 of the 17 SDGs (4, 6, 7–9, 11, 15, 17), suggestions for designers to integrate the SDGs into sustainable building design by developing two mapping tools in sustainable building projects to trace the design process were provided by Goubran and Cucuzzella (2019) . Notably, considering building features, a comprehensive list of how building design can meet each SDG, which would be valuable and inspiring for future sustainable development, were also created (Goubran and Cucuzzella, 2019 ). Meanwhile, Alawneh et al. (2019)  provided an advanced framework to assess the integration of selected SDGs (3, 6, 7–9, 11–13, 15) into the project lifecycle. Furthermore, Goubran (2019)  found that 17% of the SDGs were directly related to activities in the construction sector and 27% indirectly, and the achievement of SDGs 11, 6 and 7 were most reliant on construction activities. Construction activities have damaged the balance of the ecosystem and biodiversity due to the fast pace of urbanisation, however, green infrastructure delivery, and the integration of biodiversity into property evaluation and management are very important towards the realisation of SDG 15 (Opoku, 2019 ). Economic sustainability advocates that construction activities are not wasteful and achieves economic growth with limited resources and minimal environmental harm (Baumgärtner and Quaas, 2010 ). Capital costs are always the main barrier to implementing sustainable construction practices. Social sustainability is about the social responsibility of construction organisations (Almahmoud and Doloi, 2015 ). It is not only associated with the social impact of the construction activities on the community but also, with the construction organisations' interaction with all stakeholders through the whole project lifecycle, such as the moral and ethical obligations with suppliers and workforce (Valdes-Vasquez and Klotz Leidy, 2013 ). Although sustainability has attracted attention in the construction industry for many years, academic literature exploring the industry's role in supporting the realisation of the SDGs is attracting increasing attention. Several studies have provided general recommendations for sustainable practices or tools for organisations to implement the SDGs, focusing on which goals take priority. The adoption of sustainable procurement practices in the construction industry faces several challenges that must be addressed to ensure successful sustainable project delivery that can impact on the realisation of the sustainable development goals (Vassen, 2021 ).  2.2 SDG 12 and sustainable procurement The SDG 12 is to “Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns” (UN, 2015 ) and comprises 11 targets and 13 indicators. Target 12.1–12.8 are specific targets, and targets 12.a – 12.c is about implementation practices both for developed and developing countries (Table 1  ). The SDG 12 looked at sustainability primarily from the perspective of production efficiency, addressing natural resources usage and management (Target 12.2), food production and reduction of food waste (Target 12.3), responsible chemicals and waste management (Target 12.4), reducing waste generation (Target 12.5), sustainable commercial practices and reporting (Target 12.6) and sustainable public Procurement (Target 12.7) (Gasper et al., 2019 ). SDG 12 emphasised technological innovation and corporation between developed countries and developing countries, such as Target 12.1 and Target 12.a, resource efficiency (Target 12.2), and cleaner production (Target 12.3, 12.4, 12.5 and 12.c), to minimise environmental and social impacts while ensuring economic growth (Gasper et al., 2019 ). The UK Sustainable Procurement Task Force defined Sustainable Procurement (SP) as “a process whereby organisations meet their needs for goods, services, works and utilities in a way that achieves value for money on a whole life basis in terms of generating benefits not only to the organisation, but also society and the economy, whilst minimising damage to the environment” (Defra, 2006 ). This definition was recognised by the United Nations (UN) in 2008 and ISO26000 and BS8903 are two well-accepted standards worldwide that guided SP (Iles and Ryall, 2016 ). UN (2008) argued that there existed a difference between the terms Green Public Procurement (GPP) and Sustainable Public Procurement (SPP). The former concentrated on acquiring products and services that minimise environmental impact, while the latter took not only environmental consideration but also included social consideration, such as “gender and ethnics equity; poverty eradication and respect for core labour standards”. GPP has proved to be evolving towards SPP over the years (Uttam et al., 2014 ). Different countries might use different terms to describe SP, but in the end, their policy contents seek to address the three aspects of sustainability (social, environmental and social) (Uttam et al., 2014 ). Accordingly, there is no distinction between the meaning of Sustainable Procurement (SP) and Green Procurement (GP) in this paper and the term is used interchangeably. 2.2.1 Current sustainable procurement practices With the increasing concern on sustainable development worldwide, the number of research on SP has increased in the last few years. On one hand, some studies have tended to investigate the development of SP/GP in particular countries, such as Sweden, the United Kingdom, Germany, the United States, Denmark, China, Malaysia and Pakistan (Faith-Ell et al., 2006 ; Walker and Brammer, 2009 ; Large and Gimenez Thomsen, 2011 ; Fuguo et al., 2012 ; Mcmurray et al., 2014 ; Roman, 2017 ; Zaidi et al., 2019 ; Kannan, 2021 ). On the other hand, some studies made comparisons of SP practices in different countries. For example, Walker and Brammer (2012)  investigated the association between e-procurement and SP in 20 countries. Chiarini et al. (2017)  compared SP practices of the public health sector between the UK and Italy. Wang et al. (2018)  explored developed countries' SP practices promoting technological innovation. In terms of barriers to SP implementation, the lack of awareness and resources and insufficient knowledge are common in both developed and developing countries (Walker and Brammer, 2009 ; Zhu et al., 2013 ; Mcmurray et al., 2014 ; Zaidi et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, the drivers of the implementation of SP include legislation, top management commitment, government policy (Mcmurray et al., 2014 ; Kannan, 2021 ; Fuguo et al., 2012 ; Large and Gimenez Thomsen, 2011 ). In terms of SP practices, adopting energy-saving and environmentally friendly products, supporting SMEs' development, procuring domestic products, and promoting high-tech products and services were common SP practices (Wang et al., 2018 ; Walker and Phillips, 2009 ). Social sustainability of SP policies, such as working conditions, safety, equity, and human rights, have also been adopted (Islam et al., 2017 ; Mcmurray et al., 2014 ). However, the findings of some studies revealed that the development of SP in developing countries was still a long distance from that of developed countries. For instance, in recent years, GPP usually accounted for 10%–20% of government procurement, while the rate of GPP in Germany, Denmark, and Sweden range from 20% to 40% and the figure of Finland has reached over 80% (Renda et al., 2012 ; Liu et al., 2019 ). The decentralised nature of the Chinese government has led to the limited competence of government procurement departments, which has also hindered the development of GP (Fuguo et al., 2012 ). Besides, local, and religious cultures might also be the barriers to the SP implementation among some Asian countries (Mcmurray et al., 2014 ; Islam et al., 2017 ).  2.2.2 SDG 12 and sustainable procurement in the construction industry As SDG12 is still a relatively a new topic, there is still minimal academic discussion in the context of the construction industry. Therefore, the following analysis focused on the literature on sustainable practices towards the achievement of SDG 12. Several studies identified the drivers and barriers to SP implementation in the construction industry, as presented in Tables 2 and 3   . Results of Iles and Ryall (2016)  study showed that cost was the main barrier, and this view was from those companies that did not implement SP, while those companies that have implemented SP recognised that SP was cost-saving. Eliminating inertia and improving knowledge deficiency are two approaches for promoting organisations’ SP implementation (Iles and Ryall, 2016 ; Belfitt et al., 2011 ). Shen et al. (2017)  found that Chinese developers are market-driven, and the Chinese government played a minor impact in promoting GP practices than governments of developed countries, indicating that current policy has not put enough pressure and initiatives for developers to adopt GP. Ruparathna and Hewage (2015)  identified that insufficient investment was the main challenge for SP implementation in the Canadian context. Agbesi et al. (2018)  also built a conceptual model to evaluate technical, organisational, and environmental factors for initiating and implementing SP. According to BS ISO 10845 (2021), the construction procurement process involve planning, acquiring, and managing contracts relating to “the delivery and the maintenance of construction works”. Resource and energy efficiency, waste minimisation and management, and innovation are factors or activities in sustainable construction procurement. Several researchers provided sustainable solutions for procurement-related activities through technological innovation in the pre-construction and construction phases (Table 4  ). Wimalasena and Gunatilake (2018)  suggested that e-procurement is more time and cost-efficient than traditional procurement processes. Although many applications for e-procurement have already been developed, such as e-catalogues, e-ordering, e-sourcing, e-tendering, there is not yet a system that can include all procurement activities through the project lifecycle (Laryea and Ibem, 2014 ). Yu et al. (2020)  developed an innovative conceptual framework for integrating e-procurement into SP in construction projects. Vinokurov et al. (2019)  developed a list of energy efficiency factors for procurement, including indoor climate quality, energy use and environmental impact and the life cycle economy, contributing to the transparent and effective sustainable building design. Furthermore, Azzi et al. (2015)  highly recommended the application of low-emission technology and low-carbon production technology in construction should be accelerated because of the energy-intensive nature of the industry. It is widely accepted that the integration of Building Information Modelling (BIM) into sustainable design contributes to the realisation of energy efficiency and sustainability in the whole project lifecycle (Azzi et al., 2015 ; Eleftheriadis et al., 2017 ; Ajayi and Oyedele, 2017 ). Researchers have become increasingly interested in the issues of waste generation and waste management. Practices include logistics management, material reuse, waste segregation, Construction and Demolition Waste (CDW) recycling and, in particular, recycled aggregate concrete have proven its value in achieving resource efficiency and carbon reduction (Ajayi et al., 2017 ; Gálvez-Martos et al., 2018 ; Islam et al., 2019 ). Ajayi and Oyedele (2017)  stated that the primary drivers of waste minimisation are legislation and fiscal policies. Relating to economic and social sustainability, the Whole Life Costing (WLC) approach was used to evaluate the financial performance throughout the project lifecycle, which was also a powerful technique for SP (Opoku, 2013 ). Nevertheless, only 5% of the private sector took the WLC approach (Belfitt et al., 2011 ). Russell et al. (2018)  also stated that the guidance of SDG 12 on economic activities was limited as its indicators focused on the process instead of the outcome. It was again suggested that it was essential to have a third party test and evaluate the implementation of SDG12, as their third-party perspective and certification brought transparency (Russell et al., 2018 ). Opoku and Fortune (2015)  recommended that local suppliers and contractors’ adoption was essential regarding social sustainability. Moreover, Opoku and Guthrie (2018)  found that the housing sector has not emphasised social value to realise value for money (VFM) in the procurement process. The research results showed that vocational skills training, crime and anti-social behaviour mitigation, job creation, are required at the top of the list for businesses to deliver social value.    3 Research methodology A quantitative research method and the survey strategy were adopted to collect primary data through the administration of questionnaires among the construction industry professionals in Guangdong Province of China. The purpose was to examine factors relevant to the construction industry's role in achieving the SDGs by identifying the drivers and the challenges of SP. Furthermore, China is the biggest producer and consumer of construction materials globally (Shen et al., 2017 ). Thus, the research in China's construction industry could be a typical reference for the construction industry worldwide. Despite the extensive literature review to evaluate the role of the construction industry in the realisation of the SDGs and the role of the SP in construction in support of the SDG 12, it is not formative enough. Therefore, a snowballing sampling technique was used in administering the questionnaires until a sample size of 120 construction industry professionals was achieved using the Chinese “WeChat” online platform. It is believed that snowball sampling could be biased, however Morgan (2008)  argues that the best defence against weaknesses of snowballing sample is to begin with a set of initial respondents that are as diverse as possible. Chan (2020)  argues that even though the snowball samples are subject to sample selection bias, the information about the network connections is not. It is also recommended that, by increasing the sample size for an online survey, the bias could be reduced (Kirchherr and Charles, 2018 ). Again, the target population and sampling frame was clearly defined to reduce bias and demonstrate if the sample represents the population (Illenberger et al., 2008 ). The study therefore adopted these measures to reduce bias and enhancing the sample diversity of the sample which is a good representative sample of the targeted population of construction industry professionals in Guangdong Province, China having the relevant knowledge and experience in construction procurement and the SDGs. The aim is to identify the role of the construction industry, key drivers and barriers to SP implementation, and effective SP practices/measures that contributes to the achievement of the SDG 12. Respondents were asked to rank their awareness of the SDGs and their perception of the role of the construction industry in achieving the SDGs on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not aware), to 5 (completely aware), and from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree) respectively. Again, respondents were required to assess their view on drivers of SP implementation, including 12 items from four dimensions, by using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree). Finally, respondents were then required to rate the significance of the seven barriers to SP implementation and the 15 SP practices that support the SDG 12. A five-point Likert scale was applied from 1 (the least significant) to 5 (the most significant). All items asked to be assessed were derived from the extensive literature review, presented in Tables 2–4 . The use of Likert scale allows respondents to indicate their opinion/attitudes on positive-to-negative strength of agreement of a statement. A 5-point Likert scale was used for this study because it is relatively easier for respondents to understand, ideal for a larger study and tends to produce better distributions of data (McLeod, 2019 ). The targeted respondents of this survey included professionals with experience in construction projects, working in organisations associated with the construction industry, such as real estate companies, design companies, and construction companies. Guangdong province was selected for the study since its current economic and social development state reflected that it must adopts sustainable development path in the infrastructure and real estate sector to maintain stable socio-economic growth. Guangdong's GDP has been ranked first in China for more than 30 years. Its urbanisation rate has continued to grow, reaching 74.15% in 2020 (Guangdong Bureau of Statistics, 2021 ), making it one of the most developed provinces in China. Nevertheless, at the same time, Guangdong is the most densely populated place in China (Textor, 2020 ). Secondly, with the rapid path of urbanisation, resource issues have become increasingly severe. Guangdong's energy resources are highly scarce, and its external dependence is high while facing water scarcity and pollution problems (Zhai et al., 2019 ). Its construction industry is highly dependent on internal forest resources (Zhang et al., 2018 ). In 2011, China's Development and Reform Commission approved seven pilot carbon trading schemes, which run from 2013 to 2015, of which Guangdong Province and Shenzhen are among the pilot provinces and cities (Deng et al., 2018 ; Zhang et al., 2020 ). Overall, considering Guangdong's economic, social and environment characteristics and its increasing demand on sustainable development, its construction industry is suitable for exploring the answers of this research. SPSS v27 was used to analyse the collected data of the questionnaire. The data were analysed by descriptive analysis of mean and standard deviation, parametric tests with one-sample t-tests and the Relative Importance Index (RII) analytical tools. Interval and ratio data may allow for parametric analysis, whilst nominal and ordinal data limit the analysis to non-parametric forms (Naoum, 2002 ). Also, parametric tests are much more flexible, and allow the testing of greater range of hypotheses than nonparametric test (Siegel and Castellan, 1988 ). Even though parametric data are assumed to be normally distributed, parametric tests can provide trustworthy results with distributions that are skewed and nonnormal and that parametric analyses can produce reliable results even when your continuous data are nonnormally distributed. The one-sample t -test can be used for statistical analysis provided the sample size is greater than 20 (Frost, 2022 ). Firstly, respondents' views of the relationship between the SDGs and the construction industry and drivers of SP implementation were analysed by descriptive analysis and then the one-sample t -test because the results can indicate the overall view of a normally distributed population (Johnson, 2009 ; Wong et al., 2016 ). Secondly, respondents’ perceptions of the significance of different barriers to SP implementation and different SP practices contributing to SDG 12 were analysed using RII, which was used to rank the significance of various items (Alawneh et al., 2019 ). The mean of the responses which were significantly above 3, were assumed to have a significant relationship between the assessed barriers and SP implementation or a significant relationship between the assessed practices and SDG 12. RII could only be calculated if a significant relationship was found (Alawneh et al., 2019 ). Equation (1)  was used to calculate each assessment item (Alawneh et al., 2019 ; Iwaro et al., 2014 ). A higher RII value means that the barrier has a more significant impact on SP implementation or that the SP practice contributes more to SDG 12.(1) R I I = ∑ i = 1  n  W i   A N       where W = weighting of each item provided by respondents (ranging from 1 to 5), A = the highest weight, and N = total number of respondents in the sample. Relative Importance Index (RII) analysis was adopted because it is appropriate for indicators rated on Likert scale and helps with the ranking of the most important criteria based on responses from the research participants. The RII analysis turns the results of a five-point Likert scale into a format that makes ranking of all the indicators easier (McLeod, 2019 ). Before these analyses, the reliability of various items was pre-tested by the Cronbach's alpha test. The acceptable level of the test is 0.7 and above. (Islam et al., 2017 ). The test result of this survey was 0.955, which was higher than 0.70, indicating that the measurement instrument has high internal consistency.  4 Results and analysis A total of 83 out of 120 questionnaires were responded to and retrieved for further analyses representing 69% response rate. This section presents an analysis of the demographic background of respondents, Awareness and understanding of the SDGs and the construction industry, Drivers of SP implementation, and Barriers to SP implementation; SP practices contribute to the realisation of the SDGs. 4.1 Demographic background The analysis of demographics of participants (Table 5  ) for the research shows that, over half of the respondents were from organisations within the construction industry, including real estate companies (10.84%), construction companies (14.46%), design companies (20.48%), and consulting organisations (12.05%). Other respondents were working in organisations related to the construction industry, including financial institutions (3.61%), technology enterprises (7.23%), universities/research institutions (10.84%), governments (3.61%). Respondents held different positions or roles in their respective organisations, with senior positions such as procurement department managers and project managers accounting for 16.87% and 9.64%, respectively, while budget specialists, senior engineers and architects accounted for 22.89%, 8.43% and 3.61%, respectively. More than half of the respondents had more than ten years of work experience. All the information suggests that the data are reliable and meaningful for the study.  4.2 Understanding of the SDGs and the construction industry The respondents were asked about their opinion on the contribution of the construction industry to the realisation of the SDGs. The results of the respondents' views on the role of the construction industry in realising the SDGs are presented in Fig. 1   and Table 6  . Fig. 1  shows that most respondents agreed that the construction industry can contribute to the realisation of the UN sustainable development goals. The results shows a mean score of 4.386 with a t-value of 4.12 and a p-value of 0.000 < 0.05, showing that the mean value is statistically significantly different from “4 = agree”. Both results of Fig. 1  and Table 6  indicate that the respondents have a high degree of agreement that the construction industry can greatly impact on the realisations of the SDGs.  4.3 Drivers of SP implementation Table 7   summarises the analysis of drivers of SP implementation in political, environmental, social, and economic dimensions. 4.3.1 Political drivers Regarding the political aspect, both Mean values are higher than 4 with their p-value < 0.05. The results show that both “government policy” and “regulation and legislation” play an essential role in motivating the development of SP. Besides, Cronbach's alpha test score under this category was 0.846, showing good internal consistency between the items. The Mean value of “government policy” is slightly higher than “regulation and legislation”, indicating that the government policy's role is more favourable than regulation and legislation. The government is an important customer for the construction industry. Furthermore, regulation and legislation directly influence companies' purchasing decisions of construction materials, resources, and services. Literature also suggested that organisations take environmental, social, and economic sustainability into consideration when formulating construction contracts in the early stages of the project (Belfitt et al., 2011 ).  4.3.2 Environmental drivers The results in Table 7  clearly shows that respondents consider environmental drivers as the most important, as the average score for this question was 4.33, the highest score of the four-dimensional drivers. This finding also reflects that those environmental issues caused by the industry have gained attention. It is also worth noting that there is not much difference between the agreement ratings for the different environmental drivers, suggesting that each item under this category is essential. Besides, Cronbach's alpha test score under this category was 0.940, showing good internal consistency between the objects. “Waste management” was found to be the strongest motivator for SP implementation, with a Mean value of 4.41 (p-value < 0.05). Evidence showed that the construction industry generates a significant proportion of the total waste in many countries. The figures recorded in the literature revealed the waste production quota for China (40%), the UK (44%), Brazil (40%), Australia (44%), and Canada (27%) (Oyedele et al., 2014 ; Jin et al., 2017 ; Ajayi and Oyedele, 2017 ). The CDW mainly consisted of concrete, ceramic materials, mortar, masonry, and packaging materials such as paper, plastic, and wood (Gálvez-Martos et al., 2018 ; Zhao et al., 2010 ) accounted for about 30–35% of the costs of construction activities Hussin et al. (2013) . However, landfilling remains the leading practice for disposing of CDW (Ajayi and Oyedele, 2017 ). Proper waste management could reduce the negative impact of construction activities on the environment and create better economic benefits. “Pollution reduction” and “resource management” are the other two key drivers, with a Mean value of 4.39 (p-value < 0.05) and 4.34 (p-value < 0.05), respectively. “Forest management” [Mean value = 4.18; p-value > 0.05] received less attention compared to other drivers. Timber harvesting for construction activities has contributed to the loss of natural forests even though the industry requires resources, such as steel and cement, which generate pollutants and greenhouse gases (Azzi et al., 2015 ). The selection of more efficient materials and products to meet the environmental requirements at the design stage would lead to pollution reduction and better resource management, creating environmental benefits.  4.3.3 Social drivers Compared to other aspects of SP drivers, respondents gave the lowest average Mean rating to social drivers as4.04, showing that respondents might lack awareness and understanding of the relationship between social drivers and the concept of SP or what social benefits SP could bring. The Cronbach's alpha test under this category was 0.743, confirming the internal consistency between the social enablers of SP. The social driver “community and employee's health and safety's standard” received the highest rating on average [mean value = 4.18; p-value = 0.028 < 0.05]. The quality of life of both community members and employees should not be overlooked. “Equitable access and the sustainability of the community itself” are two critical dimensions of social sustainability (Dempsey et al., 2011 ). From the context of the construction industry, there is the need to consider respect for employees, cooperation, and the impact of construction activities on the local communities, whiles containing the rule that provides a healthy and ambient working environment for the workers in the SP, which can minimise the probability of accidents (Opoku and Ahmed, 2014 ). Furthermore, improving air quality by reducing toxic materials will enhance efficiency and provide a comfortable living environment (Khan et al., 2018 ). The building environment and its operation, on the other hand, play an essential role in the sense of security for people (Dempsey et al., 2011 ). The mean values for “organisation culture” [mean value = 4.05; p = 0.596 > 0.05] and “reputation” [mean value = 3.90; p = 0.313 > 0.05], were relatively low among the drivers of SP. The results reflected that social sustainability was yet to be appreciated in the organisational culture. Agbesi et al. (2018)  suggested that organisational culture would affect the adoption of SP. Organisational culture is an important force shaping employee awareness and motivating SP practices (Agbesi et al., 2018 ). Belfitt et al. (2011)  suggested that reputation is a vehicle for contractors to meet the environmental and social requirements within the supply chain. The survey findings revealed that sustainability was still not a fundamental performance that clients and consumers considered when selecting contractors.  4.3.4 Economic drivers Numerous researchers have revealed the initial cost of adopting sustainable construction practices to be high. Nonetheless, considering the total costs from the perspective of the lifecycle of construction projects, SP can save the operation and maintenance costs of buildings (Iles and Ryall, 2016 ). The economic drivers of SP, however, should not be overlooked. Among three economic drivers, “cost-effectiveness” [mean value = 4.22; p = 0.012 < 0.05] received the highest score, which is consistent with the findings of Iles and Ryall (2016) . Also, the result of the Cronbach's alpha test of 0.819 confirmed the internal consistency among the items under this category. SP emphasised Value for Money (VFM), which could motivate project stakeholders to purchase more efficiently by selecting renewable and sustainable materials, and green equipment (Khan et al., 2018 ). Again, market differentiation was a great enabler for organisations to transform their strategies and practices (Belfitt et al., 2011 ). Companies with experience in SP practices could have a competitive advantage when introducing sustainable procurement and tendering criteria. Under this circumstance, private clients and the government played an essential role in the market as regulators. The survey results revealed that while companies recognised that cost-effectiveness was an advantage, companies were yet to see obvious business benefits that would motivate them to implement SP, further demonstrating that competitive pressures were yet to be developed.   4.4 Barriers to SP implementation Table 8   presents respondents' perceptions on the significant barriers to the implementation of SP identified from the literature. The Relative Importance Index (RII) was calculated, and the importance and their respective rankings are presented. Also, the Cronbach's alpha test score was 0.867, showing good internal consistency under this category. The barrier “insufficient policies, regulations, incentives” [RII = 0.836] was perceived as the most significant barrier to implementing SP. This finding affirms the studies of Shen et al. (2017)  in China. The role of government in facilitating procurement practices is undoubtedly regarded as very important. For the construction sector, China introduced Civil Building Energy Conversation regulations  in 2008, but the procurement policy for green buildings and green building materials has just been piloted since 2020. Although sustainability criteria have been introduced into Chinese politics and law, SP is yet to become a legal concept in China's public procurement laws or other relevant laws as the Chinese SP was still in its infancy stage (Cao and Zhou, 2014 ). A lack of enforcement of the legislation and incentives is a considerable obstacle to promoting SP practices. “Lack of funding” [RII = 0.819] was perceived as the second most significant barrier. This result confirms the prejudice of industry practitioners against sustainable construction practices. Fearing high initial expenditures or additional costs or failing to understand the need for sustainability. Many practitioners, mainly those responsible for capital budgeting, prefer to take the lowest cost option and limit spending on sustainable construction in the procurement process (Sourani and Sohail, 2011 ). However, contractors who are SMEs pursue short-term benefits to survive in the market. This result again reinforces the conflict between SP from a long-term perspective and cost reduction, which has been discussed in the previous social driver section of this paper. “Lack of awareness, information, commitment and demand” [RII = 0.788], “lack of knowledge” [RII = 0.778], and “lack of guidance” [RII = 0.771], ranked 3rd, 4th,  and 5th respectively. The development of SP must be applied to local characteristics. However, it is challenging to build a comprehensive database and mechanism to measure sustainable criteria with local factors (Ruparathna and Hewage, 2015 ). There is lack of commitment from the sector towards the adoption of sustainable procurement. Thus, clear guidance, policy and regulations for construction that defines clear sustainable issues during the procurement stage is essential to develop SP practices. “Passive organisational culture” was perceived as the 6th significant barrier to SP implementation. The passive organisational culture results from change resistance within organisations. Sourani and Sohail (2011)  stated that resistance exists in clients, suppliers, and investors. Top management commitment, cost constraints and insufficient guidance influence clients’ decisions. The demand and willingness of clients directly influence the procurement within the supply chain. Investors are more concerned about the return on their investment rather than sustainable issues (Sourani and Sohail, 2011 ). “Poor technical capacity” was rated the 7th significant barrier. It is about the capacity to identify criteria for sustainability. This result suggested that the research and development of SP are inadequate, which may be the result of the insufficient investment of funds and resources.  4.5 Sustainable procurement practices contribution to the realisation of the SDGs In terms of the significance of sustainable procurement in construction towards the realisations of the SDG, the value of RII calculated (Table 9  ) shows that all the identified practices played a significant role in realising the SDG 12. Also, Cronbach's alpha test score was 0.935, showing good internal consistency under this category. The results show that the most effective SP practice to realise the SDG 12 is “material reuse” [RII of 0.867]. “Waste segregation” [RII = 0.846], “water conservation” [RII = 0.841] and “construction and demolition waste (CDW) recycling” [RII = 0.839], ranked 4th, 5th and 6th respectively. The results showed that most people recognise these as significant measures to achieve resource efficiency and the need for resource efficiency in construction activities. However, “logistics management” [RII = 0.790] ranked as the 9th important practice and “landfill tax and aggregate tax” [RII = 0.769] as the 12th out of 15 practices, indicating that there is currently insufficient legislation and policy, as well as incomplete regulatory measures and guidance. South Korea's recycling rate of CDW was about 98% in 2011, and Japan's was over 90% since 2008 (Akhtar and Sarmah, 2018 ). In recent years, the recycling rate in China has only been nearly 10% (Forward, 2020 ). Compared to China's two neighbours (South Korea and Japan), China's construction industry is still at a very early stage of waste management. Recycled aggregates from CDW can be applied to base materials for road construction, hardcore for foundation work, foundations/fills for drainage systems, aggregates for concrete manufacture and general bulk filling (Zhao et al., 2010 ). The ambition of SDG 12 to achieve resource efficiency required all stakeholders ought to work together from the beginning of the lifecycle and to develop waste management strategies for the reuse and recycling of materials and components (Osmani, 2012 ). “Sustainable design” [RII of 0.858] was rated the second significant procurement practice towards the realising of SDG 12. This revealed that the concept of sustainable design has become increasingly popular in the Chinese construction industry. Many architects and engineers believe that it can minimise environmental impact by delivering sustainable buildings (Azzi et al., 2015 ). The green roof is an excellent example of sustainable design, reducing building energy loss, reusing rainwater, and providing an ambient environment (Nguyen et al., 2019 ). “BIM” was perceived as the 8th significant practice (RII = 0.795). BIM is in the promotion phase in China and is not yet mandatory in construction projects. The integration of BIM not only enables sustainable design, taking into account sustainable issues such as materials used and energy performance during the design, construction and operation phases but also contributes to more effective construction project management such as cost management, resource management and quality management (Azzi et al., 2015 ). The 3rd significant practice is “fuel-efficient machinery, low-emission technology and low-carbon production technology” [RII of 0.855], while “e-procurement” was ranked last. This revealed that people ignored the importance of changing how they work in terms of technical innovation. Traditionally, transactions between stakeholders require a lot of paperwork, most of which becomes trash at the end of the project, except “vocational skills training”, “WLC approach”, “job creation”, “crime and anti-social behaviour mitigation” and “the adoption of local suppliers and contractors” ranked after 7th. This also revealed that people recognise the industry's impact on the environment but pay less attention to sustainable development's economic and social dimensions. Furthermore, people do not consider sustainable development from a long-term perspective when implementing SP measures in the construction industry.   5 Discussions The SDG targets and indicators provide a great opportunity for the sustainability journey of the construction sector. According to the UN, the SDG goal 12 matters for all businesses including construction businesses and that it’s in the interest of business organisation to find innovative solutions that will enable sustainable consumption and production Such strategies should identify key areas within the value chain where the implementation of any initiative could have the highest opportunity to improve the environmental and social impact of procurement activities (UN, 2016 ). . China's construction sector has the highest carbon emissions of any construction sector in the world (Huang et al., 2018 ). Total carbon emissions from the building lifecycle were 4.93 billion tons, constituting 51.3% of the country's carbon emissions in 2018 (Wang et al., 2018 ). Therefore, the construction industry in China should take the primary responsibility in achieving the sustainable development goals and carbon neutrality. The purpose of implementing SP is aligned with SDG 12, and the study first identified the drivers and barriers to implementing SP in the construction industry. It then clarified which SP practices in the construction industry can influence the realisation of SDG 12. In terms of drivers, the results showed that “government policy” and “regulation and legislation” were both essential. Political drivers, such as “waste management”, “community and employee's health and safety and standard”, and “cost-effectiveness” were the most critical environmental, social and economic drivers respectively. The social drivers were attached less importance compared to other drivers in general. This suggested that the implementation of SP in construction was being driven by government policies and regulations and a growing awareness of the economic and environmental benefits. The study findings showed that “insufficient policies, regulations, and incentives”, “lack of funding”, and “lack of awareness, information, commitment and demand” were the three most significant barriers to SP implementation, indicating that the obstacles were mainly external factors. In the open-ended question of other barriers to SP implementation, some respondents suggested that the conflict between enterprises existing benefits and sustainable development was also a barrier. This revealed that organisations currently do not receive sufficient legal and financial support from the government to implement the relevant sustainable procurement strategies, and there was a lack of incentives. In view of this, governments should adopt a more active role in promoting SP by exerting more mandatory and regulatory pressures on businesses and creating a positive business environment to drive demand. Regarding SP practices contribution to the realisation of SDG 12, “material reuse”, “sustainable design”, “fuel-efficient machinery, low-emission technology and low-carbon production technology”, “waste segregation” and “water conservation” were the top 5 significant sustainable criteria that should be considered in the SP process. These results revealed a similar indication to the drivers of SP implementation, that industry practitioners are more concerned about environmental issues than economic and social issues. In addition, the responses to the open-ended questions suggested that appropriate measurement mechanisms and tax relief for the companies involved were feasible. At the same time, it was also recommended that successful pilot projects could positively impact the business environment. It was also argued that the quality of personnel was crucial. These were suggested measures that could promote the development of SP practices in the construction industry. To break out barriers, governments should cooperate with industry stakeholders and developers to develop measurement mechanisms, policies and guidelines, which could be the reference and foundation for the adoption of SP. Based on the above analysis, the Chinese construction industry could implement several SP practices to promote the realisation of some targets of SDG 12. In the Chinese context, the adoption of material reuse, sustainable design, fuel-efficient machinery, low-emission technology, low-carbon production technology, waste segregation, and water conversation were practices associated with natural resource efficiency (Target 12.2). In addition to the chemicals and waste responsible management (Target 12.4), they are reducing waste generation (Target 12.5) and increasing technological capacity (Target 12. a). Meanwhile, governments should take the lead responsibility for providing legal and financial support, developing guidance, databases, and measurement mechanisms (Target 12.1, Target 12.7, Target 12.c) for organisations to better implement SP in the industry (Target 12.6) and raising awareness and understanding of sustainable development and lifestyles (12.8). In addition, lifecycle approaches (Target 12.4–12.6) and economic and social issues deserve more attention in promoting SDG 12. In general, identifying drivers, barriers to the SP implementation, and SP practices revealed that the industry practitioners should pay more attention to the social and economic criteria while promoting SP, and the roles of governments were very significant in promoting SP in construction. Furthermore, SP practices could support the realisation of several SDG 12 targets, including Target 12.1, 12.2, 12.4, 12.5, 12.6, 12.7, 12.8, 12.a and 12.c. The construction industry is known for its high material consumption, CO2 emissions and energy consumption. The industry must therefore take relevant approaches such as the adoption of sustainable procurement practices to contribute to the achievement of SDGs (Wieser et al., 2019 ).  6 Conclusions The UN SDGs are highly relevant to all humanity and the SDG 12 aims to improve the quality of life while increasing the benefits of economic activities by minimising resource consumption, environmental degradation, and pollution throughout the lifecycle of products and services. Whereas the construction industry was an essential player in supporting sustainable development, SP incorporated sustainability criteria into business activities, policies, and strategies. Given this, the study was undertaken to evaluate the construction industry's role in achieving the SDGs and the role of SP in achieving SDG 12 in the construction industry. More importantly, the study found that several SP practices in the construction sector were significant in achieving most of the SDG 12 targets, such as resource efficiency measures, sustainable design, the application of fuel-efficient machinery, low-emission, and low-carbon production technology. The findings of the study suggested that the promotion of the SDGs and SP in the Chinese construction industry was currently insufficient. The study also revealed that environmental sustainability gained more policy support than social and economic sustainability dues to the ease of measuring environmental sustainability measures. With governments increasing efforts on providing mandatory policies, legislations, regulations and advocation, organisations within the construction industry could change their conservative attitude and style of implementation of SP to promote sustainable development – the realisation of carbon neutrality and the SDG 12. Whiles other papers have been written on the driver/challenges of sustainable procurement, this paper contributes to knowledge-increasing in the field of sustainable procurement in construction and how it specifically connects with SDG 12 (Responsible consumption and production). Most research on sustainable procurement in construction examine the broader context of sustainable development goals but this paper is one of the few research papers that provides empirical research specifically on sustainable procurement and SDG 12 in the context of construction. The construction industry has struggled to satisfy the UN's sustainable development goals and targets with its resource-intensive nature. The construction sector's sustainable transformation of production and consumption standards is urgent and necessary. Therefore, this study is meaningful for both the academic community and the industry. This study contributed to the growing area of literature on the SDGs within the construction industry, with a particular focus on SDG 12. The analysis and summary of the literature on the SDGs and the construction industry present a comprehensive basis for the current state of exploring the SDGs and increasing understanding and awareness of the construction industry's role in achieving the SDGs. This study also enriched the academic literature on the realisation of specific SDGs by presenting insights into SP practices and exploring their relationship with SDG 12 targets. The analysis of the drivers and barriers to SP implementation provided valuable insights and references for the authorities concerned, associations and companies to introduce measures to overcome barriers, such as introducing mandatory policies, legislation, and regulation, providing subsidies, developing measurement mechanisms, and initiating pilot projects. Due to their ranking significance, the SP practices were also valuable criteria for clients to assess performance in the procurement process. By understanding the drivers and the challenges in the adopting of sustainable procurement practices, construction industry stakeholders can therefore adopt holistic approach in the practice of engaging in sustainable procurement processes. Finally, many construction organisations now view procurement as a strategic function aimed at achieving efficient and sustainable management of natural resources. The construction industry should promote sustainable procurement practices in accordance with national policies and priorities including the integration of sustainability performance into company financial reporting. The study's limitations stem from the location and target groups from which the information was collected. Firstly, the respondents were based in Guangdong province, one of the most developed provinces in China. Thus, the findings in this study could not represent the entire China and could not be generalised for all developing countries. Secondly, the diversity of respondents' backgrounds was insufficient, and the study lacked views from the government and suppliers who are important stakeholders of the supply chain in the industry. Future research could consider larger and more diverse sample of respondents, particularly a larger number of respondents from the government and the supply chain side. Further research should devote more effort to effective SP practices and a comprehensive database for assessing sustainable procurement performance. Current policies are primarily designed to mitigate environmental impacts but lacks enforcement. Moreover, there is a great need for further research that evaluates the effectiveness of various incentives and policies towards SP. The development of tools and frameworks to measure the effectiveness of SP practices and policies on promoting SDG 12 is also required.
