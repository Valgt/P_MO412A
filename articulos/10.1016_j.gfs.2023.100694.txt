The progress of developing SDG Indicator 2.4.1, such as defining the concept of sustainable agriculture and selecting sub-indicators, reflect the achievements towards sustainable agriculture and the contribution of existing studies. However, the challenges and limitations of developing SDG Indicator 2.4.1 reflect the some difficulties to achieve sustainable agriculture. This short perspective calls for future interdisciplinary and multi-dimensional research on sustainable agriculture.   Keywords SDG Indicator 2.4.1  Sustainable agriculture   Data availability No data was used for the research described in the article.   1 Introduction It has been identified that some major issues about sustainable agriculture such as biodiversity conservation, land tenure rights, and cross-country data gaps are under-studied (Bizier et al., 2022 ; Brunelli and Gourlay, 2022 ; Dorward and Giller, 2022 ). Nevertheless, substantial efforts are made to address these issues. An example is the development of SDG Indicator 2.4.1, under the custodianship of Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO). This indicator measures the ‘proportion of agricultural area under productive and sustainable agriculture’ (FAO, 2022 , p1), which is the main indicator under the framework of SDGs that monitors the progress of sustainable agriculture. This article introduces the development of SDG Indicator 2.4.1, with particular emphasis on the achievements and challenges. SDG 2 ‘Zero Hunger’ has an objective to support sustainable agriculture and enhance food security at global level. SDG Target 2.4 has a clear aim that more sustainable food production systems and agricultural practices can be implemented by 2030 (FAO, 2022 ). SDG Indicator 2.4.1 is the only indicator which monitor the progress of achieving SDG Target 2.4, and also the only indicator in the framework of SDGs that specifically addressing sustainable agriculture. The achievements in developing SDG Indicator 2.4.1 reflect the efforts and progress in sustainable agriculture and relevant research, while the challenges of developing this indicator are also reasons for the under-exploration of some issues about sustainable agriculture. This short perspective also calls for future studies in related fields.  2 The development of SDG Indicator 2.4.1 2.1 Clarify the policy-orientation of SDG Indicator 2.4.1 Throughout the development of SDG Indicator 2.4.1, it is emphasized that this indicator has an important objective to support the design and implementation of sustainable agriculture policies (FAO, 2017a ). That means, instead of focusing on the academic impact, providing information to support policy discussion and implementation is the broad aim of developing this indicator (FAO, 2017b ). Particularly, it is expected that SDG Indicator 2.4.1 should be meaningful and useful for all countries, and therefore the universality and consistency with international statistical standards of this indicator are emphasized when developing this indicator (FAO, 2017a , 2022 ). However, although the policy-orientation of SDG Indicator 2.4.1 is confirmed, there is still an on-going need to clarify other key objectives of this indicator during its development. For example, in 2017, FAO was suggested by experts to continue clarifying whether this indicator aims to drive a conversation on sustainable agriculture at country level (FAO, 2017a ). This has methodological implications and also leads to the efforts to define the concept of sustainable agriculture, which is another substantial achievement in the development of SDG Indicator 2.4.1.  2.2 Defining sustainable agriculture Various definitions and measurements of sustainable agriculture can be found in existing literature. For example, Roy and Chan (2012)  defined sustainable agriculture as the agricultural practice which permanently meets essential conditions. These conditions should be congruent with ecological stability, economic viability and socially fair agricultural systems. The measurement of agricultural sustainability emphasizes the integration of environmental, economic and social dimensions, although environmental themes may attract more attention (Binder et al., 2010 ). The variations in the definitions and measurements of sustainable agriculture reflect the multi-dimensional and interdisciplinary nature of sustainable agriculture, and the needs to have a more holistic approach to monitor agricultural sustainability. The development of SDG Indicator 2.4.1 demonstrates the efforts to define sustainable agriculture and measure agricultural sustainability. Following consultations and literature reviews, FAO uses a multi-dimensional approach to define sustainable agriculture as the agricultural activities which can sustainably satisfy human needs for present and future generations (FAO, 2022 ). These agricultural activities should be technically appropriate, economically viable and socially acceptable, and not lead to environmental degradation (FAO, 2022 ). A ‘traffic light’ approach is established to identify the sustainability status of agricultural land, based on data collected from agricultural holdings and aggregated at national level (FAO, 2019 ). In the reporting dashboard, the sustainability status of agricultural land is set at three levels with the ‘traffic light’ approach: desirable level (green), acceptable level (yellow), and unsustainable level (red). For each country, SDG Indicator 2.4.1 is the aggregated proportion of agricultural lands which achieved the acceptable level or above (FAO, 2022 ). In other words, the gross land area under productive and sustainable agriculture is the numerator in SDG Indicator 2.4.1, and the denominator is the total agricultural land area of each country.  2.3 Measure sustainable agriculture: the selection of sub-indicators The above mentioned ‘traffic light’ approach is currently operationalized by 11 sub-indicators. In line with FAO's multi-dimensional definition of sustainable agriculture, each sub-indicator correspond to one of the three dimensions (economic, social, and environmental), as shown in Table 1  . In comparison with some other agricultural and environmental indicator systems, the above-mentioned sub-indicators are relatively more general (Florin et al., 2012 ). It is noticed that the vague conceptualization of sustainable agriculture in SDG Indicator 2.4.1 brings difficulties to include some more specific and widely used sub-indicators (Gil et al., 2019 ). Although the definitions and units of measurements of these sub-indicators are provided (FAO, 2022 ), there is limited knowledge of how these sub-indicators can be downscaled and more specific, especially across agricultural production systems. For example, in terms of the sub-indicator ‘secure tenure rights to land’, the definition and application vary in different societies (e.g., Liu, 2022 ), and legal/official documented ‘land titles’ may not fully capture the actual rights of owning/accessing agricultural lands in some countries. Instead traditional land tenures can better reflect the actual rights to agricultural lands in some countries (FAO, 2023 ). However, the sub-indicator ‘secure tenure rights to land’ under SDG Indicator 2.4.1 does not reflect such specifics and varieties (FAO, 2022 ). The selection of sub-indicators is neither simple nor straightforward. The lack of suitable sub-indicators to operationalize SDG Indicator 2.4.1 is a core reason which kept this indicator in Tier 3 class (indicators without internationally established methods or standards yet) for a long time. The Expert Meeting in 2017 was an early attempt to select adequate sub-indicators for SDG Indicator 2.4.1. The proposed principles for selecting sub-indicators include ‘policy relevance’, ‘universality’, ‘comparability’, ‘measurability’, and ‘cost effectiveness’, as shown in a pre-meeting methodological note (FAO, 2017b , p15). In the Expert Meeting, a new criterion ‘independence’ was added (Gennari and Navarro, 2019 ). That means, the sub-indicators should have minimum overlap with each other, although the overlap with other SDG indicators is allowed. To facilitate the selection of sub-indicators by the multi-expertise participants, the participants were presented with a long list of possible sub-indicators abstracted from literature, and a Delphi Technique exercise was adopted to rank these sub-indicators (FAO, 2017a ). As a result of the Delphi Technique exercise, 9 initial sub-indicators under the three dimensions of sustainable agriculture were selected to operationalize SDG Indicator 2.4.1 (Gennari and Navarro, 2019 , p7). However, some of these initial sub-indicators were unclear and may not be easily interpreted. For example, the concept of the initial sub-indicator ‘agricultural heterogeneity’ is rather vague. Therefore, the Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) requested FAO to add sub-indicators on the pollution of pesticides and fertilizers (Gennari and Navarro, 2019 ), which are relatively easier to define and understand. Following a series of pilot country tests of these sub-indicators, SDG Indicator 2.4.1 was promoted as a Tier 2 SDG indicator by the IAEG-SDGs in 2018, as its methods and standards become internationally established and accepted (FAO, 2020a ). Further efforts were also made to refine the sub-indicator on biodiversity and the current 11 sub-indicators were confirmed to operationalize SDG Indicator 2.4.1.  2.4 Data collection Collecting reliable and internationally comparable data for SDG Indicator 2.4.1 is a complex and expensive process. A wide range of data collection tools for SDG Indicator 2.4.1 were discussed, from farm surveys (the recommended tool) to remote sensing (FAO, 2017a ). FAO has developed aligned instruments such as the 50 × 2030 Initiative to support the development and refinement of farm surveys (FAO, 2020b ). Pilot test of data collection were also organized by FAO in a number of different countries (FAO, 2020a ). However, at national level, the reporting rate for this indicator was zero in the most recent period between 2017 and 2021 (Bizier et al., 2022 ). Although there is a plan to report the country level data for SDG Indicator 2.4.1 in late 2022 at the end of a three-year data collecting and reporting cycle (FAO, 2022 ), it is unable to predict the exact percentage of countries in which the data would be available. The lack of existing data collection tools and sampling frames is a reason for the low availability of data for SDG Indicator 2.4.1. The difficulty to collect all required data for this indicator and its 11 sub-indicators via the same instrument also reduces the data availability of SDG Indicator 2.4.1 (FAO, 2020b ). Countries also need extra assistance in improving the capacity to collect and produce data for SDG Indicator 2.4.1, and it is counter-intuitive that a substantial proportion of such requests for assistance come from developed countries with relatively strong statistical capacity (Bizier et al., 2022 ). The progress in developing SDG Indicator 2.4.1 reflected the efforts and achievements in pursuing sustainable agriculture, including addressing some under-explored major issues such as biodiversity conservation and land tenure rights. The development of SDG Indicator 2.4.1 is not immune from challenges and limitations, which are briefly discussed in the next section.   3 Challenges and limitations of SDG Indicator 2.4.1 Although substantial achievements were witnessed, the development of SDG Indicator 2.4.1 is not simple at all. The development of SDG Indicator 2.4.1 is a multi-stakeholder, multi-dimensional, interdisciplinary, and cross-national process. Such a complex leads to a number of challenges and limitations of this indicator. 3.1 Insufficient interdisciplinary and multi-dimensional expertise The multi-dimensional and interdisciplinary nature of sustainable agriculture has been identified via the process of developing SDG Indicator 2.4.1. However, insufficient interdisciplinary and multi-dimensional expertise has been utilized in relevant fields, as shown in the development SDG Indicator 2.4.1. For example, although SDG Indicator 2.4.1 has connections with other SDG indicators (e.g., FAO, 2022 ), the research on the interactions across SDGs is still an emerging trend that is far from well-developed (Nilsson et al., 2016 ; Liu, 2020 , 2022 ). As shown in the previous section, sustainable agriculture is highly multi-dimensional and involves substantial cross-dimensional interactions (e.g., environmental, economic, and societal). It requires high-level interdisciplinary expertise to study sustainable agriculture and develop adequate indicators to measure and monitor its progress. However, such interdisciplinary and multi-dimensional expertise may not be easily available. For example, the sub-indicator ‘secure tenure rights to land’ is officially considered as the equivalence of SDG Indicator 5.a.1 customised for SDG Indicator 2.4.1 (FAO, 2022 ). But this may not be exactly the situation because SDG Indicator 5.a.1 monitors the gender disparity in agricultural landownership (FAO, 2023 ), which is actually a sign of gender gap in accessing essential resources and services. Such difficulties in understanding these related but different concepts and SDG indicators and interactions across SDGs reflects the lack of interdisciplinary and multi-dimension expertise, which somewhat explains the under-study of issues in relation to sustainable agriculture. The inaccurate equalization of ‘secure tenure rights to land’ under SDG Indicator 2.4.1 and SDG Indicator 5.a.1 is also possibly as a result of the insufficient interdisciplinary expertise to properly explore gender disparity in rights to land with the angle of sustainable agriculture.  3.2 Diversity of interest across stakeholders Coordinated by FAO, the development of SDG Indicator 2.4.1 is a multi-stakeholder and multi-national process. Although the stakeholders have the common objective to develop a suitable indicator for monitoring the progress of sustainable agriculture, it does not mean that they do not have differences in interest and/or priorities. The development of SDGs, targets, and indicators is a process that consists of conflicts between statistical experts and politicians, which sometimes turn the process into a chaotic shouting game (Kapto, 2019 ), and lead to difficulties in adhering SDGs, targets, and indicators to scientific (statistical) principles (e.g., Gennari and Navarro, 2019 ). The development of SDG Indicator 2.4.1, similar to many other international consensuses, is a process of negotiation and compromise across stakeholders, and an agreement is reached as a result of the concessions from different stakeholders (Hák et al., 2016 ; Kapto, 2019 ). For example, the Expert Meeting (including the pre-meeting consultations) were participated by various stakeholders such as workers for international organizations, national government officials, academic researchers, and representatives of non-government organizations (FAO, 2017a ). They have different interest and/or priorities in developing SDG Indicator 2.4.1. For example, the take-home messages and recommendations for further actions from participants show that there are notable concerns about country's ownership of SDG Indicator 2.4.1 and freedom to set national standard for this indicator (FAO, 2017a ). These concerns are based more on politics (statistical sovereignty) instead of science. Such diversity of interest is a challenge of SDG Indicator 2.4.1 and also leads to difficulty in addressing some under-studied issues related to sustainable agriculture. In addition, agriculture and agricultural systems are highly-diverse across countries (e.g., Giller et al., 2021 ; Sumberg and Giller, 2022 ), which is presented as a challenge to develop a specific yet universal indicator to measure the progress of sustainable agriculture. Although the invited participants of the Expert Meeting were from different parts of the world (FAO, 2017a ), it is unlikely for each expert to have comprehensive knowledge of all agricultural systems in the world. Therefore, their expertise may be based on certain specific yet different regions, which bring difficulties to develop an international indicator that can suit the measurement of sustainable agriculture in different countries. Taking the sub-indicator ‘secure tenure rights to land’ as an example, the actual (or de facto) land tenure rights vary across countries, especially those with different (agricultural) land ownership systems (FAO, 2023 ). Therefore, it is unable to have a uniformed measurement of agricultural land tenure rights, which leads to challenges in construct an international indicator to monitor the progress of sustainable agriculture.  3.3 Cross-criteria trade-offs As shown in the previous section, a number of criteria were adopted to select the sub-indicator to operationalize SDG Indicator 2.4.1. These criteria, however, are not fully compatible with each other. Instead, there are possible trade-offs between criteria. Particularly, as demonstrated by the development of SDG Indicator 2.4.1, trade-offs exist between the universality, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness of this indicator. For example, as discussed in the Expert Meeting in 2017, it is emphasized that although the indicator and sub-indicators should function across countries, there is not universal threshold suitable for sub-indicators in different countries. Therefore, it is recommended to provide countries with more flexibility in monitoring the progress of sustainable agriculture at national level. But this somewhat contradicts to the efforts to promote the tier classification of SDG Indicator 2.4.1, which requires internationally established methods and standards. Also, the cross-country comparisons would be more difficult if there is too much flexibility at national level. The situation when cost-effectiveness is taken into consideration. As an example, remote-sensing can be a good supplementary to the recommended data collection tool (farm surveys) for SDG Indicator 2.4.1, but the financial and technological considerations may restrict its use at international level. Therefore, it would not be suitable in the near future to recommend a wide use of remote-sensing to collect data for this indicator, although its cost-effectiveness has been noted. Trade-offs across the three dimensions (economic, environmental, and societal) of SDG Indicator 2.4.1 and its sub-indicators may also exist, which has not been fully addressed by the current ‘traffic light’ approach. For example, in certain circumstances, the improvement in the management of fertilizers (environmental dimension) may lead to the reduction of net farm income (economic dimension), if the increased cost in fertilizer management may not be covered by the associated economic returns. However, the ‘traffic light’ approach cannot fully capture such trade-offs. The existence of cross-criteria and cross-dimensional trade-offs is a challenge of SDG Indicator 2.4.1, and also a reason for the under-exploration of some important issues about sustainable agriculture. The consideration of cost-effectiveness restricts the efforts in using modern technology such as remote-sensing to bridge the existing data gaps in sustainable agriculture. It may actually enlarge the cross-country disparity in data collection (Bizier et al., 2022 ), as developed countries are more likely to use modern technology to facilitate data collection.   4 Concluding remarks This short article briefly reviews the development of SDG Indicator 2.4.1. While the progress in developing this indicator demonstrates the achievements in sustainable agriculture and related studies, the limitations of SDG Indicator 2.4.1 also reflect the challenges of sustainable agriculture and are also reasons for the under-exploration of some major issues such as biodiversity conservation, land tenure rights, and data gaps in sustainable agriculture. This perspective supports more interdisciplinary research to address the challenges of SDG Indicator 2.4.1, as the development of this indicator is a multi-stakeholder process which requires expertise in different fields, especially the support from making and using evidence-based policy interventions for data collection and interpretation. The high diversity of agricultural production systems and the stakeholders of sustainable agriculture calls for more cross-country and inter-sectoral dialogues. A ‘learning-by-doing’ approach is recommended for addressing the under-studied issues about sustainable agriculture and the future improvement of SDG Indicator 2.4.1, including the study on the possible trade-offs across criteria and dimensions of sub-indicators. The development of SDG Indicator 2.4.1 has already demonstrated the complexity of establishing an internationally-agreed (while with adequate national-level flexibility) indicator to monitor the progress of sustainable agriculture. This article also serves as a call for future research in sustainable agriculture, especially in addressing some under-explored issues such as indicator development and data gaps in sustainable agriculture. In addition, the experiences and lessons of developing other SDG indicators (especially those related to food security and rural development) could be used for the further development of SDG Indicator 2.4.1, and vice versa. More collaboration and communication among teams specialized in different SDGs should therefore be encouraged.
