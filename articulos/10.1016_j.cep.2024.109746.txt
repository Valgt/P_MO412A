                  Greenhouse gas emissions, specifically CO2 and H2S, are recognized as a serious environmental issue. To address this, various strategies have been suggested. Among these, an economic-environmental study is presented, focusing on a methanol production process that utilizes CO2 and H2S waste streams from a natural gas sweetening plant. The study aims to identify conditions that enhance the production of value-added products and increase methanol yields while reducing costs. Given the complexity of processes involving numerous variables such as pressure, temperature, flow rates, and others, pinpointing the most impactful variables for effective manipulation poses a significant challenge. To tackle this, the study adopts a factorial experimental design coupled with ANOVA analysis to determine the variables that most significantly affect the process. Based on this analysis, the study suggests process improvement through energy integration. Results, derived from the experimental design and ANOVA analysis, reveal that reactor temperatures play a crucial role in influencing the process's effectiveness.

Greenhouse gas emissions, specifically CO2  and H2 S, are recognized as a serious environmental issue. To address this, various strategies have been suggested. Among these, an economic-environmental study is presented, focusing on a methanol production process that utilizes CO2  and H2 S waste streams from a natural gas sweetening plant. The study aims to identify conditions that enhance the production of value-added products and increase methanol yields while reducing costs. Given the complexity of processes involving numerous variables such as pressure, temperature, flow rates, and others, pinpointing the most impactful variables for effective manipulation poses a significant challenge. To tackle this, the study adopts a factorial experimental design coupled with ANOVA analysis to determine the variables that most significantly affect the process. Based on this analysis, the study suggests process improvement through energy integration. Results, derived from the experimental design and ANOVA analysis, reveal that reactor temperatures play a crucial role in influencing the process's effectiveness.

As the world's population continues to grow, energy requirements as well as its associated problems are ever-increasing*. Natural gas, a natural energy source, is considered a cleaner form of energy than that of fossil fuels, and recent discoveries of natural gas reserves are encouraging its exploitation. In order for natural gas to be used, it must first go through a sweetening process to eliminate some of its impurities [3 ,31 ,48 ,51 ]. These impurities, known as acid gases, are mainly made up of sulfur compounds and carbon dioxide with small portions of inert gases and water, and they represent a risk to the environment and to the industry [7 ,24 ]. Out of all the processes suggested to remove acid gases from natural gas, the use of amines as a chemical absorption solvent is the most widely used technology. Its use as an absorption solvent offers several advantages, e.g. adaptability to different operating conditions, ease of solvent obtainment, less absorption of light hydrocarbons, etc. [22 ,30 ,34 ]. However, this technique's main disadvantage is that high temperatures are required to regenerate the chemical solvent, which significantly raises the operating costs of the process; thus, limiting and modifying the operations of existing processing facilities [7 ,22 ,24,44 ]. Once all impurities have been removed from the natural gas, they become an environmental problem. Therefore, different technologies, such as CO2  capture and the Claus process have been proposed to mitigate these acid gas emissions; although they might prove costly for chemical industries [17,23 ,25 ,28 ]. Other technologies have been proposed to convert these greenhouse gases into high-value-added products, such as syngas [9 ,11 ,32,39 ]. Syngas, consequently, is used as raw material in the production of methanol [14 ,15 ,19 ,20 ,38 ]. Methanol is extremely important for the global economy as it is used as a feedstock to produce a large number of chemicals and supply chains [45] . It is estimated that methanol is used in the production of up to 30% of industrial chemicals worldwide [49]  such as plastics, paints, cosmetics, fuels, etc. Methanol is also an energy resource used in the marine, automotive, and power sectors. Due to methanol's high application within different sectors, it is necessary to find operating conditions that will allow for the attainment of better results in its production. The study of this process is mainly supported by modeling and simulation, due to the time and costs required. Furthermore, through the use of these tools it is possible to perform economic feasibility studies to analyze the influence of operating conditions such as temperature and pressure [2 ,14 ,40 ] as well as propose conditions that will reduce the operating and investment costs [15 ,33 ,40 ]. Another aspect of vital importance in the study of methanol production is the environmental component [2 ,26 ,52 ], which seeks to reduce the emissions produced in the process [5 ,23 ,53 ,55 ]. In addition to economic-environmental analyses, new tools have emerged within the past few years that are able to locate the configurations in industrial processes to make them sustainable. One of these tools is Process Intensification (PI) [43] . The concept of PI, as defined by Moulijn et al., [37] , encompasses various aspects including the reduction of natural resource consumption, minimization of equipment size, and decrease in the quantity of equipment used. In conjunction with PI, energy integration reduces the number of heat exchangers required in the process. And in turn, a reduction in the overall energy consumption of the process takes place as well as a reduction in the emissions produced [42] . The literature review for the proposed study on methanol synthesis from waste streams of the natural gas sweetening process highlights several key works that align with the focus on methanol recovery from waste streams. Iaquaniello et al. [21]  assess the waste-to-methanol (WtM) process, demonstrating its economic and environmental viability, with significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional methods. Tabibian & Sharifzadeh [47]  provide a comprehensive overview of methanol applications and production technologies, emphasizing the potential and challenges of renewable methanol, including bio-methanol and e-methanol. Abdelaziz et al. [1]  explore novel technologies for converting CO2  from industrial flue gas streams into methanol, offering a competitive alternative to biomass-based methods and achieving substantial reductions in CO2  emissions. These studies collectively underline the significance of methanol recovery from various waste streams, offering a context within which the current work aims to optimize the methanol synthesis process from natural gas sweetening waste streams, utilizing statistical techniques for variable selection and proposing energy integration for enhanced efficiency and reduced emissions. This background sets the stage for the contribution of the current study in advancing the field of sustainable methanol production. Building on the insights from key studies in the field, this work proposes an economic-environmental study to determine the optimal operating design conditions for a methanol synthesis process utilizing waste streams from a natural gas sweetening process, as illustrated in Fig. 1  . With respect to the natural gas sweetening process, the data was obtained from a plant in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. Due to the complexity of the methanol synthesis process and the need to consider numerous configurations when selecting design and operation variables, the use of a statistical technique is proposed to quantify the effect of the process variables on the costs and emissions produced. Finally, an energy integration in the process is proposed in order to reduce the energy consumption and the emissions that are produced in the process.  2 Methodology This section presents a description of the methanol production process used in this work, beginning with the simulation of the process using the ASPEN HYSYS® software. Afterward, the experimental design and an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) are used to select the appropriate decision variables in the process, and subsequently, the economic-environmental study of the process is carried out. In the study, ANOVA is chosen for several key reasons [35 ]. Firstly, ANOVA is particularly effective in comparing three or more groups for statistical significance. This is crucial in the research as it aims to understand the differences across multiple groups under varying conditions. By using ANOVA, it is possible to assess whether any observed differences in means are statistically significant or if they occur by chance. Secondly, ANOVA is beneficial in its ability to handle a variety of data sets and experimental designs. It is robust against certain types of errors and is flexible in terms of the number of samples and groups. This adaptability makes ANOVA an ideal choice for the study, which involves complex data and a range of variables. Through ANOVA, a thorough analysis can be conducted, ensuring that the findings are reliable and accurate in reflecting the true effects of the variables under investigation. Finally, an energy integration is performed aiming to reduce the energy used in heating utilities. Fig. 2   presents a general scheme of the methodology used. 2.1 Simulation of natural gas sweetening Currently, natural gas sweetening using amines as a chemical solvent is the most widely used process in the removal of acid gases from natural gas [24] . Methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) is a tertiary alkanolamine and the most common agent used in the treatment of sour gas. Being a tertiary amine, MDEA is highly selective to H2 S, a component that is to be removed in its entirety within the process (Mokhatab et al., 2015). Broadly speaking, the natural gas sweetening process can be divided into two main stages. In the first stage, the removal of the acid gases present in the feed gas takes place, while in the second stage, the regeneration of the solvent used, in this case, MDEA, occurs. Fig. 3   exemplifies the natural gas sweetening process using amines. Table 1   shows the equipment used in the natural gas sweetening simulation. The natural acid gas (Table 2  ) that enters the process, at a pressure of 6826 kPa and a temperature of 34 °C, is taken to a separator tank where it passes through a filter that removes possible liquids and the pipe scale that may accompany it. The outgoing gas enters through the bottom into an apparatus that contacts the amine solution (Table 3  ), at a pressure of 6762 kPa and a temperature of 44 °C, fed from the top of the apparatus. The solution then flows down the apparatus while the acid gas rises. Within the apparatus, there is an absorption column in charge of making contact and hosting the absorption reactions. This process is generally carried out at high pressures and low temperatures. As the gas rises, the concentration of acid gases decreases; and as the solvent descends it becomes abundant in acid gases. The gas that leaves this equipment at the top, generally with a temperature similar to that of the fed of amine, is considered sweet gas. This sweet gas usually passes to a separator tank responsible for the removal of possible solvent liquids that might have been dragged there by the gas. Once the sweet gas passes through this equipment, it leaves the process [24] . The amine, rich in acid gases, leaves the column at a higher temperature than it entered due to the energy released by the absorption reactions [7] . This amine continues its trip toward a rich/poor amine heat exchanger where its temperature increases, thanks to the energy given up by the already regenerated amine, in order to enter the regenerating tower. Once inside the tower, the temperature of the rich amine is increased in order to desorb the acid gases; unlike absorption, this process is carried out at low pressures and high temperatures. The amine that exits through the bottom is regenerated at high temperatures. The amine is then sent to the amine-rich/poor heat exchanger and is subsequently reincorporated into the absorption process to complete the regenerative cycle [24] . The results obtained in the simulation using ASPEN HSYYS were compared with the data provided by the sweetening plant. A total relative error of 3.2 % was obtained, a percentage within the range reported in the literature, where values of up to 12 % have been reported [18] .  2.2 Syngas production simulation To simulate the syngas production process (Fig. 4  ), the designs proposed by Solis-Jacome et al . [46] , Bassani et al . [8] , and Dell'Angelo et al . [13] , were considered; however, in this work, during the simulation and throughout the manipulation of the operating conditions, it was possible to increase the conversion of H2 S and CO2 . Because of this increase, the use of absorption and amine recovery columns was avoided. Table 4   shows the equipment used for syngas production. An “Acid gas” stream was used as a raw material in the syngas production. Table 5   shows the composition of the acid gas mixture obtained as a residue from the sweetening process, where CO2  and H2 S can be seen appearing in the same proportion. The reactants (CO2  and H2 S) from the waste streams of the industrial plants are fed at a temperature of 33 °C to the first heat exchanger in order to be preheated to 600 °C and are subsequently fed into the first reactor, where the conversion of H2 S, CO2,  and any hydrocarbon present in the mixture is carried out following the stoichiometry in reaction 1 [13] .(1) 2 H 2  S + C O 2  → H 2  + C O + S 2  + H 2  O      It is in this reactor where the products of interest (CO and H2 ) are obtained and the residues of H2 S and CO2  that were not able to be converted are connected to a second heat exchanger to heat the gas mixture to 800 °C. These residues are then fed to a second reactor where the hydrocarbons present in the mixture react with water to produce more syngas, as shown in reaction 2 [13] .(2) C n  H 2 n + 2   + n H 2  O → n C O + ( 2 n + 1 )  H 2       Subsequently, in the third reactor, the use of recirculation of CH4  that had been previously obtained in the natural gas cleaning process to carry out reaction 3 is proposed (where methane reacts with the remaining CO2  from the process to increase the production of syngas) [8] .(3) C O 2  + C H 4  → 2 C O + 2 H 2       The evaluation of the syngas production application using CO2  and H2 S waste streams as raw material is presented below. Table 6   presents the composition obtained from the syngas stream (1770 kg/h) (where the mixture is mainly composed of H2  and CO), as well as conversions higher than 95 % obtained for CO2  and H2 S. Similar results to these conversions have been reported by Dell'Angelo et al . [13] , Bassani et al . [8] , Park et al . (2020), and Peng et al . [41] .  2.3 Methanol synthesis simulation Subsequently, a plant was coupled for methanol production [20] . Table 7   shows the equipment used in the process. The syngas stream obtained in the process was used as feedstock (Table 8  ). Where from the obtained syngas stream, methanol is produced from the reaction:(4) C O + H 2  → C H 3  O H      In order for this to occur, it is necessary to raise the system pressure to 7880 kPa with a temperature of 200 °C as it passes through a series of compressors and heat exchangers as shown in Fig. 5  . Afterward, from the reaction process, the syngas stream is taken to a distillation column to separate the methanol from the water, thus obtaining pure methanol.  2.4 Experimental design A fundamental part of the Environmental-Economic Analysis is the selection of the decision variables as these are the variables that will be manipulated to improve the overall process. In this process, there are a large number of variables that can be manipulated (Fig. 6  ). The proper selection of these variables is of vital importance. Hence, the use of an ANOVA analysis has been proposed to determine the most important decision variables in the process [4] . It has been reported, within the literature, that the important factors in the process are the feed flow and the process temperature [12 ,13 ,52 ]; therefore, a fractional design 63  was proposed for each of these factors to determine its statistical significance on the response variables. The flow of syngas that were obtained along with the energy consumption of the process were selected as response variables for this case. Table 9   shows the levels selected for each factor used in the experimental design. After the results of each of the runs were obtained, an ANOVA was performed using the Minitab 2019 software. The parameters with a value of p  < 0.5 were considered as statistically significant [36] .  2.5 Environmental economic analysis To carry out the economic-environmental analysis, the following aspects were considered: total annual CO2  emissions (TAE), the total annual cost (TAC), and the annual methanol production obtained [19 ,32 ,43 ,53 ]. To calculate CO2  emissions, the methodology proposed by Gadalla et al . (2016) was used; where the CO2  generated from furnaces, gas turbines, and boilers, due to fuel combustion was considered. The APSEN HYSYS software was used to quantify the temperature of each of the heat exchangers used as well as the annual production of CO2  emissions. This study indicates CO2  has an important role in climate change. Air is mostly nitrogen and oxygen, but even small amounts of CO2  can influence the greenhouse effect. This idea comes from various studies, like Gadalla et al. [16 ], who investigated reducing CO2  emissions in distillation systems; Aydin & İlkiliç [6 ], who discussed the effects of air pollutants; and Liu et al. [29 ], who showed a connection between CO2  and air pollutants in China. These studies together show we need to work on both lowering CO2  and making air cleaner, highlighting the importance of understanding emissions in environmental studies. To calculate the TAC, the utility costs for the exchangers, compressors, and pumps, and the 15-year annualized capital cost for all of the equipment were considered using the equations of Turton [50] . For the profit obtained in the process, the annual methanol production (AMP) was considered taking into account a selling price of 0.576 US$/kg (Methanol Institute, 2023). The PROFIT is then calculated, using Eq. (5) :(5) P R O F I T = A M P − T A C      The TAE and the PROFIT were calculated for each of the proposed combinations by means of the experimental design. Thus, the behavior of these parameters was analyzed with respect to their operating conditions.  2.6 Energy integration Operating conditions showed that in the methanol and syngas production process high temperatures are necessary to carry out the reaction (where the energy required by these reactors is satisfied by the heating utilities supplied in heat exchangers). In addition, cooling utilities are also required in the process which are supplied by the exchangers. Considering the above, the integration of the process has been heartily proposed in order to minimize the use of utilities as well as to reduce the associated costs. To carry out the energy integration, a MINLP (mixed-integer non-linear programming) model, based on the models previously presented by Yee and Grossman [54] , and Lira-Barragán et al. [27]  has been considered. The model aims to minimize the total annual cost and to satisfy the heating and cooling utilities. This model has also been coded in the GAMS® software [10] . Heat exchange is carried out by any coincidence in each stage between the HPS  and the CPS . After the HPS  transfer their energy to the CPS , the HPS  will then transfer their remaining heat load through coolers that operate with cold utilities (CU ). On the other hand, the CPS  will complete their heating through heaters using hot utilities (HU ) to reach their target temperature. The mathematical formulation of the model is defined by the following sections: total energy balances for the process streams, energy balance for internal stages, energy balance for external stages, assignment of temperature for the extreme borders of the inner stages, constraints for the temperature feasibility in the superstructure, the existence of heat exchangers, feasibilities for the temperature differences, and objective function. The objective function of the model is to minimize the total annual cost (TAC ) of the network. The network involves the combination of the utility cost (UtC ), the fixed costs (FiC ) of exchangers, and the capital costs (CaC ) of each exchanger:(6) M i n  T A C = U t C + F i C + C a C      Detailed equations for calculating the utility cost, fixed costs, and capital costs as discussed are available in the Supporting Information  (Equations S1 to S3). Based on the data, two HPS  and two CPS  are considered for energy integration, while the stream data are presented in Table 10  . It should be taken into account that the objective of energy integration is to obtain the optimum configuration and consequently remodel the process with the results obtained.   3 Results Moving into the results of the study, the syngas flow obtained from Table 6  was used as raw material in the production of methanol, which resulted in the acquirement of methanol with a purity of 0.99 at the end of the process [20] . With respect to the implemented ANOVA analysis, it became clear that the factors that presented a significant effect on the TAE and the PROFIT were the sour gas flow, the temperature of the B12 and B14 reactors, and the B33 distiller's still. A new experimental design was then proposed with these parameters and a sweep was made within the operating limits and a TAE and a PROFIT were calculated for each combination. Fig. 7   shows the behavior of the PROFIT vs. the TAE for each of the combinations studied. The relationship between PROFIT and TAE, as depicted in Fig. 7 , reveals a significant correlation between the profitability of methanol production processes and CO2  emissions. This pattern indicates that methanol production operations with lower profitability tend to be more polluting, suggesting inefficient resource management or the use of operational conditions that, though less expensive initially, result in higher CO2  output. Conversely, an increase in PROFIT corresponds with a decrease in CO2  emissions. This observation suggests that more profitable methanol production operations implement operational conditions that not only enhance resource use but also minimize environmental impacts. Such conditions could involve adjustments in the methanol production process, better energy management, or the employment of production practices that, despite potentially requiring a higher initial investment, lead to a more efficient and less polluting process. This trend underscores a fundamental principle: economic efficiency and environmental sustainability can progress hand in hand in the context of methanol production. Operations aiming to maximize their profitability, through careful adjustment of their production conditions, concurrently contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing CO2  emissions. Therefore, the inverse relationship between PROFIT and TAE highlights the potential for synergy between economic goals and ecological responsibility within methanol production. The data presented in Fig. 7  provide a compelling argument for integrating environmental considerations into the operational strategies of methanol production businesses. They highlight the ability to achieve a dual objective: enhancing economic outcomes while simultaneously contributing to the reduction of environmental impacts, specifically by lowering CO2  emissions. It is clear that there are different scenarios for the production of methanol, where the PROFIT values can be obtained with values close to 0 and greater than 2 × 106  USD; results that contrast with the literature [20 ,53 ,55 ]. Something similar occurs with the TAE; there are some scenarios where the operations seem to be favorable [20 ,23 ,53 ]. However, there is a point that presented a higher profit of 2.1 × 106  which was the highest value obtained in this analysis, and with a mean value with respect to the TAE of 1.35 × 105 . This point seems to be the best option when comparing the PROFIT obtained and its respective TAE. The respective operating conditions for this point are presented in Table 11  . As an intensification strategy, an energy integration was performed at the selected point, in order to reduce the heating and cooling services in the process and, in turn, the number of heat exchangers used. Fig. 8   shows the results obtained from the energy integration. It can be seen that it was possible to perform a recirculation of streams. The “S7” stream is used to heat the "S4", the "S2″ and the "ACID GAS" streams, and is subsequently incorporated into the B17 equipment. In addition, the M6 stream is used to heat the "ACID GAS". With the new configuration obtained using energy integration, the PROFIT and the TAE were calculated and compared with those previously obtained (Table 12  ). The results show that there was an increase in the profit of the process of 3.5 × 105  USD, and a decrease in the TAE of 4.49 × 104  Ton CO2 /year. A different intensification proposal to reduce the number of units utilized was the replacement of compressors "B18", "B20″ and "B22″ for that of a single compressor, as well as the replacement of compressors "B27", "B29″ and "B31″ for that of a single compressor (Fig. 9  ). When calculating the PROFIT and the TAE obtained in the new intensified proposal, an increase in PROFIT of 1.05 × 104  USD and an increase of 2.3 × 103  Ton CO2 /year for TAE was obtained, compared to the first proposed process (Fig. 6 ). Energy integration in the process was also proposed; however, the savings obtained in this process did not achieve a better profit than that of the first process. The enhanced conversion of H2 S and CO2  achieved through the manipulation of operating conditions, as demonstrated in this study, is in alignment with the experimental data from foundational research, specifically referenced in Hernandez-Perez et al., [20] , Yang & You [53] , and Zhang et al., [55] . These improvements are grounded in empirical evidence rather than being mere theoretical extrapolations. The original works proposing these design modifications have shown similar enhancements in conversion rates, thus providing a robust basis for this methodology and findings. The congruence of the results with these established experimental outcomes not only validates our approach but also underscores the practical applicability of this study in real-world scenarios.  4 Conclusions This paper has presented a technical-economic analysis of the methanol production process from a waste stream of the natural gas sweetening process. The process was simulated using ASPEN HYSYS® considering the total annual cost of the process, the CO2  emissions produced, and the methanol production rate. A factorial design and ANOVA were implemented to perform an adequate selection of the decision variables in the process since the selection of decision variables has traditionally been performed artificially and without any standard method. Moreover, an energy integration was implemented in the process seeking to reduce the process heating utilities. Using the proposed approach, a new process design was suggested for waste stream treatment in the natural gas sweetening process in order to obtain value-added products. The new process was energetically integrated, and the results showed that the reactor temperatures were the most significant factors. The results also proved that the sour gas stream that was fed into the process and manipulated under operating conditions allowed for a better PROFIT with a low rate of CO2  emissions produced. The results showed that there was an increase in the PROFIT of the process of $350,000 USD with a decrease in the Total Annual Emissions (TAE) of 44,900 Ton CO2 /year. An intensification proposal aimed at reducing the number of used process units was the replacement of three compressors for a single compressor in two separate instances. When calculating the PROFIT and the TAE obtained in the new intensified proposal, an increase in the PROFIT of $10,500 USD and a decrease of 2300 Ton CO2 /year in the TAE was obtained, compared to that of the first proposed process. Energy integration in the process was also proposed, however, the savings obtained did not achieve a better profit than that of the first process.
