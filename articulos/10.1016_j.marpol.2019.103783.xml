                  While there have been estimates for the overall funding needs of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and for specific SDGs, there has been no attempt to estimate the funding needs of SDG 14, life below water, despite an impressive mobilization of financial sources the last couple of years. This lack of resourcing estimates is likely the result of the absence of information mainly at the national level of funding devoted to SDG 14 targets and of the complexity of identifying standards and actions for measuring SDG 14 targets. Using information from the proceedings of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the 2017 UN Ocean Conference, this paper presents the first ever attempt to present a likely cost for saving our oceans and a likely estimate of the funding gap for implementing SDG 14 until 2030. This paper also presents an analysis of this funding gap and recommendations for bridging it. It concludes with an estimate of US$174.52 billion per year needed for the health of our oceans. Knowing the resourcing requirements, efforts can be further stepped up and better targeted by different stakeholders, contributing thus to better conservation and sustainable use of our oceans.

         <xocs:funding-text>Positive news comes from the mobilization over the last couple of years of the international community and the concrete commitments pledged. The UN Ocean Conference in June 2017 resulted in around 1500 Voluntary Commitments towards the SDG 14 targets from governments, organizations, businesses, academia and philanthropy. In 2018 a new World Bank Trust Fund, PROBLUE, was established to strengthen the financial means for implementing SDG 14. Yet, resources allocated to SDG 14 are still limited.</xocs:funding-text>

                  <ce:simple-para id="abspara0010" view="all">While there have been estimates for the overall funding needs of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and for specific SDGs, there has been no attempt to estimate the funding needs of SDG 14, life below water, despite an impressive mobilization of financial sources the last couple of years. This lack of resourcing estimates is likely the result of the absence of information mainly at the national level of funding devoted to SDG 14 targets and of the complexity of identifying standards and actions for measuring SDG 14 targets. Using information from the proceedings of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the 2017 UN Ocean Conference, this paper presents the first ever attempt to present a likely cost for saving our oceans and a likely estimate of the funding gap for implementing SDG 14 until 2030. This paper also presents an analysis of this funding gap and recommendations for bridging it. It concludes with an estimate of US$174.52 billion per year needed for the health of our oceans. Knowing the resourcing requirements, efforts can be further stepped up and better targeted by different stakeholders, contributing thus to better conservation and sustainable use of our oceans.</ce:simple-para>

The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) has estimated the financial needs for the Aichi targets (these correspond to the SDG 14 and SDG 15 targets) at US$ 150–440 billion per year, while currently around US$ 52 billion is spent per year on biodiversity. The funding for SDG 14 is lagging behind in a similar fashion. At the 2017 UN Ocean Conference a rough amount of US$25.5 billion was committed for SDG 14, while this report estimates that the funding needs of the Goal are averagely at US$ 174.52 billion per year.</ce:para>

Yet, SDG 14 still awaits good implementation: four of the Goal's targets have 2020 as a deadline for substantial progress (these are protecting ecosystems, regulating fishing practises, establishing 10% of Marine Protected Areas, prohibiting fisheries subsidies).

                     <ce:para id="p0045" view="all">To estimate the cost of achieving each individual SDG 14 target by 2030 this paper has mainly used existing findings of the CBD proceedings regarding the Aichi targets, because specific Aichi targets match the SDG 14 targets. The Aichi targets on biodiversity are 20 targets on terrestrial and marine biodiversity (SDG 14 and SDG 15) with deadlines until 2020, adopted by the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2011. The Aichi targets that match the SDG 14 targets are: Aichi target 8, on marine pollution, which matches SDG 14.1, Aichi targets 5 and 10, on marine ecosystem protection and restoration, which match SDG 14.2, Aichi target 6 on sustainable fisheries, which matches SDG 14.4, and Aichi target 11 on conservation of coastal and marine areas, which matches SDG 14.5.</ce:para>

                     <ce:para id="p0080" view="all">This has been a difficult task since there is no official national or international reporting on SDG 14 related expenditure. This expenditure is primarily registered as voluntary commitments at international ocean conferences, such as the annual Our Ocean Conference and the 2017 UN Ocean Conference. For this paper we have used the data provided by the 2017 UN Ocean Conference. The 2017 first UN Ocean Conference resulted inter alia in the registration of around 1500 voluntary commitments. Although we have no financial information for all of the commitments, we do know that 541 of them amount to approximately US$25.5 billion.</ce:para>
                     <ce:para id="p0085" view="all">The UN Ocean Conference enjoyed global participation and engaged all stakeholders on the Ocean, governments, NGOs, organizations, private sector, etc. They all had the opportunity to register their commitments, as they did to a great extent, and re-registered commitments that were done in other fora. The UN Ocean Conference, this paper assumes, has consequently registered the main expenditures for SDG 14.</ce:para>
                     <ce:para id="p0090" view="all">The known amount covers one third of the commitments made. So, if all of them were priced, theoretically we would have an amount close to US $ 75 billion. However, this paper assumes that this calculation is counterbalanced by the fact that the US $ 25.5 billion is spread out over a period of 10 years for some of the commitments. The analysis report of the UN Ocean Conference notes that ‘there are large spikes in the graphs for the deliverables of the commitments for the years 2017–2018.’ The amount of US $ 25.5 billion is therefore taken as indicative of global expenditures per year for SDG 14.</ce:para>
                     <ce:para id="p0095" view="all">This assumption is backed by the more general spending for biodiversity. This is in the order of US $ 52 billion per year. While for biodiversity the expenditures needed are approximately US$ 295 billion, for SDG 14 the expenditures needed are in the order of US$174 billion. This relationship, SDG 14 requiring approximately half of the biodiversity expenditure, should be reflected also in the proportion of current spending for the two. Therefore SDG 14 spending should be around half of the biodiversity spending.</ce:para>

This data collection has a significant cost and there is an additional cost in helping fishery communities to diversify their economic base. Examples of costs include replacing fishing vessel engines to promote safety, with restrictions intended to result in a reduction in capacity.

Setting a policy target on GVA may also help mitigate overfishing and contribute to the production quality.<ce:cross-ref id="crosref0130" refid="fn24">

                     <ce:para id="p0240" view="all">While this amount is not a cost per year (some of the commitments extend to two, three or more years), this paper treats it as a per year amount for two reasons: firstly, the analysis report of the UN Ocean Conference notes that ‘there are large spikes in the graphs for the deliverables of the commitments for the years 2017–2018; secondly, the annual spending for biodiversity is of the order of US $ 52 billion. We have shown that while for biodiversity the expenditures needed are in the order of US$ 295 billion, for SDG 14 the expenditures needed are in the order of US $ 155 billion. This relationship, SDG 14 requiring approximately half of the biodiversity expenditure, should be reflected also in the relationship of current spending for the two. Therefore SDG 14 spending is highly probable to be around half of the biodiversity spending.</ce:para>
                     <ce:para id="p0245" view="all">While these estimates on the current spending for our Ocean seem highly uncertain, a recent OECD paper prepared for the G7 French Presidency (May 2019) supports their above range (and at the same time underlines the lack of basic data which could lead to safer estimates). According to this paper, partial data on domestic finance on biodiversity-relevant activities, as reported to the CBD Clearing House Mechanism by 40% of the Parties, was estimated at approximately USD 49 billion in 2015. Drawing on several other data sources – most of which do not include domestic central public biodiversity finance – preliminary estimates suggest that finance flows to biodiversity amount to roughly USD 39 billion. This estimate includes finance flows from economic instruments (such as biodiversity offsets), philanthropy and impact investing, and may feature some double counting owing to the way the data are reported across different data sets. It is important to note that these two estimates are partial and incomplete, and cannot be added due to a degree of overlap. As noted above, further work is required to develop robust estimates of global biodiversity finance.<ce:cross-ref id="crosref0145" refid="fn27">

                        <ce:para id="p0265" view="all">In brief, in the context of the G-7 and the G-20, the UN and the EU, as well as the African Union and the ASEAN we have witnessed important initiatives dealing with the ocean. Ocean pollution was on the agenda for the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan in 2019. In 2017 Malaysia launched the ASEAN Strategic Plan on the Environment (ASPEN) which has as main priority the conservation of coastal and marine ecosystems. The ASPEN shall serve as a comprehensive guide for ASEAN cooperation on environment for the period of 2016–2025. In 2015 the African Union launched the 2015–2025 Decade of African Seas and Oceans in the context of achieving the African Union Agenda 2063.</ce:para>
                        <ce:para id="p0270" view="all">In addition to annual conferences on the Ocean, such as the ‘Our Ocean Conferences’, which have been taking place since 2014 and the Economist World Ocean Summit, there has been the ground-breaking UN Ocean Conference in June 2017, which brought forward around 1500 voluntary commitments on SDG 14.</ce:para>
                        <ce:para id="p0275" view="all">In parallel, remarkable initiatives developed that mobilized attention to the ocean's health issues and ocean action. For example, the ‘Friends of Ocean Action’ initiative convened by the World Economic Forum. This is a coalition of 51 ocean leaders who are fast-tracking solutions to the most pressing challenges facing the ocean. Another important initiative is the High-level Panel for Sustainable Ocean Economy, launched by the Norwegian Prime Minister E. Solberg. This is a group of world leaders from around the globe committed to developing, catalyzing and supporting solutions for Ocean health and wealth in policy, governance, technology and finance.</ce:para>
                        <ce:para id="p0280" view="all">The global governance for the Ocean was promoted, as efforts were intensified to develop a legally binding instrument under UNCLOS on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. Another positive development is the negotiations of regulations to manage the impacts of mining in the seabed and ocean floor by the International Seabed Authority.</ce:para>
                        <ce:para id="p0285" view="all">However, despite greater awareness of the financial need, funding for SDG 14 remains largely dependent on voluntary contributions from states, NGOs and donors. Nevertheless, more financial sources have been identified in the last couple of years and more innovative ways of financing have been considered and implemented.</ce:para>
                        <ce:para id="p0290" view="all">Currently, the main current financial sources include: 1) public domestic sources and official development assistance, 2) multilateral ocean finance (Trust Funds and MDBs), 3) private ocean finance (domestic and international), 4) innovative finance and 5) philanthropy.</ce:para>

However, such funding resources are currently limited. Particular attention should be given to the role of the private sector, especially the area within the private sector that benefits from the oceans and to the role of philanthropy. Particular effort is also needed in order to change the narrative regarding funding for the oceans and make it more value oriented, for business and the public sector. MDBs and Trust Funds, as well as regional marine conservation organizations also have an important contribution to make. Each instrument has its own added value and through effective coordination their collective impact can be significant.</ce:para>

                        <ce:para id="p0350" view="all">The Analysis of the Ocean Conference Voluntary Commitments indicate that the three SDG 14 targets which received the least commitments were target 14.6 (prohibiting certain forms of fisheries subsidies) with only 3% of the commitments, target 14.3 (minimizing and addressing impacts of ocean acidification) with 6% of the commitments, and target 14.b (providing access to small-scale and artisanal fisheries to marine resources and markets) equally with 6% of the commitments. The targets which received most of the voluntary commitments were target 14.2 (sustainable management and protection of marine and coastal ecosystems), followed by target 14.1 (preventing and reducing marine pollution by 2025). Of note is also that target 14.1 seems to be receiving the majority of commitments from the private sector.</ce:para>
                        <ce:para id="p0355" view="all">It is assumed here that voluntary commitments also receive the necessary funding for their implementation and thus are indicative of the allocation of resources. Therefore, priority should be given to the funding gaps of <ce:bold>the least addressed targets</ce:bold> by the voluntary commitments. Also, attention should be paid to the timeframe gap: four targets have as timeframe the year 2020 (these are the commitments of promoting ecosystems sustainability (14.2), improving fishing practises (14.4), conserving at least 10% of coastal and marine areas, (14.5), and reducing fishing subsidies (14.6).</ce:para>
                        <ce:para id="p0360" view="all">In conclusion and taking into account views expressed by interviewees for this report, there is scope for leveraging further investment for small scale fisheries, while putting an end to subsidies can itself add significant resources for financing SDG 14. Researching and mitigating acidification and reducing marine pollution (including constructing sewage systems in developing countries) will also require considerable investment in the future.</ce:para>
                        <ce:para id="p0365" view="all">It goes without saying that the progress towards achieving the SDG 14 targets varies by regions and targets. Nevertheless, a general finding from the CBD reviews is that <ce:bold>across regions</ce:bold> similar progress has been made on the targets related to protected areas, while a similar lack of progress exists regarding fisheries, fisheries subsidies, and marine pollution. There is additionally a need to focus more on technology transfer and capacity building in all regions and to give greater assistance to the developing countries, particularly with issues of fisheries and marine pollution.</ce:para>
                        <ce:para id="p0370" view="all">In addition, while discussing the financial gap of SDG 14 with representatives of the ocean community, this paper identified another significant gap for this analysis: <ce:bold>the overall approach gap.</ce:bold> This is to say the fundamental change in the thinking and acting which is required for filling any other gaps for SDG 14. This change has to do with individually and collectively realizing the need to change the culture of production and consumption so that, for example, there could be more consumption of eco-labelled fish and more limited use of plastics.</ce:para>
                        <ce:para id="p0375" view="all">This change relates to the crucial enabling conditions for successful investment in SDG 14: a political leadership that cares about the oceans and good governance, as well as a set of convincing arguments for investing in the health of our oceans which resonate with the public and private sector. If so, more initiatives like the Seychelles blue bond, for example, will begin to materialize.</ce:para>
                        <ce:para id="p0380" view="all">Thirdly, overcoming the overall approach gap has to do with robust coordination at all levels: above all, coordination in marrying the ocean needs, especially of the developing world, with the investment opportunities of the donor community. Good project proposals from developing countries are needed to attract investment, and coordination will guarantee targeted investments that avoid duplications of efforts by the donor community.</ce:para>

                  <ce:para id="p0390" view="all">Like all cost-related studies, the present one also has inherent difficulties, like the lack of information at international, regional, but especially national level. Examples include lack of country by country assessments on costing requirements for the fulfilment of SDG 14 and the lack of country by country data on SDGs spending.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0395" view="all">Other inherent difficulties relate to SDG 14 indicators, which belong mostly to tier III (Tier 3: No internationally established methodology or standards are yet available for the indicator, but methodology/standards are being (or will be) developed or tested) and the relationship of different SDG 14 targets between them. As mentioned, in several occasions the same targets require the same actions to be fulfilled like in the case of SDG 14.4 and SDG 14.7 or SDG 14.3 and SDG 14a. What is more, SDG 14 relates closely in specific issues to other SDGs, like acidification to climate change. This study has kept focus on SDG 14 targets and did not include a cost/benefit analysis (though references are made in different parts of the report).</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0400" view="all">More specifically, this study relied heavily on the Convention on Biological Diversity findings on resources needed to fulfil the Aichi 2020 Targets and on the results of the UN Ocean Conference of 2017. Average estimates were provided with significant methodological limitations. These limitations are briefly discussed here (more discussion is found in the CBD report ‘Resourcing the Aichi Biodiversity Targets’ from 2012). They are reflected though in this study, taking into account that discussion, with an identification of uncertainty with a high, medium and low grade.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0405" view="all">Also, the CBD estimates conducted in 2012 were made for targets until 2020 and include estimates for targets that closely, but not exactly, correlate with SDG 14 targets. However, CBD and researchers continue to work with these estimates, considering them still relevant today, and until further analysis is conducted – preferably country-based – these are the best illustrative estimates. Bringing the 2012 amounts to 2019 values, in other words calculating the inflation, has not contributed to a considerable difference in overall estimates and in the CBD's calculations of costs initial investments and annual management costs have been accounted.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0410" view="all">For current expenditure on SDG 14 (US$ 25.5 billion) this study relied on the financial findings of the UN Ocean Conference. However, these should be used with caution, given that they only cover one third of the voluntary commitments made and are not an annual expenditure. Yet, the amount makes sense in the context of the more general biodiversity expenditure (US$52 billion per year).</ce:para>

                  <ce:para id="p0415" view="all">Achieving SDG 14 by 2030 will require at least six times the resources currently allocated. This study has identified some potential ways of leveraging additional resources following an analysis of gaps in targets, regions, financial sources and mechanisms. This study concludes with the following suggestions for better resourcing SDG 14:</ce:para>

                     <ce:para id="p0445" view="all">Global allocations for SDG 14 could profit considerably from better targeted spending. Firstly, funds would be freed by phasing out subsidies, which currently amount to US$20 billion. Secondly, mainstreaming SDG 14 targets into development and environmental fields, such as in the Blue Economy and in Climate Change, could help provide more varied and effective financial instruments for implementing SDG 14. Thirdly, rethinking the resource needs could lead to moving allocations to areas with greater impact.</ce:para>

                     <ce:para id="p0450" view="all">As part of the biodiversity funding, SDG 14 is funded mostly by domestic and international public sources (80% of the funding). In this respect, increases in the domestic resource mobilization and ODA have an important role to play in filling the SDG 14 financial gap. Currently around US$ 25 billion of global domestic revenues is dedicated to biodiversity and out of US$146 billion per year in ODA assistance to developing countries around US$8 billion is set aside to cover their biodiversity (terrestrial and marine) needs. With the right interventions there is potential to scale up these amounts.</ce:para>

Trust funds are effective financial mechanisms for the ocean's sustainability and most of them are in very biodiverse countries – a great potential advantage, given that these countries do not benefit as much as they should from biodiversity assistance. Additionally, regional efforts (such as the Regional Seas Programs and the Regional Fishery Bodies), which exhibit many good examples of coordinated marine conservation, should be further supported.</ce:para>
