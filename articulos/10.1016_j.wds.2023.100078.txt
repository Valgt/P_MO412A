                  The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) form the edifice of sustainable future and an inclusive growth. Indian state of Odisha has made significant progress in human development in the recent years, however, in comparison to several other Indian states it still lags behind. This study aims to discern the future prospects and challenges for achieving the SDGs in the state of Odisha and the policy support that currently exists or is needed in this context. To achieve this objective, an econometric analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between public social sector spending and the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) in order to assess the investment requirements for achieving the SDGs. The results of this study suggest that an increase in public spending on the social sector has a statistically significant effect on reducing the MPI and therefore could facilitate the achievement of the SDGs in the state. Given the substantial financial requirements and the current economic uncertainty the state might have to explore alternative means of financing. Better governance and higher efficiency in the implementation of policies/programs assume more importance in the current setting.

Table A1:    Sustainable Development Goals Odisha's Performance Programmes and Initiatives by Odisha state Government   SDG-1 No Poverty Decline in poverty from 57.2% in 2004–05 to 32.6% in 2011–12. Decline is confined to coastal regions and excludes tribal regions of north and south. (Press Note on Poverty Estimates, 2011-12) Swarna Jayanti Sahari Rozgar Yojana (SJSRY) (replaced by the new National Urban Livelihoods Mission (NULM)) and Urban Wage Employment Programme (UWEP). Integrated Action Plan (IAP) in 18 tribal and backward districts with assistance from central Government  SDG-2 Zero hunger Steady increase in food grain production and per capita consumption of vegetables in Odisha.• In 2014–15, production of food grains was 10,527 thousand metric tons, an increase of 25.92% over 2013–14.  • Besides rise in total food grain production, productivity and cropping intensity have also increased significantly.    Integrated Child Development Scheme, Anganwadi centers, Emergency Feeding Programme, National Food Security Act implementation Targeted Public Distribution Programme (TPDS). Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY), and Mid-day Meal Programme and Supplementary Nutrition Programme (SNP).  SDG-3 Good health and well being • Infant mortality ratio is substantially higher than the national average of 28.  • Maternal mortality has declined, from 303 in 2006 to 222 in 2013 but still higher than the national level of 167.    Launch of mobile health units, National Rural Health Mission and free Emergency Medical Ambulance Services. Sishu Abong Matru Mrityuhara Purna Narakaran Abhiyan (SAMPurNA) Yojana, operationalistion of SCNUs (special care newborn units), first referral units, kangaroo mother care (KMC) units, LaQshya programme  SDG-4 Quality education Literacy rate in Odisha has increased from 15.8% in 1951 to 72.9% in 2011. At this rate, 100% literacy may be achieved in the state by 2030. Tribal belt faces problems like inadequate number of teachers, and poor road connectivity between schools and villages and are lagging behind. Anvesha scheme targeting the children of BPL (below poverty line) Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe households and ensures they are admitted in private, English-medium schools. Financial assistance to Oriya-medium schools and grants-in-aid to the 867 eligible upper primary (ME) Schools as per the provisions of the Odisha Education Act 1969 and Odisha Education Payment of GIA Order 2004.  SDG-5 Gender Equality Difference in literacy rate between women (64%) and men (82%), Census 2011. Further, the share of women's employment in the organised sector is just 16%. Odisha Economic Survey 2014–15 Mandatory requirement for women representation in Panchayati Raj Institutions and a 33% reservation in state government departments and PSUs.  SDG-6 Clean water and sanitation The percentage coverage of households in the state using tap water, tube well water, and well water is very less and stands at 13.8%, 61.5%, and 19.5% respectively in 2011. In terms of sanitation, only 22% of households in Odisha had access to basic sanitation facilities in their houses (2011 Census). Of the rest 78% households, around 1.4% use public toilets. Others have to resort to open defecation, leading to communicable diseases. Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) has been implemented in all 30 districts in Odisha under the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan. By 2013–14, 58.1 per cent households, 100 per cent schools, and 100 per cent Anganwadis were covered under the programme.  SDG-7 Affordable and clean energy Odisha has done relatively well in providing access to affordable modern energy. Almost 93% villages had access to electricity in 2016. But Odisha lags behind in renewable energy which constitutes only 3%. Odisha Renewable Energy Development Agency (OREDA) has been working to increase the share of renewable energy to 10% of the total power mix by 2020.  SDG-8 Decent Work and Economic Growth Growth in per capita income has witnessed an annual increase of about 4%. –  SDG-9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure – State has been encouraging Public Private Partnerships (PPP) for infrastructure development.  SDG-11 Sustainable Cities and Communities Odisha is one of the least urbanised states in India with just 16.69 per cent of urban population. Government has focused on planned growth of cities by increasing budgetary allocation (Odisha Activities Report 2012; Infrastructure Policy 2001). AWAAS–scheme was launched for achieving the goal of ‘Housing for All’.  SDG-12 Responsible Consumption and Production Odisha has established seed hubs; developed stress resistant crop varieties; increased plantation in degraded land and formulated ecotourism policy and worked on reducing emission intensity by 20 to 25 per cent of 2005 levels. –  SDG-13 Climate Action – Odisha State Disaster Management Authority have identified the districts in high risk of wind and cyclone and high drought prone zone. The state also took an early initiative to formulate the State Climate Change Action Plan which focuses on curbing discharge of waste from thermal power plants.  SDG-14 Life Below Water With a long coastline, Odisha faces droughts, floods, and cyclones. World Bank-assisted Integrated Coastal Zone Management Project was implemented to protect the coastline and cyclone shelters were created. Odisha depends on rainfall for agricultural production. Rice, a water-dependant crop, is the main food crop, thus, food security is vulnerable to climate change impacts. –  SDG-15 Life on Land Odisha's per capita forest area at 0.14 ha is more than the national average. However, the quality of forestation is poor and degraded. The department of Forest and Environment is working towards protection, afforestation and extension of forest cover. –  SDG-16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions To ensure inclusiveness, female workforce participation is considered as an important indicator of women's involvement in economic activities and this is around 27.2 percent in 2011 for Odisha (Census of India 2011). However, female agricultural labourers are mostly marginal workers (66.9 per cent as per 2011 Census) with no social security net. For attaining social inclusiveness, state initiatives in this regard include women and child desks at police stations, CCTV surveillance, Women Commission, Child Rights Commission, State Commission for Persons with Disabilities, RTI Commission, etc., Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and System (CCTNS), legal aid to the poor and vulnerable, etc.  SDG-17 Partnerships for the Goals Odisha ranked 7th in ‘Ease of Doing Business’ index in 2015 in the country according to a DIPP-World Bank report. State PPP Policy has been formulated to leverage state and Central Government funds to support private investment State Innovation Council (SInC) has been set up for promotion of Innovation Ecosystem in the state    Sources: Government of India [23] ; Odisha State Disaster Management Authority website; World Bank [73] ; State Innovation Council (SInC) website; Government of Odisha [24] ; Government of Odisha [25] ; Government of Odisha [26]  a and b; Government of Odisha [30] ; Integrated Coastal Zone Management Project website; Odisha Economic Survey (various issues), Government of Odisha [27] , Government of Odisha [28] , Government of Odisha [29] , Government of Odisha [31] .

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) form the edifice of sustainable future and an inclusive growth. Indian state of Odisha has made significant progress in human development in the recent years, however, in comparison to several other Indian states it still lags behind. This study aims to discern the future prospects and challenges for achieving the SDGs in the state of Odisha and the policy support that currently exists or is needed in this context. To achieve this objective, an econometric analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between public social sector spending and the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) in order to assess the investment requirements for achieving the SDGs. The results of this study suggest that an increase in public spending on the social sector has a statistically significant effect on reducing the MPI and therefore could facilitate the achievement of the SDGs in the state. Given the substantial financial requirements and the current economic uncertainty the state might have to explore alternative means of financing. Better governance and higher efficiency in the implementation of policies/programs assume more importance in the current setting.   Keywords Sustainable development goals  Multidimensional poverty  Odisha  Public social sector expenditure    1 Introduction The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are United Nations global development goals and lay wider emphasis on poverty reduction and cover multiple aspects of development viz., environmental, economic and social [18 ,19] . The 17 SDGs are interlinked and are thus equally important in attaining all facets of human development [8 ,15,80] . A study by Bissio [10]  has depicted strong positive correlation between SDGs and Human Development Index (HDI). Although economic growth and human development have a positive and two-way causal relationship [43 ,50 ,67] , there is a growing consensus that economic growth alone is not a sufficient condition for human development [71] . Economic development needs an evaluation more in terms of enhancing human capabilities [62 ,63] . As per the trickle up theory, it is the government that needs to implement policies directly impacting and benefitting the poor. An increase in public investments and social sector spending on education, healthcare, social safety nets and environmental sustainability will help advance human development [58] . In the past, several studies have underpinned this correlation between economic growth, human development, and public expenditure and thereby realization of the SDGs [42 ,65] . The UN 2030 agenda states that “all countries and all stakeholders, acting in collaborative partnership, will implement this plan” [70] . India has been steadfastly working towards attainment of these goals and various stakeholders like local governments and civil societies have also been roped in for this cause (https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/ ). During the past two decades, India may have been able to uplift a large number of people out of poverty trap owing to faster rise in GDP, but the trickle-down approach has failed in achieving a more “inclusive growth” [56] . Similar was the case with MDGs where India's progress was not uniform across various goals [70] . India also ranks very low in UNDP Human Development Index and Global Hunger Index (admitting these indices have inherent weaknesses) than its neighbouring countries. Similar is the story for SDGs progress vis-à-vis its neighbouring countries [5] . Sachs et al. [80 , signify that India still remains in the “Aspirant” category in SDG goals like gender equality, zero hunger, poverty and education. For India, growth elasticity of poverty is around 0.8 in the period 2005 to 2012 [80]  and for other SDGs, growth elasticity though in positive direction is less in value [70] . One important factor for this is lesser spending by India on human development as compared to other countries. The country spends only 3.01 per cent of its GDP on health as against compared to 6 to 12 per cent by upper-middle-income and high-income countries [72] . Just a third of this health spending comes from public funds (1.3 per cent of GDP) while the rest is through private sources. Similar is the story for education where it spends just 3.3 per cent of GDP instead of the 6 per cent norm of UNESCO (Economic Survey, 2018-19). India is a vast nation with huge geographical, social, and cultural diversity and expectedly, various states in India may not be able to perform equally in SDGs goals. Within a state also, public expenditure remains skewed since most of the investment gets centred around bigger urban areas. The poor in India remain exceedingly dependant upon government services like education, health, water and sanitation and this requires focus on targeted social sector public spending. With rising regional disparities, the country needs to work towards a more balanced regional development [16] . NITI Aayog as nodal agency has developed a localized model of SDG Index to track the progress in adoption and implementation of SDGs at the state and local level. It involves developing indicator frameworks for states and the union territories, data ecosystem, review mechanism and ranking of districts on the basis of annual performance against the SDG targets. So far three editions of the index have been released – 2019, 2020 and 2021. The highest score for the index is 100 while the lowest score is 0. India demonstrated an improvement in the composite score which increased from 60 in 2020 to 66 in 2021, moving India to the “Front Runner” category. At state level, 13 states lie in the “Performer” category and 15 states are in “Front runner” category (NITI Aayog, 2021-22). In this context, current paper evaluates the challenges and opportunities towards SDGs attainment in the Indian state of Odisha. An attempt is also made to estimate social sector spending required for attainment of SDGs in Odisha by year 2030. The paper has following sections. Section 2  provides insights from the theoretical and empirical literature; Section 3  is regarding assessment of Odisha's state performance, Section 4  presents the approach and methodology; Section 5  reports and discusses the empirical results; Section 6  provides an overarching discussion; and finally, Section 7 is the concluding section.  2 Literature review 2.1 SDGs - country level implementation With the implementation period for the SDGs being from 2015 to 2030;today in year 2022, the world is almost halfway through this time period. Its time therefore to appraise and scrutinize SDG performance of countries across the globe. Realisation of sustainability targets has essentially been impacted by the choices and decisions around the areas identified for change; mainly so because often choices were made in favour of what was relatively easier to achieve as opposed to what had significant transformational potential for fulfilment of sustainability goals [1] . SDGs attainment had been an inherently complex challenge for the experts and policy formulators alike and to further the sustainable development agenda there is an inherent need for coming up with holistic integrated and country-level SDG strategies [74] . Various studies over the years have espoused different approaches to keep track of SDG implementation. Some studies in the past have pursued the country level progress in terms of relative performance through benchmarking with others [45,80]  while others have employed aggregation of data and developed SDG index [35] . While others have used micro-level data for SDG tracking [75] . Both the above-mentioned approaches have their advantages and drawbacks. One shortcoming of SDG index is that it provides a larger overview but omits granular details. At the same time use of sub-level data presents an indeterminate account of SDG implementation. Some researchers surmise that governments will find it progressively complicated and demanding to meet SDG goals at the country level. Another approach regarding SDG tracking has been t regarding scenario building and modelling [76] . Human environment and its linkages with natural environment have been examined by researchers as the ‘nexus’ approaches between the sustenance of livelihoods and the natural environment. The integrated frameworks thus emerged have encompassing measures for food, water and energy security. Such holistic approaches provide an opportunity for promoting community and individual level equity and contribute towards significant realistic achievement of SDGs [9 ,57] . A similar study for the Caribbean region looks at existing multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) and demonstrates association of policy alignment between the national policies and the MEAs. The analysis suggests that the interconnections to the MEAs are often neglected while formulating the national level SDG targets. There exists a significant opportunity to interlink and contextualize the MEAs while formulating national level policies [11] . Application of system dynamics-based family of models in the case of African nation of Tanzania demonstrated that the intervention in one specific area leads to impact on other SDG achievements as well. This highlights the potential use of systems thinking approach towards attainment of SDGs [14] .  2.2 Multi-dimensional poverty As the world moves towards greater inter-linkages and technology advancement, poverty still remains the most arduous issue [66] . Any development which eliminates a larger part of humanity unaffected constitute an inequitable and disparate society. According to Maslow's [47]  hierarchical theory, human needs are of two types - basic and higher needs SDGs not only focus on basic needs but on higher needs as well like safety, gender equality, empowerment, esteem and self-actualisation. Poverty which is a multidimensional concept, manifests itself in many forms like unemployment, indebtedness, the lack of fulfilment of basic needs etc. [52] . One important and comprehensive measure of human deprivation is the concept of multidimensional poverty index (MPI). In contrast with the conventional way of measuring poverty in its monetary sense, MPI integrates economic, social, and environmental aspects [46] . Poverty in its typical sense has been measured as lack of income [77]  or level of income earned per day by a person and its adequacy in meeting basic needs. World bank, for example uses 2.15 dollars per day at 2017 prices to measure extreme poverty. This indirect approach has been a popular way of measuring poverty across the world and makes international comparisons easier and uncomplicated. This unidimensional income approach to measure poverty has its serious limitations since it tries to circumspect a multidimensional concept like poverty. The policy makers are realising that income alone cannot measure poverty [60] ; measuring a single poverty line is not enough since consumption patterns vary across age, gender, health, location, climate, cultures, societies and countries. The prices of same goods may not be uniform across the world. Poverty affects the ability to procure basic sustenance, getting access to healthcare, education and employment [13 ,38] . At same level of income, state provided facilities like clean drinking water, education, sanitation, health can impact the level of satisfaction of basic needs [62] . Due to these serious shortcomings, Human Development Report (1997) and World Development Report (2000) introduced poverty as a multi-dimensional concept. The MPI allows for international comparisons. Alkire and Foster [2]  through the multidimension concept of poverty brought together the qualitative (literacy, physical security) and quantitative data (income levels). Both the unidimensional and multidimensional approaches of measuring poverty are complementary in nature. Many studies [6]  have linked the concept of MPI with indirect or counting method of poverty and recommended a more holistic method to measuring poverty. The MDGs and SDGs have highlighted the multidimensional concept of poverty since 2000. The UNDP and the OPHI at Oxford had jointly developed global multidimensional poverty index (MPI) using three dimensions, viz., education, health and living standard, and ten indicators [69] .  2.3 Social sector expenditure and human development Several studies in the past have looked at the relationship between social sector spending and economic growth [34 ,40 ,55 ,65]  Studies by Joshi [40]  and Panchamukhi [78]  have examined these trends in public expenditure and impact on human development. Other studies have investigated that how social sector spending on various SDGs like education, health, sanitation, clean drinking water etc. results in higher human development leading to more holistic societies [42 ,64] . These studies postulate that achievement of SDG goals require significant increase in social sector expenditure [80] . This requires a large-scale investment which goes beyond the fiscal bandwidth that the governments have for the implementation of SDGs and especially taxing for developing countries (DCs) like India. International Monetary Fund in 2019 along with the UN Sustainable Solutions Network (SDSN) stated that the incremental financial costs of achieving the SDGs for developing world will lead to a gap which is beyond the means of these countries [20] . Due to COVID-19 and Ukraine war, DCs have been put in a very deleterious situation s in terms of achievement of SDGs. Economic setbacks due to pandemic are estimated to have a two-year delay impact on the administration of SDGs [80] . In research focusing on the funding and finance gaps for SDGs of the EU countries, Lagoarde-Segot [44]  opine that the traditional approaches to financing SDGs which were based on Loanable Fund Theory (LFT) need to make way for the simpler financing mechanisms, which would ensure a smoother flow of requisite finance for SDG related investments. The study also makes a slight digression into the real resource (manpower, technology and equipment) availability to tackle the climate challenges and achieving SDGs. While examining the efficacy of the government expenditure frameworks for achieving SDGs in Nigeria, Osuji and Nwani [53]  observe that the social SDGs which are health and education related, respond positively to the government expenditure framework.   3 An assessment of Odisha's SDGs performance Odisha moved up by 3 points and now stands at 61 points [51] . In two SDG goals i.e., 13 and 14 climate action and life below water, Odisha's score is highest in the country. Odisha has been recognised for its disaster management preparedness by various UN agencies [72] . By promoting sustainable usage of energy through LED bulbs, the state was able to save 120.07 tonnes of CO2 /1000 population as compared to national average of 28.04 tonnes. In terms of SDG-14, it has been focussing on improving shore water quality [51] . In a first ever in the country, Odisha has introduced a Climate Budget in the year 2021 [31] . The state also commenced a State Action Plan in the year 2010 for climate change and further revised it for 2018–23 (Climate Change Cell, Odisha, 2018). In another innovative move, state government initiated a separate “SDG Budget” in 2022 for the first time in India. Regarding SDG implementation, state has special focus on SDG 4, SDG 10 and SDG 2 (Odisha Economic Survey, 2022). Odisha's score is high in environment, climate action, land and water, but low in SDGs on poverty, hunger, and inequality (As per [51] ,). One plausible reason for this low score is ddevelopment remains highly inequitable within the state with southern and western parts having much higher number of poor people [17] . Agriculture remains the mainstay occupation since growth in industry and service sector is slow [54] .   Odisha's performance as compared to the national average on human development, poverty headcount and multidimensional poverty indicators is lacking. Narrowing of these gaps require cconsistent efforts by the state. The present current study examines Odisha's key initiatives and challenges in attainment of the 17 SDGs and details are provided in Table A.1 . In terms of SDG-1, Odisha had exhibited the sharpest decline in poverty from 57.2 per cent in 2005 to 32.6 per cent in 2012 which is a 24.6 percentage points reduction (Press Note on Poverty Estimates, 2011-12). This being the highest decline in poverty amongst major states of India, Odisha could not sustain its performance and today it is placed amongst the nine poorest states of India in 2021 as per the Global MPI 2022 report (UND). In case of SDG-2 and SDG-3, IMR ratio (infant mortality) in the state has shown a drop to 36 from 40 in 2018 (Statistical Report, RGI, 2020) which is the highest relative decline amongst all states since 2005 till 2020. But despite this consistent drop in IMR, Odisha ranks fourth in India. In SDG-4 the state raised the literacy rate from 15.8 per cent in 1951 to 77.3 per cent in 2021 (NSSO 2021), yet it could not make amongst the top ten performers in India. Even this rise in literacy rate does not reflect in the tribal belt of Odisha which has inadequate number of teachers and a poor road connectivity between schools and villages [7] . For SDG-5 i.e., women's equal rights in economic resources, and SDG-6 related to clean drinking water and sanitation facilities; Odisha has not exhibited much progress. Performance is better for SDG-7 goal of providing access to affordable modern energy with almost 93 per cent villages having access to electricity in 2016. In terms of SDG-9 goal, state has been encouraging Public Private Partnerships (PPP) for infrastructure development. With respect to SDG- 11, Odisha is one of the least urbanized states in India with just 16.69 per cent of urban population. Responsible production and consumption are the 12th SDG goal [51] . Odisha is making various efforts in this direction as outlined in Table A.1 . Odisha's performance in SDG 13 and 14 has been favourable and for SDG-16 Odisha government has introduced some new programs. Its noteworthy that SDGs are interlinked and therefore require collaborative approach by various stakeholders like government, private sector, and civil society. SDG-17 aims to strengthen the global partnership for sustainable development and towards this end, State PPP Policy is focused on mobilizing state and central government funds to support private investment.  4 Methodology 4.1 Area of study Odisha covers approximately 5% of land area of India. It has 30 administrative districts. Odisha is especially susceptible to vagaries of climate affecting its economy adversely [49] . Odisha is rich in natural resources., despite that it is more of an agrarian and rural economy (Planning and Convergence Department, Odisha, 2021). It has high incidence of multi-dimensional poverty at 29.35% [51] . Agriculture after seven decades of planning, remains the primary occupation of majority of people. Owing to the skewed landholding pattern, ownership of assets and facilities, climate change and vagaries of nature like recurrent cyclones in Odisha, small and marginal farmers face acute poverty.  4.2 Sources of data For the present study, we used data from Government of India [23]  and Odisha Economic Survey (2021 and 2022). For the purpose of the analysis state level data on public expenditure on the social sector were collected from the RBI and estimates of MPI were used from a paper by Alkire et al. [4] .  4.3 Conceptual framework SDGs are closely interrelated with human development and social sector expenditure is one of the most crucial factors for human development [80] . The current study analyses this relationship between social sector expenditure and SDGs using non-income indicators for the state of Odisha during the period 2006 to 2030. Poverty, as traditionally measured in terms of lack of income, defines poverty in a very narrow sense and fails to capture the multidimensional aspect of well-being [79] . ThusiIn the last two decades, there has been a gradual shift towards usage of non-income indicators and measures for human development [36] . One such indicator is the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) introduced by UNDP Human Development Report. MPI measures multiple deprivations in various aspects of human development and derives its theoretical underpinnings from Sen's capabilities approach ([59 ,61]  and [62] ). The MPI and SDGs align together because they both aim at integrating and balancing economic, social, and environmental aspects of sustainable development and reducing human deprivations [3] . Increased public spending on social sector (education, health, water, sanitation, agriculture and anti-poverty) affects MPI positively, and thereby achievement of SDGs. SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are specifically linked to MPI, since these goals are related to different dimensions of human deprivation. To study this relationship, we took a two-step approach. Initially the relationship between social sector expenditure and MPI was estimated and then in the second step, this estimate was used for finding out the expenditure requirements for achieving the SDGs.  4.4 Multidimensional poverty index (MPI) UNDP developed the concept of MPI for its Human Development Reports in the year 2010. By 2018, through various few amendments, MPI was made more compatible with the UN's 2030 Agenda, making it a significant tool for SDG monitoring. Besides UNDP's MPI, there are several other methodologies that measure MPI like the EU-2020 official poverty measure, “Bristol” methodology and UNICEF's Multidimensional Overlapping Deprivation Analysis (MODA) and IFAD Multidimensional Poverty Assessment Tool (MPAT). However, of these, it is the UNDP - MPI that remains the most broadly used non-monetary measure of poverty [21] .) The present study uses MPI as a measure of poverty because income-based measure of poverty is insufficient in capturing a complex and multiple dimensional concepts like poverty. Poverty affects poor people in several aspects like health, education, poor quality of work, violence and abuses, lack of empowerment, poor hygiene and sanitation [33] . The MPI methodology can be, adapted to national context. This makes MPI especially useful in monitoring other SDG Indicators. The current study uses MPI estimates from a paper by Alkire et al. [4]  using Alkire and Foster [2]  methodology. The Alkire and Foster (AF) methodology is based on Foster-Greer-Thorbecke (FGT) poverty measures. AF methodology has several advantages that make it useful in estimating poverty. For example, if poverty levels in a large and diverse country like India are calibrated using a single deprivation, it would lead to obscure results, where inflated poverty rates might be calculated. The AF methodology uses a cut-off counting method to identify poor. For each indicator, this cut off is applied and then a sum total of all indicators is taken to find out the deprivation score for each individual and to identify multidimensional poverty. AF is a powerful tool for policy makers since it not only provides a measure of poverty but also gives clarity about its composition and distribution. This method complements the measures of income poverty. Also, in case of India, AF is adaptable and compatible to the present data sets. This method is able to present a correct measure without the problem of either overestimation or underestimation [41]  It also provides the flexibility to logically select indicators which are suitable in a particular national context thus allowing tailored national poverty measures. The AF not only allows the decomposition of poverty in terms of geography, ethnicity or any other sub-groups but also depicts the type of deprivation within the indicators as to which dimension/indicator is contributing to poverty. In the AF methodology MPI is constructed by multiplying the percentage of the population who are poor and the average percentage of the weighted indicators that poor people experience (intensity). This helps in identifying people suffering from acute poverty [51]   4.5 The Alkire-Foster methodology At the core of the MPI is the Alkire-Foster (AF) methodology. As suggested by the existing literature, three dimensions of acute Multidimensional poverty were studied viz. health, education, and standard of living comprising of ten indicators to measure the status of multidimensional poverty. Education plays an important role in making people skilled and productive by allowing active participation of individuals in social, economic, and political system. The second dimension of health includes the nutritional status of the individuals and child mortality indicators. The living standard reflects the quality of life of the individuals in terms of basic amenities like housing etc. As mentioned above the dimensions studied are Health, Education and Standard of living. Different indicators are used to measure these three dimensions and construction of an aggregate score using the Alkire and Foster methodology (2007). Equal weightage is assigned to each of these dimensions and further to this within each dimension, each indicator is also equally weighted.MPI  =  H × A     Where, - H  denotes headcount ratio or incidence i.e., percentage of people who are poor  - A  denotes intensity which is the average share of indicators in which poor people are deprived    It is evident that any reduction in H or A will lead to reduction in MPI. For identifying a person as multidimensionally poor it is important that a person is deprived in a combination of indicators whose weighted sum exceeds 30% of total deprivations. If a person is deprived in clean water, electricity and nutrition only, then to calculate the deprivation score, we add 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/18 = 7/18. This person will be considered MPI poor since his score is larger than one-third. Social sector spending on SDGs like education, health, sanitation, clean drinking water etc. leads to human development leading to more holistic societies. Odisha has focused well on this aspect. Per capita social sector expenditure (in 2012 prices) showed an annual increase of about 13 percent between 2006 and 2016, which has led to better human development outcomes in the state (Odisha Economic Survey 2016).   5 Results and discussion 5.1 Public expenditure requirements for achieving the SDGs The current study estimates the relationship between per capita public social sector expenditure and MPI (Table 2  ) using a regression (OLS) and then uses this relationship to estimate the expenditure requirements for achieving the SDGs (reduction in MPI) in Odisha. The dependant variable used in the analysis is the natural log of state MPI while the independent variable is the natural log of per capita social sector expenditure of the state. To capture the effects of different time periods (2005–06 and 2015–16) a dummy variable was used. The results (Table 3  ) indicate a statistically significant negative relationship between per capita public social sector expenditure and MPI, implying that public spending on the social sector could reduce deprivations (MPI) and thus could help in achieving the SDGs.  5.2 Estimates of expenditure requirements and multidimensional poverty index (MPI) for Odisha As discussed earlier an econometric analysis was conducted for estimating the investment requirements for SDGs—1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9, which could be linked to social sector spending. This analysis forms the basis for making future projections of MPI and thus the attainment of the above SDGs. Assumptions about growth in per capita social sector expenditure and population are based on past trends, with actual values of social sector expenditure till 2021–22, the latest available year. Three scenarios were constructed for per capita public social sector expenditure growth from 2022-23: 10 per cent (below the trend), 13 per cent (trend between 2005-06 and 2015–16) and 16 per cent (above the trend). Fig. 1   shows the relationship between per capita social sector spending and MPI under the three scenarios. Per capita social spending showed an increasing trend between 2015-16 and 2018–19, however, since 2018–19 it has remained almost stagnant. The COVID pandemic seems to have affected social sector spending with implications for the MPI. Despite the current slowdown in spending the analysis reveals that under all the scenarios MPI declines significantly to levels close to zero by 2030, which is comparable to the better performing states as well as to high income countries. The main implication of these results is that growth in public social sector expenditure is crucial for achieving the human development goals (SDGs) in the state. Projections of social sector expenditure and MPI are presented in Table 4  . The analysis reveals that MPI could be substantially reduced if past trends in social spending growth continue through 2030. The estimated future investment requirements (between 2022 and 2030) are INR 7506, 8773 and 10,255 billion for the three scenarios respectively. A higher level of spending could reduce it further and achieve the SDGs 1 to 9. But meeting the expenditure requirements will be an uphill task. Odisha's MPI in 2030, estimated between 0.03 and 0.04 across the scenarios, is comparable to the current MPIs of states like Delhi, Goa, Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab. However, to achieve the MPI of Kerala, the best performing state, Odisha has to do much better. In this context it must be noted that this analysis considers only the effect of public social sector expenditure on MPI, in reality other factors also influence MPI and therefore better outcomes can be achieved, which may help reaching the targets for these SDGs, if other factors improve as well. The importance of public social sector expenditure on achieving SDGs has been documented in previous studies as well. According to Mate et al. [48]  state social sector expenditure has contributed to the SDGs in the past and inter-state variations amongst states in terms of both social sector expenditures and outcomes are narrowing. The authors estimate that to achieve health and education related SDG targets additional financing requirement is INR 12.1 trillion and 53.6 trillion respectively As mentioned above our analysis is mainly applicable for SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9, and additional investments are required for achieving the other SDGs. However, the present analysis includes SDGs like Poverty (SGD 1) and Hunger (SDG 2) and achieving the targets related to these SDGs could lead to the achievement of other SDGs due to the cross-cutting nature of these goals. Thus, the expenditure requirements for achieving the SDGs are substantial and developing an appropriate technical and financing framework to achieve the SDGs is crucial. The state is committed towards all round development and there are several public initiatives geared towards achieving this objective. Mission Shakti has provided economic opportunities to more than seventy lakh women; the Krushak Assistance for Livelihood and Income Augmentation (KALIA) scheme has empowered the farming communities; Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojana has brought about remarkable change in access to modern health facilities to the weaker sections; Mo School and Mo College Abhijan aim to promote inclusive and quality education, and under the ambitious 5T Programme a series of initiatives for boosting skill development have been launched (Odisha Economic Survey, 2022). The state is encouraging greater participation of women in vocational and technical education. The state government initiated a special scheme ‘SUDAKHYA’ to further the cause of female education and increasing their enrolment into Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs). As part of Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin), Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) is being implemented in rural Odisha since 2020–21 with the aim to achieve open defecation free status. Finally, the state has enacted the Odisha Right to Public Services Act (ORTPSA) which ensures time bound and transparent delivery of public services through a legal framework (Odisha Economic Survey, 2022). In another new initiative, Odisha government revised the Odisha SDG Indicator Framework' (OSIF) to align them with the national indicator framework. OSIF was launched in 2019 and helps in monitoring and thereby improving effectiveness of SDG efforts at the ground level [32] . In the aftermath of COVID the state has further enhanced its focus on the social sector. The social sector accounted for the major share of developmental expenditure in the financial year 2022. Within the social sector, education, health, and water supply and sanitation have been given higher allocations (Odisha Economic Survey, 2022). However, there is scope for reorganizing social sector expenditure to achieve better outcomes. In the context of education, for instance, there is a need to focus on non-salary expenditure keeping in view the Sarva Shikhsha Abhiyan (SSA) model (Ministry of Human Resource Development Department, 2011). With regard to health expenditure the Ayushman Bharat National Health Protection Scheme could complement state level initiatives with insurance coverage [22] . In order to foster sustainable development Odisha needs to make better use of its comparative advantage. Odisha being a mineral rich state must focus on value addition rather than being solely a supplier of raw materials (metals and minerals). Further, to address regional disparities there is a need to promote industrialization in the backward areas. Better governance is also a key requirement for achieving the SDGs. There is a need for all departments of the state government to adopt a more collaborative approach in implementing the SDGs along with capacity building. The state needs to focus on revamping its disaster management infrastructure due to its high susceptibility to natural calamities [37] . Another important change that Odisha needs to bring is to localize SDGs through seamless execution of new or existing development programs at all levels of governance. Towards this end there is need to generate more awareness for SDGs at the village, panchayat, block and district levels [39] . The state can garner and mobilize youth, civil society and private sector support for this goal. The SDGs form a base as global framework for policymakers to steer towards the 2030 Agenda [12] . The above analysis shows that Odisha has made noteworthy progress in economic growth, poverty reduction, and human development in recent years and increased per capita public expenditure on the social sector is likely to have played an important role in this context. The positive correlation between social sector expenditure and attainment of SDGs provides a basis to further such investments. A recent research by Lancet has found that over 75 per cent Indian districts are off target for crucial SDG indicators like access to basic services, poverty, stunting growth of children, anaemia, domestic violence, child marriage and tobacco consumption. These districts are concentrated in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, and Odisha [68] . This makes it imperative that Odisha takes a long-term developmental approach to achieve SDGs rather than just focusing on short-term relief measures. The analysis indicates that much higher levels of resources are required to achieve the SDGs by 2030. Recent trends in public spending on social services show that it may be difficult to meet the expenditure requirements from public sources alone. The after effects of the pandemic and the current geopolitical situation is further likely to put a strain on the availability of public resources in the coming years. Therefore, the role of the private sector and bilateral/multilateral mechanisms to meet the financial requirements of the SDGs need to be explored. Finally, it is important to look at other factors, for instance digitalization, that could influence the achievement of the SDGs.   6 Conclusion In Odisha the per capita social sector expenditure (in 2011–12 prices) showed an annual increase of about 13 percent between 2005-06 and 2015–16 which contributed to the decline in Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) during this period. In this study three scenarios for per capita public social sector expenditure growth were constructed with the help of a regression model to make future projections of MPI. The growth rates are 10 per cent (below the trend), 13 per cent (actual growth between 2005-06 and 2015–16) and 16 per cent (above the trend) respectively for the three scenarios. The results show that under all three scenarios MPI in Odisha showed a noteworthy decline to levels close to zero by 2030 which clearly implies that public social sector expenditure could play an important role in achieving the human development goals (SDGs) in the state. The estimated future investment requirements between 2022 and 2030 are INR 7506, 8773 and 10,255 billion which translates to USD 94, 110 and 128 billion respectively, assuming current exchange rate, for the three scenarios respectively. To achieve all the SDGs additional expenditure is required as our analysis is mainly related to SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Thus, the expenditure requirements for achieving the SDGs are substantial and developing an appropriate financing framework to achieve the SDGs is crucial. Given the current economic uncertainty the state may have to explore alternative sources of funding for the SDGs. The state must also streamline the existing policies/programs and promote better governance and efficiency for achieving the SDGs.
