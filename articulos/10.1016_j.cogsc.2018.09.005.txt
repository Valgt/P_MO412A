Editorial  Editorial Overview: UN Sustainable Development Goals: How can sustainable/green chemistry contribute? There can be more than one approach Tom Welton ∗   Faculty of Natural Sciences, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, UK Faculty of Natural Sciences Imperial College London South Kensington Campus London SW7 2AZ UK   ∗ Corresponding author: Welton, Tom   Edited by Tom Welton   As part of the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), sustainable development was defined as that which enabled the current generation to meet its own needs, without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs [1] . Following this line of thought one can then define Sustainable Chemistry  as the implementation of the idea of sustainability in the production of chemical products and the application of chemistry and chemical products to enable sustainable development. Green Chemistry , generally described as the reduction or elimination of the use or generation of hazardous substances in the design, manufacture and application of chemical products [2] , also fits this definition. While this concept is elegant in its initial simplicity, we quickly find ourselves questioning things such as what is a ‘need’, is this simple subsistence or achieving a particular lifestyle, are everyone's needs the same, or how can we predict what the needs of future generations might be? For example, who would have said 50 years ago that indium would be a vital part of modern communications and its limited supply could be a risk to these? Yet without indium tin oxide the touch sensitive screens that enable modern smart phones could not function. Are these something that we would now call a basic need? They are certainly an integral part of many people's lives. In 2016, the MDGs were replaced by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [3] . These include social, economic and technical development and are:Image 1     For some of these the contribution from Green and/or Sustainable Chemistry is obvious, such as Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation, Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy, and Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. There are others to which Green and/or Sustainable Chemistry can contribute strongly, such as Goal 2: Zero Hunger through agrochemistry, Goal 3: Good Health and Well-Being for People through consumer products and pharmaceuticals, Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth and Goal 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure through responsible commercial development, Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, Goal 14: Life Below Water and Goal 15: Life on Land through pollution reducing technologies, and Goal 13: Climate Action through decarbonizing technologies. Chemists can also make contributions to the other goals, such as Goal 4: Quality Education and Goal 5: Gender Equality through how we deliver education and organise our own businesses. I doubt that there are many other subjects or groups of practitioners that can make such wide-ranging contributions to the SDGs as Chemistry and Chemists. It also seems to me that this is more important than whether these fit with any preconceived definition of what we decide to call Sustainable and/or Green Chemistry. With such a wide range of potential interventions, it would be surprising to find that there was only one view of what the greatest priorities are and how these should be addressed. Also, one can only view the world from the point of one's own experiences and interests. This generates many different perspectives. These should not be set against each other in a competition to decide which is somehow ‘right’ or ‘wrong’, but rather we should learn from the perspectives of others to develop our own ideas and actions. This stands at the heart of how this special edition has come into being. Each contributor was asked to provide an article with the same title UN Sustainable Development Goals: how can sustainable/green chemistry contribute?  The authors from industry were asked to add a qualification saying the industry from which the piece was written. The authors were encouraged to give their opinions and because of this the editing was very light-touch. Our academic contributors took gave a range of views. Martyn Poliakoff, Peter Licence and Michael George (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452223617301189 ), gave a challenge to us as researchers to rethink how we build our own laboratories and to set a bold quantitative target to reduce the amount of chemical(s) used to achieve a given effect by a factor of 2 every five years. Paul Anastas (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S245222361830021X ) expressed his concern that the SDGs compartmentalised individual areas too much and called for a more integrated systems approach. Mark Burgman, Mike Tennant, Nikolaos Voulvoulis, Karen Makuch and Kaveh Madani (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452223618300191 ) pointed out the need to include communities in determining acceptable outcomes and to not only think of technological possibilities. Paulina Pavez, Jessica Honores, Daniela Millan and Mauricio Isaacs (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452223617301219 ) emphasised the need for research in Sustainable Chemistry to support the needs and opportunities of the local economy. It is only by commercial production that chemical products and their use impacts upon people's lives and the environment, and it is changes in how chemicals are made and used that will lead to a more sustainable future. Hence, I felt that it was particularly important to hear from those in industry. All of the companies who agreed to take part in this special edition (there were others who did not) have made commitments to contributing to meeting the SDGs and all have at least part of their innovation agenda directed towards this. This takes different forms for the different industries within which each company operates. For Syngenta (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452223617300871 ) it is important that their crop protection products are made using green chemistry routes and that they enable improved agricultural practices. L'Oréal (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452223618300373 ) have a commitment to achieve 100% of its products bringing an environmental or social benefit by 2020, with particular emphasis on renewable raw materials. Roquette (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452223617301001 ) is a maker of plant-based ingredients that uses the Principles of Green Chemistry to think about how it makes its products and targets its solutions for end users on 3 of the SDGs: Good health & wellbeing (Goal 3), Clean water & sanitation (Goal 6) and Responsible consumption & production at our customers and/or consumers (Goal 12). Johnson Matthey is a company that provides catalysis solutions to other parts of the chemicals industry. Sean Axon, David James (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452223618300208 ) have pointed out that while the chemical industry has positively embraced the SDGs there is a need for it to go further and to apply them to drive innovation if it is to deliver the breakthroughs needed to address the global challenges highlighted in the goals. Another important point that I was trying to bring out is that the development of any area of science is a discussion between practitioners. Hence, once all of the articles had been received, they were circulated among the other authors and all were invited to provide an additional follow-up contribution having read these. I would like to thank all of the contributors for the openness with which they joined in this somewhat unusual exercise. It took a good degree of intellectual courage on their parts to do so. I would also like to thank Joanna Aldred, the Editorial Manager for Current Opinion in Green and Sustainable Chemistry , for allowing us to experiment with this unusual format. I hope and believe that readers will find this novel aspect interesting. My own view is that all of us have a responsibility to work towards a more sustainable future. We should make those contributions that we can with the skills and knowledge that we have, regardless of whether we consider ourselves to be working in Green and/or Sustainable Chemistry or not. I am an optimist. In my years working in this area, I have met many people of great intellect and skill who are committed to a more sustainable future and I see this becoming an ever bigger issue for my students. These will solve the challenges that we face now and those that we haven't yet faced. What other choice do we have?   References 1 C.G.
