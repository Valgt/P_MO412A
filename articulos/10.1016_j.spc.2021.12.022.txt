                  The unprecedented increase in global demands of vegetable oil and biofuel production has spurred oil palm cultivation in the tropics that resulting in deforestation and biodiversity loss. This study aims to explore the potential if oil palm agroforestry can enhance soil quality, crop yield, and ecosystem carbon stock in northeast India. A 3-year field experiment was conducted in an oil palm agroforestry with maize (T1), turmeric (T2), and pineapple (T3) and compared with monoculture oil palm (T0) to identify the best-performing systems. The T0 site demonstrated higher oil palm growth and aboveground biomass (0.22 Mg tree−1). However, T3 site showed the highest crop (15.6 Mg ha−1) and intercrop (10.8 Mg ha−1) yield, and ecosystem carbon stock (55.44 Mg C ha−1). The study highlights significance of oil palm agroforestry in increasing crop yield and ecosystems carbon stock at the degraded jhum land in northeast India. The findings also provide an empirical basis to achieve land degradation neutrality and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals through oil palm agroforestry.

Editor: Dr. Moritz von Cossel The unprecedented increase in global demands of vegetable oil and biofuel production has spurred oil palm cultivation in the tropics that resulting in deforestation and biodiversity loss. This study aims to explore the potential if oil palm agroforestry can enhance soil quality, crop yield, and ecosystem carbon stock in northeast India. A 3-year field experiment was conducted in an oil palm agroforestry with maize (T1), turmeric (T2), and pineapple (T3) and compared with monoculture oil palm (T0) to identify the best-performing systems. The T0 site demonstrated higher oil palm growth and aboveground biomass (0.22 Mg tree−1 ). However, T3 site showed the highest crop (15.6 Mg ha−1 ) and intercrop (10.8 Mg ha−1 ) yield, and ecosystem carbon stock (55.44 Mg C ha−1 ). The study highlights significance of oil palm agroforestry in increasing crop yield and ecosystems carbon stock at the degraded jhum  land in northeast India. The findings also provide an empirical basis to achieve land degradation neutrality and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals through oil palm agroforestry.

However, the rapidly changing climate and increased anthropogenic pressure have substantially reduced the forest area through deforestation and land use change (IPCC, 2019 ). It is estimated that nearly 420 million hectares of forests have been lost due to deforestation since 1990 and the rate of forest loss was estimated at 10 M ha yr−1  between 2015 and 2020 (FAO, 2020 ). Intensive agriculture practices such as cattle ranching, cultivation of soya bean, and oil palm (Elaeis guineensis  Jacq.) continue to be the major drivers of forest loss and account for 40% of deforestation (FAO and UNEP, 2020 ). These adverse changes simultaneously resulted in a loss of biodiversity, ecosystem C pool, and climate change. To reverse these losses, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs) underlined the increasing efforts for sustainable management of terrestrial ecosystems to halt land degradation and biodiversity loss (United Nations, 2016 ). In addition, it is emphasized to restore degraded lands in such a way that it can deliver essential ecosystem services and provide food security to all (IRP 2019, FAO, 2020 ). In India, forest restoration and large-scale plantation have been carried out to compensate for forest losses and increase the terrestrial C pool (Forest Survey of India, 2019 ). Nevertheless, the promotion of agroforestry is one of the potential options to resolve land-use and climate change issues (Khasanah et al., 2020 ). From the farmer's perspective, agroforestry can help diversify the product outputs and enhance crop yield and therefore, will be more beneficial than conventional agriculture. Moreover, these systems may ensure food security, create additional C sinks and help sustainable management of degraded ecosystems (Feintrenie et al., 2010 ). Agriculture (16%) is the second-largest land use after forests (65%) in northeast India and 86% of the agricultural land is under shifting cultivation (jhum ) cultivation (Mishra and Francaviglia, 2021 ). About 30,000 workforces in Mizoram are engaged in low productivity jhum  practices and about 39% of the total agricultural land is owned by smallholders (Government of Mizoram, 2017 ). Land use statistics (2015–16) indicate that 19,851 ha of land are under jhum  cultivation in Mizoram (Zothansanga and Beingachhi, 2019 ). The government of Mizoram (India) under the New Land Use Policy, 2011 have implemented agroforestry, oil palm plantation, and mixed farming as viable project prototype in smallholders land to fulfill livelihood needs and reverse land degradation caused by shifting cultivation . Although shifting cultivation has been criticized heavily for its negative impacts on the terrestrial ecosystems, it is an extensive and critical part of the larger biodiverse agricultural system of northeast India linking food security, ecological sustainability, and culture (Bose, 2019 ; Thong et al., 2020 ). Oil palm is an economically important plant for the food and cosmetic industries (Barcelos et al., 2015 ; Corley and Tinker, 2008 ) and it is increasingly recognized for biofuel feedstock to offset greenhouse gasses (GHGs) emission (Reijnders and Huijbregts, 2008 ). It is estimated that oil palm covers approximately 17 M ha of land and most of them come from tropical forests (Pirker et al., 2016 ). In India, against the potential area of 1.9 M ha, nearly 17% area was planted with oil palm till 2019 (ICAR, 2019 ). Cultivation of oil palm in degraded land is considered as among the best strategy for biofuel production and emission savings (Choo et al., 2011 ; Singh et al., 2018 ). The promotion of oil palm cultivation has been carried out not only to enhance climate regulatory services but also to provide an alternative source of energy and contribute to economic development and rural livelihood (Feintrenie et al., 2010 ; Wicke et al., 2008 ). However, expansion of oil palm plantation has largely been argued because of its negative impacts on biological diversity, GHGs emission, and reduce ecosystem services in long run (IUCN, 2018 ; Koh and Wilcove, 2008 ; Meijaard et al., 2018 ). Therefore, sustainable cultivation of oil palm and its inclusion in the agroforestry systems may potentially increase additional socioeconomic and ecosystem services and help reduce its negative impact on the ecosystem. The long gestation of oil palm (3–4 years) to start producing fruit is a major problem for the smallholder farmers who invest money and labor in deriving income from these plantations. Therefore, intercropping in oil palm especially during the juvenile phase could be rewarding to the farmers in mitigating these costs during the gestation period. Intercropping of oil palm with a variety of food crops (Okyere et al., 2014 ; Sahoo et al., 2015 ; Tonye et al., 2005 ) and with cocoa, black pepper, and other spices (Khasanah et al., 2020 ) has been investigated in different parts of the world. The complexity of intercropping can cause more stress to the ecosystem if the choice of crop, cropping technique, and management practice are not proper (Zemp et al., 2019 ). Therefore, proper research should be undertaken to nullify the perceived negative aspects of intercropping on oil palm production. We hypothesize that oil palm agroforestry may provide more ecosystem services than the conventional monoculture oil palm plantation. Therefore, the objectives of the study were to (i) investigate the effect of juvenile oil palm agroforestry on the soil quality, plant growth, and crop yield, and (ii) estimate the changes in ecosystem C stock under different agroforestry systems along with the plantation age. We anticipated that oil palm agroforestry at the juvenile stage may be an effective agroforestry technique to provide better crop (intercrop) yield and a feasible project prototype to attain the sustainable development goals.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study site The study was conducted in the agroforest ecosystems of two bordering districts (Mamit and Aizawl) of Mizoram, northeast India. The area has a hilly topography and is geographically located between 23°10′ – 24°30′N and 92°10′ – 93°10′ E at an elevation ranged from 152 to 2135 m above the mean sea level (Fig. 1  ). Mizoram state covers an area of 21,087 km2  and is located between Myanmar and Bangladesh. The area experienced humid subtropical monsoon climate and temperature ranges between 8 °C and 24 °C in the winter and from 19 °C to 32 °C in the summer. The area received mean annual precipitation of 2450 mm from both northeast and southwest monsoons.  2.2 Experimental setup A three-year field experiment was set up in 3-year-old oil palm plantations owned by smallholder farmers. A total of 12 square shape plots (each measuring 0.1 ha) was located at a similar elevation and soil condition was selected for the experiment. Nine plots were cultivated with maize, turmeric, and pineapple by selecting three plots for each intercrop. Only three food crops were tested in the present study because these are among the dominant crops of the region. Moreover, an experiment was set up to analyze the best performing agroforestry systems that can provide ecological as well as socioeconomic benefits to smallholders. Thus, one from each of the crop types i.e. food (maize), spices (turmeric), and fruit (pineapple) were tested in our field experiment that also helps provide economic benefits (comparatively high selling cost) and food security to all. Each plot had 10–12 oil palm trees planted in double rows under which intercrops maize (T1), turmeric (T2), and pineapple (T3) were sown/planted at 30 cm x 30 cm, 45 cm x 60 cm, 60 cm x 60 cm (between plants and row) uniform spacing, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1). Each oil palm plot (both mono and mixed cropping) was applied with N:P:K in 10:20:20 ratio during the juvenile phase of oil palm. A set of three replicate plots meant for a sole crop (T0) were also laid down every year as a control and received a similar NPK dose. Three adjacent available secondary forest/jhum  plots of the same age (3-year) and three natural forest (thereafter forest) plots (31.62 m x 31.62 m) were also selected to measure ecosystem attributes and compared with the oil palm monoculture and mixed agroforestry systems. The oil palm density (148 trees ha−1 ) remains the same in all the agroforestry systems. All the agroforestry plots were studied continuously for the 3rd, 4th, and 5th years.  2.3 Plant sampling and biomass estimation A stratified random sampling method was used to collect samples annually in monoculture oil palm (T0) and mixed cultivation lands (T1, T2, and T3). While secondary forests and forests were sampled once at the end of the experiment. Three random sampling locations were marked in each plot, and samples were collected during winter. Oil palm tree biomass was estimated through a semi-harvest method. The middlemost fronds of 10 trees grown in the area were harvested to estimate average frond biomass. For this purpose, each harvested individual frond was segregated into petiole, rachis, and leaflet, separately. A sub-sample of 100 g of each component was oven-dried at 80 °C for 48 h to determine the dry matter. The sum of all frond component dry mass and mean value of all 10 trees was taken to estimate the individual frond biomass of the tree. The trunk height (H1 ) and a total height of the tree (H2 ) and trunk diameter (D) were measured using a measuring tape. The biomass of different oil palm components (trunk biomass, frond biomass, old frond base biomass) was calculated to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB) using the following allometric equations as outlined in (Singh et al., 2018 ):(1) T r u n k  b i o m a s s  ( k g  t r e e − 1    )  = 0.25 × π × D 2  × H 1  × ρ     (2) F r o n d  b i o m a s s  ( k g  t r e e − 1    )  = N × D W     (3) O l d  f r o n d  b i o m a s s  ( k g  t r e e − 1    )  = N × D W     where D is the trunk diameter (m), H1  is the trunk height (m), ρ is oil palm density (kg m −3 ), N is a number of fronds, DW is the dry weight of a single frond (kg) calculated as 1.146 × (DWpetiole  + DWrachis  + DWleaflet ) (Corley and Tinker, 2008 ). The belowground biomass (BGB) was estimated by using root:shoot ratio (0.24) (Mokany et al., 2006 ). The intercrop biomass (maize, turmeric, and pineapple) was estimated from 100 g fresh weight of harvested plant parts (stem, leaf, grain, rhizome, roots), oven-dried at 80 °C for 24 h.  2.4 Soil sampling and analyses Soil samples were collected systematically from three random locations within a sample plot at two depths (0–15 and 15–30 cm) using a soil corer of known volume. Samples were collected from the palm basin leaving a 1 m distance from the palm trunk. Five subsamples were thoroughly mixed to make a composite sample for each depth. Undisturbed soil cores were collected separately for bulk density measurement. Samples were oven-dried at 105 °C for 48 h and estimated using the core method. One set of bulk soil samples for each depth from different plots were collected in air-tight bags with proper labeling and analyzed for soil physicochemical properties. The soil samples were air-dried, gently crushed, and passed through a 2-mm sieve before physicochemical analysis. Soil pH was determined in soil:water suspension (1:2.5, w/v) using a digital pH meter. Soil moisture content (SMC) was estimated gravimetrically by drying 10 g of field moist soil sample at 105 °C for 24 h. Water holding capacity (WHC) was determined using the Keen box method as described in (Anderson and Ingram, 1993 ). Soil organic matter (SOM) was determined using the loss on ignition method as a weight difference between 105 °C and 375 °C. Soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration was determined using the rapid dichromate oxidation method (Walkley and Black, 1934 ). Available phosphorus (Av  P) was determined calorimetrically (Bray and Kurtz, 1945 ) and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and plant-available nitrogen (Av  N) as described by (Subbiah and Asija, 1956 ). Available potassium (Av  K) was estimated by the 1 N ammonium acetate method (Jackson, 1973 ). The SOC stock (Mg C ha−1 ) was calculated by multiplying SOC concentration, bulk density (g cm−3 ) of fine earth fraction, and soil depth (cm). The sum of AGBC, BGBC, and SOC stock provides the estimate of total C stock density or ecosystem C stock. Considering relatively lower contribution of deadwood and litter to the total ecosystem C pool at the younger age of oil palm agroforestry, we presently omitted deadwood and litter C stock to estimate ecosystem C stock.  2.5 Estimation of crop yield Maize yield was estimated for 3 years using the test weight technique (Tandzi and Mutengwa, 2020 ) as:(4) Y i e l d  ( k g  h a − 1    )   =  [ ( N o .  o f  k e r n e l  r o w s  p e r  e a r      × N o .  o f  e a r s  p e r  m 2  / 100 )        × ( w e i g h t  o f  100  k e r n e l  ( g )  / 100  )  × 10 , 000 ]         The above values were multiplied by 1000 to convert in tonnes ha−1 . Turmeric fresh rhizome yield was estimated as per (Vanlalhluna et al., 2010 ). During the harvest of turmeric, the tubers were separated from the plants, cleaned and the fresh rhizome yield per plot was estimated, and converted to a per hectare basis.  2.6 Statistical analysis Differences in plant characteristics and soil properties under different agroforestry systems were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the differences between the mean values were tested using Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) post hoc test at P <0.05. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to check the influence of plantation age, different treatments, and their interaction on different plant growth parameters. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS Statistics 21.   3 Results 3.1 Soil physicochemical properties Soil physicochemical properties (0 – 15 cm and 15 – 30 cm) were analyzed at the start of field experiment that showed most of the soil properties varied significantly among the land use i.e. oil palm (3-year), secondary forest (3-year), and forest (Fig. 2  ). Soil pH was acidic and relatively higher under oil palm (5.78) but not significantly different from secondary forests and forests. Nevertheless, other soil properties like SMC (23.4%), WHC (39.1%), SOM (5.34%), and nutritional parameters (TKN; 0.64%, Av  N; 238 Kg ha−1 , Av  P; 12.7 Kg ha−1  and Av  K; 168.5 Kg ha−1 ) were significantly higher in forests. Soil properties in all the land use were found in the order of forest > oil palm plantation >secondary forest. Soil properties except WHC in the forest were higher in the top layer (0 – 15 cm) and decrease with soil depth. Soil properties at the experimental plots showed a significant variation in forests, secondary forests, and among the different agroforestry systems (Fig. 3  ). Soil particle size distribution indicates sandy clay loam texture in forests and sandy loam in secondary forests and different agroforestry sites. The distribution of sand, silt, and clay particles in fine soils showed significantly higher (P  <0.001) sand content in both the soil depth of secondary forests and lowest in T1 site. Silt content was highest in the top layer of the T2 site (31.7%) while forest had a higher clay content in the top layer (21.7%) but not significantly different from other study sites except T2 (11.6%; P  <0.002). We did not observe any specific trend in soil characteristics between the soil depths. Bulk density was significantly (P  <0.001) higher in the T1 site and lowest in T0 and increased with soil depth. SOC concentration was significantly (P  <0.001) higher in a forest (3.8%) and decreases with the soil depth in all the land uses. Similarly, SOC stock (0 – 30 cm) was significantly higher in forests (62.7 Mg C ha−1 ) and found lowest in the T2 site.  3.2 Plant growth, biomass, and crop yield Plant growth parameters (height and girth) and AGB of oil palm showed a steady increase along with the age of plantation from 3- to 5-year (Fig. 4  ). Plant height was higher at T3 in 3- and 4-year of planation while it was highest under the sole crop of oil palm (3.21 m) after 5-year of plantation. Likewise, plant girth was also higher in T3 after 3- and 4-year of planation and highest in 5-year-old sites (180 cm). In contrast, AGB was found similar in the sites among the treatments but highest in a sole crop of oil palm after 5-year (0.22 Mg tree−1 ). Results of both the individual and mixed effects of plant age and treatments on the growth parameters and AGB were tested using two-way ANOVA (Table 1  ). Plant height, girth, and AGB increased significantly (P  <0.001) along with the age of planation however, these parameters were not significantly different when grown under different treatments (T0, T1, T2, T3). Moreover, the interactive effect of age and treatments were also insignificant for height, girth, and AGB. Crop yield of the sole crop and intercrop varied among the different agroforestry systems and plantation age (Table 2  ). Crop yield of oil palm was decreased from 6.78 Mg ha−1  to 6.12 Mg ha−1  in T1 and 11.7 Mg ha−1  to 10.5 Mg ha−1  in T2 however, it showed a slight increase from 15.2 Mg ha−1  to 15.6 Mg ha−1  in T3 after 3- to 5-year. Unlike, intercrop yield was increased in all the agroforestry systems and was highest in the T3 system (10.8 Mg ha−1 ). Crop yield (both sole crop and intercrop) was highest in T3 and increased along with the plantation age.  3.3 Carbon accumulation in different plant parts and agroforestry systems The difference in biomass C stock was observed among the oil palm plant parts and varied significantly (P <0.001) along with the plantation age (Table 3  ). Among the plant parts, biomass C stock was significantly higher in trunk and lowest in rachis in all the agroforestry systems and ages of the plantation. Overall, C sequestration by the different plant parts was found in the order of trunk >petiole >frond base >leaflet >rachis in all the agroforestry systems. Biomass C was higher in the trunk of oil palm (T0) and petiole in the mixed cropping than oil palm sole  cropping. With an increase in plantation age, C stock was also increased in the sole crop and intercrops of different agroforestry systems (Fig. 5  ). Both oil palm and intercrop biomass C stock increased along with the plantation age and found highest in a 5-year-old site of T3 system (30.2 Mg C ha−1 ). However, the relative contribution of sole crop and intercrop C stock was substantially different among the agroforestry systems. For example, maize contributes only 5% to the biomass C stock in the 5-year-old site of T1 but pineapple contributes approximately 50% in the T3 site.  3.4 Ecosystem carbon stock Ecosystem C stock (AGBC + BGBC + SOC stock) was estimated to determine the overall C sequestration potential of the different agroforestry systems. Our estimates showed that ecosystem C stock increased along with the plantation age and found highest in the 5-year-old site in all the systems (Fig. 6  ). Ecosystem C stock in a 5-year-old site of different ecosystems was 45.35 Mg C ha−1 , 53.63 Mg C ha−1 , 42.98 Mg C ha−1 , and 55.44 Mg C ha−1  for T0, T1, T2, and T3, respectively. The percentage increase in ecosystem C stock after 3- to 5-years of the plantation was 28.6%, 24.0%, 24.2%, and 29.5% for T0, T1, T2, and T3, respectively. The results show that both the ecosystem C stock and the percentage increase in ecosystem C stock were highest in the T3 system. The relative contribution of different ecosystem components indicates higher C stock in soils (49% - 69%) compared to plant biomass among the agroforestry systems.   4 Discussion 4.1 Land use effect on soil properties Global demand for food and energy drives agricultural intensification that causes forest degradation and land use change (Rudel et al., 2009 ). Moreover, industrial activities and agriculture in tropical forests significantly reduce the soil quality and its C storage potential (Ahirwal et al., 2021 ). Therefore, climate-smart cultivation practices should be introduced to minimize the environmental consequences of intensive agriculture and plantation. Results of this study demonstrate that land use change from forest to secondary forests and oil palm plantation in northeast India had a significant impact on soil transformation. Results of the present study show that forests had a higher soil quality in terms of soil texture, nutrients, and organic matter. Moreover, the development of oil palm agroforestry enhanced the soil quality of the degraded jhum  lands. For instance, forest soil had the highest SOM concentration (5.34%) that reduced to 3.42% in secondary forests and 4.24% in oil palm plantations may be attributable to a decline in litter input and soil disturbance. The percentage of soil nutrients was also declined significantly in secondary forests (N-16%, P- 33%, K-31%) and oil palm plantation (N-10%, P- 21%, K-10%). Our results are consistent with the other studies which supported a decrease in soil quality after forest conversion to secondary forests and oil palm plantations (Behera et al., 2018 ). The introduction of intercrop under juvenile oil palm plantation improved the soil properties in terms of increasing silt and clay content while decreasing sand percentage. Though SOC concentration was significantly higher in forests, it was recorded higher under agroforestry systems compared to secondary forests. Among the agroforestry systems, T3 had a higher SOC concentration. Improved soil physical properties and SOC concentration in oil palm agroforestry may be due to the addition of organic matter through crop residue, empty fruit bunch, and physical mechanisms such as the mulch effect (Rahman et al., 2021 ). Forest soils had a significantly higher SOC stock (62.7 Mg C ha−1 ) among the studied land use. In agroforestry systems, T1 shows the highest SOC stock (36.7 Mg C ha−1 ) but the values are insignificantly different from T0, T2, and T3 systems. The differences in SOC stock are possibly due to the variation in root growth, SOC concentration, and soil texture. The study of young oil palm agroforestry systems reported higher SOC stock (87.6 – 91.8 Mg C ha−1 ) than the secondary forests (71.0 Mg C ha−1 ) in the eastern Amazon (de Carvalho et al., 2014 ). In contrast, SOC stock was higher in oil palm monoculture (45.5 Mg C ha−1 ) compared to oil palm agroforestry (39.1 Mg C ha−1 ) and tropical forests (36.3 Mg C ha−1 ) of Malaysia (Besar et al., 2020 ). These contrasting effects highlighted that SOC stock is highly dependent on intensive cropping systems and land management practices.  4.2 Oil palm growth and crop yield An increasing trend in oil palm growth was noticed in agroforestry systems than the oil palm monocropping, however, the 3-year trial was insufficient to conclude if the intercrops helped in enhanced oil palm growth. The important factors affecting oil palm growth are soil fertility, available water and climate, age, and cropping practice (Singh et al., 2018 ). Biomass accumulation of oil palm in monoculture and agroforestry systems is mainly governed by the trunk height as it contributes largely to total plant biomass. Although biomass C stocks increased along with the age of plantation, differences were insignificant among the agroforestry systems. This indicates that intercropping does not have a significant impact on the oil palm growth and biomass C stock. Whereas growth of different intercrops varied among the agroforestry systems and biomass C stock was highest in the T3 system. The growth of crop and intercrop in different agroforests highlighted the advantage of pineapple as an intercrop because it contributes about 50% to the total biomass C stock. Higher crop yield under monocropping than intercropping was mainly due to more land availability and lesser competition for soil nutrients in monocropping. Intercropping was also found to increase the forage quality in terms of dry matter yield and the fiber content of maize (Sahoo et al., 2015 ). Choice of approximate crop under oil palm would be most desirable as with increasing age of oil palm there will be shade effect and the intercrop will be of disadvantage if they are light sensitive. In monocropping, the competition for various resources is somewhat selective, and therefore on many occasions, their crop yield is better than mixed cropping (Sahoo et al., 2015 ). Oil palm is reported to consume a lot of nutrients that can be supplemented with organic mulch and recycled by-products of empty fruit bunch (Rahman et al., 2021 ). To make the system more sustainable, legume crops may be grown with oil palm, especially under sub-optimal conditions. This would reduce the C and N losses from oil palm and increase nutrient stock. Turmeric needs more NPK in the initial stage that can be supplied by the addition of organic mulch to improve the yield of fresh rhizome (Ravindran et al., 2007 ; Vanlalhluna et al., 2010 ). In the present study, turmeric is also a nutrient-depleting crop and a competitor for nutrient sharing, while pineapple and maize were better for maintaining oil palm growth. The introduction of annuals in the juvenile oil palm nevertheless provided quick investment recovery to the smallholders in terms of crop diversification and additional income. The monetary values of the crop depend on the existing market. According to the prevailing market price, the oil palm plantation after 4-years can fetch INR 65,270 to INR 166,820 ha−1  (US$ 870 – 2225; where 1 US$ ∼ 75 INR) and additionally, INR 56,000–400,000 ha−1  (US$ 746 - 5333) from the intercrop (calculated as oil palm fruit @10.7 rupees kg−1 , maize @20 rupees kg−1 , turmeric @30 rupees kg−1  and pineapple @40 rupees kg−1 ). This, however, does not include the input cost. According to an estimate of the Mizoram government, the oil palm crop after 4 years can generate a net income of INR 80,000–120,000 ha−1 . Similarly, fruit or turmeric production can generate a net income of INR 38,680 ha−1  yr−1  when intercropped in marginal farmlands (Vanlalhriatpuia et al., 2012 ). It is therefore paramount importance to support and promote diversification in oil palm especially at the juvenile phase to safeguard the economic and environmental prosperity of smallholders.  4.3 Ecosystem carbon stock in agroforestry systems Ecosystem C stock provides an overall estimate of the C sequestration potential of an ecosystem. However, ecosystem C stock of the oil palm agroforestry is seldom reported in the literature. As hypothesized, ecosystem C stock was notably higher in oil palm agroforestry systems where the T3 system (55.4 Mg C ha−1 ) had the highest stock compared to oil palm plantation (45.3 Mg C ha−1 ) thus sequestered grater atmospheric CO2  and contributes to mitigating climate change. The C stock in each ecosystem component (AGB, BGB, and SOC) increased along with the age of vegetation, and ecosystem C stock increased at a rate of 6.2 Mg C ha−1  yr−1  in the T3 system. Partition ecosystem C stock indicates that the majority of C stock was contributed by soils (up to 69%) than the plant biomass. However, an increase in plant biomass can contribute a significant amount of C stock along the development ages (Gogoi et al., 2021 ). Our study confirmed that oil palm growth in agroforestry systems had higher soil and plant biomass C stock thus converting monoculture oil palm to agroforestry systems can be a viable strategy to enhance ecosystem C stock. A growing number of studies have shown that oil palm is the most efficient oil crop having higher land productivity compared to other oil crops (Corley and Tinker, 2008 ; Khasanah et al., 2020 ; Tonye et al., 2005 ). In our study, 5-year-old T3 agroforestry systems sequester 203 Mg CO2  ha−1  which is approximately 22% greater than the monoculture oil palm plantation. Similarly, the growth of oil palm with agarwood in the agroforestry system reported 42% higher ecosystem C stock than in the monoculture oil palm (Besar et al., 2020 ). Since oil palm is a perennial crop it does not require annual land clearing and preparation that remarkably cut GHGs emissions. Nevertheless, the introduction of food crops along with oil palm is aiding the C sequestration potential and maintaining ecosystem health. Cultivation of oil palm in the agroforestry system improve smallholders’ economies and reduces reliance on fossil fuels. In addition, the adoption of perennial species, fruit trees, and other food crops in oil palm agroforestry substantially increases the biodiversity of the farms and provides multiple options to increase household income. In northeast India, jhum  cultivation is largely been practice that results in lower productivity and land degradation. Therefore, oil palm cultivation on jhum  land can be a viable option to halt land degradation and increase biodiversity.  4.4 Implications for achieving sustainable development goals Agroforestry is an increasingly recognized multifunctional sustainable environmental management approach that potentially achieves the UN-SDGs. Though the expansion of oil palm plantations in the tropics would affect biological diversity, it is important for global food security and bioenergy thus cannot be replaced by other crops (IUCN, 2018 ; Meijaard et al., 2018 ). Therefore, it is imperative to grow it sustainably without compromising for biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. The results of our study demonstrate that the inclusion of oil palm in an agroforestry system may be an alternative environmental management technique that can help to nullify the negative impacts of oil palm expansion. The growth of oil palm along with the maize, turmeric, and pineapple notably increases the crop and intercrop yield, ecosystem C stock, and combat biodiversity loss. Moreover, oil palm agroforestry partially helps to achieve the UN-SDGs by increasing farmers income and rural economy (No poverty #1), increasing crop yield and enhancing food quality (Zero hunger #2), producing nutritious food from crop and intercrop (Good health and well-being #3), support environmental-friendly cultivation of oil palm and generation of bioenergy (Affordable and clean energy #7), increase farmer and stakeholders income (Decent work and economic growth #8), biofuel production decrease reliance on fossil fuels (Responsible consumption and production #12), enhance ecosystem C pool, reduce carbon footprint, and mitigate climate change (Climate action #13), and promote sustainable use of degraded forests and potentially reversing land degradation (Life on land #15). Moreover, oil palm agroforestry initiatives fulfill the prime objectives of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration and REDD+ policy through restoring jhum  land and developing a healthy ecosystem that acts as a C sink. We recommend further studies on oil palm agroforestry with other food crops to enhance rural economies and attain global goals.   5 Conclusions Based on our field experiment and hypothesis, the development of oil palm in agroforestry systems provides more provisioning and regulatory services compared to monoculture oil palm plantations. Among the agroforestry systems, oil palm + pineapple agroforestry systems improve soil quality, produce greater crop yield and biomass, enhance ecosystem C stock, and are expected to provide considerable economic and environmental benefits. The performance of different agroforestry systems varied notably and increase along with the vegetation age. Oil palm agroforestry systems can support oil palm as a biofuel crop that reduces reliance on fossil fuel and food crops as intercrop ensure food security. Nevertheless, both crop and intercrop in juvenile oil palm agroforestry ensure bioenergy generation, carbon sequestration, improve smallholder economies, and an efficient way to achieve land degradation neutrality and the UN-SDGs in long term. Conversion of natural forests to establish oil palm is associated with numerous environmental consequences such as land use change and biodiversity loss. Therefore, our study recommends expansion of oil palm agroforestry on degraded forests and in particular jhum  lands of northeast India.
