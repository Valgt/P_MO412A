                  Developing an efficient, cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution for solid waste collection (SWC) and transportation system remains a major challenge for municipalities. Waste collection encompasses the largest part of the total budget in current waste management systems. SWC is a crosscutting issue that can be directly or indirectly linked to 10 of the 17 United Nations’ sustainable development goals (SDGs). This study aims to develop an SWC route optimisation model to improve collection efficiency, save collection costs and reduce emissions by considering fixed routing optimisation (FRO) with static data and variable routing optimisation (VRO) with real-time data. To realise the optimisation, a mixed-integer linear programming model utilising FRO and VRO was developed. Results show that VRO improved the collection efficiency by 26.08 % when the minimum filled-up level for collection was 70 %. Moreover, VRO achieved 44.44 % cost savings and 17.60 % carbon emission reduction at 70 % filled level. The proposed system achieved the targeted goals and demonstrated the feasibility of an optimisation model for the waste management sector to build a sustainable smart city. The findings of this study can be used to strengthen efforts towards the achievement of the SDGs related to solid waste collection and management.

Fig. 2   Table 1 SWC and management towards achieving SDGs.  Table 1     Domain Sustainable Development goal General Goal SWC and management towards achieving SDGs   1 Environment Protection     SDG 6: Clean water and sanitation 6.3: Enhance the water quality through pollution reduction, dumping elimination and minimisation of hazardous materials. - Ensure the environmentally sound disposal of all waste, particularly hazardous wastes like hazardous chemical and biological wastes.  - Eliminate open burning and uncontrolled dumping, as an initial stage to achieve an environmentally sound SW practices.  - Ensure an environmentally robust waste control system to protect the water and soil from biological and chemically toxic wastes.        SDG 12: Responsible consumption and production. 12.4: Establish an environmentally sound waste collection system, especially for chemical wastes, to decrease the detrimental environmental and human health consequences.  SDG 15: Life on land 15.1: Ensure the protection of the earth and freshwater, as well as the corresponding by-products.  SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy 7.2: Significantly increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. - Reduce the SW and non-SW produced from conventional power plants (e.g. SWs from fuels and coals during mining and fuel preparation).  - SWC technologies that can produce renewable energy from (organic) wastes.        SDG 13: Climate action 13: Take immediate measures to address the effects of climate change. - Using suitable SWC and management practices to prevent high GHG emissions.        SDG 14: Life below water 14.1: Prevent all kinds of marine pollution, including aquatic wastes from land-based activities. - Extending waste collection to marine life to stop prevent the wastes, especially plastics, from entering the oceans.        1 + 2  SDG 11: Sustainable cities 11.6: Decrease the negative environmental effects of cities by emphasising the importance of proper waste collection and management. - Eradicate open burning and uncontrolled dumping using optimised SWC services.        2-Public health Protection  SDG 3: Well-being and good health 3.2: Avoid the deaths of babies under 5 years of age. 3.3: Stop malaria and fight against waterborne diseases 3.9: Minimise the diseases caused by hazardous chemicals, contamination and pollution of water, air and soil. - Ensure the access to passable, harmless and efficient SWC services to prevent the risk of Hepatitis A (from pollution), B and C, as well as HIV/AIDS (from infectious medical waste), and malaria (from vector breeding).        SDG 11: Sustainable cities 11.1: Ensure everyone's access to the basic services and proper, secure and affordable housing in addition to the redevelopment of slums. - Overcome the challenges of rapid urbanisation and upgrade the slums through safe removal, efficient recycling and management of SW in cities so that the residences can thrive and expand whilst reducing the pollution and improving resource use.        3-Poverty reduction  SDG 8: Decent jobs and economic development 8: Promoting sustainable and inclusive economic development and providing decent work and jobs for everyone. - Support the individual, small and microenterprises’ SWC and SWM services to improve livelihoods.        3 + 4  SDG 1: No poverty 1.4: Ensure equal access to financial services and economic resources, including microfinance for all men and women, especially for the less fortunate and vulnerable people. - Providing waste management and reducing food loss.  - Proper SWC can be performed in urban and rural areas, as well as reuse and recycling, which present a significant potential for job creation.        4-Resource value  SDG 12: Accountable production and responsible consumption. 12.5: Minimise waste via the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle). 12.3: Halve the global food waste in the supply chain and further reduce food losses. This goal contributes to goal 2 as well (i.e., zero hunger, enhanced health, food security and sustainable agriculture) - Create ‘green’ jobs and lessen waste generation through prevention and the 3Rs.  - Decrease the food losses in the supply chain.  - Waste reduction should be the highest level choice in the hierarchy of waste management, followed by the reuse of goods and recycling of materials.

Developing an efficient, cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution for solid waste collection (SWC) and transportation system remains a major challenge for municipalities. Waste collection encompasses the largest part of the total budget in current waste management systems. SWC is a crosscutting issue that can be directly or indirectly linked to 10 of the 17 United Nations’ sustainable development goals (SDGs). This study aims to develop an SWC route optimisation model to improve collection efficiency, save collection costs and reduce emissions by considering fixed routing optimisation (FRO) with static data and variable routing optimisation (VRO) with real-time data. To realise the optimisation, a mixed-integer linear programming model utilising FRO and VRO was developed. Results show that VRO improved the collection efficiency by 26.08 % when the minimum filled-up level for collection was 70 %. Moreover, VRO achieved 44.44 % cost savings and 17.60 % carbon emission reduction at 70 % filled level. The proposed system achieved the targeted goals and demonstrated the feasibility of an optimisation model for the waste management sector to build a sustainable smart city. The findings of this study can be used to strengthen efforts towards the achievement of the SDGs related to solid waste collection and management.   Keywords Waste collection  Optimisation model  Collection efficiency  Cost saving  Emission reduction  Sustainable development goals    1 Introduction The growth of population and urbanization, combined with growing environmental concerns, has created a critical situation such that the management or policy-makers must look for different sustainable means of effectively collecting and disposing the solid waste. It has also made solid waste collection (SWC) more delicate in terms of traffic congestion and fuel consumption and its subsequent cost, environmental pollution (greenhouse gas emission), etc. Moreover, a huge amount of the budget is spent on this sector. The concern regarding its efficiency has increased even more with the emerging modern era. In consequence of this concern, many municipalities (especially in industrialized nations) are forced to assess the cost-effectiveness and environmental impacts of their solid waste management (SWM) systems, particularly waste collection route optimization (Akhtar, Hannan, Begum, Basri, & Scavino, 2017 ). Proper management of solid waste lessens or fully abolishes various adverse impacts on the environment and human health, and supports economic development along with quality of life improvement. In this context, the SWC is a key factor towards improving the SWM, reducing the cost, and minimizing the environmental impacts. However, municipalities struggle to determine the best performance enhancement plan for achieving the optimum efficiency of SWC. Therefore, an efficient SWC has both positive effects on economic and environmental perspective that can be achieved by proper route planning. An automated and intelligent solid waste (SW) monitoring system can reduce the costs and emissions associated with SWC. Research on the life cycle assessment has also been conducted to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, fuel consumption, transport, collection efficiency and toxicity. Despite the prominent economic growth, the SWM is relatively poor, unplanned and indiscriminate in different countries across the world such as Malaysia (Hassan et al., 2000 ). In this regard, about 40 %–80 % of local authority’s total expenditure are consumed by SWM and public cleansing (Anwar, Syukri, Rahman, & Bakar, 2013 ). Another study shows that about 50 % of the local government’s budget is consumed by SWM and from this, more than 50 % of the amount is spent on collection activities (Abd Manaf, Samah, & Zukki, 2009 ). Despite the huge allocation, local authorities still face many problems related to waste collection and transportation and can only collect approximately 76 % of the total waste generated (Bing et al., 2016 ). The challenge of sustainable waste management is a global issue; if it is not properly dealt with, it poses a threat to many parts of public health, society, economy, and environment. It has strong linkages to a range of other global challenges such as health, climate change, poverty reduction, food and resource security and sustainable production and consumption. Waste management is well embedded within the sustainable development goals (SDGs), being included either explicitly or implicitly in 10 out of the 17 United Nations’ SDGs (UN, S.D.G., 2019 ). In this regard, SWC is closely linked to the SDG's various development goals, including healthy life, clean water and sanitary conditions, poverty reduction, sustainable urban life, food and resource security, affordable and clean energy, decent work, reasonable consumption and production, improved land life and climate change. Thus a strong argument and efficient collection method in order to reduce cost and emission can be made for the strategic importance of improving waste management, insofar as actions here will contribute to progress towards a range of SDG targets. Setting and monitoring global targets for waste management will thus contribute significantly toward attaining the SDGs (Phillips & Mondal, 2014 ; Premakumara et al., 2018 ; UN). In general, efficiency implies accomplishing goals effectively and obtaining maximum results with minimum effort. Improvement of collection efficiency through an effective methodology is a basic aspect of SWC (Lella, Mandla, & Zhu, 2017 ). Route planning is a technological solution to identify the shortest routes through optimisation (Kuo & Wang, 2011 ). With the advancements in sensing and communication technologies, the prospect of smart bin has increased the viability and accessibility of real-time trash bin monitoring towards efficient SWC (Al Mamun, Hannan, Hussain, & Basri, 2016 ). Real-time monitoring of the waste fill level and weight in bins provides updated information that enables proper optimisation of the collection route, thus improving collection efficiency using the exact data instead of historical ones. At present, based on various studies such as (Alam & Qiao, 2019 ; Beliën, De Boeck, & Van Ackere, 2014 ; Hannan, Arebey, Begum, & Basri, 2011 ) it is confirmed that most of the municipalities across the globe perform SWC task without considering the demand and routes construction is based on static or historical data or completely left it as the responsibilities of the driver. Thus, there is an increasing need to develop an intelligent system for real time monitoring of bin status for proper route optimization to improve the waste collection efficiency. It is well known that the amount of waste is highly variable among the bins of different customers. Therefore, predicting which bins and how many of them a collection vehicle should collect before the bins overflow or the collection vehicle reaches its capacity limit is difficult. Collecting partially filled bins is unnecessary, increases collection costs and pollutant emissions and decreases collection efficiency (McLeod et al., 2013 ). A study has been conducted on the development of solid waste integrated management with factors and management systems to evaluate the economic and environmental impacts of various waste management options (Wang, 2001 ). Route optimisation is a common problem in SWC operations that exerts various effects on collection efficiency, collection costs and pollutant emissions. The route optimisation problem is also known as the vehicle routing problem (VRP), which has been extensively studied to reduce the total driving cost of the vehicles from a depot to the customers, and then back to the depot via an optimised route (Hannan, Al Mamun, Hussain, Basri, & Begum, 2015 ). The total travel distance should also be minimised to further reduce the corresponding environmental effects. VRP determines an optimal route design for vehicle fleets to satisfy a geographically diverse customer base. Stochastic VRP is a type of VRP with one or more stochastic components with random state (Han & Ponce Cueto, 2015 ; Ramdhani, Baihaqi, & Siswanto, 2018 ). However, for SWC, stochastic components lack the information on multiple factors, including the numbers of user for a bin, demographic context and social behaviour towards waste generation, seasonality and many other factors. Capacitated VRP (CVRP) is mainly constrained by the capacity of vehicles, in which the volume and weight capacity can be handled by each vehicle per trip (McLeod & Cherrett, 2008 ). Each vehicle performs the actual collection by compressing the waste, so the capacity of a vehicle is measured in terms of weight instead of volume. When the full capacity of the vehicle is reached, the driver should empty the waste from the truck at a disposal facility. However, in most cases, each vehicle is assumed to depart from the depot, collect bins from only one route that has multiple stops, and then return to the depot. VRP with time windows (VRPTW) is another kind of VRP problem, in which some or all of the customers have specific time windows during which the waste should be collected. The time window commonly considers commercial waste collection, but rarely residential waste collection, and typically refers to where and when the vehicle is supposed to be unloaded during the shift. However, the main purpose of this constraint is that the vehicles must respect a specific time frame with an imposed start and finish times during the workday (Nesmachnow, Rossit, & Toutouh, 2018 ). The common optimisation methods include waste collection route optimisation through route length reduction (Islam & Rahman, 2012 ), time (Ağaçsapan & Çabuk, 2020 ), waste content (Louati, 2016 ) and cost optimisations (Malakahmad, Bakri, Mokhtar, & Khalil, 2014 ). To optimise these parameters in a realistic environment, a few constraints have been considered. With the development of artificial intelligence, researchers have been trying to create intelligent waste collection systems. Intelligent technologies have been utilised in various fields (e.g. radio frequency identification, VANET, image processing and intelligent bins using different sensors) (Arebey, Hannan, Begum, & Basri, 2012 ; Budzianowski, 2012 ; Hannan et al., 2011 ) that have been integrated with optimisation models to maximise the collection efficiency. Optimal strategies are thus the key concern in all aspects of engineering towards an effective SWC. There is a number of software packages used in waste collection and route optimization such as radio frequency identification (RFID), global positioning system (GPS), general packet radio system (GPRS), and geographic information system (GIS) with a camera are constructed for SWC. The identification technology based systems can track the location and collection time of bins and vehicles to facilitate automated collection, but this system cannot estimate the status and waste level in bins (Mishra, Ghosh, & Jena, 2019 ; Vasagade, Tamboli, & Shinde, 2020 ; Zhao, Wang, Zang, & Wan, 2019 ). In addition, heuristic approaches have become popular to overcome the complexity of conventional approaches. In the case of optimization problems, conventional approaches require considerable computational time. These problems are minimized using heuristic approaches. For instance, (Qiao, Tao, Wu, Yu, & Zhang, 2020 ) applied particle swarm optimization (PSO) for waste collection optimization. (Mi, Dordevic, & Arsić, 2017 ) used nearest neighbourhood search algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA) for waste vehicle routing optimization. Artificial neural network (ANN) (Vu, Bolingbroke, Ng, & Fallah, 2019 ), and backtracking search algorithm (BSA) (Akhtar et al., 2017 ) also have been used for collection optimization. However, these techniques lack precision and require a long execution time in collecting solid waste (Hannan et al., 2018 ). Thus, a new technique is required for efficient collection optimization. Moreover, most of the above mentioned studies have not sufficiently dealt with the issues on cost and emission. In addition, some of the important factors were not taken into consideration such as bin capacity or waste level, the weight of waste inside bin, vehicle maintenance, frequency of collection, vehicle capacity, and trip rate using real-time waste status data. Furthermore, the link between SWC efficiency, cost and CO2  reduction, and SDGs is not sufficiently covered. This study discusses on route optimisation techniques that involve solid waste bin monitoring system. Such techniques can aid in solving the routing problem by allowing the municipality to gather real-time data about the waste fill level in different bins. The control centre software created routes for each vehicle based on the fill rate, which increased the collection efficiency. The system developed by other studies (Al Mamun et al., 2016 ; Hannan et al., 2011 ), along with the proposed optimisation model, can improve the efficiency of SWC, save money and reduce emissions to foster a sustainable environment. Fixed (FRO) and variable routing optimisations (VRO) are utilised through mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). In this context and in order to enhance the SWC efficiency depending on many factors such as the number and level of bins, the weight of waste inside bin, vehicle maintenance, frequency of collection, vehicle capacity, and trip rate, as well as to contribute towards achieving the SDGs related to SWC, the main objective of this study is to develop an intelligent system for real time monitoring of bin status that raises the opportunity to improve the waste collection efficiency by route optimization using the collected data. This method will increase the ability of smart bin to gather the details on its status as soon as any change is made. Moreover, the developed SWC route optimisation model is aimed to improve collection efficiency, reduce fuel consumption, save collection costs and reduce CO2  emissions. This research paper is divided into five sections. Section 2  introduces the solid waste collection towards achieving the SDG. A wide-range description of the proposed solid waste collection optimized models including the problem description, mathematical model formulation, model for fuel consumption, cost saving and emission reduction are presented in Section 3 . Further, Section 4  introduces the results and discussion. Finally, the conclusion is presented in Section 5 .  2 Solid waste collection in achieving sustainable development goals The 2030 SDGs, adopted in 2015 by all member states of the UN, offer a common vision for prosperity and peace for the planet and the people (UN). These SDGs are based on time-limited targets, called the five Ps, which include prosperity, planet, people, partnership and peace (Fuldauer, Ives, Adshead, Thacker, & Hall, 2019 ). Efficient SWC and management are crucial items that more than 2 billion persons are lacking (Rodić & Wilson, 2017 ), with a cross-cutting problem that can be directly or indirectly linked to 10 out of 17 SDGs. SW is a common threat that affects several domains of sustainable development in three areas of sustainability, namely, economy, society and ecology. The affected domains include public health, living conditions, sanitation, access to decent jobs, terrestrial and marine ecosystems and sustainable natural resource utilisation. Table 1   presents the 10 SDGs with their related goals and links to solid waste collection and management, which are what the present study aims to optimise. Moreover, the route optimisation model approach has a wide range of benefits related to each of the SDG integrated dimensions (i.e. social, economic and environmental) of the sustainable development, as illustrated in Fig. 1  . The implementation of SWC in the small or large municipalities can help achieving multiple SDGs and the corresponding targets related to improving the sustainable smart city/village via environment protection, public health protection, and poverty reduction. These targets can be achieved by efficiently directing SWM towards responsible consumption and production, rising the renewable energy share in the global energy mix, preventing marine pollution, greatly reducing GHG emissions, reducing chemical and biological hazardous wastes, ensuring the supply of clean water and sanitation, maintaining well-being and good health, developing sustainable cities, providing decent work and promoting economic growth and poverty reduction (Table 1 ).  3 Solid waste collection optimized models A route optimisation model consists of the optimisation problems and model assumptions, including fuel, cost and emissions. Optimising waste collection routes involves several decisions, such as on which streets should each garbage truck travel, which containers should be collected by which truck and how many trucks are necessary for a fleet in a given city. Until now, the solution to this problem does not consider real-time information about the fill status of a bin. The route optimisation models for FRO and VRO are discussed in the following subsections. 3.1 Problem description SWM is the collection, transportation, processing, recycling or disposal, and monitoring of waste materials. The first action carried out in SWM is waste collection and transportation. In this context, waste collection vehicles begin their tour from a depot and then collect wastes from the waste containers in municipal facilities, such as residential and business areas. After the waste has been collected, all vehicles go back to the depot. After the waste is extracted in a warehouse, it is moved by different transport vehicles to the destinations such as a recycling plant, a landfill, an incineration plant or a composting facility. This study considered only the routing of the collection vehicles. A collection vehicle moves from bin to bin and unloads such bins within a route. The cumulative waste from the bins must not exceed the vehicle capacity. For FRO, the operators do not have any advanced information, such as the fill level and weight of waste bin. Consequently, all bins are considered for collection during route planning, regardless of the bin status. FRO is inefficient in terms of waste collection per unit distance because emptying partially filled bins is an unnecessary waste of resources (Akhtar et al., 2017 ). However, if the bin status is known in advance, the authority can plan and optimise the collection routes by considering only the full bins or the bins that are filled up to a certain level. Thus, for VRO, the collection route can change according to the bin status. Routes must be provided daily on the basis of recent bin status information. Although the real-time calculation of the routes is not required, a solution must be provided within one to two hours. This constraint requires an efficient solution to be determined within the specified time frame for the graphs of large cities, which comprise several thousand vertices. Therefore, the problem can be tackled by either consider collecting the waste from all bins (FRO) or from certain bins (VRO) by minimising the total distance travelled by the vehicles and considering their total capacity.  3.2 Mathematical model formulation and main assumptions Suppose that a set of bins must be unloaded, and the distances between each pair of bins and between the depot and each bin are known. For FRO, the bin fill level and weight are unknown, and the routes are planned by assuming that all bins are full and carry the maximum weight. By contrast, the bin status information is known in advance in VRO, and the routes are planned by considering only the bins that exceed the minimum fill level. To accomplish the mathematical formulation, a complete graph with the bins (i.e. nodes) and the depot must be considered. A feasible solution is represented by a group of routes consisting of depots, in which all bins belong to only one depot. In the optimisation model, the following assumptions have been made to formulate a mathematical model for VRO waste collection.• The waste collection vehicle fleet is homogeneous (i.e. all vehicles have the same operational costs and capacities).  • k  ≥ 1, where k  is the number of vehicles. If k  = 1, the problem can be modeled as a travelling salesman problem.  • The weight of the waste inside a particular bin is proportional to the waste fill level of that bin.  • Split collection is not allowed (i.e. every bin must be collected and visited by only one vehicle). In addition, the collection cost is proportional to the distance traveled and the weight collected.  • Only one depot exists, and every vehicle starts and returns to that depot.  • The travel times are fixed.    The mathematical model formulation was developed using the model parameters, and the variables and related indices can be expressed as follows.• (i j ) are the indices (i.e. [from, to]) of a pair of locations (i, j  = 0,1,2,….n , where n  is the total number of locations, 0 indicates the depot, and 1, 2 …… n  indicates the bins).  • k  is the set of waste collection vehicles (k  = 1, 2…m , where m  is the total number of available waste collection vehicles).  • V  is the capacity of waste collection vehicle in terms of load.  • F i    denotes filled-up waste level parameter of bin i .  • W i    mention to the weight of waste inside bin i .  • C i j     is the distance between each pair of bins and between collection point and bins.  • M   is the minimum waste filled up level of a bin that must have to be considered for collection in case of route planning with real time bin status data.  • b i k     is a binary variable that specifies whether bin i  belongs to the route of vehicle k  or not  • x i j k     is a binary variable that states if vehicle k  goes from bin i  to bin j .    The mathematical model can then be formulated as follows.(1) Minimise ∑ i = 0  n  ∑ j = 0  n  ∑ k = 1  m  C i j   x i j k           Subject to:(2) ∑ k = 1  m  b i k    =   1   i   =   1 ,   2   ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ n         (3) ∑ k = 1  m  ∑ j = 1  n  x i j k    =   1    i   =   1 ,   2   ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ n         (4) ∑ i = 1  n  ∑ j = 0  n  W i  x i j k    ≤   V    k =   1 ,   2   ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ m         (5) ∑ j = 1  n  ∑ k = 1  m  x 0 j k    =   1      (6) ∑ i = 1  n  ∑ k = 1  m  x i 0 k    =   1      (7) ∑ j = 1  n  x i j k    =   ∑ j = 1  n  x j i k    =   b i k     i   =   0 ,   1 ,   2   ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ n   k   =   1   ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ m         (8) ∑ i ,   j ∈   S   x i j k    ≤   S    −   1   S ⊆   { 1 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ n }   S  ≥   2   k =   1 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ m         (9) x i j k   ∈   { 0 ,   1 }   i ,   j =   0 ,   1 , ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ n   ;   i ≠   j         for FRO      (10) x i j k   ∈   { 0 ,   1 }   i ,   j =   0 ,   1 , ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ n   |   f i  ≥   F   ;   i ≠   j   for VRO           The objectives of the above mathematical formulation are as follows: Eq. (1)  minimises the total distance travelled by the waste collection vehicles. Eqs. (2)  and (3)  respectively guarantee that each bin belongs to only one route and only one collection vehicle visits each bin. Eq. (4)  ensures that the sum of the collected waste will not exceed the vehicle capacity. Eqs. (5)  and (6)  state that the collection vehicles must leave and enter the depot only once, respectively. Eqs. (7)  and (8)  are the feasibility constraints for route selection, wherein the former determines the incoming and outgoing arc for each bin and the latter determines the subtour removal. Eq. (9)  ensures that all bins are considered in the route calculation for the FRO. Eq. (10)  guarantees that the fill level of the considered bins is at least equal to a threshold value for the VRO.  3.3 Model for fuel consumption, cost saving and emission reduction A waste collection vehicle passes through several phases when collecting waste. The vehicle drives from the depot to the collection area, collects the waste, drives to a treatment facility and then unloads the waste. After the final step, the vehicle can continue in the same collection area, drive to a new one or return to the depot. The fuel consumption during the collection phase can be calculated as (Larsen, Vrgoc, Christensen, & Lieberknecht, 2009 )(11) F collection  = F total  − F t,empty  + F t,full     M      where F c o l l e c t i o n     is the total diesel consumption for one tonne of waste collected (L), F t o t a l     is the total diesel consumption, F t , e m p t y     is the diesel consumption when the vehicle drives empty from the depot to the collection area and from the treatment facility to the next collection area or to the depot, F t , f u l l     is the diesel consumption when the vehicle is driving full from the collection area to the treatment facility and M  represents the total tonnes of the collected wastes. For easy calculation, the measurement units for the simulation data were assumed to be one kilometer for 10 units of distance and one kilogram for 1 unit of weight. In this study, a multi-modal (compaction) waste collection vehicle with a diesel engine was assumed to consume an average of 0.67 L of diesel per km distance travelled (Plötz, Schneider, Globisch, & Dütschke, 2014 ). According to Eq. (11) , Ftotal   = total distance travelled during the route (km) × 0.67 L/km, Ft,empty   = distance from the depot to the first bin in the route (km) × 0.67 L/km and Ft,full   = distance from the final bin to the depot (km) × 0.67 L/km. The carbon emissions in the collection/transportation stage mainly originate from the vehicles during the transportation of the municipal solid waste (MSW). The carbon emissions (E C O 2      ) can be calculated using Eq. (12)  (Song, Liu, Jiang, & Liu, 2011 ).(12) E C O 2    = M S W × D × F × N C V f u e l   × E F f u e l    ρ      where MSW  is the total amount of the transported MSW, D  is the distance from a collection point to treatment facilities (km), F  is the fuel consumption rate (L/km), N C V  f u e l     is the net heat value of the fuel (MJ/L), E F  f u e l     is the CO2  emission factor of the fuel (kgCO2 /L) and ρ  is the density of the fuel (kg/L). It is well-known that most of the waste collection vehicles have diesel engines. Therefore, the CO2  emissions of the vehicle with a diesel engine are calculated according to Eq. (12) . The diesel fuel has net heat value (NCVfuel  )=39 MJ/L, CO2  emission factor (EFfuel  ) = 2.67 kgCO2 /L, and density (ρ )=0.832 kg/L (Okashii, 2015 ; Speight, 2011 ). Although the collection and transportation costs depend on many factors, the distance travelled and fuel consumption are the two principal parameters that control the system operation cost. The waste collection and transportation costs can be calculated using Eq. (13)  (Zsigraiova, Semiao, & Beijoco, 2013 ).(13) Collection Cost = ∑ j  ∑ i  L C j      t i j   + C F f c i d l e , i j   t i d l e , i j   + M C j  + C F f c i j     d i j          where L C  j    is the labor cost of vehicle j , t i j     is the total time spent by vehicle j  on the route i , CF  is the fuel cost, f c  i d l e , i j     is the idle mode fuel consumption of vehicle j  on route i , t i d l e , i j     is the total idle time spent by vehicle j  in route i , M C  j    is the maintenance cost of vehicle j , f c  i j     is the traveling mode fuel consumption of vehicle j  on route i  and d i j     is the total distance traveled by vehicle j  on route i . In this study, the collection cost was calculated in terms f c  i j     and d i j     ; all other terms are considered constants.   4 Results and discussion To calculate the collection cost and emissions, some constant data and data from previous investigations were used. The obtained results on the improvement of the collection efficiency and the reduction of the collection cost and emissions are discussed in the following subsections. 4.1 Waste generation data The values related to the bin status parameters were generated using a uniform distribution. The uniform distribution is chosen in this study to solve distribution problem in mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), because uniform distribution estimates accurate distance between the bins for the managers on the distribution characteristics during collection. Also in this case study, uniform distribution meets the distribution requirements to the solver to minimize the distance of the route between the bins to achieve the objective functions. The depot and bin positions on a Euclidean plane have been randomly created. The x and y coordinates values of the locations were set as (1, 100), and the depot was positioned at the center (50, 50). The Euclidean distance equation was used to calculate the distance between each pair of bins as well as between each bin and the depot. Based on the uniform distribution as (0, 100), the bin level values were generated. Although the weight of SW depends on the material, the test weight was measured as a proportion of the fill level to simplify the computation. For the corresponding bins, the weight values are considered to be half of the bins fill level values. Because the model was based on integer linear programming, the ceiling function was used for both the bin fill rate and weight values. In the model testing, the measurement for the bin fill level was percent (%), and all generated values were considered units. The capacity of a waste collection vehicle was assumed 200 units. For simulation, 20 bins and one depot were considered. The Euclidean distances between all pairs of locations for all bins and a bin’s fill and weight values are presented in Table 2  (a) and (b), respectively.  4.2 Route optimisation results The FRO and VRO were utilised to optimise the solid waste route using the generated simulation data. Although the bin’s waste fill level and weight were simultaneously updated, both were not available when the route was planned for the FRO. Thus for the FRO, the system calculated the routes assuming that all bins were full, the weights were at the maximum and the routes were fixed at all times. For the VRO, the updated bin status was available and the generated optimised route varied with time. To calculate the routes for the VRO, three value ranges (90 %, 80 % and 70 %) were assumed for the bin fill level threshold (i.e. the minimum fill levels considered for collection). It is worth noting that the VRO can operate for a combination of filled levels. However, in order to reduce the transportation cost, emissions from transportation, and the number of worker, the collection has been done for the bin that is filled with levels at 70 % and above. The FRO and VRO of the solid waste collection is shown in Fig. 2  . For the FRO with 20 bins and one depot, the proposed route optimisation model generated four routes (Fig. 2 (a)). Four collection vehicles are required to travel a total distance of 804 units and collect 561 units of SW. In the case of VRO, when a 90 % bin fill level threshold is assumed, two optimised routes were generated (Fig. 2 (b)), implying that two vehicles should travel a total distance of 337 units and collect 232 units of SW. Assuming an 80 % bin filled level threshold for the latter, Fig. 2 (c) represents the two optimised routes that were generated for the VRO, which indicates that two vehicles should travel a total distance of 497 units to collect 357 units of waste. When the bin fill level threshold was set as 70 %, three optimised routes were generated for the VRO (Fig. 2 (d)), which means that a total distance of 576 units should be covered by three vehicles to collect 503 units of waste. It is worth mentioning that in one route waste collection, the comparison between the scenarios would not provide the same service to both the citizen and the municipality. However, the uncollected bins will certainly be filled up and collected in the next generated route. Thus, waste collection for one month or yearly units by different scenarios would also validate the comparison.  4.3 Collection efficiency improvement and fuel consumption reduction In this study, the collection efficiency was measured in terms of the weight collected by the collection vehicles per unit distance. To achieve an efficient collection operation, the weight of the wastes collected for every kilometer of the required distance should be maximised. Table 3   compares the route optimisation for all bins and the depot and shows the fuel consumption, collected weight and the fuel consumption per unit of waste collection for both models. The results show that for every fill level, the total fuel consumption for the VRO model is less than that for the FRO model.  4.4 Cost saving and emission reduction Although various factors are necessary to calculate the exact cost for waste collection, this study considered the fuel consumption cost to be the collection cost due to its dependency on the distance travelled. The distance travelled, in turn, directly impact the maintenance cost for the waste collection vehicles. One of the major benefits of a real-time monitoring system is that the data for the waste bin fill-level and weight allows the control center software to precisely plan the routes in advance. Moreover, waste collection vehicles travelled a few of kilometres less which lead to the reduction of its fuel consumption and maintenance costs. Furthermore, as only the bins at replenishment level will be collected, the number of unloading stops will decrease and thus a significant reduction of the collection cost will be achieved. The developed system reduced the number of collection vehicles, and consequently eliminated the collection cost associated with the number of collecting personnel. When calculating the collection cost, certain assumptions are necessary. In this study, the waste collection cost was calculated using simulated data along with some constants and several data from previous investigations because the actual data were unavailable. As a result, the calculated collection costs are not exact, but rather just an estimate used to compare the collection costs for FRO and VRO. Table 4   shows the percentage of the reduction in the collection cost for both models. During waste collection, the collection vehicles usually emit a large amount of pollutants because they travel empty for miles, which results in high fuel consumption. A major advantage of the proposed system is the positive environmental impact due to decreased number of stops, the minimum distance travelled and fewer collection vehicles used, all of which result in less emissions. In general, shorter travelled distance means less emission. Several pollutants are emitted due to the fuel combustion by the collection vehicles. The calculation can be emission-specific, and CO2  is the most used pollutant. In this study, the CO2  emissions were calculated based on fuel consumption, which depends on the distance travelled. Table 5   presents the percentage emission reduction of CO2  for VRO and FRO.  4.5 Discussion The proposed system’s potential for collection optimisation is obtained by simulating the proposed route optimisation model. The MILP model is developed to optimize both the FRO and VRO. The results show that by applying the proposed system, along with the optimisation model, the SWM performances can be improved. The weight collected per unit distance for FRO and VRO with a 90 % fill level threshold was 0.69 units (Table 3 ). However, fewer vehicles are required for the latter than for the former. For the VRO, a fill level threshold of 70 % requires 0.87 units of weight collected, which is higher and offers a better solution compared to that of a fill level threshold of 80 % with only 0.72 units. Table 3  shows the comparison of the percentages of the improvement of the collection efficiency for VRO and FRO in terms of the weight collected per unit distance. The results in Table 3  indicates that using 90 % as the fill level threshold for VRO yields the same collection efficiency as that for FRO. However, when the threshold value is 80 %, the efficiency increases to 4.35 %. At a 70 % threshold, the waste collection efficiency reaches 26.08 %. On the basis of the values in Table 4 , adopting the proposed system reduces the collection costs because of the lower distance travelled by the collection vehicles. In this case, the VRO with a 70 % fill level threshold presented the best possible vehicle route among the three levels based on real-time information, with approximately 44 % cost reduction compared to the FRO. This results is better than the results obtained by Johansson (2006) (10 %–20 %). BSA used in (Akhtar et al., 2017 ) for SWC proved that the optimal threshold waste level is between and 70 % and 75 %, while the CO2  emission is reduced to 44.68 % which is comparable with this study. However, the number of bins and time used for collections were higher than those used in this study. As Table 5  indicates that by applying the developed system, the environmental effects will be diminished because of the smaller distance covered and less time spent on the road than the current condition, which eventually leads to reduced emissions. In summary, the VRO with a fill level threshold of 70 % provides the best possible vehicle routes based on real-time information, yielding a 17.60 % CO2  emission reduction. It is important to note that, the route optimization application is implemented to show the comparisons between FRO with static data and VRO with real time data for highlighting the achievement of the SDGs. Thus, in the case of VRO, the collection route can be changed with the bin’s status and provided route information. However, some of the bins are still uncollected. This constraint can be solved in the next collection route. Thus, this solution could be efﬁcient within the time frame for routes of large cities, which are composed of several thousand vertices. So, the problem in collecting the waste of all bins (in case of FRO) or certain bins (in case of VRO) could be solved by minimizing the total distance travelled by the vehicles and considering their total capacity. The developed optimization model opens the potential and validates the feasibility of the developed bin monitoring system to be used practically in the waste management sector. The route optimisation model approach has a wide range of benefits related to each of the SDG integrated dimensions (i.e. social, economic and environmental) of the sustainable development. Three main objectives have been achieved in this study, including the improvement in collection efficiency, CO2  emission reduction, and cost saving. These three objectives achieved and the output of this study are linked to the related SDGs targets as follows:(a) Improvement in collection efficiency: Since the results of the proposed method increased the collection efficiency by 26.08 %, it contributes to directly in achieving SDG3 (well-being and good health), SDG11 (sustainable cities), and SDG15 (life on land), as the collection efficiency can reduce the transmission of disease from infectious medical waste, reduce pollution, as well as enhance the healthy life, air, and land, respectively. On the other hand, increasing the collection efficiency in general would indirectly contribute to achieving SDG14 (life below water), SDG7 (Affordable and clean energy), and SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation).  (b) The proposed method reduced CO2  emission which is linked to SDG13 (climate action), SDG 11(sustainable cities), and SDG3 (Well-being and good health). As it well known that the SW is one of the key reason of GHG emission, by implementing the proposed method, the immediate measures have been taken to address the effects of climate change as it reduced the emission by 17.60 %. Meanwhile, the CO2  reduction can be linked indirectly with SDG14 (Life below water) and SDG6 (clean water and sanitation).  (c) As the proposed strategy reduced the cost into 44.44 %, it directly contributes in achieving SDG8 (decent jobs and economic development) because the cost saving will facilitate the municipal in economic growth, while indirectly linked to SDG1 (no poverty) and SDG12 (accountable production and responsible consumption).    The expected benefits of the proposed SWC to reduce the cost and CO2  emission towards achieving SDG11 (sustainable cities) can be summarized as the reduction in GHG emissions related to the waste management sector, enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanization and capacity for participatory, enhance the healthy life, air, and land inside the cities. Furthermore, cost saving enables the economic growth of cities, which leads to the development of other sectors. In addition, it enhances waste infrastructure development, technology evaluation, and ensures the deployment of cost-effective and efficient waste collection and transportation services. Overall, the obtained results show that the proposed optimization technique has the ability to achieve the SWC efficiently along with cost saving, CO2  emission reduction, collection efficiency enhancement, and fuel consumption minimization which contribute towards achieving the 10 SDGs, as illustrated in Section 2 . Thus, this study can increase the effort towards achieving SDG-2030 by optimizing the SWC to contribute in environmental protection, poverty reduction, public health production, and resources values.   5 Conclusions In this study, an MILP model is developed and solved to optimise municipal waste collection routes. This study aims to convert the SWC from a fixed route planning to a variable one with a bin monitoring system as the core element. The optimised route reduced the total driving distance, which in turn decreased the fuel consumption. Consequently, the collection costs and pollutant emissions were diminished. The proposed system demonstrated promising results, with an increase in collection efficiency of 26.08 % and decreases in collection costs and CO2  emissions of 44.44 % and 17.60 %, respectively. The proposed model possesses a huge potential for the proper implementation of SWM. The resulting operational cost saving and emission reduction clearly demonstrate the possible impacts of a real-life optimised route planning using the proposed model. The obtained results of the developed waste collection route optimization model are based on the specific type of bin, location and distribution. However, in practical, the bin types and sizes are different in different cities. Therefore, the performance of route optimization model on the waste collection, cost and emission might have different in different cities which is the limitation of the system. Although this study has taken many factors into consideration such as the number and level of bins, the weight of waste inside bin, vehicle maintenance, frequency of collection, vehicle capacity, and trip rate, some other factors were not considered such as climate and seasonal variations, landforms, number and quality of personnel as well as spatial characteristics of the geographical context which need further analysis. This method is valid to be used by the municipal waste collection system in different countries. However, an implementation test must be done practically. Out of the 17 SDGs, 10 are linked to SWC and management. This study can further strengthen the effort towards the achievement of the 10 SDGs related to SW through the developed route optimisation model.
