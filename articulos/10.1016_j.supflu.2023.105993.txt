The SDGs were adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity. The 17 SDGs are as follows:   Goal 1. No poverty.   Goal 2. Zero hunger.   Goal 3. Good health and well-being.   Goal 4. Quality education.   Goal 5. Gender equality.   Goal 6. Clean water and sanitation.   Goal 7 Affordable and clean energy.   Goal 8. Decent work and economic growth.   Goal 9. Industry, innovation and infrastructure.   Goal 10. Reduce inequality.   Goal 11. Sustainable cities communities.   Goal 12. Responsible consumption and production.   Goal 13. Climate action.   Goal 14. Life below water.   Goal 15. Life on land.   Goal 16. Peace, justice and strong institutions.   Goal 17. Partnerships for the goals. Nowadays, towards the achievement of SDGs, many countries are setting their national targets and various efforts have been performed in industry, academia and governments. Continuous research and development is needed because it is difficult to achieve the SDGs with the technologies currently in practical use. Supercritical fluids and related technologies have high potential to contribute to those matters, such as energy, food, health, industry, and environmental issues. For example, related to Goal 7, 9 and 12, supercritical fluid processes and materials synthesized by supercritical fluid processes enable energy-saving chemical processes. Related to Goal 6, 9, 15, supercritical extraction can remediate the contaminated soil. Related to Goal 6, 12 and 14, supercritical water treatment can contribute to the oxidative decomposition of the hazardous waste and to the conversion of biomass and waste plastics into valuable chemicals or chemical raw materials. In this issue, recent researches on supercritical fluid technologies, targeted on a sustainable society, are presented. The contributions were all peer reviewed and revised according to the standard procedures of the Journal of Supercritical Fluids. We would like to thank all the researchers that have contributed their efforts to make this special issue possible. Their contributions will help for the development of supercritical fluids technologies in various engineering fields concerning the SDGs and for their implementation in industry.
