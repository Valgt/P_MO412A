                  The nitrogen (N) footprint is an index of quantitative determination of nitrogen emissions (all species of N except N2) or the anthropogenic release of reactive nitrogen (Nr). This work evaluates the first assessment of the Nr in Thailand which covers the major human activities, including food, housing, transportation, goods, and services. This study calculated specific virtual nitrogen factors (VNFs) of eight food categories: cereal (rice), vegetable (baby corn), fruit (pineapple), poultry, pork, beef, milk and egg. The system boundary along the food production and consumption chains starts from N fertiliser applied to crops and ends with sewage treatment. Effect of the international trade of food was considered. The results showed that the average per capita N footprint of consumption based on international and national trading in Thailand was 19.07 and 19.33 kg Ncapita−1 yr−1 in 2017. The footprint was dominated by food (11.08−11.35 kg Ncapita−1 yr−1), followed by the sectors of transportation (6.83 kg Ncapita−1 yr−1), housing (0.79 kg Ncapita−1 yr−1), and the goods & services (0.37 kg Ncapita−1 yr−1). 58.13−58.70% of food N consumption in Thailand is from crops. Among crops, rice consumption and production was the major contributor to high food N footprint (34.97−35.26%), followed by poultry (32.65−33.13%). The high domestic consumption and international trade values resulted in the highest rice N footprint (3.87−4.00 kg N capita−1 yr−1), which was moderately 1.40−1.67 times greater than that of other countries (Austria, Australia, the US, and the UK). Thailand has a high value of N footprint for poultry (3.62−3.76 kg N capita−1 yr−1) because of less efficiency of fertiliser use, which was leached to the soil during plantation. The VNFs for crops were 1.10−24.48 while that of livestock products were 0.59−24.77. Similarly, the high VNFs of food crops were caused by a small edible portion of baby corn and pineapple (25.0.7−38.2%) and the inefficiency of N fertiliser use in the production (7.17−9.63%). Our results provide the opportunities to reduce N pollution by increasing N utilisation in food and feed productions, using clean energy sources with potential for fossil energy substitution, and managing dietary structure to reduce N footprint.

Table 1    Authors Objectives Results   Xue and Landis (2010)  This study assessed and evaluated the food nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) footprints in the Gulf of Mexico. This study utilised the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) framework to evaluated eutrophication (N and P) potential over the life cycle of the food production system. Red meat has the highest eutrophication impact, followed by dairy products, chicken/eggs, and fish. The cereal and carbohydrate (cereal/carbs) subgroups were identified to have the lowest nutrient footprint among all food subgroups. Their results proposed that dietary shifts from dairy products (milk) and red meat to cereals can be an effective approach for lowering the personal N footprint.  Chatzimpiros and Barles (2013)  The food N footprint in France was calculated. This study employed the LCA to evaluate the food N footprints of beef, pork, and fresh milk consumption in France. The VNFs for France were comparable to the US production systems Leach et al. (2012)  because French and US systems are similarly industrialized. For pork production, the VNF for France (4.9) was slightly 1.04 times higher than N loss for the US (4.7). For milk and beef productions, the VNFs for France (5.7 for milk and 8.5 for beef) were higher than N losses for US (4.1 for milk and 5.1 for beef), respectively. Their results indicated that N use efficiencies in respect of feeding crop cultivation and manure management between the US and French systems are different.  Gu et al. (2013)  The LCA study was to evaluate N footprint of food, energy, and nonfood in China. Between 1980 and 2008, the N footprint of food, energy, and nonfood (goods) in China was studied. This studied extended the contributor to the N footprint related to N footprint of industrial products. Their results indicated that 70% of N footprint in 2008 was from food N. The proportion of crops used for food was reduced from 94% in 1980 to 40% in 2008. Poultry and milk productions increased from 30% to 47% of total livestock production during the same period. The change of consumption patterns from hog domination to poultry and milk productions represented that the operations largely increased the N loss of livestock because the feed conversion ratio of chicken and milk was about three times greater than that of pork.  Stevens et al. (2014)  The personal N for the United Kingdom (UK) was conducted with two approaches: food and energy N footprints. They reported that the current per capita N footprint in the UK is 27.1 kg N capita-1 . The largest proportion was from N food production, accounting for 18.0 kg N per capita (66.4% of the total N footprint). The energy sector contributed only 4.2 kg N per capita or 15.5% of the total N footprint. This work proposed the test scenarios to estimate the value of the UK N footprint by changing consumption patterns. Their results reported that consuming protein under the levels of FAO and the World Health Organization and vegetarian diet decreased the N footprint by 33% and 15% of the overall N footprint, respectively.  Shibuta et al. (2014)  This study performed the analysis of food N footprint in Japan. In the work, they considered the effect of the international trade of food and feed and the impact of dietary preferences among different consumer age groups. They reported that the Japan VNFs for animal products both with trade (2.7−12.4) and without trade (1.7−27.3) were higher than those for the US (3.2−7.9) and EU (2.9−7.9) countries. The VNFs for milk and vegetables without trade in Japan were also lower than VNFs in the US and EU countries because Japanese production systems are less N intensive than the systems in the US and EU countries. They suggested that improvement of the N use efficiency of livestock was an effective choice to decrease the VNF in the agricultural process. Japan can present lower total N footprint while it is able to produce more fish and seafood, vegetables, and milk in the country. However, the reactive N losses can increase if younger age groups still prefer meats.

Editor: Prof. Carmen Teodosiu The nitrogen (N) footprint is an index of quantitative determination of nitrogen emissions (all species of N except N2 ) or the anthropogenic release of reactive nitrogen (Nr). This work evaluates the first assessment of the Nr in Thailand which covers the major human activities, including food, housing, transportation, goods, and services. This study calculated specific virtual nitrogen factors (VNFs) of eight food categories: cereal (rice), vegetable (baby corn), fruit (pineapple), poultry, pork, beef, milk and egg. The system boundary along the food production and consumption chains starts from N fertiliser applied to crops and ends with sewage treatment. Effect of the international trade of food was considered. The results showed that the average per capita N footprint of consumption based on international and national trading in Thailand was 19.07 and 19.33 kg Ncapita−1  yr−1  in 2017. The footprint was dominated by food (11.08−11.35 kg Ncapita−1  yr−1 ), followed by the sectors of transportation (6.83 kg Ncapita−1  yr−1 ), housing (0.79 kg Ncapita−1  yr−1 ), and the goods & services (0.37 kg Ncapita−1  yr−1 ). 58.13−58.70% of food N consumption in Thailand is from crops. Among crops, rice consumption and production was the major contributor to high food N footprint (34.97−35.26%), followed by poultry (32.65−33.13%). The high domestic consumption and international trade values resulted in the highest rice N footprint (3.87−4.00 kg N capita−1  yr−1 ), which was moderately 1.40−1.67 times greater than that of other countries (Austria, Australia, the US, and the UK). Thailand has a high value of N footprint for poultry (3.62−3.76 kg N capita−1  yr−1 ) because of less efficiency of fertiliser use, which was leached to the soil during plantation. The VNFs for crops were 1.10−24.48 while that of livestock products were 0.59−24.77. Similarly, the high VNFs of food crops were caused by a small edible portion of baby corn and pineapple (25.0.7−38.2%) and the inefficiency of N fertiliser use in the production (7.17−9.63%). Our results provide the opportunities to reduce N pollution by increasing N utilisation in food and feed productions, using clean energy sources with potential for fossil energy substitution, and managing dietary structure to reduce N footprint.

The 232 SDG indicators (IAEG-SDGs, 2016 ) are proposed by the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs), and have recently been approved by the UN Statistical Commission (Sustainable Development Solution Network, 2017 ). The reactive nitrogen (Nr) production footprint (kg per capita) is an important indicator of SDG 12, the responsible consomption and production patterns. Human activities are considerable factor to increase the amount of reactive nitrogen (Nr) into the atmosphere and biosphere because a consequence of increased demand for food and energy (Stevens et al., 2014 ). This reactive nitrogen can cause negative environmental impacts, e.g., climate change, smog formation and eutrophication (Galloway et al. 2003 , 2008 ; Sutton et al., 2011 ). The reactive nitrogen defined as all nitrogen compounds, e.g., nitrous oxide (N2 O), nitrogen oxides (NOX ), ammonia (NH3 ), nitrate (NO3 − ), nitrite (NO2 − ), nitric acid (HNO3 ), urea, amines, proteins, and nucleic acids, but excludes the unreactive N2  (Galloway et al., 2003 ; UNEP & WHRC., 2007 ). This Nr was generated from inert nitrogen (N2 ) through both natural processes (nitrogen fixation by microbes and the intense heat of lighting) and human activities (the production of synthetic fertiliser and the burning of fossil fuels). Increases in nitrogen (N) production over time lead to high losses of N pollution to the environment as a result of Nr footprint from two main sources: (1) food nitrogen (N) footprint (food production and consumption); and (2) energy nitrogen (N) footprint (housing, transportation, goods, and services) (Liang et al., 2016 ). The recent formation from the meeting of the Save Food Network Thailand (SFNET) with Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and Thailand's Office of Agricultural Economics reported that 1.3 billion tons of food, equivalent to 30% of annual food production, are lost or wasted up to 50% of fresh fruits and vegetables from farm to plate every year. 15-20% of food is wasted after served on the dining tables of industrialized Asia. There are many literature reviews reporting environmental assessment of N footprint. Using the N-Calculator model (Leach et al., 2012 ), the N footprint has been studied in many countries (e.g., United States, Netherlands, France, China, Austria, United Kingdom, Japan, and Australia). Detailed information of each literature is given as follow: Leach et al. (2012)  studied food N footprints for a set of eight broad food categories (poultry, pork, beef, milk, vegetables & fruit, potatoes, legumes, and cereals) in the United States (US) and the Netherlands. They presented the first methodology of the N-Calculator, N footprint model or the loss of Nr to the environment. The average per capita N footprints in the US and the Netherlands were found to be 41 kg N capita−1  yr−1  and 25 kg N capita−1  yr−1 , respectively. For food production in the US, the per capita accounted for 30 kg N capita−1  yr−1  (73% of the total N footprint), of which 25 kg N capita−1  yr−1  was lost to the environment before food consumption. And, 5 kg N capita−1  yr−1  was lost to the environment after food consumption (e.g., as human waste). For food production in the Netherlands, the per capita accounted for 22 kg N capita−1  yr−1  (73% of the total N footprint), of which 21 kg N capita−1  yr−1  was lost to the environment before food consumption. The small amount of 1 kg N capita−1  yr−1  was lost to the environment after food consumption because advanced sewage treatment converts most of this Nr into a non-reactive form (N2 ) in the Netherlands. Moreover, this work suggested ways to reduce N loss by changing consumption patterns. They reported that the reduction in meat consumption is a very efficient choice of reducing an N footprint. Pierer et al. (2014)  studied the N footprint of food products in Austria and applied the N-calculator by Leach et al. (2012) . This work estimated the virtual nitrogen factors (VNFs) for a set of product categories (poultry, pork, beef, fish & seafood, milk, vegetables, potatoes, legumes, and cereals). Their results reported that the per capita N footprint in Austria is 19.8 kg N per capita. When compared with N footprint, Austria's VNFs result in the average N footprint that is 16% lower than US and EU countries, and this is because of high difference in the VNFs for vegetables and fruits (Austria 4.3 and US 9.6). The US value of N uptake for ending up in the harvested crop was 20% while Austria's value for the uptake of N in this activity (40%) was 2 times lower than that of the US. Because of the large amounts of milk products and pork consumption in Austria, these two categories dominated by 50% of the total food N footprint. This is due to the fact that recycling rates for slaughter waste and processing waste are lower for Austria. Liang et al. (2016)  studied the N footprint and focused on food (beef) and energy (coal) consumption in Australian 2011, the N footprint per capita in Australia was 47 kg N per year. It was found that the food N footprint was the highest component accounting for 68% of the overall N footprint. For energy sector, 49% of energy N footprint was from electricity consumption, and 69% of electricity was generated from coal. Australia has higher N losses than many countries (the US, the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, Portugal, Austria, and Tanzania) but lower N loss than Japan because of less efficiency of fertiliser used and feed conversion to animals. For beef production, the N loss for Australia (25.2) is much higher than in other countries. Most of Australia's cattle fed grazing outdoor, but the main contributor is the feedlot system because of the large feed requirement and high rate of metabolism in cattle. Other previous N footprint studies are summarised in Table 1  . In Thailand, Office of Agricultural Economics (2015)  reported that the major food productions include seven categories: (1) food crops (rice, cassava and sugarcane), (2) oil crops (oil palm, soybean and coconut), (3) vegetables (garlic, shallot, onion, potato, tomato, and baby corn), (4) fruit trees (pineapple, longan, rambutan, durian, mangosteen, lichee, tangerine, longkong, and lime), (5) perennial trees (coffee and pepper), (6) livestock and products (e.g., cattle, daily-cow, fresh milk, buffalo, swine, broiler, layer hen, and hen egg, negative chicken, meat duck, layer duck and duck egg), and (7) fisheries (marine fishery, fresh water fishery and shrimp). There is a lack of research on the full nitrogen footprint of food products and consumption patterns in Thailand. The objectives of this study are to (1) evaluate the virtual nitrogen factors (VNFs), food and energy N footprints in Thailand based on the effects of the domestic and international trades; (2) to identify the current and safe levels nutrition (protein/N) intake; and (3) to present an appropriate nutrient (N) rates under current soil fertility level for food and feed crops that can useful data to government planner, scientist and farmers. Based on the methodology of Leach et al. (2012) , Thailand VNFs for a set of food categories (rice, pineapple, baby corn, poultry, pork, beef, milk, and egg) were evaluated. The VNFs were transformed into N use efficiency and used for comparisons with other studies. The scope of the study is on the agricultural production process which has the important parameters of various food products including, the amount of fertiliser used, yields for crops, feed to body mass conversion for animals, and N uptake for feed crops. Following processing, distribution, and human consumptions were considered. Finally, this work assessed the total national food N footprint of Thailand, and its result will be applied for supporting future perspectives. This study will provide some information on how individual and collective action can result in the loss of reactive nitrogen to the environment.  2 Method 2.1 Calculation of the N footprint The N footprint includes food and energy consumption (Equation 1) using average per capita for a country. This index was calculation for 2017. The reactive N loss to the environment from the food production and consumption chain was evaluated initially with N fertiliser applied to cropland throughout sewage treatment Fig. 1  ). The food N footprint consists of two main components including (1) food production N footprint and (2) food consumption N footprint. The N footprint and the food N footprint were calculated using Eqs. (1)  and ((2) , respectively.(1) N F = N F f o o d   + N F e n e r g y       (2) N F f o o d   = ∑ N F p r o d i    + ∑ N F c o n s i         Where i is type of food i providing rice, pineapple, baby corn, poultry, pork, beef, milk, and egg. NF is the reactive N loss to the environment (kg N capita−1  yr−1 ). NFprod i  is the food-production N footprint of item i (kg N capita−1  yr−1 ). NFcons i  is the food-consumption N footprint of item i (kg N capita−1  yr−1 ). NFenergy  is the energy N footprint (kg N capita−1  yr−1 ). NFfood  is the food N footprint including the reactive N released to the environment from food production and consumption (kg N capita−1  yr−1 ). 2.1.1 Food production and consumption N footprint Food N footprint was calculated by multiplying the virtual N factor (VNF) or N loss factor by the food N consumed as shown in Eq. (3) . VNF is the total N loss to the environment during food production per unit of N in the consumed food (Leach et al., 2012 ). As stated in other studies, VNF is the rest food or is any N that was used in the food production process, but it is not considered in the final food product that humans consume (N-Print, 2011). The VNF covers all steps and starts from initial fertiliser application during crop plantation to final food consumption. In order to get the assumption of this work, we utilised the information on the VNF relative to food production, which excluded the N losses due to transportation and energy consumption, which were separated. This work calculated Thailand N losses due to food production and consumption systems: cereal (rice), fruit (pineapple), vegetable (baby corn), poultry, pork, beef, milk, and egg. The amount of food N consumed was estimated by using the calculated value for protein consumption and the component of N in protein by mass (Supplementary Table A1).(3) ∑ j  ( N F f o o d i    + N F c o n s i   ) = V N  F i  × N c o n s u m e d i       Where i is type of food i and j is stage j with corresponding number as listed in Fig. 1  for vegetable and meat products. VNFi  is the total N loss to the environment of all process steps in food product i per the summation of consumed N in food i. Nconsumed i is the N content of consumed product i (kg N consumed kg-1  food). Food consumption was calculated by subtracting food waste from Thailand's food supply. The categories of food waste considered in this study include waste at the consumer levels, excluding retailer and food service. The amounts of food waste for eight major food categories are collected from the questionnaire and field interview with people aged 5-60 and over 65 years old in Thailand. The N removal from the sewage stream was considered as a reduction of the food consumption N footprint. The N consumed was excreted and ultimately released to the environment as human waste.  2.1.2 Energy N footprint The calculation of the energy N footprint, housing energy usage, transportation, goods, and services were performed. The four energy components of the N footprint were determined from human routine activities: housing (e.g., the use of electricity and LPG), transportation (e.g., plane, train, rail, bus, and car), goods (e.g., clothing, furniture, and household appliances) and services (e.g., education, insurance, and hospital services). The summation of the bottom-up and top-down approaches were used to calculate the total energy N footprint. A bottom-up approach was applied to calculate the N footprint in two sectors, housing and transportation. For top-down approach, this study used an environmentally extended input-output analysis (EIO) and monetary flows between sectors that distribute Thailand environmentally extended input-output analysis (EIO) and monetary flows between sectors (Leach et al., 2012 ; Kitzes, 2013 ). The energy N footprint is presented the summation of N losses in four parts: housing, transportation, goods, and services. The amount of N released from transportation was estimated, including: 1) gasoline and natural gas for vehicles (NGV) were consumed by car, 2) diesel was consumed by truck, and 3) jet fuel consumed by airplane, resulting from the growth in tourism sector in Thailand (Ministry of Energy, 2018 ). Thailand households consumed energy mostly in the forms of electricity (Ministry of Energy, 2018 ). This study presumed that the values of N emissions of goods and services sectors were from personal consumption in the form of electricity.   2.2 Incorporation of food imports and exports into the N footprint The VNF incorporated the effect of international trade of each food was calculated using Eq. (4) . The total N loss to the environment during the food production including international trade was applied the food balance sheet (FBS) providing by Food and Agricultural Organizatiion of United Nations (Food and Agricultural Organizatiion, 2001 ) and evaluated the N loss from the total domestic food supply (TDS). According to FBS, the total domestic food supply (TDS) incorporated international trade which was evaluated using Eq. (5)  from four main soureces providing production, change in stocks, imports, and exports.(4) VN F prod _ with  trade  i   = N F TDS _ with  trade  i   / Ncon sume d TDS _ with  trade  i       (5) TD S with  trade  i   = Prod uctio n i  + Chan ge  in  Stoc k i  + Impor t i  − Expor t i       Where VNFprod_with trade i  is the total N loss to the environment of all process steps in food product i incorporate with the effect of international trade per the summation of consumed N in food i. N consumedTDS_with trade i  is the N content of consumed food product i incorporate with international trade (kg N consumed kg−1  vegetable product or kg N consumed kg−1  animal product). NFTDS_with trade i  is the N loss during each process step in food product i incorporate with international trade (kg N loss kg−1  vegetable product or kg N loss kg−1  animal product). TDSwith trade i  is total amount of domestic food i supply incorporate with international trade including production, change in stocks, imports and exports (ton per year). Productioni  is the amount of domestic food production i (ton per year) in year 2017 (Supplementary Table A3). Change in stocki  is the change in stocks of food i occuring during the reference period (in year 2017) at all levls from production to retail stage (ton per year) (Supplementary Table A5). Importi  and Exporti  are the amount of movements of food i into inside and outsid country (ton per year) (Supplementary Table 4). The VNF excluded the effect of international trade, which was calculated using Eq. (6) . Total domestic supply (TDS) without the effect of international trade containing production and change in stocks, which was calcualted using Eq. (7) .(6) VN F prod _ with out  trade  i   = N F TDS _ with out  trade  i   / Ncon sume d TDS _ with out  trade  i       (7) TD S with out  trade  i   = Prod uctio n i  + Chan ge  in  Stoc k i       Where VNFprod_without trade i  is the total N loss to the environment of all process steps in food product i without the effect of international trade per the summation of consumed N in food i. N consumedTDS_without trade i  is the N content of consumed food product i without the effect of international trade (kg N consumed kg−1  vegetable product or kg N consumed kg−1  animal product). NFTDS_without trade i  is the N loss during each process step in food product i without the effect of international trade (kg N loss kg−1  vegetable product or kg N loss kg−1  animal product). TDSwithout trade i  is total amount of domestic food i supply without the effect of international trade containg production and change in stocks (ton per year).  2.3 Average per capita N footprint in Thailand The per capita footprint is defined as the total amount of N losses to the environment as a result of entity consumption patterns of citizen each country that presented as the summation of threes sources: food production, food consumption, and energy sectors (Leach et al., 2012; Pierer et al., 2017 ). From Eq. (1) , the average per capita N footprint in Thailand in year 2017 was calculated from the total amount of reactive N loss to the environment as a result of food with and without international trade and energy consumption per the number of inhabitants (66,188,503 people) in a specific region. This index was used in comparisons with other studies.  2.4 Data collection The data collection of N footprint assessment was carried out by collecting necessary information from various sources, i.e., on-site interviews, domestic research reports, international reports, journals, and government publications, etc. Details of each available data source are given as follow: 2.4.1 Data collection for food production For food production, N footprint accounts for all N lost during the food production processes. Six N parameters of the crop production processes, including percentage of available N uptake by the plant, (2) percentage of edible crop N produced as food products (3) percentage of plant N retained in edible part including processing and distribution retain, (4) percentage of residual N recycled, (5) percentage of processing and distribution waste N and (6) percentage of crop products N consumed, were available from secondary sources and collected from filed-interviewed farmers (Supplementary Tables A7, A9, A11 and A12). Ten N parameters of animals production (meats and dairy) processes, including (1) percentage of available N uptake by plant, (2) percentage of plant N retained in animal feed, (3) percentage of residual N recycled, (4) percentage of feed N digested by live animals, (5) percentage of feed waste and excreted N recycled, (6) percentage of live animals N stayed in carcasses, (7) percentage of slaughter waste N recycled, (8) percentage of carcasses N produced as meat products, (9) percentage of processing waste N recycled, and (10) percentage of meat products N consumed, were available data in many studies and similar to the crop production process (Supplementary Tables A8, A10, A11 and A12). Data during the agricultural process (e.g., fertiliser N used for food or feed, N fixation of feed crops, crops yield, feed and conversion ratio for animals) are shown in Supplementary Table A7−A8 and collected from Office of Agricultural Economics, Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Animal Nutrition Development (Department of Livestock Development), primary and secondary sources.  2.4.2 Data collection for food consumption For the study in Thailand, the food consumption components were adopted by using primary data and secondary data. The study began with the secondary information collection. The protein content recorded in Thailand was supplemented from nutritive values of Thai foods (Bureau of Nutrition, 2018 ) and estimated by using proximate analysis (Supplementary Table A1). Absorption efficiency or digestibility percentage of protein was evaluated by using total N absorbed (total N of food minus N content of excrement) to total N consumed, and amounted to about 95% (Russell and Yonge, 1975 ). The average rate of denitrification at sewage treatment plants in Thailand was retrieved from Pollution Control Department (2018) , which was applied with the calculation of the waste excretion of the human metabolism model (Munoz et al., 2007 ). Then, the primary data information collection of average food waste was supplemented from the questionnaire (Supplementary material C), communication through field interview with people in Thailand. The personal information of respondents, including age (people aged between 3.5-65 years and over 65 years), sex, region, province, area (inside and outside the municipality), religion, weight, and height, were collected. To estimate the reliabilities of the food wastes, the population sample was determined by the minimum calculation for the purpose of confidence level according to Taro Yamane's formulation (Itthisiriwat, 2008 ). The 95% confidence level of the population sample was used and it meant that the significance level of the sample group was 5%.  2.4.3 Data collection for energy consumption The total energy N footprint in year 2017 is presented the summation of N losses in four parts: housing, transportation, goods and services. A bottom-up approach was applied to calculate the N footprint for major areas of N consumption in two sectors, housing and transportation. Thailand households consumed energy in the form of electricity. In 2017, the total electricity consumption was at 185,124 GWh, the proportion of electricity used in residential sector was 185,124 GWh which accounted for 24% (Ministry of Energy, 2018 ). For transportation, oil price was the sources with a proportion of 46.0% and 64.0% for natural gas (NG) for vehicles (NGV). The majority of oil consumption came from diesel (57%), followed by gasoline (37%), and jet fuel (6%) (Ministry of Energy, 2018 ). The amount of N released from transportation was estimated, including: 1) gasoline and NGV were consumed by car, 2) diesel was consumed by truck, and 3) jet fuel consumed by airplane. Information on prices of energy, the gasoline price was the greatest cost of all fuels of 37.46 THB/kg, followed by the diesel price of 28.18 THB/kg, LPG price of 24.45 THB/kg (Bank of Thailand, 2017 ), NGV 13.16 THB/kg (Ministry of Energy, 2017 ) and jet fuel 11.18 THB/kg (Index mundi, 2017 ).  2.4.4 Data collection for indirect energy In this study, the top-down approach (EIO-LCA for the energy N in year 2017) is employed to calculate the amount of energy used in two sectors, goods and services. A top-down approach was used to calculate emissions of energy N of the remaining sectors according to the personal consumption (Kitzes, 2013 ). Information on national economy, e.g, Thailand gross domestic product (GDP), and Input-Output Tables (I-O Tables), was available from the Office of the National Economic and Social Development Board or NESDB(The National Economic and Social Development, 2015) . This study uses 16 × 16 sectors from 1995−2015 to calculate the economiy's consumption matrix [A] for each year. The Leontief's inverse matrix of each year reflected the total direct comsumption required to meet per unit final demand. The matrix total output [X] for Thailand of each year was estimated by multiplying in the final demand with inverse Leontief matices for each sector (Supplementary Table A13). The total output for year 2017 was forecast using historical data with method of least squares for estimating the regression coefficients( y = β 0  + β 1  x ;  x = year ,  y = total  outp ut  year  2017 )    and was shown in Supplementary Table A14. The analysis of variance was used to test for significance of regression ( β 1  )   . The F-statistic was used for testing the hypothesis with 95% confidence level (Montgomery and Runger, 1999 ). Then, the total output was applied with assessing the amount of N release using information of the summary of energy statistics, factors for energy calculation (energy contents) and prices of energy, which was mainly retrieved from the Energy Policy and Planning Office, Ministry of Energy (2018). The commercial price from Thai electricity grid mixed, the price for specific business and service was 4.35 THB/kWh and price for residental was 4.42 THB/kWh (Provincial Electricity Authority, 2018 ). The assumptions for the production chains of eight food commodity and energy consumption in Thailand are presented as follows: The weight and portion size of individual food consumption in Thailand was reported in Supplementary Table A2. The average nutritive value of local protein sources for the feed of chicken, chicken egg, swine, beef and dairy cattle were reported in Supplementary Table A6. For food crops, data during the agricultural process including N fertiliser use and crops yield of rice, pineapple and baby corn, were collected and reported (Supplementary Table A7). The average yield of rice plantation was 2.84 tons per hectare (Office of Agricultural Economics, 2017a ) and the amount of fertiliser N used was 0.016 ton per ton rice (Department of Agricultural Extension, 2017 ). The average crop yield and input fertiliser used for a life cycle pineapple plantation and harvesting were 25.63 tons per hectare (Office of Agricultural Economics, 2017a) and 0.044 ton per ton pineapple (Malakul, 2016 ). The input N fertiliser and the average yield were accounted on baby corn plantation were 8.87 tons per hectare (Department of Agriculture, 2018 ) and 0.047 tons per ton baby corn (Office of Agricultural Economics, 2017b ), respectively. Data during the agricultural process of feed crops including N fertiliser use and crops yield of corn, soybean and napier grass were reported in Supplementary Table A7. The average yield of corn plantation was 2.91 tons per hectare and the amount of fertiliser N used was 0.02 ton per ton corn (Nakhon Sawan Field Crops Research Center, 2018 ). The average crop yield and input fertiliser used for soybean plantation was 1.79 tons per hectare and 0.01 ton per ton soybean (Horticultural Science Society of Thailand, 2018 ). The average yield was accounted on napier grass plantation of 65.63 tons per hectare and the amount of input N fertiliser was 0.001 tons per ton napier grass (Ministry of Energy, 2013 ), respectively. The primary data related to canned pineapple factory was collected the on-site field interview, in the province of Ratchaburi located in the west of Thailand. The wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) operation was performed using upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB). This technique provides a high efficiency of WWTP with approximately 90% (Pollution Control Department, 2020 ) The primary data related to the average food waste (%) with the population samples was collected and reported in Supplementary Table A12. The summation of the bottom-up (housing and transportation sectors) and top-down (goods and services sectors) approaches were adopted to calculate the total energy N footprint. The total output in two sectors − goods and services year 2017 − was forecast using regression analysis in Supplementary Table A14. This study presumed that the value of electricity was 100% of the total output for Thailand goods and services sectors year 2017.    3 Results and discussion 3.1 N footprint and virtual N factors (VNFs) in Thailand The N pollution, the relating N footprint to the mass of food  , the protein content  , and the virtual N factors were investigated. Figs. 2  and 3  presented the results of N footprint for eight food commodity items under average Thailand production conditions based on the N loss per mass of food and N loss per protein content, respectively. Poultry has the highest N footprint per kg (256−803 g N kg food−1 ) of all studied eight food categories. This is followed by baby corn (77.8−90.1 g N kg food−1 ), beef (87.4−88.4 g N kg food−1 ), egg (65.7−66.3 g N kg food−1 ), pork (49.3−49.7 g N kg food−1 ), milk (33.4−34.3 g N kg food−1 ), and rice (11.4−22.1 g N kg food−1 ). Pineapple has a small footprint of only 7.9−11.03 g N kg food−1 . The comparison of the N footprint to the mass for eight major food categories in Thailand is presented in Fig. 2 , which indicated that the value of N footprint of poultry with international trade (803.1 g N per kg food consumed) was strongly higher than that from the poultry with domestic trade (256.1 g N per kg food consumed) by 68.12% according to the high amount of trading, which was 783,700 ton poultry (Supplementary Table A4). With regard to large scale trading, the annual poultry intake from international trade (309,915 tons and Supplementary B Figs. 1 (g)) was lower than the value found for annual poultry intake from domestic trade (1,065,168 tons and Supplementary B Figs. 1 (h)), which accounted for 70.9%. The total Nr loss to the environment along the production chains of poultry with international trade (239,533 ton N and Supplementary B Figs. 2 (g)) was 0.8% small lower than that from the poultry with domestic trade (241,473 ton N and Supplementary B Figs. 2 (h)). When focusing on the protein content related footprint, the ranking was different. With international trade, poultry has the highest N footprint per kg protein (4,118.3 g N kg protein−1 ), while milk has the smallest that of 127 g N kg protein−1 . It is implied that the ranking of the environmental impact of N emissions for each food was changing because of relating N footprint to the mass of food or protein content. The VNFs represented the total Nr losses to the environment along the food production chain per amount of N in food consumption, considerably with food type (Leach et al., 2012 ). The Thailand's VNFs of crops product ranged from 2.1. for rice to 19.91 and 24.48 for pineapple and baby corn (Table 2   and Supplementary Figure 3B). Considering animals product, poultry has the highest VNF (24.77), followed by egg (2.81), beef (2.67), pork (1.59), and the milk (0.63) which presented the lowest VNF. Without incorporating trade decreased the VNFs for six food categories: poultry (70.57%), rice (45.77%), pineapple (27.62%), baby corn (13.56%), milk (6.35%), pork (1.26%) and egg (0.71%). According to the five major livestock species of food commodity in Thailand, the VNF of poultry was strongly influenced by a large scale trading because poultry is the main food commodity for exportation (Supplementary Table A4) while other are produced for domestic consumption. However, corporation trade increased the VNFs for beef (1.50%) because of a relatively high trade for accessing import (Supplementary Table A4).  3.2 Per capita N footprint in Thailand The per capita N footprints between international and domestic trades in Thailand were 19.07 and 19.33 kg N capita−1  yr−1  in 2017. The food portion of the N footprint was 11.08−11.35 kg Ncapita−1  yr−1 , with the food production contribution of 95−97% and food consumption contribution of 3−5%. Next, 62.8% and 63.1% of the food N footprint with and without trades were from animal products (Fig. 4  ), where the main contributors were poultry (32.65−33.13%) and beef (11.01-11.43%). For crop products, rice (cereal product) was found to have the highest N footprint at 3.87−4.00 kg Ncapita−1  yr−1  (35.26−34.97%), followed by pineapple at N footprint at 0.14 kg N capita−1  yr−1  (1.25−1.28%) and baby corn which contribute the lowest impact at 0.07 kg Ncapita−1  yr−1  (0.61−0.63%). In the energy sector, the total energy N footprint was 7.98 kg N capita−1  yr−1  (Fig. 7 ). The largest sector contributing to the energy N footprint was transportation (6.83 kg N capita−1  yr−1 ). Household energy consumption contributes 0.79 kg Ncapita−1  yr−1  and goods & services contribute 0.37 kg N capita−1  yr−1 . The NG consumption was the main cause of the total energy N footprint which accounted for 80.62% of the total N losses for the energy sector (Fig. 5−7   ). Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (2009)  reported that the majority of fossil energy resources of Thai electricity grid included NG (75.70%), coal (11.8%), lignite (12.86%) and fossil oil (0.48%). The reactive N release mainly came from air emission (Fig. 7  (a) and Fig. 7 (b)) because of anthropogenic nitrogen oxide emission from the combustions of petroleum, particularly coal and power generation which are predominantly NOx compounds (Olable and Slep, 2003 ). Therefore, reducing activities that require the use of fossil and increasing renewable energy resources to substitute fossil fuels would decrease the total energy N footprint (Shibata et al., 2014  ; Liang et al., 2016 ). According to Food and Agriculture Organization report (2013) , the value accepted for the safe level of intake for adults was 0.66 g protein/kg body weight per day. The protein requirement of Thai population based on Thailand's Dietary Reference Intake (DRI), the acceptable range of body weight, based on the 19−70 year aged group of 48.5−53 kg for female and 56.2−61.3 kg for male, was 1 g (kg−1  day−1 ) (Thai Dietetic Association, 2020 ). The recommended consumption of annual N intake was calculated to be 3.85 kg N capita−1  yr−1  based on FAO (2013) and 3.56 kg N capita−1  yr−1  based on Thai Dietetic Association (2020). Thai people consumed 3.54 kg N capita−1  yr−1  for international trade and 5.72 kg N capita−1  yr−1  for national trade (Table 2 ). These results indicated that the per-capita protein consumption in Thailand is in line with the values of recommended consumption by FAO (2013) and Thai Dietetic Association (2020).  3.3 Thailand and other countries The per capita N footprints with and without trade in Thailand were 19.07 and 19.33 kg N capita−1  yr−1  in 2017. Thailand has the lowest N footprint when compared with the eight countries (29.8−49.9 kg N capita−1  yr−1 ) by using N-calculator model to calculate N footprint (Fig. 7 ). However, the case of Tanzania is the exception (15.2 kg N capita−1  yr−1 ). For all countries, the general highest portion of the N footprint is food production (55.9−78.9%). By comparing the partition of the N footprint associated with food production, the latest study in Thailand revealed 55.9−56.60% of the total N footprint which was in line with other countries obtained in the study by Leach et al. (2012) , Pierer et al. (2014) , Shibata et al. (2014) , Stevens et al. (2014) , Liang et al. (2016) , and Hutton et al. (2017) . Rice was the largest component of the total food N footprint (34.97 − 35.26%) among eight food categories because it has the highest rate of domestic production of 31.8 million tons in 2017 (Supplementary Table A3) and relative rice's VNF at 2.12 and 1.10 (Table 2 , Fig. 4 , Supplementary B Figs. 1 (a)-1(b), 2(a)-2(b) and 3(a)-3(b)). For livestock production, Thailand's food N footprint has the highest values of poultry’ s VNF of 7.29 and 24.77 with domestic production of 3.67 million tons in 2017 (Supplementary Table A3). The portion of the food N footprint from poultry was 32.65 − 33.13% (Table 2 , Fig. 4 , Supplementary B Figs. 1 (g)-1(h), 2(g)-2(h) and 3(g)-3(h)). Thailand appears to have the lowest N footprint associated with food consumption of 0.29−0.54 kg N capita−1  yr−1  (1.52−2.79% of the total N footprint), compared with developed countries of 4.9− 6.0 kg N capita−1  yr−1  (10−21% of the total N footprint) (Fig. 7 ). Based on food N consumption, the value of Thailand's N footprint was in line with Tanzania's N footprint of 2.0 kg N capita−1  yr−1  which was reported by Hutton et al. (2017) . The low N footprint was primarily due to two reasons. The first is low level of food waste in Thailand which were 3.53−5.0% for food crops (rice, pineapple and baby corn) and by 0.63−5.82% for livestock with daily products (poultry, pork, beef, milk and eggs) (Supplementary Table A12). However, a high level of food waste for beef was 11% which was moderately higher than that which was obtained in FAO study (5% food waste) (Gustavsson et al., 2011 ). The second is a high level of sewage treatment efficiency that removes high amount of consumed N from being released into the environment. Despite the sewage treatment efficiency, the average rate of the reactive N removal factor was 50% at sewage treatment plants in Thailand (Pollution Control Department, 2018), which was lower than the reactive N removal factor of developed counties (60−79%) (Liang et al., 2016 ). The amount of N consumed as food in Thailand by international trade was 3.53 kg N capita−1  yr−1  (Table 2 ) which was similar to that in Japan (3.7 kg N capita−1  yr−1 ) but it was different from that in other developed countries such as in the U.S. (4.77 kg N capita−1  yr−1 ) (Leach et al., 2012 ), UK (4.53 kg Ncapita−1  yr−1 ) (Stevens et al., 2014 ), Australia (4.48 kg N capita−1  yr−1 ) (Liang et al., 2016 ), and Austria (4.72 kg N capita−1  yr−1 ) (Pierer et al., 2014 ). However, Thailand's food N consumption was higher than that in a developing country like in Tanzania (2.73 kg N capita−1  yr−1 ). For the energy sector, Thailand has the highest energy N footprint (7.98 kg N capita−1  yr−1 ) when compared with comparison the seven countries (1.20−4.70 kg N capita−1  yr−1 ), except for U.S. (11.50 kg N capita−1  yr−1 ) and U.S. (14.60 kg N capita−1  yr−1 ). The largest sector contributing to the energy N footprint is transportation (6.83 kg Ncapita−1  yr−1 ) which was many times higher than Japan (0.7 kg Ncapita−1  yr−1 ), Tanzania (0.8 kg Ncapita−1  yr−1 ), UK, Netherland (1.1 kg Ncapita−1  yr−1 ), Austria (1.6 kg Ncapita−1  yr−1 ), Germany (1.8 kg Ncapita−1  yr−1 ), Australia (1.9 kg Ncapita−1  yr−1 ), and US (6.0 kg Ncapita−1  yr−1 ). The highest portion of energy N footprint corresponded to NG consumption with the emission of 6.43 kg N capita−1  yr−1  or contributing 82.27% to the total energy N footprint transporation sector and 80.62% to the total energy N footprint. Note that NG has the highest N emission (4.99 × 10−3  kg N/kg NG), followed by gasoline (1.11 × 10−3  kg N/kg gasoline), jet fuel (9.78 × 10−4  kg N/kg jet fuel), LPG (6.79 × 10−4  kg N/kg LPG), and diesel (5.05 × 10−4  kg N/kg diesel) (Ecoinvent 2006 ). The per-capita N footprint of Thailand in 2017 from electricity is reasonably low at 1.13 kg N capita−1  yr−1 , compared to 7.5 N capita−1  yr−1 for Australia, 3.7 N capita−1  yr−1  for the U.S. and 1.8 N capita−1  yr−1 . The results show that the electricity N footprint of housing (residential) sector (0.79 N capita−1  yr−1 ) was the highest (Ministry of Energy, 2018 )), followed by service sector (0.33 N capita−1  yr−1 ), and goods (0.038 N capita−1  yr−1 ), contributing 67.9%, 28.8% and 3.3%, respectively. The most differences between Thaland's N footprint and the N footprint of developed countries are in N energy and food N consumption. 58.13−58.7% of N consumption in Thailand was from food crop (Table 2 ), and rice is the main contributor. Rice consumption by Thai people both international and domestic trade was 1.10−2.12 and 1.00−4.26 times higher than the consumption by the Australian, Austrian, British Japanese, and Tanzanian. The high consumption and high international trade values resulted in Thailand having the highest rice N footprint (3.87−4.00 kg N capita−1  yr−1 ), which was moderately greater than that of other countries. The cases of Japan (4.35 kg N capita−1  yr−1 ) and Tanzania (9.14 kg N capita−1  yr−1 ) are the exception. For poultry product, the portion of N edible crops uptake for feed was 75% in the US and 67% in Australia and the portion of N retained chicken was 75% in the US and 47% in Australia (Leach et al., 2012 ; Liang et al., 2016 ). The portion of N edible crop uptake for feed crop was 40.51% while the portion of N retained chicken was 2.63% in Thailand. This value increased the VNFs (7.29−24.77) which primarily due to the extensively high amount of N leaching to soil (64.49%) and N loss of excretion in the live animal (19.98%) (Supplementary B Figs. 3 (g) and 3(h)). Improving the nutrient use efficiency of feed crops, especially in fertliser uptake in plants, would reduce Thailand'a NVF for poultry. For beef and milk productions, the N loss for Thailand (0.09−1.29 kg N capita−1  yr−1 ) was much lower than that for other countries (1.92−5.81 kg N capita−1  yr−1 ). This is due to Thailand's production systems evaluated the environmental benefits obtained from intensive N fixation from soybean (Siripin, 2005 ) and N leaching from napiar grass for Thailand's cattle feed (Supplementary Table A6−A7). The high yield of feed crops in napier grass of 65.63 tons per hectare (Ministry of Energy, 2013 ) revealed a positive trend from viewpoint of N footprint of beef and milk products (Supplementary Table A7). However, the N footprint of beef (0.98 kg N capita−1  yr−1 ) and milk (1.66 kg N capita−1  yr−1 ) in Tanzania was similar to that in Thailand because 90% of the nutrition requirements of cattle are met by grazing on unfertilised (natural grassland) (Hutton et al., 2017 ). In Thailand, dairy cattle and chicken egg were utilised as beef and poultry after they are no longer useful for milk and egg. The calculation of N production for milk was connected to beef as a co-product (Supplementary B Figs. 1 (m)−1(n), 2(m)−2(n), and 3(m)−3(n)). Similarly, the production of eggs was relatively connected to the production of poultry (Supplementary B Figures 1(o)−1(p), 2(o)−2(p), and 3(o)−3(p)). Therefore, incorporating dairy meat into the milk and chicken egg into egg would reduce VNFs and N footprint. For food crops, the Thailand VNFs with international trade were higher than that of other countries (Table 2 ). The VNFs of pineapple (fruit) and baby corn (vegetable) in Thailand were 34−79% and 61−83% higher when compared with other countries (Austria, Australia, Japan, the US, and the UK). In the detail analysis of comparative VNFs of vegetable in Thailand, Australia and the US, the portion of N uptake is 80% in the US and 44% in Australia (Leach et al., 2012 ; Liang et al., 2016 ), while the portion of N uptake in Thailand was 15.5−15.7% (Supplementary Table A9, Supplementary B Figs. 1 (e)−1(f), 2(e)−2(f), and 3(e)−3(f)). Similarly, the portion of N uptake of fruits was 87−90% in the U.S. and 70% in Australia, while only 14.56% of that in Thailand (Supplementary Table A9, Supplementary B Figures 1(c)−1(d), 2(c)−2(d), and 3(c)−3(d)). The portion of N uptake related to cereals was 95% in the US and 77% in Australia, while the corresponding value in Thailand was 45.27% (Supplementary Table A9, Supplementary B Figures 1(a)−1(b), 2(a)−2(b), and 3(a)−3(b)). This implied that the inefficiency of N fertiliser used in the food production phase because of a high amount of N fertiliser application and leaching effect of N to the soil. N uptake related to vegetable in the US is higher in Thailand because N uptake in the US applying appropriate nutrient (N) rates under current soil fertility level, the drip irrigation system (soluble N into the soil), the topdressing and sidedressing N are an effective way to fertilise (University of Maryland Extension. 2020a, 2020b ; University of Massachusetts Amherst, 2020 ). However, the influence of the total food N footprint from baby corn (0.069−0.07 kg N capita−1  yr−1 ) and pineapple (0.14 kg N capita−1  yr−1 ) was very low, accounting for 1.57% of the total food N footprint values (Table 2 ). This was because baby corn and pineapple have a moderate rate of domestic production of 1.95 and 0.24 million tons in 2017 (Supplementary Table A3) and relatively low composition of protein in baby corn (2.30% crude protein) and pineapple (0.3−0.54% crude protein) products (Supplementary Table A1). Despite the crop processing retainment, the small edible portion of pineapple and baby corn were 38.2% and 25.0%, respectively (Supplementary Table A9). Recycling waste to fertiliser was necessary and beneficial to prove the implications policy of further municipal waste. In our study, it is highly recommended that the improvement in food crops supply chains should be addressed. It is because the Nr loss during the food production stage contributes over 90% of the total food N footprint. This implied the inefficiency of N fertiliser use in the production (whole crop uptake). This analysis might be used for providing appropriate performance from agrochemical use particularly N fertiliser use related to crop yields. The results considerably recommended that the background on the scientific approaches in food consumption patterns, N loss of plant-based product, should be supported in regional and national policies to manage N losses to reduce the total N footprint.   4 Conclusion The first approach to assess N footprint for energy and food production consumption in Thailand in the year 2017 was carried out. This work focuses on the contribution of N footprint of four sources: food, housing, transportation, and goods & services. The influence of international food trade on the N footprint was also investigated. Thailand virtual N factors (VNFs) for a set of eight food categories, including rice, pineapple, baby corn, poultry, pork, beef, milk, and egg, were evaluated. The total N footprints in Thailand were 19.07 kg Ncapita−1  yr−1  for international trade and 19.33 kg Ncapita−1  yr−1  for national trade. Thailand has the lowest total N footprint when compared with other countries (24.2−49.9 kg Ncapita−1  yr−1 ) except for developing countries like in Tanzania (15.2 kg N capita−1  yr−1 ). The food N footprints were 11.08−11.35 kg N capita−1  yr−1  with the food production contribution of 95−97%. The high contributors of the total food N footprint corresponded to rice (3.87−4.00 kg Ncapita−1  yr−1 ) and poultry (3.62−3.76 kg N capita−1  yr−1 ), contributing 34.97−35.26% and 32.65−33.13% to the total food N footprint, respectively. The Thailand's VNFs of crops product were 2.12, 19.91, 24.48 for rice, pineapple and baby corn, respectively. The livestock products − poultry has the highest VNF (24.77), followed by egg (2.81), beef (2.67), pork (1.59), and milk (0.63). For domestic trade, the VNFs for six food categories decreased: poultry (71%), rice (48.11%), pineapple (27.6%), baby corn (13.56%), milk (6.35%), pork (1.26%), and egg (0.71%). For poultry and rice, the VNFs and N footprint were strongly influenced by a large scale trading, high domestic consumption and less efficiency of fertiliser use for food and feed crops. In the energy sector, the total energy N footprint was 7.98 kg N capita−1  yr−1 . The NG consumption was the main cause of the total energy N footprint which accounted for 80.62% of the total N losses for the energy sector. Because NG has the highest N emission when compared with other conventional fuels (jet fuel, and gasoline, diesel and LPG). Because the values Thailand's N uptake in cereal (rice), fruit (pineapple) and vegetable (baby corn), and feed crops for chicken (poultry) are moderately low when compared with other developed countries. The obtained results are intended to support the strategy for increasing the Thailand's N uptake in food and feed crops by enhancing the efficiency of fertiliser use during crop production, such as applying appropriate nutrient rates under current soil fertility level, topdressing, and sidedressing tecnologies. For livestock products, the results provide the reasonable choices and issues to decrease N footprint by concerning the benefits obtained of alternative feed crops, including soybean and napier grass. This was because of the intensive N fixation from soybean, high crop yield and grazing on unfertilised in napier grass. Financial support should be provided for applying technologies and knowledge that can help farmers reduce N pollution. The results also evaluate the opportunities to reduce N pollution by consuming what food products relatively high amount of nutrition content and relatively low VNFs. This work proposed that dietary choices from five products, including rice, pork, beef, egg, and milk, can be an effective approach for lowering the personal N footprint. Because an annual N intake based on the effect of international trade from rice, pork, beef, egg, and milk products was calculated to be 3.38 kg N capita−1  yr−1 (contributing 95% of the current Thailand‘s total annual N intake), and decreased Thailand’ s food N footprint by 35.4% (3.97 kg N capita−1  yr−1 ). However, the influence of annual N intake from international trade (3.53 kg N capita−1  yr−1 ) was lower than that of the safe level of the recommendation nutrition intake (3.65 kg N capita−1  yr−1 ). The results indicated the importance of policies to control the the amount of movements of food into outside country, particularly rice which was dietary choice relatively high amount of nutrition content and relatively low Thailand's VNF. In term of energy N footprint, it is crucial to substitute conventional fossil fuels with renewable energy for decreasing the energy component of the N footprint that may useful data to support the future issue for government's plans of the National Alternative Energy Development Plan in Thailand. There are two major approaches for further research. The first study could combine the other environmental indexes of food products related to carbon, water, and phosphorus footprints. The second study could involve the expansion of the other food productions in Thailand such as vegetables (garlic, onion, and tomato), livestock and products (meat duck and duck egg), fisheries (nile tilapia and shrimp).
