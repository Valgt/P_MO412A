                  Under the rapid economic development trend, exploring the resource optimization strategy of cultural and creative enterprises for sustainable socio-economic development is highly relevant. This study applies the recommendation system to decision-making and resource optimization of entrepreneurial projects for the current situation of complexs entrepreneurial enterprises in the cultural and creative industry (CCI). The neural network algorithm (NNA) is adopted to model project features, user's behavioral and content features. Finally, a recommendation and resource optimization model based on NNA is constructed for CCI-related entrepreneurial projects, and the model is evaluated and analyzed. The results demonstrate that with the increase in the training period, the model's recognition accuracy reaches 81.64%. Besides, the prediction error of the recommender system is minimized when the word vector length is 200, and the number of implied features is 200. Therefore, the entrepreneurial project recommendation and resource optimization model can significantly improve the recognition accuracy and reduce prediction errors, providing experimental references and contributing to the subsequent sustainable development of social economy and entrepreneurial resource optimization.

Under the rapid economic development trend, exploring the resource optimization strategy of cultural and creative enterprises for sustainable socio-economic development is highly relevant. This study applies the recommendation system to decision-making and resource optimization of entrepreneurial projects for the current situation of complexs entrepreneurial enterprises in the cultural and creative industry (CCI). The neural network algorithm (NNA) is adopted to model project features, user's behavioral and content features. Finally, a recommendation and resource optimization model based on NNA is constructed for CCI-related entrepreneurial projects, and the model is evaluated and analyzed. The results demonstrate that with the increase in the training period, the model's recognition accuracy reaches 81.64%. Besides, the prediction error of the recommender system is minimized when the word vector length is 200, and the number of implied features is 200. Therefore, the entrepreneurial project recommendation and resource optimization model can significantly improve the recognition accuracy and reduce prediction errors, providing experimental references and contributing to the subsequent sustainable development of social economy and entrepreneurial resource optimization.

As a result, the pressure of employment competition is constantly growing, making the social employment situation increasingly severe. Relevant data shows that the number of college graduates in China has increased from 5.754 million in 2010 to nearly 9 million in 2020, but the employment rate of college graduates was only about 70%. As China's economic development enters a new normal, the demand for independent innovation capability is constantly rising. The recommendation and resource optimization of many types of complex entrepreneurial projects, which promotes the economic restructuring and industrial upgrading, is an inevitable trend for sustainable economic development (Sharma et al., 2021a ; Bansal et al., 2022a ; Bouncken et al., 2021 ). Therefore, the Ministry of Education has promoted innovation and entrepreneurship education (IEE) reform in colleges and universities to meet the needs of sustainable economic development and improve the quality of entrepreneurship and employment of college graduates(Sharma et al., 2021a,b,c,d ). Meanwhile, resource optimization of cultural and creative enterprises has also become the focus of many scholars in related fields. In the interconnected era, various large-scale cultural and artistic events in China have increased in spurts. Meanwhile, comprehensive planning and construction of cultural performance venues have been carried out, fully reflecting the importance China attaches to the cultural and creative industry (CCI) and its determination to optimize the development of its resources in a comprehensive manner (Boubker et al., 2021 ). In the report of the National People's Congress, the goal of building a âstrong socialist cultural stateâ in 2011 has been changed to âmaking the cultural industry a pillar industry of the national economy by 2020â as a clear goal for the sustainable economic development of CCI in the near future (Jena, 2020 ; Sharma et al., 2021b ). Against this background, it is urgent to research and analyze the current situation of college students' CCI-related entrepreneurship. College students are a particular group in the entrepreneurial army. They have a high education level and are receptive to new things. They become leading force in the CCI entrepreneurial teams. Moreover, the reform of IEE in Chinese colleges and universities has been comprehensively deepened. The success rate of college students' entrepreneurship reflects the level and quality of IEE to a certain extent and is related to the progress of the popularization of IEE (Hameed et al., 2021 ). Therefore, combining the two hot spots, CCI and college studentsâ entrepreneurship, is one of the trends in social entrepreneurship and employment development. Usually, the authenticity and quality screening of entrepreneurial projects is highly complicated and challenging (Sharma & Kraus et al., 2022 ). Therefore, choosing appropriate cultural and creative projects is imperative to increase the entrepreneurship rate. The recommendation system (RS) is critical for information retrieval and filtering. It can be applied to project decision-making and resource optimization in cultural and creative industries by actively searching and analyzing users' historical behavioral information to achieve accurate recommendations of user preferences. This system performs well in intelligence, accuracy, and personalization (Cunningham et al., 2021 ). With the continuous improvement of science and technology, artificial intelligence (AI) technology is extensively applied in various industries. Neural networks can extract the characteristics of many entrepreneurial projects and resources to achieve automatic optimization of entrepreneurial resources (Nica and Stehel, 2021 ). Moreover, the RS via the neural network algorithm (NNA) can continuously modify the recommendation for entrepreneurial projects based on the user's real-time behavior. Precisely, when the interest drifts of users, it can recommend diverse information for the user (Chalmers et al., 2022 ). When college students start a business, they can choose the appropriate entrepreneurial mechanism and decision-making model according to the RS, significantly improving the entrepreneurial effect. In summary, exploring the optimization of projects and resources in CCI has the theoretical significance of promoting the optimization of economic structure and sustainable development and the practical importance of promoting the increase of entrepreneurship rate of college students. This study innovatively adopts RS for decision-making and resource optimization of CCI-related entrepreneurial projects in response to many different types of entrepreneurial projects. Besides, NNA is employed to model the project characteristics, user's behavior, and content features. Finally, a recommendation and resource optimization model of CCI-related entrepreneurial projects is constructed based on the NNA. This study provides an experimental basis for intelligent and sustainable development of the economy. The structure of this study is as follows. Section 1  describes the research background, motivation, purpose, innovation, and contribution. Section 2  is a literature review, summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of the research of scholars in related fields, highlighting the value of this study. Section 3  constructs a model based on the NNA for recommendation and resource optimization of entrepreneurial projects based on the NNA because there are various types of CCI-related entrepreneurial projects. In addition, the performance of the model is evaluated experimentally. Section 4  compares and analyzes the model constructed here with the models proposed by scholars in related fields. Section 5  briefly describes the experimental results, explains the limitations of this study, and presents the subsequent outlook.  2 Related work 2.1 Optimization and development status of CCI-related entrepreneurial resources Today, the public constantly mentions the slogan of mass entrepreneurship and innovation, and CCI has become the direction of choice for many entrepreneurs. Many scholars have researched resource optimization in entrepreneurship-related fields. Wu and Lin (2021)  combined entropy weight and grey relational analysis to form an evaluation index system considering ambiguity and complexity. The results indicated that cities in the eastern region and island cities have a higher capacity to invest in the utilization of cultural resources than cities in the western region. Meanwhile, the economic benefits of culture are not limited to certain CCIs but extend to the economy as a whole. The regional economy has been effectively revitalized through stimulus policies to build communities. The authors effectively improved the resource generation capacity of the city. Lazzaro and Noonan (2021)  evaluated a range of benefits and barriers to the increasing reliance on crowdfunding of the arts and CCI and proposed a simple financing model for startups. They also critically analyzed and compared the regulatory frameworks in the United States and the European Union. Analysis results indicated that these regulatory frameworks might improve the effectiveness of the creative industries. Finally, the authors put forward some policy recommendations and future research directions. Liu et al. (2021)  gave a detailed analysis and optimization of a modern AI teaching information system based on determining the network architecture and optimizing the overall structure of the network through requirements analysis. Meanwhile, they proposed a multi-class interaction optimization algorithm in combination with the clustering method based on Euclidean distance to enhance the local search capability of the algorithm. It was found that the optimization system has high solution accuracy and excellent stability and performs well in engineering optimization problems, thus verifying the effectiveness of the strategy. Wang et al. (2022)  analyzed the relationship between venture capital, firm performance, and supply chain integration. They also explored the positive impact of supply chain technology optimization innovation and venture capital on the performance improvement of CCI-related enterprises. The results found that optimizing the supply chain structure and production activities could improve the performance of suppliers and venture capital firms.  2.2 Analysis of the application status of Deep Learning in the RS Today, Deep Learning (DL) algorithms are extensively used in all walks of life. They have achieved remarkable results, especially in personalized RSs. Because of the advantages in prediction accuracy, DL has attracted the attention of scholars in related fields. Jin et al. (2020)  proposed a human-in-the-loop parallel learning framework and its application in an end-to-end recommender system that imitates and enhances the behavior of professional signal control engineers. Experimental evaluations showed that the signal RS significantly improved traffic efficiency. Lv et al. (2020)  constructed a cognitive computing model based on context-aware data flow by optimizing the decision tree algorithm in machine learning. They found that applying the model algorithm can ensure the accuracy and stability of behavior classification. It is of great significance for operators to analyze user behavior and develop personalized services. Wen (2021)  designed an intelligent background music system based on DL and the Internet of Things technology and applied it to smart homes. Finally, the experimental results showed that the feature extraction algorithm based on the middle layer feature structure has the highest recognition rate for indoor scenes, about 87.6%. In contrast, the recognition rate of the Gabor feature algorithm for scene classification and recognition is generally about 20%. Gupta et al. (2021)  reviewed and surveyed relevant research in the field of decision support systems and identified gaps and future research opportunities in AI, such as DL, for prediction and learning, decision-making, and optimization. Sharma & Erkut et al. (2020)  analyzed the effectiveness of AI in stock market forecasting by a systematic evaluation. Ultimately, the analysis revealed that AI has extremely significant advantages in stock market prediction and recommendation that can pave the way for future research in the field of finance.  2.3 Status of sustainable economic development With the rapid development of the global economy, a sustainable economy has become the driving force for the continuous development of the era. Sharma et al. (2021d)  used wavelet coherence and the phase difference mechanism to understand the correlation of relevant indicators in the financial domain before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The results found a short-term unidirectional causality from the sustainability index to the conventional index and a bidirectional causality in the medium and long term. This indicates a leading long-term consistency with the sustainability index during COVID-19. Bansal et al. (2022b)  proposed a thematic framework to outline the synergy between circular economy principles and business sustainability from the perspective of business sustainability. At the same time, they effectively measured the practical applicability of the combination of circular economy principles and business strategies and models. Sharma et al. (2021c)  introduced the regulatory effects of renewable energy use and human capital to understand whether they can offset agricultural emissions in this Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation economies. The results showed that human capital is not enough to offset the impact of pesticide use on greenhouse gas emissions. Besides, the interaction between renewable energy and pesticide use suggests that adopting renewable energy in the agricultural sector can reduce the impact of pesticide use on greenhouse gas emissions and support the realization of a few sustainable development goals.  2.4 Summary The above studies suggest that intelligent RS has been broadly used in various fields. However, studies on resource optimization and economic sustainability of CCI combined with smart RSs are relatively rare. Therefore, this study introduces DL algorithm to build an intelligent RS related to entrepreneurial project decision-making and resource optimization to improve the success rate of entrepreneurship. This study can provide a reference value for the practical evaluation of entrepreneurial resource optimization and sustainable economic development.   3 Project recommendation and resource optimization of CCI based on NNA under the trend of economic sustainable development 3.1 Application of the resource optimization and recommendation system for entrepreneurial projects Many investment information platforms have been born with increased entrepreneurial projects in recent years. Although traditional statistical analysis methods can help entrepreneurs understand that CCI is the direction for many entrepreneurs to choose projects, the selection of specific entrepreneurial projects and resource optimization are still clueless. The RS can use prediction algorithms and data mining methods to forecast information or items a user might buy based on a mass of user habits, user features, and item feature data (Li et al., 2020 ; Hong et al., 2019 ). Here, the RS is applied to the selection of entrepreneurial projects. Denote U = { u i  | i = 1,2 , â¦ , n  }     as the set of users, and V = { v j  | j = 1,2 , â¦ , n  }     as the set of items. Besides, a utility function f    is defined to measure the utility, that is, the degree of interest (DoI), of user i  to item j, as shown in Equation (1) .(1) f : U Ã V â R      In Equation (1) , R = R n Ã m      refers to the rating matrix. Each element in the matrix represents the user's DoI in the item. The purpose of the recommendation algorithm is to find the item set that user U  is most interested in in the item set V , which can be expressed as Equation (2) .(2) â u â U , v u  = arg max v â V   f ( u , v  )       Fig. 1   displays the workflow of the RS in the entrepreneurial project. As shown in Fig. 1 , the RS first obtains the user's feedback data, including explicit feedback data and implicit feedback data. Explicit feedback data is provided by users who are interested or not interested in those items, such as movie rating data and âlikesâ and âdislikesâ on social networking sites or news sites. Implicit feedback data is obtained from the user's historical behaviors, indicating which items the user is interested in or not interested in, such as purchase records, adding to a cart, collecting, and browsing on the e-commerce website (Liu et al., 2020 ; Zhang et al., 2020 ). In this research, the user's attention, favorites, comments, browsing, etc., all refer to the user's interest in the item. Second, the recommendation algorithm is selected. Choosing an appropriate recommendation model (such as collaborative filtering recommendation, etc.) for different practical problems is the core of the RS. Finally, the proper entrepreneurial project recommendation results are generated. The recommendation model calculates the user's interest in entrepreneurial projects, sorts all the DoI from high to bottom, takes the top k entrepreneurial projects as the recommendation result, and sends back the recommendation result to the user. Therefore, the RS to select entrepreneurial projects can be continuously optimized through the continuous cycle of the above three steps. In this way, users can acquire accurate and personalized recommendation results for entrepreneurial projects. Fig. 1  also shows that when recommending entrepreneurial user projects, the following information types can usually reflect user interests.(1) User behavior data    Usually, each user has an open user home page, providing enough user data. Analyzing the user's homepage can collect the user's primary characteristic data and user behavior data. The user's behavior data is the most critical information in the personalized RS, reflecting the user's interest. The memory-based recommendation algorithm generates recommendations for the user based on the user's rating data. Thus, user behavior data information requires focused attention and use.(2) Content and characteristic information of entrepreneurial projects    Usually, each entrepreneurial project has a detailed display page. The home page includes various characteristic data of the entrepreneurial scheme, such as the field, label, name, introduction, establishment time, and financing round of the entrepreneurial project. Data can be divided into three categories: structured data, semi-structured data, and unstructured data. The content information of the entrepreneurial project directly affects the user's judgment of the entrepreneurial project and also reflects the user's interest to a certain extent.(3) User information    The user himself fills in information about the user's personal characteristics during the registration process. The user's personal information generally includes the location, area of concern, purpose, and profile. The information presents the user's entrepreneurial interests and preferences to a certain extent. The entrepreneurial project RS is similar to the e-commerce RS, the movie RS, etc. They are constructed by a specific forecasting algorithm and data mining method. Therefore, an appropriate prediction algorithm can optimize the RS's performance.  3.2 Analysis of NNA selection in entrepreneurial RS The recommendation algorithm is the core part of the RS. The recommendation algorithm's quality and its integration with the business directly affect the recommendation accuracy (Song et al., 2021 ). Fig. 2   shows some common algorithms used in recommender systems. The recommendation algorithms in Fig. 2  include content-based recommendation algorithms, memory-based collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms, model-based collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms, hybrid recommendation algorithms, and DL-based recommendation algorithms (Hu et al., 2020 ; Guo et al., 2020 ; Otter et al., 2020 ). First, the content-based recommendation algorithm recommends similar items for the user to the items he liked in the past. In other words, it extracts the user's preference information according to the user's historical behavior. It generates recommendation results for the user according to the similarity between the user's preference and the item. The Vector Space Model is one of the most common content-based recommendation algorithms. Equation (3)  describes a user and an item.(3) D = { w 1  , w 2  , â¦ , w 3   }       In Equation (3) , w i     refers to the weight of the feature. The Term-Frequent-Inverse Document Frequent (TF-IDF) algorithm is the most popular weight calculation method. The TF-IDF algorithm calculates the weight according to Equation (4) .(4) T F â I D F i , j   = T F i , j   Ã I D F i  = n i , j   â k  n k , j     Ã log N d f i         In Equation (4) , n i , j      refers to the frequency of word i  in document j ; N  represents the total number of documents; d f i     denotes the document frequency of the word i , that is, the number of documents in which the word i  appears; T F i , j      signifies the frequency of word i  in document j ; I D F i     stands for to the inverse document frequency of word i . The inverse document frequency measures the popularity of a word. This type of recommendation algorithm can obtain user preference features according to the user's historical record. The more user preference behaviors, the more precise the recommendation result. However, this algorithm does not work for new users without user behavior. Second, the memory-based collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms involve item- and user-based recommendations. The item-based recommendation algorithm calculates the similarity between users. Finding some users closest to the target user is the most critical step of the memory-based collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm. The most commonly used calculation methods include cosine similarity, Pearson correlation coefficient, and Minkowski distance. In the cosine similarity comparison, the smaller the angle between the two vectors, the higher the similarity between user U and user V. The cosine similarity is calculated according to Equation (5) .(5) dis t a n c e ( U , V  )  = U â V  â U â  â V â    = â i m  U i  V i   â i m  ( U i  )  2    â i m  ( V i  )  2           The Pearson correlation coefficient measures the degree of linear correlation between two variables, and its value belongs to [â1, 1]. The greater the correlation coefficient between two users, the higher their similarity. Its calculation method is shown in Equation (6) .(6) Pearson ( U , V  )  = â ( U â U â¾   )  ( V â V â¾   )   â ( U â U â¾   )  2  â ( V â V â¾   )  2          The Minkowski distance is a measure in Euclidean space and can be seen as a generalization of Euclidean distance. The closer the two users are, the more similar they are. Equation (7)  indicates the Minkowski distance.(7) dis t a n c e ( U , V  )  = ( â i = 1  k  | u i  â v i   |  p   )  1 p        p  in Equation (7)  is generally equal to 1 or 2. When p Â =Â 1, Equation (7)  represents the Manhattan distance; when p Â =Â 2, Equation (7)  means the Euclidean distance. When p  approaches infinity, Equation (7)  indicates the Chebyshev distance. Finally, the user-based collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm generates recommendation results. Target users rate all items to be recommended, which can be expressed as Equation (8) .(8) r Ë  u i   = â v â N i  ( u )    s i m ( u , v  )  r v i     â v â N i  ( u )    s i m ( u , v  )          In Equation (8) , ( u , v  )    refers to the degree of similarity between user u  and user v ; N ( u )     refers to the set k  nearest neighbors of the target user u ; N i  ( u )     signifies the set of nearest neighbors among the k  nearest neighbors of user u who have scored item i ; r v i      stands for the true rating of item i . The target user's predicted scores for all recommended items can be calculated according to the above relevant formulas. The scoring data are sorted from large to small, and the previous item are recommended to the target user. The item-based collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm generates the recommendation result in a different way from the user-based collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm. The predicted rating r Ë  u i      of user u  for an item is the weighted average result of the items rated by the user, as presented in Equation (9) .(9) r Ë  u i   = â j â N u  ( i )    s i m ( i , j  )  r u i     â j â N u  ( i )    s i m ( i , j  )          In Equation (9) , N u  ( i )     refers to the set of items scored by user u , and sim  (i , j ) represents the similarity between item i  and item j.  Although this type of recommendation algorithm can improve the novelty of the recommendation results to a certain extent, it is not frequently used due to its poor scalability, dependence on user ratings, and data sparsity. Third, the model-based collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm mainly includes recommendation algorithms such as Bayesian network, Markov decision, and latent semantic technology. However, the training via such algorithms is time-consuming, and the dimensionality reduction method may ignore useful feature information. Fourth, hybrid recommendation algorithms mainly include weighted hybrids, switching hybrids, hierarchical hybrids, and partitioned hybrids. Fig. 3   illustrates the structure of the hybrid recommendation algorithm. As shown in Fig. 3 , user behavior data, user feature data, and item feature data are collected. Then, four combined recommendation algorithms are used for feature extraction to generate the recommendation result: weighted mixing, switching mixing, partition mixing, and hierarchical mixing. However, this recommendation algorithm has some shortcomings. Its complexity and implementation difficulty increase significantly. Fifth, DL has been widely used in RSs for a long time, realizing many excellent algorithms. The general design idea of the DL-based recommendation algorithm is to convert discrete high-dimensional features into fixed-length continuous components through feature embedding operations. Then, it performs feature extraction through multiple full connections and finally activates through corresponding activation functions (AFs) to obtain the corresponding predicted recommendation probability. Fig. 4   presents the common framework of the DL-based recommendation algorithm. The framework of the DL-based RS in Fig. 4  includes three parts: the input, model, and output layers. The input and the output layers are the same as the conventional recommendation algorithm, and the main difference is the recommendation model. That is, the powerful feature extraction capability of DL is used at the model layer to extract sufficient meaningful feature representations from low-level features to increase the accuracy of the recommendation results. For example, the Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) is used as the recommendation algorithm. Equation (10)  indicates the number of hidden layers in a general three-layer neural network.(10) h = 1 2  ( Y + O  )  + a , a = 1,2 , â¯ , 10     In Equation (10) , Y    stands for the number of neurons; O    refers to the number of neurons in the output layer; a    is a constant. The number is h = 8 + a    according to the empirical formula. The transit function is used as the AF Ï ( x )     of the hidden layer, which is a necessary component to regulate the activity of neurons. Moreover, the weights and thresholds are defined. The connection weight of the second layer neuron i  to the first layer neuron j  is w i j     ; the threshold value of the second layer neuron is Î¸ i    ; the connection weight between the third layer neuron k  and the second layer neuron i  is w k i     ; the threshold of the third layer neurons is a k    . Then, the model objects can be expressed as Equation (11) .(11) E = 1 2  â p = 1  P  â k = 1  L  ( T k p  â O k p   )  2         The trained BPNN can approximate the ideal output value through the new input; that is, the error between the actual output and the ideal output is the smallest. The optimized back propagation LevenbergâMarquardt (BP-LM) network is adopted for operation. Next, the collected data is passed through forward propagation and backpropagation. Forward propagation fits the data from input to output in the network. However, since only the trained network can work, network training is done through backpropagation. The error between the output of the model and the expected output is fed back to the weight and threshold of each neuron to adaptively adjust the weight and threshold. With the adaptive adjustment of value and threshold, the trained neural network can efficiently fit the data (Hossain and Muhammad, 2020 ). In the data analysis process, each neuron in the input layer acts on each neuron in the hidden layer. Equation (12)  describes the input Y S R i     of the neuron in the hidden layer.(12) Y S R i  = â j = 1  13  w i j   Y j  + Î¸ i         The output Y S C i     is calculated according to Equation (13) .(13) Y S C i  = Ï ( Y S R i   )  = Ï ( â j = 1  13  w i j   Y j  + Î¸ i    )       Equation (14)  indicates the input S C S R k     of the kth  node of the output layer.(14) S C S R k  = â i = 1  13  w k i   Y S C i  + a k    = â i = 1  13  w k i   Ï ( â j = 1  13  w i j   Y j  + Î¸ i    )  + a k         The output o k     of the output layer can be written as Equation (15) .(15) o k  = Ï ( S C S R k   )  = Ï ( â i = 1  13  w k i   Y S C i  + a k    )   = Ï ( â i = 1  13  w k i   Ï ( â j = 1  13  w i j   Y j  + Î¸ i    )  + a k    )        After analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of the above various recommendation algorithms, the DL-based RS is selected for the recommendation of entrepreneurial projects. Assuming that there are M  items and N  users, there is the scoring matrix R = R N Ã M     . Matrix decomposition aims to solve the IF (IF) moments users U  and V  of users and items using the scoring matrix R . U = R k Ã N      and V = R k Ã M     . In turn, the unknown score in the score matrix R  can be calculated through U T  V   . First, the probabilistic matrix factorization algorithm supposes that the implicit eigenvectors of items and users obey a Gaussian distribution, as shown in Equations (16) and (17) .(16) P ( U | Ï U 2   )  = â i = 1  N  N ( u i  | O , Ï U 2  I  )        (17) P ( V | Ï U 2   )  = â i = 1  N  N ( v i  | O , Ï V 2  I  )         In Equations (16) and (17) , N ( x | Î¼ , Ï 2   )     refers to the probability density function of the Gaussian distribution; Î¼    denotes the mean; Ï 2     stands for the variance; V  and U  denote the IF matrix of items and users; v i     and u i     signify the IF vectors of items and users; I    refers to the identity matrix. Assume that the conditional probability of the observed rating data also obeys the Gaussian prior distribution, as shown in Equation (18) .(18) P ( R | U , V , Ï R 2   )  = â i = 1  n  â j = 1  m  [ N ( R i , j   | U i T  , V j  , Ï R 2   )   ]    I i , j  R        In Equation (18) , I i , j  R     indicates the indicator function. It is 1 when user i  has rated item j , and 0 otherwise. Equation (19)  indicates the posterior probability of the IFs of users and items based on the Bayesian formula.(19) P ( U , V | R , Ï R 2  , Ï U 2  , Ï V 2   )   â P ( R | U , V , Ï R 2   )  P ( U | Ï U 2   )  P ( V | Ï V 2   )       When the RS is applied to an entrepreneurial project, the IF V  of the project is calculated by the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. Assume that W  refers to the parameter set of the DNN and obeys the Gaussian distribution, and X j     refers to the feature input of the jth  project. Then, the jth  item V j     can be expressed as Equation (20) .(20) V j  = d n n ( W , X j   )  + Îµ j       In Equation (20) , d n n ( â )     refers to the DNN; Îµ j     represents the random error and obeys the Gaussian distribution. Equation (21)  describes the random error.(21) Îµ j  â¼ N ( 0 , Ï V 2  I  )       Suppose that the parameter set W  also satisfies the Gaussian distribution. Then, the probability distribution of W  can be written as Equation (22) .(22) P ( W | Ï W 2   )  = â k = 1  p  N ( W k  | 0 , Ï W 2   )         Equation (23)  describes the conditional probability distribution of the item's latent feature V .(23) P ( V | W , X , Ï V 2   )  = â j = 1  m  N ( V j  | d n n ( W , X j   )  , Ï V 2  I  )         The algorithm aims to solve the IF matrix V  of the project, the IF U  of the user, and the parameter set W  of the DNN. The Bayesian formula is used to obtain its probability distribution, such as Equation (24) .(24) P ( U , V , W | R , X , Ï 2  , Ï U 2  , Ï V 2  , Ï W 2   )   = P ( R | U , V , Ï 2   )  P ( U | Ï U 2   )  P ( V | W , X , Ï V 2   )  P ( W | Ï W 2   )        In this way, the relationship between the probability matrix decomposition algorithm and the DNN algorithm is established.  3.3 Recommendation and resource optimization model of CCI-related entrepreneurial projects based on NNA The probability matrix factorization algorithm and DNN constructed above can improve the recommendation accuracy of entrepreneurial projects. There are still problems with the rating matrix's sparsity and users' cold start. Integrating user characteristics into the RS and reducing the impact of the sparsity of the rating matrix on the recommendation results is essential. The above algorithm is further extended. A DNN replaces the matrix factorization algorithm to model user behavior and content characteristics. The user's feature information is also integrated into the RS to resolve the user's cold start problem and improve the accuracy of the RS. Fig. 5   reveals the recommendation and resource optimization model of CCI-related entrepreneurial projects based on NNA. The network in Fig. 5  contains two neural network structures: the user network model on the left and the item network model on the right. The network structure of the item's latent feature extraction uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to process unstructured text information and uses word embedding and one-hot encoding to process other features. The user model mainly includes two parts: the user's historical behavior feature modeling and the user's content feature modeling. The Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) algorithm is used to process the user's historical behavior information as the network's input. The content features are processed in a similar way. Specifically, CNN is used to process text features, and word embedding and one-hot encoding are used for other features. Therefore, the processing procedures of the model include feature processing and splicing, layer-by-layer abstraction, and scoring output in the fully connected layer. First, user features and item features are processed separately. After each feature is processed, user features and item features are spliced respectively to generate high-dimensional space vector representations of users and items. Second, the fully connected layer abstracts the high-dimensional space vectors representing users and items layer by layer. Then, several fully connected layers extract features from users and items layer by layer and finally output the hidden features of the item and the user, which are in the same vector space. Third, using the idea of matrix decomposition to calculate the inner product of the IFs of users and items output by the two networks can obtain the output of the network, that is, the user score. It is necessary to reduce the dimension of the user's rating data before inputting it into the neural network to further reduce the impact of data sparsity on the model. The user's rating vector is dimensionally reduced by using the RBM algorithm. The visible layer reflects the user's rating data, and the hidden layer is used to represent the dimensionality-reduced data. Taking the dimensionality-reduced rating data as the input of the DNN to reconstruct the user's network structure. Of course, the input of the user network includes other feature information of the user, such as the region, profile, areas of concern, and purpose. Finally, the model is trained and generates the recommendation result. Fig. 6   provides the specific process. As shown in Fig. 6 , model training is divided into unsupervised pre-training and supervised training. Pre-training mainly reduces the impact of data sparsity on model training by training the RBM network. Meanwhile, relatively dense features are extracted from the sparse scoring data. In the supervised training stage, the user rating features obtained by pre-training are combined with other content features of the user as the input of the user network. The item's text and other features are used as the input of the item network. Then, the neural network maps user and item features into the same high-dimensional space. The calculation of each layer of the network can be expressed as Equation (25) .(25) X h  = Ï ( W i  x + b i   )       In Equation (25) , X h     refers to the activation value of the h th layer; W i     represents the parameter set; b i     denotes the bias; Ï ( â )     denotes the AF. The Relu function is used as the AF, which can be written as Equation (26) .(26) Ï ( x )  = { x ,   i f   x > 0    0 ,   i f   x â¤ 0           The IF vector u i     of the user and the IF vector v i     of the item are obtained through the above procedures. The predicted score can be calculated by Equation (27) .(27) r Ë  i j   = u i  T  v j       Equation (28)  indicates the objective function used in supervised model training.(28) l o s s ( W u  , W v   )  = â i n  â j m  I i j   â r i j   â u i  T  v j   â  2          u i     and v j     in Equation (28)  are expressed as Equations (29) and (30) .(29) u i  = d n n u  ( r i  , x i  , W u   )      (30) v j  = d n n v  ( y j  , W v   )       In Equations (29) and (30) , r i j      refers to user i 's true rating of item j ; r i     represents user i 's rating vector; x i     denotes user's feature input; y j     signifies item's content feature input; W u     and W v     represent the neural network used to extract user features and the network used to extract item features, respectively; d n n u  ( r i  , x i  , W u   )     and d n n v  ( y j  , W v   )     refer to the user network and the item network, respectively. This study uses a gradient descent algorithm to solve the parameter sets W u     and W v     to calculate any user's rating for any item. The calculated scores are arranged from large to small, and the top k  items are taken as the final recommendation results.  3.4 Analysis of the experimental evaluation An experiment is conducted to evaluate the performance of the CCI-related entrepreneurial project recommendation and resource optimization model based on NNA reported here. It is found that there are no publicly available datasets on the Internet that can be used for the entrepreneurial project RS by browsing and comparing relevant datasets on the Internet. Therefore, this study uses web crawlers to collect information from the entrepreneurial project information platform. The processing methods for different information are as follows. First, missing data is processed. The data of startup projects with too few users, missing data, or too many users were deleted. There are 7759 entrepreneurial projects and 7763 users in total. A total of 248,517 user rating data are obtained through the processing method of implicit feedback data, and the sparsity of the data is 99.59%. Second, entrepreneurial project data is processed. The entrepreneurial project characteristics include the project number, name, field, financing round, project label, and status. Only a few entrepreneurial projects have missing values, and these entrepreneurial projects with missing values are directly deleted. All other entrepreneurial projects are reserved. Third, user data is processed. The user characteristics include the user's region, profile, areas of concern, and purpose. The processing methods of these data are as follows. The regional data, such as Beijing and Shanghai, are processed by one-hot encoding. Then, user profiles, such as serial entrepreneurs from 2010 to 2016, are unstructured text data. The same processing method is adopted as the description text data of the project. In other words, the text CNN is used to process the user's profile after word segmentation. Third, users can focus on multiple fields, such as finance, the Internet, and education, up to a maximum of 21. Since the total number of fields is small, it can be processed by one-hot encoding, and each user's concerned field is encoded as a 21-dimensional vector. Fourth, the user's purpose involves understanding new companies and new products and looking for investment objects. There are a total of 9 users' purposes. Each user may have multiple purposes. One-hot encoding is used for processing, and each user's goal is encoded as a 9-dimensional vector. Fifth, scoring data is processed. The scoring data is calculated and obtained from the user's historical behavior data and processed by the implicit feedback data processing method (Li et al., 2022 ). Each row of the processed score data represents a user's score data. The score data includes three columns: the user ID, the entrepreneurial project ID, and the score. The hyperparameters are set as follows for the CNN framework to achieve the desired prediction results. The number of training epochs is 65; the learning rate is 0.002; the batch size is 128; the convolution kernel size is 1*3; the AF is ReLU; the Dropout Rate size in the CNN framework is 0.5; the optimizer is Adam. Comparative analysis is conducted on the representative advanced CNNs, including AlexNet (Jamshidi et al., 2020 ), DenseNet (Kalinov et al., 2020 ), VGGNet (Zhou et al., 2020 ), IGCNet (Javed et al., 2021 ), the model proposed by Liang et al. (2021) , and the model reported here. Algorithm performance is analyzed from Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 value, and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The experimental environment is as follows. The operating system is Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit; the Central Processing Unit is Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E 5 -2682 v4@ 2. 50Â GHz; memory is 16G; hard disk is 500G SSD; development language is Python; the DL framework is Keras (backend uses TensorFlow).   4 Results and discussion 4.1 Analysis of recognition accuracy of entrepreneurial project recommendations under different algorithms The model constructed here is compared with advanced CNNs and the proposed model by Liang et al. (2021) . Figs. 7 and 8   provide the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 values with the training period and the increase of items. As shown in Fig. 7 , the recognition Accuracy of the model reported here reaches 81.64%, at least 2.60% higher than the model proposed by other scholars. The precision, recall, and F1 values of the model reported here are 75.89%, 72.82%, and 79.22%, respectively, significantly higher than other models. It can be seen that the entrepreneurial projects based on the NNA-based entrepreneurial project recommendation and resource optimization model have an excellent recommendation and prediction effect. Fig. 8   compares the model reported here and other algorithms from the perspectives of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 value to recommend the entrepreneurial projects with the change of entrepreneurial projects. With the increase in entrepreneurial projects, the recommendation accuracy of each algorithm for entrepreneurial projects shows a rising trend. When the number of entrepreneurial projects is 300, the recognition Accuracy of the model reported here attains 81.75%, at least 3.65% higher than the models proposed by other scholars. In addition, the Accuracy, Recall, and F1 value of the model reported here is 78.05%, 74.61%, and 80.49%, respectively, significantly higher than other algorithms. The results indicate that the recommendation and resource optimization model of CCI-related entrepreneurial projects based on NNA has better entrepreneurial project recommendation prediction performance than similar algorithms.  4.2 Analysis of recommendation prediction errors of each algorithm The model constructed here is compared with several models under different numbers of hidden features and different lengths of word vector (WV) as the training period and the number of items changes. Figs. 9 and 10   provide specific results. It can be seen from Fig. 9  that the RMSE value shows a trend of first decreasing and then increasing with the increase of IFs. When the number of IFs is 200, the recommendation prediction error of each algorithm is the smallest. Among different algorithms, the error of the algorithm reported here is smaller than the other algorithms. When the length of the WV is 100 and 300, respectively, the recommended prediction error of the model constructed here is 4.08% and 6.01% when the number of IFs is 200. These are significantly lower than other models. From this, the optimal number of IFs is 200. At this time, the NNA-based CCI-related entrepreneurial project recommendation and resource optimization model has a low prediction error. Fig. 10   demonstrates the RMSE value first decreases and then increases with the increase of the length of the WV. When the length of the WV is 200, the recommendation prediction error of each algorithm is the smallest. Further comparison of different algorithms shows that the error of the algorithm reported here is smaller than the others. When the number of IFs is 50 and 250, respectively, the recommended prediction error of the model constructed here is 4.49% and 6.23% when the WV length is 200. The values are significantly lower than other algorithms. It can be concluded that the optimal WV length is 200. At this time, the CCI-related entrepreneurial project recommendation and resource optimization model based on the NNA achieves low prediction errors.   5 Discussion This study explores the significance of CCI projects and resource optimization for sustainable economic development. A recommendation and resource optimization model based on NNA is built for CCI-related entrepreneurial projects, aiming at the current situation of numerous and complex entrepreneurial projects in CCI. The model evaluation suggests that the prediction accuracy of the NNA-based resource optimization model is more than 80%. When the number of entrepreneurial projects is 300, the identification accuracy of the model for project resource optimization reported here reaches 81.75%. At the same time, the prediction error of the resource optimization and recommendation system is the minimum when the length of the word vector is 200, and the number of hidden features is 200. This research result is consistent with Kerzel (2021)  âs research. Kerzel (2021)  found that AI and machine learning have great potential to change enterprises and overturn the entire industry. When applying AI technologies such as DL to the enterprise RS, it can automatically support or execute decisions and integrate AI-based systems into their human resources. Thus, the resource optimization model of CCI-related entrepreneurship projects reported here can provide an experimental reference for economically intelligent and sustainable development.  6 Conclusion In the Internet era, CCI-related projects have attracted much attention, and the number of entrepreneurial projects continues to grow. Since there are diverse types of CCI-related entrepreneurial projects, this study innovatively applies RS to the decision-making of entrepreneurial projects. Besides, NNA is used to build a recommendation and resource optimization model for CCI-related entrepreneurial projects based on NNA to analyze and evaluate the project characteristics, user behavior characteristics, and content characteristics. The following achievements have been obtained through experimental evaluation. First, the prediction accuracy of the model reported here reaches more than 80%. Second, the RS has the smallest prediction error when the word vector length is 200, and the number of implicit features is 200. Third, when the number of entrepreneurial projects is 300, the recognition accuracy of the model for project resource optimization reaches 81.75%. These findings can contribute to the sustainable development of the social economy and the optimization of entrepreneurial resources. Still, this study has some shortcomings. First, the algorithm experiment is extended to the distributed platform. Because the data set of the entrepreneurial platform information used here is relatively small, relevant experiments can be completed on a single machine. However, when the amount of data continues to increase, the single-machine operation may lead to the problem of slow operation. It is essential to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the running speed of the model in the future. Moreover, this study only recommends and makes decisions on entrepreneurial projects in the information of the entrepreneurial project platform. Follow-up research should pay attention to cross-domain recommendation issues, such as news data and other information in the entrepreneurial project platform. The cross-domain information also reflects usersâ interests to a certain extent. Therefore, how to add cross-domain information to the recommendation algorithm will be an essential research direction for the improvement of the subsequent RS.
