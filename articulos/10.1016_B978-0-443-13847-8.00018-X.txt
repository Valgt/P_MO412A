               Solid waste has become an essential problem due to cities’ rising populace and development. Solid waste management (SWM) can be a complicated process in developing nations such as Türkiye due to the difficulty of collection, storage, and disposal of high amounts of solid waste. To overcome this challenge, SWM is critical. Türkiye has established high standards to handle solid waste effectively and achieve sustainable development. Türkiye strives to promote sustainability through SWM at the local level, with initiatives focused on improving infrastructure, waste reduction and segregation, and awareness-raising campaigns. Achieving these goals will require continued investment and innovation, but Türkiye is progressing toward a more sustainable future through effective SWM. This chapter aims to evaluate the situation of SWM with a sustainability approach in Türkiye. The current status and waste-to-energy options are discussed. Future perspectives and challenges of SWM based on a sustainability approach are determined.

Solid waste management (SWM) can be a complicated process in developing nations such as Türkiye due to the difficulty of collection, storage, and disposal of high amounts of solid waste. To overcome this challenge, SWM is critical. Türkiye has established high standards to handle solid waste effectively and achieve sustainable development. Türkiye strives to promote sustainability through SWM at the local level, with initiatives focused on improving infrastructure, waste reduction and segregation, and awareness-raising campaigns. Achieving these goals will require continued investment and innovation, but Türkiye is progressing toward a more sustainable future through effective SWM. This chapter aims to evaluate the situation of SWM with a sustainability approach in Türkiye. The current status and waste-to-energy options are discussed. Future perspectives and challenges of SWM based on a sustainability approach are determined.   Keywords Waste management  Türkiye  solid waste  sustainable development goals  waste to energy   18.1 Introduction  Solid waste is a critical problem in the world, especially in developing countries such as Türkiye. The US Environmental Protection Agency defines solid waste as any trash or refuses produced slurry in sewage sludge and water supply treatment buildings, air pollution control capabilities, and other waste material resulting from community activities, agronomic and mining activities, and other industrial facilities. Solid waste can be classified as municipal, agricultural, and industrial. Annual global municipal solid waste (MSW) production is reported as approximately 1.3 billion tons, predicted to reach 2.2 in 2025 (Abdollahi Saadatlu et al., 2022 ) and 3.4 billion tons in 2050 (Peng et al., 2023 ). Management of MSW is complex and expensive due to its high amount. Landfilling, composting, and incineration are the main disposal methods. Improper managing of solid waste causes critical environmental risks. It is reported that during landfilling, approximately 5% of greenhouse gas emissions are from solid waste (Guo et al., 2021 ). On the other hand, this situation can be turned into an opportunity with waste to energy (WtE), the sustainable energy sources from municipal solid waste (Tozlu et al., 2016 ). WtE applications are commonly employed in developing countries but are limited to developing countries (Khan et al., 2022 ). Thermal conversion, biochemical conversion, and landfilling are the WtE technologies (Tozlu et al., 2016 ). In Türkiye, landfilling is the primary used MSW management method (Melikoglu, 2013 ). Global energy demand has dramatically increased due to increasing population and industrialization, and it is estimated that it will increase to 48% and reach 778 Etta Joule in 2035 (Özel et al., 2022 ). On the other hand, 80% of this energy demand is currently provided by fossil fuels (Nicoletti et al., 2015 ). It is well known that fossil fuels cause critical environmental problems such as global warming. In addition, renewable energy  sources have gained importance in the last two decades (Ouda et al., 2016 ). Wind, solar, and waste are used as renewable energy sources. Waste plays a vital role among these energy sources. International Energy Agency (IEA) indicated that the calorific value of per ton MSW is 8–12 MJ/kg for energy generation (Melikoglu, 2013 ). The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were accepted by the United Nations in 2015 as universal periods of action to protect the globe, end impoverished conditions, and ensure that all human beings live in harmony and prosperity by 2030. For these reasons, 17 SDG goals were determined, and goals 7 and 11 are related to access to sustainable, reliable, affordable energy and sustainable cities, respectively. It is possible to achieve these goals with WtE applications (AlQattan et al., 2018 ). In the 2022 Sustainable Development Report, Türkiye ranks 71st among 163 countries with a score of 70.4 (Sachs et al., 2022 ). According to the report, Türkiye’s 17 goals are more toward the realization need to take steps. The study aims to determine the situation of solid waste management with a sustainability approach in Türkiye. The current status and waste to energy options are discussed. Future perspectives and challenges of MSW management are determined.  18.2 Methods This chapter outlines the existing solid waste management exercises in Türkiye and the methods used to attain sustainable development goals rather than reporting on a specific experiment or research project. This chapter’s material is based on an analysis of the existing literature, which includes academic studies, official reports, and news items. To comprehend the nation’s legal foundation for waste management, we also reviewed Türkiye’s Solid Waste Master Plan and Environmental Law No. 2872.  18.3 Foundational—introductory 18.3.1 Waste generation in the world and Türkiye Waste production is a by-product of population increase, economic development, and urbanization. Cities and countries must deal with equivalent amounts of trash to be treated and disposed of as they become more populous, prosperous, and engaged in international trade and exchange. National solid waste production rates vary significantly from 0.11 to 4.54 kilograms per capita per day, while this rate is 0.74 kilograms per person per day globally. Income and urbanization rates are generally connected with waste generation quantities (Kaza et al., 2018 ). Waste generation has significantly increased in recent decades, especially in industrial nations such as OECD countries, generating half of the global waste production (AlQattan et al., 2018 ). East Asia and the Pacific account for 23% of all trash produced, with Europe and Central Asia coming in second with 20%. North Africa and the  Middle East account for 6% of the global total, and sub-Saharan Africa, with 9%, has the lowest generation rates. With 17%, 14%, and 11%, respectively, South Asia, North America, and Latin America and the Caribbean are the three regions in between (Ferraz de Campos et al., 2021 ). Fig. 18.1   Türkiye’s municipal waste amounts distribution is given. According to this figure, there is an increase in the amount of solid waste produced with the increase in population density. When the distribution of waste types is examined, the ratio of organic wastes in Türkiye is 45%, while the ratio of other wastes is 55%. The amount of solid waste produced per person is 1.13 kg/day for 2020 (Turkish Statistical Institute, 2023 ). In 2016 1.6 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) corresponding greenhouse gas emissions were expected to be released from solid waste action and disposal processes, mainly from open dumping and landfills deprived of gas capture systems constructed on the amount of waste produced its composition and management practices. This accounts for around 5% of global emissions. Solid waste−related releases are likely to reach 2.6 billion tonnes of CO2  equivalent per year by 2050 if the industry does not see any advances (Kaza et al., 2018 ). In addition, buildings generate waste throughout their lifespan, particularly throughout the construction, renovation, and demolition phases. These building wastes in many nations, including Türkiye, cause major environmental problems. Türkiye has no net statistics on the number of construction wastes. During its use, interior changes are  frequently made for various reasons, primarily for Turkish homes, resulting in construction waste. The prevention and reduction of construction waste creation should be the leading environmental goal in this area (Esin & Cosgun, 2007 ).  18.3.2 The characteristics of solid waste The organization of solid waste is a global problem that impacts everyone. Individual and government waste management decisions affect communities’ daily health, output, and cleanliness. Poor waste management methods pollute the world’s oceans, clog drain, cause flooding, breed illness-carrying factors, surge breathing difficulties because of airborne elements from burning discarded, harm mammals that unintentionally eat waste, and deter commercial growth through lessened tourism, among other things. To remove the uncontrolled and poorly managed waste from decades of economic expansion, action must be taken quickly at all societal levels (Kaza et al., 2018 ). All waste we generate from daily activities, for example, packages, bottles, leftovers, newspapers, types of equipment, and batteries, are considered solid wastes. If these materials are not removed, they may seriously harm the environment and the inhabitants, especially if they end up in any spring, sewage system, or rubbish collection and storage zone. For this reason, it is imperative to transport solid wastes after collecting them under the necessary technical and medical circumstances. Municipal solid wastes, special wastes, and industrial (hazardous) wastes are the three categories into which solid wastes are divided. In contrast to special wastes, which include poisonous, radioactive, and medical wastes, municipal solid waste typically states to nonhazardous wastes. Industrial wastes, the third category, may come from municipal sources (Arıkan et al., 2017 ). Solid wastes are a variety of organic or inorganic nonliquid wastes produced in society but have no utility after being produced. A natural by-product of human existence is solid garbage, because home, commercial, and industrial activities all result in garbage production. However, socioeconomic changes such as those seen in the last 30 years, including urbanization, commerce, population growth, and economic growth, have boosted solid waste output more than before. According to the World Bank estimation, 2.01 billion tons of MSW would be produced in 2022 (Kocak & Baglitas, 2022 ). For MSW management, identifying the type of trash is crucial. Trash is often divided into hazardous and nonhazardous categories. Hazardous waste can be distinguished from nonhazardous waste by the presence of the hazardous characteristic. Hazardous waste’s properties include corrosivity, infectiousness, toxicity, reactivity, and ignitability. The primary components of nonhazardous trash include paper, organic materials, plastics, wood, glass, and metals (Mamashli & Javadian, 2021 ). In developing nations, urbanization is rising quickly. The management of home solid trash is in a precarious position due to the trend toward urbanization, population expansion, and growing concern over the adverse effects on the environment.  Accordingly, poor waste management and inadequate strategies may result in the deterioration of priceless land resources, an increase in the price of land, and the development of long-term health and environmental issues. Therefore a sustainable solid waste collection model that considers public health principles, governmental regulations, and other environmental implications is crucial (Hannan et al., 2020 ). A solid waste characteristic is vital for the management of MSW. It is affected by various elements, including socioeconomic profile, climatic circumstances in a region, recycling extent, collection frequency, and population (Kumar & Samadder, 2017 ). Depending on the development level of the countries, paper waste has the highest share in waste composition in highly developed countries. In contrast, organic waste has the highest share in underdeveloped and developing countries (Kumar & Samadder, 2017 ). Similarly, organic waste has the highest percentage among solid wastes in Türkiye, a developing country. When the composition of the solid wastes produced is examined in Türkiye, kitchen waste was found to have the most significant rate at 34%, other noncombustible materials at 22%, other combustible materials at 19%, paper at 11%, glass at 6%, cardboard at 5%, plastic at 2%, and metal at 1% (Bilgili & Çetinkaya, 2023 ). The Turkish waste characteristics trend showed a modest increase in paper/cardboard waste percentage and an insignificant decrease in food waste. The other composition of MSW was approximately constant (Yılmaz & Abdulvahitoğlu, 2019 ).   18.4 Empirical literatures 18.4.1 Solid waste management practice in Türkiye Waste management operations are costly and complex, with competing objectives, for instance, clean water, education, and healthcare. Local governments usually undertake waste management but have limited resources and expertise to design, run contracts, and organize operations. Owing to these features, low- and middle-income countries and their metropolises have been confronted with focusing on maintainable waste management while pursuing economic growth. Poor waste management has devastating effects that disproportionately affect low-income people, who are frequently uninvolved in or have little control over the formal or informal garbage disposal processes close to their homes (Kaza et al., 2018 ). SWM system includes numerous stages such as monitoring, gathering, storing, transferring, manipulating, and disposing of waste while considering population production and consumption patterns concerning population and environmental health, the economy, engineering, protection, and esthetics. Adequate solid waste management requires interdisciplinary connections between politics, regional and municipal engineering, materials science, planning, geography, economics, public health, and sociology, among other fields (Arıkan et al., 2017 ).  Solid waste management is widely known to be vital in several ecological issues, including stratospheric ozone exhaustion, climate change, human health damage, and environmental detriment. The alarming rise in solid waste generation necessitates management strategies that fully address these environmental issues and ultimately help society transition to a more environmentally friendly way of life (Laurent et al., 2014 ). Generally, SWM operations are primarily the responsibility of local governments, and almost 70% of countries have associations to handle trash policy development and regulatory oversight. Though enforcement varies widely, approximately two-thirds of nations have enacted solid waste legislation and standards. About 70% of waste facilities are straightforwardly regulated by local governments, with the central government frequently just engaging in regulatory oversight or monetary transfers. At least 50% of services—from primary rubbish collection to treatment and disposal—are delivered by municipal organizations, with a third coming from public−private partnerships (Kaza et al., 2018 ). A further effort was made to analyze the cost information of SWM procedures because solid waste management is one of the primary municipal expenses. In addition to demographic data, how cost and solid waste terms are defined affects how the characteristics and costs for managing solid waste vary depending on the municipal application. Because of this, the writers have tried to combine some of the data from solid waste that illustrates demographic and sociological information about Türkiye(Metin et al., 2003 ). The rising amount of waste produced, the strain on municipal budgets brought on by high management costs, the lack of knowledge regarding several factors that affect the numerous phases of SWM, and the connections necessary to do the whole management system work are the primary causes managing solid waste, which is a challenge for authorities in developing countries (Guerrero et al., 2013 ). Municipal concrete waste issues are challenging, but Türkiye continues improving garbage collection, transportation, and disposal efficiency. Even though there are rigorous restrictions on the management of solid waste, Türkiye has seen ancient disposal techniques, including open dumping and discharge into surface waters (Turan et al., 2009 ). Previously, dumping solid waste at open sites was the leading solid waste disposal route in Türkiye. In 1993 there was an accident in Umraniye–Hekimbası open dumpsite due to the explosion of methane gases compressed within the dumping area, and 39 people died there. After this catastrophe, solid waste management has gained importance, and instead of open dumping sites, controlled landfill sites are used for solid waste disposal (Turan et al., 2009 ). More than 83% of the population has MSW services in Türkiye (Tozlu et al., 2016 ). The main MSW is controlled landfill sites in Türkiye Fig. 18.2  . Residential, commercial, and institutional trash are all included in MSW; however, hazardous, industrial, and construction garbage are not. The three sustainability supports—economic, environmental, and social—must be considered for MSW management systems to be sustainable. New technology and facilities may need to be added  to the MSW systems to consider sustainability. Due to a lack of land in metropolitan centers and growing public concern about potential human health dangers from these facilities, remote conventional treatment plants and sanitary landfills have evolved in MSWM systems in recent years. The typical MSWM system structure has developed due to the development of longer transit routes between already-existing and newly introduced facilities (Mohsenizadeh et al., 2020 ). The waste management strategies of countries depend on income level, such as in high-income metropolitan regions generating high trash amounts. On the other hand, collecting waste and finding land for treatment and disposal become more challenging for these cities due to urbanization and population growth (Kaza et al., 2018 ). The cost of managing solid waste is high. Waste management generally consumes up to 20% of municipal budgets, especially in low-income countries, and is frequently the most costly budget item for many local governments. Solid waste management takes up roughly 4% of high-income countries and more than 10% of middle-income countries (Kaza et al., 2018 ). Significant initiatives toward sustainable solid waste management in Türkiye are outlined in detail. Due to the mandatory deposit on beverage packaging under the most recent environmental regulations, recycling rates are anticipated to rise. Additionally, details were  provided on Istanbul, the city in Türkiye that generates the most garbage, its evolving structure, and what it is doing and plans to do in the present following legal targets. With the new investments in Istanbul, there will be a rise in the amount of materials recovered and energy produced, as well as a drop in the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from waste disposal due to a significant decrease in landfill use (Hoşoğlu, 2022 ).  18.4.2 Energy sources and the current situation The total power installed in Türkiye increased from 78,497 to 95,890 MW from 2016 to 2020. Turkish Statistical Institutes database indicated that in 2016, 8.6% of the produced energy was from waste and renewable energy sources (Fig. 18.3  ). In addition, in 2020 this rate increased significantly and reached 16.8% (Turkish Statistical Institute, 2023 ). In the first quarter of 2023, the installed power of Türkiye reached 104,348 MW (Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, 2023 ). Although coal and natural gas share in total energy production decreases daily, they still constitute the highest share. According to reports, the capacity that resources had installed as of the end of March 2023 included 2.5% other sources, 30.3% hydraulic energy, 24.3% natural gas, 20.9% coal, 11% wind, 9.4% solar, and 1.6% geothermal energy (Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, 2023 ). In recent years, there has been an increase in renewable energy sources and waste-to-energy production. According to the 2023 visions of Türkiye, it was planned to 30% of the demand for electricity to meet from renewable energy sources in the current situation (first quarter of 2023), and this aim was succeeded.  The “Law on the Use of Renewable Energy Resources for Electric Power Generation” specifies renewable energy resources. The methods and principles governing the preservation of renewable energy resource regions, the certification of electrical energy derived from these resources, and their usage are discussed. This law aims to increase electricity production from renewable energy resources, contribute to the economy by using these resources appropriately, and increase the diversity of resources in electricity production. In addition, it aims to reduce the use of fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions with renewable energy sources, which are expected to replace them day by day and to protect the environment and electricity production by converting resources found in nature in case of waste. With the law in question, sources of nonfossil energy, including hydropower, wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, and gas produced from biomass (including landfill gas), wave, current energy, and tides, are defined as renewable energy sources (The Law on the Use of Renewable Energy Resources for the Purpose of Electricity Generation, 2005 ). Türkiye Renewable Energy Resources Support Mechanism (YEKDEM) supports renewable energy plant. The feed-in tariff used in this support mechanism provides varying degrees of purchase guarantees dependent on the kind of renewable energy source on a USD per MWh basis (Korkmaz & Önöz, 2022 ). According to the energy equivalents of municipal waste, the distribution of those suitable for incineration energy was 86%, while biomethanization was 14% (Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, 2023 ) (Fig. 18.4  ).    18.5 Applications/case studies 18.5.1 Waste-to-energy technologies Food waste, paper, cardboard, PET bottles, plastics, glass, textiles, metals, wood, leather, diapers, sludge, ash, and other materials are all included in municipal solid waste (MSW), also called trash or rubbish. Increased MSW generation in emerging nations is facilitated by rising urbanization, expanding populations, and technological advancements. Landfill gas (LFG) is produced during MSW treatment processes as a generator of greenhouse gases, mainly methane. As a result, every MSW removal procedure presents the potential for “waste-to-energy” (WTE) or the sustainable production of energy (Tozlu et al., 2016 ). Municipal solid waste (MSW) amounts and composition have been shifting due to changes in people’s consumption habits and the rapid development of technology (Ozcan et al., 2016 ). The study’s central thesis was that waste might be a novel (alternative) energy source. The current technical solutions need to be implemented, which involves considerable financial outlays, regulatory adjustments, and population behavior changes. Modernizing landfill management is frequently the key to modernizing waste management. This is insufficient from ecology, economy, and energy efficiency perspectives. It is necessary to create new institutional regulations and cutting-edge technologies. The authors suggest employing thermal catalytic depolymerization to turn waste into an energy source. The proposed technique also positively impacts the environment and is energy-efficient (Vertakova & Plotnikov, 2019 ). This high amount of waste production causes socioeconomic and ecological problems in developing countries, and sustainable disposal and energy production from waste options gain importance to overcome these problems (AlQattan et al., 2018 ). Solid waste is transformed into energy in electricity and heat through the thermochemical route through incineration, gasification, and pyrolysis (AlQattan et al., 2018 ). Incineration is one of the most used thermal processes. The basis of this process is generating electricity by incineration waste at high temperatures ranging from 800°C to 1200°C with oxygen (Varjani et al., 2022 ). During incineration, organic compounds degrade to carbon dioxide and water, while nonflammable compounds convert to ash (Vyas et al., 2022 ). In this process, the total waste weight and volume decrease by 90% and 70%, respectively (Beyene et al., 2018 ). On the other hand, the incineration process releases air pollutants such as sulfur oxides, carbon oxides, nitrogen oxides, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and heavy metals into the atmosphere that treat the environment. To overcome this problem, some additional treatment units can be used (Beyene et al., 2018 ). In gasification, solid waste thermally degrades without combustion at high temperature between 300°C and 800°C and in an inert atmosphere (Beyene et al., 2018; Vyas et al., 2022 ). Syngas, produced in this process, is used in gas turbines for electricity generation. Also,  50%–90% of waste volume can reduce during this process (Ouda et al., 2016 ). Pyrolysis is another thermochemical waste-to-energy process. In this process, waste thermally decomposes without oxygen at a high-temperature range of 300°C–1300°C. During this process, some air pollutants such as HCl, H2 S, NH3 , SOx , and NOx  are released into the atmosphere. To diminish this problem, some emission control equipment is used (Beyene et al., 2018 ). In the biochemical route, fermentation and biomethanation are the main processes that transform organic wastes into liquid or gaseous forms of energy (Thorin et al., 2012 ). During anaerobic digestion, waste is degraded by microorganisms at anaerobic conditions, and biogas is generated. This biogas contains methane (50%–75%), CO2  (25%–50%), and other gasses (1%–15%). The MSW character is crucial because only biodegradable pollutants are degraded in this process (Kumar & Samadder, 2017 ). This process has four steps: first, hydrolysis phase, organic waste is degraded to monomers by bacteria. The second phase is acidogenesis; bacteria convert monomers to short-chain fatty acids. Third phase is acedogen-type bacteria convert short-chain fatty acids to acetic acid. The acetic acid produced is used as the sole nutrient for methane-producing archaea. In the last phase, methane bacteria produce biogas using acetic acid (Beyene et al., 2018; Kumar & Samadder, 2017 ). This biogas is used for electricity generation, and it is reported that 2.04 kWh of electricity can be generated for 1 m3  of biogas during anaerobic digestion (Murphy et al., 2004 ). Landfilling gas is another biological route. MSW collected at sanitary landfill undergoes biological processes, and finally, landfill gas is produced. A landfill has two steps: (1) the operational stage, when MSW is deposited, and biogas generation begins; and (2) the closed stage, when the loading volume has given its maximum biogas output. During landfilling, the organic material undergoes biochemical decomposition, essentially anaerobic digestion in three phases, resulting in CH4  production in biogas (Beyene et al., 2018 ). The comparison of different WtE technologies is given in Table 18.1  . Landfill gas (LFG), created during municipal solid waste (MSW) processing, can be regarded as a source of greenhouse gases, primarily methane. Consequently, its management is crucial. LFG is gathered, treated, and used for power production as part of the methane production process in MSW facilities. However, numerous technologies, incineration, and landfilling techniques are popular worldwide because of their high potential energy output. The main environmental and economic issues in Türkiye have been the increased volume of solid waste produced by municipalities and other sources and its subsequent disposal (Tozlu et al., 2016 ).  18.5.2 WtE plants in the world The energy issue is significant because it directly affects socioeconomic and environmental indicators such as global pollution, poverty, income inequality, and economic   growth. A circular economy can be established by using resources judiciously, converting energy efficiently, and relying on renewable energy sources. To attain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), many nations have recently concentrated on energy efficiency strategies and introduced various legislative measures to help enhance energy efficiency. As a result, we emphasize how crucial energy efficiency is for environmentally friendly and circular waste management (Kocak & Baglitas, 2022 ). WtE technologies can be divided into three classes: landfill, biochemical transformation, and thermal transformation methods (incineration, pyrolysis, and gasification). In thermal transformation technology, incineration is the commonly employed method. The important part of “incineration” is that burning garbage away through controlled combustion at high temperatures is a process. The incineration approach may reduce the overall waste mass by roughly 70% while reducing the volume by 90%. The incineration process consists of three steps: incineration, energy recovery, and air pollution (Tozlu et al., 2016 ). Renewable energy technologies have increased due to limited and nonenvironmental-friendly fossil fuels and the increasing population. WtE is one of the most prominent renewable technologies in the world. WtE technologies have gained significant importance in the past three decades (Tozlu et al., 2016 ). Especially in developed countries, a considerable number of WtE plants have been established. It was reported in 2018 that Japan has the most WtE plants, with 1162 worldwide, followed by China, with 299. In Europe, France and Germany have 126 and 121 WtE plants, respectively (Öztürk & Bourtsalas, 2020 ).  18.5.3 WtE plants in Türkiye Many nations throughout the world are currently experiencing significant urbanization. The production of enormous quantities of solid garbage is one of the main effects of rapid urbanization. As the focus shifts from trash to energy, the use of municipal solid waste (MSW) to create free energy has become popular. The waste quality is influenced by many variables, including the local climate and eating habits (Baskar et al., 2022 ). Although the world’s WTE technology has a history dating back to the 1990s and most of Türkiye’s energy needs have been imported, Türkiye was unable to develop an effective MSW management technology until 2002. Recent government advances in line with Türkiye’s 2023 goal have accelerated the advancement of WTE technology in Türkiye over the past 20 years. By 2023, Türkiye’s electricity consumption was expected to be satisfied by renewable energy sources 30% (Tozlu et al., 2016 ). WtE applications in Türkiye have gained great significance in the past two decades due to the government’s renewable energy frames (Tozlu et al., 2016 ). The landfill is the most widely used waste disposal method; for this reason, facilities producing energy from landfill gas are widely used. According to the annual renewable energy  plant list, there are 106 WtE energy facilities in Türkiye, and these plants convert solid waste to landfill gas and biogas. In addition, the total installed power of these plants would be 657.7 MWm in 2023 (EPDK, 2023 ). There are also facilities where energy is obtained by burning hazardous wastes. Some WtE applications in Türkiye are given in Table 18.2  . In this section, some sample facilities are summarized. When compared with the number of WtE facilities in the world, Türkiye competes with the world (Öztürk & Bourtsalas, 2020 ). On the other hand, Kemeburgaz Istanbul Waste Incineration and Energy production facility, summarized in Section 7.1 , opened in 2021, is the largest WtE facility in Europe (Energy from Waste, 2023 ). İ.B.B (Istanbul metropolitan municipality) Istanbul Waste Incineration and Energy Production Facility (Fig. 18.5  ) is Europe’s biggest waste incineration and energy production facility, with a daily capacity of 3000 tons and an annual capacity of    approximately 1 million tons. The facility eliminates 15% of Istanbul’s day-to-day household waste, meets the electricity requirements of nearly 1.4 million people with the 85 MW of electricity it produces, and prevents the release of 1.38 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere annually. Organic wastes are processed and converted into electrical energy in a biomethanization facility. This facility will produce biogas from organic wastes in an oxygen-free environment. The obtained biogas generates electrical energy with an installed power of 1.4 MW (Energy from Waste, 2023 ). Odayeri Landfill Gas Power Plant can supply all of the daily electrical energy requirements of 68,090 people (including housing, industry, metro transportation, governmental offices, and environmental lighting) with its installed power of 33.81 MWe and average electricity production of 247 GWh. When sole household power usage is considered, the Odayeri Landfill Gas Power Plant can provide enough electricity to supply 82,793 homes (Biogas, Biomass, Waste Heat and Pyrolytic Oil Power Plants , 2023). Odayeri Landfill Gas Power Plant was established on 50 hectares and is 25 km from Istanbul. The first waste acceptance to this facility was in 1995, and the last waste acceptance was in 2012. The average and maximum waste heights are 19 and 70 m, respectively. Moreover, this facility’s electricity generation started in 2008 (ortadoguenerjigrubu, 2023 ). Seymen Landfill Gas power plant is Türkiye’s third largest biogas plant. The power plant is only half operational, and when total production begins, the installed power will be 52 MWe. Seymen Biomass Power Plant can supply all people’s daily electrical  energy requirements of 80,978 people (including housing, business, transit in urban areas, government buildings, and environmental illumination) with an average power output of 294,112,000 kilowatt-hours. Seymen Biomass Power Plant generates enough electricity to satisfy the demands of 98,464 homes, based only on household electricity usage (Biogas, Biomass, Waste Heat and Pyrolytic Oil Power Plants , 2023). This first phase of the Seymen Landfill Gas power plant was opened in 2020, will reach 66 megawatts in 2046, and will be the world’s largest landfill gas power generation facility in a single area (Seymen Power Plant, 2023 ). Kömürcüoda Landfill Gas power plant is on the Asian Side of Şile-Kömürcüoda Field. This facility was established on 40 hectares and is 55 km from Istanbul. The first waste acceptance to this facility was in 1995, and the last waste acceptance was in 2012. The average and maximum waste heights are 19 and 70 m, respectively. Moreover, this facility’s electricity generation started in 2009 (ortadoguenerjigrubu, 2023 ). This facility’s installed capacity is 14.15 MWe and an average electricity production of 91,464,277 kWh, and the Kömürcüoda Landfill Gas power plant can cover all the electrical energy demands of 25,183 people daily. When only residential electricity consumption is considered, the Kömürcüoda Dumpster Biogas Power Plant generates enough electricity to power 30,621 homes (Biogas, Biomass, Waste Heat and Pyrolytic Oil Power Plants , 2023). In this facility, collected gas is brought to the appropriate temperature and humidity using a transmission system and then converted into electrical energy by motors. For this purpose, 20-cylinder, 12-gas engines with four-stroke, spark ignition, turbocharger, 1500 rpm, and shaft power of 1451 kW are used (ortadoguenerjigrubu, 2023 ). IZAYDAS is the first solid waste disposal facility established in Türkiye. This facility is located in Izmıt province and has accepted waste since 1977. In this plant, hazardous waste is incinerated and converted to energy. In 2018 approximately 24,000 tons of hazardous waste were burned, and the energy production from wastes was above 15,000,000 W in 2018 at IZAYDAS (Menteşe & Kızılcam, 2021 ). Moreover, in this facility, biogas plants also generate electricity. Daily 30 tonne waste such as grass carpet waste, tripe inside waste, chicken waste, and cattle manure feed to biogas plants to produce energy. In Izmıt, a daily 1600-ton MSW is converted to electricity in IZAYDAS. This facility has operated for 16 years, and up to now, it is estimated that nearly 133 million kWh of electricity is generated from MSW (IZAYDAS, 2023 ).  18.5.4 Case studies In the literature, MSW regarding energy technologies for Gaziantep province has been evaluated. In this study, the importance of management is emphasized because the increased waste will create environmental and economic problems. It is stated that there is an installed capacity of 5.66 MW in energy production from landfill gas for  Gaziantep province, but this energy meets 1.25% of Gaziantep’s total energy need. It has also been suggested that an incineration plant can be established as an alternative (Tozlu et al., 2016 ). In a study on energy production from food waste in hospitals, estimations were made with the help of a semiempirical model. This study stated that the energy consumed in hospitals in Türkiye in 2018 constituted 3.3% of Türkiye’s overall. It has been reported that 86.1 GWh of energy can be produced from food waste (Melikoglu, 2020 ). According to a study evaluating WTE technologies for countries with different income groups, estimations were made for Türkiye, Brazil, and Germany with the help of the model. Gasification and incineration are the most effective methods for energy production from waste, but anaerobic digestion is the most cost-effective method for energy production from waste, considering the economy (Firtina-Ertis et al., 2021 ).   18.6 Latest research/recent developments 18.6.1 Sustainable development goals and Türkiye The United Nations has developed a 2030 agenda with 17 goals centered on the prosperity, peace, and international cooperation of people and the planet to promote sustainable development. Türkiye has made noteworthy advancements in reaching the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) since their adoption in 2015. Here are some of the key achievements: No Poverty (SDG 1):  Türkiye has achieved big targets in alleviating poverty over the past decade. The poverty rate has declined to 9.2% in 2019 from 23.5% in 2002. In any case, there is still a problem in dealing with poverty. Zero Hunger (SDG 2):  Türkiye has been more determined to improve food security, lessen malnutrition rates, and support sustainable agricultural methods. Good Health and Well-being (SDG 3):  Türkiye has enhanced health and well-being. Life expectancy has improved from 67.2 years in 2002 to 78.2 years in 2019. Türkiye has made noteworthy advancements in refining access to healthcare services. The republic has a worldwide healthcare system that shelters all citizens and provides allowed medical treatment in public clinics. Quality Education (SDG 4):  Türkiye has accomplished widespread access to primary schooling, and the registration rate in secondary education has upgraded to 94%. Türkiye has attained gender equivalence in primary and secondary education and has raised the enrollment rate of girls in primary and secondary institutes. Gender Equality (SDG 5):  Türkiye has improved in lessening gender imbalances. The gender pay gap has been reduced, and the image of women in Parliament has augmented to 17%. The republic accepted a law in 2012 to guard women from local violence and has established a national hotline for sufferers of domestic violence. Clean Water and Sanitation (SDG 6):  This objective pledges  general access to water and sanitary facilities and maintainable management. It covers objectives to reduce water pollution, encourage access to clean drinking water, and advance water quality. Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7):  This objective concentrates on growing access to cheap, consistent, maintainable, and up-to-date energy. It contains targets to increase renewable energy’s portion in the worldwide energy combination and advance energy efficiency. Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8):  Türkiye has reached continuous economic growth over the past decade, with an average yearly growth rate of 5.5% between 2002 and 2018. The joblessness rate reduced from 10.3% in 2009 to 12.7% in 2019. Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (SDG 9):  Türkiye has financed infrastructure improvement, inspiring innovation and technological progress. Reduced Inequalities (SDG 10):  Notwithstanding development in dropping poverty, income inequality rests high in Türkiye. World Bank states that the top 20% of the habitants earn nearly seven times more than the bottom 20%. Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11):  Türkiye has made advancements in refining city infrastructure and lessening pollution. For example, the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality has introduced a series of proposals to decrease air pollution. Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12):  Türkiye has executed strategies to encourage accountable consumption and production, involving a nationwide recycling agenda. Climate Action (SDG 13):  Türkiye is a noteworthy emitter of greenhouse gases and has sluggishly transitioned to renewable energy sources. The nation also confronts challenges linked to water scarcity and desertification. Life Below Water (SDG 14):  Türkiye has been running to shield marine ecosystems and biodiversity, plus efforts to challenge marine pollution and overfishing. Life on Land (SDG 15):  Türkiye has been applying numerous plans to protect and restore ecosystems, combat desertification, and combat biodiversity. Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions (SDG 16):  Türkiye has confronted disapproval over limitations on freedom of speech and the media. The state has correspondingly practiced political unpredictability and struggle in recent years. Partnerships for the Goals (SDG 17):  Türkiye has enthusiastically engaged in national, regional, and global collaborations to back the SDGs’ implementation (Sachs et al., 2022 ). The “sustainable development” approach is based on waste management strategies that aim to slow down the rapid consumption of natural resources and turn the wastes produced into an economic input rather than a threat to the environment and human health. This approach is increasingly being adopted as a priority policy target worldwide. Municipal SWM for a zero-waste city is one area where the Model for Urban Waste Management should be based on a system where residents are actively involved and motivated by incentives (Hoşoğlu, 2022 ). A shared vision for wealth and peace for the earth and people is provided by the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), first presented in 2015. Ten of the 17 SDGs can be connected to sustainable solid waste collection models and optimization  directly or indirectly. Solid waste collection impacts several SDG categories, such as the environment, public health, poverty, and resource value. Clean water, good health, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, clean energy, sustainable cities, economic development, access to green jobs, and sustainable use of natural resources are among the impacted domains (Yalçıntaş et al., 2023 ). Türkiye ranks 71st out of 163 nations in the 2022 Sustainable Development Report (Sachs et al., 2022 ). The index score (Fig. 18.6  ) increased from 66 in 2018 to 70.4 in 2022 (Sachs et al., 2018, 2022 ). According to the report, Türkiye’s 17 aims focus more on the need to take action. According to the SDG report of 2022, while moderately improving was observed in goal 7, the challenges remain; however, significant challenges continue to exist despite moderately improving in goal 11. Goal 12 has on track or maintains SDG achievement and significant challenges (Fig. 18.7  ). According to Goal 7, the place of renewable energy in energy resources has increased. This situation may have been caused by the waste-to-energy recovery facilities opened in recent years and the state subsidies for renewable energy sources. There is an increase in the number of nonrecycled municipal solid waste (kg/capita/day) and significant challenges in Goal 12 (Sachs et al., 2022 ).  18.6.2 The sustainable development goals and waste-to-energy approach Increasing population and urbanization increased energy demand. Fossil fuels mainly meet this demand; however, fossil fuels treat the environment dramatically. The world desperately needs sustainable urban development to respond to high energy demand  and waste levels (Ouda et al., 2016 ). Increasing population and urbanization increased energy demand. Fossil fuels mainly meet this demand; however, fossil fuels treat the environment dramatically. The world desperately needs sustainable urban development to respond to high energy demand and waste levels (Kaya et al., 2021 ). Overall, sustainability through solid waste management is a critical issue for Türkiye, and the country has set ambitious goals to achieve sustainable development in this area. While significant progress has been made in recent years, continued investment and innovation will be required to meet these goals and ensure a sustainable future for Türkiye. By attaining these goals, Türkiye would be better able to safeguard the environment and the general population. Solid waste management is a crucial issue for the country. Waste-to-energy is crucial to sustainable waste management strategies that can help achieve the SDGs. Although Türkiye has achieved great strides in waste-to-energy projects recently, issues such as insufficient source segregation and project finance persist. Further work is required to overcome these obstacles and fulfill Türkiye’s waste-to-energy SDG. Several barriers prevent Türkiye from attaining its waste-to-energy SDG. Insufficient waste segregation at the source is one of the significant issues. Lack of source separation results in more contamination and lower-quality waste for energy recovery, which can reduce the effectiveness of waste-to-energy facilities. Additionally, waste-to-energy projects require significant investment, which may be challenging for local municipalities to finance. Türkiye, on the other hand, has set many sustainability and solid waste management−related objectives to address the zero waste problem. These aims comprise: (1) Reducing the amount of solid waste produced: Türkiye promotes waste avoidance, segregation, and recycling at the source to lower the amount paid by homes, businesses,  and industrial facilities. (2) Increasing the reuse, recycling, and recovery rates of solid waste: Türkiye wants to lower the amount of garbage dumped in landfills by improving solid waste’s recycling and recovery rates. (3) Türkiye seeks to enhance the standard of solid waste management services nationwide, including garbage collection, transportation, and disposal. (4) Reducing the harmful effects of solid waste on the environment and public health: Türkiye promotes sustainable waste management methods to reduce the detrimental impact of solid waste on the environment, human health, and natural resources. Türkiye has put into effect several initiatives and programs to meet these objectives, including: • Promoting waste segregation at the source: Türkiye has started awareness-raising programs to persuade individuals and organizations to divide their waste into recyclable and nonrecyclable categories. • Increasing the network of waste collection and transportation services: Türkiye has invested in increasing the availability of garbage collection and transportation services, particularly in rural areas. • Promoting the building of integrated waste management facilities, such as composting and recycling facilities, sanitary landfills, and waste-to-energy plants: Türkiye has encouraged the construction of integrated waste management facilities.   18.7 Future implications Due to the high amount of solid waste, SWM will be crucial for many countries, including developing countries such as Türkiye. Many issues still need to be solved to build sustainable solid waste management methods. The lack of public engagement and knowledge in waste reduction and segregation is one of the significant difficulties. Individuals, families, and communities must actively participate in trash reduction, segregation, and recycling if waste management is to be effective. This calls for educational and awareness-raising activities, incentives, and rules supporting ethical waste management methods. The absence of sufficient infrastructure and resources for garbage management is another problem. Many Turkish towns still lack the equipment and facilities to collect, transport, and properly dispose of trash. Significant investments are required in the infrastructure for waste management, including recycling facilities and waste-to-energy technologies. The long-term viability of SWM procedures also depends on the nation’s political and economic stability. Implementing sustainable waste management techniques might be hampered by political unrest and financial crises, undermining advancements in this field. Continued investment, innovation, and cooperation between various stakeholders, including the government, industry, and civil society, will be necessary to address these challenges. The sustainable solid waste management techniques in Türkiye and other nations would safeguard the environment and public health and help those nations achieve Sustainable Development Goals and create a more sustainable future for all.   18.8 Conclusion In the past two decades, sustainability has gained importance in reducing and preventing the problems brought by climate change. In this context, with the production of energy from waste, both the reduction of wastes and the formation of environmental risks are prevented, and the use of fossil resources is reduced. In total, 168 countries, including Türkiye, are evaluated periodically within the framework of Sustainable Development Goals. In SDG goals, mainly when goals 7 and 11 are assessed in terms of energy production from waste, it is seen that Türkiye has made progress in energy production from waste. Although electricity from landfill gas is generally preferred, there has been a significant increase in facilities producing energy from waste with increased government incentives. In addition, the portion of renewable energy has improved with the opening of Europe’s largest waste-to-energy production facility.   References Abdollahi Saadatlu et al., 2022 E.
