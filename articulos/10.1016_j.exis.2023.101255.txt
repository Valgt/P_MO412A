The local authorities (Municipalities) agreed with Freeport-McMoran that the mine would support the designing and development of the wastewater treatment plant and that the Water National Authority would work on the plant.

The primary purpose of this research is to clarify the meaning of shared value in the mining industry by using terms from the stakeholders’ and strategy literature.

The evidence shows that the framework proposed requires the following terms to clarify the meaning of shared value: creating shared value strategies, types of processes in the industry, initiatives, stakeholders, and sustainable development goals.   Keywords Corporate social responsibility (CSR)  Shared value creation  Sustainable development goals  Mining industry    1 Introduction Shared values require a socioeconomic metamorphosis where social needs drive the business instead of the common economic goals (Porter and Kramer, 2011 ). Shared weight redefines the convergence among business and society as reciprocal cooperation, aimed at the shared objective of inciting benefits for society. This idea is unmistakable in the current formulation of business as discrete from civil society and mainly centered on generating wealth for shareholders while creating charitable projects to intensify their image and public respect. The emphasis of creating shared value (CSV) is the groundbreaking restructure of society and business. One way to demonstrate shared value creation is to contribute to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are a global call to end poverty, protect the environment, and improve the lives and prospects of the world's population. All UN member states adopted the 17 goals in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which set out a 15-year plan to achieve these ends. “Shared value” has since expanded into various disciplines (Dembek et al., 2016 ). Nonetheless, its present formulation is obscure and there are significant disagreements in its definition and operation, enhancing the buzzword rather than its essential concept. Shared value additionally includes numerous associated concepts and a scarce empirical base. These concepts can be categorized under the following: (1) initiatives to create shared value; (2) resulting outcomes of the shared value; and (3) beneficiaries. A method to establish the definition of shared value is the clarification of the manners, heirs, and sustainable development goal contribution (Dembek et al., 2016 ). On the other hand, mining companies have been reporting their contribution to the communities where they operate (i.e., they state that they create shared value but the way they express these contributions varies). For example, they use the Global Reporting Initiative standard, where they incorporate their contribution to the sustainable development objectives, mention shared value strategies and identify the stakeholders benefited. However, there is no standard format that relates shared value strategies with beneficiaries, indicators, and sustainable development objectives. Therefore, future research on shared value should be established to clarify its strategic concept through manners, outcomes, and heirs while nurturing social capital and equivalent concepts from a stakeholder perspective. The following research question then arises: How can the meaning of creating shared value be clarified in the mining industry? Therefore, the main contribution of this paper is that it demonstrates the importance of creating shared value in the mining industry by defining CSV strategies, initiatives, beneficiaries, and indicators using sustainable development goals (SDG), and thus improves the theoretical understanding of the issue of creating shared value, as well as improving the sustainability reporting by companies. The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2 , a literature review is presented that focuses on the definition of shared value, the strategies used in the mining sector, the beneficiaries and the impact indicators measured that provide a bedrock for analysis. Second, the methodology is presented. In Section 4 , the results are presented in order, in line with the framework presented, followed by a discussion in which specific issues in the mining sector that companies take into consideration when it comes to generating shared value are identified. Finally, the conclusion is presented in which the main findings, limitations and proposals for future research are outlined.  2 Literature review The shared value creation idea, introduced by Porter and Kramer (2006) , implies that firms can concomitantly generate economic and social values by targeting the needs and challenges of society. To grow a firm´s superior service and administration, shared value creation needs influential leaders within the firm's context to develop new skills and knowledge. At that point, new paths for innovation are opened, and shared value is created (Porter and Kramer, 2011 ). At the same time, numerous organizations and activities have nurtured global contributions from the mining industry to sustainable development (CCSI et al., 2016 ). Mining companies should then create suitable development methodologies to maximize SDG contributions by considering region-specific challenges. The paper sheds light on the meaning of shared value in the mining industry by clarifying the strategies, initiatives, and outcomes and their beneficiaries within the mining industry. A framework is developed, therefore, based on the following terms: CSV strategies, strategy in the sector, initiatives, heirs, and outcomes (the SDGs). 2.1 Creating a shared value strategy in mining Codes and operating methods that intensify a firm's competitiveness while simultaneously improving social conditions within the communities they serve are the CSV definition that most authors use (Porter and Kramer, 2011 ). Three paths are associated with shared value creation, which are mutually reinforced. First, firms that continue to explore societal needs will find the latest prospects for differentiation within traditional markets and will perceive the conditions for secondary markets. Secondly, the collaboration among social advancement within the value chain increases when companies address social issues from a CSV perspective and design innovative operational methods to address them all throughout the value chain. Thirdly, productivity and innovation are unequivocally impacted by firm clusters within a particular industry. Finally, creating shared value requires custom-fitted and current types of cooperation for each business unit within these three paths (Porter and Kramer, 2011 ). The Shared Value Initiative and FSG (2014)  spotlight how firms within the oil, gas, and mining industries can generate shared value by pursuing opportunities that bind business prosperity to communities’ and countries' progress and advancement, frequently in cooperation with governments, nonprofit organizations, multilateral institutions, and, paradoxically, the competition. There are levels of shared value creation for extractive firms (Shared Value Initiative and FSG, 2014 ): First, mining projects should be reformulated to obtain a social license from the local community through the extractive activity (e.g., drinking water and electricity). Second, productivity within value chains should be redefined. For example, local workforce competences should be improved, value chain suppliers strengthened, local disaster and emergency readiness, responsiveness and rehabilitation competencies increased, and water, energy, and other resources utilization improved. Lastly, an entitling local environment should be created.  2.2 A social responsibility project (tactics) aimed at creating competitive advantage A competitive strategy determines a firm's development and sustainability for its competitive advantages based on a set of planned strategic measures. The strategic management area is essentially concerned with how firms grow and sustain competitive advantages (Porter and Kramer, 2011 ). Business strategy requires that a firm must generate a distinct value proposition that meets the needs of a chosen group of clients to be fruitful. Shared value involves defining an entirely new group of top practices that all firms must grasp, eventually transforming into an essential element of the strategy. The core of a plan is selecting a unique and contrasting position and value chain to deliver. New needs and paths to build the value chain emerge due to shared value. The competitive advantages that arise from CSV are frequently more sustainable than traditional cost and quality enhancement. The imitation-cycle and zero-sum competition can be fragmented (Porter and Kramer, 2011 ). Likewise, here are sector-specific suggested practices for the mining industry. Proposed by various influential organizations, such as the United Nations Development Program (UNDP, 2016 ), which consists of a previous online public consultation and a release of the Mapping Mining to the Sustainable Development Goals: An Atlas. The Atlas endorses various sustainable development strategies for mining firms. The following document links all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their subheadings to mining industry activities (Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment et al., 2016 ).  2.3 Initiatives to create shared value Dembek et al. (2016)  mentioned that the following words and phrases: initiative, policies and operating practices, global commercial initiatives, and choices contain some sense of CSV. Furthermore, the extent of policies and procedures is limited to redesigning products, the value chain, and building clusters. On the other hand, global commercial initiatives limit the shared value range to one explicit extent: a commercial activity involving several countries. Consequently, the rationale would imply that the measures demanding one government or not directly related to a commercial extent cannot be determined as a CSV (Maltz and Schein, 2012 ). Additionally, it is unclear whether CSV is connected to a specific project, an initiative of a firm, coordinated activities of several firms, or altogether (Dembek et al., 2016 ). Currently, some examples of shared value refer to the singular initiative, while others refer to CSV organizations. Likewise, the foundation on which decisions are made regarding shared values is unclear. For instance, following Porter and Kramer (2011) , CSV policies and operating practices ban personal values, while other authors recommend that values are crucial factors of a firm's capacity to CSV.  2.4 The indicators of shared value using the SDGs as guidance The Shared Value indicator comprises a broad scope of concepts, specifically, competitiveness, social and economic environment, social value (Shrivastava and Kennelly, 2013 ), benefits, and social progress. Accurate interpretations of these ideas for human needs have been discussed for many years. Consideration of three essential aspects of shared value outcomes from the perspective of the needs is imperative (Dembek et al., 2016 ): which needs are addressed, how they are addressed, and whether they are satisfied. Additionally, part of a sustainable development strategy is a series of global indicators used to observe and evaluate the progress against both overall goals and specific targets (Yakovleva et al., 2017 ; Barakos. and Mischo, 2021 ). These SDG indicators depict results set up by the United Nations Statistical Commission (UNSC), which is responsible for the advancements of the global indicator methodology cooperatively with the UNSC.  2.5 Shared value and stakeholders (beneficiaries) Stakeholders represent a group that a firm needs for existence: consumers, suppliers, employees, finance, and communities (Freeman and Moutchnik, 2013 ). From a stakeholder point of view a business could be described as a series of interactions and connections between groups involved in activities that create the company, (Clarkson, 1995 ; Lindman et al., 2020; Hitch and Barakos, 2021 ; Collins and Kumral, 2021 ). This relationship concerns how consumers, suppliers, employees, financiers, communities, and managers collaborate to create and trade value (Freeman, 1984 ) cooperatively. To comprehend a business is to understand how these connections work and evolve gradually. Moreover, it is the executive's job to oversee and form these connections to generate the highest value feasible for stakeholders and to manage its distribution. The manager must find a way of reanalyzing issues where stakeholders conflict arises in order to address the needs of a broad group of stakeholders and to the point that more value ought to be created for each (Donaldson and Preston, 1995 ). If a trade-off needs to be made, the executives must calculate how and work on constant improvement for each side. Contradictorily, CSV is mainly imagined as a win-win situation that requires greater cooperation and stakeholder management (Boutilier, 2021 ). Following authors Dembek et al. (2016) , CSV definitions are divided into two groups: the shared value definition (Porter and Kramer, 2011 ) as a conceptual theory; and shared value terms from a stakeholder point of view, such as firm-value and social actors (Maltz et al., 2011 ), social needs, and resources to improve quality of life. Furthermore, author Crane et al. (2014)  accentuated the likeness of CSV (Porter and Kramer, 2011 ), stakeholder theory (Freeman and Moutchnik, 2013 ) (stakeholder value increases shareholder value), and the “blended value” concept (concomitant examination of profit and socio-environmental targets). Additionally, the social point of view regarding value creation must incorporate critical, multi-stakeholder dialog processes (prompting possible tensions) to guarantee more comprehensive solutions to difficulties (Crane et al., 2014 ).  2.6 Stakeholders and beneficiaries of the indicators of shared value There is irregularity within statements of who is the beneficiary (Dembek et al., 2016 ). In other words, is it the firm and its various social actors (Maltz et al., 2011 ; Thomson and Boutilier, 2011 ), all the actors, the whole value chain and society, or would it be sufficient if beneficiaries consist of a company and a particular social category, as some empirical evidence suggests (Porter and Kramer, 2011 )? Also, should nature be contemplated as a different beneficiary, or ought environmental value be taken into consideration only to the degree to which it benefits both firms and communities? This is a reminder that needs are settled in human systems of value co-creation and the significance of a systemic point of view, as referenced in the previous subsection. Therefore, it is necessary to respond to these inquiries in three aspects: initiatives, SDGs contributions, and beneficiaries, to determine shared values (Dembek et al., 2016 ; Veenker and Vanclay. 2021 ). So, to answer the research question "how could the meaning of creating shared value be clarified?" the following framework based on the previous literature is proposed (See Table 1  ).   3 Methods A qualitative analysis was designed using the content analysis technique. A content analysis systematically collects the available sources of information and samples the messages and codes them. The codes can be predefined based on the literature, but they can also arise from the data as they are being analyzed (Saenz, 2020a ). 3.1 The sample A study sample from the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) was utilized to test the research questions proposed in this study. The decision was made to use ICMM members as a sample because the ICMM wants to increase recognition of its members’ contributions to local communities. Members of the ICMM include the following major mining firms (See Table 2  ). The unit of analysis was the social responsibility project, duly reported in each firm's social responsibility report; hence, information and data associated with the social responsibility projects of the firms in the sample were taken from each social responsibility report from 2015 to 2019. As a result, there were 53 comprehensive sustainability reports: n total, seven companies reported once, and 20 reported twice or more. These data are in the public domain; therefore, it was decided that no firm should be contacted to obtain formal permission before directing the research. Each selected social responsibility report was thoroughly reviewed, and information related to activities that help people reach the SDGs was extracted.  3.2 Data analysis The study used secondary sources, which were analyzed via the content analysis technique. According to Fernandez (2002) , this method fits qualitative research, when the material to be analyzed consists of words and themes to be interpreted. However, it is also appropriate for a deeper analysis of a text or texts. Previous studies using corporate internet data have used the same content analysis methodology to analyze a variety of subjects, including the transparency of corporate information provided, the diffusion of CSR reports within the finance industry, and the diffusion of CSR data throughout Latin American business environments. However, the companies reported according to the Global Reporting Initiatives protocol, and they neither identified their actions as CSV initiatives nor necessarily mapped their initiatives to the SDGs. The coding process was as follows: each social responsibility initiative was coded according to the code list in Table 3  . Each code corresponds to one SDG. Then, codes were grouped into categories that represented different types of social responsibility projects. Next, the frequency of the classes was tabulated, and then the categories were grouped into themes representing different CSV strategies. Finally, beneficiaries were also identified (See Table 4a, 4b and 4c ).   4 Discussion and conclusion Table 4 shows the distributions of the strategies according to shared value theory (Porter and Kramer, 2011 ). All of the companies were working on all seventeen SDGs, and the total number of initiatives was 1731 (100%). The total number of initiatives related to the first shared value strategy (reconceiving mining project) is 450 (26.3%). The number of activities connected to the subsequent strategy of shared value (redefining productivity in value chains) is 728 (41.3%), and the number of activities related to the third strategy of shared value (creating an enabling local environment) is 553 (31.9%) (Alcoa, 2021 ; AngloAmerica, 2019 ; Anglo Gold Ashanti, 2018 ; Antofagasta Minerals 2019 ; ARM, 2021 ; Barrick, 2021 ; BHP, 2021 ; Codelco, 202; Hydro, 2021; Minera San Cristobal S.A.,2019 ; Minsur, 2019 ; MMG, 2019 ; Newcrest, 2019 ; Newmont, 2019 ; Orano, 2019 ; Polyus, 2019 ; Rio Tinto, 2019 ; Sibanye-Stillwater, 2019 ; South32, 2019 ; Teck, 2019 ; Vale, 2019 ). Regarding the first shared value strategy (reconceiving mining project) the main beneficiary is the community with 21.17% of total of 26.3%. With respect the second shared value strategy the main beneficiaries are the environment (17.6%) and employees (14.27%) of the total of 41.3%. Finally, the last shared value strategy, the main beneficiary is the community 29.5% of the total of 32%. 4.1 Redesigning products and markets The literature on social conflicts in mining reveals that there are many reasons for disputes and the consequences of these conflicts mean losses for everyone, such as the cancelation of mining projects, production stoppages for extended periods generating economic losses for companies, loss of life due to confrontation between community members and law enforcement, among others (Thomson and Boutilier, 2011 ; Veenker and Vanclay, 2021 ). There are sensitive social issues for communities that need to be addressed by mining companies in a different and resourceful way. Therefore, companies are redesigning projects on topics that have generated distrust and social conflicts, such as water, the inclusion of communities in development decision-making, environment, land and human rights. With this redesign, companies have improved their relationships with communities and have allowed mining projects to move forward (Lindman et al., 2020 ; Hitch and Barakos, 2021 ; Collins and Kumral, 2021 ). Regarding water, the results show that companies use strategies to demonstrate that mining can generate water supply for mining operations, agriculture and the population by investing in water and sanitation infrastructure and water treatment plants. The strategies identified are social, cultural and technical consideration for water treatment, drinkable water, sanitation aid, and infrastructure, finding synergies where mining and agriculture operate together, and designing infrastructure with shared benefits to agriculture (Boutilier, 2021 ). Regarding the inclusion of communities in development, the results indicate that companies are using strategies that generate the participation of communities in permanent dialog to prevent social conflicts and discuss development projects that allow community members to improve their living conditions. The strategies identified are: participating in talks, strengthening coordination between initiatives, preventing company-community conflict, targeting diverse groups with social investments, and encouraging participatory budgeting (Barakos. and Mischo, 2021 ; Saenz, 2018a ). Concerning the environment, companies and communities must reduce and mitigate environmental pollution. In this sense, the findings suggest that companies are redesigning their projects by incorporating strategies such as preserving ecosystem services, implementing biodiversity offsets, financing entrepreneurs regarding biodiversity and the community, cooperation within local and regional forecasting and green space development contribution, among others (Saenz and Ostos 2020a ). Finally, land and human rights refer to the acquisition of land by mining companies where the communities must transfer their land so that minerals can be extracted. This transfer must be carried out fairly and respect the customs and times of the communities. For this, the results indicate that companies are incorporating prior consent considerations, implementing human rights impact assessments and premature organization of land access, transfer, and income reconditioning to achieve the social license to operate (Saenz and Ostos 2020b ). Table 5  shows some examples of how the first strategy of CSV (reconceiving products and markets) contribute to SDGs using the framework created.  4.2 Redefining productivity in value chains According to the results obtained, shared value through the value chain of companies can be classified into procurement, climate change, human resources, the environment and marine impact. Concerning procurement, companies generate shared value in two ways: first, by prioritizing local procurement, strengthening supplier capacity and developing employees through strategies such as steering economic growth with local acquisition and supplier development strategies, assisting local acquisition and skills growth, and expanding the inclusiveness of direct jobs. Secondly, sustainable resources are acquired to ensure responsible consumption by building local, regional and national procurement strategies and implementing responsible sourcing (Saenz, 2018b , 2019a ). Regarding climate change, companies are taking steps to reduce their impact on climate change using strategies such as adopting a corporate policy to address climate change, reducing, measuring and reporting emissions, coordinating both firm's strategy with national initiatives and sharing the firm's policy on climate change and building climate change resilience. Concerning human resources, companies are implementing strategies to protect the health and safety of workers and to generate fair and equal treatment among them as follows: ameliorating job-related health and safety, including road safety, preventing non-communicable diseases (NCDs), anticipating, mitigating and monitoring of infectious illnesses, fighting tuberculosis (TB) and HIV/AIDS in employees, nurturing mental health, hindering substance abuse and domestic violence, funding education for the workforce through instruction and technical programs, creating scholarships and new graduate programs in employment strategies, ensuring equal opportunities for women, and ensuring gender-sensitive work environments (Saenz, 2020a ). Regarding the environment and marine impact, companies are implementing strategies to reduce and mitigate the environmental effects of their operations, for example:• minimizing mine inputs and waste, environmentally safe management of chemicals and all wastes implementation throughout their development  • setting up marine conservation areas and contributing to research and planning  • avoiding damaging effects on critical habitat and shifting towards no net loss and net gain    Table 6  shows examples of how mining companies are applying some strategies to redefine productivity in the value chain (Saenz, 2020b ).  4.3 Creating an enabling local environment (Porter and Kramer, 2011 ) The main social topics that mining companies are addressing to improve local environmental conditions are health, education, economic development, and transparency. Concerning social health, companies are collaborating to strengthen health services and plan the response to epidemics (Saenz, 2019b ). Regarding social education, companies are implementing training programs to improve local business capabilities, promote inclusive access and help to keep children in school and promote training and refresher programs for teachers. Moreover, companies are trying to scale up their economic contribution by implementing strategies such as setting up business incubators and small business support centers, using business profiles to encourage the modeling of horizontal linkages, using convening power to create clusters, and encouraging local research and development assessments. Finally, companies are performing strategies to improve transparency, such as spearheading forthrightness, promoting the rule of law, and visibly mobilizing resources (Saenz, 2019c , 2020c ). Table 7  shows examples of how the third strategy of CSV (Creating an enabling local environment) contributes to SDGs using the framework created.   5 Concluding remarks The framework presented considers the following terms: creating shared value strategies in the industry context, initiatives, stakeholders or beneficiaries, and indicators (SDG). This framework contributes to the understanding of the definition of CSV by showing how these terms progress from a corporate strategy to an approach grounded in the SDGs, as follows:• CSV strategies: strategy related to a corporate strategy (Porter and Kramer, 2011 ).  • Strategies in the industry: types of strategy (e.g., functional, generic, differentiation, cost focus, and cost leadership); strengthening suppliers in the value chain; and improving utilization of resources used in operations (Shared Value Initiative and FSG, 2014 ).  • Initiatives: detailed description of the strategies in the industry (policies, operating practices, etc.). Additionally, there could be many initiatives of strategy, e.g., if the strategy in the industry is to improve the usage of water, then there could be many initiatives, for example; (1) recycling water, (2) installing sensors in water faucets, and (3) creating and implementing water policy.  • Beneficiaries: stakeholders impacted by the activity of the company.  • Indicators: outcomes related to SDG indicators.    In a mining context, creating shared value has to slightly modify its first strategy, which involves the product and market, because this strategy was developed with consumers in mind. Instead, the most critical stakeholder in the mining context is the surrounding community (not the customers). Therefore, mining companies must create strategies to prevent social conflicts with the community while coping with critical topics such as land, water, community engagement, the environment, and human rights. These strategies aim to reduce the communities’ fears concerning the main issues that worry them, such as environmental contamination, water supply for agriculture and the population, respect for the human rights of community members and the active participation of the communities in the development. With these strategies, companies achieve better acceptance of their mining projects because communities feel that they are heeded and generate the expected benefits of the mining activity. The following questions could help mining companies create a valuable proposition for the community: What are the fears of communities regarding mining projects? How can we improve the mining proposal to reduce these fears and build trust? Which communities are mining companies going to benefit? Which of their needs (SDGs) are mining companies going to try to meet? The second strategy of CSV considers that every activity in the value chain (procurement, climate change, human resources, the environment and the marine impact) touches the communities in which the firm operates. This interaction between the company and the community throughout the value chain generates shared value only when the company prioritizes community development in its production activities, purchasing, good treatment of its employees, and care for the environment. Consequently, mining companies could use the value chain to achieve SDGs. The third strategy of CSV, which develops clusters supporting the mining companies, can help to achieve SDGs through capacity building of suppliers, improving the economic conditions of communities, as well as the health, education and transparency of their activities. The proposed framework can help understand the meaning of shared value creation and improve companies’ reporting in order to connect their value creation strategies with beneficiaries and sustainable development objectives. The limitations of this research, which appeals for a detailed results interpretation and further analysis to improve generalizability and validation, are as follows: A more comprehensive sample of firms ought to assist results in generalizability enhancement. Moreover, the SDGs are based on the strategy used to improve a specific topic (the environment, human resources, communities, and others), and it is not based on collecting data in the field. This research contributes to the comprehension of CSV meaning and provides a strategic perspective of CSV towards supplying shared value for business and society, despite the limitations. Future research could be conducted on the following topics: (1) developing strategies in the industry according to corporate social responsibility literature, (2) identifying beneficiaries considering stakeholder analysis, approach and engagement, and (3) developing outcome indicators according to the project and SDGs      .
