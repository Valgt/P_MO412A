                  The shipping industry of cargo containers is a very efficient freight mode, yet it is still entirely reliant on fossil fuels. While sustainable fuels penetrate the market, carbon capture and storage has been proposed as an interim solution for low-carbon shipping. In this work, we assess the technical feasibility, economic and environmental performance of a cargo ship with a retrofitted carbon capture plant on-board that captures 94 % of direct emissions at 85 $2019/tCO2. Compared to the current scenario, our solution reduces climate change by 50 %, while the direct air capture technology stands at a 45 % reduction. Our environmental assessment is based on absolute thresholds to quantify the impacts relative to the Earth's carrying capacity and shows that burden-shifting occurs in all the categories but climate change.

Keywords container ship  maritime emissions  carbon capture on-board  life cycle assessment  Sustainable Development Goals    1 Introduction The shipping industry is one of the most efficient transportation modes: it only contributed to approximately 3 % of the global GHG emissions in 2018 (IMO, 2021 ) while moving 80 % of the total cargo by sea (Istrate et al., 2022 ). Nonetheless, this sector is still heavily reliant on fossil fuels and its decarbonization was never part of the goals set in the Paris Agreement (Rogelj et al., 2016 ). Despite the measures adopted to reduce the environmental impact of the shipping industry (IMO, 2022), its emissions are still projected to increase due to population and consequent freight demand growth. Long-term solutions are based on a complete switch of the current fleet to low- or zero-carbon fuels, with a non-negligible change in the infrastructure, i.e., they require compatible engines and bigger fuel storage tanks on-board to compensate for the lower volumetric energy densities. While these sustainable fuels, such as hydrogen, ammonia and methanol, are introduced into the market, interim solutions based on carbon (CO2 ) captured directly at the source (DNV, 2022) or from the air (DAC) could be deployed in parallel. We conduct a comprehensive techno-economic and environmental assessment of a carbon capture plant retrofitted on-board a cargo ship. While the concept was first proposed by Det Norske Veritas and Process Systems Enterprise in 2013 and recently  evaluated by Feenstra and co-workers (Feenstra, 2019 ), its absolute environmental footprint remains unclear. Additionally, we compare this solution with the current business-as-usual scenario (BAU) and DAC as an alternative emissions abatement technology. In this work, life cycle assessment (LCA)-based absolute sustainability methods quantify impacts relative to the planet's carrying capacities using environmental thresholds to interpret the results on a global scale. These methods are rooted in the planetary boundaries (PBs) concept introduced in the work by Rockström et al. (2009) , where for the first time, a set of Earth system biophysical limits that should never be surpassed to operate our planet safely were defined. Later, Sala and co-authors (2020) built on the existing literature connecting 16 indicators of the Environmental Footprint (EF) method to five Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which is the approach followed here and the focus of this work.  2 Methodology 2.1 Reference ship We consider an 8500 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) cargo ship powered by a standard internal combustion engine with heavy fuel oil. The reference vessel travels fixed routes and distances between commercial ports at an assumed speed of 26.5 knots. We retrofit a standard carbon capture process on-board the reference ship to reduce the direct emissions considering a week-long trip. We perform a detailed modeling of the system in Aspen HYSYS v11, which includes three main sections, namely the exhaust gas cleaning, CO2  capture and its liquefaction, as displayed in Figure 1  , that are heat-integrated. The pre-treatment section includes a scrubber for the removal of nitrogen and sulfur oxides from the combustion of the heavy fuel oil, as well as a particulate matter abatement technology to comply with the current regulations. We retrofit a standard post-combustion carbon capture plant on the vessel. Among all the available options, absorption-based CO2  capture is characterized by the highest technology readiness level, which leads to an easy installation on-board and high efficiency. However, this solution comes at the expenses of considerable space reduction on-board mainly allocated to the absorption and desorption column and the natural gas furnace needed to supply heat to the desorber reboiler. Alternative technologies for CO2  capture might be considered to overcome these challenges; however, their assessment is not included in this work. The exhaust gas coming out from the cleaning section is put in counter-current contact with a 30 % wt. monoethanolamine aqueous solution that absorbs the CO2  and leaves  from the bottom of the first column. The clean gas containing less than 1 % mol. CO2  is vented to the atmosphere. The CO2  absorbed by the solvent is stripped in the second column employing heat supplied by the furnace and it is sent to the liquefaction section. Here, it is cooled with natural gas and an ammonia refrigeration cycle to storage conditions (22.0 bar and −16.6 °C) in commercial tanks until it can be unloaded at the port and transported to storage sites via pipelines. We note that the emissions of the furnace are combined with the exhaust gas, so the plant on-board captures the net CO2  emissions of the system. Further details about the techno-economic analysis summarized in the sections below can be found in Negri et al. (2022)  where we report capital and operating costs of the capture plant, as well as a full LCA study based on Rockström et al. PBs.  2.2 Feasibility study Firstly, we assess the technical feasibility of the configuration proposed to ensure that there is enough space on-board to retrofit the capture plant. In this step, we determine the weight and volume of each piece of equipment required on-board in addition to the ones already usually present on vessels, which are not accounted for. Then, we relate this information to the cargo displaced by the plant. Lastly, we calculate the number of extra ships that will be required to transport the cargo displaced in order to keep the total weight of the ship unchanged.  2.3 Economic assessment The economic assessment is performed in accordance with the correlations in Towler and Sinnot for chemical plants (Towler, 2013 ), given the large scale of the equipment installed. We calculate the cost of each unit, considering installation and material factors, for the reference year 2019. The electricity required to drive pumps and compressors is given by the generator, while freshwater is supplied directly from the sea using a desalinator at no additional cost.  2.4 Absolute environmental assessment We perform an absolute environmental sustainability assessment following the four phases of the LCA methodology where we quantify the total impact of the system on 16 LCA metrics based on the Environmental Footprint (European Commission, 2013 ) and updated LANCA (Bos et al., 2018  and Laurentiis et al., 2019 ) methods connected to the nine PBs and five SDGs. Then, we compare the environmental performance to the threshold values reported by Sala et al., where we updated the human health-related effects according to the population of 2019. The functional unit of the study is the global annual cargo demand (36 trillion tkm in 2019) with a well-to-propulsion scope. The life cycle inventory (LCI) phase is carried out in SimaPro v.9.2.0.2, combining data of the foreground from the process simulation and background system from the Ecoinvent v3.5 database. During the last LCA phase, where the results are interpreted, we analyze the relative impacts of the system in the full safe operating space (SOS %). Therefore, an impact above 100 % implies a transgression of the corresponding PB. By using the full SOS, we avoid allocating a share of the PBs to the container ships industry, which is often a controversial step. The life cycle impacts are calculated for each flow i  (impk ), based on the characterization factors (CFsik ) of each elementary flow (Ei ) with respect to k PBs categories. The impact is then compared to the threshold values reported in Sala et al. (PBk ) to determine the transgression level (tlk ) according to Eq. (1) .

The plant designed has an overall efficiency of 94 %, with a total cost of 85 $2019 /tCO2  captured, without considering the capital expenses for the construction of the additional vessels. Given its lower technology maturity level and the low concentration of CO2  in the air, DAC is still a more expensive option with estimates at 300-600 $/tCO2  captured (Fuss et al., 2018  and DAC, 2021 ).  The total equipment required on-board displaces 7 % of the cargo on a mass-basis for a week-long trip, which implies an increase of 3 % in the current fleet to fulfill the annual cargo demand of 2019. The CO2  captured during the trip is stored on-board until the vessel has reached the port, where it is unloaded and transported to saline aquifers storage sites. We assess the environmental performance of the system with respect to the full SOS and we note that none of the categories is transgressed (Figure 3  ). The impact on climate change [kg CO2-eq ] is reduced by 50 % in the capture on-board compared to BAU, while DAC reduces it by 45 % due to the capture of direct CO2  emissions in both scenarios. Although the two alternatives to the BAU contribute to mitigating climate change, significant burden-shifting occurs in the other categories. Eutrophication freshwater, marine and terrestrial are the most affected by burden shifting, where capture on-board performs significantly worse than DAC in the last two. Resource use energy carriers, and minerals and metals also increase compared to BAU, in particular in the DAC scenario due to the additional energy inputs required by the capture process. If we considered  downscaling of the SOS to allocate a portion of it to the shipping industry only, e.g., using the sector GVA (3 % of the global GVA in 2010, OECD 2016 ), some of the categories such as respiratory inorganics and resource use energy carriers would show a transgression level above 95 %. On a broader perspective, trade-offs within SDG 3, SDG 13 and 14 appear when trying to reduce climate change. Respiratory inorganics, i.e., particulate matter, is the most impactful category in SDG 3 good health and wellbeing, where capture on-board performs worse than the BAU scenario. SDG 13 climate action benefits from the CO2  emissions reduction, however, resource use energy carriers increases with both capture on-board and DAC. Lastly, SDG 14 life below water is affected by the eutrophication freshwater category, where both capture on-board and DAC perform worse than BAU, with DAC showing the worst performance.  4 Conclusions An interim solution to reduce direct emissions from the cargo shipping industry based on a retrofitted carbon capture plant on-board was proven to be technically feasible, economically competitive and environmentally appealing. The scenario presented is compared to the business as usual where no measures are implemented and direct air capture. The plant achieves 94% net capture efficiency displacing 7% of the cargo on a mass-basis, which is transported by additional ships corresponding to a 3% increase in the current fleet in 2019. The cost of capture is 85 $2019 /tCO2 , which is considerably cheaper than removing the same amount of CO2  from the air using direct air capture technologies. The absolute environmental assessment reveals that none of the categories is transgressed compared to the full safe operating space. While capture on-board reduces climate change  by 50% compared to the business-as-usual, direct air capture achieves a 45 % reduction. However, burden-shifting occurs in all the other categories in both scenarios, although the scenarios assessed occupy only a small percentage of the full safe operating space. In particular, capture on-board performs the worst in eutrophication marine and terrestrial. The resource use categories are also exacerbated compared to the current scenario, particularly using direct air capture. In order to implement this solution, social and political barriers still exist regarding abatement technologies and should be overcome by putting legal frameworks in place. Additionally, the capital expenses faced by the shipping industry to retrofit the plant on-board and build new vessels that satisfy the demand should be supported by public incentives.
