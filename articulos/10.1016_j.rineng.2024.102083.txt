                  Petroleum hydrocarbon-induced environmental degradation has escalated, necessitating immediate remediation due to the ongoing growth of communities and modernization of civilization. Both carbon and energy can be obtained from hydrocarbons of petroleum, which are decomposed by a wide variety of microorganisms found in nature. Many times, remediation of places damaged by oil using biological means is accomplished by using bacteria that have such characteristics. Hence, this review attempt to highlight on the oil contaminated soil, source of oil pollution, the composition of oil, the impact of oil contamination on the living organisms additionally, the destiny of oil in the environment, how bacteria distributed in the soil and the most common degradable bacteria and their role in oil biodegradation with some attention on the impact of their enzymes. Also, considering the mechanism of biodegradation of aliphatic and aromatic oil hydrocarbon compounds, how bacteria taking up oil hydrocarbons and the influence of several elements on the processes of oil biodegradation. Furthermore, it; reducing pollution contributes to achieving sustainable development goals.

Table 3    No. Factors Process of biodegradation   1 Nutrient Nutrients are required to obtain the microbial use of hydrocarbons to stimulate the activity and growth of bacteria [152 ]. One of the most important of these nutrients that must be provided is carbon in addition to other nutrients that bacteria need of phosphorus and nitrogen, to effectively decompose hydrocarbons. The oil spill often causes nutrients to be closed and inaccessible to bacteria and is required in order to generate the precursors for new microbial cells, in addition to backing the appropriate performance of all structural and metabolic processes of cells. Koshlaf and Ball (2017); noted that the existence of nutrients like phosphorous and nitrogen in excessive quantities in the soil can negatively affects the biodegradability of hydrocarbons, which leads to the inhibition of the decomposition activity of hydrocarbons by bacteria. Brown et al. (2017) showed that the important control element in soil hydrocarbon decomposition is the availability of inorganic nutrients, especially phosphorus and nitrogen, which have a significant act in stimulating the rates of biodegradation of hydrocarbons in the soil [153–155 ].  2 Oxygen Level Oxygen is a considerable parameter for breathing the aerobic bacteria that it requires most, while some bacteria do not need oxygen depending on their requirements, which facilitates the rate of biodegradation in a better way. Sihag et al. (2014) indicated that the metabolism of hydrocarbons can be enhanced in most cases by the presence of oxygen, but the biodegradation is carried out in anaerobic and aerobic conditions. In aerobic circumstances, the biodegradation process is faster than in anaerobic conditions [155–157 ].  3 Temperature The temperature is a significant factor in the formation of hydrocarbons and determining the survival of bacteria [158 ]. The increase in temperature increases the solubility of hydrocarbons, as well as reduces the viscosity of the oil, accelerates the spread of hydrophobic pollutants and enhances the rates of hydrocarbon decomposition [159 ]. Conversely, if the temperature decreases, this leads to a delay in the biodegradation process [160 ]. The optimum biodegradation temperature for oil is from 30 to 37 °C for isolated bacteria, and the maximum rate of biodegradation of oil in the soil have been obtained at a temperature ranging from 30 to 40 °C [161–163 ].  4 Ph- Value The pH is one of the important parameter impacting the growth and activity of bacteria in the soil where metabolism is affected as well as the decomposition of pollutants and their removal depending on the degree of pH of the compounds, whether they are alkaline, acidic or neutral [164 ]. Low and high pH values showed an impact on the biodegradation process of petroleum pollutants, even if the change in pH values was a slight change [165 ]. Because some enzymes produced by bacteria to conduct the process of biodegradation act at a specific pH value [166 ]. Al-Hawash et al. (2018) showed the most of the bacterial species prefer growth in alkaline to natural pH [161 ].  5 Salinity Salinity is an important factor for the activity of many neighborhoods. The salinity affects the growth and diversity of microbes, which has a major impact on the biodegradation process [167,168 ]. The high concentrations of salt develop a specific pressure that produce an inappropriate condition for various bacteria owning to the nutrient shutdown and results in reduced availability of organic compounds and a change in osmotic pressure leading to decreased solubility and the occurrence of so-called salting [169 ,170 ]. Gao et al. (2015) referred the decrease in the vital treatment rate to a decrease in microbial respiration [171–173 ]. The presence of sodium chloride with high concentrations in the soil negatively affects the deterioration of the crude oil because it stops the activity of the major enzymes present in the microbial system as well as osmotic shock events in some bacteria, which causes the inhibition of the biological structure of large molecules, plasma dissolution and inhibition of many physiological processes [174 ].

This contribution results from the expanding worldwide need for petroleum as a primary energy source as well as the variety of places where oil is extracted and delivered. In actuality, the anticipated daily demand for crude oil worldwide is currently at 83.1 M barrels, and, it is predicted to reach 106 M barrels (OPEC 2009) in 2030. In order to fulfill this requirement, the petroleum industry's downstream midstream, and upstream sectors are operating more actively, which has resulted in intentional and unintentional oil spills as well as pipeline and tanker leaks that dump crude oil into the ecosystems all over the world. It becomes imperative to eliminate the discharged hydrocarbon in order to prevent any health and environmental risks posed by petroleum compounds. Because of the sup-pression of microbial activity, the process of breaking down organic pollutants in loca-tions that are co-contaminated might be challenging at times. By using petroleum hydro-carbons as a source of energy and carbon, microorganisms have a plays a crucial part in the conversion of petroleum-based hydrocarbons into CO2 . At the present time, there is a significant increment of contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) worldwide, as the routine and spontaneous spills of petroleum-based compounds contaminate the rivers, seas, groundwater, soli as well as air [1 ,2 ]. Owning to the increased dependence on petroleum as a main resource of energy, petroleum hydro-carbons are considered the most significant micro-pollutants in the soil [3 ]. Hall et al. (2013) indicated that petroleum hydrocarbons are veritable and important for modern life, especially crude oil in relation to development and economic growth from energy perspective, it produces and its industrial importance [4 ]. The accumulation of hydrocarbons in the soil causes many serious problems that negatively affect the balance and stability of the ecosystem and may cause harm to animals and humans [5 ]. There are several methods were developed to clean the sites contaminated with hydrocarbons, including incineration of hydrocarbon pollutants, as well as the development of large-scale boring stations [6 ,7 ]. Although the soil treatment period with these methods is short in addition to the need to use huge machines [8 ]. Crude oil occurs naturally and is a complex mixture of nonhydrocarbon compounds and hydrocarbon compounds of appropriate concentration possessing measurable toxicity to living system [9 ]. Adams et al. (2015) explained that the toxicity of petroleum-based products or crude oil varies widely depending on environmental factors, the nature of formation and concentration of compounds, as well as depending on the biological state of bacteria at the time of contamination, which sparked the attention of researcher to study the field of microorganisms and learn about the role of bacteria in reducing the damage caused by soil pollution [10 ,11 ]. Ghosal et al. (2016) showed that the major dis-advantage of soil contaminated with hydrocarbons is the toxic and mutagenic com-pounds such as aromatic substances or polycyclic compounds [12 ]. Biological treatment routes have been developed to eliminate petroleum hydrocarbons from soil by enhancing the microbial efficiency in the micro-pollutants breakdown through the provision of nutrients, moisture and ventilation [13 ,14 ]. Variety of bacteria were examined and identified to biologically break down the hydrocarbons [15 ]. The most important bacterial species that extracted from oil-contaminated soil and proved biodegradation activities of petroleum are Acinetobacter  sp., Flavobacterium , Bacillus  sp., Aeromonas  sp., Micrococcus  sp., Staphylococcus  sp., Vibrio Xanthomonas and Pseudomonas  sp. [16 ]. The specificity of the biodegradation process of petroleum-based hydrocarbons is related to the genetic potential of the biodegradable bacteria for introducing oxygen into the hydrocarbons and generating intermediates which subsequently enter the general metabolic pathway of the energy-generating cell [17 ]. With the presence of carbon sources, the bacteria produce the enzymes responsible for attacking the hydrocarbon molecules, many of which are involved in breaking down the hydrocarbons present in the oil, but the lack of appropriate enzymes will act as a barrier or prevent any attack to complete the biodegradation of the hydrocarbons [18 ]. Among the general of bacteria were studied in terms of developing its susceptibility to biodegradation, are Staphylococcus sp., Mycobacterium sp., Beijerinkia sp., Sphingomonas sp., Terrabacter sp. and Pseudomonas sp [19 ]. Alcanivorax borkumensis is a possible hydrocarbon-degrading bacterium with better enzymatic capabilities for the biodegradation of hydrocarbon-polluted environments, according to Kadri et al., 2018 [20 ]. Many factors, including temperature, bioavailability of diesel, salinity, bacteria species, availability of nutrients, oxygen, and pH, enhance the degradation processes of crude oil. Achieving high removal efficiency is highly desirable, and the ideal conditions for bacteria to survive in the contaminated environment are highly correlated with these factors [21–25 ]. However, the availability of suitable environmental conditions is primarily what determines the right and accurate performance of bacteria in the biological degradation of hydrocarbons [26 ]. As humanity works to clean up contaminated ecosystems, attention to the biodegradation of petroleum pollutants has expanded recently utilizing suitable and sustainable approaches [27 ]. According to Ye et al. (2017), applying biological approaches is the most ecologically safe way to dispose of petroleum pollutants in soil when com-pared to other chemical, mechanical and physical routes [27 ]. Further objectives on petroleum hydrocarbons-contamination and -bioremediation by biological route should focus on reducing the petroleum hydrocarbons at origin by the re-sources conservation and the efficient use and processing of the oil and improving of the efficiency and increasing the quantity of the bacterial species involved in the bioremediation process should be studied via genetic engineering.  2 Oil pollution Oil pollution is one of the main issues nowadays, which generated the interest of many researchers (especially after the major disasters to which the soil was exposed and caused by oil spills or Leak) to study the environmental pollution represented by the presence of oil-derived hydrocarbons [28–30 ]. Sivagamasundari and Jeyakumar (2018) mentioned that oil pollution is one of the most important factors of environmental pollution known today, because it is difficult to control especially in the soil, because of its wide impact on all aspects of life [31 ]. It was considered the main cause of petroleum hydro-carbon contamination is the presence of heavy molecular weight branching in twenty carbon or more atoms. Husain (2008) indicated that these compounds remain for a long time in the soil, because they are highly resistant to degradation due to their low solubility in water [32 ]. The period of petroleum-based hydrocarbons remaining in the soil depends on their concentration, nature, composition and susceptibility to biodegradation which are among the most prominent determinants of the toxicity of these compounds [33 ,34 ]. The long stay in the soil leads to imbalance of the ecosystem [35 ]. Barnier et al. (2014) mentioned that oil pollution affects biological diversity with the decrease in hydrocarbon sources in the soil over time, for this reason soil pollution by oil was considered of pollution [36–38 ]. 2.1 Source of oil pollution The origin of petroleum-based hydrocarbons that enter the ecosystems are among the most important of which are the geological factors represented by the presence of source rocks at suitable depths under the surface of the rich hydrocarbons so the ground temperature is sufficient to form oil from them [39 ]. The presence of dense forests that occupied some places on the surface of the earth and as a result of the factors of erosion, they were covered by ground layers which led to their decomposition and turning them into oil [40 ]. The large increase in oil consumption in the world, especially after the development led to soil pollution with oil as a result of the spills that occur during the routine processes of producing, distributing and refining crude oil [41 ]. Where it is extracted in large quantities from the land and then transferred to different regions through land or sea transport, or by long pipes to different regions [42 ]. The fact that hydrocarbons are the primary energy sources in the various industries of many chemical products and compounds have increased the demand for petroleum products, which has led to a great exposure of the earth at the environmental level to hydrocarbons [43 ]. Hu et al. (2013) pointed out that the increase in pollution is caused by several sources, including manufacturing, extraction, drilling, refining, and transportation, all of which are potential sources of environmental pollution [44 ]. The worrying of environmental scientists, governments and societies worried about the environmental pollution resulting from the oil spill, it has become a very common thing that occurs constantly through the failure and leakage of oil from the transport pipelines [45 ]. Mukred et al. (2008) explained the difference of the oil components in volatility and susceptibility to biodegradation, as some hydrocarbon compounds resist degradation, some of them degrade easily and oth-ers that are not degradable, which increases the risk of their presence in the soil [46 ].  2.2 Composition of oil Petroleum is a dark viscous liquid consisting mainly of a complicated organic constituents consisting of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons in addition to some mineral organic components as shown in Figure (1)   adapted from Ref. [47 ]. Polycyclic aromatic compounds are harmful chemicals consisting of benzene rings (>2.0) incorporated in an angular, cluster, or linear arrangement [48 ,49 ]. Kumar et al., 2011; classify it depending on the number of rings that contain small aromatic compounds and large aromatic compounds, where the latter contains more than six aromatic rings, while the small is composed of six intense aromatic rings and these are more soluble and dissolvable than the large rings. As for aliphatic hydrocarbons, which can be cyclic, branched, linear, saturated or unsaturated [50 ]. Al-Taee et al. (2017) indicated that they are among the basic ingredients of crude oil, alkanes are one of the most abundant and common ingredients in crude oil. Aliphatic hydrocarbons are divided into four groups depending on their molecular weight which are gaseous alkanes, aliphatic hydrocarbons characteristic with high molecular weight consisting of more than 28 carbon atoms, as for 17–28 carbon atoms, they are medium molecular weight. Finally, aliphatic hydrocarbons with low molecular weight containing 8–16 carbon atom [51 ,52 ].   3 Impact of oil pollution on living organisms Oil spills or leaks affect the soil, causing significant damage to ecosystem and living organisms [53–56 ]. Ikuesan (2017) instructed that contamination of the soil with oil leads to sterility of the soil and consequently changes in its composition, its microbiological and physicochemical properties, which cause delayed growth of plants as a result of the loss of soil fertility and its ability to penetrate and retain water [45 ,57 ]. These impacts resulting from the oil spill lead to a decrease in agricultural productivity, which results in negative impacts on people's lives in economic terms [58 ]. It was noted that many human risks are related to the spread of hydrocarbons. For example, it was reported by Tormoehlen et al. (2014) that acute exposure to hydrocarbons generates many diseases including dermatitis, arrhythmia, acidosis and encephalopathy [59 ]. As for what concerns the carcinogenic effects by some types of petroleum hydrocarbons were specific, but it was observed during the studies that it increases in working people associated with petroleum, including liver, stomach, bladder and lung cancer, in addition to noticing some neurological and reproductive effects [60 ,61 ]. Human exposure to them occurs in three ways, such as skin contact, inhalation and others, which constitute a rate ranging between 88 and 98% of pollution methods and this shows that the main source of human exposure to these pollutants is the diet [62 ]. As for the effect of aliphatic hydrocarbons, their presence in the soil results in oily spots that limit the exchange of nutrients and oxygen in the soil [63 ]. It may also affect the human nervous system, causing loss of consciousness, headache, dizziness, temporary limb paralysis, limb numbness and fatigue [65 ,66 ]. Perelo (2010) indicated that applying the optimal treatment to oiled sites will reduce the risks of pollutants [67 ].  4 The environmental fate of oil pollution Microbes may easily break down the hydrocarbon components of petroleum crude oils [66 ], but the degree to which each component can be broken down varies based on its chemical state and structure [67 ]. The biodegradability of petroleum components follows as: asphaltenes < polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons < cyclic alkanes < monoaromatics < low-molecular weight n-alkyl aromatics < branched alkenes < branched alkanes < nalkanes [68 ]. Even though n-alkanes are the most easily broken down, those containing five to ten carbon atoms hinder the majority of hydrocarbon degraders from breaking down because they damage microorganisms' lipid membranes. Petroleum hydrocarbons, upon entry into the environment represented by chemical, physical, a biotic, and biological processes, all of it called by weathering factors through interaction with microorganisms and metabolic pathways [69 ,70 ]. Weathering processes include optical oxidation, dissolution, evaporation, emulsification, dispersion, diffusion and biodegradation. Mishra and Kumar (2015) and Esbaugh et al. (2016) Indicated that the level at which the different hydrocarbon components deteriorate depends largely on weathering factors, as well as their nature and composition [71–73 ]. The biodegradation process is the best among other physical and chemical weathering processes, because the latter is very expensive due to the cost of drilling and transporting pollutants in large quantities outside the site for treatment [74 ]. As for the biodegradation process, it is economic, eco-friendly, effective and appropriate in removing pollutants and cleaning the environment from hydrocarbons. Varjani and Upasani (2016) mentioned that the biodegradation process was considered one of the main weathering processes that depended on the availability of bacteria and its activity in addition to its dependence on the type of hydrocarbons and their components [75 ,76 ]. This process indicates that the pollutants are destroyed, removed, or analyzed into less harmful or harmless substances, because they reduce the migration of oil pollutants, their transmission and spread to non-polluted places [77 ]. Through this process, the risk they pose to the environment is reduced, but without changing the toxicity of pollutants.  5 Bacteria in soil 5.1 Distribution of bacteria in soil Bacteria can easily grow in different environmental conditions, in addition to having a very interesting metabolic capacity that greatly assisted in the widespread distribution of bacteria in the biosphere and this is extremely important to benefit from the nutritional diversity of bacteria in the biological decomposition of pollutants for the purpose of obtaining energy and biomass production in the biodegradation route. Hammad et al. (2015) noted the wide spread of bacteria in the soil which possess the ability to utilize hydrocarbons in soil as sources of energy and carbon, but despite this widespread of bacteria in the soil, the characteristics of the soil are strongly impact the existence nutrients (nitrogen and organic carbon), the microbial communities, soil texture, and pH [81 ]. The ability to biodegrade varies from one environment to another due to the fact that some environments are more sensitive than others for the effects of oil pollution and that these differences are mainly calculated based on the different requirements of the analyzed bacteria [78 ]. Societies exposed to hydrocarbons have become adapted to genetic changes and selective fertilization, which leads to increased levels of bacteria that have the ability to analyze hydrocarbons, as well as increased bacterial plasmids that symbolize hydrocarbon genes [79 ,80 ]. Eventually, the presence of bacteria everywhere is due to their small size in relation to their large surface area and their possession of an active biomass, which is larger than any other group of living organisms, which gives them the ability to compete with other living organisms for dissolved compounds [81–83 ]. Spini et al. (2018) were able to isolate many optional anaerobic, facultative anaerobic and aerobic bacteria in oil spill sites and soil contaminated with hydrocarbons using molecular and culture-based technology. In addition to relying on high and low temperatures, the base and acidic environment, as well as the high concentrations of pressure and salinity [84 ].  5.2 Common biodegradable bacterial species Table 1   , tabulated many bacterial species found in oil-contaminated soil have been studied and discovered (see Table 1 ). The mechanism of microbial degradation and treatment method are summerized in Table 2 . Members of the bacterial community represented significant results in elimination of organic contaminants from environment. According to reports, the hydrocarbons-degrading microorganisms in the petroleum degrading system in the ecosystems and the environmental conditions [93–97 ]. Figure (2)  , adapted from Ref. [98 ]; shows an excellent illustration in the synthesis of bio-surfactants with the aid of microorganisms like specific strains of Bacillus, Pseudomonas and Rhodococcus, species. These micro-surfactants emulsify the hydrocarbons, lowering their surface tension and increasing their bioavailability so that members of microbial communities can easily access them. It is commonly known that bio-surfactant developer is essential to bioremediation procedures.  5.3 Role of bacteria in biodegradation Soil remediation requires the availability of various mechanical and chemical methods that include soil washing, air avoidance, stabilization and hardening, packaging, pumping and treatment technology and other techniques for repairing contaminated sites [99 ]. Despite the multiplicity of techniques for treating pollutants, the process of biodegradation using bacteria is the most effective way to fully mineralize pollutants and eliminate their danger and toxicity. On the other hand, the hydrocarbon decomposition process is a relatively complicated process by bacteria, where it first takes the hydrocarbons and then converts them from inactive molecules to more active molecules through metabolism. Geetha et al. (2013) indicated that hydrocarbons can be decomposed by many microbes such as fungi, bacteria and yeast, though bacteria have the most important role the central role in hydrocarbon decomposition, as shown in Figure (3)  , adapted from Ref. [100 ]. The bacteria have a specialized metabolic capacity to break down the hydrocarbons in the polluted soil into nutrients and organic matter for use as a single source of energy and carbon, in addition to their abundance and great ability to analyze hydrocarbons [101 ]. Ghosal et al. (2016) and Jiao et al. (2016) emphasized the occurrence of the natural decomposition process naturally by bacteria already present in the contaminated environment, in addition to the possibility of using the microbial pollination method to increase the abundance of bacteria and accelerate the process of biodegradation, because the survival of the pollutants or their decomposition depends on the factors available, including growth and presence of bacteria within the polluted area and the extent of the decomposition of petroleum substances, as well as the factors surrounding the polluted area, the availability of nutrients that increase the ability of bacteria to analyze the pollutants present in the soil and other influencing factors [12 ,102 ]. Khan et al. (2018) indicated that the speed and quantity of hydrocarbon compounds in petroleum depend on factors that differ in their proportions, types and nature, and also the degree of toxicity of hydrocarbons has a role in their decomposition [103–106 ]. 5.3.1 The role of bacterial enzymes in biodegradation Bacteria which possesses an enormous ability to analyze oil biologically is considered one of the most prevalent microorganisms prevalent in this field, because it contains various enzyme genes that enabled it to consume and break down oil hydrocarbons dynamically [107 ]. One of these enzyme is catechol 2,3-dioxygenase and alkane hydroxylase such as monooxygenase, which is one of the main enzymes possessed by many species of bacteria that have role in the analysis of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, respectively [108 ,109 ]. In addition to owning bacteria, there are special decomposition enzymes such as hydroxylases and oxygenase [110 ]. Also, the horizontal transfer of genes is one of the main mechanisms in bacteria responsible for improving the biodegradation process of hydrocarbons [111 ]. Kumar et al. (2011) indicated that for bioremediation to be effective, bacteria must attack contaminated hydrocarbons in an enzymatic fashion to dispose of them by converting them into harmless products [106 ,112 ]. Zeyaullah et al. (2009) explained that the decomposition of pollutants enzymatically depends on three things, namely the production of the enzyme in sufficient quantities and the ability of the enzyme to stimulate a reaction to the decomposition and the arrival of the compound to the enzymes, because the ability of bacteria to analyze polluted hydrocarbons depends on the contact of these pollutants with the enzyme or a series of enzymes [113 ].  5.3.2 Mechanism of microbial degradation Figure (4)  , adapted from Ref. [130 ]. Arora et al. (2010) indicated that these oxygenase's enzymes transport oxygen and use with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide or Flavin adenine dinucleotide for oxidation and break down organic compounds through the adhesion of enzyme to these compounds that lead to increased susceptibility to reaction and dissolution in water [118 ,131 ]. Yadav et al. (2018) explain that monooxygenases can work in the biodegradation process as bio-stimulants that have stereotoxic selectivity on different substrates, as well as have high selectivity for the region [74 ,118 ,132 ]. Therefore, it can be used to stimulate various reactions such as the most important of biodegradation and biotransformation of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon compounds [133 ]. The final product of the aliphatic and aromatic compounds decomposition process in aerobic degradation are water and CO2  [134 ].  5.3.3 Aerobic microbial degradation of aromatic hydrocarbon Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are pollutants everywhere in the atmospheres [135 ]. It has a wide spread in the various ecosystems that contribute to the continued existence of these compounds in the environment [136 ]. It is regarded as one of the soil's most hazardous environmental contaminants and its derivatives resulting from incomplete combustion of organic materials from human activities that carry the ability to stay for a long time while resisting degradation [137 ]. The fate of their presence in the environment is directly related to the biological and abiotic processes represented by oxidation, bioaccumulation and degradation by bacteria [138 ]. The biodegradation of aromatic compounds is accomplished by dividing the benzene ring by means of an intracellular enzymatic reaction as shown in Figure (5)  , adapted from Ref. [139 ]. The oxygenase enzyme hydroxylases the aromatic ring to yield acisdihydrodiol that transforms to an intermediate via adehydrogenase [140 ]. The oxygenase enzymes follow meta-cleavage or orthocleavage routes to breakdown the aromatic rings and produce laughter compounds such as catechols which transform later to some intermediates of citric acid cycle [141 ]. Studies have proven that aromatic compounds containing two or three rings are degradable through bacteria, monoxygenase and dioxygenase enzymes that create a cyclic fission which reduces complexity in the catechols and makes them more exposed and easier to be consumed [142 ].  5.3.4 Aerobic microbial degradation of aliphatic hydrocarbon Alkanes are an essential portion of aliphatic crude oil components [143 ]. It is one of the most abundant components in crude oil and is the first compound to decompose [144 ]. In the event of an oil spill, aliphatic alkanes of short-chain generally fly faster than the original petroleum. However, these compounds may also spread to solid surfaces and enter sandy mud sediments, where they continue to exert a toxic effect on the ecosystem [145 ]. Compounds of greater chain lengths (C20–C40) are more stable in soil and do not volatilize easily and difficult to degrade because of their poor water solubility, their biological availability and structure [146 ]. McGenity et al. (2012) showed that the long chain alkanes are completely dissolved in aerobic conditions. Biological degradation of aliphatic hydrocarbons occurs after splitting of the carbon backbone of the pollutants or as a functional substitution take place by electron loss to the molecular oxygen [98 ]. The first steps of the biodegradation process begin with the aid of dioxygenase and monooxygenase enzymes. The process carries out under aerobic circumstances by the introduction of oxygen atom to the terminal or sub-terminal carbon and these aliphatic compounds are converted into primary and secondary alcohol through converging pathways [148 ]. After that, these products enter the peripheral metabolism pathway in the bacterial cell and have an oxidation process through the C–C bonds are broken gradually yielding in smaller components entering via β-oxidation in to the primary metabolism of the bacterial cell.    6 Factors impact bacterial biodegradation Competition between microorganisms over limited carbon sources, as well as their exposure to devoured by predations and primitives, and the occurrence of conflicting interactions between microorganisms these factors all effect on the process of biodegradation of hydrocarbons as showed in details in Table 3  . In addition, the rate of decomposition of hydrocarbons contaminated with the soil depends on the concentration of these pollutants and the amount of catalyst present [149 ]. The microbial strains that prevail in the polluted soil are the ones that have the ability to survive in the presence of these pollutants and use them as a source of metabolism and growth, as it depends on determining the rate of decomposition of the contaminated hydrocarbons in the soil via the number of the organisms analyzed so as to note the occurrence of a low rate of decomposition of hydrocarbons in the event of a decrease in the number of bacteria in the soil. The opposite occurs if there are sufficient numbers of active bacteria and it is possible through a dynamic increase that means pollinating the soil through suitable strains of decomposing pollutants to overcome the deficiency of microbes [150 ,151 ]. numerous factor has significant effect on the microbial bio-degradation as following.  7 Conclusions and future perspective for SDGs Petroleum-based hydrocarbons have negative impacts on human and ecosystems. This review focuses on their impacts on soil where these hydrocarbons polluted the soil resulting in deterioration impact on plant growth and soil productivity, subsequently, their impact reach human health. Therefore, bioremediation of the hydrocarbons contaminated soil is mandatory. Although numerous physical and chemical routes have been investigated, however these routes caused negative consequences as well as not economic. A special focus toward bioremediation is increased owning to the efficiency, applicability, and simplicity of the process. The main factors of the microbial degradation such as pH, temperature, nutrient, oxygen, salinity are discussed in details. However, it can be noted that optimization of these factor yields in high degree of bioremediation. The mechanism of degradation using the targeted bacteria is explained along with the role of the enzymes. Further research on petroleum hydrocarbons-contamination and -bioremediation by biological route should focus on the following perspectives.I. Reducing the petroleum hydrocarbons at origin by the resources conservation and the efficient use and processing of the oil  II. Assessment of the environmental impacts, cytotoxicity of the Petroleum-based hydrocarbons with special focus on the long term.  III. The weathering factors play an important factor on the bioremediation of these hydrocarbons; hence the impact of climate change on the characteristics of these pollutants and their elimination process should be addressed.  IV. Improving of the efficiency and increasing the quantity of the bacterial species involved in the bioremediation process should be studied via genetic engineering.    The United Nations adopted 17 sustainable developments in 2015. These global goals aim to ensure a healthy human life. To protect natural resources and ecosystems from degradation and ensure equality, economic growth, peace and justice for all. Also, considering the mechanism of biodegradation of aliphatic and aromatic oil hydrocarbon compounds, how bacteria taking up oil hydrocarbons and the influence of several elements on the processes of oil biodegradation.
