                  Purpose and setting
                  Infrastructure is a global multi-trillion dollar market presenting many opportunities and risks for sustainable development. This article aims to foster better conceptualisation of the connections and tensions between infrastructure policy and public health in the light of the Sustainable Development Goals, especially ‘good health and wellbeing’ (number 3) and ‘industry, innovation and infrastructure’ (number 9), based on findings from interviews with a purposive sample of senior practicing Australian infrastructure policy makers.
               
                  Principal findings
                  We use an institutional framework to explore the ideas, actors, rules and mandates, and procedures underpinning the inclusion of health in infrastructure policy. Informants defined infrastructure as the construction and provision of services that facilitate economic, environmental and social outcomes. The tendency to default to infrastructure as essential for economic success has fundamental challenges for the SDGs, particularly the politically driven pursuit of ‘mega-project’ legacies, sector-specific siloed governance arrangements, and inadequate conceptualisations of costs and benefits.
               
                  Conclusions
                  Public health and infrastructure policy are mutually re-enforcing given they both concern the public interest with implications for all 17 SDGs. Positioning health and wellbeing as fundamental societal outcomes from infrastructure decisions would go a long way to helping achieve the SDGs.

Keywords Sustainable development goals  Public health  Infrastructure  Policy  Institutions    1 Introduction The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a useful framing to consider the relationship between health and infrastructure [1 ]. There are seventeen separate SDGs [2 ], but they are inter-connected: the pursuit of each of them requires the coherent pursuit of them together. While there will always be a danger of tension or even conflict at times between the different goals [3 ], policy formulation and decision-making to achieve the SDGs requires a holistic and coordinated approach [4 ]. This is important whether the focus is low-income countries or high-income countries. This paper focuses on exploring the potential connections and tensions between pursuing the SDGs, specifically Goal three (‘Good Health and Wellbeing’) and Goal 9 (‘Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure’), within the context of infrastructure policy-making in Australia, with international implications for knowledge and action. Infrastructure is now recognised as a global multi-trillion dollar market, currently estimated at $USD79 trillion [5 ] or 14% of global gross domestic product (GDP) [6 ]. This investment presents many opportunities to contribute towards achieving all seventeen SDGs but also a potential danger, if infrastructure policy and delivery occurs without due consideration of the potential consequences for health and wellbeing. There is an historic close connection between the construction and provision of infrastructure and health. Sewage removal and treatment and the provision of clean water is perhaps the best known positive health impact [7 ]. Transport infrastructure, especially in urban settings, impacts upon walking behaviours, traffic injuries, noise and air quality [8 ]. Infrastructure, especially carbon intensive energy and transport, contribute to climate change and resulting health impacts [9 ]. The rapid rise of communications infrastructure may benefit access to health-related information and services but exacerbate inequalities [10 ]. Crucially, infrastructure also covers basic services including education, health care and social services that are essential for health, wellbeing and equity [11 ]. Despite this evidence and continued calls to influence the determinants of health, little or no public health focussed knowledge exists about infrastructure as a policy sector. Addressing the economic, social, and environmental challenges through the SDGs requires policy coherence  across sectors, whereby actions within one sector do not undermine the policy goals of another [12 ]. In turn this requires understanding the language, governance and procedures that characterise other sectors as an essential step towards effective ‘healthy public policy’ [13 ]. The aim of this article is to better conceptualise the relationship between infrastructure policy and public health against the backdrop of the SDGs. We focus in on data collected during a program of work about land-use planning and health in Australia [14 ]. Australia like other countries is experiencing a massive upsurge in investment in infrastructure, and has important implications for similar high-income contexts and other nations.  2 Methods The need to better conceptualise infrastructure policy for public health came about during a current program of research into land-use planning policy in Australia. Early on in this program, we uncovered that infrastructure planning and delivery is essential for land use planning, but this is poorly understood by those with an interest in connecting public health with the built environment [15 ]. The crucial role of infrastructure for public health has been reinforced across this program [16 ,17 ] that has systematically investigated land use planning policy across Australia via documentary analysis and interviews with around 90 stakeholders. This led us to develop a research project specifically targeted at better conceptualising infrastructure policy making primarily for a public health audience. The new SDGs were published during this time. The connections between the SDGs were obvious to us, and our data provided, we felt, crucial knowledge for progressing the SDGs. We applied established policy analysis techniques used in the broader program - stakeholder interviews and documentary analysis – using an institutional framework [14 ]: ideas  (policy content), actors  (stakeholders and networks), institutional structures  (rules and mandates influencing organisational behaviour and individual perceptions and choices), and procedures  (policy processes) involved in infrastructure policy. Taking this type of institutional lens has been advocated for in the Planning literature [18 ,19 ]. Our intent is here formative given that this is the first, as far as we know, research explicitly taking this institutional lens to unpack infrastructure policy making with a public health focus. 2.1 Data collection 2.1.1 Interviews A mix of purposive and snowball sample of ten senior professionals (see Table 1  ) working in infrastructure policy across Australian jurisdictions (Federal and State) were identified. Participants were experienced in infrastructure policy and planning (collectively over 100 years), and represented a range of points of view. Interviews were semi-structured, took up to an hour and a half, and were conducted with individuals with the exception of one group interview with three informants. We provided an interview guide prior to the interview (see Appendix 1) and conducted the interviews as conversations [20 ], returning only to the questions if points had not been raised toward the end of the interview. We finished recruiting when we felt saturation of findings was achieved to provide a strong, formative, empirical understanding of the infrastructure sector and its potential overlap with public health ideas and action. Ethics approval was provided by the lead author’s institution (number 2016/078).  2.1.2 Documentary analysis To support the interview findings we investigated how health issues were considered in three major infrastructure plans (see Appendices 2,3) developed at Federal and Australian State level (New South Wales and Victoria). Using NVIVO we searched each plan for the word ‘health’ and subsequently documented this content in terms of instances and how the word was used. At the time of our analysis (2016–2017) the three plans, spread across Australian jurisdictions, represented the most current thinking by independent agencies responsible for providing advice to governments.   2.2 Data analysis Interviews were professionally transcribed then initially coded by XX using QSR NVIVO to develop themes against: ‘Actors, structures, ideas, procedures’. XX then worked through the themes asking specific questions adapted from critical realism to better conceptualise the essential characteristics and relations between objects of inquiry [21 ,22 ], in this case infrastructure policy and its relation to public health and the relation of both to achieving the SDGs. Documentary analysis focussed on the use of the term ‘health’ and ‘well-being’, the meaning inferred by the use of the terms, and for additional data that either supported, extended or refuted the interview findings.   3 Results The results are presented according to the constructs of ‘ideas’, ‘actors’, ‘structures’, and finally ‘procedures’. The primary focus is on infrastructure policy-making and health. In the infrastructure plans analysed we found many instances supporting and extending the interview findings, and none refuting these. Crucially however, ‘health’ was minimally mentioned in the three plans; where health was referred to this was mainly in relation to health sector infrastructure, such as hospitals (see Appendix 3).  4 Ideas 4.1 The idea of infrastructure Infrastructure was defined in the interviews in two ways: what it is and what it does. ‘What infrastructure is’ focussed on core functions, broadly categorised under ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ infrastructure. ‘Hard’ infrastructure concerns ‘built’ or ‘physical’ things that are fundamental economic drivers. In Australia these are defined within legislation [40 ] as transport, energy, water and telecommunications. This ‘hard’ focus of ‘built infrastructure’ became the main focus of the interviews and our analysis presented here. This default to hard infrastructure was recognised by participants as occurring due to the connections made between infrastructure planning and economic development. ‘Soft infrastructure’ refers to the complex set of specialised services provided to people through systems such as those of governance, health, education and recreation. Infrastructure was also understood as interconnected given that it responds to, as well as shapes, society and the public realm. This idea of interconnectivity within political and societal conditions presents a core institutional challenge, recognised by all informants, to coordinate across sectors in the face of complexity and politics. Infrastructure was also importantly characterised as existing over the long term and across a ‘cycle’ that involves planning, implementation and delivery, maintenance, repair or upgrading, and responding to new technologies. ‘What infrastructure does’, we were told, is to facilitate core functions of society to achieve economic, social and environmental outcomes . This has implications for public health and the SDGs to which we return throughout. Infrastructure was primarily identified as facilitating ‘society’ and ‘the community’ to achieve economic, social and environmental (known as the triple bottom line) goals defined broadly by one informant as the ‘balanced development of society’  (informant 1). Infrastructure, it was explained, brings costs and benefits that are ultimately felt in the community, and is thus subject to the willingness of the community to pay for them; either out of their own pocket or through more indirect means such as taxation. A biological analogy was made that usefully sums up what infrastructure does:‘[infrastructure is] the endoskeleton of society so without it you actually don't have a functioning body. And so really it provides the physical services required for an economy to be prosperous and for a community to exist.’    (informant 6)  4.2 The idea of public health for infrastructure decisions Informants recognised the importance of health for the infrastructure sector. For instance‘The public health dimension, I would argue, should – it would be, in my view, difficult, if not impossible, to argue that it’s not part of what we’re trying to achieve with our infrastructure planning endeavours. [but] I don’t think we’re effectively debating those sort of issues at the moment as we could be .’   (informant 1) This final sentence is crucial. Public health, broadly defined, was described by most as important but largely invisible, yet to take hold of the imagination of the infrastructure sector(s) and particularly by politicians. This was confirmed by our documentary analysis. Some more direct public health impacts such as safety and environmental health risks from noise and air quality were argued as necessarily considered under regulations. Injury, we were told, has always been a core consideration particularly within transport infrastructure planning. However, a broader holistic perspective on health, particularly the evidence linking the built environment to health and wellbeing, was recognised as not being considered. Informants suggested that if public health issues are to be appropriately valued within infrastructure, policy reform of the planning process was essential. One option would be to ensure that public health considerations were explicitly considered as a clear stage as part of the planning process. Another, perhaps easier option, would be to ensure that at least all of the relevant costs and benefits relating to public health are considered fairly within any cost-benefit analysis (CBA), the current key measure of potential infrastructure impacts that is conducted. Most informants held that public health issues are not given the appropriate weighting in CBA, because they are seen as not being of central concern but as ‘externalities’ or a by-product or spill-over effect. It was felt that work on the quantification, measurement, and valuation of these elements is required so that they are taken into account explicitly in funding decisions made in treasury departments regarding infrastructure investments:‘Without a genuine set of externalities that industry, as in larger government, there's no way you can argue with treasuries. So because we haven't done that, treasuries don't care about these things which means in the business case it's the fastest to the bottom, they want the cheapest project, limited externality consideration, not whole-of-life thinking.’    (Informant 6)   5 Actors: sectoral arrangements The range of actors engaged in infrastructure was explained in terms of differing involvement of public and private sectors at different points in the planning and delivery cycle. Across the cycle there was uniform agreement that ultimately infrastructure is planned for, invested in, developed and regulated as public rather than private enterprises:‘It's not a public  versus private conversation, it's actually a public v public v public conversation. And if you don't respect that you're not going to achieve anything.’    (informant 6) The ‘public’ role in infrastructure governance comes about for several reasons. Overall there are less clear financial returns for private investors than other investment opportunities. Even where infrastructure services or networks are privately owned in the Australian context these are largely through public retirement investment funds, which were viewed as being public not private institutions. The role of the private sector was described as necessary, particularly for delivery of services as shown next, but insufficient. Even when infrastructure is privately run, ultimately the public bears the cost of financing. For instance, while the energy sector in Australia is almost totally privatised, ultimately the public pays for electricity and this cost has political ramifications that require regulation. Government was essentially described as providing the regulatory and strategic environment behind the mix of public and private investment in infrastructure implementation and delivery. There was also recognition that the trend of the past twenty years was for governments to shift towards a private sector, market driven infrastructure delivery model. Notably, however, the private sector mostly – with energy the main exception – enters at the delivery stage, relatively late to consider public health concerns. The rationale for private investment is ultimately to secure ‘the bottom line’ in terms of financial returns. The onus is thus on government to develop regulations that support practices to consider public health in the public interest. The major identified sectoral challenge was to overcome siloed sectors – transport, energy, water etc. Often, once political decisions were made, the technical advice sought about a particular problem in a specific sector, such as transport, defaulted to sector specific technical advice.‘A lot of people are highly skilled in the infrastructure space and they tend to go there looking for solutions to the kind of infrastructure that they specialize in, rather than seeing that infrastructure has much more a role of being a service to try to achieve social, societal objectives .’   (Informant 4) Compounding this problem was that the health sector itself exists in a silo with all informants viewing the health sector as not engaged in infrastructure planning, beyond hospitals.‘The tendency in the health sphere is to be reactionary and responsive. We spend a lot more on treatment than we do on prevention. And therefore you know we don’t have those voices early in the infrastructure planning process .’   (Informant 2)  6 Structures: the politicisation of infrastructure Informants suggested that the politicisation of infrastructure was the crucial structural challenge facing policy and planning. The long lifecycle that infrastructure embodies was noted as driving a political agenda. The current need to invest in maintaining or upgrading critical infrastructure was seen as the principal reason that infrastructure is currently being a ‘more contested space’  (informant 1) in politics. Politicians push for new infrastructure investments, usually stand-alone projects, as potential vote winners. Infrastructure construction, for instance, is often politically linked to increased employment. Lobbying by different interest groups was also recognised as playing a big part in infrastructure politics, where organisations with a stake in a particular type of infrastructure, such as roads or energy, have strong political influence. A politicised process means relevant evidence is often not considered carefully and sufficiently. Most informants identified examples of counter-intuitive decisions to address traffic congestion by emphasising road projects or upgrades despite the evidence that road construction actually increases congestion in the medium term. The politicisation of infrastructure was, therefore, recognised as necessitating the establishment of independent agencies to provide strategic policy advice, based on the best available evidence (which should include public health evidence) to policy makers:We work in a system where politicians are elected and they’re accountable for decisions. And they’re not prepared to give up their decision making because it’s one of the tools they have to achieve their agenda and get re-elected and all of that, and they’re accountable for it….We have a good system but we need to ensure that the decision makers get good advice .’   (Informant 2)  7 Procedures: tensions and standardised processes 7.1 Tension between project by project vs strategic approaches A core ‘ongoing tension’  (informants 6, 8) within the infrastructure sector was countering the politically driven emphasis on often very large and expensive projects.‘You’ve always got this tension, it’s called “project fever”, between people who know this is what they want, this is the project they want and, “We will make sure that the processes give us the answer we want”, and people, on my side of things who are trying to set up these guidelines and structures to make it more difficult to do that .’   (informants 8) This point where politics meets procedures and processes provides important opportunities for public health to inform infrastructure policy making. The main challenge posed by a project-by-project focus was prioritising flagship projects as solutions to larger issues that single projects are not likely to be able to address. The politicisation of infrastructure was explained as occurring where a particular project, for instance a new road, becomes ‘narrowly conceived’  (informant 4) and fails to account for larger problems across the network (or city or region), often coupled with changes in technology, that cannot be solved on a project by project basis. The failure to situate infrastructure investment decisions within their strategic context was proposed by most informants as a crucial challenge for infrastructure policy and planning:So I say fundamentally “stop talking around projects and talk about solutions”. For instance focussing on the network or system improvement is ok, even if there's not a regional plan, but at least they're looking at the net worth .’   (informant 6) In contrast, strategic infrastructure planning, we were told, is necessary to manage the twin conceptual and pragmatic components of making strategic decisions about infrastructure investment. Conceptually this requires deep understanding of the wider existing conditions at regional or city levels. Pragmatically the choice of investment in specific infrastructure initiatives is bounded both by the (mostly public) money available for specific pieces of infrastructure, politics and the actual (or perceived) need for specific investments. Standardised points to consider public health issues in infrastructure policy and planning.  7.2 Standardised points for making the SDG connections between infrastructure and health Opportunities for public health focussed collaboration and evidence occurs at various points across the infrastructure planning and delivery lifecycle. This cycle is accepted as standardised in policy if not in practice. Public health evidence, we were told, can be used to influence early strategic decisions as well as implementation or delivery stages (either maintaining parts of the network or new projects). These range from creating equitable and liveable regions, cities and places, to the health consequences associated with changes to local environments:‘At the level of strategic planning and programs of investment asking, “Do we think the public health outcomes – other things being equal – would be better or worse if we skewed our investment portfolio one way or another?” At the project level – down to individual projects – the public health outcomes will be more tactical but still important; the volume of emissions concentrated at a particular point, a stack on a tunnel, a level of noise and sleep disruption that might exist around a transport corridor, implications for mental health from having communities disrupted .’   (informant 1) The most important procedural points for linking infrastructure to public health were identified as strategic planning, project business cases and procurement, and ratings tools for the delivery of infrastructure, as follows.  7.3 Strategic infrastructure planning Strategic decisions fundamentally concern setting goals and objectives for what a place (city, region etc) should aim to be. This should include a full set of indicators, including public health, that are set as long term strategic targets and objectives at a regional level that encompass existing infrastructure networks at local, city, regional, and national levels. This emphasises decision-making based on societal needs and demands, the public interest, required level of service and what the public is willing to accept and pay for. Crucially, these targets should then be used to inform plans that in turn inform the business case for which project is best suited to address those needs:‘So the [project focussed] business case is the issue but it's actually the need that’s important….it should really be based on long term, 30 year plus strategic regional triple bottom line planning with objectives and targets. Your public health objective sits with those objectives and targets at a regional level, then you would have plans that come out of that, and then they would feed in to the business case .’   (informant 6) The principal challenge for public health put forward at this point of policy making was to better define what public health means at different geographic or spatial scales. Nearly all informants gave the example of how cities in Australia are now driven economically by knowledge rather than manufacturing. Infrastructure, at a city level, needs to respond to this demand while also alleviating the health risks posed by this new economic reality, with equity a crucial consideration:‘Cities, Australian and American cities primarily, have massively underinvested in urban infrastructure, but they've got very strong knowledge sector economies. And so you've got this tension between desirable, denser inner suburbs, and comparative poverty and particularly time poverty that manifests as health poverty as well, on the outsides. And you get the two archetypes. You get the incredibly wealthy investment banker who can hop on his bicycle and come to his well [designed] office, and you get the either back office worker or core services worker, someone who's going to come and drive a bus or clean the streets, or work as a nurse, or a policeman or in the service sector at McDonalds, who's got 2, 2 and a half hour’s commute each way, and they're getting hit with $25 tolls a day. So the role that transportation plays in their life squeezes other stuff out. And we do see worse health outcomes, we see higher obesity rates, we see lower levels of activity, we see poorer nutritional outcomes. They're the outcomes of the way people balance their priorities under those sets of urban pressures. So how can we through infrastructure start to alleviate some of those urban pressures? ’   (informant 7) Strategic planning was also offered as an opportunity for wider input from the public and other stakeholders. This requires some type of deliberative process up front where communities can engage with the various needs and demands driving infrastructure decision-making, the various options and alternatives that could be considered, and importantly from a public health perspective, the various types of evidence that should go into informing decisions.  7.4 Project planning: business cases and procurement The two critical points within the planning of projects were seen as the development of a business case to cost a potential project, and then various procurement processes to define and narrow the core aspects of a particular project investment:‘the business case is more to get traction to actually go out, to allocate funding to get it. And then the procurement criteria, [defines] well what are the outcomes you are after? And so that’s where the health benefits might come in .’   (informant 3) Infrastructure project planning should ideally proceed through a series of standardised stages. Each stage brings in wider regional and local contextual factors surrounding the project, and then work towards specifying, then approving, the design of the project having factored in its varying impacts. Each stage presents the opportunity for public health evidence to fit the various planning and construction requirements at various points in the cycle. However, current practice was described as usually conforming to the already mentioned ‘project fever approach’. This project-focussed solution often means the preferred option for a particular project is set early as the solution – a road over and above multi-modal transport options for instance. Subsequently the business case developed to cost that project is narrowly focussed on the single ‘asset’, and an assessment of its narrowly conceived financial costs and benefits. Where decisions are bounded within specific projects rather than their strategic context, informants suggested risks very large cost blow outs:‘…because people are pushing for projects, we're not looking at whether that project is going to actually be the ultimate solution. Also that's why we blow things out of the water financially because projects cost a lot because they're steel and concrete, but if you continue to look at system optimisation you might come up with a whole series of smaller projects that might deliver the same outcome .’   (informant 6)  7.5 Ratings tools for infrastructure implementation and delivery Once projects had been approved, at the delivery point in the cycle, several informants suggested that ‘ratings tools’ existed and were being further developed that provide ‘credits’ for projects that are delivered or implemented in a sustainable way. These tools were described as including a comprehensive range of externalities to integrate into project construction to encourage environmentally sustainable practice.   8 Discussion Our findings conceptualise how infrastructure policy and public health cohere in terms of policy ideas and sectors, with implications for achieving the SDGs. By taking an institutionalist approach we have identified core aspects of infrastructure policy and infrastructure as a sector that will have to be taken into account in fostering policy coherence if SDG 3 (‘Good Health and Wellbeing’) is not to be sacrificed in the pursuit of a ‘hard’ interpretation of SDG 9 (‘Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure’) [4 ]. Our findings demonstrate how the policy goals of public health and infrastructure are mutually re-enforcing given they both fundamentally concern, within wider political and societal conditions, the public interest and public good. Further, reinforcing the holistic nature of the SDGs, achieving public health goals through infrastructure policy has clear connections to most if not all the SDGs, from ending poverty (SDG1), through clean water (SDG6) and energy (SDG7), to sustainable cities (SDG11), responsible consumption (SDG12), to strong and just institutions (SDG16) and partnerships to achieve the goals (SDG17). Crucially, the interconnected nature of infrastructure policy for the SDGs is contingent upon political decisions and societal conditions that are driven by the wants and needs of the public. Positioning public health, broadly as both health and wellbeing, as a fundamental societal outcome from infrastructure decisions is the biggest hurdle. From this core finding, here we situate our findings in the wider literature to add depth and breadth for a global audience with an interest in progressing the integrated and coherent pursuit of these two SDGs as the global increase in investments in infrastructure further shape the planet. Our analysis suggests that in Australian infrastructure policy there is currently little attempt to ensure that the sector as a whole offers ‘coherence’ [12 ]. The politically driven tendency to generate ‘mega-projects’ at the expense of (re)-investing in infrastructure networks means that even within the scope of SDG 9 the focus is a narrow one. There is little obvious awareness of the consequences of this even for ‘soft’ infrastructure (e.g. the impact on the health system from poorer health outcomes as a consequence of ‘project fever’), never mind the consequences for more general health and well-being covered by SDG 3. The need for integration and coordination of land use and different types of infrastructure project planning is understood in the Planning literature [23 ,24 ]). However, traditionally infrastructure project investments politically trump strategic land use planning - for instance in Australia [25 ] - a perennial dilemma internationally labelled ‘Planning’s Bete Noire’ [26 ]. An answer to this dilemma, our findings suggest, supports coordinated strategic level infrastructure planning in the public interest [27 ] given that the public ultimately pays for and experiences the impact of infrastructure planning. Further, this rationale for coordinating infrastructure with land use in the public interest is strengthened by the necessary holistic interconnections that are fundamental to achieving the SDGs. Our findings show that infrastructure policy is recognised as enabling positive social, environmental and economic goals. This is supported in the literature, where ‘infrastructure’ is often defined as a facilitator of these societal outcomes [28–30 ]. For instance, ‘[i]nfrastructures are built networks that facilitate the flow of goods, people or ideas and allow for their exchange over space … literally providing the undergirding of modern societies, and they generate the ambient environment for everyday life’ ([29 ] p. 328). However, our data suggest this is not the whole story, as the public health implications of ‘project fever’ are insufficiently considered [16 ,17 ,31 ]. Mega-projects can have both positive and negative impacts upon the health and well-being of individuals and communities. In Australia, reform to the infrastructure policy process is required that will allow for improved project procurement and delivery for the joint enhancement of both SDGs 3 and 9. The ‘official’ aim to achieve so-called balanced triple bottom line (economic, social and environmental) outcomes does not seem to be borne out by our findings. The possible role and place of ‘health and well-being’, we have shown, within the current system is unclear. Our informants often talked about these elements as ‘externalities’, but arguably this is part of the problem. This is an acknowledgment that infrastructure does impact on health, but an ‘externality’ is, by definition, an unintended effect (it is ‘external’ to the intended aim). This use of language seems a tacit acceptance that public health (alongside ‘social’) consequences are not taken into account in current policies or decision-making. The absence of public health was also clear when many of the informants talked about CBA, the current dominant means of assessing options for and against a mega-project. Most informants articulated the current narrowness of CBA concerning the range of elements taken into account. There is no reason in principle why public health considerations could not be part of CBA. The CBA process is a framework to identify, measure and value different types of costs and benefits, make explicit any potential trade-offs, and assess overall net societal impact. To conduct CBA, a ‘societal perspective’ should be adopted, meaning that all major costs and benefits should be included. However, in practice, many CBAs have excluded major impacts, such as health. If relevant factors are not included, it is no surprise that they are not part of the decision-making. Further, the practice of CBA rarely accounts for how impacts are distributed in the population but rather focusses on net outcomes. This raises concerns regarding inequality and differential impacts on different population groups. Ultimately the challenge facing the implementation of CBA is normative, concerning ‘whose values’ and ‘whose preferences’ are used to account for and value impacts. There is an opportunity and need to make explicit and value the differential impacts of projects. This can be achieved through the development of numerical weights that could, for instance, give higher weight (higher value) to the preferences of or impact upon disadvantage groups. The development, validation, and use of numerical weights requires working with economists, ethicists and decision-makers to help ensure that the values structuring the process are legitimate, incorporate equity considerations explicitly, and help align sector decision-making with the overall aim of improving societal outcomes. Turning to policy making more broadly, in Australia there has been a tendency toward what political scientists term ‘path dependency’ (where politics supports the status quo over a long period rather than new ideas) particularly concerning the dominance of roads for cars [32 ,33 ] but also reliance on fossil fuels for energy. In Australia and elsewhere the community have tended to distrust a government-led economically driven agenda [33 ,34 ]. Given that costs for infrastructure are, we were told, ultimately borne out in the community, ensuring the community engage with the need for particular infrastructure responses to particular societal problems (i.e. cost of energy, population growth, aging transport network) is a crucial part breaking that path dependence and encouraging political accountability. Understanding infrastructure requires acknowledging systems, long time periods, and complexity [24 ,29 ,30 ,35 ]. The literature supports our finding that infrastructure is easily politicised because, particularly at certain points in its lifecycle where infrastructure is required to be invested in as it begins to fail or not keep up with demand, it becomes visible to the wider community [29 ,35 ,36 ]. This, we have shown, is crucial to the public health and SDG agendas as it provides the opportunity to actively engage to counter that politicisation of infrastructure policy and planning with good ideas, evidence, and supportive collaboration. Our emphasis on practices and institutions opens up an applied research agenda somewhat akin to the OECD’s [12 ] work on SDG policy coherence for sustainable development, where the emphasis is on the whole policy system. However, our findings suggest that in countries like Australia there is a standardised set of infrastructure practices that can, and should, centre around critical questions about the inclusion of neglected public health issues. Research can investigate infrastructure policies and planning to see how well health and well-being are covered, both explicitly and implicitly, and various standardised junctures: policies and regional or city plans, business cases and related decisions, options appraisal and cost benefit analyses, and environmental impact assessments and impact statements. Behind this technical focus on the framing of health and the quality of that inclusion lie broader institutional questions about governance, power, purpose, resources, risks and so forth [16 ,37 ]. This broader analysis will allow the development and evaluation of public health focussed interventions at multiple points in the infrastructure policy and planning system. This type of applied research is possible in countries like Australia where there are embedded, standardised infrastructure planning practices. The EU for instance is experiencing a massive injection of funds into infrastructure predicted to grown to €500 bn by 2020 [38 ]. In other countries, for example some lower and middle income countries with limited institutional opportunities for standardised planning procedures, engaging with industry at an early and strategic point before project by project decisions are made is important [39 ]. There are some limitations to our research. Our sample was small, corresponding to the fairly limited current policy interest in the links between infrastructure and health. However, many of the points raised in our analysis presented here have been discussed across our larger program of work that is similarly institutionally focussed and draws on a larger (<90) sample of informants working across strategic land use planning as well as transport and mining projects [14 ]. Our Australian focus is also a limitation, and there are some important contextual nuances (e.g. [33 ]), especially for a global audience. That said, Australia is experiencing a massive upsurge in infrastructure investment with globally relevant lessons.  9 Conclusion The policy goals of public health and infrastructure are mutually re-enforcing given that they both fundamentally concern the public interest. Achieving public health goals through infrastructure policy has clear connections to most if not all the SDGs. The principal challenge for including public health issues in infrastructure policy is the tendency of those working in the sector to focus on growth in terms of economic productivity rather than sustainable development. Our data suggests that infrastructure decision-making is an ossified process, one that fails to capture all relevant possible considerations, for instance within the range of options for CBA. Whether some variant of CBA can be developed that provides for public health and equity considerations remains to be seen, but there is no reason, at least in principle, why it cannot be achieved. One possible problem is that the public, when consulted about their preferences, may fail to appreciate the role that infrastructure plays in ensuring that they are able to live flourishing lives in a sustainable manner. Another is that the public health sector voice is currently missing from infrastructure policy discussions (except about hospitals and health services). Mapping out the core dimensions of infrastructure policy practice and how these align with public health and the SDGs, as we have done here, is an essential first step toward encouraging public health to critically engaging in infrastructure policy and practice.
