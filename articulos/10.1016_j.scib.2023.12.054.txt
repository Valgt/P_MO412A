Research Highlight  Accelerate progress towards sustainable development goals: Insights from China Lei Gao  Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Waite Campus, Urrbrae SA 5064, Australia Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Waite Campus Adelaide SA 5064 Australia  Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Waite Campus, Urrbrae SA 5064, Australia    Since the inception of the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda, commonly known as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in 2015, we have now reached the halfway point in this ambitious global initiative. However, progress towards the SDGs has veered significantly off track, partly due to key global changes such as the COVID-19 pandemic [1] , necessitating an immediate acceleration of efforts [2,3]  (as shown in Fig. 1  a). While the SDGs represent a global consensus, the substantial work required to achieve them needs to be carried out at the national, regional, and local scales, where concrete and feasible actions must be taken to accelerate the SDG achievement within the 2030 timeline. This underscores the urgent need for science-driven transformations to fully achieve SDGs in the remaining seven years. Regrettably, the information necessary to support these transformations is still lacking, highlighting the pressing requirement for corresponding research endeavors. These endeavors should encompass gaining a comprehensive understanding of the current status of SDG implementations across varying scales, identifying the bottlenecks that hinder progress, setting priorities for implementation, and exploring pathways to expedite progress. In response to the pressing requirement, recent work [4–6]  published in Science Bulletin  has showcased assessments and proposed acceleration pathways addressing diverse scales and various SDGs (as summarized in Fig. 1 b). Poverty eradication stands as the foremost priority among the SDGs. However, regrettably, without proactive and effective changes, the world is deviating from the objective of “leaving no one behind” with nearly one billion people still trapped in extreme poverty. Poverty serves as both the root cause and a consequential outcome of land degradation in various regions worldwide. This complex relationship often intertwines poverty with environmental degradation, making the sustainable development of poverty-stricken areas (PSAs) as a significant global challenge. Therefore, it is crucial to acknowledge that poverty reduction measures can sometimes have unintended consequences on other SDGs, particularly those linked to environmental pressures [7,8] . Hence, there is an urgent global need to find pathways that harmonize poverty alleviation with environmental conservation. To address the need, led by Yong Ge from the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, a research team undertook a quantitative assessment of progress towards SDG 1 (poverty eradication) and explored the symbiotic relationships between SDG 1 and environment-associated SDGs within China’s PSAs [4] . The team devised a comprehensive county-level index system that encompassed both socioeconomic and environmental sectors in China’s PSAs, and revealed the spatial–temporal socioeconomic and environmental patterns. Furthermore, they calculated coupling coordination degree (CCD) as a critical tool to assess the symbiotic relationships between these two sectors. Ge et al. [4]  uncovered a consistent improvement in the harmonious development of socioeconomic and environmental conditions in China’s PSAs from 2000 to 2020. The socioeconomic index experienced a significant surge, with a remarkable rate of 58.4%, while the environmental index also saw a mild improvement, recording a growth rate of 19.6%, contrary to a reduction. Despite these improvements, impoverished areas still lag behind in socio-economic development when compared to more prosperous regions. However, these economically disadvantaged areas outperform their counterparts in terms of the environmental index. In an effort to offer viable pathways for the global community to accelerate the achievement of multiple SDGs by addressing the trade-offs between poverty reduction and environmental conservation, this research has identified four distinct poverty reduction models based on the patterns of CCD change. These models encompass advantageous, sustained, periodic, and limited effective models, each offering insight into nuanced poverty alleviation strategies customized to the unique features of diverse regions. These typical regions include areas characterized by extensive forest coverage yet isolated by massive mountain ranges, the arid and semi-arid zones of the Loess Plateau, the culturally diverse border and ethnic areas in southwestern China, and the expansive desert and Gobi-covered southern Xinjiang. Each of these models serves as a testament to the adaptability and resilience of poverty reduction efforts when confronted with the intricacies of geographical and cultural diversity. In 2011, China identified fourteen key PSAs, covering approximately one-third of its land, and implemented a comprehensive suite of poverty reduction measures within these PSAs [9] . These efforts to alleviate poverty led to significant improvements in infrastructure, including enhancements to rural road networks, the provision of essential public services, and a notable increase in the living standards of residents. The research led by Ge et al. [4]  has made a valuable contribution by quantitatively assessing the symbiotic relationship between SDG 1 and the SDGs related to environmental pressures. This assessment was conducted within the context of the poverty alleviation measures that had been consistently implemented over the years. The research team has also effectively delineated the strategies employed by China to address the challenge of reconciling the achievement of SDG 1 with that of the broader SDGs associated with environmental pressures. This research offers valuable pathways to guide the global community in achieving the SDGs related to poverty eradication and environmental conservation. Land-use change is closely linked to numerous SDGs (such as SDGs 1, 2, 6, and 11–16). Sustainable land use practices are essential for achieving multiple goals related to environmental conservation, climate action, and poverty reduction [10] . Cao et al. [5]  proposed a new research methodology to project future land-use demands up to 2030 in countries along the Silk Road through setting scenarios that meet specific SDGs and employing models that integrate system dynamics and cellular automata. The study is a new attempt to scientifically achieve the SDGs by understanding how the achievement of a specific SDG drives future land-use change, as well as understanding synergy and trade-offs between multiple SDGs. Cao et al. [5]  defined four scenarios, each representing a unique future shaped by the achievement of specific SDGs: Sustainable economy (ECO), sustainable grain (GRA), sustainable environment (ENV), and reference (REF). The projections of land-use changes along the Silk Road presented noteworthy variations in future land transformations and carbon stocks across the four SDG scenarios by 2030. Notably, the ENV scenario witnessed a transition in China’s forest area from negative growth to a net increase, leading to a 0.6% rise in forest carbon stock in China by 2030, compared to the level in 2020. Within the GRA scenario, the decreasing rate of cultivated land area slowed down. Cultivated land area in South and Southeast Asia showed an upward trend in the GRA scenario, while displaying a decreasing trend in other SDG scenarios. Remarkably, the ECO scenario recorded the highest carbon losses, primarily attributed to increased urban expansion. This study significantly enriches our understanding of the impacts on the achievement of other SDGs resulting from the achievement of specific SDGs, providing a scientific reference for how to simultaneously accelerate the achievement of multiple SDGs. Regions with unique characteristics play a pivotal role in attaining the SDGs. For example, endorheic regions often host unique and diverse ecosystems, which are vital for achieving SDG 15 (Life on Land). These regions, frequently characterized by limited water resources, underscore the importance of sustainable water management in contributing to SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation). Some endorheic regions are agriculturally productive areas where sustainable agricultural practices are essential for achieving SDG 2 (Zero Hunger). In addition, the combination of the burgeoning population, rapid urbanization and a warming climate poses new challenges in the SDG achievement within endorheic basins. Ge et al. [6]  identified the determinants that dominate sustainability in endorheic regions and delineated potential pathways to achieve multiple SDGs. They achieved this by simulating the impacts of 2160 combinations of six driving and telecoupling factors (i.e., temperature, precipitation, technological level, population growth rate, urbanization rate, and ecological water flow) on the trade-offs among diverse SDGs in a typical endorheic basin [6] . The analysis of the 2160 projected pathways revealed that sustainability in endorheic basins is essentially dominated by the coactions of the six factors, rather than any “silo” factor. In terms of individual impact, technological advancements emerge as the most influential factor influencing sustainability, followed by urbanization, temperature, and population growth. The coaction of both technological advancements and ecological water flow was the major determinant for sustainability transformation. The authors suggested that achieving SDGs in endorheic regions necessitates a higher level of integration. This entails conducting co-analyses of multiple driving forces, exploring the interconnected nexus of water, food, ecology, and socio-economics, and establishing stronger connections between science and policy across the entire basin and among various sectors at different scales. The aforementioned studies employed a range of innovative approaches to explore factors influencing SDG achievement and potential acceleration pathways towards SDGs. To illustrate, Yong Ge’s team [4]  incorporated an entropy weighting method and a grey relational analysis into their assessment of county-level socioeconomic and environmental indices and derived coupling coordination degree between the two types of indices. Cao et al. [5]  developed simulation models that integrated technologies of system dynamics, cellular automata, and machine learning to project future land uses under four SDG achievement assumptions. Ge’s team [6]  developed an integrated framework that combined a surrogate model, a computable general equilibrium model, downscaled SDGs and shared socioeconomic pathways, and a sustainability assessment model. This framework was designed to quantify synergies and trade-offs among SDGs, identify key sustainability drivers, and find pathways for achieving multiple SDGs in endorheic regions. These approaches employed in these studies hold significant potential for application beyond their original contexts, offering adaptability and replicability in diverse local and regional settings. By adapting these approaches to local contexts, policymakers can develop tailored strategies to regional challenges and opportunities in achieving the SDGs. Although these studies employed a variety of methodologies, they all share a reliance on big Earth datasets, underscoring the critical role of such data in enhancing our understanding of SDG-related challenges and opportunities. Big Earth Data sources, including satellite imagery, remote sensing, and geospatial data, are fundamental in tracking SDG progress and facilitating assessments of changes and trends for different SDG indicators. These data provide historical context and reference points against which progress can be gauged. Big Earth Data are valuable to understand the spatial distribution of SDG-related challenges and opportunities, pinpointing geographic areas that require urgent interventions. However, the effective use of Big Earth Data is often hampered by challenges in data availability, quality, and interoperability [11] . Consequently, it is essential for governments to facilitate open access to such data, and to foster collaboration across administrative sectors for transformed data governance and sharing via a dedicated SDG data infrastructure [11,12] . Integrating Big Earth Data with coupled human-natural system models is essential for achieving SDGs [12,13] , enabling a holistic understanding of how progress in one area may catalyse or hinder progress in others, at multiple scales from local to global. Researchers can harness the potential of Big Earth Data to develop new tools, technologies, and approaches aimed at generating actionable insights for accelerating progress toward SDGs. In conclusion, as we stand at the halfway point of the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda, accelerating progress towards the SDGs is paramount. Although the SDGs are globally agreed upon, their achievement depends on concrete actions taken at the national, regional, and local scales. Science-driven transformations are urgently needed to fulfill these goals within the remaining seven years. Recent research efforts published in Science Bulletin  have shed light on diverse assessments and pathway exploration, addressing critical SDGs linked to poverty eradication, sustainable land use, and the unique challenges of endorheic regions. These studies have showcased innovative methodologies and highlighted the pivotal role of Big Earth Data in understanding the challenges and opportunities of accelerating SDG achievement. As we move forward, it is essential to embrace these findings, advocate for further similar endeavours, fully utilize the potential of Big Earth Data, and foster interdisciplinary collaboration. These collective efforts will pave the way for further governance reforms that emphasize differentiation, dynamization, legalization, and stronger institutionalization [14] , which are instrumental in maximizing SDG progress within the next seven years. The actions undertaken today will shape the world we leave for future generations.  Conflict of interest The author declares that he has no conflict of interest.
