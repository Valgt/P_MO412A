                  Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7, one of the 17 SDGs adopted in Sep. 2015, aims at ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. Achieving SDG 7 is crucial for human well-being, economic growth, and achieving the climate change 2 °C goal. In regard to development priorities, sustainable development context, and mutual benefits and co-benefits between the 2 °C goal and SDGs, the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)’s mitigation measures pursuant to the Paris Agreement should be integrated into the implementation plan of SDGs, and comprehensively implemented under the financial, technology transfer, and capacity-building support, in accordance with articles 9, 10, and 11 of the Paris Agreement.

Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7, one of the 17 SDGs adopted in Sep. 2015, aims at ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. Achieving SDG 7 is crucial for human well-being, economic growth, and achieving the climate change 2 °C goal. In regard to development priorities, sustainable development context, and mutual benefits and co-benefits between the 2 °C goal and SDGs, the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)’s mitigation measures pursuant to the Paris Agreement should be integrated into the implementation plan of SDGs, and comprehensively implemented under the financial, technology transfer, and capacity-building support, in accordance with articles 9, 10, and 11 of the Paris Agreement.   Keywords Climate Change  Renewable Energy Resources  Sustainable Development Goal    Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7, one of the 17 SDGs adopted in Sep. 2015, aims at ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all (United Nations, Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP, 2017 ). Achieving SDG 7 is crucial for human well-being, economic growth, and achieving the climate change 2 °C goal. In DPR Korea (the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) as one of the developing countries, achievement of SDG 7 definitely requires financial expenditure, much effort, and time-consuming work. In DPR Korea with long coastlines, there are 2433 rivers/streams with over 5 km in length, which allows the country to have abundant hydropower resources. In addition to hydropower, the country has abundant renewable energy resources: solar, wind, biomass, and ocean waves. Unfortunately there are no crude oil or natural gas resources in the country, but abundant coal resources such as anthracite and lignite. If the renewable energy resources could not be transformed into affordable, sustainable, and clean energy, it would result in accelerating climate change as well as environmental pollution (Merino-Saum et al., 2018 ) because most of industrial sectors and households could rely on coal and firewood for their energy demand. That is just one of key challenges in achieving SDG 7 in DPR Korea. Modern energy service is the first target of SDG 7. According to a report of World Resources Institute, until recently, around 1 billion people did not have electricity globally, and annually over 4 million people died prematurely due to indoor air pollution, mainly among women and children. In DPR Korea, electrification of the whole country was completely carried out in 1970, including towns as well as mountain villages. However, due to aging infrastructure with inefficient technology, the progress of SDG indicator 7.1.1 accounted for 29.6% in 2012 (Table 1  ), lower than the world average of 84.6%. In addition, the progress of indicator 7.1.2 was 6.6% in 2014, which was remarkably lower than the world average of 55.7% (see Table 1 ). The reason behind the considerable differences in the progress of indicators is that most of urban and rural households use polluting and non-modern solid fuels like anthracite, lignite, firewood, and agricultural residues for cooking and heating. According to the socio-economic, demographic and health survey conducted in 2014, household shares with primary reliance on clean fuels like electricity, LPG and central/local heating system for heating and cooking were 12.4% and 12.4% in urban areas, 0.5% and 2.4% in rural areas, respectively. Providing access to clean fuels and technologies to urban and rural households can reduce the use of coal, firewood and agricultural residues that cause indoor air pollution, which is an important cause of morbidity and mortality, primarily for women. By introducing small-scale hydropower and solar PVs widely into rural areas of DPR Korea, the proportion of rural population with access to electricity increased by 39.2% in 2016. For 100% of population with access to electricity by 2030, the national economy needs to be switched to a system with greater efficiency and larger share of electricity generation from renewable energy resources like hydro, solar, wind, and ocean waves. Renewable energy is the second target of SDG 7. Increasing the renewable energy share in energy mix is DPR Korea’s power industry development strategy, which can substantially make contributions to SDG 7 (Carreón and Worrell, 2018 ). In DPR Korea, the progress of indicator 7.2.1 was slightly higher than the world average of 20.1% in 2014 (Table 1 ). It is due to the higher share of hydropower over coal-fired power in electricity generation, and the use of firewood by households especially in rural areas. In fact, DPR Korea still has great potential for exploitation of hydropower resources, particularly in terms of small-scale ones. Moreover, since the exploitation of solar, wind, biomass, and ocean wave resources is just at the beginning, the country has tremendous potential that might increase the renewable energy share in energy mix than the world average. Energy efficiency is the third target of SDG 7. In 2014, the progress of indicator 7.3.1 was 881.4 kgoe/1000 US$, which was 3.7 times as great as the world average (Table 1 ) because domestic coal is responsible for two-thirds of total primary energy supply (O et al., 2019 ). Meanwhile, energy plays a significant role in achieving the 2 °C goal as it accounts for roughly two-thirds of global anthropogenic GHG emissions. Furthermore, in DPR Korea, GHG emissions from the energy sector, the largest emission source, account for most of the total national GHG emissions (O et al., 2019 ). As climate change becomes a challenge of the global commons, every country should participate in the solution. From the global consensus, in Oct. 2016, DPR Korea communicated the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) (Intended Nationally Determined Contribution of Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (INDC, 2016 ) including mitigation measures, which aims at decreasing GHG emissions per capita by unconditionally 6.3tCO2 e and conditionally 4.1tCO2 e by 2030 and will contribute to both the 2 °C goal and SDGs. INDC’s mitigation measures are closely linked to SDG 7, generating mutual benefits and co-benefits, and would also contribute to SDG 3, SDG 8, SDG 9, and SDG 12. In detail, the implementation of conditional measures would contribute to the achievement of all targets of SDG 7 (i.e., 13 to SDG 7.1, 8 to SDG 7.2 and 7 to SDG 7.3, of 15 measures) with achieving the additional contribution equivalent to 32.3% (60,549 GgCO2 e) (Intended Nationally Determined Contribution of Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (INDC, 2016 ) of the total national GHG emission projection by 2030, while the implementation of unconditional measures could somewhat contribute to the achievement of SDG 7 targets, as only 8.0% (14,997 GgCO2 e) (Intended Nationally Determined Contribution of Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (INDC, 2016 ) of the total national GHG emission projection by 2030. As INDC’s mitigation measures aimed to achieve the 2 °C goal, the INDC urgently needs to be updated as the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) pursuant to the Paris Agreement, in regard to development priorities, sustainable development context, and mutual benefits and co-benefits between the 2 °C goal and SDGs. Furthermore, the updated NDC’s mitigation measures should be integrated into the implementation plan of SDGs, and comprehensively implemented under the financial, technology transfer, and capacity-building support, in accordance with articles 9, 10, and 11 of the Paris Agreement.
