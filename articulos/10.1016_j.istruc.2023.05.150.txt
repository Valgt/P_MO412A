Addressing the challenge of providing a reliable and easily accessible power source for active mechanical  components and investigating piezoelectric hip prosthesesâ€™ design and performance. The modified hip implant  incorporates three vibration-based harvesters running in parallel, capturing energy during an average human  stride through angular movements such as flexion, extension, and abduction. Finite element analysis is utilised to  evaluate structural stress failure strength and refine the implant design, ensuring enhanced load transfer to the  piezoelectric element and increased energy generation. The experimental results demonstrate the potential to  harvest up to 55 J/s of helpful power and 1.76 V, contributing to the development of sustainable and reliable  intelligent hip implants that can operate continuously without being disabled and work without risk. This  innovative approach supports advancements in healthcare technology and improved patient outcomes,  emphasising the importance of sustainable and accessible solutions in the orthopaedic field. Future research will  delve into energy conversion and fatigue in complete hip implant designs, further promoting health, well-being,  and sustainability in healthcare solutions.    1. Introduction  Surgical revision remains the primary treatment for most total joint  replacement failures. While antimicrobial medication, suppressive  antibiotic therapy, outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy, and  antibiotic prophylaxis can delay common replacement failure, they  cannot prevent it [1â€“3]. These surgical revisions alleviate pain and  enhance joint function but fail to address or prevent early shortcomings.  Improving prosthesis functionality often necessitates exploring innova- tive designs, materials, attachment methods, and surgical procedures  [4â€“6], aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal  (SDG) 3: Good Health and Well-being. With an increasing global pop- ulation and technological advances, there is a growing demand for  primary and revision joint replacements. The revision rate for ortho- paedic prostheses after 20 years remains over 20% [7,8], emphasising  the need for durable prostheses for people under 65 who are hospitalised  for joint disorders [9,10]. This highlights the importance of investing in  research and development to support SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and  Infrastructure. Current hip prostheses are passive, and while instru- mented prostheses introduced in the 1960s have helped improve passive  implants, surgical operations, preclinical testing, and physiotherapy  programs, they still lack a reliable method to generate power [11â€“23].  Developing innovative hip implant circuitry that efficiently manages  power and harnesses energy from a personâ€™s movements to power  intelligent hip prostheses could contribute to SDG 7: Affordable and  Clean Energy.  As the worldâ€™s population continues to grow and younger individuals  receive implants, the incidence of failing implants will increase pro- portionally to original arthroplasties [24â€“26]. This emphasises the need  for novel treatments and technologies in the future, which could help  address deficiencies and expand the range of available treatments.  Diagnostic sensors can track implant stability, loosening, or wear to  * Corresponding author at: School of Science and Engineering, University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom.

In contrast, active sensors can promote bone  formation and implant life [27â€“29]. Such advancements align with SDG  3: Good Health and Well-being by reducing the need for invasive, costly,  and potentially life-altering revision surgeries, and SDG 9: Industry,  Innovation, and Infrastructure by promoting technological progress in  orthopaedic implants. Active sensors, such as electrical stimulation,  have the potential to stimulate bone formation and extend implant life.  Optimal power supplies are crucial for these sensors and actuators. Data  and electricity have been transmitted through the infected percutane- ously, allowing for wireless measurements through telemetry and bat- teries [30â€“32]. However, batteries have limitations, such as a short  lifespan and leakage issues. Inductive coupling can address these chal- lenges but is limited to clinical or laboratory settings due to the need for  external equipment. Energy harvesting offers a promising solution,  aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)  7: Affordable and Clean Energy [33,34]. Using energy harvesting,  instrumented implants can generate their power source, eliminating the  need for replacements and ensuring continuous operation. Implant loads  can be transmitted to a multilayer piezoelectric element through the hip  implant and UHMW-PE housing [35â€“37], creating a self-powered sensor  that generates electricity during physical activity. This research aims to  develop and test a prototype device that uses vibration analysis to assess  implant stability, which is expected to be more user-friendly, compact,  and cost-effective for clinical applications. This aligns with SDG 9: In- dustry, Innovation, and Infrastructure.  Additionally, this study proposes installing piezoelectric devices in  mechanically loaded areas to produce electricity, which requires careful  placement to minimise the impact on the hip implantâ€™s cross-sectional  area and forces, thereby preserving the implantâ€™s longevity. By exam- ining the safety of a mechanically stressed metal hip implant compo- nent, this research contributes to SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being.  Using finite element analysis (FEA) and load testing, this study also aims  to determine a PLA hip implantâ€™s worst-case structural fatigue failure  strength, which will provide valuable insights into implant design  improvement. By surpassing the ISO requirement and conducting  further FEA to understand stress distribution, this research supports SDG  9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure by promoting technological  progress in orthopaedic implants. Ultimately, these advancements will  contribute to better patient outcomes, reduced healthcare costs, and  improved overall well-being, aligning with SDG 3: Good Health and  Well-being.  2. Methodology  In this study, we aimed to develop a new hip implant using sus- tainable materials and innovative design principles, aligning with the  United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 9: Industry,  Innovation, and Infrastructure. We 3D printed the hip implant with  filament purchased from ZHUHAI JIAWEI IMPORT AND EXPORT  TRADING CO LTD. We selected the V40 PLA offset head with an 8-mm  offset and mounted a linear strain gauge to the hip implant chamberâ€™s  side for Finite Element Analysis (FEA) validation. We utilised a template  to adjust the sensorâ€™s centre and measurement direction axis, ensuring a  consistent strain gauge installation that worked with the FE model. The  simulation results met the requirements for an evenly loaded region and  a location near the target zone. However, the curved shape of the hollow  baseâ€™s projected stress concentration proved unsuitable for strain  gauges. We followed the ISO standard 7206â€“4 for testing and aligned  three hip implant specimens using an aligning fixture of 9â—¦ to 10â—¦. We  positioned the sample before electrodynamic uniaxial testing equipment  with a 5 kN load cell and soft springs that maintained a ball ring between  the head and the piezoelectric materials to prevent side forces. During a  quasi-static experiment, we gradually increased the load to 2300 N in 10  stages and monitored stresses using a strain gauge. We applied each load  level thrice for 5 s and calculated the average strain for each location.  We tested three samples with a maximum sinusoidal load of 2300 N, R = 0.1, 10 Hz, and million cycles. After five million cycles, we increased the  load by 300 N per million cycles (R = 0.1) until failure. We removed the  sample from the machine after 5 million cycles to allow the ball ring to  return.

By investigating this new  hip implantâ€™s structural properties and fatigue failure strength, we  contribute to SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being by promoting ad- vancements in orthopaedic implants that improve patient outcomes,  reduce healthcare costs, and enhance overall well-being. Our innovative  approach to hip implant development and testing supports SDG 9: In- dustry, Innovation, and Infrastructure by fostering progress in ortho- paedic implant technologies.  In this study, we aimed to develop a patient-specific PLA 3D-printed  hip implant by using a commercially available hip implant as a starting  point. The revised design allowed for the integration of electronics  without compromising the structural integrity of the device. This inno- vation aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal  (SDG) 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure. We relocated the  control unit to a cassette incorporated into the overall design, using a 3 V  lithium coin battery to power the ultra-low-power 2.4 GHz RF trans- ceiver. We monitored the implant using an external accelerometer  comprising an additional RF chip and a microcontroller. The micro- controller received data from sensors connected to a Serial Peripheral  Interface via Bluetooth. To test the communication technology in a  realistic environment, we wirelessly collected data from a distance of 2  m. Fig. 2 depicts the 3D-printed model and enclosure for the monitoring  equipment. It is important to note that the proposed system has not been  tested in-vivo or in-vitro to demonstrate its ability to detect loosening.  We conducted the experiment using three separate samples. By  exploring the feasibility of a patient-specific PLA 3D-printed hip implant  with integrated electronics, we contribute to SDG 3: Good Health and  Well-being by promoting advancements in orthopaedic implants that  improve patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and enhance overall  well-being. Furthermore, our innovative approach to hip implant  development and testing supports SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and  Infrastructure by fostering progress in orthopaedic implant  technologies.  3. Finite element analysis  The hip implantâ€™s finite element analysis (FEA) was performed to  replicate the quasi-static testing accurately. We used Autodesk Inventor  2023 to create the geometry and imported it into ANSYS 2022 (Ansys  Inc, USA). The only modifications made were to the hip implant and  embedding. A strain gauge measurement grid and a local coordinate  system were established on the lateral implant region, with the x-axis  oriented in the measurement direction. The force was applied to the  centre point of the head, which then propagated to the outer surface of  the taper. The cylindrical axis of the embedding material was loaded,  and the exterior of the embedding substance was constrained by  boundaries and loads, except for the top. The hip implant and embed- ding substance formed a symmetrical frictional contact with a friction  coefficient of 0.3. We used quadratic solid tetrahedral elements to mesh  both components. We employed a single element of a linear shell for the  strain gauge. The final mesh density was determined through a mesh  independence analysis and convergent output parameters with a Poisson  ratio (v) of 0.35. This ratio assumes the linear-elastic behaviour of the  material. We simulated the original non-cavity design to identify the  stress concentration factor. We performed a sensitivity analysis to  B.I.

R TRAC ED Structures 55 (2023) 28â€“38 30 understand how input variables affected output stress and strain. We  altered Youngâ€™s moduli by 2.5% after embedding and implanting and  considered embedding depths of 1 mm and alignments of 3â—¦ during  potting. Additionally, we adjusted the axial location of the neck by 0.5  mm to move the headâ€™s centre of mass. Our FEA research supports the  United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3: Good Health  and Well-being by advancing our understanding of orthopaedic implant  performance and identifying areas for improvement. Furthermore, using  FEA in this study contributes to SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and  Infrastructure by promoting innovative orthopaedic implant develop- ment and assessment methodologies.  3.1. Energy harvesting analysis  Implanted devices can potentially obtain power through energy  harvesting, which involves converting mechanical or chemical energy  into electrical energy from the bodyâ€™s movements. For example, knee,  hip, or shoulder movements can generate 49.5mW, 39.5mW, or 2.2mW,  respectively [38,39]. However, designing systems that efficiently har- vest energy at low gait frequencies (0.5â€“2 Hz) remains challenging. This  section explores how piezoelectric, electromagnetic, and electrome- chanical sensors can harvest energy. Piezoelectric materials, such as  Monolithic PZT, convert mechanical energy into electrical energy  through electrical polarisation under mechanical stress. Various  Fig. 1.

RETRACTED Structures 55 (2023) 28â€“38 31 researchers [40,41] have discussed using piezoelectric energy to power  intelligent knee implants. In one study, four piezoelectric devices con- nected to a knee implant produced 11mW of power during in-vitro  testing. The same study employed a low-frequency power system with  three integrated piezoelectric components to gather energy from tibio- femoral regions for an innovative knee implant. Conversely, a smaller  hip implant would require less energy. A hip implant could utilise a  piezoelectric ceramic diaphragm to harvest energy from axial loads. In  an in-vitro setting, this system generated 0.6mW [42â€“44]. However,  piezoelectric energy harvesters may be unsuitable for hip implants due  to their infrequent movement. This research on energy harvesting aligns  with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3: Good  Health and Well-being by investigating innovative ways to power  implanted devices, which could improve patientsâ€™ quality of life. Addi- tionally, this study supports SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infra- structure by promoting cutting-edge technologies and energy-efficient  solutions for developing and evaluating orthopaedic implants.  3.2. The equations of piezoelectricity  The piezoelectric effect is a unique phenomenon arising from the  linear electromechanical interaction between crystalline materialsâ€™  mechanical and electrical states. This effect is reversible and stems from  electrical and elastic mechanical behaviours. Linear piezoelectricity can  be understood through the following two laws that define the materialâ€™s  electrical and mechanical characteristics. Hookeâ€™s Law: This law de- scribes the elastic mechanical behaviour of materials. According to  Hookeâ€™s law, when a flexible material is subjected to stress, it undergoes  proportional deformation or strain. The relationship between stress and  strain is defined by the materialâ€™s stiffness, which is a property intrinsic  to the material. Linear Electrical Behavior: This law pertains to the  electrical response of a piezoelectric material when subjected to me- chanical stress. In piezoelectricity, linear electrical behaviour is char- acterised by the materialâ€™s ability to generate an electric charge or  potential difference in response to mechanical stress or strain. This  behaviour is governed by the piezoelectric coefficients specific to the  material. Together, these two laws help understand and predict the  piezoelectric effect in various materials. By analysing the interplay be- tween the electrical and mechanical properties of crystalline materials,  researchers can design and develop innovative applications that harness  the unique capabilities of piezoelectric materials:  D = ÎµEâ‡’Di = ÎµijEj (1)   S = sTâ‡’Sij = sijklTkl (2)  The electric charge density displacement electric displacement is  denoted by D, the permittivity denotes the free-body dielectric constant,  and the electric field strength is denoted by E. The Hookeâ€™s law for  elastic materials (2), S, strain, s represents compliance under short-  circuit conditions, T represents stress, and d represents the direct  piezoelectric effect., These relations may be combined into such a ma- trix. So-called coupled equations can be derived by combining these  relations; their strain-charge form is as follows:  S = s T + dtE (3)   D = d T + Îµ E (4)  We must concentrate on the matrix representation of those equa- tions. A matrix representation of the strain-charge relationship in  tetragonal PZT C4V, For example, The strain-charge. Strain-charge for a  4 mm (C4v) crystal class material such as a poled piezoelectric ceramic  such as tetragonal PZT or BaTiO3 and a 6 mm crystal class material, for  example, can be expressed using the same notation (ANSI IEEE 176):  (5)  In finite element analysis, the equations for piezoelectricity can be  described using constitutive equations that relate the mechanical stress,  strain, electric displacement, and electric field. The constitutive equa- tions for linear piezoelectric materials are as follows:  Strain-stress relationship (Hookeâ€™s Law):  Ïƒ ij = C ijkl * Îµ kl âˆ’ e ijk * E k (6)  Electric displacement-electric field relationship:  D i = d ijk * Ïƒ jk + Îµ ij * E j (7)  Here, Ïƒ_ij represents the stress tensor, Îµ_kl represents the strain  tensor, E_k represents the electric field vector, D_i represents the electric  displacement vector, C_ijkl represents the elastic stiffness tensor (relates  stress and strain), e_ijk represents the piezoelectric stress coefficients  tensor (relates stress and electric field), d_ijk represents the piezoelectric  strain coefficients tensor (relates strain and electric field), and Îµ_ij rep- resents the dielectric permittivity tensor (relates electric displacement  and electric field). In finite element analysis (FEA), these constitutive  equations are discretised and used to solve for the unknown field vari- ables (displacements, electric potentials) over a meshed domain of  numerous small elements. The FEA approach allows for accurately  simulating piezoelectric materialsâ€™ behaviour in complex geometries  and under varying loading conditions. By solving these equations for the  given boundary conditions and material properties, researchers can gain  insights into the performance of piezoelectric devices and optimise their  design for various applications.

RETRACTED Structures 55 (2023) 28â€“38 32 3.3. Sensitivity and FEA mesh   i. Types of Finite Elements and Meshing Study: The finite  element analysis utilised tetrahedral elements for most of the  model due to their versatility in complex geometries. A total of  100,000 tetrahedral elements were used. For areas requiring  higher precision, 10,000 hexahedral elements were applied. After  extensive meshing studies, a final mesh size of 0.5 mm guaran- teed convergence.   ii. Sensitivity Analysis: A comprehensive sensitivity analysis was  conducted through several iterations of the finite element model.  Various parameters were modified in each iteration, including  the material properties, boundary conditions, and loading con- ditions. In addition, response surface methodologies were used to  evaluate the impact of these parameters on the modelâ€™s output.   iii. Computational Cost: The computational cost of the models was  carefully monitored. The average CPU time for a single run of the  finite element model was approximately 2 h on a standard  workstation equipped with an Intel i7 processor and 16 GB of  RAM.   iv. Constitutive Model: The finite element analysis used an  isotropic linear elastic constitutive model. Material properties for  the model included Youngâ€™s modulus of 210 GPa and a Poissonâ€™s  ratio of 0.3. These values are representative of typical metallic  implant materials. The choice of this model reflects the assump- tion of small deformations and linear material behaviour under  the applied loads.  4. Results  To better understand total hip implant loosening before in-vivo  studies involving animals or humans, researchers utilise in-vitro labo- ratory experiments. The in-vitro system does not require a power source  or a communication method with the external environment, providing  flexibility in assessing implant loosening. Mechanical vibrations and  acoustic emissions have been employed to evaluate the loosening of an  implant. Multiple research groups[45â€“47] have applied vibration anal- ysis to detect the loosening of a prosthesis. The methodology involves  sending a vibration signal to the femoral condyle and recording the  response using an accelerometer, which measures the implantâ€™s motion.  Only the driving frequency would be observed in a well-fixed prosthesis,  where bone and prosthesis move together. The presence of more har- monics in the frequency spectrum indicates implant loosening. A  simplified loosening detector utilising vibrations has been developed,  Fig. 3.

RETRACTED Structures 55 (2023) 28â€“38 33 relying on an older method for detecting hip implant loosening [48â€“50].  Two accelerometers were embedded within the prosthesis to monitor  the changes in vibration frequency. The applied signal ranged from 500  to 2500 Hz, with loosening states identified between 1500 and 2500 Hz  and a frequency shift of 300 Hz. By placing an accelerometer in the  implant head, the driving frequency ranged from 500 to 2500 Hz, with a  loosening frequency range of 500 to 1500 Hz and a frequency shift of 20  to 100 Hz. An ultrasonic probe was used as a sensor instead of an  accelerometer in a similar design. The ultrasonic sensor output exhibited  higher harmonic ratios than the accelerometer output, shifting from 200  to 950 mHz [51â€“53]. Vibration analysis was also used to detect implant  loosening but with an accelerometer placed on the skin rather than  within the implant. This approach allows assessing multiple patients  without needing internal signal conditioning or antennas. The driving  frequency range was between 100 and 1500 Hz, while the detection  range was from 100 to 450 Hz. Fig. 3 illustrates a load concentration at  the base of the cavity, the hip implant deformation at ten different vi- bration frequencies, with the highest frequency for the 10th sample  being 1.9x10^-3. This deformation impacts the piezoelectric material,  causing it to generate more energy and voltage, contributing to the UNâ€™s  goals of sustainable and efficient energy production.  4.1. Testing and FE-model validation  The research results on Testing and FE-model validation, in line with  the UN goals, showed that at maximum load, the average strain was 614  m/m, accounting for 3% of the maximum strain. Each load increment  increased the strain by 61 m/m. The calculated strain gauge exhibited a  13.1% deviation from the average strain of the three specimens at each  load level. The most significant difference was 2300 N (92 m/m). Fig. 4  presents a robust R2 linear regression from experiments and FE simu- lations (0.997), with a slope of 0.8686 indicating the divergence. Hip  implant load concentrations were studied, as stress and strain are closely  related to linear-elastic material behaviour. Local load concentrations  were identified around the insertion level of the anterior and lateral hip  implants. The local singularity generated stress and strain that did not  follow the same direction due to contact modification.  Fig. 4 illustrates the comprehensive testing for a representative  specimen, detailing the resulting amplitude and power generated. Upper  and lower loads were primarily focused on Von Mises stress of maximum  value of 55678 MPa. The piezo materials exhibited the highest stress at  0.905 Âµm/Âµm and a volt generated of 1.78 volt, slightly inclined to the  side with the most significant load gradient. The strain gauge revealed  that the strain was more evenly distributed at the maximum von Mises  stress when a hollow was created at 163 MPa. The new shape increased  the stress level by 2.56 times compared to fatigue data for metallic  implant materials, typically reported as stress; piezo base loading was  represented as von Mises stress for sensitivity analysis. Fig. 4 does not  display the placement and orientation of the strain gauges, as they do  not have a significant impact. Any parameters except for and of the  region did not influence the tension at the piezo material base; all de- viations were 0.2%. A deviation of 0.8% is still considered relatively  minor. There were 420 MPa of tension between point C and the front  surface of the taper for all modifications that increased stress, amount- ing to a 1.3% increase (5 MPa). These results contribute to the UN goals  of promoting innovation and sustainability and ensuring healthy lives  and well-being by offering valuable insights into the performance and  validation of hip implant designs.  In line with the UN goals, the research results revealed that the three  samples underwent five million testing cycles without noticeable  breakage or deformation. The cyclic loading protocol was effectively  endured up to the maximum of 18 million cycles. This testing encom- passed the repetition and increased the protocol size across eight stages,  with one million processes performed at each level. Fig. 5 displays the  measured data for a representative sample, demonstrating that the  required force level was consistently maintained across various condi- tions. The displacement curve shows minimal movements, with  maximum force values always represented in red and femoral head  displacements in blue (Fig. 5). The force-controlled testing environment  likely contributed to the minor oscillations observed in the displacement  curve. After conducting dynamic testing at the load cell force limit of 5  kN for 18 million cycles without breakage, researchers proceeded with a  Fig. 4. Complete testing for an exemplary specimen of the resulting amplitude and power generated.   B.I.

RETRACTED Structures 55 (2023) 28â€“38 34 quasi-static experiment using a uniaxial testing machine with an  increased test load on the first specimen. The maximum force of 10.1 kN  was recorded when the prosthetic head was displaced by 4.74 mm, after  which the pressure dropped. The experiment halted at a vertical  displacement of 17.43 mm due to the dislodging of the ball ring beneath  the actuator.  Fig. 5 reveals significant plastic deformation of the hip implant at the  embedding site, but no fracture occurred. Following removal from the  embedding media, the maximum vertical displacement was 17.43 mm,  and the peak force at 4.74 mm was 10.1kN. Notably, the deformations  occurred at the embedding level, with the piezo on the bottom of the  strain gauge, which remained connected. Fig. 5 further illustrates the  linear relationship between FEA and strain gauge data. Each resulting  value was assigned one of three strains of the electric field (volt/um)  generated, voltage (volt) after compression, and potential energy (J)  (Table 1). These findings contribute to the UNâ€™s goals of promoting  innovation and sustainability and ensuring healthy lives and well-being  by providing valuable insights into the performance and endurance of  hip implant designs under various testing conditions.  4.2. Discussion  By the UN goals, the discussion reveals that the material exhibited  linear-elastic behaviour, as no stress hot spot exceeded Rp0.2 of 436  MPa. This finding was consistent with the assumptions made for the  numerical simulation. Small implant deformations may not have a sig- nificant impact on structural stiffness. Fig. 6 demonstrates the rela- tionship between experimental and numerical data, validating the  numerical model. However, despite considering sensitivity analysis  factors, only two-thirds of the experimental variation of 92 m/m can be  accounted for, suggesting that other variables may influence the simu- lated strain. The location of the strain gauge is critical, as small changes  in Youngâ€™s modulus and head centre point C significantly affect it. The  sensitivity analysis may have overlooked additional factors that influ- ence the simulated strain. The bonding process of attaching a strain  gauge to the polished hip implant could also introduce inaccuracies due  to glue thickness or sticky coatings interfering with strain readings. The  hip implantâ€™s curvature may have affected bonding. The FE model  treated the strain gauge as a single shell and ignored the curvature.  Consequently, the 13.1% discrepancy between calculations and ex- periments remains unexplained. Simulation-based fatigue data should  consider the indicated percentage variation due to the slight standard  deviation. The FE analysis results were higher than the actual stresses,  implying a conservative estimate. The study improved our understand- ing of loading by identifying fatigue-prone areas in the implantâ€™s  simulated stress distribution. Fig. 6 illustrates the harmonic response for  phase response with force and displacement. These insights contribute  Fig. 5. FE and strain gauge data show a linear relationship; each number result was given one of three strains of the electric field (volt/um) generated, voltage (volt)  after compression and potential energy (J).

RETRACTED Structures 55 (2023) 28â€“38 35 to the UN goals of promoting innovation, sustainability, and ensuring  healthy lives and well-being by providing valuable information on the  behaviour of hip implant materials under various conditions and the  factors that may influence their performance.  In line with the UN goals, finite element analysis (FEA) can provide  more insights than experimental fatigue testing, which merely de- termines pass/fail outcomes. By comparing the obtained values with  published data, it is possible to refine the design of stress hot zones, such  as tensile and compression areas on opposite sides of the upper and  lower neck. Research in similar situations supports these findings,  Fig. 6. Harmonic Response for Phase Response with the force and displacement.   Fig. 7.

Oladapo et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               RETRACTED Structures 55 (2023) 28â€“38 36 indicating that a piezoelectric device must be deformed to harvest en- ergy. That piezo-base materials stress concentration was predicted  [12,27]. A high gradient suggests the strain gauge may not function  correctly, and FEA can offer assistance. The maximum stress was 254  MPa, which the manufacturer understates. The stress maxima are 150  and 60 MPa higher than our previous physiological loading values. The  force distribution within the middle of the prosthetic head has changed  due to alterations in the embedding method and the absence of housing  or piezoelectric elements. According to the sensitivity study, modifying  the model did not impact the maximum stress. Strain gauge changes can  be disregarded. They only affect numerical values and become more  sensitive when the force lever is altered. All values increased by 422  MPa, which is lower than the fatigue data for this material (107 cycles,  10 Hz, in Eagleâ€™s medium at 37 â—¦C) but with the same stress ratio of R = 0.1, typical for implant loadings. Since this number depends on  manufacturing, surface smoothness, and size [41], it can only provide  estimates. Fig. 7 illustrates the test procedure diagram of quasi-static  testing for validation. Fatigue testing was conducted twice with pro- gressively higher loads to generate sweep angles concerning force and  stress. Fig. 8 displays the various results of electric voltage in the electric  field generator and energy in the piezoelectric materials. These findings  contribute to the UN goals of fostering innovation, promoting sustain- ability, and ensuring healthy lives and well-being by providing valuable  information on hip implant materialsâ€™ behaviour under various condi- tions and the factors that may influence their performance.  In the context of the UN goals, considering the FEA design model  variations from quasi-static testing, the 50 MPa difference between the  estimated maximum stress at the piezo material base and the reported  fatigue result is insignificant. Our experiments were successful, with  alignment, embedding, force, and cycles all performing well. The hip  implant design allowed for the best possible head offset and increased  loading by raising the lever. Although three samples were used instead  of the usual six, the research effectively demonstrates how the geome- tries of energy-harvesting implants impact fatigue failure. The three  samples were loaded and run twice, completing the required number of  cycles 3.6 times since no implants failed under higher stress. Conse- quently, implant design modifications are fatigue-resistant, even when  the yield threshold of the implant is exceeded during non-static testing.  Based on implant morphology, plastic deformation occurred at the  embedding level rather than in the piezo material, suggesting higher  loading. Although the production process deteriorates the surface, and  no fractures develop, rougher surfaces are easier to tread. Fig. 9 illus- trates the response of piezoelectric impedance with the displacement  and force magnitude. These findings contribute to the UN goals of  fostering innovation, promoting sustainability, and ensuring healthy  lives and well-being by providing valuable insights into the fatigue  resistance and performance of energy-harvesting implants under various  conditions. This knowledge can be used to improve implant design,  benefiting patients who rely on these devices for improved mobility and  quality of life.  5. Conclusion  This study presents a novel approach to energy-harvesting autono- mous implants, focusing on improving the performance and sustain- ability of hip prostheses. We investigated a modified hip implantâ€™s  structural stress failure strength for piezoelectric energy harvesting. We  compared experimental data with estimated stress levels using finite  element analysis. This process aids in refining the hip implant design,  enhancing load transfer to the piezoelectric element, and increasing  energy generation. The development of intelligent orthopaedic implants  is being explored as a potential solution to ensure the continuous  functionality of implants for an extended period. This research is  particularly relevant given the challenges in providing reliable and  Fig. 8.

RETRACTED Structures 55 (2023) 28â€“38 37 easily accessible power to active mechanical components of intelligent  prostheses. By applying a unique concept of multi-source energy gen- eration to hip prostheses, we aim to improve the reliability of power  supply systems in these devices. Our modified hip implant features three  vibration-based harvesters running in parallel to collect energy during  an average human stride. This modification demonstrates the feasibility  of the concept, capitalising on the angular movements resulting from  flexion, extension, and abduction. We measured and analysed the output  of each generator across a wide range of frequencies and amplitudes,  revealing the potential to harvest up to 55 J/s of helpful power and 1.76  V. With this innovative approach, intelligent hip implants can continue  functioning regularly without being disabled and operate without risk.  This research contributes to the UNâ€™s goals of promoting innovation,  ensuring healthy lives and well-being, and fostering sustainability in  healthcare solutions. Future studies will further explore energy con- version and fatigue in a complete hip implant design.
