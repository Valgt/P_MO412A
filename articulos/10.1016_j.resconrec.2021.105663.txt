                  Social value in the built environment refers to the social impact any organisation, project or program in that industry makes to the lives of the stakeholders affected by its activities. Social value is a national/ organisation level practical vehicle for realising the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It is particularly relevant in the context of the continued increase in the global development of the built environment through construction and infrastructure projects involving many different stakeholders. We examine clients’, consultant, local authority, and contractors’ social value organisational learning journeys and reveal how they have transformed their systems towards more sustainable production. We also show how their efforts collectively align to achieve social value and thus realise the SDGs beyond what any individual project or initiative would be able to deliver alone. We present a transformative case study of social value in practice, which has a partnership model at its heart, and the potential to inform future methodologies for business and community engagement to improve social outcomes. We demonstrate the considerable organisational learning effort that is made with the aim to achieve a variety of SDGs through a value-based approach to business and interorganisational relations. In our work, it is the contractors who play a central role in bringing together the different influences and managing agency-structure interplay within this social practice. The partnership approach explored in this paper offers a way to ensure more efficient use of resources in the hugely important development of the built environment.

Keywords Social value  Organisational learning  Partnership  Nexus  Built environment    1 Introduction The built environment sector has a major impact on the lives of people, the prosperity of businesses, and the resilience, health, and well-being of communities through planning, design, construction and management of urban environments, buildings, and infrastructure. Social value in the built environment refers to the social impact that any organisation, project or programme in that sector makes to the lives of people and communities that are affected by its activities (Raiden et al., 2019 ). Research on social value in the built environment is increasing in momentum and important for the development of organisational practice in this space. As it is an emerging concept, practice varies widely. There are exemplars of good practice (see for example: Supply Chain Sustainability School, 2017 ), but on the whole relatively few have embraced this new currency in procurement or construction practice to full potential (Loosemore, 2016 ). Work in the built environment invariably involves many different stakeholders, such as clients, design and planning professionals, engineering and construction professionals and workers, trades, suppliers, facilities management providers and their personnel, and community groups and their members. We examine different stakeholders’ social value organisational learning journeys, and we show how their activities and interventions over time have aligned and collectively achieve social value. Our research question therefore asks how different stakeholders’ organisational learning journeys on social value aid the achievement of the SDGs . 1.1 Social value and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Social value is a national/ organisation level practical vehicle for realising the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Raiden et al., 2019 : xviii). The SDGs seek to address the world’s increasingly urgent environmental, political, and economic challenges. There are 17 SDGs and 169 targets in total, meaning each goal includes 8–12 targets. Launched in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the SDGs can be considered aspiration statements (United Nations, 2015 ). They evolved to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which since 2000 had focused on reducing poverty, hunger, child mortality and deadly diseases, whilst growing access to water and free primary education to all children. Adopted by 193 countries, the SDGs seek to guide sustainable development to take account of people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership (United Nations, 2015 ). In terms of progress towards meeting the SDGS, all 166 countries included in the 2020 SDG Index have made progress, with South and East Asian countries having made the most progress since 2015 (Sachs et al., 2020 ). The top five SDGs associated with the most ‘good practices’ are 17: Partnerships for Goals, 4: Quality Education, 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, and 1: No Poverty (United Nations, 2020 ). Covid-19 has profoundly impacted progress towards meeting all SDGs, with a particularly negative impact on poverty (SDG 1), food security (SDG 2), health (SDG 3), the economy (SDG 8), and multilateralism (SDG 17) (ibid). From an organisational perspective, a mixed picture emerges. Gunzën-Jensen et al. (2020 ) focused their research on social entrepreneurs and found they had strong reservations about the SDGs. However, research exploring sustainable business practices and financial performance in pre- and post-SDG adoption periods found that the SDGs are well received by organisations in general, who tended to prioritise the social and environmental dimensions (Muhmad and Muhamad, 2020 ). Moreover, a more positive relationship was reported between sustainability practices and financial performance in post-SDG adoption (ibid).  1.2 SDGs and the built environment We build on existing research on the SDGs in the built environment. Globally, the sector accounted for 39% of energy and process-related carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions and 36% of final energy use in 2018, with 11% being a direct consequence of manufacturing building materials and products (Global ABC, 2019 ). The importance of the built environment in meeting the SDGs is clear when one considers that 44% of the 169 targets, across all SDGs, are dependent on construction and real estate activities (Goubran, 2019 ). The global population is expected to rise from 7.7 billion in 2019 to 9.7 billion in 2050, with an associated doubling in the number of people who live in urban areas to 70% of the population (United Nations, 2019 ). The population increase is expected to be accompanied by an 80% rise in energy use (OECD, 2012 ) as well as 3.9 billion people facing water-insecurity (Guppy and Anderson, 2017 ). The built environment has a central role to play in sustainably meeting this expected growth through the planning, design, construction and management of urban environments, buildings, and infrastructure. For Opoku (2019)  the construction industry can help influence the realisation of the SDGs through sustainable practices driven by policy and regulatory frameworks. However, for Russell et al. (2018) the complex nature of construction supply chains means that the promotion of shared values and transparent third-party oversight are more effective ways of driving sustainable consumption and production than control mechanisms such as legislation and regulation. Whichever approach, or mixture of approaches is adopted, it requires the involvement of a range of actors. We focus on the ability to create significant impact in the huge global construction and infrastructure market, which is forecast to increase output from US$10.8 trillion in 2017 to US$12.9 trillion by 2022 (Global Data, 2018 ). Social value offers a way to meet all 17 of the SDGs, at least indirectly, and ideally it is the nexus (see Bleischwitz et al., 2018 ) of an integrated approach that delivers on the SDGs in a resource efficient manner. For the purposes of brevity, we table the SDGs and selected target examples relevant to the built environment below. As work in the built environment crosscuts across all the SDGs, the sector plays a fundamental role in creating positive change (Opoku, 2016 ). However, even a succinct summary of the 17 SDGs and carefully prioritised target examples (as presented in Table 1  ) can be met with the critique that the ambitions are overly generic, broad in scope, and too high level to offer a meaningful guide for action for individuals or organisations. Hence, whilst most of the SDGs feature in our findings, our discussion hereon primarily relates to SDGs 9, 10, 11, 12, 16 and 17 because these are present at the centre of good practice on social value and organisational learning in our data.  1.3 Organisational learning and the SDGs in the built environment Learning at an individual level is about a long-term change in the knowledge, skill, attitudes, or values which may lead to a person having increased potential to perform, develop and grow (Smith and Sadler-Smith, 2006 ). Organisational learning refers to the collective processes and culture of many individuals learning in a work context, knowledge management and continuous improvement (Wang and Ahmed, 2003 ). It is more than the sum of the individuals’ learning; it is about a system of change in organisational strategy, policy, and practice, where organisational culture institutionalises transformation rather than the status quo. Organisations that continually facilitate the learning of their members, continually transform themselves in harmony with the prevailing operating context, nurture new and expansive patterns of thinking, and learn how to learn (so called learning organisations, cf. Senge, 1990 ; Pedler et al., 1991 ) and benefit from an advanced and sophisticated approach to organisational learning. Research suggests that some construction organisations take the form of a chaordic learning organisation (Raiden and Dainty, 2006 ). The central characteristics of such an enterprise are discontinuous growth, organisational consciousness, connectivity, flexibility, continuous transformation, and self-organisation (van Eijnatten, 2004 ). Despite its attractive qualities, organisational learning has received relatively little attention within research in the built environment or at an applied level in company practices (Loosemore et al., 2003 : 255; Abdel-Wahab et al., 2009 ; Chiponde et al., 2020 ). It is often external forces that are driving individual and organisational learning and practice on social value at present (Raiden et al., 2019 : 10). Organisations in all sectors, including the built environment, are converging in their practices because of coercive and mimetic isomorphism; that is, pressure from legislative frameworks and societal expectations, and modelling or imitating other organisations because this is believed to be beneficial or necessary. However, some external forces, such as the SDGs, have not yet realised their full potential to engender change. This is in part because of the tendency for the SDGs to be considered together, as a set, which can overwhelm well-intended organisational learning and development interventions. This is especially so where organisational learning is simply equated to the sum of individual learning within organisations. Whilst this person-centred view of learning can be explicitly linked to some of the SDGs, such as SDG 4: quality education (promoting lifelong learning for all), it can be difficult to see how individual learning might contribute towards many other important SDGs, for example SDG 17: partnerships for the goals (strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development). The latter is essential and urgent for sustainable, inclusive, and resilient development (Stibbe and Prescott, 2020 : 6). Such concern echoes more general and longstanding critique and discussion about conceptual polarisation and unit/ process specificity in organisational learning (see for example Dunphy et al., 1997 ; Ricciardi et al., 2020 ). Instead of system-level knowledge management and organisational learning focused on achieving the common good, extant literature tends to offer a path from organisational learning to organisational performance. We forward a broader perspective which suggests that organisational learning includes the notions of process, i.e. learning and knowing, and the notion of the outcomes of those processes, on multiple levels (after Dunphy et al., 1997 : 235; Ortenblad, 2001 : 129; Ricciardi et al., 2020 : 7). Such a view is essential for organisations in the built environment to better manage the journey towards a sustainable change (Chan et al., 2004 ; Opoku and Fortune, 2011 ). We argue that organisational learning, as a construct which supports learning within organisations, must move further forward on the individual-collective continuum and be understood at the level of a system (be it a process, supply-chain, or industry) if we are to reach systemic advances towards achieving the SDGs and creating social value. Learning must occur between organisations too, e.g. within the long construction supply-chain, and collectively different organisations can realise the most significant progress when they co-create social value together (Miner and Mezias, 1996 ; Raiden et al., 2019 ). Connecting social value, organisational learning, and the SDGs, shows promise as a means to realise the wider social, economic and environmental impact in a way that allows all organisations to benefit from efficient resource management. We argue that each stakeholder can then target their resource utilisation and organisational learning to meet their core business purpose and goals, and at the same time make a maximum contribution to the global collective project. We use social practice theory to frame our discussion and focus attention on social value practice .   2 Research approach and method The ‘practice approach’ (Schatzki et al., 2001 ) and social practice theory (see for example Schatzki, 1996 ; Reckwitz, 2002 ; Hargreaves, 2011 ; Shove et al., 2012 ) offer an advantageous theoretical framing for research where connections between context, social activity and change are of interest. Literature in this space is aligned along the principles and philosophical foundations “tied to an interest in the ‘everyday’ and ‘life-world’”  (Reckwitz, 2002 : 244). The practice itself, rather than the individuals who perform them or the social structures that surround them are the core unit of analysis (Hargreaves, 2011 : 82). Social situations are influenced by individual choices and actions; yet they are shaped by broader structures and meaning (after Giddens, 1984 ; Reckwitz, 2002 ; Shove et al., 2012 : 11–12). It is not the pursuit of individual interest, nor the outcome of external forces alone that orders everyday life, but rather an ongoing play and duality of agency and structure. Thus, social practice theory helps us bring together different narratives and experiences of social value and it offers a holistic yet grounded framework for analysis of how social value as practice emerges and evolves. Whilst this approach may restrict our ability to make universal generalizations, an issue that would be seen as a significant disadvantage in the conventional positivistic paradigm (Hargreaves, 2011 : 84), it leads to richer and more subtle accounts of action and embeddedness in empirical analysis (Reckwitz, 2002 : 259). We present insights from a range of key stakeholders, who have all recently worked through social value related transformation processes in the built environment: two clients, a consultant, a city council (local authority), and two contractors. Since our goal was not to generalize to a population, but instead to obtain insights into the phenomenon, we purposefully selected individuals and organisations that helped us maximize understanding of social value and organisational learning (Onwuegbuzie and Leech, 2007 : 111). Thus, we used criterion sampling to identify key informants who (i) worked in the built environment sector, (ii) are explicitly committed to social value, (iii) were aware of the SDGs, and (iv) had managed or were currently engaged with organisational learning. We describe their journeys using three sources of data: (i) extracts from phenomenological conversational interviews (after Given, 2008 ; Berner-Rodoreda et al., 2018 ), which were conducted face-to-face and via video and telephone during winter and spring 2019–2020; (ii) written research correspondence; and (iii) published material about the organisations. The research process was a developmental journey to co-create and refine our collective understanding of social value, organisational learning, and the SDGs through continuous critical reflection. There were several contact points with the different stakeholders, and we worked through a circular process that consisted of the following:(1) Initial contact, during which the participants’ interest to take part in the research was sought and confirmed, and we verified our sampling criterion had been met.  (2) First interviews: all respondents were interviewed at least once. Client 1 interview was with the Business Development Director, and Client 2 interview with the Head of Procurement. From the Consultant organisation we interviewed the Founding Partner. The City Council Senior Principal Urban Design and Conservation Officer was interviewed within the Local Authority. Contractor 1 interviews were with the Regional Commercial Manager, Senior Commercial Manager, and the Community and Regeneration Advisor; and Contractor 2 interview was with a Senior Sustainability Executive.  (3) Accessing published materials, to source detailed information about the organisation and follow up links provided by the respondents during the initial contacts and/ or first interviews. We accessed all the organisations’ websites at least once.  (4) Reflective Practice Reports: all participants created a reflective report outlining the development and application of their social value activities including the challenges, successes, and key learning points.  (5) Written correspondence, to share the research team’s interpretation and presentation of the respondent’s accounts and verify they were accurate. Many respondents provided additional information and clarification at this stage, and so we followed this up by accessing further published materials and/ or more interviews.  (6) Accessing published materials, including Client 1 business blogs and a business report; Client 2 local news article1  1 We have not provided a reference to this article in order to preserve the anonymity of the participating organisation.  ; Consultant business reports; Local Authority business process chart, strategy documents, organograms, ward and project-specific data; Contractor 1 project-specific social value policies and procedures, and key performance indicators; and, Contractor 2 social value policy documents, various organisation and project-specific key performance indicators, blogs and company reports.  (7) Subsequent interviews: the Client 1 Business Development Director, the Founding Partner of the Consultancy organisation, and the Local Authority Senior Principal Urban Design and Conservation Officer were all interviewed three times. Contractor 1 Senior Commercial Manager was interviewed twice, and the Community and Regeneration Advisor was interviewed four times. Contractor 2 Senior Sustainability Executive was interviewed twice.  (8) Further written correspondence: to verify the interpretations and presentation were accurate.    Throughout the interviews and written correspondence, while we gained information for research purposes, the research respondents reported their ongoing organisational learning and change: our research process helped develop their understanding and social value practice. As we shared information amongst the different stakeholders, they were able to gain insights and an appreciation of social value from different perspectives and use that to enhance organisational learning. In this way, the research process and organisational practice informed one another and facilitated an approach to action research and organisational learning whereby we unearth and share data (input), learn from the data and take action (transformation), and observe changes in perspectives and behaviour (output) (Coghlan, 2011 ). Action research is one of the distinctive features of organisational development and learning (French and Bell, 1999 ; Wang and Ahmed, 2003 ), and in its core is the powerful notion that human systems can only be understood and changed if they involve the members of the system in the inquiry process itself (Coghlan, 2011 ).  3 Findings and discussion We describe each of the stakeholders’ organisational learning journeys on social value in turn, before discussing how they align with the SDGs. 3.1 Clients We connected with two large Housing Associations in England; one with nearly 6000 homes and another with 21,000 homes, and both with an extensive portfolio of health, care and employment support services delivered to customers who don’t live in their homes. Wellbeing is core to their business purpose. A critical journey of social value-focused organisational development for both organisations has centred around achieving united commitment to social value and focusing on the quality of the relationships between the employees and customers. Our research respondents report that it is imperative that they elicit every ounce of value out of their capital projects, through prioritising social value, as the projects consume a mass of resources and are likely to be in use for the next 50–100 years, or longer. The client with nearly 6000 homes derived their initial steer from a Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) guide on commissioning excellent capital projects for public bodies and community organisations (CABE, 2002 ). In particular, a note to suggest that ‘clients should spend enough time at the right time in a project’ had a strong influence on how they now commission projects. The team have learned that to achieve a successful project they need to take time on the brief, select the right design team, develop the brief with that team, review and critique the proposals at every stage, and enshrine the design thinking in the ongoing management and maintenance of the project. The client with 21,000 homes has employed a dedicated person to champion social value, and they have developed awareness-raising communications and training programmes to increase organisational capability in this area. Showcasing achievements has worked well in engendering commitment to considering and creating social value. More recently this client has also articulated social value within their corporate plan and included it as one of the key business objectives. Their activity now focuses on ‘building’ three-fold: building homes; building people, skills, and confidence; and building communities. This all starts with developing an in-depth understanding of the communities within which they operate. Both clients emphasise that multiple stakeholders’ input is essential internally in two ways: top down and bottom up internally, and externally with partner institutions like universities and their students, suppliers, and consultants. Sometimes people and organisations with specialist interests are required. The client with nearly 6000 homes reports one building project involving a selection of people with varying religious beliefs who were consulted regarding a prayer room, and a panel of disability and inclusion specialists involved in considerations of how to best ensure the building could deliver on equality of opportunity and diversity. An inspirational design team was central to translating the client brief into a short document that showcased their commitment to equality and diversity, and sustainability. The project architect provided leadership in regular team meetings, where creative tensions, different perspectives and new relationships in the team kept the thinking fresh and eventually delivered a great result. As some of the members in the professional team had not worked together before, there were different expectations around, for example, the level of detail in the contract documents and specification of materials. Discussions to resolve such issues took time. The client with 21,000 homes reported that translating their social value requirements and what they mean for different suppliers and other project partners was one of their greatest challenges yet proved a cornerstone to effective delivery of social value in practice. Supporting the supply-chain in co-creating social value and specifically connecting with small businesses locally is important to continuing and successfully delivering the maximum impact. The two clients emphasise the interconnectedness of their own social value learning journey with those of other stakeholders, and as such SDGs 12 Responsible consumption and production, and 17 Partnerships for the goals, take a centre stage in their contributions. They also actively seek to enhance equality of opportunity. The other SDGs prominent in the clients’ accounts are 5 Gender equality, 9 Industry, innovation and infrastructure, 10 Reduced inequalities, 11 Sustainable cities and communities, and 16 Peace, justice and strong institutions. Promoting public procurement practices that are sustainable (target 12.7) and encouraging and promoting effective public, public-private and civil society partnerships, building on the experience and resourcing strategies of partnerships (17.17) are the most prominent means for them to create social value. This partnership approach is also beneficial for achieving the Clients’ business goals and enhancing the quality of the relationships between the organisation, its suppliers, employees, and customers. Both Clients were aware of social value and the SDGs and embraced the concepts in their organisational value statements.  3.2 Consultant The consultant view was provided by a Midlands based multi-disciplinary construction consultancy that operates nationwide in the UK. They work on community, public sector, socio-economic, and people-focussed regeneration programmes with social value at their core. The consultants are keen to give back to the communities in which they serve, and they seek to continually develop to and be responsive to changing contexts (e.g. new legislative measures such as the Social Value Act) and drive innovation in sustainability. Education and skills training are central to their approach. They deliver pro bono lectures, seminars, training, and workshops on a wide range of built environment topics to university students, industry practitioners, local people, community groups and the third sector. Their work extends to include work experience to school children, apprenticeships, sponsored education to masters level, and supporting the Prince’s Regeneration Trust ‘BRICK’ heritage education programme. The multiplier effect of local expenditure drives the consulting organisation to require their contractors to use local supply chains, guarantee that an agreed percentage of site labour is sourced locally, and provide training programmes and apprenticeships for adults and young people. The company itself is also committed to:• Employing local staff - all equity partners live and work in the local community and they generate jobs for people living in the local area.  • Recruiting young people direct from local education providers in order to develop and retain core skills in the local community and providing personalised training throughout their careers.    More specific examples of the consultants’ social value initiatives include:• Securing funding to help a local Parish Council develop a Parish Plan that in turn guided a District Council Local Plan.  • Advising District Councils on custom and self-building throughout North Derbyshire and   supporting a local school to secure £7500 to create an allotment-style school garden.    In terms of ‘the environment’ the consultants have combined their commitment to minimising the effect of their operations on the environment with a recognition that this can make sound commercial sense to all parties. Specifics actions include:• Leading sustainability reviews for professional project teams that promote client awareness of reduced energy consumption in the construction and operation of buildings.  • Delivery of Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM), which assesses, rates, and certifies the sustainability of buildings.  • Promotion of electronic tendering on all projects.  • Reduced travel through homeworking, video conferencing and maintenance to minimise harmful vehicular emissions.  • Built-estate energy efficiency and energy saving including consolidated stationary orders, continual reduction of utility use including, low energy lighting, high efficiency boilers, improved insulation, use of renewable energy suppliers and reduced paper use.    The consultant is focused on industry, innovation and the environment. SDGs 9 Industry, innovation and infrastructure, 11 Sustainable cities and communities, 12 Responsible consumption and production, 13 Climate action, and 17 Partnerships for the goals are all areas where the consultant is making considerable advances towards achieving the SDGs. Other SDGs prominent in the consultant’s account are 4 Quality education, 7 Affordable and clean energy, 8 Decent work and economic growth, 10 Reduced inequalities, and 16 Peace, justice and strong institutions. Upgrading infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes (target 9.4) is central to the consultant’s social value interventions; both internally and in managing their supply-chain. This works hand in hand with the aim to enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanization and capacity for participatory, integrated and sustainable human settlement planning and management in all countries (target 11.3) and promoting public procurement practices that are sustainable (target 12.7). Their impact on the environment is recognised and actively considered in the way the business is operated and how they advise their clients and they take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts via education, awareness-raising and improved human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning (target 13.3). The strong value base that drives the consultancy organisation’s approach to social value supports achievements towards ensuring responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels (target 16.7) and encouraging and promoting effective public, public-private and civil society partnerships, building on the experience and resourcing strategies of partnerships (target 17.17). The Founding Partner is conceptually fluent, and the SDGs are central to the organisation’s mission, vision, and practice; they are committed to creating a sustainable future through the built environment. This is one of their unique selling points which helps to position and differentiate them in the marketplace.  3.3 Local authority The view of the City Council Senior Principal Urban Design and Conservation Officer that we connected with is that social variables of place are not considered fully in the industry. Despite an increasing interest in environmental issues, there is a strong bias towards economic factors in the UK. The National Planning Policy Framework (Department for Communities and Local Government, 2012 ) sought to reform planning and initiate a period of increased neighbourhood engagement and governance through the introduction of Neighbourhood Plans, Local Development Orders and Local Listing. However, the majority of changes were optional and underprivileged communities often found themselves lacking the skills and resources to deliver owing to the technical complexities of the British planning system. Local government is responsible for delivering community empowerment through the planning system at two core levels:(a) incorporating social structure analysis as part of the baseline studies for policy development;  (b) delivering continuous engagement strategies that focus on targeting social variables through the process itself.    To help meet critical social targets and support a local ambition to become carbon neutral, the City Council where our research participant works is keen to deliver high quality socially valuable developments by focusing on two main strands:• social resilience – resolving problems and creating wealth through the communities’ capacity to work together  • social capital – social norms, mutual trust, and the capacity of communities to form relationships and networks.    In order to achieve this, a process of internal and external transformation was recently initiated which requires a cultural shift and cross-sector engagement and education to change attitudes and behaviours. Communities have been involved in shaping new design guidance through a process of empowerment that gave voice to minorities and groups that were previously excluded from policy development. In contrast to the clients and consultant who have more specifically focused their social value and organisational development efforts, the work of the local authority is quite evenly spread across meeting all but one of the SDGs. SDGs 10 Reduced inequalities, 11 Sustainable cities and communities, 16 Peace, justice and strong institutions, and 17 Partnerships for the goals are central to the local authority. It is clear however that SDGs 1 No poverty, 3 Good health and well-being, 5 Gender equality, and 8 Decent work and economic growth also feature high on their agenda. SDGs 2 Zero hunger, 4 Quality education, 6 Clean water and sanitation, 7 Affordable and clean energy, 9 Industry, innovation and infrastructure, 12 Responsible consumption and production, 13 Climate action, and 15 Life on land are considered. Given that the local authority is located within a landlocked region, it is not surprising that the SDG 14 Life below water is the only SDGs that is not visible in their plans. Empowering and promoting the social, economic, and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status has been at the heart of the change programme on carbon management (target 10.2). Strengthening of institutional, systemic, and individual capacity-building by enhancing inclusive and sustainable urbanization and participatory, integrated, and sustainable human settlement planning and management (target 11.3) is a clear focus and a key area of responsibility for the local authority, driven by national policy framework. Ensuring responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making (target 16.7) and encouraging and promoting effective public, public-private and civil society partnerships, building on the experience and resourcing strategies of partnerships (target 17.17) similarly feature at the heart of the Council’s plans and activities, evident in the form of cross-sector engagement. This cross-sector approach and the Council’s priority areas align closely with the United Nation’s identified areas of good practice (highlighted earlier in Section 1.1 ), and also help improve quality of life and build a new form of clean growth for the local economy.  3.4 Contractors Construction contracting businesses provide a range of services across a range of sectors for a range of different clients spending widely different amounts of money, many of whom are inexperienced and will infrequently use construction services. The clients will also have widely different levels of knowledge and expectations regarding social value, and themselves serve a range of stakeholders, each with differing and often competing needs. The ability to respond to such diverse social value needs provides contractors with a distinct challenge. We explored how two large UK contractors have responded to this challenge and developed their own organisational approaches to creating social impact through the use of assessment and measurement. Four important themes arise from our contact with the contractors: (i) start by understanding what creates impact, (ii) understanding the contractor, (iii) understanding the client, and (iv) understanding the supply chain. 3.4.1 Start by understanding what creates impact Consideration of what is important to the contractors, their clients, and communities they serve, and their supply chain is key and requires the consistent use of assessment and measurement tools. One contractor reports that to understand what is important requires an understanding of what activities have created impact by reviewing previous performance. There are a range of measurement and assessment methods that exist (albeit TOMs are proving increasingly popular for a range of clients) and whichever methods are selected, they must be applied consistently over a range of projects. Considering what value has been created historically creates a picture of what has been achieved so far and crucially identifies what is not working – there may have been a focus on activities with a low socio-economic value and as such future interventions will be better focused on high impact activities.  3.4.2 Understanding the contractor Our participants stress that for them, despite assessment and measurement being so important, social value is far from simply being ‘a numbers game’. Rather, as one participant explained: ”It comes from the heart and social purpose is in our DNA”.  Indeed, they state that creating positive social impact has been at the centre their businesses for years, long before they began referring to it as social value. Joined-up thinking to reap the benefits of social value at programme level is evident in the Transforming Communities initiative, where public authorities and registered providers can leverage construction and housing repair contracts to deliver additional social value to local communities and various key performance indicators (KPIs). Building on the important ‘people’ aspect, they are increasingly integrating social value in business processes to further incorporate it into their businesses. Making a difference where the clients want them to is crucially important, as is being able to create social impact where this is not driven by the client. In this way, the contractors’ social value orientation often drives the process of creating social value.  3.4.3 Understanding the client Whilst many clients are becoming more adept at creating social value, many do not know how. This is where the contractors are able to help them understand what is important to the communities they serve and also what is important to the contractors, which extends over all their projects. The contractors we interviewed now develop bespoke social value plans based on research that draws on local authority growth plans and engaging with local community organisations. This approach allows them to make lasting impacts. Moreover, they state that there is an increasing need to redefine what is meant by community and continue to develop ways to really understand what is needed and evaluate what has been delivered, such as through a recognised social value standard.  3.4.4 Understanding the supply chain The construction contracting model places the contractor at the heart of a network of supply chains that galvanise to meet specific client needs. As such, contractors’ ability to create social value throughout their supply chain holds vast potential. To provide some context, our research participants’ supply chains extend to thousands of organisations providing products, goods and services across the wide variety of specialised sectors they service, and includes sub-contractors and their sub-contractors who, in turn, each work for a variety of different contractors. Creating and measuring impact represents a significant organisation learning project that starts with honesty. Manipulating key metrics for short-term gain will diminish the ability to improve. Understanding what is important to the supply chain and what drives them is essential as is supporting organisations to develop and grow. Specific targets to continually increase expenditure with social enterprises and Modern Slavery Act training for their most important supply chain partner directors are examples of specific interventions. Similarly, ensuring the supply chain records the social value they create allow whole project social value to be captured and communicated. Positively impacting young people lays at the centre of their approach. This serves both social and economic needs as the construction industry faces a looming skills shortage owing to an ageing workforce and failure to attract new entrants. However, extending reach to include other groups facing issues, older people, and ex-offenders/care-leavers, is also important. At core, there is a focus on where people start their journey, not just where they end up. A systemic approach to training, in the form of an academy which develops skills in-house to meet organisational needs, was set up by one of the Contractors to facilitate learning. The contractors meet a wide range of SDGs directly (4 Quality education, 8 Decent work and economic growth, 9 Industry, innovation and infrastructure, 10 Reduced inequalities, 12 Responsible consumption and production, 16 Peace, justice and strong institutions and 17 Partnerships for the goals) and indirectly (1 No poverty, 3 Good health and well-being, and 5 Gender equality). Their resulting approaches allow them to help educate their clients and importantly create social value on their projects irrespective of their clients’ social value orientation. Working across a range of sectors for different clients allows them to target 9.4 through upgrading infrastructure and retrofitting industries thereby helping achieve better resource efficiency and clean and environmentally sound technologies. In addition, this also helps them ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory, and representative decision-making at all levels (target 16.7) and encourage and promote effective public, public-private, and civil society partnerships, building on the experience and resourcing strategies of partnerships (target 17.17). Their approach to creating organisational learning throughout their supply chains allows them to perform an important job of reintegrating a historically fragmented industry and meet a verity of SDGs. For example, the increasing skills shortage is tackled through training interventions and engaging older people, ex-offenders and care leavers for employment, decent jobs, and entrepreneurship (target 4.4). At the same time, this will help in substantially reducing the proportion of youth not in employment, education, or training (target 8.6). By training the leaders of their most important supply chain partners they help empower and promote the social, economic and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status (target 10.2). In addition, the efforts to continually increase expenditure with social enterprises helps to promote public procurement practices that are sustainable, in accordance with national policies and priorities (target 12.7).   3.5 Nexus: organisational learning, social value, SDGs, and resource efficiency We find it interesting to discover that SDG 17 Partnerships for the goals attracts most attention in our respondents’ accounts. This is encouraging. As we note in the introduction, the SDG 17 is essential and urgent for sustainable, inclusive, and resilient development (Stibbe and Prescott, 2020 : 6). The development of the built environment has always been complex and diverse, and the most common characterisation of the construction and infrastructure industry is that it is fragmented. The key stakeholders in our research demonstrate that considerable organisational learning effort is made with the aim of collectively achieving the SDGs. Instead of drawing attention to others’ contribution, or the abstract space in between, the clients, consultant, local authority, and contractors included in this study make explicit organisational commitment to value-based business. They dedicate substantial effort into managing the interorganisational relations by understanding and communicating different project partners’ needs and priorities, and ensuring multiple stakeholders are involved in the design and consultation processes. This supports our proposition that learning must occur between organisations (as well as within) so that collectively they can realise the most significant progress by co-creating social value. Employing social practice theory as the framework for analysis helped us uncover how organisations have learnt and developed their social value practice and it exposed the agency-structure interplay. The clients report heavy emphasis on agency: relationships between them and their customers, the relevant professional body, and a range of key project stakeholders (such as the lead architect). The consultant and city council officer highlight how structural elements like legislation and national policy guide change in their practice. Importantly, it is the contractors who play a central role in bringing together the different influences and managing the agency-structure interplay, whilst also negotiating their own value base in the relationship. Our findings demonstrate worthwhile progress towards closing the gap between short-term behaviour and longer-term organisational learning that Bresnen and Marshall (2000)  aired. Certainly, this small selection of professionals in the built environment have embraced the SDGs’ global call for action: they have taken clear steps in organisational learning to realise the partnership approach to creating and delivering social value, and showcase specific ways of achieving the SDGs most closely connected to their business. As a system, they collectively make substantial progress towards achieving most of the SDGs, yet the partnership approach allows each stakeholder to carefully organise and direct their resources towards the actions most relevant to them: the clients specialise in reducing inequality (SDGs 5 and 10), the consultant focuses efforts on reducing environmental impact (SDG 13) and the contractors contribution centres on education, work and innovation (SDGs 4, 8 and 9). The potential to leverage these benefits across the global construction and infrastructure sector are huge. The partnership approach offers promise to further organisational learning by utilising strategic partnerships as a temporary hybrid organisation that combines institutional logics and integrates distinct organisational capabilities and resources for the benefit of a project or a programme (see Frederiksen and Gottlieb, 2020 ). This way of organising produces knowledge that can be transposed by the individual companies, and in turn lead to company-specific changes and innovations (ibid) where the partners learn from one another and in time work towards achieving a more comprehensive range of the SDGs. Thus, we showcase an example of a systemic method of organisational learning with dual aims: to help achieve common good and secure organisational performance. Resource efficiency is also achieved by our research participants’ second and third most prominent focus on SDGs 11 Sustainable cities and communities and 12 Responsible consumption and production. Through inclusive and sustainable urbanization and enhanced capacity for participatory, integrated and sustainable human settlement planning and management (target 11.3) and promoting procurement practices that are sustainable, in accordance with national policies and priorities (target 12.7) the clients, consultant, city council officer, and the contractors influence the sourcing and use of resources from within their wider supply-chains. Given our sampling strategy, it is no surprise that the organisations are pioneering good practice. They are values driven, rather than motivated by external pressures. Their social value-related organisational learning journeys are continuous, and as much a part of the organisational culture as well as a process and an outcome. Our research confirms a significant and growing focus on learning through collaboration within the built environment (Walker, 2016 ). The stakeholders’ varied accounts direct attention towards a nexus of SDGs that naturally aligns with the nature of work and production in the built environment, most notably SDGs 11 Sustainable cities and communities, 12 Responsible consumption and production, and 17 Partnerships for the goals, but also SDGs 9 Industry, innovation and infrastructure, 10 Reduced inequalities, and 16 Peace, justice and strong institutions. Too tight a nexus can reproduce and reinforce established industry standard and practice, and hinder innovation. Looking outside the immediate industry-specific constraints can help overcome a silo mentality and enable more synergistic approaches to achieving the SDGs. We call for improvement and further organisational learning interventions that address people issues (e.g. SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8) and environmental impact (SDGs 6, 7, 13, 14, 15). Social value as a construct that embraces environmental impact and is more localised than the global SDGs appears to offer a more specific framework for practice than the SDGs given their broad scope.   4 Conclusion We present a case of transformation of an industrial and societal system in the built environment towards more sustainable production and consumption patterns, through processes of change. Social value is the national/ organisation level vehicle for realising the SDGs at the centre of our study. We have employed social practice theory to examine different stakeholders’ organisational learning journeys on social value and the achievement of the SDGs. We illustrate how interorganisational learning helps align the stakeholders’ efforts around a nexus of SDGs and thus achieve on those SDGs beyond what any individual project or initiative is able to deliver. Social value and the SDGs are about action. We show organisational learning as both a process, i.e. how the different stakeholders have developed over time in terms of social value practice, and how this links with the outcomes of the learning process: creating social value and the achievement of the SDGs. The stakeholders’ varied accounts direct attention towards a nexus of SDGs which naturally align with the nature of work and production in the built environment, most notably SDGs 11 Sustainable cities and communities, 12 Responsible consumption and production, and 17 Partnerships for the goals. We call for improvement and organisational learning interventions and action that addresses people issues and environmental impact. Social value emerges as the construct more closely relevant to organisational practice than the SDGs. Specific recommendations that can be made on the basis of our study include project team collaboration (with client, design, and construction representatives); awareness raising and engagement throughout extended supply-chains; contracting social enterprises; cross-sector engagement; incorporating social value in corporate strategic plans and in key business objectives; working with universities, schools and other learning providers; apprenticeships; in-house training, development and support with careers; targeted recruitment; flexible working; developing organisational culture; energy-efficient built-estate; and carefully assessing and measuring social value. The continued growth of global construction and infrastructure activity, which spreads across all SDGs, highlights the significant potential impact contained within this partnership approach to organisational learning.
