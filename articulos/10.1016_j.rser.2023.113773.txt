                  The scientific evidence on applications of microalgae in bioremediation of wastewaters, increasing agricultural productivity, and biomass production strengthens their potential in supporting global socio-economic and environmental sustainability. Microalgae can consume organic compounds and pollutants present in domestic, agricultural, and industrial wastewater. This leads to biomass production in wastewater and water being relatively safe to be disposed of into water bodies and safeguard life in water. The extensive diversity of microalgae, encompassing a distinct array of physiological, reproductive, and functional traits, along with their remarkable efficiency in wastewater treatment, positions this group of organisms as exceptionally superior to other organisms. Molecular and biotechnological approaches have provided promising tools for improving the biomass production of microalgae from wastewater. Recent technological innovations have facilitated harvesting algal biomass from wastewater treatment plants for developing a range of bioproducts like bioenergy, biofertilizer and other various high value biochemicals. Microalgal communities and their biomass produced from wastewater are investigated for the restoration of degraded lands. The potential use of diverse microalgal species and their biomass from wastewater for restoration of degraded lands such as salt-affected lands, drought ridden arid areas, fly ash contaminated lands, and metal-polluted mine spoils is discussed. Moreover, this review elaborates on how use of microalgae from wastewater to wastelands can contribute to various sustainable development goals (SDGs). It is found that extending microalgae research and use from wastewater to wastelands can support achieving all SDGs by directly contributing to 10 goals.

Table 4    Degraded land Specific traits or properties Ref.   Salt-affected lands One billion hectares of land in the world are salt-affected. Salt-affected soils can be divided into two major groups. (1) Saline soils: High electrical conductivity because of high soluble salts in soil water, impede the growth of plants in alkaline (saline-sodic) soil: pH > 8, Exchangeable sodium percentage >15, Sodium adsorption ratio >15, high bulk density, and low water holding capacity, stone-like hard during summer and prolonged water logging during rain. Not fit for food and herbaceous crops. (2) Sodic soils result from severe degradation in their physical structure like bulk density, clay mineralogy, water filtration, and hard calcite pan in deep soil layer due to long-term deposition of sodium salts. [170–173 ]  Arid lands 35% of the world's land is arid. Very low soil water, high temperature and evaporation, scares vegetation cover, low soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus [174 ]  Fly ash and heavy metal polluted lands Fly ash, a waste produced by thermal power plants generates electricity from coal combustion. About 750 million tons of waste is produced every year globally. Fly ash predominantly consists of silica (SiO2 ), alumina (Al2 O3 ), iron oxide (Fe2 O3 ), calcium oxide (CaO), magnesium oxide (MgO), potassium oxide (K2 O), sodium oxide (Na2 O), sulfate (SO4 ), and unburned carbon posing significant environmental (pollution of air, water, and soil) threat. [175 ]  Mine spoils Mine spoils comprise of rock fragments, subsoils materials, and an uneconomical ore mixture that occupied large pieces of land during disposal. Mine spoils are nutrient deficient, lack soil structure and functions, and exhibit adverse physicochemical properties that inhibit plant growth.

The scientific evidence on applications of microalgae in bioremediation of wastewaters, increasing agricultural productivity, and biomass production strengthens their potential in supporting global socio-economic and environmental sustainability. Microalgae can consume organic compounds and pollutants present in domestic, agricultural, and industrial wastewater. This leads to biomass production in wastewater and water being relatively safe to be disposed of into water bodies and safeguard life in water. The extensive diversity of microalgae, encompassing a distinct array of physiological, reproductive, and functional traits, along with their remarkable efficiency in wastewater treatment, positions this group of organisms as exceptionally superior to other organisms. Molecular and biotechnological approaches have provided promising tools for improving the biomass production of microalgae from wastewater. Recent technological innovations have facilitated harvesting algal biomass from wastewater treatment plants for developing a range of bioproducts like bioenergy, biofertilizer and other various high value biochemicals. Microalgal communities and their biomass produced from wastewater are investigated for the restoration of degraded lands. The potential use of diverse microalgal species and their biomass from wastewater for restoration of degraded lands such as salt-affected lands, drought ridden arid areas, fly ash contaminated lands, and metal-polluted mine spoils is discussed. Moreover, this review elaborates on how use of microalgae from wastewater to wastelands can contribute to various sustainable development goals (SDGs). It is found that extending microalgae research and use from wastewater to wastelands can support achieving all SDGs by directly contributing to 10 goals.

Water pollution is the most important concern in the present world, with a current population of about 8 billion [3 ]. A quarter of the global population is already living in water deficit conditions, and under business-as-usual scenarios will further result in losing targets related to sustainable development goal 6 (SDG-6) by a large margin. Over 40% of the global population is expected to dwell in extremely water-stressed regions by 2035 [4 ,5 ]. That becomes a major challenge in achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) associated with water (SDG 6, 14, and 15). Critical climate-driven water scarcities will intensify in countries around mid-latitudes such as north Africa, southern Texas, China, north Chile, Argentina, and South Africa [6 ]. Lack of sufficient water to fulfil potable water demands and sanitation requirements is certainly a limitation for human well-being, economic growth, conservation of a clean environment, and healthy ecosystems [7 ]. Further, water quality degradation due to domestic, agricultural, and industrial wastes is a severe environmental and socio-economic challenge [8 ]. Therefore, maintaining water quality while concurrently developing cost-effective and eco-friendly technologies for wastewater remediation is urgently needed. Although various wastewater treatment processes make it possible to remediate the physical impurities in wastewaters [9 ], however energy intensive [10 ], for a biological breakdown of complex organic and inorganic pollutants [11 ,12 ] it relies on microorganisms. Given their various relevant morpho-physiological traits and diverse habitat preferences, microalgae have the potential to deepen sustainable remediation and treatment of different wastewaters (sections 2 and 3 ). Microalgae is a diverse group of unicellular eukaryotic photosynthetic algae and prokaryotic cyanobacteria [13 ]. As an effective biological tool to remediate wastewater, microalgae have gained momentum in current global research and policy initiatives [9 ]. It has been demonstrated that microalgae can consume organic and inorganic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, organic pollutants, and heavy metals present in domestic and industrial wastewater. This, in turn, makes the water relatively safe to be disposed of into water bodies (lakes, rivers, oceans, etc.) [14 ]. Recently, Mohsenpour and colleagues demonstrated how integrating microalgae in wastewater treatment could substantially enhance the removal of various organic and inorganic carbon and inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus [9 ]. In addition, the cost-effectiveness of microalgae to be used in wastewater treatment and their CO2  sequestration abilities received more attention from scientific, industrial and political communities [15 ,16 ]. A few recent studies, pertinent to the use of consortium of microalgae and bacteria and/or cyanobacteria, also show that various interactions (positive, negative and neutral) between these organisms facilitate the process of wastewater remediation via enhanced sequestration of nutrients [17–19 ] (section 4 ). The recent technological innovations have facilitated harvesting algal biomass from wastewater treatment plants for developing an array of bioproducts like bioenergy, high value biochemicals, etc. [20 ]. Fabris and colleagues illustrate how recent technical advancement, emerging fields of applications and diversity of products through algal biotechnology could help to develop high-tech, low-cost, and ecologically friendly products and services for many needs of human society [20 ]. Molecular and biotechnological approaches have provided promising tools for improving the biomass production of microalgae from wastewater, which are crucial for scaling up the bioenergy industry [21 ,22 ]. Further, rapid development of genetic engineering tools enabled the increased availability of whole genome sequences of various microalgae. The genetic manipulation or alteration of microalgae is already optimized for several species. Microalgal biomass produced from domestic and industrial wastewater is used for bioenergy generation, agriculture, soil fertility and health management [23–26 ]. Alike water, a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors, including land development, overexploitation, species translocations and introductions, and pollution, has contributed to the acceleration of land degradation in the 21st century. The expansion of agriculture, urbanization, cattle ranching, mining for fossil fuels, and deforestation are among the leading anthropogenic factors of land degradation and biodiversity loss. Collectively, these are responsible for social, economic, and environmental devastation as well as human suffering. Restoration is a scientifically proven and economical option to halt and reverse environmental degradation. Global conventions and agencies have committed to restoring one billion hectares of degraded lands by 2030 [27 ]. These restoration techniques can include several biological tools such as selective plantation, microorganisms, soil amendments, and reforestation. One of the emerging nature-based restoration tools is microalgae [26 ,28 ]. A great deal of studies, however, primarily from lab-scale experiments, have explored the possibilities of using microalgae as biofertilizers, biocontrol, and biopesticides [26 ,28–30 ]. In agriculture, microalgae improve soil health and enhance crop productivity through nutrient availability and plant protection from pathogens [31 ,32 ]. Microalgae, particularly cyanobacteria, play a key role in increasing the fertility of nitrogen deficient agricultural lands through atmospheric nitrogen fixation [33 ]. Despite these important roles of microalgae in land restoration and recent research developments, there is a lack of a systematic review on how microalgae can help in solving the pressing and intertwined challenges associated with water and land (section 5 ). Soil and water are closely linked and critical for the entire life on earth. Their restoration, therefore, can substantially contribute to realization of various Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [34–36 ]. Restoring land only can ensure achieving 13 of SDGs [37 ]. In this context, microalgae are biological resources for potential water and land restoration research and for achieving SDGs (section 6 ). Despite sizable independent studies on wastewater and wasteland research pertinent to microalgae, critical expert insights to use microalgae in wastewater treatment, restoration of degraded lands, and using their potential in achieving and localizing UN SDGs have been a major gap. Therefore, this article aims to fill that gap by providing insights on diverse microalgal traits and their potential role in wastewater treatment. This article also demonstrates the potential of microalgae in wasteland restoration and achieving the UN SDGs. This paper has seven sections. Section 1  introduces the background and contextualizes the aim of this article. Section 2  addresses a fundamental question in microalgae research, i.e., why microalgae? This section lists highly researched microalgae and describes traits that make them ecologically and biologically appropriate candidates for remediation of wastewaters, wastelands, and value addition through different bioproducts. How microalgae can be a better biological resource than other organisms is addressed in section 3 . In addition to illustrating the primary mechanism of wastewater treatment, Section 4  briefly but critically reviews the effectiveness of microalgae for the remediation of wastewater originating from different sources. Section 5  presents insights on possible fundamental mechanisms of wasteland restoration by using microalgal biomass that can play a crucial role in managing salt-affected soils, drought affected arid and semi-arid areas, fly ash dumping sites, heavy metal contaminated lands, and mine spoils. Section 6  reflects possibilities of mainstreaming microalgal research in sustainable land restoration as a cost-effective approach for the realization of relevant UN SDGs, while Section 7  enlists key research gaps and constraining conditions associated with microalgal research and its application in sustainable land and water restoration.  2 Why microalgae? Microalgae are a highly diverse group of unicellular photosynthetic prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms [13 ,38 ]. Microalgae are considered sunlight-driven cell factories which can convert carbon dioxide into potential foods for human and animal consumption [39 ], and various types of renewable biofuels such as methane [39 ], biodiesel [40 ], and biohydrogen [41 ]. Microalgae are also important in biotechnological research due to their diversity, CO2  fixation capacity, and high biomass production capacity with lipid productivity for third generation biofuels [42 ]. Microalgae, either prokaryotic or eukaryotic are important to produce biofuel and many other byproducts (biochemicals, bioenergies, biohydrogen, etc.). Many companies are engaged in the mass cultivation of microalgae on a commercial scale and helping for the establishment of biobased economies [43 ]. The prokaryotic microalgae are also known as blue-green algae and cyanobacteria belong to the Cyanophyceae class (microalgae from this division can only fix atmospheric nitrogen independently and in association with other organisms). All eukaryotic microalgae are kept in other divisions of algal taxonomic classification i.e., Chlorophyceae (green algae), Phaeophyceae (brown algae), Rhodophyceae (red algae) and Bacillariophyceae (diatoms) (Fig. 1  ) [38 ]. With a distinct pool of morphological and physiological traits and growth behavior, this group has immense potential to resolve various complex environmental and socio-economic challenges (Table 1  ). Earlier studies have tested several microalgal species for bioenergy production and development of industrially relevant bioproducts while remediation of wastewater discharged from various domestic [44 ], agricultural [45 ], and industrial activities [9 ]. Empirical and long-term studies have identified various microalgae abundantly growing in sewage, particularly Chlorophyceae, as a dominant group in diversity and frequency compared to other classes, i.e., Cyanophyceae, Bacillariophyceae and Phaeophyceae [46 ,47 ]. Since the microalgae have been recognized and emerged as an ecofriendly tool for bioremediation of wastewater and bioenergy production [48–50 ], Chlorella , Scenedesmus , Chlamydomonas , Stigeoclonium  (green algae), Oscillatoria  (cyanobacteria), Euglena  (Euglenophyta), Nitzschia , and Navicula  (Bacillariophyta) and their different species are highly investigated [51–53 ] (see Fig. 1 ). Previous studies also have used microalgae (living species, suspension, and biomass), mainly in greenhouse, pots, and laboratory experiments, to test their practical applicability in agriculture [26 ,28 ,29 ]. A significant proportion of this research has been on cyanobacteria as biofertilizers, plant growth promoters, and biopesticides (applied as living cells, and fresh biomass) to increase the productivity of various crops like wheat [54–56 ], maize [57–59 ], rice [60 ], lettuce [61 ,62 ], and tomato [63 ,64 ]. The highly investigated cyanobacteria, prokaryotes, and nitrogen fixers are Nostoc muscorum , Microcystis aeruginosa , Anabaena laxa , A. azotica , A. variabilis , Calothrix elenkinii , C. ghosei , and Hapalosiphon intricatus . Soil nitrogen fixation by Cyanophyceae species enhances the growth and productivity of all the studied crops. The utilization of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, however, appears to have a more significant impact on vegetative growth than on seed production [26 ]. Microalgae have also demonstrated the abilities to solubilize phosphate, however least investigated, increasing soil carbon [65 ,66 ] and release of growth hormones [67 ,68 ]. Microalgae also produce polysaccharides, antimicrobial compounds, and other metabolites which promote plant growth and soil fertility [26 ,30 ]. Microalgae Chlorella pyrenoidosa  release plant hormone gibberellin (GA3) which improves plant growth [68 ]. Microalgae, Chlorella  lowered the transcription of cell wall degrading genes, increased carbohydrate synthesis, and prime plants to respond to stress and pathogenic attack [69 ]. However, auxins (growth hormones) released by microalgae Neochloris aquatica  negatively affected the cell elongation, and root development of Arabidopsis  thaliana and Lemma  sp [67 ]. The combined use of C. pyrenoidosa  (release GA3) and nitrogen fixing Azotobacter beijerinckii  increased wheat yield in salt-affected soil [70 ]. The antimicrobial activity and bioactive compounds of two species of Chlorella  and one of Scenedesmus  were recently reported. Various compounds such as phenol (18.5%), hexadecenoic acid (18.25%), phytol (14.43%), 9,12-octadecadienoic acid (13.69%), and bicycloheptane (7.23%) those possess antimicrobial activities were also isolated from these microalgae species [71 ]. Several species of microalgae have been tested for their effectiveness in stress release and improving nutrient uptake, secondary metabolites and defence mechanism [26 ]. Comparatively, a few studies investigated the potential impacts of dry cyanobacterial microalgal biomass on food crops [56 ,61 ,72 ,73 ]. The eukaryotic green and red microalgal species proved to be effective in agricultural applications are C . fusca , C. vulgaris  (live cells and dry biomass as well; [61 ,74 ], Acutodesmus dimorphus  (live cells only [63 ]), Nannochloropsis oculata  [72 ], Dunaliella salina  [59 ], and Porphyridium  sp. [75 ] applied both as living cell suspension and dry biomass with different aims such as soil conditioner, for erosion control, and also for increasing soil fertility and productivity of selected crops. The above sections clearly indicate that microalgae possess the ability to effectively treat wastewater due to their capacity to absorb and remove nutrients and contaminants from the water [15 ,49 ,52 ,53 ,76–82 ]. This includes nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus, which are common pollutants in wastewater and can lead to environmental problems if not properly managed. Additionally, microalgae can be harnessed for agricultural purposes, as they can serve as a nutrient source for crops and enhance soil fertility [26 ,30 ]. When microalgae are cultivated to treat wastewater, there is an additional advantage to extract energy compounds. Through photosynthesis microalgae can accumulate energy-rich compounds like lipids and carbohydrates. These compounds can be harvested and processed to create biofuels or other forms of renewable energy, contributing to sustainability efforts, and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Microalgae cultivated in wastewater can also be used to enhance soil fertility and boost crop yields. Microalgae communities and specific species have exhibited promise beyond wastewater treatment and agriculture. They have demonstrated potential in addressing a range of environmental issues. For example, microalgae can be used to restore degraded lands by contributing nutrients and organic matter to rejuvenate the soil. The biomass of microalgae, especially after extracting lipids for energy purposes, remains rich in valuable nutrients such as organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus, and micronutrients. This biomass can be utilized to rehabilitate degraded lands, as it provides essential nutrients and organic material that promote soil health and fertility [29 ,83–85 ]. Therefore, microalgae ultimately aiding in the restoration of degraded wastelands, wastewater, and realization of various sustainable development goals.  3 How are microalgae better than other organisms? Microalgae are the easiest resource that can convert the carbon dioxide into potential food materials not only for humans but also for animal consumption [39 ]. Its biomass can be converted into various types of renewable biofuels such as methane [39 ], biodiesel, and biohydrogen [40 ]. The biological sequestration of CO2  by microalgae contributes to net-zero emissions targets without any interference with agriculture [87 ]. Microalgae can be cultivated without major agronomic inputs and land sharing with other important food crops. Compared with traditional crops, microalgae don't need herbicides or pesticides, have no requirements on land conditions, and are not restricted by seasons [88 ]. Microalgae are organisms with the highest photosynthetic efficiency in nature, can grow rapidly and generate large amounts of biomass on land not achievable via traditional agriculture [89 ]. The photosynthetic efficiency of microalgae is 10–20% higher than most of the terrestrial plants [90 ]. Microalgae with 30000 to more than 1 million species is considered an untapped biological wealth for economic and ecological benefits. A recent study reviewed that only 15 species so far have been tested for wastewater treatment and commercially cultivated at large scale [76 ]. Microalgae are exceptional for water remediation because a broad range of toxic and other wastes can be remedied using microalgae. Pollutants can be used as nutrients and degraded enzymatically by microalgae [91 ,92 ]. Microalgae are fast-growing aquatic organisms that exist naturally in various habitats and throughout the entire oceanic ecosystem, including in freshwater and saline water ecosystems [92–94 ]. They can also grow in different environments such as saltwater, freshwater, and wastewater [91 ]. The phyco-remediation process is inherent to the algal metabolism, nevertheless, the removal of pollutants will be variable according to different microalgae used and wastewater characteristics [95 ]. The water footprint in bioenergy is a challenge since increased bioenergy production will require more water and lead issues with water scarcity. But microalgal bioenergy shows less water footprint compared to other bioenergy sources [96 ]. For example, the water footprint of biodiesel from microalga Chlorella vulgaris  was reported to be 3726 kg-water/kg-biodiesel [96 ]. This can be reduced significantly in the case of water recycling or selecting algal strains, such as Chaetoceros gracilis , Cyclotella cryptica , and Nannochloropsis  sp. from a marine environment that show high growth rates and lipid contents. Generally, large scale production of biomass requires a large area of land, but in case of microalgae, it can be possible to cultivate it in an offshore environment by using transparent polymer films such as polyethylene or polyurethane [97 ]. Therefore, microalgae from wastewater offer various advantages for land restoration compared to other organic amendments such as green manuring, farmyard manures, bioenergy crops and tree plantations in the sense that it brings multiple environmental benefits. As discussed above, fast growth (high growth rates and reproductive capacity), nutrient cycling (N & P), soil improvement (organic matter; see section 5 ), biomass production (biofuels, livestock feed, and bioactive compounds), adaptability (grow in diverse environment), carbon sequestration (photosynthetic), minimum competition and low water requirements (typically require less water than plants in restoration projects) are key features on microalgae show this group is better than other organisms and methods to restore both water and land. However, despite their advantages, it is important to consider potential challenges and limitations associated with the use of microalgae. For instance, microalgae may not provide that much of sufficient biomass needed for land restoration and the same level of aesthetic and habitat value offered by plant-based restoration of degraded lands.  4 Wastewater remediation with microalgae Water discharged from various domestic, agricultural, industrial (e.g., beverage), piggery, and dairy activities, in addition to physical impurities (color, odor, turbidity, solids), remains polluted because of a high load of nutrients like C, N, P, salts (sodium, calcium, etc.), alkalinity, heavy metals, with high chemical and biochemical oxygen demand (COD & BOD) and very low microbial population. In addition, depending on the cause of the pollution, wastewater remains polluted with various physical impurities such as plastics, glass, rocks, iron, etc. For biological remediation of wastewater, purified at primary and/or secondary clarifiers, is treated with individual microalgae species and their communities [98 ]. Several species have been tested for their potential for bio-accumulation and degradation of organic and inorganic pollutants from wastewaters originating from a myriad of industrial and domestic activities [76 ]. Three species of Chlorella , i.e., C. pyrenoidosa , C. vulgaris , C. protothecoides  and two species of Scenedesmus , i.e., S. obliquus  and S. dimorphus  are the most effective reported in the removal of various pollutants from a range of wastewaters (Table 2  ). Microalgae can carry out the conversion of inorganic N into organic forms via assimilation. It takes place via the reduction of nitrate (NO3 ) to nitrite (NO2 ) and to ammonium (NH4 ), which is integrated into amino acids. Microalgae also provide molecular oxygen as an oxidizing agent for bacterial oxidation, thereby lowering BOD and COD in wastewater. Microorganisms present in wastewater consume dissolved oxygen released by microalgae during algae-bacterial interaction. Heavy metal uptake by microalgae occurs in two ways: (i) passive biosorption by dead biomass (ii) active biosorption by living microalgae cells. Metal ions in the cationic form are adsorbed on the cell surface of microalgae having functional groups like hydroxyl (-OH), carboxyl (-COOH), amino (-NH2 ), and sulfhydryl (-SH). However, during the active biosorption process, metal ions are translocated across the cell membrane to the cytoplasm [99 ]. Microalgae are also capable of assimilating a wide range of organic pollutants as an energy source for their growth in wastewater via biosorption and biodegradation [100 ]. 4.1 Remediation of domestic wastewater Biological remediation of wastewater, a secondary process after removal of physical impurities, is an important component of cleaning wastewater generated from households including kitchen, bathroom, laundry, and other domestic large-scale activities. Various studies at lab-scale and pilot-scale demonstrated the effectiveness of microalgae to remediated domestic wastewater. Gouveia et al. [114 ] and Li et al. [115 ] reported the removal of 3–8 mg/L P and 37–119 mg L−1  N at the primary stage and 0.5–6.1 mg/L P and 0.8–6.9 mg L−1  N at the secondary phase from city wastewater by C. vulgaris . The same species were also reported to effectively reduce total N, total P and BOD by 82%, 88%, and 57%, respectively from brewery effluent [116 ]. Ankistrodesmus falcatus, with the highest efficiency, S. obliquus , and C. sorokiniana  showed their capabilities to remove  86.45–98.21% ammonia,  75.76–80.85% nitrate and  98.52–100% phosphate, respectively from  aquaculture wastewater [102 ]. A study by Gupta et al. [44 ] showed the removal of N, P, and COD from domestic wastewater by 86.93%, 68.24% and 69.38% by C. sorokiniana  and 98.54%, 97.99%, and 98.54% by S. obliquus.  Both species efficiently removed coliforms and faecal coliforms (99–100%). A comprehensive evaluation of the treatment potential of both species revealed that C. sorokiniana  has better stress tolerance in varying nutrient loading conditions than S. obliquus.  The findings of this study clearly demonstrated the applicability of algal technologies for wastewater treatment and the production of biomass for biofuels from wastewater. Microalgae are known for high concentrations of various nutrients and compounds such as lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, proteins, and carbohydrates. The composition of these compounds in microalgae can vary depending on species, growth conditions, level of pollution in wastewater and other factors (Table 3  ). Microalgae biomass harvested from different wastewaters can be converted to different forms of bioenergies such as bioethanol, biogas, biodiesel and biohydrogen [117 ]. Various studies showed comparably better bioremediation potential of consortia of bacteria and microalgae than the monoculture of either any of the microalgae or bacterial species. It has been established that microalgae or bacteria monocultures are very susceptible to various contaminants as well as aquatic stressors. However, the remediation improves synergistically by several folds if those species are co-cultivated. One of the fascinating recent studies demonstrated the growth of Chlorella  sp. diminishes due to oxidative stresses when its monoculture was exposed to 100 mg/L As(III) [126 ]. However, the stress is well tolerated when the same sp. is co-cultivated with an arsenic-oxidizing bacteria, Pseudomonas  sp. (SMS 11 strain). The study's findings demonstrated that Pseudomonas  sp. efficiently reduced the oxidation potential by methylation of AS (III) to less toxic As(V). It has also been established that most bacterial species have excellent potential to oxidize As(III) but do not possess respective genes. However, when co-cultivated with microalgae, it is provided by algae, and thus remediation of arsenic increases several folds synergistically [127 ]. Various mono or mixed cultures of microalgae or microalgae with cyanobacteria/bacteria/fungi, have also been reported for biomass production and carbon (organic and inorganic) sequestration from wastewaters [128 ]. Such findings demonstrate that various species can be co-cultivated depending upon the need for value-added end products or bioremediation purposes [129 ]. Autotrophic and mixotrophic cultivation approaches are also widely employed for the sequestration of various organic and inorganic contaminates, phosphorus, and nitrogen from various strength wastewater, including industrial effluents and biomass production, simultaneously. The presence of emerging contaminants in aquatic systems is also one of the major challenges nowadays. Recent studies have demonstrated excellent bioremediation potential of microalgal species and their various strains such as Rhodomonas  sp., Scenedesmus quadricuda , Selenastrum  sp., Haematococcus pluvialis , Phormidium  sp, Anabaena  sp, Chlamydomonas  sp., Coelastrella  sp., Chlorella  sp., Desmodesmus  sp., Nannochloropsis  sp., Nostoc  sp., Spirulina  sp., and Picocystis  sp. can efficiently remove persistent organic contaminants, including emerging contaminants [130 ]. These algal species are reported to remove from 40 to 100% of pharmaceuticals such as Estriol, Ciprofloxacin, Tetracycline, Chlortetracycline, Paracetamol, Diclofenac, Ibuprofen; 75–99% pesticide Lindane, Malathion, and dyes such as Rhodamine B, Remazol black B, Acenaphthylene, Fluoranthene, Acid black 210, Congo red, Bisphenol A, Naproxen, and Salicylate. The principal mechanisms of algal removal of these pharmaceuticals involve surface adsorption, bioaccumulation, or biodegradation [130–132 ].  4.2 Remediation of agricultural wastewater Agricultural sectors release large amount of effluent characterized by having high nutrient load and toxic chemicals that can also be consumed by microalgae. The availability of nutrients as well as the components and solubility of those nutrients in palm oil mill effluent was assessed by Ahmed et al. [133 ]. The palm oil mill effluent contained high levels of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) and 80% of C and N along with 72% of P were available for microalgae assimilation. Native and commercial strains of Chlorella sorokiniana  produced comparable biomass in this effluent and high concentration of nutrient in POME may be a reason [134 ]. This study suggest that agricultural wastewater may be a suitable option for microalgae cultivation leading to the production of valuable biomass. In another study, Chlorella  and Coelastrella  sp., were also studied for the bioremediation of diluted POME and the highest conversion of NH4 -nitrogen, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus were 100%, 65%, and 56%, respectively [135 ]. As Chlorella sorokiniana  was grown in dairy wastes, its biomass had a protein content of 28.6–52.8% [80 ]. Microalgae could be grown in dairy wastewater, however, microalgal co-cultivation with bacteria provides better bioremediation of the wastewater [136 ]. Chlorella sp also showed bioremediation of soybean processing wastewater and CO2  fixation from a simulated flue gas [137 ]. Scenedesmus obliquus  and Aurantiochytrium  (Schizochytrium ) sp. were grown heterotrophically in soybean processing water to produce lipid-rich and DHA-rich biomass [138 ,139 ]. Besides, cultivation of Spirulina  sp. in swine wastewater and Chlorella pyrenoidosa  in poultry wastewater resulted in 1280 and 2520 mg/L biomass along with 80% TN recovery [140 ,141 ]. Arthrospira  sp. and Chlorella  sp., can be cultivated in live-stock wastewater to produce protein-rich biomass as ingredients of animal and fish feeds [142 ].  4.3 Remediation of industrial wastewater Heavy metals (HMs) are often present in industrial effluents and due to their non-biodegradable properties, abundant sources, toxicity, and accumulative behavior, HMs pollution is a critical problem worldwide. Chemical, physical, and biological approaches are the three remediation techniques for removing HMs from wastewater using various types of microalgae [143 ]. The basic mechanism of HMs remediation by microalgae is that the amino, hydroxyl, carboxyl, and sulfate functional groups found in microalgal cell walls are the principal binding sites for the HMs. Microalgae are the most common species successfully used to remove various HMs from wastewater. Biosorption of various HMs like Cr, Cd, Pb, Ni and As has been demonstrated by various microalgae [76 ,144 ,145 ]. Dyes discharged into aquatic ecosystems cause serious environmental challenges. Algal cell walls contain a variety of functional groups that aid in the dye removal process. Microalgal absorption of dyes has several advantages, including being a simple environmentally benign process, having a high adsorption efficiency, utilizing readily available materials, and being inexpensive. Microalgae have shown the potential to remove various types of dyes in several studies [146 ]. Microalgae such as Chlorella vulgaris  have been found highly efficient for the removal of dyes [147 ]. The ability of mixotrophic microalgae to extract and absorb pharmaceutical compounds from wastewater has been reported using a variety of microalgal species [148 ,149 ]. Mechanisms underlying the removal of various pharmaceutical compounds by microalgae depend on physicochemical properties  of the targeted compound. The presence of carboxyl, hydroxyl, and phosphoryl  functional groups are responsible for microalgae being predominately negatively charged, which turned out to be favourable for capturing positively charged pharmaceutical molecules [150 ]. Besides nutrients and organic substances, removal of pathogens from wastewater also needs urgent attention. Microalgae show a promising way for removal of pathogenic microorganisms and their inactivation via various mechanisms like nutrient competition, pH elevation and oxygenation , attachment and sedimentation , and microalgal toxins [151 ].   5 Microalgae for restoration of degraded lands The microalgae grown in wastewater can be used directly (either as whole biomass or as lipid-extracted biomass, LEB) and indirectly (biofertilizers) for restoring degraded lands such as salt-affected lands [152 ,153 ], mine spoils [154 ,155 ], arid lands [156–160 ], and heavy metal polluted lands [29 ,161 ]. In addition, different forms of microalgae can be helpful in enhancing the fertility of degraded soils [162 ]. The main aim of restoring any degraded land is to increase desirable traits of the soil, like fertility and allied properties and decrease in undesirable traits, such as structural damage, chemical imbalance, and biological soil sickness, through various effective and sustainable means. The restoration efficacy of used amendments depends on two major factors (i) the chemistry of the amendment used and (ii) physical, chemical, and biological status of land being treated (Table 4  ). The direction and magnitude of change in quality of the degraded land with possible effects of microalgae biomass, LEB, and biofertilizers can be explained by estimating the increase in traits that make land healthy and decrease in traits that make land unfit for cultivation [163 ]. Mechanistically, change in soil physical properties due to application of microalgae has a great influence on soil's chemical and biological properties and vice versa (Fig. 2  ). For instance, an increase in soil flocculation due to microalgae secreted exopolysaccharides [159 ] improves soil aggregate stability, and infiltration rate [164 ]. The moment of water molecules takes excess salts (Na+ , K+ , Ca++ ), other pollutants and CO2  released by microbial activities, from the soil solution in the surface layers to the deeper depth [165 ]. This decrease in soil electrical conductivity increases soil biological activities and nutrient mineralization through microbial decomposition [166 ] of microalgae biomass [167 ,168 ]. Decline in soil stress with microalgae application increases the fraction of biological carbon (ratio of microbial biomass to organic carbon; also known as microbial quotient). This decreases the fraction of CO2  emission per unit of microbial biomass (also known as metabolic quotient) [166 ,168 ]. The microbial metabolic quotient is the rate of soil microbial respiration per unit of microbial biomass. It represents the capacity of soil microbes to utilize soil organic matter [169 ]. Microbial metabolic efficiency declines with increasing stress, and this is indicated by increasing metabolic quotients (microbial respiration per unit biomass, q CO2). Microbial metabolic quotient (q CO2) is an important soil health indicator to measure microbial C use efficiency. Soil carbon sequestration can be enhanced by increasing soil microbial biomass and C use efficiency, ultimately improving soil health [166 ]. As demonstrated in earlier studies, microbial biomass and biofertilizers quickly and remarkably change a broad spectrum of extracellular and intracellular soil enzymes that are involved in the degradation of organic matter and the mineralization of nutrients, including dehydrogenase, β-glucosidase, phosphatase, urease, peroxidase, etc. Application of microalgae, cyanobacteria and their biomass can substantially soil biological health through promoting nitrogen fixation, cycling of nutrients, and plant growth promotion. The impact of microalgae biomass, live cells and consortium of both microalgae and bacteria on soil microbial activities and soil biodiversity has been less investigated during restoration of degraded lands [26 ]. However, the following sections discuss the possible impacts of microalgae application on soil microbial and enzymatic activities in degraded lands. 5.1 Microalgae for restoring salt-affected soils Restoration of salt-affected lands (for basic properties please see Table 3 ) may potentially be successful if degradation in its physical, chemical, and biological properties can be reversed to the level needed for highly productive agriculture, forestry and agroforestry [178–180 ]. The application of cyanobacteria as a biofertilizer not only increases nitrogen and phosphorus concentration through solubilizing inorganic phosphorus (generally available in high concentration in high pH soils [181 ]) but also helps to reduce pH, while improving soil physical stability and cation exchange balance [172 ]. Recent reviews provide a state-of-the-art understanding of the application of prokaryotic cyanobacteria as an appropriate ecological candidate and as a nature-based solution for the reclamation of salt-affected lands [152 ,182 ]. Application of biofertilizer produced from two cyanobacterial species (Nostoc ellipsosporum  HH-205 and Nostoc punctiforme  HH-206) on salt affected soil shows a substantial increase in total nitrogen (7–16%), and crop yield (52%) under wheat crop after 240 days and total organic carbon (32–36%), available phosphorus (17%) and crop yield (31%) under pearl millet crop compared to untreated salt affected soil. Researchers assessed the effectiveness of eukaryotic microalgae, their live species, dry and fresh biomass, and products in restoring salt-affected lands. For instances, the live cells of Chlorella vulgaris  and C. pyrenoidosa  were tested under laboratory conditions for their stress tolerance ability with increasing soil salinity levels [183 ]. C. vulgaris  survived at a high soil-salinity level (1% NaCl) with 0.8 million cells per mL of soil suspension. In another study, Barone et al. [184 ] reported a significant increase in various enzyme activities of saline soil with the effect of applying live cells of C. vulgaris  and Scenedesmus quadricauda . Treatment of tomato plant with 1%, 5% and 10% of cyanobacteria-microalgae extract formulations at soil salinity of 80 mM NaCl show 22%, 18% and 22% increase in shoot length and 70%, 54% and 53% increase in shoot weight, respectively [185 ]. The algal fresh and dry biomass has been applied in salt-affected soils as slow-release fertilizers, easily degradable by microorganisms and it can provide nutrients to plants for a prolonged time [186–188 ]. Hence, the synergistic application of microalgae biomass with other microbial groups, and amendments can be more effective in management of salt-affected lands. Al-Maliki and Al-Masaudi [189 ] reported a higher increase in soil organic carbon, microbial biomass and enzymes in saline soils combinedly treated with microalgae biomass, mycorrhizal fungi, and plant biomass in comparison to soil treated independently with all these amendments. They reported a 55% increase in microbial activity and 54% increase in grain yield at salt affected soil treated with algal biomass compared to control.  5.2 Microalgae for restoring arid and semi-arid lands (drought/rainfed/deserts) Land use alterations and continuous changes in environmental conditions led to large-scale land destruction. Extreme environmental events such as drought, sandstorms, heatwaves, and floods result in the loss of ecological functions mainly due to their negative impact on vegetation and soil fertility. Therefore, effective restoration strategies are needed to combat land degradation and environmental disturbance. Prolonged moisture availability in deserts and arid lands can ensure the regeneration of local vegetation and enhance soil fertility and stability [190 ]. Microalgae biomass rich in water, organic matter and such organic compounds principally exopolysaccharides [157 ,159 ], which bind soil particles and enhance soil's water holding/retention capacity can play a critical role in effectively restoring such lands [26 ]. The development of biological soil crust, a fertile layer of soil that facilitates the succession of pioneer species with microalgae application, has been a promising technology for the restoration of deserts [191 ]. Recent studies reported a significant increase in water holding capacity and aggregate stability of desert and arid lands with the effect of microalgae and their biomass application [157 ,158 ,164 ]. The applied mixture of microalgae species (Microcoleus vaginatus  and Scytonema javanicum ) improved water availability and its retention through exopolysaccharides in sandy soils [157 ]. The ecologically engineered mixture of cyanobacteria (BGA), microalgae and bacteria increase microbial carbon by 74% and greatly effective in revegetation of deserts [192 ]. But the direct application of microalgae dry biomass in arid lands may not be effective because it will blow away with warm air and may wash out with sudden water supply. Therefore, to increase the soil's moisture content and water holding capacity, alternative innovative, applicable, and economically viable options are being developed where microalgae biomass can be utilized. In this direction, the optimization of different doses of microalgae dry biomass from wastewater treatment plants with agrimats (developed through various crop residues, farm yard wastes, sludge, bagasse, etc.) is under process [193 ,194 ]. The preliminary data show a significant decrease in soil erosion (>90%), reduced weed growth up to 10-fold, increase in soil fertility, moisture (>70%), and crop yield with microalgae biomass amended agrimats in drylands of Japan and South Africa. These experimental studies show that microalgae application is vital in moisture retention and restoration of arid and semi-arid land. More research is required to develop a package of practicing microalgae to restore arid lands. The major challenge is the cultivation of microalgae in arid conditions, however, rainwater harvesting techniques can help to design water reservoirs and constructed wetlands for microalgal cultivation [195 ]. The key practice in restoring arid land is prolonged water retention, checking erosion, and halting further desertification. Scientific studies in agricultural settings clearly indicate that microalgae improves soil physical properties such as water holding capacity and aggregate stability, which is a prerequisite in arid lands [30 ]. Commencing restoration on a small area of arid land and developing several islands can facilitate restoration in the surrounding areas. Restored land, likely to have better moisture and fertility, can be sifted for other agricultural activities to make this venture socio-economically sustainable.  5.3 Microalgae for restoring fly ash (FA) and heavy metal (HM) polluted lands Coal-based thermal power stations across the globe are a major source of electricity generation. In addition to various environmental threats of coal combustion, these power stations produce plenty of solid waste, i.e., fly ash (FA) [175 ]. Unmanaged dump sites of FA are unprecedented, affecting air, water, and soil through FA dust with suspended particulate matter and heavy metals (lead, Pb; arsenic, As; mercury, Hg; cobalt, Co; nickel, Ni; cadmium, Cd; chromium, Cr, etc.) toxicity in its leachate [196 ]. Recently, bioremediation of FA with microalgae has emerged as an innovative approach for the remediation of air, soil and water contaminants and toxins [197 ,198 ]. Furthermore, microalgae with specific cell surface, proteins and polysaccharides can effectively be used as a chelating agent to remove heavy metals (HM) from FA and other HM-polluted lands (Table 4 ). The laboratory experiments indicate that microalgae (blue-green algae) application can enhance the binding of fly ash particles and fertility through biomass decomposition in the rice field [199 ]. Growing microalgae on FA dumpsites can ensure the fixation of HMs within dumpsites through a prolific network of filamentous algal species like Trobonema sp. and prevent the leaching of HM into wetlands and lowlands around dumpsites [200 ]. Heavy metal remediation by microalgae can be achieved via two pathways [210 ]. The first pathway involves a passive extracellular uptake via biosorption, which is attained by binding HMs to negatively charged microalgae cell walls, their subsequent interaction with the cell surface and with the extracellular polymeric substances produced by microalgae (nucleic acid, lipids, proteins, sugars, etc.). In the second pathway, HM remediation by microalgae is achieved by metal transporters and detoxification of HMs by phytochelatins and metallothioneins [211 ]. Microalgae have been extensively studied for the removal of Zn, Cd, Pb, Cu, As, Hg, and Au from aqueous streams (Table 5  ) [212–215 ]. Various recent findings have shown their feasibility for HM remediation (with a removal efficiency of up to 90%) from industrial wastewaters such as tannery, textile, electroplating, agro-based industries etc. [216–219 ]. Nevertheless, biosorption activity (%) of different genera such as Scenedesmus  (65–98%), Phormidium  (80%), Oscillatoria  (90%), and Anaebaena  (65%) were found highly effective for HM remediation from tannery effluent [219 ,220 ]. These groups are also highly investigated for other aqueous and stream wastewaters [221 ]. Since microalgae-based bioremediation of HMs does not cause secondary pollution, it can be further lead to the production of biofuel, fertilizer, medicine, and health supplements [222 ]. However, microalgae-based remediation also has certain limitations such as microbial contamination, high nutrient demand, harvesting issues, and downstream processing. Therefore, further research is required in genetic engineering, development of microalgae-bacterial consortium, designing microalgae biomass-based nanomaterials, surface appropriate pre-treatment steps, and chemical modification of microalgae biomass to improve the HM removal efficiency and it will lead to phycoremediation to be applied on a larger scale.  5.4 Microalgae for restoring mine lands Surface mining activities are essential to fulfill the energy demands of the growing population. However, surface mining cleared large pieces of land to excavate minerals of interest from the lithosphere, resulting in ecosystem degradation, biodiversity loss, and environmental pollution [176 ]. Subsequently, the generation and dumping of mine spoil occupied large areas in the mining vicinity. Mine spoil lacks fertility, soil structure and functions, and demonstrates hostile environmental conditions that need to be restored for proper ecosystem functioning [223 ]. Strategies to restore mine spoils include physical and biological techniques such as reclamation of soil structure through regrading, chemical characteristics by fertilization, and development of soil biological activity by plantation and soil amendments [224 ]. Though the fertility of the mine spoils has primarily been restored through selective plantation, soil amendments, and microbial inoculations, information regarding the use of microalgae in mined land restoration remains scarce. In addition, limited research was performed to remediate metalliferous mine waste and treatment of acid mine drainage through microalgae species [225 ,226 ]. However, as an efficient biofertilizer, microalgal addition can play an efficient role in nitrogen-fixing, nutrient cycling, and overall accretion of soil fertility [26 ,227 ] and can be a sustainable environmental management tool to reinstate biogeochemical cycle and biomass production in mined lands. Moreover, using microalgal biomass as fertilizer can substantially increase plant growth and sequester CO2  [228 ]. Thus, fertilization of bioenergy plants and its growth on mined lands can potentially increase carbon stock above-and belowground carbon stock and help mining industries to offset carbon emissions [229 ]. Restoration of degraded land using microalgae can be implemented by treating mine substrate with microalgal strains and/or bio-priming of seeds with microalgae. Previous experimental studies and systematic reviews highlighted the role of microalgae (with or without other microorganisms) in restoring mine waste and remediation of acid mine drainage through biosorption and degradation of toxic elements [155 ,230 ]. Assessment of seed bio-primer with cyanobacteria for mine restoration in an arid region of Western Australia shows that shoot and root length of bio-primed seed increased by 54% and 57%, respectively, compared to the control [231 ]. Biocrust development on degraded lands can be a sustainable biological tool that can help improve soil nutrients and reduce erosion [85 ]. Most of the previous studies carried out to restore mine lands through the biocrust formation by microbial inoculation were demonstrated at a small scale. For example, a combined application of native microalgae species (Coelastrella  sp.) along with two fungi helps to form biological crusts at copper mine tailing sand. It increases SOC, microbial biomass carbon, and soil moisture by 55%, 6% and 216%, respectively [232 ].  In addition, inoculating cyanobacteria in mine soil improves biocrust cover by 31–40% and a threefold increase in SOC concentration after three months of inoculation [165 ]. Large-scale production of microalgae at affordable cost is needed to restore large patches of land destroyed by mining activities. But the recovery of microalgae biomass is a cost-effective method with various value-added products and ecosystem services. Through analysis of heterocystous cyanobacteria growth in mine substrate, it has been well established that agriculture fertilizer can be utilized to generate substantial amounts of algal biomass for dryland restoration and to induce biocrust [83 ]. It has been demonstrated that producing high-quality biocrust biomass can also be accomplished by increasing the frequency of wetting events, reducing sunlight by 60%, and inoculating with slurry. Biocrust-forming cyanobacteria grown in 1.75 m2  of biocrust inoculant can be used to treat 6000 m2  of degraded dryland at the rate of 1–5% [85 ]. A recent study reported improvement in soil pH, carbon content and enzyme activities with microalgal inoculation, a combination of Desmodesmus  sp. and Heterochlorella  sp., of acidic soils [233 ]. Taking large-scale disturbance by mining activities and the urgent need for restoration efforts in to account, future research is recommended on developing sustainable technologies that produce high-quality inoculum within a reasonable time for large scale treatment. Table 6   depicts restoration of degraded lands with various microalgae species.   6 Leveraging microalgae research to attain the UN-sustainable development goals Innovative strategies are needed to replenish our finite land and water resources to ensure global sustainability, as we only have eight more years to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals planned for 2023. Additionally, ecological restoration of wastelands and wastewater is of the utmost importance for safeguarding a high standard of living and human well-being [246 ]. Soil and water being closely linked are critical for the entire life on earth, and therefore, their restoration can substantially contribute to the realization of various SDGs (especially, SDG-14 and SDG-15) and associated targets and initiatives (UN-Water; www.unwater.org , Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration; www.decadeonrestoration.org , UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, Sustainable Development Goals; www.sdgs.un.org , IUCN's Nature Based Solutions, UN Nations Convention on Biodiversity; CBD). Leveraging microalgae research from wastewater to wastelands (lab scale to landscape level) will be helpful to attain various SDGs in a timely manner. Besides, microalgae provide new biological resources for micro and small enterprises [43 ] (SDG-9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, SDG-11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, SDG-12: Responsible Consumption and Production), they can also provide clean water (SDG-6: Clean water and Sanitation) and bioenergy (SDG-7: Clean and affordable energy), health benefits (SDG-3: Good health and wellbeing), they also deliver services to manage land, water and life (SDG-14 and SDG-15: Life on Land and Below Water), climate (SDG-13: Climate action), and ultimate prosperity (SDG-8: Decent work and Economic Growth). In fact, all SDGs are strongly interconnected and therefore advancement in research and innovations targeted to contribute to one SDG will directly and/or indirectly support other SDGs as well (Fig. 3  ). The following seven subsections are developed where microalgae research through wastewater and wasteland restoration can directly contribute to SDGs. 6.1 No poverty: end poverty in all its forms everywhere (SDG-1); industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (SDG-9); Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG-11), and Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG-12) Land degradation, water scarcity, and poverty are prevailing together in many parts of the world [247 ,248 ]. Because of these ecological challenges, limited resources and associated threats, a large proportion of the farmer's population is marginalized [249 ,250 ]. These factors are significantly contributing to elevate poverty (please see Refs. [248 ,251 ]. In addition, as per the UN's report, 8% of workers with regular employment cannot live a decent life and face extreme poverty (UN 2020). To limit this, further water and land degradation must be halted, and new independent business ventures for young rural generations are needed. In this way, using microalgae to improve water and soil quality can present multiple direct and indirect income generation options. For instance, biopesticides and bio-stimulants are imperative for sustainable agriculture use of biofertilizers. Microalgae with such traits (please see section 2  for traits of different microalgae species) provide ample scope of rural and peri-urban business opportunities with continuous growth (making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, and resilient, Goal 11). In rural settings, ponds or wetlands are generally developed due to the collection of agricultural wastewaters (rich in methanogens and various inorganic and organic pollutants) discharged during rainy season, which can be utilized to cultivate identified microalgal species [28 ,134 ,252 ]. The collected water after growing microalgae and harvesting its biomass can be reused for agriculture and maybe discharged to freshwater ecosystems. This continuous process of harvesting rainwater and agricultural wastewater at one end can be a promising option for water conservation and concurrently this can help to combat pollution of freshwater bodies and save biodiversity therein. This innovative approach has been seen as a win-win-win scenario for social, economic and ecological benefits [253 ]. The harvested microalgae biomass can be utilized for various bioproducts (circular and sustainable economy; SGD 9) and entrepreneurial opportunities (SDG-1). Although integrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA) with microalgae is rare and generally involves macroalgal species, it is considered that microalgae-based IMTA is potentially effective for the bioremediation of nutrients [254 ]. Many microalgal species can also be used as biofilters, oxygenizers, and feed; they can be perfect candidates in IMTA systems [254 ,255 ]. IMTA with microalgae can be useful in filter feeders’ cultivation, with the treatment of nutrients in effluent to recirculate the water. These approaches can significantly contribute to socio-economic and environmental benefits via recycling of wastewater and biomass production (ensuring sustainable production of biological resources, SDG-12) for scaling up for commercial microalgal industrialization (promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, SDG-9). Various governments have invested money to develop economical and effective biorefinery technologies, install new industries, and set up incubation centers for bioenergy generation and high-value chemicals [256 ] (SDG-7). Biomass produced from microalgae can ensure a dedicated biomass supply for the bioenergy industry and economic benefits to manpower engaged at each level of the supply chain. A recent study showed a tremendous increase in microalgae based industry in 23 countries of the European Union, with Germany, Spain, and Italy on top [43 ]. The effectiveness of microalgae for various building materials, such as concrete strengthening agents, wood, dyes and paints, paper, packing material, fabrication, etc., has been assessed with varying possibilities [257 ]. For instance, the strength of cement mortar was enhanced 72 and 36%, respectively by microalgae species Synechococcus elongatus  and Spirulina platensis  through calcium carbonate precipitation in samples [258 ]. Likewise, in order to convert solar energy into bioelectricity Synechocystis  sp. of cyanobacteria has been used as a microbial agent for generating electrons through an anodic chamber [259 ]. Companies have been looking for cheaper and ecologically sustainable (reducing deforestation, land and water degradation) high quality biomaterials for various architectural and decorative products [260 ]. Microalgae, therefore, presents opportunities to support such emerging biobased industries.  6.2 Zero hunger: end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture (SDG-2) This section is strongly linked with SDG-1. There is no food security without recognizing the importance of soil and water. Further, global biodiversity thrives on these two earth components and offers various ecosystem services [249 ,261 ,262 ]. The biomass from microalgae grown in wastewater cannot be used for developing food products because of the accumulation of different pollutants and associated human health risks. However, bringing back degraded land and wastewater in use after its restoration with microalgae to cultivate food crops can supplement the supply of increased food demand (see research gaps). To meet the global annual demand for meat of 455 million tons by 2050 [261 ,263 ], we need to bring more land and water for livestock feed production. Microalgae can incentivize using arid and semi-arid land for feedstock production for livestock [264 ] and bioenergy [265 ]. This can also be a strategy to support land degradation neutrality targets by increasing soil carbon stock in productive degraded lands. In addition, microalgae as a factory for producing carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids without agronomic inputs, can provide high-quality proteins, fatty acids (generally polyunsaturated) and other nutraceuticals and supplements. The aquaculture industry, fastest growing food industry, can be a great consumer of microalgae biomass as fish feed [266 ]. Microalgae have great potential to be used as fish feed in a biorefinery context, likely as whole algae or lipid-extracted algae [102 ,266 ]. The other reason for microalgae being a promising food for fish is that it has the right blend of protein, lipids, and carbohydrates – appropriate to protect the fish's health. Compared to other organisms like yeast, bacteria, etc., microalgae are a rich source of protein and lipid [267 ,268 ]. Microalgae also have a well-balanced amino acid profile, obviating the need for high-cost amino acid supplements in the diet. The content starch is a readily digestible carbohydrate. Unlike plants, microalgae fiber lacks lignin and contains low hemicellulose which makes better digestibility.  6.3 Good health and wellbeing: ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages (SDG-3); clean water and sanitation: ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all (SDG-6) Water pollution is one of the severe threats impacting human health and wellbeing. The accumulation of nitrate (NO3 ) in water bodies due to various anthropogenic activities, such as domestic sewage, agricultural runoff, industrial effluents, livestock, etc., created a complex challenge for various nations [269 ,270 ]. The highest health risks associated with NO3  pollution in water are reported to infants and pregnant women [271 ,272 ]. Microalgae can be cultivated as an ecofriendly and sustainable option to effectively reduce pollutants from wastewater, particularly NO3  [273 ]. Recent studies showed different potentials and challenges associated with microalgae in removal of NO3  from urban wastewater [274 ]. Amini et al. [275 ] showed that D. salina , green algae, removed 54% NO3  from urban wastewater. However, another study that used five strains of Chlorella  sp. and Chlamydomonas  sp. showed 84.11% removing NO3  from urban wastewater [276 ]. The microalgal based bioremediation of emerging contaminants in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and pathogenic disinfection ensured better human health [277 ]. As a source of various micronutrients and vitamins, microalgae helped in a decrease in the prevalence of micronutrient deficiency diseases in children, women and geriatric people [278 ]. The discharged water from the mining sector often contains trace metals that can be toxic to aquatic animals and consumers. Whereas microalgae-assisted remediation of acid mine drainage substantially removes toxic pollutants and heavy metals and makes it safe for aquatic and human consumption. In vivo remediation of acid mine drainage employing Scenedesmus sp., the microalgal biomass was greater and more efficient at eliminating heavy metals [94 ]. Identifying new species with varying capacities to remediate the range of wastewaters in different geographical regions can substantially scale up microalgae research to ensure healthy lives, well-being, and water conservation. SDG-6 calls for safe drinking water  and sanitation for all and microalgae can play a significant role in realization of this goal [110 ]. Microalgae provide wastewater management opportunities through bioremediation (see section 4 ). The use of microalgae for wastewater treatment is an environmentally benign and sustainable wastewater treatment solution since it removes contaminants while producing biomass [81 ,279 ,280 ]. Industrial, home, and agricultural sewages  can also be treated with various species of microalgae [281 ,282 ]. Besides, High-Rate Algal Ponds (HRAP) are one type of microalgal-based treatment system recognized as a cost effective and efficient and an upgrade to conventional wastewater treatment ponds. These specialized ponds have been used in the treatment of a wide range of wastewaters, including municipal, agricultural and industrial [283 ]. Coupling microalgal-based wastewater treatment with bioremediation of wastewater has the potential to provide cost-effective remediation that will contribute to achieving SDG-6, particularly for communities where wastewater treatment would otherwise be cost prohibitive. Traditional techniques like filtration and centrifugation, among others, are employed to isolate algal cells, and demand substantial energy input, rendering them cost-prohibitive. Yet, recent advancements have led to the adoption of algal biorefinery strategies, integrating the production of algal biomass with wastewater treatment and industrial effluent remediation. These approaches have proven to be economically viable (SDG-8) and ecologically sustainable (SDG-6, 13 and 15). Abdo and colleagues showcased the economic feasibility of algal biofuels by remediating wastewater using a heterogeneous catalyst (Na4 SiO4) [284 ]. Similarly, large-scale production of algal biodiesel, coupled with the treatment of heavy metal-containing wastewater through green microalgae, could be economically advantageous [285 ]. Based on a daily biodiesel production of 1000 tons, this analysis projected around 444 million in returns over five years, equating to a promising 16.4% return on investment (ROI). Furthermore, the study forecasted a potential economic yield of up to US$20 million with an initial capital investment of US$124 million. Skarlis and Kaldellis evaluated the economic viability of smaller-scale biodiesel production pilots (10,000 tons/year capacity) with an investment of up to 4,000,000 euros. Their results indicated assured profitability even at 2/3 of the plant's operational capacity [286 ]. However, the judicious selection of algal strains, viable separation techniques like autoinoculation and electroflocculation, as well as downstream processes remains crucial and should be informed by recent research findings.  6.4 Affordable and clean energy: ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all (SDG-7) Access to affordable, clean, and renewable energy is needed at every walk of life, whether for domestic use, transport, agriculture, or even industrial application. The large-scale adoption of microalgal based restoration of degraded systems ensures realization of various linked SDGs. Microalgae have been proven to be an effective species with unlimited potential for biomass production and renewable and inexhaustible biofuel/bioenergy generation (Fig. 4  ) [287 ]. The production of various biofuels, such as biodiesel, butanol, bioethanol, biogas, biooil, jet fuel, etc., from microalgal biomass is possible [288 ]. A recent study estimates that 47500–142000 L oil ha−1  year−1  can be produced from microalgae [289 ]. Several researchers have tested various strategies to enhance the wastewater treatment efficacy of microalgae while concurrently producing biomass and bioenergy [29 ,49 ,86 ,290–292 ]. Several studies critically synthesize the knowledge and discuss all possibilities of cultivating microalgae as a single group or combined with various bacteria and fungi, for wastewater treatment and bioenergy generation [77 ,292 ]. Because of its fast growth and comparatively short life cycle, microalgae can be harvested multiple times a year without additional inputs. On the other hand, growing lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks requires investments such as land, water, protection, manpower and a comparatively longer time to harvest biomass [293 ]. Recently, the commercial level production of microalgae based biodiesel technology from urban wastewater has been developed by Durban University of Technology, South Africa, in collaboration with Japan International Cooperation Agency [294 ]. This is projected as the first commercial level project in Africa where 300000-Liter wastewater is treated with microalgae and biomass is harvested for biodiesel production and other value-added products. In conclusion, microalgae can contribute to ensuring access to reasonably priced, dependable, sustainable, and modern energy in addition to helping to clean wastewater.  6.5 Decent work and economic growth: promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment, and decent work for all (SDG-8) The realization of all societal (SDG-1-5, 7, 11 and 16) and economic goals (SDG-8, 9, 10, and 12) is possible through scaling up environmental sustainability (SDG-8, 13, 15 and 14) in a participatory approach (SDG-17). Certainly, decent work and economic growth can be supported through water pollution remediation and land restoration in several ways (Fatima et al., 2020). The use of microalgae has strong implications for not only water and land restoration but also adds to opportunities for sustainable development and employment. A highly skilled and semi-skilled workforce is required to implement various techniques such as the construction of basic infrastructure, operating various equipment and tools, and monitoring of water quality and soil health during the wasteland and wastewater remediation process. Given that environmental issues associated with water and land pollution are increasing, global negotiations for their remediation are mounting and national restoration policies are being formulated, there is increasing demand for technologies and service for wasteland and wastewater remediation [117 ,295 ]. This leads to the inception of new industries and markets centered around technologies, green infrastructure and sustainable practices fostering microalgae-based research, innovation and economic growth. The enhance agricultural output from restored land and quality water, better places for tourism and recreational activities, better health and productivity, and contribution to circular bioeconomy are promising areas in which microalgae-based remediation of wastelands and wastewater can significantly contribute to improve decent work and economic growth.  6.6 Climate action: take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts (SDG-13) A significant amount of carbon captured through the photosynthesis activity of microalgae and a substantial decrease in CO2  emissions by replacing fossil fuel with microalgae-based bioenergy (linked with SDG 7) are two critical mechanisms to combat climate change and its impacts. Despite some challenges associated with techno-economic feasibility, microalgae as a micro-cell factory with high photosynthetic efficiency sequesters CO2  very effectively and sustainably [296 ]. Although, the rate of CO2  fixation by microalgae may vary with different species, their mutants and altered conditions [297 ], it is estimated that 1.83 tons of atmospheric CO2  were consumed to produce a ton of microalgae biomass [298 ,299 ]. In addition, converting inorganic carbons into proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids (SDG 3). Cultivation of bioenergy crops on forestlands, grasslands and even in degraded lands causes carbon emissions at different levels due to land tillage and land-use conversion [300 ]. After COP 21, a substantial increase in demand for a dedicated high-quality biomass supply has been seen, and a many fold increase is expected after the climate pact announcement in COP26 to end the use of coal. Extracting biomass and bioenergy from aquatic ecosystems (no competition with food crops; SDG 2) does not contribute to greenhouse emissions, reduces pressure on terrestrial biomass and supports biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration and climate mitigation. In addition, the use of microalgae biomass as mulch in salt-affected soils (reduces water evaporation), water holding source in arid lands (support regeneration of native flora), and source of organic matter in carbon poor lands maximizes the soil carbon sequestration [29 ]. Production of biodiesel by blending petroleum fuel with bio-oil from microalgae biomass can reduce CO2  emissions from the automobile industry [301 ,302 ]. However, a recent study showed an increase in CO2  emissions and a decrease in NOx (4.9%), particulate matter (20.7%), and smoke (5.4%) with increasing blending percentage with Spirulina microalgae biodiesel combustion in compression ignition engines [301 ]. Nevertheless, there are multiple microalgae-based avenues to support climate actions.  6.7 Life below water: conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development (SDG-14); clean water and sanitation: ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all (SDG-6) Life below water is in more danger than life on land. The discharge of differently polluted water to small ponds, lakes, rivers, seas, and oceans is threatening the life below water. Eutrophication of coastal zones and ocean acidification impacts the billion-dollar coral reef economy [51 ]. Tremendous scope and opportunities lie in the remediation of wastewater with microalgae to save the mined and unmined biodiversity below water and blue economy [303 ] (UN-Water, UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development 2021; https://www.oceandecade.org ). Although there are a few scientific studies investigated that wastewater treated with microalgae has a lesser impact on flora and fauna in receiving water bodies than the discharge of post-chlorinated wastewater [304 ,305 ]. Repurposing wastewater that has been microalgae-treated for home and agricultural purposes promotes ethical production and consumption of biological resources (SDG-12) and ensures water availability and sustainable water management (SDG-6).  6.8 Life on land: protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss (SDG-15) Currently, 75% of the land area of the earth is degraded (EU-JRC 2019) with 1.3 billion farmers, equal to the population of India, growing plants (26%) and livestock (14%) on 40% of the land area [306 ,307 ], to provide food to 7 billion people [308 ]. By 2050 we will need 70% of land to provide food to >9 billion people. Thus, our land and life on it are in severe crisis. All socio-economic needs of humans can be met by establishing a strong nexus between soil, water, and biodiversity. Microalgae, as an effective and affordable resource for land restoration, and water remediation in fresh and marine ecosystems can ensure reversing biodiversity loss on the land and in the water. A large group of microalgae is being used as biofertilizers, biocontrol and biopesticides in agricultural settings [26 ,30 ]. This can substantially contribute to sustainable agriculture during the post-global biodiversity framework at COP15 of the Convention on Biological Diversity. In addition, bringing degraded land under cultivation with the potential use of microalgae can be an effective alternative to decreasing availability of organic and biological amendments (SDG-2). Further, restored land can be cultivated to supply biological resources for growing a biobased economy (SDG-7). Plethora of studies reported the exceptional potential of microalgae to restore degraded lands and support biodiversity (see section 5 ).   7 Research gaps and critical challenges Microalgae are an essential component of biodiversity and have been effective and beneficial for the remediation of wastewater from different sources. The utilization of a few microalgae species studied intensively and identified from various taxonomic classes can be commercialized for wastewater treatment, biomass production, and wasteland restoration. However, prominent research on microalgae for land restoration has been based on cyanobacteria in controlled laboratory conditions or pot experiments. As research shows, microalgae are beneficial for restoring wastewater and wastelands. Further research and innovations in this direction can substantially contribute to attaining various SDGs in a timely manner. However, there is an urgent need to address, but not be limited to, the following research gaps and key challenges. Research gaps : The current research on wastewater treatment has been confined to using one or two microalgae species without understanding their impact on other microscopic flora and fauna. There is a need to harness diverse and multifunctional microalgae communities for more effective wastewater remediation and higher biomass production. 2. Identification of potential microalgae species and a suite of species with synergistic effectiveness in wastewater remediation and biomass production is needed. 3. Microalgae can grow in a range of environments and on substrates, but for financially feasible, large-scale production, storage and transportation, further research and technological innovations are needed. Small to large ponds, wetlands (natural and constructed), etc., should further be tested for microalgae cultivation and harvest. 4. Long-term field studies on using microalgae as a nature-based tool for the restoration of differently degraded lands are not available. This demands further investigations where prokaryotic cyanobacteria and other eukaryotic microalgae should be tested to restore degraded lands. 5. Besides use of microalgae biomass in land restoration, it should be tested for developing horticulture and floriculture plant nurseries. 6. Identifying cost-effective approaches for application of microalgae biomass in the field. The application may be tested with various agricultural, forestry and cattle wastes. Other domestic, municipal, and industrial wastes should also be explored. 7. There are fewer studies – greenhouse and field – on how microalgae – live cells and biomass – affect physical, chemical, and biological properties of degraded and/or marginal lands. 8. Detailed research to understand technical and economical perspectives of microalgae use is needed from different geographical regions. 9. Given the current decade has been set as a timeline to achieve various climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation goals, further research on carbon capture, other greenhouse gas benefits and biodiversity support potential of microalgae should be done. 10. Reuse potential of wastewater treated with microalgae for dryland agriculture can be promising research lines for future studies. 11. Information on the impact of chlorinated and biologically treated wastewaters on soil and water biodiversity is not much available in the literature. Key challenges : Although the use of microalgae for wastewater remediation has received great attention because effective and speedy removal of organic compounds, nutrients, and other toxic contaminants, there has been a few key economical, biological, challenges, environmental and operational challenges that limits wastewater treatment a larger scale [76 ,274 ]. 1. Microalgal biomass production can be more expensive than crop cultivation due to various reasons such as special maintenance requirements of specific microalgal species. Many microalgal species are sensitive to various environmental factors including seasonal variations in sunlight, and temperature. Almost 100 tons of microalgal biomass can fix approximately 183 t of carbon dioxide, but it is necessary to provide it continuously during daylight hours [309 ]. The operational functionality (primary mechanical treatment setup) and treatment process (prior chemical treatments and then biological treatments) require skilled operators and are not cost-effective and scalable [76 ,274 ]. The inefficiency of microalgal biomass through biodiesel production and other value-added products to compensate for the economic and environmental cost paid in terms of energy used in wastewater treatment is another important challenge. 2. Many companies started focusing on microalgal production in the 2000s by implementing the open-pond outdoor cultivation system which can show a few advantages such as less operational costs and low energy input requirements. But it can easily be affected by climatic conditions, and there are possibilities of contamination. With this, there is a need to select an appropriate site for microalgae cultivation and to assess environmental conditions prior to establishing an open pond [310 ]. 3. In addition, to get microalgal feedstock the requirement of considerable land for large-scale cultivation is another challenge. Although there is an alternative for offshore cultivation using transparent polymer films such as polyethylene or polyurethane [311 ], it is useful for countries with seashores. But such cultivation's technological, economic, and environmental feasibility is questionable. 4. Genetically engineered (GM) microalgal stains can be economically feasible but can create many environmental issues. However, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA) approved GM freshwater microalga Acutodesmus dimorphus  to cultivate in the outdoor open-pond bioreactors as it did not outcompete the native algal population [311 ].  8 Conclusions This review clearly highlights that microalgae are important organisms that can significantly contribute to wastewater remediation. The cultivation of microalgae in wastewater and generating various forms of bioenergies further strengthens and justifies their economic and ecological importance. Microalgae species, their communities and biomass can also substantially contribute to restoration of degraded and/or polluted lands, increasing crop production and socio-ecological benefits. However, it will be crucial to understand the broader implications for mass-scale usage of diverse and multifunctional microalgae communities for effective wastewater remediation and higher biomass production that can further also be used in carbon capture and bioenergy generation. One cannot ignore the production costs for microalgal biomass production that requires special maintenance as many of these species are sensitive to various environmental factors. Inadequate technological advancements, the great expectation for yield increases, and the modern monetization of its environmental benefits are among the constraints on their commercial production. Hence more efforts are needed to reduce costs of these setups to scale up onsite applications of microalgal technologies. There will be a need for more diverse and long-term field-based studies on using microalgae for restoring degraded lands and its long-term impacts on regaining ecosystem services and biodiversity. This review clearly highlights that the ecological restoration of wastewater and wastelands is of paramount importance for ensuring a good quality of life and human wellbeing. Soil and water being closely linked are critical for entire life on earth; therefore, their restoration can substantially contribute to realizing various SDGs. Review also provided evidence to reduce and address poverty reduction efforts by using microalgae to improve water and soil quality in multiple direct and indirect income generation options as well as reducing, further degradation of water and land while providing new independent business ventures for young rural generations.
