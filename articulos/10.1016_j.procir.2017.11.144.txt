Introduction Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) emerged as  a methodology allowing a detailed representation of  technologies in their processes from a life cycle perspective.  In addition, it enables sustainability assessments in its  different perspectives (environmental, economic and social).  To conduct a profound LCSA, a plausible indicator selection  is needed. One possible approach to define an LCSA indicator  set is to follow political decision processes. Currently, the  most important political decision process on a global scale is  the definition of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by  the UN [1], see Table 1. An indicator set chosen for  technology sustainability assessment is gaining increasing  relevance and reliability if related directly to SDGs. Table 1 Sustainable development goals [1]. No. Goal 1 End poverty in all its forms everywhere  2 End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and  promote sustainable agriculture 3 Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages 4 Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong  learning opportunities for all 5 Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls 6 Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and  sanitation for all 7 Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy  for all 8 Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full  and productive employment and decent work for all 9 Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable  industrialization and foster innovation  2018 The Authors.

Maier et al. [2] assign the  SDGs to certain impact category groups, e.g. health or  climate, and, in a second stage, assign impact categories to the  category groups, e.g. respiratory diseases as part of the group  health. Each impact category can be comprised of different  indicators, which can be case specific or more generic LCA  impact categories. The authors apply this approach to the  example of the impact category group health in the context of  development cooperation projects. However, no full example  for an application of all impact categories is given and the  direct connection between the chosen indicators and the SDGs  is weakened by several steps of impact categorization. Another publication [3] assigns the SDG indicators to  stakeholders based on LCA and the Product Social Metrics  Handbook. This assignment, however, can only be the first  step to a connection between SDGs and LCSA. Though the SDGs are designed for countries or regions also  a product based sustainability assessment method like LCSA  can provide guidance. In this paper the LCSA indicators are  assigned to the SDGs in a first step and their indicators  published by the UN [4] in a second step for a product on the  micro level. The applicability of this selection will be tested  by an LCSA case study about electrolytic hydrogen  production. This work is supposed to be a first approximation  between LCSA and SDGs and demonstrates which problems might occur along the way.   2. Methodology As already mentioned, the SDGs are predominantly targeted towards countries and regions. For the assessment of  products they more or less do not fit. To close this gap, it is  necessary to identify the motivation behind the SDGs. As the UN not only passed goals but also defined indicators and  targets to lay them out further, these specifications can be  used as guidelines for indicator selection in LCSA also. The SDGs are tiered into the actual goals, e.g. 3 â€˜Ensure  healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all agesâ€™, see Table 1, targets, e.g. 3.9 â€˜By 2030, substantially reduce the  number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contaminationâ€™, and SDG  indicators, which describe how the targets can be measured,  e.g. 3.9.1 â€˜Mortality rate attributed to household and ambient  air pollutionâ€™ [4]. In total 169 targets and 232 SDG indicators  have been developed by the UN. The LCSA indicator set comprises indicators from LCA,  social LCA (s-LCA), and Life Cycle Costing (LCC). LCA is  an established method to evaluate environmental impacts of  technologies or products. Its methodology has been enhanced for decades. Therefore, several indicators have consensus  within the community, only their methodology is  continuously updated. Also for still controversial indicators,  e.g. water, a consensus is sought after [5]. In contrast, social  LCA (s-LCA) is a relatively new field of research with little  consensus on methodology and indicators. The here applied  PSILCA database is only one of several approaches, which try  to operationalise social assessment. LCC is an established  approach in economics [6, 7]. However, historically the  approach is not linked to sustainability assessments, the  chosen indicators are varying, and the methodological  harmonization with LCA in the form of environmental life  cycle costing is quite new [8]. In a first step of our approach the SDG goals are matched with LCSA indicators. The goals, however, are often very  general. Some LCSA indicators can therefore be matched  very easily, while others, which are equally important, find no  connection. In a second step a look is taken at the SDG  indicators, which are much more specific. As they are initially  customized for regions and countries there is sometimes more  argumentation needed to match them with product related  LCSA indicators. Thus, a line of reasoning needs to be given  for most of the indicator pairs. The target tier of the SDGs is  not further discussed since it mainly pertains to the time  horizon of goal fulfilment. A depiction of this approach is  presented in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Schematic diagram to link SDGs with LCSA. The LCA indicator selection is starting from the ILCD  recommendations [9] and the more recent guidance from the  UNEP/SETAC [10] on a midpoint level. Only those LCA  indicators implemented in the LCA software GaBi 7 are taken  into consideration. The s-LCA indicators must be  implemented in the PSILCA database 1.0 [11]. These indicators are based on the s-LCA guidelines [12] and the  accompanying methodological sheets [13]. The PSILCA  database uses the multi-regional input/output database Eora  and provides data for 189 countries [11]. Consequently, the  data in PSILCA is provided per sector as specified in Eora.  However, social and socio-economic data is not always  available per sector but rather on the country level, which is  also, for example, the case for the illiteracy indicator. In such  a case the developers of PSILCA used several steps to  attribute data to each sector, starting by mapping the sectors to  the raw data from statistical agencies as well as private and  governmental databases. Afterwards data for sectors, for  SDGs (Table 1) SDG indicators Preselected LCSA indicators Goal based indicator set (Table 2) SDG indicator based indicator set (Table 3) Application with case study (Table 4) Evaluation 61 Christina Wulf et al. /  Procedia CIRP  69 ( 2018 )  59 â€“ 65  which raw data was not available, was extrapolated. This data  was risk-assessed by PSILCA in line with international  conventions and standards. For example, the risk assessment  of illiteracy in the German electricity sector is stated as â€˜very  low riskâ€™. Given that many of the indicators used in s-LCA  refer to the general societal situation in a country, exact  scaling to the functional unit proves difficult.   The inventory needed as input for the PSILCA  calculations are technical specification about the product  system, which are translated into monetary terms using  publicly available prices (e.g. Alibaba.com). PSILCA then  connects these monetary amounts of each sector input with  the risk-assessed social data established through the  methodology described above. Advantages and disadvantages  of this relatively new approach are not topic of this paper. The LCC indicators refer to a guide prepared by the  European Investment Bank [14] and literature on economic  assessment of energy technologies, e.g. [15-17]. In this  indicator selection double or even triple counting of indicators  is prevented. Therefor only 54 indicators are looked at in  PSILCA. The other PSILCA indicators are already provided  for by LCA indicators. 3. Results 3.1. Indicator selection When assigning the LCSA indicators to the SDGs on goal  tier, 14 out of 17 goals can be described by LCSA indicators,  see Table 2. Table 2 LCSA indicators assigned to SDGs on goal tier (normal: LCA  indicators, bold: s-LCA indicators, italic: LCC indicators). No. LCSA Indicator 1 Living wage, Minimum wage, Sector average wage,  Unemployment rate in a country 2 - 3 Human toxicity cancer, Human toxicity non-cancer, Ionizing  radiation, ozone depletion, Particulate matter, Photochemical ozone  creation, Accident rate at workplace, Fatal accidents at  workplace, Presence of sufficient safety measures, Drinking  water coverage, Sanitation coverage, Health expenditure public,  Health expenditure out of pocket, Health expenditure external  resources, Health expenditure out of the total GDP of the  country, Social security expenditure 4 Illiteracy rate total, Youth illiteracy rate total 5 Women in the labour force, Gender wage gap 6 Resource depletion â€“ Water, Drinking water coverage, Sanitation  coverage 7 Levelized cost of energy 8 Goods produced by forced labour, Frequency of forced labour,  Tier placement referring to trafficking in persons,  Children in  employment total, Living wage, Minimum wage, Sector average  wage, Trade union density as a % of paid employment total,  Right of Association, Right of Collective Bargaining, Right to  Strike, Social security expenditure, Evidence of violations of laws  and employment regulations, Hours of work per employee, per  day, Hours of work per employee, per week, Standard weekly  hours, Standard daily hours, Net present value, Profitability index,  Internal rate of return, Payback time, Dynamic payback time 9 Marginal  cost 10 Human rights issues faced by indigenous people 11 - 12 Resource depletion â€“ Abiotic resources 13 Climate change 14 Freshwater ecotoxicity, Freshwater eutrophication, Marine  eutrophication 15 Acidification, Terrestrial eutrophication 16 Freedom of association rights, Trade union density as a % of paid  employment total, Right of Association, Right of Collective  Bargaining, Right to Strike, Evidence of violations of laws and  employment regulations 17 - For the social indicators 32 out of 54 provided by PSILCA are matching to characterise the SDGs. An example for an  important social issue not compatible with the SDG goal tier  is corruption, which is excluded from this level of analysis.  For the environmental indicators 14 out of 16 from the  recommendations can be assigned to the SDGs. Only impacts  regarding land use and energy demand find no place within  the SDGs. The LCC indicators comprise the levelized cost of  energy, the net present value of the investment, operation and  deconstruction phases, the profitability index of an  investment, and the marginal cost of energy supply.  Generally, further economic indicators are relevant for  assessing a technology such as the internal rate of return,  payback time or dynamic payback time. Depending on the  system boundary they are applicable only in case the use  phase of the product (or the demand side paying a price for  the intended product) is part of the analysis. The assignment of LCSA indicators to the SDG indicators  is listed in Table 3. Then, only twelve out of 17 goals from the  SDGs can be covered on an SDG indicator tier. Apart from goal 17, which is covered neither on a goal nor on an indicator  tier, the two approaches lead to different goals not being considered. For the goal tier these are goals 2 and 11. On a  SDG indicator tier the goals 5, 9, 13, and 15 are not covered. Here, it is most surprising that goal 13 (â€˜climate changeâ€™)  cannot be represented by the LCA impact category climate  change. The SDG indicators are targeted towards climate  change adaptation and not mitigation. Table 3 LCSA indicators assigned to SDGs on indicator tier.

public official, or were  asked for a bribe by those public officials during the previous 12  months Active involvement of  enterprises in corruption and  bribery For the LCA indicators all 16 are assigned to the SDG  indicators. For the social assessment, in contrast, only 22 out  of 54 PSILCA indicators can be matched. For example, the  connection between the PSILCA indicator illiteracy and the  SDGs is established by SDG indicator 4.6.1. This indicator  corresponds to the statistics provided by UNESCO, which  also serves as the basis for the PSILCA calculations of  illiteracy. Without having full knowledge of the methods used  in developing the PSILCA database we assume that the  positive UNESCO literacy statistics were simply reversed to  provide data for illiteracy. The decrease in indicators  employed compared to the goal tier can be explained by the  increased level of detail of the SDG indicator tier. For  example, important social issues liked forced labour are not  included on this level. Although the chosen LCC indicators match the general  focus of goals 7, 8, and 9, they do not really fit to the  respective SDG indicators. The main reason is that SDG  indicators do not focus on process-relevant assessments of the  investment, operation, and demolition phases of plants,  installation sites, respectively on economic efficiency and the  rationales for investment in and operation of plants. They  rather focus on assessing other scales of economic systems  such as sectoral, macro-economic, development economics, institutional and socio-economic ones. 3.2. Case study To test the application of the new found LCSA indicator  sets in a case study already existing LCA and LCC are adapted. It comprises a comparison of three locations for  hydrogen production with an advanced alkaline water  electrolyzer. The countries Germany, Spain and Austria offer  different opportunities for industrial hydrogen production.  The LCA modelling is based on [26], while the LCC is taken  from [17]. The s-LCA is conducted with the PSILCA  database [11] integrated in openLCA 1.6. The functional unit  for the LCSA is 1 kg of hydrogen produced. The two indicator sets identified above are applied for this  case study. For the LCSA goal-based indicator set 50 indicators are calculated while for the LCSA SDG indicator- based indicator set only 38 indicators are calculated. The  results are listed in Table 4. Beginning with the SDG indicator tier, for the social  analysis the hydrogen production is measured against 22 social indicators. The PSILCA database combines indicators  into impact categories and uses medium risk hours as unit of  measurement. When calculating risk points, PSILCA  produces a default output of 35 impact categories, which  represent either single indicators or combined indicator sets in  impact categories. The SDG indicator-based assessment  provides risk levels for 17 impact categories. The indicator-based analysis shows that out of the three  locations under investigation hydrogen production in Austria (14.2 med risk hours) exhibits the highest level of social risks,  followed by Spain (13.4 med risk hours) and Germany (10.1 med risk hours). Overall, the risks associated with each  process stem mainly from the water (Ã¸ 60 %) and electricity  (Ã¸ 40 %) sector and their upstream chains; other sectors only  exert marginal impact. The overall highest level of social risks  is found for â€˜Fair salaryâ€™ (Germany: 1.4 med risk hours,  Austria: 1.9 med risk hours) and â€˜Unemploymentâ€™ (Spain: 2.0  med risk hours). The goal-based assessment provides risk levels for 21  impact categories based on 32 social indicators. The analysis shows no difference in the ranking of locations in terms of  social risk; however, the differences between the overall risk  levels per location become slightly more pronounced (Austria:  15.5 med risk hours, Spain: 14.1 med risk hours, Germany:  10.1 med risk hours). In the goal-based assessment four of the  impact categories considered in the indicator-based  assessment are no longer included, instead, seven different  impact categories are added. For example, the goal-based assessment includes the impact categories â€˜Frequency of  forced labourâ€™ and â€˜Goods produced by forced labourâ€™. While  forced labour is of high importance in relation to Sustainable  Development, the s-LCA indicators associated with these  impact categories cannot be matched with SDG indicators. For the LCA applying the goal-based indicator set  comprises the 14 identified indicators. It can be clearly stated  that Austria shows the best results as it is the best country in  ten out of 14 indicators. When comparing the other two  countries (Spain and Germany) ranking is harder to tell as  Spain shows worst results for seven and best for three  indicators while Germany shows worst results for five and  best for one indicator. When applying the SDG indicator-based indicator set 16 indicators should be calculated. â€˜Land useâ€™, however, is  implemented in GaBi but not with the characterisation model  the UNEP/SETAC recommends [10]. Due to the ongoing  scientific discussion in the LCA community this indicator is  excluded from the indicator set leaving 15 indicators to be  calculated. The one additional indicator does not change the  overall picture already painted by the slightly smaller goal- 64   Christina Wulf et al. /  Procedia CIRP  69 ( 2018 )  59 â€“ 65  based indicator set. Still Austria is by far the best option (best  in twelve out of 15 indicators) and Spain as well as Germany  still close together (seven worst indicator results each). The  following statements are valid for both indicator sets: The decisive factor is the electricity supply in all three  countries. Its share amounts to 80 % in case of Austria and  even 90 % in case of Spain and Germany for most indicators. Against this background it is not surprising that Austria has  the lowest environmental impacts due to their high share of  hydro power (58 % [27]) on the total electricity mix. For the chosen case the economic indicators are restricted.  As the use phase of the product and respective returns from  market activities are excluded, the internal rate of return and  payback times cannot be calculated. For all four remaining  economic indicators the German site performs best. From a  cost perspective, the price of electricity for the hydrogen  technology has a decisive impact. Therefore, it should be kept  in mind that the projection of electricity prices is subject to a  range of assumptions, including the political influence on cost  components such as grid transport, taxes, and contributions to  finance renewable energy sources. If, contrary to the  assumption here, electricity prices are going to adjust over  time, and if the energy-intensive industries will lose its  beneficial regulatory status with respect to the German  Renewable Energy Act (EEG), the relative advantage of the  German site may disappear. At the moment Germany has the  lowest prices for electricity due to the regulatory status of  energy-intensive industries within the financial support of  renewable energy sources.

Conclusions While the SDGs focus on changing conditions on a  country-level, LCSA analysis is geared towards a particular  process or technology mostly on micro level. This uneven  focus can lead to imprecise predictions of whether or not a  particular process can contribute to reach the SDGs.  The difference in issues included in the goal- and indica- tor-based assessment leads to slightly different definitions of  Sustainable Development. This impressively portrays the  importance of a diligent indicator selection. For the LCA the two identified indicator sets show only  slight differences (one indicator) while for the s-LCA  significant differences are observed. For the LCC even no  indicator set on SDG indicator tier can be compiled. This  emphasises the difference between the sustainability  assessment on a country or region level and on a process  chain level. 65 Christina Wulf et al. /  Procedia CIRP  69 ( 2018 )  59 â€“ 65  In consequence, to assign the LCSA indicators to the SDGs  requires a longer line of argumentation based on the fact that  the SDGs are conceptualized for country or regional level  while LCSA aims at products at micro level. Only for few  indicators, e.g. unemployment, nearly perfect congruence is  provided. In contrast, the LCA indicator particulate matter is  assigned to the goal 3 and the SDG indicators 3.4.1 and 3.9.1  because of the effects of particulate matter to human health on  the endpoint level (mixing endpoint and midpoint level is  another limitation of this approach). In addition this impact  category is also assigned to the SDG indicator 11.6.2. This  SDG indicator has clear connections to the LCA impact  category particulate matter but is less comprehensive. Sometimes the idea behind the SDGs and SDG indicators is  plainly translated into LCSA indicators because a translation  with perfect overlap is not possible.  The LCSA case study on different hydrogen production  sites shows that only the goal based indicator set can be  applied for a full sustainability assessment comprising all  dimensions of sustainability. For this case study no qualitative  differences in the results of the LCA and s-LCA of the  indicator sets can be found. Further case studies have to proof  if this is a universally valid statement. In sum, the SDG goal-based indicator set proves  appropriate to be applied in an LCSA study. The SDG  indicator-based indicator set reveals more matching problems  between SDGs and LCSA. In particular the economic  assessment related to the SDGs is difficult because of the  discrepancies between the macro-economic intentions of the  SDGs and the microeconomic nature of LCC. Nevertheless,  taking a look at the SDG indicators for a particular case  provides an enhanced understanding of the SDGs and guide  indicator selection. References [1] UN General Assembly.

Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) emerged as a methodology allowing a detailed representation of technologies in their processes from a life cycle perspective. To conduct a profound LCSA a plausible indicator selection is needed. From a Sustainability perspective, the currently dominant political framework is the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. In this paper, LCSA indicators are selected based on the SDGs, comparing in a first approach the implication due to the selection based on overall goals and SDG indicators level. The applicability of this selection is tested by a case study of electrolytic hydrogen production. The analysis shows meaningful differences between the goal-based and the indicator-based assessment. Only the goal-based indicator set comprises all dimensions of sustainability.
