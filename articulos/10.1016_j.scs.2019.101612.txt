                  Across the world, governments have developed strategies to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). Sustainable buildings perform a significant function toward achieving the UN SDGs. Currently, there is a lack of information on this subject because no existing sustainable building assessment system describes the relationship between its assessment criteria and the UN SDGs. In this article, a new framework is proposed to integrate the UN SDGs into the assessment and management of sustainable non-residential buildings in Jordan. For this purpose, previous building rating systems were reviewed, and the Delphi technique was applied to identify assessment categories and indicators for sustainable non-residential buildings in Jordan. Moreover, the analytic hierarchy process and relative importance index methods were employed to develop an integrated weighting system for assessment indicators based on the significance of sustainability problems in Jordan and contributions to achieve the UN SDGs. Additionally, questionnaire surveys were conducted to construct a classification system and thereafter identify the integration of assessment indicators into project phases. Finally, the proposed framework was validated by conducting a focus group discussion. The findings in this research can potentially assist in the formulation of building assessment tools and achievement of the UN SDGs in countries, such as Jordan.

Across the world, governments have developed strategies to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). Sustainable buildings perform a significant function toward achieving the UN SDGs. Currently, there is a lack of information on this subject because no existing sustainable building assessment system describes the relationship between its assessment criteria and the UN SDGs. In this article, a new framework is proposed to integrate the UN SDGs into the assessment and management of sustainable non-residential buildings in Jordan. For this purpose, previous building rating systems were reviewed, and the Delphi technique was applied to identify assessment categories and indicators for sustainable non-residential buildings in Jordan. Moreover, the analytic hierarchy process and relative importance index methods were employed to develop an integrated weighting system for assessment indicators based on the significance of sustainability problems in Jordan and contributions to achieve the UN SDGs. Additionally, questionnaire surveys were conducted to construct a classification system and thereafter identify the integration of assessment indicators into project phases. Finally, the proposed framework was validated by conducting a focus group discussion. The findings in this research can potentially assist in the formulation of building assessment tools and achievement of the UN SDGs in countries, such as Jordan.   Keywords Sustainable building  Jordan  United Nations  Sustainable Development Goals  Integrated weight  Analytic hierarchy process (AHP)  Relative importance index (RII)    1 Introduction With the aim of eliminating discrimination, inequality, and poverty as well as overcome climate change by 2030, the 193 member states of the United Nations (UN) formulated the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on September 25, 2015 (United Nations, 2018a, 2018b ). The 17 UN SDGs encompassed numerous economic and social–developmental problems, such as health, poverty, hunger, education, gender equality, climate change, water, sanitation, environment, energy, and social justice (United Nations, 2018a, 2018b ). As one of the critical areas that necessitates intervention, the building and construction sector provides opportunities to limit environmental impact and contribute to the achievement of the UN SDGs (UNEP, 2018b ). In each country, the construction industry is the main contributor to socioeconomic development and the major consumer of energy and natural resources. Therefore, it is essential to take into consideration the involvement of this sector in achieving sustainable development in our society (UNEP-IETC, 2003 ). It has been reported that this sector provides 5–10% of employment at the national level and generates 5–15% of the gross domestic product (GDP) (UNEP, 2018b ). Moreover, the relationship between buildings and public health has been verified by numerous studies (Park & Yoon, 2011; Satish et al., 2012 ). Concurrently, the construction and building sector accounts for 40% of annual energy consumption, up to 30% of all energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, and 12% of all freshwater usage; moreover, it produces up to 40% of annual solid waste (UNEP, 2018b ). The built environment has a critical impact on several local and global problems, such as demographic shifts, climate change, water, land use, and other resource scarcity (UNEP, 2018a ); consequently, three sustainability key areas, namely, society, environment, and economy are considerably affected (UNEP, 2018a ). The importance of conducting building environmental assessments in the construction industry is highlighted by the increasing environmental consideration of their impacts (Tatari & Kucukvar, 2011 ). The construction industry critically affects the three elements of social development: social progress, economic growth, and successful environmental protection (Sev, 2009 ). In this regard, a sustainable construction necessitates activities that are safe economically, socially, and environmentally (Illankoon, Tam, & Le, 2016 ). The Environmental Protection Agency defines “green building” as “the practice of creating structures and using processes that are environmentally responsible and resource efficient throughout a building's life cycle from siting to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and deconstruction. Green building is also known as a sustainable or high-performance building” (EPA, 2018 ). To avert energy crisis and climate change, governments worldwide have adopted green building as a key policy (Shen, Yan, Fan, Wu, & Zhang, 2017 ). The World Green Building Council stated that “green buildings can contribute to meeting the sustainable development goals” (World Green Building Council, 2018 ). Several green rating systems have been developed to assess the degree of being green or sustainable of a building (Wu & Low, 2010 ); to achieve sustainable development, green building assessment tools can be implemented and applied (Ali & Al Nsairat, 2009 ). However, a majority of building environmental assessment schemes only focused on the environmental aspect, whereas the economic, social, and cultural aspects were partially neglected. Illankoon et al. (2016)  analyzed the effectiveness of eight international green building rating tools in terms of evaluating the environmental, economic, and social sustainability of buildings. The results showed that these tools have widely considered environmental sustainability; however, their economic sustainability was rarely evaluated. Furthermore, all green building rating tools have evaluated social sustainability, which accounts for approximately 20% of the credit points allocated by each rating tool (Illankoon et al., 2016 ). In 2016, the UN has classified Jordan as a lower-middle-income nation with a per capita GDP of US$4,087.9. Its population has increased from 5,597,000 in 2004 to 9,798,000 in 2016; over 80% of residents are in urban areas. The construction sector of Jordan has contributed 4.4% to the GDP; this is equivalent to an additional 1195.8 million JOD in 2016. Furthermore, this sector provided employment to approximately 6.1% of the total Jordanian labor force. The total number of buildings permits in Jordan was 7576 in 2016 as shown in Fig. 1   (Department of Statistics, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017a, 2017b ). In each industry, sufficient water is essential to successfully sustain production activities. In Jordan, however, water scarcity is a severe problem (Hadadin, Qaqish, Akawwi, & Bdour, 2010 ; Ministry of Water & Irrigation, 2016a, 2016b ). Jordan's overdependence on imported energy and its escalating energy demand have become critical problems to the country's ability to secure a stable energy supply (Al-Bajjali & Shamayleh, 2018 ; Al-Omary, Kaltschmitt, & Becker, 2018 , Ministry of Energy & Mineral Resources, 2016 ). “Jordan has embarked on implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) despite the numerous challenges that Jordan is currently facing” (United Nations, 2018c ). According to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Index and Dashboard Report (2017) published by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, Jordan has been ranked 80th  country worldtwide (Sachs et al., 2017 ) Therefore, the contribution of sustainable buildings to achieve the UN SDGs is essential. However, a majority of certified green and sustainable buildings under LEED certification system (US Green Building Council, 2018a, 2018b, 2018c, 2018d ; US Green Building Council, 2018e ) in Jordan are non-residential, such as office buildings, embassies, and schools. In Jordan, the number of non-residential buildings is rapidly increasing; the average number of permits that were granted to such buildings reached 1003 annually from 2009 to 2016 (Department of Statistics, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017a, 2017b ). These types of buildings utilize considerable amounts of water and energy in their daily operations (US Department of Energy, 2018; US Environmental Protection Agency, 2018 ). Hence, there is a growth potential in the construction of sustainable non-residential building in Jordan with a vital business case to be made for water and energy efficiency. At present, there is no existing sustainable building assessment tool that describes the relationship between its assessment criteria for sustainable buildings and the UN SDGs; accordingly, there is a dearth of information and insight on this important subject. Moreover, the contributions of sustainable buildings to achieve the UN SDGs in Jordan have not been previously assessed. Therefore, this research aims to develop a new framework to integrate the UN SDGs into the assessment and management of sustainable non-residential buildings in Jordan. The main objectives are as follows:1. Identify the appropriate categories and indicators for the assessment and management of sustainable non-residential buildings in Jordan.  2. Develop an integrated weighting system for the assessment indicators based on the significance of sustainability problems in Jordan and contributions to achieve the UN SDGs.  3. Determine the integration of assessment indicators in the project phases  4. Validate the proposed framework.    Subsequent to this introduction, an overview on the key assessment categories in the existing sustainable building assessment tools is discussed in Section 2 . In Section 3 , the methods performed in this research are outlined. Section 4  presents the results and discussion. Finally, Section 5  provides the conclusion.  2 Key assessment categories in literature and among international green building rating tools Several recent studies suggest that the development process of new assessment methods for sustainable buildings should begin with a comparative study of the international building sustainability assessment tools (Ali & Al Nsairat, 2009 ; Alyami & Rezgui, 2012 ; Alyami, Rezgui, & Kwan, 2013 ; Banani, Vahdati, Shahrestani, & Clements-Croome, 2016; Kamaruzzaman, Lou, Wong, Wood, & Che-Ani, 2018 ; Yu, Li, Yang, & Wang, 2015 ; Zarghami, Azemati, Fatourehchi, & Karamloo, 2018 ). Therefore, this study selected and reviewed six of the assessment tools that are widely used in various countries in five regions (America, Europe, Asia–Pacific, Africa, and Middle East and North Africa) to generate a preliminary list of assessment categories (main theme) and indicators (sub-theme). These assessment tools are as follows: BREEAM  (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology) (BREEAM, 2016 ); LEED v4 (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) (USGBC, 2014 ); CASBEE (Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency) (CASBEE, 2014 ); Green Star (GBCA, 2017 ); Green Mark (BCA, 2013 ); GBI (Green Building Index, 2011 ). Each of the aforementioned building assessment tools has similar and different sustainability assessment categories. In Table 1  , the different and similar categories of LEED, BREEAM, CASBEE, Green Star, Green Mark, and GBI are summarized. It should be noted that some terms used to describe the same category may vary in these tools; nevertheless, there are some key categories that are included in all the assessment tools. However, the weight assigned to each assessment category and each indicator differs based on the local conditions in order to consider the importance of each indicator for a particular country (Ding, 2008 ). Illankoon, Tam, Le, and Shen (2017)  reviewed and compared eight international green building rating tools and established seven key credit criteria for these rating tools as follows: (1) site, (2) energy, (3) water, (4) indoor environment quality, (5) materials, (6) waste and pollution, and (7) management. Fig. 2   shows that among these key criteria, “energy” is the most widely considered, followed by “indoor environment quality” and “water.” The social and economic problems in developing countries are more significant than those in the developed world (Cole, 2005 ). Therefore, a comprehensive review (Table 2  ) was conducted in several recent studies, which are related to the development of sustainable building assessment tools in developing countries (Ali & Al Nsairat, 2009 ; Alyami and Rezgui, 2012 ; Alyami et al., 2013; Banani et al., 2016; Kamaruzzaman et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2015; Zarghami et al., 2018 ). The list of assessment categories and indicators was obtained from these studies and thereafter compared and merged with those in the six selected international assessment tools; this consolidation ensured that all related and latest categories and indicators were identified. Accordingly, a preliminary list that contained 12 and 79 assessment categories and indicators, respectively, was generated. The proposed assessment categories are as follows: management, sustainable site, transport, indoor environment quality, water, waste, material, energy, pollution, innovation, economics, social, cultural, and service quality. This list was generated with the aim of providing a basis for the Delphi panel experts for brainstorming and thereafter formulating a new list of assessment categories and indicators that are suitable for developing sustainable non-residential buildings in Jordan.  3 Methodology This research is designed to develop a framework for integrating the UN SDGs into the assessment and management of sustainable non-residential buildings in Jordan. For this purpose, previous sustainable building rating systems and related researches were reviewed to generate a preliminary list of assessment categories and indicators, the Delphi technique was applied to identify assessment categories and indicators for sustainable non-residential building in Jordan. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and relative importance index (RII) methods were applied to develop integrated weighting system for assessment indicators based on Jordan significance of sustainability issues and contributions to UN SDGs. Additionally, questionnaire surveys were conducted to construct a classification system and identify the integration of assessment indicators in project phases. Finally, the proposed framework was validated by focus group discussion. In Fig. 3  , the methods used in this research are presented. Pilot studies were conducted prior to surveys to test the comprehensibility and suitability of the questionnaires. Pilot studies involved a team of two professors (academia), three associate professor (academia), and five experts (contracting company, consultancy firm and government authorities). All have experience with Jordan's built environment and sustainable buildings. Questionnaires were finalized based on feedback from pilot studies. 3.1 Delphi method The Delphi consultation technique was adopted to determine assessment categories and indicators that are appropriate for the assessment and management of sustainable non-residential building projects in Jordan. The method, which was established in the 1950s (Linstone & Turoff, 2002 ), attempts to establish an agreement among experts regarding a specific topic (Skulmoski, Hartman, & Krahn, 2007 ). This approach was selected for this study because the building assessment criteria are considered multidimensional; it is also a consensus-based approach (Chew & Das, 2008 ). Moreover, Delphi requires several rounds of surveys, which are conducted with experts in the field of research; through these iterative processes, experts can gain further insights. Furthermore, the Delphi method has been successfully implemented in studies on green and sustainable buildings (Alyami et al., 2013; Kamaruzzaman et al., 2018 ). The size and arrangement of the panel are imperative to successfully employ the Delphi method (Dalkey & Helmer, 1963 ; Delbecq, Van de Ven, & Gustafson, 1973; Okoli & Pawlowski, 2004 ; Rowe & Wright, 1999, 2011 ; Schmidt, Lyytinen, Keil, & Cule, 2001 ). Each panel must be sufficiently large to generate a diversity of perspectives (Delbecq et al., 1973 ); it may consist 10–50 experts. The Delphi experts are selected according to their knowledge, experience, professional qualification, and background in the field of research (Okoli & Pawlowski, 2004). In addition, the willingness of experts to participate is one of the important considerations because a few rounds of surveys are required for them to reach a consensus. Thus, in this study, 45 Jordanian experts were selected based on their experiences in the building construction industry and building sustainability assessment, involvement in Jordan Green Building Council, and willingness to participate in the Delphi process. Moreover, these experts were selected from different backgrounds to obtain diverse perspectives from a variety of professions: 31% from consultant companies, 33% from government authorities, 20% from contracting companies, and 16% from institutions and universities; these are summarized in Table 3   together with the demographics of the panel. A questionnaire was formulated to elicit perspectives on the 12 assessment categories and 79 assessment indicators that were identified in the literature review. A pilot study was then conducted prior to the survey to check whether the questionnaire is suitable and comprehensive. The pilot study involved a team of five professors (three of whom are associate professors (academia)) and five experts (from consultancy firm, contracting company and government authorities). All participants have experiences in the built environment and sustainable buildings in Jordan. The questionnaire was finalized based on the feedback obtained from the pilot study. The Delphi consultation process involves three rounds. In the first, second, and third rounds, 41, 36, and 34 experts have participated, respectively. The responses were collected on a Likert 5-point scale, ranging from “not important” to “very important.” In the first round, after a brief description, experts were asked to modify or add categories and indicators, or approve a list of rank assessment categories and indicators. Based on mean ranks, an introductory priority rank was established. Thereafter, a new questionnaire for round two was formulated based on the results obtained from round one. The second-round questionnaire survey was administered to experts, who revised and re-evaluated their initial opinions and judgements before checking the consensus. The feedback analyses exhibited that there were minimal changes in the opinion of each expert between the first and second rounds. Subsequently, a new questionnaire for round three was formulated based on the results obtained from round two; it contained assessment categories and indicators that are similar to the second-round questionnaire. In the third round, the results first and second-round questionnaires were summarized in order to obtain the experts’ perspectives as a “statistically-obtained group response” (mean or median). Thereafter, the questionnaire was administered to the Delphi panel for final judgements regarding the importance of the criteria, and analysis and consensus measurement were conducted afterwards. In this study, the mean and standard deviation approaches were selected to measure the consensus (AlQahtany, Rezgui, & Li, 2014 ; Vidal, Marle, & Bocquet, 2011; Von der Gracht, 2012 ).  3.2 AHP implementation The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was adopted in this study to develop the weights of assessment categories and indicators, which were determined by the Delphi consultation method; this reflects the local significance of sustainability problems in Jordan. Several studies have used the AHP as a research method to develop sustainable building assessments and thereby determine the importance of weightings of assessment categories and indicators (Alyami et al., 2013 ; Alyami, Rezgui, & Kwan, 2015 ; Banani et al., 2016 ; Kamaruzzaman et al., 2018 ; Yu et al., 2015 ; Zarghami et al., 2018 ). This method establishes varying levels of hierarchy (Saaty, 1990 ). In this study, the highest level (or goal) pertains to sustainable non-residential buildings; the two lower levels represent 12 categories and 75 indicators for the assessment of sustainable non-residential buildings in Jordan. The AHP is dependent on the pairwise comparisons between alternative indicators to establish their relative importance. A recommended 9-point comparison scale, which showed the level of relative importance by numbers, was utilized to convert the judgments of respondents into numerical quantities (Saaty, 2008; Saaty & Shang, 2007; Saaty & Vargas, 2005 ) The panel experts (the same participants in the Delphi process) were given 45 questionnaires; only 42 appropriate responses were gathered. All respondents had at least five years of professional experience, and 92% had over five years of work experience in the construction sector of Jordan. The experts were contacted individually to complete the questionnaire; their judgements were based on their work experience and the provided data on sustainable buildings. After the judgment matrix was created, the local priorities were then obtained, and the consistency of the outcome was determined. In order to overcome inconsistencies in ratings, consistency ratios (CRs) were calculated using Formulae (1) and (2) to measure the degree of contradictions in the judgment of each individual respondent (Ho, 2008; Yu et al., 2015 ).(1) Consistency   Ratio = C I  R I       (2) Consistency   Index : C I = λ m a x   − n  n − 1       where λ max   = the largest eigenvalue of matrix and N = number of factors compared in the questionnaire. If CR < 0.10, then the AHP judgment matrix is consistent. Therefore, the judgment matrices of 39 experts with CRs below 0.1 were chosen in this study. These individual judgments were converted to a group judgment by determining their geometric mean. Accordingly, new AHP pairwise comparison matrices were formed, and the local weights were thereafter calculated; moreover, the consistency of the group judgment was checked. The global weight and the overall weight of each assessment indicator were calculated by multiplying the local weight of each assessment category and the local weight of each of its assessment indicators. The process used in this study to obtain the AHP weights is illustrated in Fig. 2 .  3.3 RII method implementation The relative importance index (RII) is a method to rank different factors (Hossen, Kang, & Kim, 2015 ) and was applied to estimate the weights of identified assessment indicators of sustainable non-residential buildings in Jordan according to their contributions to achieve the UN SDGs. To evaluate the assessment indicators, a 5-point Likert scale was utilized (varying from “very low” to “very important”). A total of 45 questionnaires were sent to the experts who participated in the Delphi process. If the average value of responses was significantly greater than 3 (P-value <0.05), a significant relationship between the assessment indicators and the UN SDGs is assumed. The RII was calculated only if a significant relationship between assessment indicators and the UN SDGs was identified; it was calculated for each assessment indicator using Eq. (3)  (Durdyev, Zavadskas, Thurnell, Banaitis, & Ihtiyar, 2018 ; Iwaro, Mwasha, Williams, & Zico, 2014 ). The geometric mean of the RII values of all the assessment indicators was calculated. A higher RII value implies a stronger contribution to the UN SDGs in Jordan.(3) RII = ∑ i = 1  n  W i    A N       where W  = each contribution weigh provided by respondents, A  = the highest weight (5) in this study and N  = total number of respondents (37) in this study.  3.4 Integrated weighting system Unsustainable building development and low progress in achieving the UN SDGs are ongoing problems in Jordan. Therefore, this research proposes a new innovative integrated weight (combination of AHP and RII methods) technique, which can maintain the focus of the sustainable building assessment framework on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals while solving building sustainability problems according to a country's specific context. The combined AHP–RII methodology was used by Hossen et al. (2015)  to assess the construction schedule delay risk. The integrated weight of assessment indicators is calculated, as shown in Fig. 4  .  3.5 Classification system To determine a suitable rating and classification system, the panel of experts were interviewed and were asked to respond to questionnaires. There were three short questions: (1) What are the best types of building classifications based on the degree of contribution to achieve the UN SDGs, metals or stars? (2) Which scores or percentage should non-residential buildings in Jordan achieve in order to be classified as a sustainable building? (3) What is the percentage of the achievement of assessment indicators?  3.6 Identification of integration between indicators and project phases The panel of experts (the same participants in the Delphi process) were asked to respond to questionnaires; 36 Jordanian experts participated. The aim of conducting these surveys was to obtain suggestions and recommendations from the professionals in the construction industry sector of Jordan on how to integrate assessment indicators into the project management processes. To represent the start, development, and end phases of each indicator, a Gantt chart was used; this includes various bars, which indicate the extent that the indicators were considered throughout the start and end phases.  3.7 Framework validation through focus group discussion A focus group discussion technique was employed to validate the results and proposed framework. Krueger, a leader in focus group discussion method, suggested that 5–10 participants be selected (Krueger, 2014 ). Thus, 10 Jordanian building project experts (male and female) from different backgrounds (consultants, contractors, government officials, and academic experts from universities) were selected based on their expertise, role, and experience. Moreover, they have theoretical and practical experiences in sustainable building projects.   4 Results and discussion 4.1 Framework of sustainable non-residential building assessments in Jordan Based on the consensus of the Delphi panel, a framework with two hierarchy levels was constructed (Table 4  ). The first level consists of 12 main categories: energy, water, indoor environment quality, materials, sustainable site, transport, waste management, pollution, economics, service quality, and social and cultural aspects. The second level consists of 75 assessment indicators. The standard deviations of the main assessment categories and indicator ranges are less than 1 (0.28–0.73); these ranges indicate a consensus among the experts (AlQahtany et al., 2014; Vidal et al., 2011; Von der Gracht, 2012 ). 4.1.1 Water efficiency The water efficiency category has the main objective to “reduce the amount of potable water consumed in buildings.” Because Jordan is a country that suffers from water scarcity, potable water is of highest priority (Ministry of Water & Irrigation, 2016a, 2016b ); thus, it is necessary for experts to include this category and its assessment indicators. In order to protect potable water, it is necessary to implement waste prevention and several strategies, such as rainwater harvesting, water-efficient landscape, graywater recycling, water-efficient fixtures, water leak detection and prevention, and water metering and monitoring. The standard deviations of this category and its assessment indicators were within the range 0.42–0.73 (less than 1), as summarized in Table 4 .  4.1.2 Energy efficiency The experts agreed that sustainable buildings can save energy by means of two solutions: reduce the required amount of energy for building operations and utilize more green and clean forms of energy. If a building has a better energy performance, then the environmental impacts (such as greenhouse gas emissions from energy production) caused by its energy consumption are diminished, and operating costs are reduced. The standard deviations of the energy category and its assessment indicators are within the range 0.31–0.73 (less than 1), as summarized in Table 4 .  4.1.3 Indoor environment quality Creating healthier indoor environments reduces health problems, increases productivity, and improves the well-being of occupants. The Delphi panel experts have agreed to solve the indoor environment quality of buildings in Jordan for the health of occupants. The indoor environment quality assessment indicators promote the use of several methods that can mitigate indoor pollutants with an attempt to limit the exposure of occupants to these harmful substances: specify materials that release volatile organic compounds (VOCs); maintain optimal air quality; increase air ventilation rates; provide view and natural light; enhance light and noise controllability. The standard deviations of the indoor environment quality category and its assessment indicators are within the range 0.35–0.69 (less than 1), as summarized in Table 4 .  4.1.4 Sustainable site Construction activities can affect air quality, which impacts plants, animals, and humans. Therefore, the Delphi panel experts agreed that site selection and development are vital components of sustainability because buildings and its construction activities have detrimental effects on natural habitat. Thus, the assessment indicators of this category discourage the development of previously undeveloped land; moreover, these aim to minimize the effect of buildings on ecosystems and encourage construction on previously developed lands. The standard deviations of this category and its assessment indicators are within 0.51–0.64 (less than 1), as listed in Table 4 .  4.1.5 Transportation The objective of the transportation category is to alleviate congestion and air pollution caused by private vehicles. The assessment indicators of this category encourage the reduction of car park capacity and advocate the use of public transport and vehicles with low emissions to building occupants. The standard deviations of this category and its assessment indicators are within 0.51–0.59 (less than 1), as summarized in Table 4 .  4.1.6 Materials The Delphi expert panel agreed that sustainable building requires strategies and policies for materials and responsible construction. The assessment indicators of this category can be divided into material selection, efficient use of material, disclosure information, and use of green products. Table 4  summarizes the standard deviations of this category and its assessment indicators within the range 0.45–0.69 (less than 1).  4.1.7 Management A total of 11 assessment indicators for management were identified by the Delphi expert panel. The management of construction process and integration of assessment indicators in project phases were deemed as important considerations. The standard deviations of this category and its assessment indicators are within 0.56–0.73 (less than 1), as listed in Table 4 .  4.1.8 Pollution The pollution category aims to mitigate the outdoor sources of air pollution and thereby limit its effect. The experts agreed that sustainable construction should take into consideration ways to minimize its effects on the surrounding environment to protect it. Moreover, they have agreed that heat island effect, CO2  and NOX  emissions, impact of refrigeration, night light pollution, noise pollution, and watercourse pollution should be taken into account because of their adverse effects on the surrounding environment. The standard deviations of this category and its assessment indicators are within 0.35–0.66 (less than 1), as listed in Table 4 .  4.1.9 Waste management According to the experts, because wastes are hazardous to human health and environment, this category should be comprehensively considered in the assessment of sustainable buildings to ensure the best practice in managing construction and operational wastes. Three assessment indicators were identified for this category: construction waste management, waste recycling facilities, and operational waste management. The standard deviations of this category and its assessment indicators are within the range 0.54–0.68 (less than 1), as listed in Table 4 .  4.1.10 Economics According to the expert panel, economics should be regarded in the evaluation of sustainable buildings based on the development principle because generating financial returns are perceived as fundamental in all building projects. Two assessment indicators were identified: life cycle cost and operation and maintenance cost. The standard deviations of this category and its assessment indicators are within 0.35–0.56 (less than 1), as summarized in Table 4 .  4.1.11 Social and cultural values The foundation of sustainability includes the social aspect. Thus, the experts agreed that the social and cultural value category and its assessment indicators are relevant themes for sustainable buildings in Jordan. There are two identified assessment indictors in this category: first, the design must be compatible with cultural values while considering local context and characters; second, the preservation of heritage values and building amenities should be taken into consideration to benefit building occupants and their social well-being. The standard deviations of this category and its assessment indicators are within the range 0.40–0.69 (less than 1), as listed in Table 4 .  4.1.12 qQuality of service The experts perceived service functions as vital to maintain good building condition over an extended time period. The assessment indicators of this category take into account the efficiency of the floor area that is allocated for the required functions as well as flexibility and adaptability, which promote the implementation of measures to accommodate future changes in building usage. These modifications may be necessary because of various factors, such as change of ownership or future expansion and growth. Additionally, design preservation is deemed important to ensure that the building itself can be maintained throughout its life cycle. The standard deviations of this category and its assessment indicators are within the range 0.55–0.73 (less than 1), as listed in Table 4 .   4.2 Weights of assessment indicators based on significance of sustainability problems in Jordan AHP method gives the local weight of each assessment category and indicator as well as the global weight of each assessment indicator are obtained; the global weight is calculated by multiplying the local weights of the main assessment category and its indicators. The overall inconsistency of the main goal is 0.02; hence, judgments are highly consistent. Table 3  summarizes the local and global weights (obtained by the AHP) of 12 assessment categories and 75 assessment indicators for sustainable non-residential buildings in Jordan; the results reflect the local situation. Among the global weights of assessment indicators, it is evident from the list in Table 5   that “potable water consumption” has the highest global weight (0.037); its main objective is to “reduce the amount of potable water consumed in buildings.” This result is consistent with the local significance of sustainability problems in Jordan. Because Jordan experiences water scarcity and potable water is extremely important, potable water consumption was given the highest priority among all assessment indicators.  4.3 Weights of assessment indicators based on its contributions to achieve UN SDGs The weight values of indicators (based on the RII values) according to their contributions to achieve the UN SDGs are summarized in Table 6  . Assessment indicators contribute significantly to SDG3, SDG6–SDG9, SDG11–SDG13, and SDG15. Notably, renewable energy technology has the highest weight (0.98) based on its contributions to SDGs 7–9 and 12–13 in Jordan. The primary source of electricity in Jordan is natural gas (70%). In addition, certain power plants continue to utilize heavy fuel oil and diesel which is one of main reason for global greenhouse gas emmisions (UNEP, 2018c ) The residential sector accounts for 43% of the total electricity consumption, followed by the industrial (25%), commercial (15%), water pumping (15%), and street light (2%) sectors. The buildings in Jordan consume approximately 58% of the total national electricity (Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources 2015). Electricity generation from sources other than fossil fuels further reduces the environmental impacts caused by the energy consumption of buildings. The implementation of renewable energy technologies in sustainable buildings stimulates job creation in design, manufacturing, construction, maintenance, and operations. Therefore, in this study, the experts agreed that the implementation of renewable energy technology in sustainable buildings can significantly contribute to achieve the SDGs.  4.4 Integrated weight of assessment indicators The integrated weight of indicators based on the significance of sustainability problems and their contributions to achieve the UN SDGs (SDG3, SDG6–SDG9, SDG11–SDG13, and SDG15) in Jordan are summarized in Table 7  . The results exhibit that potable water consumption has the highest integration weight, which indicates the water scarcity condition in Jordan; these are consistent with the situation in Jordan and the significant function of water to achieve the UN SDGs. According to the UN, “Water is at the core of sustainable development and is critical for socio-economic development, healthy ecosystems and for human survival itself. It is vital for reducing the global burden of disease and improving the health, welfare and productivity of populations.”(United Nations, 2018d ) Water scarcity is a critical problem that affects the well-being, security, and economic future of all Jordanians (Ministry of Water & Irrigation, 2016a, 2016b ). Hence, the mitigation of potable water consumption in buildings should be given the highest priority.  4.5 Classification system Analysis of the questionnaire survey indicates that all experts who participated in this survey agreed that the percentage of the achievement of assessment indicators to be as following:(1) Not achieved = 0,  (2) Partially Achieved = 50%  (3) Achieved = 100%    Therefore, the following rating formulas and classification system of buildings were constructed:(4) Indicator   Score = Achievement   %   *   Weight   %   of   Assessment   Indicator      Achievement % is the percentage of the achievement of assessment indicators (Not achieved = 0, Partially Achieved = 50%, Achieved = 100%) Weights % of assessment indicator is the integrated weights % of assessment indicators as in Table 7 .(5) Total   Building   Score = ∑ Indicators   Scores       Most of expert agreed that rating and classification system of sustainable non-residential building in Jordan should be based on the level of contributions to achieve UN SDGs as shown in Table 8   and Fig. 5  .  4.6 Integration of assessment indicators into project phases The survey analysis shows that the majority of the experts agreed that the assessment indicators of sustainable buildings influence all project phases as shown in Table 9  . The design phase and the technical design sub-phase are particularly influenced by most assessment indicators. Based on the data, the “involvement of stakeholders” should be considered from the start to the finish of the project. Moreover, “CO2  mitigation strategy” and “potable water consumption” influence all project phases; however, sustainable site indicators focus on on-site features and have no influence on the building itself. Therefore, all sustainable site indicators should be considered when making decisions on the development of sustainable building projects. In addition, the integration of assessment indicators into project management also renders the projects of sustainable buildings more appealing because these have lower risks and costs.  4.7 Validation 4.7.1 Validation of results The focus group discussion included the findings of the identified assessment categories, indicators of sustainable non-residential buildings in Jordan, weight of each category and indicator, integration of assessment indicators into project phases, and sustainable building classification system. The respondents were asked to answer Yes/No questions, and thereafter provided their opinions regarding the obtained results (if these results are reasonable, reliable, or both). The experts debated on the applicability of assessment indicators and their integration into project phases, as well as whether the implementation of identified indicators in the Jordanian context is easy or difficult. Moreover, they deliberated on the sustainable building classification system in Jordan and the targets of each UN SDG. After an extensive discussion, all the experts approved the results of the study. They stated that these are reasonable and reliable; therefore, the results were validated.  4.7.2 Framework validation A developed framework is provided for the focus group. The experts provided their opinions about how easy or difficult the developed framework is. They gave their opinions on its robustness and how it is compatible with the Jordanian conditions, context, and environment. Table 10   illustrates the focus group respondents’ responses. All the 10 participants in the focus group discussion approved the framework's simplicity and compatibility with the environment and conditions in Jordan; moreover, they agreed that the suggested framework contributes to gain further insights on the contributions of sustainable buildings to achieve the UN SDGs in Jordan. Nine members (90%) approved the research method employed to construct the proposed framework because of its reliability. Hence, this can guide researchers as well as policymakers worldwide to develop new sustainable building assessment systems for various building types (such as residential buildings) in any country or to update the existing sustainable building assessment system. However, among the participants, one expert expressed doubts on whether this research method can be adopted to construct the framework. Accordingly, the proposed framework is validated. Nine members of the focus group (90%) agreed that the developed management tool (Gantt chart) will aid in implementing sustainable project management and eliminating related barriers to the construction of sustainable buildings in Jordan; one member was uncertain. Accordingly, the proposed framework was validated by means of a focus group discussion.    5 Conclusion Worldwide, governments have developed strategies to achieve the UN SDGs, and sustainable buildings can perform a significant function in this regard. Currently, there is a lack of information on this topic because no existing building assessment system describes the relationship between its assessment indicators and the UN SDGs. This is the first study to propose a framework for integrating the UN SDGs into the assessment and management of sustainable buildings. In this research, 12 assessment categories and 75 indicators were identified by a three-round Delphi consultation; consensus is achieved in the third round. In this research, a new innovative integrated weight (combination of AHP and RII methods) that can maintain the focus of the sustainable building assessment framework on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals while solving building sustainability problems according to a country's specific context is proposed. Based on the results obtained by means of the AHP and RII, “Potable water consumption” exhibited the highest rank, whereas “Building occupants’ guide, awareness, and education” was given the lowest priority. A classification system for sustainable non-residential buildings was constructed, and the integration of assessment indicators and project management process was identified by experts. The results show that all assessment indicators influence project phases. A new management tool (Gantt chart) was proposed; it aims to aid project stakeholders in implementing sustainable project management and eliminate related barriers in developing sustainable buildings in Jordan. The validation by means of a focus group discussion showed that the experts agreed that the proposed framework is reliable and practical for researchers and policymakers worldwide. It is necessary for governments, designers, and developers to acquire more information and determine which aspect should be focused on to maximize the contribution of sustainable buildings toward achieving the UN SDGs. Hence, it is important for policymakers and practitioners in Jordan to use the proposed framework. This study provides insights and guidelines that can aid the government to formulate, adopt, evaluate, or update the existing green building guidelines and standards in order to focus more on achieving the UN SDGs. The proposed framework can be used by various stakeholders, such as the government, developers and project practitioners to assess sustainable non-residential buildings. More importantly, the proposed framework will guide researchers and policymakers worldwide for developing new sustainable building assessment systems or updating the existing sustainable building assessment system. The findings in this research can potentially assist in formulating building assessment tools and achieving the UN SDGs in countries other than Jordan. Although this study achieved the objectives mentioned in the introduction, there were limitations. First, this study only considered the non-residential buildings in Jordan. However, the findings of this study can be considered as a guideline to develop a framework for assessing and managing other types of sustainable buildings. Second, the number of experts who participated in each stage of this research is less than 42; therefore, the results from each stage may slightly differ if the number of participants change. The absence of a previously developed framework and the limited information on the subject constitute the third limitation, which hindered the comparison of the proposed framework in this study with other existing framework or tools. In summary, the contribution of sustainable buildings to achieve the UN SDGs can be maximized by integrating these into the assessment and management of sustainable buildings.
