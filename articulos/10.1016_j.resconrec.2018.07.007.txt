                  Natural Resources are essential inputs for economic and social development. However, unsustainable resource use has led to environmental degradation and resource depletion, endangering the well-being of humanity and the environment. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent a plan of action to address these issues. The Green Economy (GE) concept is described by various institutions as a vehicle to move towards sustainable resource management. This paper demonstrates the linkages between SDGs and Natural Resources though the systematic analysis of 494 GE indicators, derived from 12 distinct frameworks focusing on GE or on Green Growth. This articulation provides insights to gain an improved understanding of the links between SDGs and Natural Resources and interpret their inherent complexity. GE indicators focus unevenly on SDG, although each SDG is related to at least one resource category. Two complementary typologies were applied to the Materials subcategory to highlight additional characteristics, leading to the proposal of an adaptable analytical framework for the assessment of sustainability issues and GE transitions.

Natural Resources are essential inputs for economic and social development. However, unsustainable resource use has led to environmental degradation and resource depletion, endangering the well-being of humanity and the environment. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent a plan of action to address these issues. The Green Economy (GE) concept is described by various institutions as a vehicle to move towards sustainable resource management. This paper demonstrates the linkages between SDGs and Natural Resources though the systematic analysis of 494 GE indicators, derived from 12 distinct frameworks focusing on GE or on Green Growth. This articulation provides insights to gain an improved understanding of the links between SDGs and Natural Resources and interpret their inherent complexity. GE indicators focus unevenly on SDG, although each SDG is related to at least one resource category. Two complementary typologies were applied to the Materials subcategory to highlight additional characteristics, leading to the proposal of an adaptable analytical framework for the assessment of sustainability issues and GE transitions.   Keywords Green economy  SDGs  Natural resources  Sustainability  Indicators  Green growth    1 Introduction Natural resources are fundamental building blocks of socio-economic systems from the local to the global scale and shape the well-being of humanity, the environment and the economy (IRP, 2017a ). Unsustainable Natural Resource use has however led to environmental degradation, to the point that human actions have become the main driver of environmental change in the global Earth system and are putting pressure on multiple planetary boundaries (Rockström et al., 2009 ). Given the crucial role played by Natural Resources (NRs) in economic activities (Bakshi et al., 2011 ), there is global consensus on the need to sustainably manage NRs so that the planet may support the needs of the present and future generations (UN, 2015 ), while avoiding excessive disruption of local and global environmental systems (IRP, 2017b ). In 2015, the international community devised the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity, addressing the issues of environmental degradation and resource depletion that exacerbate the challenges faced by humanity. In this context, the 2030 Agenda contains a set of seventeen integrated and indivisible Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), 169 associated targets and as of end 2017, 232 indicators, intended to stimulate action over the 2015–2030 time period in areas of critical importance for humanity and the planet (UN, 2017 ). In practice, even if the interconnection between NRs and Sustainable Development has been noted since many years (MA, 2005 ; Stern Review, 2007 ; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007 ), the relations between NR-based frameworks and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development are far from explicit. To date, very few studies have explored how such an integration can be concretely achieved at a systemic scale and within a common conceptual or evaluative framing. Bringezu et al. (2016)  conceptually crossed SDGs with resource use “challenges and risks ”, while Hák et al. (2016)  combined both concepts with additional frameworks. The concept of Green Economy (GE) is often defined as one “that results in improved human well-being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities” (UNEP, 2011 ) and is seen by the EEA as a requirement for sustainably managing natural resources (EEA, 2012 ). Being inextricably linked to both SDGs and NRs, GE could serve as a pathway to sustainable resource management with the objective to meet the needs of present and future generations. The pertinence of this triangulation is also illustrated by the bibliometric analysis carried out by Loiseau et al. (2016) . According to these authors, “sustainable development” and “resources” are the two most frequent keywords related to the GE concept in the scientific literature since 1990. Thus, GE may be the “mortar” needed to assemble these two concepts and solidify the resulting composite framework. However, there is no universally accepted definition for the GE concept, which has led to a multiplicity of definitions and related frameworks, including some focusing on the concept of Green Growth (GG) (OECD, 2017 ). The present paper addresses the following research questions:• How SDG and NR typologies may be coherently and efficiently articulated for improving current measurement systems?  • What SDG-NR interlinkages characterize the GE concept? Are they consistent with the existing definitions of the GE concept?  • How can the large amount of available indicators and concomitant frameworks be more effectively used for improved governance in the fields of sustainability and green transitions?    To handle such questions, this research used a particular perspective on indicators, derived from measurement frameworks focusing on the GE or GG concept. Indicators are most often conceived as parameters that provide information about the state of a system (UN, 1997 ). Depending on the context in which they are used, indicators can be relatively broad, encompassing multiple components, as well as very detailed specific attributes, representing the specific data that is collected (Heink and Kowarik, 2010 ). Moving “from data to information ” (Stanners et al., 2007 ), this research recognizes indicators as epistemological markers presenting a particular “story ” through embeded ideas, discourses or arguments (Stanners et al., 2007 ; O’Connor and Spangenberg, 2008 ). Indicators are thus not exclusively seen as parametrical descriptions or through the explicit data they provide, but also through their underlying signification, as pieces of a “conversation ” (Bell and Morse, 2001 ). When conceived in that way, indicators may be remarkably useful to elucidate which features and aspects better characterize ambiguous concepts, as well as to detangle complex interrelated issues (Merino-Saum, 2015 ). The paper is structured as follows. Section 2  presents the methodology applied. Section 3  sheds a light on all the data gathered through our indicators screening and their subsequent analysis. Section 4  consists of the quantitative results obtained through data analysis; the focus progressively moves from (i) SDGs to (ii) NRs and is finally placed on an (iii) articulation of these two concepts through a specific focus on material resources. Section 5  provides a discussion based on previous results. Section 6  concludes.  2 Conceptual framing and methodological issues 2.1 The GE concept, at the crossroads of SDGs and NRs The proximity between GE and Sustainable Development was explicitly and rapidly underlined when the former re-emerged in the late 2000s through the Green Economy Initiative  (2008) and the Global Green New Deal  (2009), both of them launched by UNEP. Indeed, the GE was institutionally presented as a “vehicle ” to deliver Sustainable Development (UNEP, 2012 ), and was even perceived by some authors as a “child ” of Sustainable Development (Jacobs, 2012 ) whose birth derived more from pragmatic choices than from a clear conceptual differentiation. As UNEP (2011)  points out in its widely quoted Green Economy Report , “moving towards a GE must become a strategic economic policy agenda for achieving Sustainable Development ”. GE is thus often presented in the scientific literature as an institutional tentative to: (i) overcome the decreasing traction that Sustainable Development was experiencing over the first decade of current century (Jacobs, 2012 ); (ii) promote rapid action at times of crisis (Bina and La Camera, 2011 ); and (iii) build a consensus in the occasion of Rio+20 (Bina, 2013 ). In more recent times, the need for establishing concrete and explicit links between GE and SDGs has been underlined by PAGE (2017) , whose Green Economy Progress Index  is made of indicators unambiguously correlated to most of the 17 SDGs. The interconnection between GE and NRs is as much evident. According to UNEP (2012) , resource efficiency represents one of the cross-cutting thematic priorities that GE indicators should always cover. For EEA, resource efficiency was seen from the beginning as a “necessary criterion ” for GE (EEA, 2011 ). More recently, in its 7th Environment Action Programme, EEA consider “to turn the Union into a resource-efficient, green and competitive low-carbon economy ” as one of its three priority objectives (EEA, 2016 ). In a similar way, the TEEB sees “measures for eco-efficiency and wider resource efficiency ” and “decoupling the economy from resource use and its negative impacts ” as two of the six fundamental building blocks in the transition to a GE (ten Brink et al., 2012 ). OECD also explicitly refers to resources when defining Green Growth and sees “resource efficiency ” as one its four key objectives (OECD, 2011 ). For the World Bank, Green Growth is also “one that is efficient in its use of natural resources, clean in that it minimizes pollution and environmental impacts and resilient in that it accounts for natural hazards”  (World Bank, 2012 ).  2.2 Sample description The research team defined the sample in two subsequent phases. The first one, primarily heuristic, aimed at opening up the spectrum of potentially pertinent measurement frameworks. The second phase attempted to close down the set of conceivable inputs by concretely determining those to be included in the final sample. A literature review was carried out on scientific papers as well as diverse documents from grey literature in relation to GE. Measurement frameworks were methodically collected and screened through a set of basic criteria (Table A1 , in Appendix A). During this first phase, the research team also informally consulted several members from international institutions working on GE indicators. Once all potential measurement frameworks had been identified (“snowball sampling ” technique), the focus was placed on the concrete delimitation of sample’s boundaries. Potential frameworks were included or excluded into the final sample according to the following criteria:(i) The scope was voluntarily placed on institutional sources (i.e. reports; policy briefs; working papers; technical notes; etc.). In that sense, the GE concept originally emerged from the scientific field of Environmental Economics  (Pearce et al., 1989 ). However, since the 2008 global financial crisis, it has been primarily articulated and principally fostered by international organizations such as UNEP, World Bank, EEA and OECD (Borel-Saladin and Turok, 2013 ; Ferguson, 2015 ; Anderson et al., 2016 ; Loiseau et al., 2016 ; Georgeson et al., 2017 ). The concept is particularly well established in the international political sphere where it has drawn strong attention and mobilized significant financial means. The later progressively implied great impetus to concomitant initiatives aimed at measuring, monitoring and benchmarking transition towards GE.  (ii) The research team only considered multidimensional frameworks that address GE in general and do not exclusively focus on particular sectors, environmental issues or economic activities. Frameworks having such a specific focus were excluded from the final sample.  (iii) Only those frameworks adding significant novelty to the field of GE indicators were taken into account. The research team estimated the originality of each potential framework according to not only the indicators concretely selected, but also the overall framing and the particular focus chosen. Therefore, applications at national level of previous measurement frameworks suggested by international institutions were not considered (even if they slightly adapt the original framework to the particular context of the country at hand). In the same way, simple replications or updates of previous frameworks by a same organization were also excluded.    The consideration of all previous criteria led to a final sample of 12 measurement frameworks suggested by 10 different organizations from 2011 to 2017. Fig. 1   shows that most of these are suggested by international institutions and present indicators in a disaggregated manner.  2.3 Typologies Once all indicators were collected and catalogued from the 12 selected frameworks, the research team started their systematic screening through several complementary typologies. The focus being on resource management and sustainability, the four following typologies seemed particularly suitable for the present study. 2.3.1 UN SDGs The indicators found in the studied GE frameworks were categorized according to the most related of the 17 SDGs. It is worth noting that even if SDGs are now well documented and widely used by institutions, corporations and academics in different scientific fields and political contexts, ambiguities still exist about their particular meaning, as well as the concrete and tangible content that make them univocally distinguishable from each other (Hák et al., 2016 ). Therefore, any implementation of the UN SDGs framework implies a degree of subjectivity and particular considerations about what the SDGs intend to monitor. To deal with this issue, the research team prioritized the information provided at the level of the 169 targets or 232 indicators underlying the 17 Goals.  2.3.2 Resource categories As NRs are key to the social and economic development of people, these need to be sustainably managed, but also clearly defined. There is however no common definition of NRs, while the number and type of resource varies from one institution to another (Milios, 2016 ). A commonly cited reference defining NRs is given by European Commission in their Roadmap for a Resource Efficient Europe (EC, 2011 ): “Resources are all the resources that are inputs into our economy ”. A more specific definition was provided by de Haes et al. (2002) , where the Earth’s NRs are seen as “objects of nature which are extracted by man and taken as useful input to most economic and other man-controlled processes ”. The IRP further defines NRs as “aspects of the natural world that have the capacity to produce goods and services that contribute to welfare ” (IRP, 2017b ). NRs are categorized in different ways varying from narrow sets focusing on raw materials to broader typologies englobing an amalgam of multidimensional services provided by natural ecosystems (Moll et al., 2005 ; Huysman et al., 2015 ; Bringezu et al., 2016 ; etc.). Scientific literature provides several illustrations of how resource use indicators may be categorized according to a finite set of basic resources categories (Giljum et al., 2011 ; Bringezu et al., 2016 ). The resource typology developed in this study is inspired from EC (2011) , Huysman et al. (2015) , Giljum et al. (2011) , BioIS (2012)  and Baedeker et al. (2015) . Applying these typologies directly would not have provided an accurate description of the GE indicators sample due to the large number of indicators with a more general focus. Therefore, the NR typology developed consists of the following twelve categories:• Abiotic Materials (minerals, metals, ores, and fossil fuels);  • Biotic Materials (crops, livestock, fish, timber and biomass);  • Unspecific Materials (indicators relating to more than three materials indistinctly);  • Water (freshwater and seawater);  • Air;  • Land and Soil;  • Biodiversity;  • Abiotic Renewable Energy Resources (solar, wind, hydrological, geothermal sources, etc.);  • Unspecific Energy Resources (indicators relating to more than three energy resources indistinctly);  • Unspecific Resources (indicators relating to more than three resources indistinctly);  • NA (indicators not related to any of the resources listed above).     2.3.3 Environmental functions Environmental (or ecosystem) functions were first defined in de Groot (1992)  as the “capacity for natural processes and components to provide goods and services that satisfy human needs, directly or indirectly ”. This approach has subsequently been used and adapted in various studies, including the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA, 2005) , while some of these environmental functions are explicitly referred to in the OECD’s conceptual framework for GG (OECD, 2017 ). Various representations of these functions exist, such as Regulation, Habitat, Production, Information and Carrier functions (de Groot, 2006 ) or Resources, Waste absorption and Ecosystem services (Ekins, 2011 ). The typology used in this study is based on the five S’s ” as suggested in Noel and O’Connor (1998)  and O’Connor (2000) :• Source: corresponding to the characteristics of natural processes and components as sources of origin of NRs;  • Sink: relating to the regulating capacity (in terms of emissions, pollutants or other waste, for example) or NRs;  • Scenery: referring to the cultural, scientific, esthetic, recreational or symbolic value of NRs;  • Site: expressing the ability of NRs to provide space to support human activities (including all forms of land uses and occupation of space for transportation); and  • Life-Support: describing the capacity of NRs to provide refuge and reproduction habitat to non-human communities (fauna and flora).     2.3.4 MONET system approach The MONET project is an initiative aiming to set up a system of indicators which could be used to measure sustainable development in Switzerland (SFSO, 2004 ). The indicator classification developed is similar to the DPSIR framework (EEA, 1999 ), but is not tailored to environmental applications and therefore applicable to social and economic topics. The MONET approach is based on the six following types of indicators:• Level (L): measures the extent to which a need is met and not the continuous consumption of resources required for that purpose;  • Capital (C): estimates stocks and their accumulation or decline, but not consumption;  • Input/Output (Δ): relates to continuous consumption flows;  • Structural criteria:○ Efficiency subcategory (S₁): describes consumption in relation to the result, but never as an absolute value;  ○ Disparity subcategory (S₂): demonstrates distributions, but never average values for the total population;     • Response (R): relates to institutional measures taken in response to an undesirable development.      2.4 Indicators’ screening Each indicator was systematically screened by typology and considering all potential categories. The screening process was the same for all typologies: (i) team members read conceptual publications about the typology at hand; (ii) they individually screened the indicators; (iii) they discussed their results during rounds of collective working sessions; and finally, (iv) they checked internal consistency across results. The research team was voluntarily made of scientists with different backgrounds (economists, environmental scientists, engineers, etc.) in order to warrant interdisciplinarity and epistemological pluralism. As a rule, research team members determined the most pertinent category for each indicator and each typology. However, for those typologies made of non-exclusive categories, a same indicator was classified by referring to more than one category. For instance, the so-called indicator “protected areas ” was screened as being related as much to SDG 14 [Life below Water] as to SDG 15 [Life on Land]. In order to narrow the level of complexity, research team members could not relate a same indicator to more than three categories for a same typology. For certain indicators, it was not possible to screen them according to one or several typologies. In such cases, research team members simply considered them as “non-categorized” (NA).   3 Data The research team collected 494 “gross ” indicators into a database, derived from extracting indicators from the 12 reviewed measurement frameworks. Although the approach taken by each framework to represent their indicators varied, it was evident that multiple frameworks at times used identical indicators. This database of gross indicators was reduced into a “net”  indicator catalogue, which was the targeted basis for multi-typological screening. The assimilation of several gross  indicators was justified when at least one of the following two conditions was met:(i) two or more gross indicators are identically named;  (ii) two or more gross indicators have slightly different titles, but involve similar measurement units and/or analogous objects (independently from the levels of geographical or sectoral disaggregation).    Thus, “municipal and total amounts of waste generated by sector ” (Green Growth Knowledge Platform (GGKP), 2016 ), “generation of waste ” (Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), 2013 ) and “waste generation in Europe ” (EEA, 2016 ) were considered as duplicates and merged within a same net indicator subsequently named “waste generation ”. The conditions stated above represented the general rule to group or split indicators within and between frameworks, taking into account their internally varying levels of specificity or aggregation, and allowing for exceptional cases where additional ambiguities existed. After several rounds of duplicates checking, we arrived to a final set of 296 net indicators. The most frequently used net indicator are “energy intensity/productivity ” (9 frameworks), “waste generation ” (7 frameworks and “waste recycling ” (7 frameworks). The 14 most frequent net  indicators (4.7% of the net catalogue) are applied in 5 or more measurement frameworks and encompass 19.9% gross indicators (Table A2 , in Appendix A). Even though 218 net indicators (73.6%) englobe only one gross indicator (meaning that they are applied or suggested in only one framework), the distinction between gross and net indicators is crucial. This is particularly true when typologies are applied and aggregated results must be calculated. Gross indicators give a representative weighting to the indicators that are more frequently used than others, while net indicators give an equal weight to each indicator, irrespective of its presence in multiple frameworks. The research team took into account a second potential bias related to the different sizes that frameworks have. The number of indicators strongly varies across organizations and even between frameworks within the same organization. For instance, while NETGREEN (2013)  contains only 6 “headline”  indicators, GGKP (2016)  and UNESCAP (2013)  respectively encompass 79 and 68 indicators. Therefore, without additional calibration, measurement frameworks providing larger sets of indicators would influence the overall picture much more than those including less indicators. EEA and UNEP each published two frameworks with significantly different yet complementary approaches (EEA, 2012 , 2016 ; UNEP, 2012 ; PAGE, 2017 ). To avoid over-representing these institutions, a calibration was applied to their frameworks. The resulting indicators are hereafter referred to as “calibrated indicators” , which are those used for all further analysis, unless otherwise specified.  4 Results 4.1 Screening green economy indicators by SDGs As Fig. 2   illustrates, SDG 12 [Responsible Consumption and Production] is noticeably the most frequently related SDG across the measurement frameworks considered in the present study, as 74.27 calibrated indicators primarily refer to it, representing 15.03% of the sample. That represents approximately 1.5 times the amount of indicators found for the second and third most frequently related SDGs (SDG 7 [Affordable and clean energy]) and SDG 13 [Climate Action]). Such a dominance is particularly salient for some particular frameworks like UNESCAP (2013) , where SDG 12 covers more than one third of the entire set of indicators (33.64%) or UNEP (2012)  where it accounts for 26.83% indicators (Fig. A1 , in Appendix A). In brief, SDG 12 appears to be one of the core features assessed by GE indicators. This finding is significantly different from the results obtained by Geijzendorffer et al. (2017) , who also studied the number of indicators related to SDGs across several ecosystem services assessments. In this study, SDG 13 was the most frequently related SDG. As noted, SDG 7 and SDG 13 are also visibly strongly represented in GE measurement frameworks (respectively 10.80% and 10.59%). It is important to emphasize that SDG 13 is the only one systematically referred to in each measurement framework (Fig. A1  in Appendix A). Furthermore, the minimum relative attention registered for SDG 13 is 5.26% (PAGE, 2017 ), which is more than the global average calculated for almost one half of SDGs. More than one-third GE indicators (36.42%) are related to one of these three SDGs. The five most frequently related SDGs (SDGs 12, 7 and 13 as well as SDG 8 [Decent Work and Economic Growth] and SDG 11 [Sustainable Cities and Communities]) concentrate altogether more than half of all calibrated indicators (51.88%). The remaining twelve SDGs accounting for less than 50% of calibrated indicators shows that the integration of SDGs within GE measurement frameworks is disproportional. Among the twelve remaining SDGs, eight are particularly weakly represented (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 16 and 17), either because they are perceived as being immeasurable (Bell and Morse, 1999 ), intangible (Burford et al., 2016 ), or may not be considered as key issues for GE. SDGs 4 [Quality Education], 5 [Gender Equality] and 17 [Partnerships for the Goals] have been largely ignored by GE frameworks, as none of these three SDGs have exceeded a representation above 5% in any framework. These weakly represented SDGs primarily focus on the social dimension of sustainability (Barbier and Burgess, 2017 ), and therefore suggest that GE frameworks, despite their stated objectives of social inclusion, do not put a strong emphasis on the measurement of these issues. Although the five other weakly represented SDGs do not account for many indicators in our sample, particular attention is brought to them in certain frameworks. For instance, SDG 16 [Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions] accounts for only 3.15% calibrated indicators when all frameworks are taken together, but has a stronger relative importance in UNESCAP (2013) , where 10.29% gross indicators refer to it. Similarly, SDG 1 [No Poverty] is globally underrepresented (4.41% calibrated indicators), but is one of the six headline indicators suggested by NETGREEN (2013) .  4.2 Screening green economy indicators by natural resources (NRs) As shown in Fig. 3  , 83.4% calibrated GE indicators are directly related to NRs. These results confirm the emphasis put on resource use, efficiency and management in the GE arena. Most of the remaining 16.6%, representing 81.75 calibrated indicators relate to social-institutional dimensions (e.g. “literacy rate ”; “road traffic fatalities ”; “European quality of government index ”; “official development assistance (ODA) ”; etc.). A few unrelated indicators also refer to economic issues (e.g. “foreign direct investment ”; “labor productivity ”; etc.). As noted earlier, GE indicators largely refer to NRs. However, this link is most often unspecific: 40.92% calibrated indicators are indistinctly related to more than 3 NR categories. Hence, while these indicators have a link with NRs or with some aspects of them (e.g. availability, affordability, quality, related impacts, etc.), they do not explicitly refer to a limited number of specific resources. Some examples are “environmental protection expenditure ”, “ecological footprint ” or “green trade ”. As far as the remaining resource categories, several points seem worth noting:• Among NRs, GE measurement frameworks pay special attention to materials. As may be seen in Fig. 3 , indicators specifically referring to abiotic materials , biotic materials  and unspecific materials  cover altogether 10.09% calibrated indicators. Within this resource category, we may also underline that biotic materials  (6.02%) are represented three times as much as abiotic materials  (1.62%);  • Energy resources are also frequently referred to: unspecific energy resources  and abiotic renewable energy resources  account for 8.77% calibrated indicators. Some indicators categorized as dealing with biotic materials  are also related to energy resources (e.g. “technical bioenergy potential from residues ”);  • According to our results, water  (7.96%) is also frequently referred to in our sample and draws more attention than other resources such as land & soil  (6.01%), air (4.80%) or biodiversity  (4.71%);  • All specific resource categories are missing in at least one measurement framework. Abiotic materials  are the most frequently ignored one (no indicator refers to it in five different frameworks). Abiotic renewable energy resources on the other hand , while accounting for only 1.92% calibrated indicators, are missing in just one framework.    These results should be further studied by considering differences across frameworks: the percentages of related gross indicators for some resource categories (e.g. water ) vary from 0% to more than 20% depending on the measurement framework; (Fig. A2 , in Appendix A).  4.3 Articulation of SDGs with NATURAL RESOURCES 4.3.1 Global articulation The articulation between SDGs and NRs was conducted using calibrated indicators. In this application, a Sankey diagram (Fig. 4  ) has been used to visualize the multidimensional dataset, by highlighting the interconnections or “informational flows”  between SDGs and NR categories described above. The representation is inherently bidirectional and may be read from SDGs to NRs or inversely. Fig. 4  shows that some SDGs are strongly connected with specific NRs. The intuitive relation between SDG 6 [Clean Water and Sanitation] and water  is confirmed by our statistical analysis and well represented in the figure. Similarly, SDG 7 [Affordable and Clean Energy] and SDG 11 [Sustainable Cities and Communities] are respectively strongly linked to unspecific energy resources  and air . Some indicators related to SDG 7 are also connected to abiotic renewable energy resources  and biotic materials . These connections are explained by indicators relating to wind and solar energy technologies as well as energy from biomass. In other cases, SDGs and NRs are only partially interconnected to each other, leading to a web of intricate interrelationships. While land & soil  is largely connected to both SDG 2 [Zero Hunger] and SDG 15 [Life on Land], the latter is also predominantly associated to biodiversity  and biotic materials , which is in turn associated to SDG 14 [Life below Water] (in addition to the already noted SDGs 7 and 15). In that sense, the case of material resources (abiotic, biotic and unspecific Material ) seems particularly complex and will be further analyzed in Section 4.3.2 . It is important to note that all SDGs without exception are linked to some extent to NRs. Having said that, some of them are only weakly related to NRs and the related indicators mostly refer to the residual category (NA category in Fig. 4 ). This is particularly the case for SDGs 1 [No Poverty]; 3 [Good Health and Well-Being]; 10 [Reduced Inequalities] and 17 [Partnerships for the Goals].  4.3.2 Focus on unspecific resources  Fig. 4  also shows that, according to the definition of resources adopted, the category Unspecific Resources  is very broad. This category draws most of indicators also referring to SDGs 8, 9, 12, 13 and 16. To better understand the links between unspecific resources  and the SDGs, a new typology made of eleven subcategories was created and subsequently applied. The typology was inductively developed by the research team through keywords identification:• Human Resources;  • Macroeconomic Data;  • R&D - Innovation;  • Infrastructures;  • Waste and Recycling;  • Private Financial Resources;  • Green Sector and Sustainable Practices;  • Risk and Vulnerability;  • Public Measures;  • GHG Emissions;  • Others.    It is important to precise that such a typology did not rely on types of NR or specific SDGs; it is made of informative elements that consistently clarify what is “hidden” behind the unspecific resources  label. Fig. 5   represents a second Sankey Diagram to illustrate the connections between these subcategories and SDGs. As it was already the case for Fig. 4 , some direct links between SDGs and the keyword typology are visible. The relation between SDG 8 [Decent Work and Economic Growth] and macroeconomic data  is well represented. Similarly, SDG 9 [Industry, innovation and Infrastructure] and SDG 13 [Climate] are respectively strongly linked to R&D-innovation  and GHGs.  SDG 12 [Responsible Consumption and Production] related indicators, which are particularly frequent in GE frameworks (Section 4.1 ) and were mostly categorized as referring to unspecific resources  (Section 4.3.1 ), concern to a large extent three categories: waste and recycling ; green sector and sustainability practices ; and public measures . Fig. 5  also shows that indicators relating to Human Resources  (in terms of knowledge, information and capacity) and risk and vulnerability , have connections to six or more SDGs, highlighting their importance for achieving multiple goals.  4.3.3 Looking behind SDG-NR interlinkages through the case of materials The previously commented typologies were coupled with those based on environmental functions (Section 2.3.3 ) and the MONET system (Section 2.3.4 ) to provide additional dimensions of analysis. This was done to elucidate the extent to which these relationships have particular characteristics that differentiate them from other SDG-NR combinations. The analysis was applied to material resources, an important sub-system in GE frameworks (see Section 4.2 ) which also receives strong attention in both academia and policy-making (Behrens et al., 2007 ; Bringezu and Bleischwitz, 2009 ; Fischer-Kowalski et al., 2011 ). A bidirectional perspective (from NRs to SDGs, then SDGs to NRs) was used to illustrate potentially different characteristics of the SDG-NR interlinkages. The same reasoning was then applied to a particular SDG-NR combination within the material sub-system (i.e. indicators simultaneously referring to biotic materials  and SDG 7 [Affordable and Clean Energy]). As shown in Fig. 6  a, indicators relating to materials (abiotic , biotic  and unspecific ) predominantly refer to provisioning activities; i.e. “source ” function (70.8% calibrated indicators). At the opposite, the “scenery ” (2.7%) and “site ” (1.2%) environmental functions are particularly weakly represented. In terms of MONET categories, while distributional issues (“S₂”) are not at all present, S 1   , C and Δ categories cover all together more than 75% of the indicators at hand (Fig. 6 b). Results for the indicators referring to biotic materials  are disaggregated by most related SDGs to analyze potential differences across these subgroups (although indicators on biotic materials  are related to five SDGs, the four most represented SDGs account for 95% of them). As Fig. 6 c illustrates, the attention paid by these indicators to environmental functions significantly varies across SDGs. For instance, while indicators related to SDGs 2 [Zero Hunger] put strong emphasis on the “source ” function (83%), they have no link with the “scenery ”, “site ” and “sink ” functions. In addition to paying attention to the “source ” function, SDG 7 [Affordable and Clean Energy] and SDG 15 [Life on land] related indicators (60% and 37% respectively), also focus on the “sink ” function (32% and 23% respectively). These results derive among others from the interest of GE measurement frameworks on energy production from biomass (e.g. “Technical bioenergy potential from residues ”) and the importance associated to forest areas not only in terms of wood supply but also of long-term CO₂ capture and storage. Indicators referring to SDG 14 [Life below water] are also largely related to the “source ” function, as well as strongly linked to the “life-support ” function. Such results may be explained by the large number of indicators dealing with fishing activities. The analysis in terms of the MONET categories revealed additional divergences across SDGs (Fig. 6 d). A significant part of SDG 2 indicators refer to human needs (L; 33%) or social-institutional measures (R; 17%), while these features are neglected by most of the remaining indicators. In the same sense, resource flows (Δ) are particularly referred to by those indicators that also relate to SDGs 14 and 15 (29% and 12% respectively). The latter pay also special attention to Capital (C) (39% and 80% respectively). Such results illustrate the particular perspective of GE indicators on these two SDGs, which are largely associated to specific levels of natural capital and its consumption or depletion. Furthermore, the focus on efficiency (S₁) is more intense for those indicators concerning SDG 7 (48%) than for the remaining indicators (from 4% to 32%), revealing a particular standpoint on energy issues. When disaggregating SDG 7 related indicators, significant differences similarly exist across subcategories (Fig. 6 e and f), in particular in terms of MONET categories.    5 Discussion Previous studies have explored potential ways to articulate SDGs and NRs. Bringezu et al. (2016)  investigated how accounts on natural resource use can inform the SDGs and identified: (i) several key resource strategies; (ii) most probable challenges and risks in terms of resource use; and (iii) information required to enable actors to make knowledge-based decisions for more sustainable resource management. The study however was not based on empirical work; it aimed rather at opening the debate on these issues. Hák et al. (2016)  suggested a new framework aiming to operationalize the monitoring of SDGs. Their reasoning is illustrated through the example of SDG 12, for which they propose to explore candidate indicators by considering several NR categories and various life cycle stages. The present research goes beyond these two pioneering studies by transposing the theoretical discussion of the SDG-NR nexus onto a large sample of indicators and by providing consistent numerical estimations about existing interlinkages in the particular field of GE. As demonstrated in Section 4.3 , while some SDGs are almost uniquely associated to one particular NR, other SDG-NR interlinkages embed a web of intricate relations and multifaceted indicators. The simultaneous consideration of SDGs and NRs appeared to be a pertinent prism through which large amounts of multidimensional indicators may be screened and clustered. Our results shed a light on the particularly ambiguous GE concept and may support international organizations currently revising or developing GE measurement frameworks. The consideration of additional typologies in our study further demonstrates that the complexity embedded in all the “informational flows ” existing between SDGs and NRs derives not only from their multiplicity or from their various levels of intensity, but also from the intrinsic characteristics that each “flow”  potentially contains. This is particularly important for those SDGs and NRs, which are strongly connected to each other as these links may refer to different environmental functions. The manifold streams represented in the Sankey Diagrams bring explicit information about: (i) what  resource categories are being used; (ii) why  human societies use them (i.e. to achieve which goals?) and (iii) how  these resources are used to satisfy particular needs and expectations. While the first question focuses on the physical foundations of socio-economic systems, the second element emphasizes the justifications and expectations that such systems eventually prioritize. Such diagrams however, only implicitly address the third question, which refers to practical functional dimensions as illustrated in the analysis through the environmental functions and the MONET categories. In other words, while the SDG-NR prism seems necessary to explain large sets of sustainability or GE indicators, it may be not sufficient to identify additional valuable characteristics. The simultaneous consideration of the previously evoked ‘what’  (substantial), ‘why’  (teleological) and ‘how’  (instrumental) questions provides the basis for a tridimensional heuristic framing in which NR categories, SDGs and Environmental Functions could be coherently integrated and graphically represented through a cube (Fig. 7  ). Each data point in this tridimensional space would imply a particular narrative  (i.e. a concrete articulation of one NR, one SDG and one environmental function) and would embed a specific set of potential GE indicators. It is important to note that such a framing could be applicable either ex ante  or ex post  in sustainability assessments or GE evaluations, and that it could be helpful at both conceptual and empirical levels. It could be used for instance as a theoretical approach to investigate interrelated concepts such as GE, GG, Circular Economy or Low-carbon Economy. Several cubes, each constituting a graphic representation of a particular concept could then be compared. The framing could also serve as supportive tool orienting the development of new measurement frameworks, the selection of headline indicators within longer lists or dashboards, or even the adaptation of existing frameworks to local contexts such as downscaling global frameworks to national or subnational scales through participatory processes involving local actors or decision-makers. Finally, this framing could also be applied as a benchmarking tool enlightening differences among countries or cities in terms of GE transitions. Novel heuristic framings such as the one suggested in this paper are nowadays all the more needed as there exists an “indicator zoo ” (Pintér et al., 2005 ), meaning that the amount of available indicators and potential data sources is increasingly large. This new framing is also valuable as several concomitant and partially overlapping concepts and typologies may address similar sustainability issues (Reed et al., 2006 ), while the way in which practitioners and researchers conceive and apply indicators is inherently contingent (Heink and Kowarik, 2010 ). Future research could explore other pertinent typologies such as life-cycle stages or sustainability dimensions by replacing one of the tridimensional axes of the framing. In parallel to that process, complexity could also be closed down by identifying most critical indicators, for instance through Principal Component Analysis (PCA), as suggested by Steinmann et al. (2016) . One of the main scientific values of the present study is the comprehensive catalogue of indicators and the developed analytical methodology. The development of such a catalogue is however a complex process that should not be replicated as a mere accounting exercise. The complexity of collecting and comparing indicators from various measurement frameworks lies primarily in the plurality of approaches taken by the authoring institutions to determine their indicators. For example, the GGKP framework represents indicators at the level of collected data with at times multiple identified data sources. Meanwhile, other frameworks are less explicit and provide indicators that would correspond to “headline indicators” or “indicator categories” in other frameworks, with different levels of detail and technical concreteness. These varying levels of granularity, in addition to different aggregative levels such as sectors or emissions of specified air pollutants, are not only present between frameworks, but also within them. Figuratively speaking, catalogues such as the one here presented require collecting a plethora of pieces coming from different puzzles, implying that it is not possible to assemble a coherent picture without partially reshaping the pieces. Although rules and conditions may be developed to build such a harmonization, they are not applicable in all cases and imply context-specific interpretations. In addition, the results obtained in the present study, as previously noted, rely on intrinsically ambiguous typologies. The analytical scale may also influence the way in which a particular indicator is conceived and therefore, how it is subsequently categorized. In the same sense, a same issue or environmental problem may imply different screening results depending on the particular context at hand. The present study and its statistical analysis results are illustrative and must therefore be understood as being an explorative research on indicators at the conceptual level. Hence, any replication of this study should be adapted to their specific contexts, considering scales and objectives.  6 Conclusion The present study represents a systematic and empirical indicator-based articulation between SDGs and Natural Resources. It quantitatively and qualitatively analyzes the linkages between SDGs and NRs through the use of 494 Green Economy indicators collected from 12 different measurement frameworks. Results show that GE pays special attention to SDG 12 [Responsible Consumption and Production], while it largely ignores SDGs 4 [Quality Education]; 5 [Gender Equality]; 10 [Reduced inequalities]; 16 [Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions] and 17 [Partnerships for the Goals], which refer mostly to the social and institutional dimensions of sustainability. In terms of NRs, a great number of GE indicators indistinctly refer to multiple resources. Material and energy resources are also frequently referenced. Typical resource-based typologies were pertinent for categorizing 85% indicators. The simultaneous consideration of SDGs and NRs showed a plethora of interlinkages with very different intensities. In some particular cases, these links are characterized by strong direct identifications. An important result is that all SDGs are related to at least one NR through the perspective of GE indicators, although to different degrees. By additionally considering Environmental Functions and the MONET system within the materials sub-system, SDG-NR linkages and their respective characteristics were further elucidated. Although the results shown are dependent on subjective interpretations, the approach taken to demonstrate SDG-NR linkages through the use of GE indicators provides a valuable step forward in the effort toward the improved understanding of the complexity of sustainable resource management. The authors suggest the premises of an analytical framework which could prove useful for improving the understanding of the SDG-NR articulation and relevant for future research on complex and ambiguous concepts such as GE, the latter being largely shaped in the political arena. As shown in this paper, conceiving indicators not only as “data carriers”, but also as arguments or signals of particular concerns that may be simultaneously tackled through different perspectives, is a promising field of research to follow in both academia and practice.
