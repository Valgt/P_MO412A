                  The 2015 Paris Agreement, which was a global effort to address climate change and meet Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), established the Technology Mechanism Initiative as the key to facilitating technology transfer; however, the target SDGs of this initiative have not been identified. This study reviewed technical assistance (TA) project documents of the Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN), an organization under the Technology Mechanism Initiative, to analyze the general status of climate technology implementation, identify the targeted SDGs using sectoral classification, and examine the current national SDG statuses of TA-participating countries. While sectoral classifications have specific relationships with certain goals, SDGs 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 9 (Industry Innovation and Infrastructure), and 13 (Climate Action) were primarily referenced as they focused on energy and cross-sector applications. The evaluations also revealed that countries should prioritize poverty- and food-related SDGs. Therefore, expanding TA contributions to SDGs by better grouping sectoral classifications based on regional and local needs was essential because SDGs were linked to both sector-specific and climate technologies. Thus, a climate technology package based on sectoral classifications was proposed to bridge the gap between SDG attainment and the climate change objectives proposed by the Paris Agreement.

The 2015 Paris Agreement, which was a global effort to address climate change and meet Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), established the Technology Mechanism Initiative as the key to facilitating technology transfer; however, the target SDGs of this initiative have not been identified. This study reviewed technical assistance (TA) project documents of the Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN), an organization under the Technology Mechanism Initiative, to analyze the general status of climate technology implementation, identify the targeted SDGs using sectoral classification, and examine the current national SDG statuses of TA-participating countries. While sectoral classifications have specific relationships with certain goals, SDGs 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 9 (Industry Innovation and Infrastructure), and 13 (Climate Action) were primarily referenced as they focused on energy and cross-sector applications. The evaluations also revealed that countries should prioritize poverty- and food-related SDGs. Therefore, expanding TA contributions to SDGs by better grouping sectoral classifications based on regional and local needs was essential because SDGs were linked to both sector-specific and climate technologies. Thus, a climate technology package based on sectoral classifications was proposed to bridge the gap between SDG attainment and the climate change objectives proposed by the Paris Agreement.

As recent global problems cannot be managed individually, complementary global initiatives strive for sustainable growth by transitioning to a low-carbon society. Many global instruments and mechanisms for international collaboration have been developed to address climate change and environmental policy. Climate technology, which aims to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and adapt to the negative impacts of climate change, has become a good example of international collaboration (Amaro et al., 2019; Janetschek and Iacobuta, 2019; Le Blanc, 2015; Ockwell and Byrne, 2016 ). Its transfer has been emphasized since the founding of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (Anon, 1992 ). The Kyoto Protocol in 1997, an earlier climate change initiative, enacted the objectives of the UNFCCC using market-based mechanisms (Popp, 2011; Sterk et al., 2015 ), particularly GHG emission trades (Zhou et al., 2020 ). However, it failed to implement essential climate technologies for GHG reduction in developing countries during the Kyoto Protocol commitment period (Andersen et al., 2007; Sovacool, 2011; Anon, 1998 ). The Technology Mechanism was founded in 2010 during the 16th Conference of the Parties (COP) to facilitate technology transfer (Anon, 2011 ). Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, the Technology Mechanism established organizations and designed a distinctive management system involving two complementary arms: the Technology Executive Committee, which addresses policy, and the Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN), which addresses implementation. The CTCN encourages international development, dissemination, and climate technology transfer to developing countries, and the technical assistance (TA) service of technology transfer is one of its core tasks (Lee and Mwebaza, 2020 ). Technology transfer encompasses all climate actions related to mitigation and adaptation shared from one country to another. A host country, usually a developing country, requiring a technology transfer submits its request to the CTCN and a network member that can offer the requested climate technology responds. Therefore, climate technology directly contributes to climate-related actions and other environment-related problems, such as hunger, poverty, and water shortages, in developing countries (Ockwell and Byrne, 2016 ). These individual global problems can be undertaken in the SDGs. In other words, the CTCN can address international problems by achieving the SDGs as TA requests require specific SDG targets. Although climate change appears relevant only to SDG 13, other SDGs, including SDGs 2, 6, and 7, are indirectly connected to climate change through cross-cutting (Nilsson and Persson, 2017; Terama et al., 2016 ). Under the UN regime, technology transfer under TA establishes a relationship with SDGs by targeting specific SDGs from its technology requests, supporting the achievement of the SDGs. However, prior TA projects did not consider the status of requesting countries’ individual SDGs or national SDG frameworks. Therefore, reviewing the currently targeted SDGs of CTCN TA projects and identifying the genuine needs based on SDGs scores in the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) Dashboard to develop the appropriate directions for TA implementation is necessary. Considering the voluntary requests for climate technology achievement levels of the SDGs of individual countries, this study aims to support the successful implementation of voluntary and continuous climate transfer technologies to achieve the SDGs and aid climate change response.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Review methodology The methodological processes of reviewing TA project documents and their contributions toward SDGs are outlined in three phases ( Fig. 1 ). A general review of climate technology implementation based on CTCN TA project documents was first conducted. During this phase, TA project documents implemented by each country were reviewed, focusing on the number of annual project submissions, project objectives, and implementation status phases to determine their contribution toward SDGs. This included a review of the nominated sectoral classifications of climate technologies to verify the project’s characteristics and implementation in countries, essential in determining the contribution of technology transfer to climate technology sectors and identifying appropriate technologies that correspond to certain SDG goals (Nussbaumer et al., 2016; Prasad et al., 2017 ). In the second phase, individual sectoral classifications were reviewed with bound SDG contributions, which were grouped based on general reviews. Each SDG was classified and distinguished between sectoral classifications and specific goals. This study further reviewed key climate technologies by classifications included in the TA project documents that addressed specific goals and supported policy-making or funding proposals. Sectoral classifications bridge SDGs and the climate technologies that strive to improve and achieve them (Dialoke, 2017; Imaz and Sheinbaum, 2017 ). Finally, this study confirmed the national status of SDGs to determine potential climate technologies. Countries that devised TA project documents and countries with SDG evaluation results were first selected. Then, their SDG statuses were summarized based on gross national income (GNI) per capita, an important monetary indicator for understanding sustainable development (Allen et al., 2017; Girum and Wasie, 2017; Sinha et al., 2020 ). As SDGs are closely linked with climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts, securing them in certain countries is important for international investors and decision-makers (Bhaduri et al., 2016; Valentini et al., 2019 ). In addition, linking the global and national aspirations of SDGs is imperative in increasing environmental policy implementation (Biermann et al., 2017; Stafford-Smith et al., 2017 ). Understanding the current national SDG status can provide further insights into climate technology applications. Therefore, this study focused on the status of national SDG achievements using the index from the SDSN Dashboard, which has evaluation results for all participating countries.  2.2 Materials and data processing CTCN TA project documents and the SDSN Dashboard were used for the review process. This study obtained the TA project documents from the CTCN website, supplied according to the requests of individual countries within the technology transfer program, to determine the status of global climate technology transfer (Anon, 2020 ). A total of 254 TA project documents that had up-to-date climate technologies and contributions toward SDGs were listed on the website (accessed on September 30, 2021) and individually reviewed for this study. The SDSN evaluates the implementation status of each SDG goal and target using its Dashboard (Sachs et al., 2019a, 2019b ). Although each country uses different evaluation indicators and related data, the SDSN Dashboard evaluates all countries using the same SDG indicators and is regarded as representative data for country-specific SDG achievement status information (Anderson et al., 2017; Sachs et al., 2019a, 2019b; Wackernagel et al., 2017 ). This study used the most recent and available SDSN Dashboard data published in 2020, which are available online with metadata (accessed on October 10, 2021). The data were organized using qualitative SDG descriptions of green, yellow, orange, red, and gray, but because the metadata also contained scores, these were converted into quantitative values of 4, 3, 2, 1, and N/A (not available), respectively. GNI per capita data from the World Bank database were also used (accessed on October 10, 2021). To understand the characteristics of climate technology and SDGs, relative income was classified into five levels, each divided by the difference between the maximum and minimum GNI per capita values in the country where the project TA documents were implemented. Thus, the relative income levels had equal intervals. On this basis, the SDG scores from the SDSN Dashboard were grouped and verified.   3 Results 3.1 General review A total of 254 CTCN TA project documents were developed by 106 countries. Among these, 244 were implemented individually while ten were consortiums of various countries. Seven countries, namely Chad, El Salvador, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Niger, Palau, and Saint Lucia, participated in the CTCN TA projects only as a consortium. Asian countries, such as Thailand and Vietnam, generally implemented projects individually, whereas African countries formed consortiums ( Table 1 ). The results of the document review were categorized by the year submitted, project objectives, project phase, and contributions toward SDGs ( Fig. 2 ). Fig. 2 a presents the number of TA project document submissions from 2014 to 2020, as well as the 31 TA project documents submitted before July 2021. Among these documents, 66 projects were intended for climate change adaptation, 119 were aimed at climate change mitigation, and 69 aimed to achieve both purposes (cross-cutting) (Fig. 2 b). Considering the TA projects’ phases, the documents were classified as design, review, implementation, and completed (Fig. 2 c). The TA project documents also contained information on specific SDG contributions. Overall, most projects indicated three SDGs, while the maximum number was five. However, 52 did not indicate their SDG contributions. In total, SDGs were indicated 586 times (Fig. 2 d). Considering the annual changes in the number of TA project documents’ objectives (adaptation, mitigation, and cross-cutting), projects for mitigation were dominant in the early stages of CTCN (2014–2015), but more recent projects favored cross-cutting (2019–2020). Projects in 2021 before July targeted climate change adaptation. Meanwhile, the number of nominated SDGs in TA project documents fluctuated each year. SDG13 has consistently dominated, while SDG7 and SDG9 were prioritized over other SDGs. However, rising numbers of SDG2 and SDG6 were observed in 2021 as projects for adaptation increased ( Fig. 3 ). The documents had sectoral classifications with 29 combinations nominated because some included two or six sectors simultaneously. Considering overlaps, the sectoral classifications of TA project documents were summarized as agriculture and forestry (30 documents); industry, waste management, and carbon fixation (24); coastal zone (10); early warning and environmental assessment (11); energy (73); infrastructure, urban planning, and transport (23); water (17); and cross-sector (57). Note that nine documents did not include information about their sector classification ( Fig. 4 ). Documents that did not nominate sectors were submitted recently (2019–2021). The six submissions in 2021 mainly emphasized solar-powered irrigation, water management, water-filled flood, and aquifer mapping, which are directly connected to the water sector. Meanwhile, two focused on technology need assessments and generally aimed at climate change mitigation and adaptation and were thus classified as cross-sector. The remaining document from six East African countries, namely Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda, primarily focused on low- to medium-temperature geothermal systems. However, as sector focus varied by county, a cross-sectoral classification was selected. According to the sectoral classifications, participating countries generally implemented projects for cross-sector and energy efficiency goals. African and Latin American countries primarily formed consortiums to develop the TA projects for these sectors. Similarly, African and Oceanian countries, which initiated projects concerning coastal zones, also formed consortiums. However, agriculture and forestry; early warning and environmental assessment; industry, waste management, and carbon fixation; infrastructure, urban planning, and transport; and water TA projects were usually implemented individually ( Table 2 ).  3.2 Sectoral contribution of SDGs and climate change technology Each of the eight sectoral classifications had distinguished distributions with individual SDGs, of which SDG1 through SDG13 were the most frequently indicated. These distributions revealed the relationship between the projects and their indicated goals. The agriculture and forestry classification was highly related to SDG12 (indicated 13 times), SDG8 (7), and SDG15 (8), indicating that this sector is associated with food, infrastructure, and terrestrial ecosystems. The coastal zone classification correlated with SDG8 (3), SDG9 (5), and SDG11 (2). Unlike the other sectors, this sector was occupied by only seven goals. The cross-sector classification had an even allocation of all the SDGs because of its intersecting features. Among its 17 goals, SDG7 (16), SDG9 (12), and SDG17 (15) were most often used as objectives. SDG17 was not commonly indicated in the other sectoral classifications. Meanwhile, the early warning and environmental assessment sector consisted of SDG1 (3), SDG2 (4), and SDG6 (5), indicating that the projects were aimed at climate adaptation for damage prevention and reduction from water-related disasters, such as floods, tsunamis, and storms. Energy efficiency was highly associated with SDG7 (59), SDG8 (8), and SDG9 (14). Industry, waste management, and carbon fixation was most related to SDG7 (9), SDG9 (9), and SDG12 (6). Meanwhile, infrastructure, urban planning, and transport were related to SDG7 (4), SDG9 (10), and SDG11 (14). These three classifications have SDG7 and SDG9 in common because they are highly related to economic growth and development. However, they also have an additional goal depending on each sector’s attributes. Finally, the water classification correlated with SDG5 (4), SDG6 (14), and SDG9 (5). This sector is the second-best evenly distributed, but the essence of the projects favors SDG6, as it concerns clean water and sanitation ( Table 3 ). The 586 SDG indications in the review exhibited an asymmetric distribution. As previously mentioned, the most prevalent goal was SDG13 (climate change), which was indicated 199 times across sectors, accounting for 34.5% of the goals. This was followed by SDG7 (affordable and clean energy) at 93 indications (15.9%). Thus, these goals best represented the key characteristics of climate technology transfer. Conversely, the goal with the lowest proportion was SDG16 (peace, justice, and strong institutions), which was counted only once (0.2%), followed by SDG14 (life below water), indicated three times (0.5%), and then SDG4 (quality education), mentioned four times (0.7%) (Table 3 ). According to CTCN TA project documents, each sectoral classification required key climate technologies. For example, agriculture and forestry included 22 major technologies that improved crop yields and enabled climate adaptation along with cooking and heating technologies. The coastal zone focused on disaster risk reduction activities such as monitoring and included only nine technologies. The cross-sector classification covered 30 technologies with varying characteristics, including the support of national plan establishment, such as the National Adaptation Plan and Technology Needs Assessment, and provision of specific technologies, such as renewable energy or monitoring systems. In the case of early warning and environmental assessment, 13 key technologies which address disaster management, such as monitoring, early warning systems, and risk mapping, were included. The energy efficiency sector involved 43 technologies, making it the sector with the most technologies. These technologies aimed to deliver renewable energy, such as biogas, biomass, solar, wind, and thermal energies, and improve energy-efficient methods. In industry, waste management, and carbon fixation, 14 major waste-related technologies were included. Meanwhile, infrastructure, urban planning, and transport involved 12 technologies that cover building and public transportation management in response to climate change. Finally, the water sector had 16 technologies corresponding to water resource management, desalination, purification, and water-related disaster monitoring systems ( Table 4 ). Climate technologies in early warning and environmental assessment and water were indicated in SDGs 6 and 13. They shared the same four key technologies of Climate change monitoring, Climate change vulnerability assessment, Downscaling of climate model projections, and Seasonal to interannual weather forecast. These key technologies were associated with water-related disasters. In the case of energy efficiency and industry, waste management, and carbon fixation, SDGs 7 and 13 were allocated. Key technologies such as Biogas power, Biomass power, Energy supply from waster, and Integrated solid waste management appeared in both sectors.  3.3 National status of SDGs The countries implementing CTCN TA projects were classified into five relative income levels (high, upper-middle, middle, lower-middle, and low) based on an equal interval that considered their minimum and maximum GNI per capita. Central American and Caribbean countries were deemed high-income ($29,957–$37,350). Five countries with relatively large economic scales in Southeast Asia and South America, such as Chile and Malaysia, and island countries in East Africa and the Caribbean were considered upper-middle income ($22,562–$29,956). Middle-income countries ($15,169–$22,562), which totaled 15, included Latin American and several Eastern European countries, as well as Thailand and other island countries. Meanwhile, 28 countries were included in the lower-middle income group ($7775–$15,168) and 48 countries were included in the low-income group ($380–$7774). While many African and Central Asian countries exist at these two levels, countries in Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and Latin America were in the lower-middle income, and African countries mostly existed in the low-income interval. Although not divided geographically, the income levels according to the GNI per capita revealed rough spatial characteristics. Similarly, SDG evaluations also demonstrated distinctive characteristics according to income level. For example, the high and upper-middle income level countries scored lower than the low-middle and low-income level countries in SDG13, related to climate change. This trend was also observed for SDG12 and SDG15. Conversely, for SDG1, SDG3, and SDG7, the results of the SDG evaluations in countries with low incomes were worse than those of high-income countries. This tendency was also identified for SDGs 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 11 ( Table 5  and Fig. 4 ). Despite SDG scores by country having differences, overall trends of average scores were observed. For example, the high-income level countries had the fewest nominated SDGs. Differences among upper-middle, middle, and lower-middle-income level countries presented certain trends. As shown in Fig. 4 , the overall SDG score trends by relative income level revealed that the higher income countries had higher average SDG scores in SDGs 1–9, 11, and 16 and lower average scores in SDGs 12, 13, and 15. Note that for SDGs 10, 14, and 17, no trends were distinguished ( Fig. 5 ).   4 Discussion Based on the three-phase review results, TA technology transfer showed unbalanced support as a method for increasing SDG scores, revealing the disparity between low-score SDGs where support is needed and the actual support from TA. Resources were not invested into the SDGs that required aid. TA project documents mostly concentrated on the energy, industry, and infrastructure sectors, with SDGs 7–9, and 13 distinguished by their nominal SDG contribution. As SDG13 was a goal that all climate technology ultimately aims for, it appeared the most in the TA project documents. SDGs 7–9 were highly represented by energy, infrastructure, and cross-sectors in the sectoral classification, which all had notable characteristics, such as requiring large-scale facility investment, acting as social overhead capital, and managing common regional problems. Several countries formed consortiums that shared common needs when forming TA project documents. For example, 14 west African countries including Ghana, Nigeria, and Senegal, organized the consortium for the TA project “Mainstreaming gender for a climate resilient energy system in West Africa.” This project was categorized as cross-sectoral and related to SDG7. “West African coastal classification, hazard management and standardized communication scheme utilizing the Coastal Hazard Wheel,” was another example of a consortium project by African countries related to SDG9. These regional consortiums contribute to additional TA project applications and specifically indicate a lack of regional capacity. The consortium addresses the shared problems of the region and prevents the investment of additional resources by combining several projects into one. However, these countries, which had relatively low and lower-middle income, achieved low scores in SDG2, concerning poverty and food problems, which correlated with their current SDG evaluation status. As a result, the gap between technology needs, identified low-score SDGs, and technology implementation was determined. Future climate technology transfer should better address local needs and environmental circumstances by targeting local SDGs with low scores (Fuso Nerini et al., 2018; Puig et al., 2018 ). Contributing towards low-scoring SDGs is necessary to further climate technology implementation, as SDG13 and other SDGs have certain synergies (Fuso Nerini et al., 2019 ) which should be considered in TA project development processes and regional environmental policy building. Therefore, TA project documents should be developed to cover several SDGs according to appropriate climate technology packages. Currently, technology package does not have a precise definition, but several explanations involve climate or technology transfer. The Katowice climate package, the Climate Action Enhancement Package (CAEP), the European Union (EU) climate and energy package, and Technology Transfer Package (TTP) are four of the most well-known technology packages. The Katowice climate package, established in 2018 at COP 24, covers the operational rulebook to implement the Paris Agreement, excluding Article 6 (Voluntary cooperation) (Magnan and Ribera, 2016 ). The CAEP is supported under the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) partnership as a way to improve NDCs and increase their implementation by providing funding (Anon, 2020 ). The EU climate and energy package established in 2009 covers the renewable energy plan and emission trading system until 2020 (Skjærseth, 2016 ). Finally, the TTP is a collection of fundamental documents concerning technology transfer (Levy, 2016 ) and typically refers to a policy, funding framework, or knowledge-assembled document. Considering the existing descriptions of climate-related packages, this study defined a package as a set of sectoral classifications based on the desired results. These can be assembled for several classifications each targeting specific SDGs by binding climate technologies based on sector. An example is the climate-smart agriculture system that targets climate issues (SDG13) with gender equality (SDG4) in Africa (Mutenje et al., 2019 ). In Asia, SDG7 closely interacts with climate mitigation (SDG13), industry (SDG9), and economic growth (SDG8) (Sinha et al., 2020 ). Recent technologies for land-based GHG removal benefits all SDGs (Smith et al., 2019 ). Further, as climate technologies have close relationships with SDGs, their proper design could enhance the linkage between SDGs, thereby reducing the disparity between actual SDG status and current TA projects (Jarvis, 2020; Malley et al., 2021; Roy et al., 2021; Walsh et al., 2020 ). This, in turn, contributes to improving the synergy and tradeoff between climate technologies within a package (Anon, 2018 ). An appropriate package should include complementary SDGs and be used as a cross-cutting method (Bandari et al., 2022 ). This package could be implemented not only for technology transfer but also for projects such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and Sustainable Development Mechanism (SDM) to alleviate the mismatch between climate technology and SDGs. Moreover, COP 26 identified GCF and SDM as key factors for the Paris Agreement. Discussing how to manage the gap between climate change and SDGs is essential and this package program could narrow that gap regarding capacity building. In addition, the NDC Synthesis report generated by the UNFCCC stressed the link between climate change and SDGs (Anon, 2021 ). This study had limited data on the technology demand of countries, countries requiring climate technology transfers but did not submit requests to the CTCN, and individual SDG evaluations. However, as current TA project documents have only begun marking SDGs that can be contributed based on science and technology transfer, future TA project document design should consider the synergies among SDGs based on appropriate local environmental and development policies. Therefore, future research should develop an SDG evaluation system from the perspective of not only individual countries but also technology transfer.  5 Conclusions In this review, the primary SDGs nominated for implemented TA project documents were SDGs 7–9, and 13. SDGs are linked to sectoral classification, with the most referenced SDGs correlating with energy and cross-sector projects. However, the SDG evaluation scores of individual countries revealed that problems such as poverty and food are more serious than SDGs 7–9, and 13. Similarly, climate technologies within a sectoral classification were also linked to SDGs. On this basis, the scope of SDG contributions increases when technologies are grouped according to regional and local needs. In November 2021, COP 26 addressed the Paris Agreement and finalized the Paris rulebook. This new climate regime considers technology mechanisms as a key factor in mitigating GHG emissions by developing countries that did not participate in the agreement because of their economic growth. Technology transfer provides opportunities for these countries to develop an eco-friendly infrastructure and improve national SDGs. This study aimed to suggest methods to achieve the SDGs using technology transfer under the climate change regime. Although only SDG13 appears related to climate technology, CTCN TA project documents with individual sectoral classifications had specific and complementary intended goals that contributed to climate action. In addition, the relationship between climate change and SDGs has been acknowledged internationally, but no suggestions have been made to address their connection. Therefore, a climate technology package that considers the synergy and tradeoff between sectoral classifications was proposed to support climate change mitigation and improve SDGs.
